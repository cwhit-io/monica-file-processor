[time=58] (upbeat music)
[time=89] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and allow me the privilege of saying welcome to the broadcast.
[time=96] We're so thankful that you've tuned in again and we're so looking forward to the opportunity that God has given us to minister to you, to encourage you, to do our best to come alongside you in this coming year.
[time=110] We're so grateful for what he did in '04.
[time=113] And yet as we look ahead to this coming year of life and ministry, we can't wait to see what he's gonna do in our lives and to see what he is going to do in yours.
[time=125] The stories that we continue to hear just encourages greatly.
[time=129] And we're so thankful for the communication that you give us and the opportunity he allows us to be a part of your life in this way.
[time=138] The message that you're gonna hear today is a message that we gave this past Sunday and it has to do with the issue of money that has to do with the issue of finances and specifically giving your readiness and mine, our willingness to give back to God in our offerings, to give back to God in a way that would truly be God honoring and consistent with the principles for giving that he lays out for us in Scripture.
[time=163] Now let me say this to you.
[time=165] I know that there are many of you who watch and you have home churches and you've been schooled or taught or educated somewhat in the truths of Scripture and I would imagine many of you give and I would pray that today's message would simply further and deepen, if you will, that commitment that you have.
[time=185] We want you to give because it honors God because it's obedient and we believe in the church and whatever church you're a part of, whatever family you've connected with, our hope is that this truth that you hear today will just further and strengthen that commitment.
[time=202] Others of you don't know what to do.
[time=205] Others of you are new to this walk of faith.
[time=208] You're not quite sure what the Bible says about giving and so our hope and prayer is that as you listen today, you would be encouraged and more than encouraged that you would allow yourself to be taught and guided in this very, very important process.
[time=223] Open your hearts and minds today, see what God will have for you as you consider taking all that he has given you, whether it's a little bit or a lot, taking all that he has given you and you and I being willing to hold it out there for him, willing to give it back, willing to give it back sacrificially.
[time=243] God's word says that when you're willing and I'm willing to give back and when we do that on a regular basis, when we do that with sacrificial hearts, when we do that in a way that stretches our faith, he says he promises you and I that he will bless that kind of effort and so I hope for and pray for that kind of blessing in your life.
[time=263] Listen today, see what his word has for you and I can't wait to see how it develops and grows your giving heart.
[time=272] Hey, we also thought we'd just have some fun today with it being so cold and so rainy or so snowy.
[time=280] It's just so wintery, you know what I mean?
[time=283] These days are hard days sometimes to kind of plow through, no pun intended.
[time=287] We just thought we'd have a little bit of fun and take you back six months to a day that our whole team had together at the local pool as we kind of did a music video.
[time=298] Having fun and also in a serious way as you listen to the song, kind of capturing the heart of the guys on this team, we are so thankful that we have been allowed the privileged to dive in.
[time=310] We have been given the privilege by God to be a part of a ministry that absolutely encourages us and we're diving in and we're gonna stay in and we're gonna keep swimming and keep giving ourselves to what he has allowed us to be a part of here.
[time=326] So enjoy the video, you'll see the sun, you'll see the water and who knows, it might warm you up a little bit.
[time=333] God bless you and have a great day.

[time=501] [MUSIC - 55 seconds]
[time=567] [AMEN] - Well, what a joy and privilege to be able to be together
[time=576] and to spend these last few minutes as we have.
[time=579] It is definitely my friend's time for, as Corbin mentioned earlier, definitely time for the church to step up in the midst of this recent tragedy, evil certainly has.
[time=595] I think these are times when it's good to just be reminded of some sound biblical truth.
[time=601] Gal asked me last week that I think the tsunami was God's wrath on all the Muslims who lived in Thailand.
[time=608] And I'd graciously said, no, I don't think that.
[time=614] God did not author the tsunami.
[time=617] Church, remember God is not the author of evil and God did not author disaster.
[time=625] The tsunami, remember, just good doctrine would remind you and I that the tsunami and this disaster goes back to the garden, it goes back to the beginning of sin.
[time=636] God never intended for tsunamis.
[time=638] God never intended for it to be that way, but when he gave choice and when the choice was made and when the choice made was sin, with that choice, with sin came not only personal dysfunction, but natural dysfunction.
[time=658] And the natural disasters that we see, things of this magnitude in nature, do not assign to him, his heart was broken as he watched the devastation of what transpired.
[time=670] Did he and his sovereignty allow it?
[time=672] Yes, just like he allowed you to do what you did last night or last Wednesday.
[time=682] His choice, his freedom of choice, his giving you and I that and it being handled the way it was then brings about a broken world, a broken relationship with him and a broken universe that does not function the way he intended.
[time=700] And so it is time for us as the church to step up in the face of evil, not only the evil of the disaster, but reports even lately would indicate that now children three to 13 are coming up missing from refugee camps and aid stations, that's right.
[time=715] Now they fear that children three to 13 are being kidnapped, taken into physical and sexual slavery, shipped off to other parts of the world, little boys and girls without moms and dads, without protection and guidance.
[time=729] And that would just be one of the ways in which we see evil now rearing its head and so yes, it's time.
[time=739] Your $100 or your $50 or your $10, your $10,000, it all might help.
[time=746] But we will as a church, I promise you this, we will continue to consider what roles we might could play and even other families here in this city, I'm sure.
[time=755] Well, it was a few months ago that I stood here
[time=762] and gave you all the opportunity, you may remember this, gave you the chance to take part in what was a church-wide survey.
[time=770] Do you remember that?
[time=771] We passed out the surveys, you took a few minutes and filled out some very, very important information, you responded to some very, very important questions.
[time=780] We as a staff and leadership, as an elder board, we can sit back in rooms behind closed doors and we can kind of get a subjective feel for how it's going at Black Hawk Ministries today.
[time=795] We'll often ask each other questions and we'll often kind of pull information from here or there but subjectively we can sense that things might be going well or we may need some help over here and I don't think there's anything wrong with the subjective leading of the spirit and the insight that he brings, but I think it's also very valuable that we would objectively give you an opportunity to help us see what in fact God is doing.
[time=820] And so you gave us about 10, 15 minutes that morning.
[time=823] There were between 13 and 1500 respondents to our church wide survey, which gives us a great, a great figure.
[time=830] It gives us great feedback and I wanted this morning to not go through all of that with you but I wanted to just share some things that as I went through it, I felt like would be encouraging for you to see, encouraging for you to know.
[time=843] Many of the things that we learned very, very positive, very encouraging, we're so grateful for what we see God doing.
[time=851] Other things brought I think a healthy sense of concern and I'll share a few of those with you but let me just take you through a few of the responses.
[time=859] One of the questions we asked was how long you had been attending Blackhawk?
[time=863] How long you'd been attending Blackhawk Ministries?
[time=866] 43% of you checked the boxes that ranged in the less than three years arena.
[time=874] And we were really encouraged by that.
[time=877] On two fronts, the stability and wisdom of longtime members, the stability and wisdom that comes with those who have been here for more than three years, more than 10, more than 20.
[time=889] That is much needed.
[time=891] That is a good thing and there are, as you can tell, a few of those here, we need their guidance and we need their years of walking with God and we need their commitment to Him in this place but there is nothing like the energy and life that comes from those who are new.
[time=908] If you're new in this place, in that under three year category, we are so grateful that you're here and so thankful for the energy and life that you bring.
[time=916] Next question, I believe Blackhawk's current worship services.
[time=921] Everything that has transpired from the moment you walked in this morning until now and these next 30 or 40 minutes included.
[time=929] I believe Blackhawk's current worship services provide meaningful opportunities to connect with God while expressing my love and devotion to Him.
[time=939] Now, before you see the result, understand, this issue right here splits churches every week in this country.
[time=948] See, people get up and leave churches because what transpires from the time they walk in those doors, the music and the guitars and the drums and the hymns or the praise songs and the suit and tie or the lack thereof.
[time=962] I mean, all across the board, people have got issues and they want to stand and fight for those preferential issues and it ruins churches.
[time=973] It divides people.
[time=975] It breaks fellowship.
[time=977] And it was so encouraging to look at this and realize that 93% check the boxes ranging from mildly to strongly agree.
[time=988] And just so you can be encouraged, you know what?
[time=991] I don't hear anything like that today.
[time=996] I used to.
[time=997] I don't hear anything today about anything.
[time=1000] I don't hear people talking about music and I don't hear people talking about certain instruments and I don't hear people talking about, you know, this, I just, I don't hear it.
[time=1010] I hear, by and large, nothing but encouraging words from people who are grateful for what our musicians and our artists bring to this family in their effort to guide and lead you to worship.
[time=1021] Amen?
[time=1023] I would describe my current relationship.
[time=1025] This was really encouraging for me and for many others.
[time=1028] I would describe my current relationship with Christ compared to one year ago.
[time=1033] Think about that.
[time=1034] Compared to one year ago, 76% of you checked the box that indicated somewhat to dramatically improved.
[time=1043] That was really encouraging to see.
[time=1046] I have appreciated and have personally benefited from the team teaching format currently being used at times in the Sunday morning worship services.
[time=1056] You all know how much Mitchell and Steve mean to me.
[time=1060] We have been so blessed and so gifted by God to have those who can come and teach and proclaim what is true.
[time=1066] I love them and I love the diversity that they bring.
[time=1070] You know, 'cause I've told you so many times I never wanted to be a part of a church that just had one voice.
[time=1076] One voice and only one voice, I think, is dangerous because God has brought together a family that is diverse.
[time=1084] Different styles and different ways and different means.
[time=1086] I mean, it's all very, very healthy, I believe.
[time=1089] Plus, the time it allows me on a week when someone else would be teaching, the opportunity it gives me to give myself to the leadership side of my life.
[time=1098] There's two parts of my life.
[time=1099] There's the here.
[time=1101] There's the leadership side and the teaching side.
[time=1103] And when you're teaching that week, your week is consumed with the teaching side.
[time=1107] And on those weeks when I'm not, I get the privilege of being more involved in the leadership side of that endeavor.
[time=1113] And I love being able to do both and I'm so thankful for those guys and the help that they bring and 82% of you check the boxes that range from mildly to strongly agreeing with that statement and we were so thankful for that.
[time=1127] I believe Blackhawk provides a setting where people feel welcomed and accepted as they explore a personal relationship with Christ.
[time=1138] I'll tell you what, for those who are exploring a relationship with Christ, for those who are looking for a place to fit and belong, this is a huge test right here.
[time=1148] For those of us who open these doors and welcome them in, 93% of you check the boxes anywhere from mildly to strongly agreeing with that statement.
[time=1161] And I'm so grateful that you are a warm and inviting people.
[time=1165] You have gone out of your way, many of you, weekend and week out to help those who come in.
[time=1170] It's a big place, there's a lot of people.
[time=1173] It can be very intimidating and I have heard again and again and again that from greeters to those in the pew, you have made people feel extremely welcomed.
[time=1182] And that's a good thing.
[time=1183] In the last 12 months, I have personally invited the following number of people to attend a worship service here at Blackhawk with me in the last 12 months.
[time=1194] Important question, I think.
[time=1195] Some of you might say, you know what dumb question.
[time=1198] Why are you asking that?
[time=1199] God just brings 'em, he doesn't need me.
[time=1203] Well, you know what, God does bring 'em, right?
[time=1206] And who does God use?
[time=1208] You, God brings you, God uses you, God uses it.
[time=1212] I don't know why he chose to do it that way.
[time=1215] But again and again, you know what?
[time=1217] Sometimes they come in from just driving by, they do.
[time=1221] Sometimes they come in from the Bible hour in the broadcast, but time and time and time.
[time=1225] Again, we realize that people come because they were invited.
[time=1229] A warm invitation to come to a life-changing place with a spirit of God as it worked.
[time=1235] I mean, it's an amazing privilege.
[time=1238] 63% of you check the boxes that range from one to six people in the last 12 months.
[time=1245] Well done, it's encouraging, it's encouraging to see that.
[time=1250] The thing that was concerning to me as I look through that was that 31% of you checked the box that said nobody.
[time=1257] Zero, zilch, nada, nothing.
[time=1262] No invitation extended.
[time=1264] What's that about?
[time=1267] You didn't have the opportunity?
[time=1272] Well, I don't know about that.
[time=1274] But think about it.
[time=1276] Maybe just if that's you, just open your heart to what God may want to do with you.
[time=1282] And that extended invitation, that hand that reaches out that says, hey, why don't you come with me?
[time=1287] It could be a neighbor, it could be a friend, it could be a co-worker, it could be a family member.
[time=1291] But like it or not, he uses you and me.
[time=1296] I don't get it, but he does.
[time=1298] So you and I, I think, need to be willing to extend that invitation.
[time=1302] This was very encouraging, the following statement best describes my relationship with Christ.
[time=1309] The following statement best describes my relationship with Christ.
[time=1313] I have fully surrendered my life to Christ and am confident of that relationship 88% of you.
[time=1321] Check that box.
[time=1323] I have fully surrendered my life to him and am confident of that relationship.
[time=1327] Watch this, 12% check the box.
[time=1330] I have not yet fully surrendered to Christ but am actively seeking.
[time=1337] That really, really said a lot to me.
[time=1340] That tells me that this place, you, this family, is a safe place for people to come and hear a life-changing message.
[time=1350] And it might take as God kind of oversees that process.
[time=1354] He sometimes does that in two, three weeks.
[time=1356] He sometimes does that with someone in two or three months.
[time=1359] But if in the process, they feel like they can come through these doors with the questions that they have, the needs that they have, the confusion that they might be experiencing and know that you will accept them as they're in process.
[time=1373] I think that's a wonderful characteristic.
[time=1376] And I'm so thankful that you've allowed 12% to sit here each week in the midst of their journey.
[time=1383] I would say this was great to see.
[time=1385] I would say my life has been fully surrendered to Christ for 61% checked the box more than 10 years.
[time=1395] What would it look like if that was 95%?
[time=1401] What would a church feel like?
[time=1405] What kind of life and energy would there be if 95?
[time=1408] See, 61% checked that box more than 10 years.
[time=1412] 39% checked the boxes indicating 10 years or less.
[time=1418] And you know what I'm really encouraged by that?
[time=1420] If you had asked me what I thought a good mix would be on that one, I would have said 60/40.
[time=1425] And so when I saw that 61/39, and it kind of goes back to the one we started with, there's just something really, really good and healthy about the stability of those who have known the Lord for some time.
[time=1437] And there's something really, really healthy about the new life and energy that those newer to their faith bring to the process and to the place.
[time=1444] So that was good.
[time=1445] On the financial side of things, which we're going to talk about this morning, on the financial or stewardship side of things, we asked, this was one question we asked, I would estimate the percentage of my income that I annually give to Blackhawk is, and it said 60%, 60% checked the boxes indicating less than 10%.
[time=1470] Now, is that good or bad?
[time=1471] Well, that's kind of why we're going to talk about what we're going to talk about and study from God's word this morning and next week as well.
[time=1480] What about this 10% issue?
[time=1483] What about this giving issue?
[time=1485] How much should I give?
[time=1486] What is God honoring as far as my giving?
[time=1491] We'll talk about that.
[time=1492] We'll look to God's word and see.
[time=1494] 60% of you, though, check the boxes less than 10%.
[time=1497] Here was a second question along those lines.
[time=1499] I feel adequately taught and informed with regards to a biblical approach to financial giving.
[time=1506] 60% of you checked the boxes ranging from mildly to strongly agreeing, which is a very, very encouraging figure.
[time=1515] It really is.
[time=1515] I'm glad that there are that many of you who feel adequately taught and informed about biblical giving.
[time=1522] But it begs the next question, which is what about the 40% of you?
[time=1530] 40% folks, that's a decent-sized chunk of folks who would sit here in this room this morning and say, you know what, I don't really get it.
[time=1541] I don't feel adequately taught or informed as to the biblical guidelines for giving.
[time=1547] And so when I see things like that and as we consider just somewhat regular reminders and teachings on this issue, we felt like this would be a good time today and next week to just look at this issue of biblical, fully-surrendered giving.
[time=1563] We'll do this this morning.
[time=1565] And we will do this next week as well.
[time=1567] Don't miss next week.
[time=1568] We've got baptisms scheduled for Sunday morning next week.
[time=1572] And it is going to be just as it always is, so incredibly encouraging to hear their stories and to be a part of that.
[time=1579] And in the following week, the 23rd, it is our yearly gift.
[time=1584] I'll tell you, we are so blessed.
[time=1585] I'm so thankful for him.
[time=1587] And he's going to come again January 23rd, Dr. Al Jennings from Summit Church International here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1593] He'll be here on the 23rd.
[time=1594] And then the 30th, I'll tell you what, we are so looking forward to the beginning of a verse by verse study of the great book of 1 Peter.
[time=1603] So you can be reading 1 Peter and getting acquainted with 1 Peter, it is a challenging and exciting book.
[time=1610] And we will just dive in on Sunday morning, January 30th, and begin to make our way through that.
[time=1615] But as it relates to giving, and as I read through these results that we saw from you, I'm convinced that there are growing numbers of people wanting and needing to understand foundational biblical principles, guidelines, for God-honoring, worshipful giving.
[time=1632] For some of you in the room this morning, you know these principles.
[time=1635] For some of you in the room this morning, you have adapted and applied these principles in your giving life for numbers of years.
[time=1641] And for that, we are very, very grateful.
[time=1644] But for many of you here in the room today, and for others of you watching on the broadcast, you've got questions.
[time=1651] You function with some giving misconceptions and some confusion in your heart and soul as it relates to giving finances, stewardship and the church and how all that works.
[time=1666] And you know what, based upon the background that many of you come from, based upon what you've seen or experienced in the past, some of you and the religious or spiritual backgrounds that you may come out of and stuff that you saw transpire in this arena, in those settings, many of you should be confused.
[time=1691] And uncertain as to how this is really supposed to work.
[time=1696] I'll give you an example of that.
[time=1700] No kidding.
[time=1701] I talked to a guy about a year and a half ago, when he said it, I thought he was kidding.
[time=1705] And I said, you gotta be kidding.
[time=1707] And he said, no, I'm not kidding.
[time=1710] He thought all the offerings each week came to me.
[time=1715] I mean, I kind of asked him about it.
[time=1720] And he thought, yeah, he thought literally after second service every week, somehow I walked upstairs and I just got all the offering.
[time=1728] And then I, and here's the financial minds around here, I'll laugh at this one.
[time=1732] Then he thought that I was the one that would sufficiently then distribute all the money in the ways that it should be distributed, which would be catastrophic if that's how it were supposed to happen.
[time=1743] But that's what he thought.
[time=1745] 'Cause somehow that's what he got taught.
[time=1750] One individual thought that elders, elders and founding members, they thought elders and founding members were those financially responsible for the financial support of the church.
[time=1762] Another couple I met with once hadn't given in two years, two years because they hadn't figured out how to obtain giving envelopes.
[time=1769] They hadn't found out how to get the envelopes, so they hadn't given in two years.
[time=1774] Well, I got them some envelopes.
[time=1776] That first envelope was big.
[time=1778] I got them a real big first one.
[time=1780] One woman told me recently of a pastor,
[time=1786] her pastor who had embezzled $150,000,
[time=1793] left his wife and three kids and 200 faithful Christ followers in a small church in Southern Indiana.
[time=1803] Never to be seen again.
[time=1807] And she looked at me, reluctantly, sincerely, looked at me and said, "Pastor," said to me, "Pastor, I'm sorry, I just don't trust you." And I said to her, "You know what?
[time=1823] I understand, I do." And maybe God'll give us some time here together and maybe your trust can be restored.
[time=1833] Maybe as we live life together and as you are a part of a place that hopefully conducts itself in that arena with some level of respect and integrity, your trust can be renewed.
[time=1846] My friends, there are a lot of issues that come with giving and finances and church.
[time=1852] And oftentimes, an assortment of questions, and so let's do this this morning.
[time=1857] If you've got your Bibles, open up to 1 Corinthians 16.
[time=1860] We could go to a number of different passages to kind of come at this biblically here this morning.
[time=1866] We'll go to 1 Corinthians 16, and we will read it, and then we will ask God for guidance as we study it and then address a series of giving questions.
[time=1878] It's great how the passage kind of unfolds.
[time=1880] We can kind of ask some giving, stewardship questions and find some biblical answers as we go, found right here in the text in 1 Corinthians 16 and in honor of God's word.
[time=1893] Would you stand with me as I read this for us this morning, 1 Corinthians, Paul's letter, his first letter, the church at Corinth, they had written him, now he responds, and you see in chapter 16 verse one, these words.
[time=1908] Now, concerning the collection for the saints, they had obviously raised this question.
[time=1915] They had obviously, like you and I, had some misunderstandings or some questions about how this should function.
[time=1921] So he says now concerning the collection for the saints.
[time=1925] As I directed the churches of Galatia, which would have also included Macedonia and Achaia, and we'll see that in just a moment.
[time=1933] As I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also.
[time=1938] On the first day of every week, each one of you is to put aside and save as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come.
[time=1949] Don't have the collections when I come, don't have the collections going on already.
[time=1954] When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
[time=1960] The church in Jerusalem was in need.
[time=1962] The church in Jerusalem, though the center of the New Testament church age, though that's where it began, as Jewish people would come to faith in Messiah, as they would convert to a biblical Christianity.
[time=1976] See, they would face much persecution, oftentimes the loss of job and income.
[time=1982] And so though a great and faithful bunch of folks, they were oftentimes, especially in these early days, financially destitute.
[time=1990] And so the church of God rises up and Paul, in many, many instances is the one who provokes this.
[time=1998] When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
[time=2004] And if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me.
[time=2008] Let's pray.
[time=2008] God, we come before you this morning humbly, admitting that this is an arena.
[time=2016] God, that we know you speak to.
[time=2019] You speak to husbands and wives, and you speak to parents, and you speak to appropriate behavior in the workplace, and God, you speak to the function of the church.
[time=2027] You speak in so many, you speak to so many different arenas of life.
[time=2032] And in those arenas, God, it is so clear.
[time=2034] God, today I pray that your word to us financially, God, that it would be as clear.
[time=2041] It is, God, I pray that our eyes and our hearts would be open to that clarity.
[time=2045] God, I pray that your spirit would move deep in each and every one of us, so that we would know beyond a shadow of a doubt, God, so that we would know with real personal, spiritual clarity how it is you would want us to respond, not only today, but in the days and weeks and months to come.
[time=2065] God, give us that kind of insight.
[time=2066] God, grow us this morning.
[time=2068] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=2070] You may be seated.
[time=2071] Well, let's just jump in.
[time=2073] What do you say with the purpose of giving?
[time=2077] The purpose of giving.
[time=2078] Oftentimes people will ask me, Kelly, what is the point?
[time=2081] I mean, what is it really about?
[time=2083] Paul answers that question for us right here.
[time=2085] The purpose of giving, you see it there in verse one.
[time=2088] Now concerning the collection, and then read those next three words out loud.
[time=2093] Go ahead.
[time=2094] Now that was pathetic.
[time=2098] Now concerning the collections, what?
[time=2101] For the saints, for the saints.
[time=2105] There you have it right there.
[time=2106] The text states here in verse one, and scripture speaks repeatedly to this truth in other passages that primarily, hear me now, primarily, not only, but primarily.
[time=2119] New Testament biblical giving is for the saints.
[time=2125] Now, who's that?
[time=2127] You sit there and you say, well, that's certainly in me.
[time=2130] I'm no saint.
[time=2131] Well, let's have some teaching here this morning.
[time=2134] You know what?
[time=2135] If you know the Lord Jesus Christ, if you live today in a fully surrendered relationship with him, if you have come to faith in him, God's word refers to you as one set apart.
[time=2146] You are a holy one.
[time=2149] God's word again and again refers to you and I as believers, as members of the body of Christ, the church we are referred to as saints.
[time=2162] How's that feel?
[time=2164] Get used to that.
[time=2165] You're a saint.
[time=2166] You are a holy set apart vessel.
[time=2169] And giving in the scriptures, in the New Testament pattern is again and again and again, stated to be for the purpose of the saints, for the support of and the furthering of ministry in the church, the gathering of the believers.
[time=2184] The saints in Christ Jesus.
[time=2187] We see this in a number of different places.
[time=2190] You can write this down in 2 Corinthians 8 in his second letter to the church at Corinth.
[time=2196] Paul refers to this very idea.
[time=2198] In 2 Corinthians 8, 1 to 5, we'll kind of flip through this real quick, follow along.
[time=2203] 2 Corinthians 8, 1.
[time=2204] Now brethren, he says, we wish to make known to you the grace of God, which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that in a great ordeal of affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty.
[time=2218] These churches that Paul went to in Macedonia and Achaia and Galatia.
[time=2223] Remember, he referred to that in 1 Corinthians 16.
[time=2226] These folks, these saints, the body of Christ, he says in these places, had two things going on.
[time=2232] They had their abundance of joy, the joy that comes from knowing the Lord, living in a life-changing relationship with them.
[time=2240] They had their abundance of joy, he says, and along with their joy, they had this thing called deep poverty.
[time=2247] These people were not well off.
[time=2251] These people did not have the cash flowing.
[time=2255] They had great joy and they had great poverty.
[time=2258] And in a great ordeal of affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their giving, in the wealth of their liberality.
[time=2270] In verse three, it says, for I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability, according to their ability, you and I, sitting down with the pad and pen and the calculator going, what can I do, to what degree can I offer?
[time=2287] According to their ability, kind of carries with it the notion of what I humanly can kind of think through, but then see spiritually.
[time=2294] Spiritually something amazing kicks in and that is when your faith and mind allows us to move beyond.
[time=2303] What we believe ourselves to be able, according to their ability and beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord, why?
[time=2314] Begging us with much urging for the favor of, it would be a favor to them.
[time=2320] These joyful, poverty-stricken people are saying to Paul, it would be a favor to us if you would allow us to participate in the support of the who, say it, saints.
[time=2332] New Testament giving for the saints.
[time=2335] And this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord.
[time=2340] They first gave themselves to Him and then to us, by the will of God.
[time=2348] You can see the same thing in Romans 15, right?
[time=2349] That down, if you're taking notes this morning under the purpose of giving, the purpose of giving being for the support and furthering of ministry among the saints, Romans 15, 23 to 28, Paul says, but now with no further place for me in these regions.
[time=2363] And since I have had for many years a longing to come to you, he writes to those in Rome, "Whenever I go to Spain, for I hope to see you in passing "and to be helped on my way there by you "when I have first enjoyed your company for a while." And then he says in 25, "But now I am going to Jerusalem "serving the saints." That's right, what does that mean?
[time=2383] Well, Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
[time=2392] Yes, they were pleased to do so.
[time=2395] And they are indebted to them, for if the Gentiles have shared in there the Jews who have come to faith their spiritual things, they are the Gentiles who now know the Lord.
[time=2407] They are indebted to minister to them, the Jews who have come to faith also in material things.
[time=2414] Therefore, when I have finished this and have put my seal on this fruit, this gift of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.
[time=2424] succinctly stated, folks, God's people gave to the God-ordained ministry of God's chosen primary ministry vessel.
[time=2432] Let me say that one more time.
[time=2435] God's people gave to the God-ordained ministry of God's chosen primary ministry vessel, the church.
[time=2444] So it could grow, so it could do its work, so its work could be furthered.
[time=2452] Is the church God's only ministry vessel that he uses today?
[time=2457] Yes or no?
[time=2459] No, no, no, no.
[time=2460] There are organizations, my friends, there are people, there are groups, there are other ministries, many of whom I support, many of whom we support, who I believe to be God-ordained.
[time=2471] God uses them in spectacular, amazing ways.
[time=2475] But God's word is clear.
[time=2476] That is not to be the primary place of your offering.
[time=2482] And mine, our primary gift, our primary offering is to the church.
[time=2487] God allows you to give kind of above and beyond that.
[time=2490] Wonderful, do it, do it.
[time=2494] Do it liberally, do it radically.
[time=2497] But understand God's design, as stated here in the text, is for us to primarily give to the church.
[time=2505] Number two, the principles of giving, the principles of giving, the primary purpose, is for the church.
[time=2513] Now we find as the text continues, the principles, we see four principles to guide you and I in our worshipful giving, four principles.
[time=2526] And I really hope you're taking notes this morning.
[time=2528] I really hope you'll write this down.
[time=2530] The purpose is for the church.
[time=2532] Yes, we're to give to those in need.
[time=2534] Yes, we're to give to those who have physical needs and spiritual needs.
[time=2539] Galatians 6, 10 says we're to do good to all men.
[time=2543] That's true.
[time=2544] But that same verse ends by saying, especially to those who are the household of faith.
[time=2550] So scripture makes a really clear statement on the purpose of giving.
[time=2555] Now let's look at four principles that can guide you and I in our regular New Testament giving.
[time=2562] Let's start with the period of giving.
[time=2564] Or like I said, let's answer some questions.
[time=2567] How about this one, when?
[time=2569] When to give.
[time=2571] First principle, principle number one, the period of giving or when should we give.
[time=2579] First principle is that the most appropriate period for giving would appear to be biblically stated, would appear to be on the, as the text itself says, on the first day of the week.
[time=2593] When to give, the Bible seems to indicate that there should be giving done on a weekly basis.
[time=2600] Now this not only convinces us that the church met on Sunday, the first day of every week, but that its worship included regular giving of money.
[time=2610] Giving should not be sporadic.
[time=2613] Giving should not happen just when you or I just kind of feel generous.
[time=2619] That should not necessarily just be as the spirit leads.
[time=2623] The spirit may of course lead us to give it special times and in special ways, that's good, but it's primary leading in giving as in everything else in this life of ours is through scripture.
[time=2636] What he wants you and I to do in life, we find in scripture, in scripture here clearly indicates and mentions giving on an every week basis.
[time=2646] Now hear me please on this.
[time=2647] I do not believe that Paul is prescribing a legalistic requirement.
[time=2653] This has not become a black and white man-dated thing where we've got folks at the doors checking for envelopes.
[time=2661] It's not what this is about.
[time=2662] This is not some rigidly pursued setting out or a part of our money so that we can be sure to have something to put in the offering plate because if you're spiritual, that's what spiritual people do.
[time=2674] They always have a gift every week.
[time=2678] Some of you are paid monthly, some of you are paid quarterly.
[time=2681] Here's the point here.
[time=2684] The point is that giving, hear this.
[time=2687] Giving is part of worship.
[time=2694] Giving to him, sacrificial offerings are an act of worship and they are a part of the fellowship that we share.
[time=2702] And even when we have nothing significant to give, you may not, whatever significant means for you, whatever that set up part amount is that you've agreed to, that is sacrificial and that stretches your faith.
[time=2716] Even if you can't bring that each and every wink, you and I would bring something as an act of worship, as an act of fellowship.
[time=2727] We can be sensitive to the needs of the church and to our part in meeting them.
[time=2733] Sunday giving appears as a mandated element of worship, part of the duty of a new covenant priest, offering up, as it says in 1 Peter 2, spiritual sacrifices to God.
[time=2747] Our giving should not be based on periodic emotional appeals or feelings or on bonus income, but on regular willing and grateful commitment of our possessions to him, to his people and to his work.
[time=2761] You see, that allows every believer, that allows every one of us each week to consider these things.
[time=2768] Each week, it gives you and I the privileged opportunity to think about stewardship and the sacrifice of giving, weekly giving raises sensitivity to financial spiritual stewardship so that giving is seen as an ongoing regular spiritual discipline and responsibility.
[time=2791] Practically, okay, practically just some things to consider.
[time=2794] Saturday night, try this one, Saturday night, why don't we help our kids prepare their offering?
[time=2802] Saturday night, why don't as a family, you know, or as a couple, why don't you actually set aside some time to actually help them get their offering together?
[time=2815] And to just talk about it for a few minutes and to just thank God for what they see we can begin to even influence them, we can begin to paint a picture for them that you know what, it is important.
[time=2827] It's important that no matter what we have, each week, we're gonna do our very best with his help to bring something to him and offer it to him gladly and willingly and thankfully.
[time=2838] Moms and dads with younger ones and even the ones that are getting older, why don't you just take a few minutes on Saturday night and prepare the offering for the next day, moms and dads, adults on Saturday PM or back when the check first came, write your giving check first.
[time=2856] Write your giving check first off the top
[time=2862] and set it aside, prepare it to bring it and offer it,
[time=2868] whatever it might be, bringing it willingly.
[time=2873] As Paul says in 2 Corinthians 9, cheerfully, gratefully for Sunday giving, those of you that are paid monthly and quarterly, I understand that dilemma, I do, I mean we've talked about that enough, you and I, you know what, do your best, do your very best to somehow in the midst of that kind of a schedule, do your very best to bring a gift, no matter how much and help those around you see the value of that.
[time=2901] Second principle, write this down, the participants, the participants, or let's answer this question and it's asked often, people will ask me, Kelly, who is to give, who is it that should be a part of the regular giving process, who is it that should give?
[time=2918] Well, we see there in verse two, again, go with me back to the text, 1 Corinthians 16-2, on the first day of every week, there's the period of time,
[time=2929] each one of you, who's that?
[time=2934] That's you, that is, answer to the question,
[time=2941] each one of you that knows Him and calls this place home.
[time=2949] Each one of you is all inclusive, no Christ follower is accepted or excused, we are stewards of whatever the Lord has given us, no matter how little or how great it may be in economic terms, Mark 12 gives us a great example
[time=2970] of this, Mark 1241 paints a picture of this very, very principle, write that down in your notes, Mark 1241, you can come back and look at this more closely and he sat down, Jesus did, opposite the treasury and began observing how the people were putting money into the treasury, people were bringing their offerings and many rich people were putting in large sums of money and he sat down opposite the treasury and began observing how the people were putting money into the treasury, oh, keep going.
[time=2998] A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, rich folks were putting in a bunch, poor widow comes and puts in two small copper coins, which amounted to a cent.
[time=3015] Verse 43, calling his disciples to him, he said to them, truly, I say to you, this poor widow put in more, she put in more than all the contributors to the treasury for they all put in out of their, what, say it, they all put in out of their surplus, see, they didn't write that check.
[time=3036] When the paycheck came, they didn't write the check then.
[time=3043] They didn't do the first fruits thing.
[time=3047] No, no, no, they put off writing the check to God until they saw what they had what, left.
[time=3053] He says, that's not it.
[time=3055] That's not it.
[time=3058] Truly, I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury for they all put in out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty put in all she owned, all she had to live on.
[time=3070] He did not discourage the widow from putting in her two small copper coins.
[time=3075] Nor watched this, nor did he chastise the temple officials for accepting money from someone so destitute.
[time=3084] His reaction was to use her generosity as a model of spiritual giving.
[time=3089] Please hear this, our generosity, my friends,
[time=3095] our generosity to the Lord's work is best determined by what we give when we have nothing to give.
[time=3102] A person who is well off financially
[time=3109] can afford to give much without affecting his or her's lifestyle or well-being.
[time=3116] I am so grateful for those.
[time=3119] Well off followers of Christ, who I know,
[time=3125] though I don't know specifics, I know that their commitment to this process is such that they are always trying their best to push that level of comfort and affluence.
[time=3138] I'm so thankful for those who are well off and give sacrificially.
[time=3143] The fact of the matter is a person who is poor, however, must give up something for himself, something near and dear, oftentimes, in order to give something to others.
[time=3155] Jesus said that if we are not generous when we have little to give, we will not be generous when we have much.
[time=3162] Listen to this, not the dollar amount of our giving may increase, right?
[time=3170] But our generosity is not necessarily tied to that.
[time=3174] Don't confuse, don't think that dollar amount and generosity are always synonymous.
[time=3182] 'Cause there could be a large dollar amount given and it not be generous.
[time=3188] You and I, no matter how much we've been given are to give in a generous fashion.
[time=3196] He who is faithful, Luke six, he who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much.
[time=3203] And he who is unrighteous and a very little thing is unrighteous also in much.
[time=3213] I know families here in this room this morning, I know families who are a part of this place, who kept giving, who kept giving when there wasn't anything to give.
[time=3230] They just kept giving.
[time=3236] They just kept searching, they just kept praying, they just kept begging God for the privilege of making the contribution.
[time=3247] Bills were barely being paid, jobs had been lost, and they kept faithfully doing what they could to each week bring a gift.
[time=3258] I had a conversation recently and it's a conversation
[time=3264] I've actually had with many individuals over the years.
[time=3269] I've had individuals tell me, you know what Kelly, I've got pressing needs, okay?
[time=3277] It's always interesting to me how some people feel compelled to talk to me about their giving.
[time=3283] I don't know what you give.
[time=3285] I don't know what's going on in that arena of your life.
[time=3289] I know a lot about other arenas of your life, but we seem to not ever really talk about this arena.
[time=3294] And I understand that to a degree, but they'll come and they'll tell me I've got needs.
[time=3300] I can't give.
[time=3301] I got some things over here I gotta work out.
[time=3304] And then I'll get back in the game and then they'll oftentimes say this, besides, Kelly, you've got the big hitters carrying the load.
[time=3315] You don't need my small change.
[time=3319] I was thinking about that this week and I was thinking about
[time=3330] our driveway at home and our truck there and our family getting ready for a trip.
[time=3337] It happened recently.
[time=3340] And I don't know what your driveway and I don't know what your hallways look like when your family's getting ready to go on a trip.
[time=3346] But when our families go on a trip and the bags have been packed and all the boxes have been filled and it's time to go somewhere.
[time=3351] Man, it's like this is this is line of people and they're just coming back and forth and back and forth and duffel bags are getting thrown in and suitcases are being brought out and boxes full of toys, writing material.
[time=3365] You've been there, right?
[time=3366] I mean, it's just, it's just bedlam.
[time=3368] And I'm usually out in the truck kind of getting it all stowed away, you know, just right and or most of the time just right.
[time=3376] A few times I've been helped with that and told where this goes and that's fine.
[time=3380] It's no big deal, we get it all packed in.
[time=3381] But that's how it goes.
[time=3382] It just kids and suitcases and sleeping bags and recently I was out doing that for our Thanksgiving trip and I hear Jake.
[time=3393] And I'm inside the car there, I can't quite see where he is, I know he's close, but I hear Jake just scream.
[time=3401] He's yelling, he's ticked, he's not happy.
[time=3404] And it was either his older brother or maybe one of his older sisters had intercepted Jake on the way to the car.
[time=3414] And all I heard, I couldn't see it at first, but all I could hear was Jake just screaming mad, leave me alone, I can do it.
[time=3425] Leave me alone, he's yelling, he's four years old, I can do it.
[time=3432] So I kind of poked my head out of the back of the deal there to see here's what's going on.
[time=3442] He had his backpack and he had his little box toys.
[time=3447] He had maybe a blanket and a pillow
[time=3454] and an older sibling with a really good heart had just seen that he wasn't doing so well and was trying to help him get to the car so he could give me his stuff.
[time=3465] And he didn't want the help, not because he didn't want the help, but he wanted to make the contribution.
[time=3473] Does that make sense?
[time=3476] He wanted to be a part, it wasn't much.
[time=3481] I mean, it's not as big as his mom's suitcase, for goodness sake, it's not like it's one of his brothers or sister's big old athletic duffel bags, he knows he's not a big hitter, right?
[time=3494] But he could play a part and he's old enough now to finally realize he can play a part and he just wanted to be able to get down the walkway to the truck and hand me his bag.
[time=3507] Everybody, everybody contributes.
[time=3515] How much?
[time=3518] It's between you and God and it doesn't matter to me.
[time=3521] It's the opportunity you get to back up your bag and get your box of toys and bring it to the car and say there, boy, thank you.
[time=3530] Now I kind of feel like I'm a part and you are.
[time=3534] Amen?
[time=3535] More principles, two more big ones to look at and we'll look at those next week.
[time=3540] Let's stand as we leave this morning.
[time=3542] God, we thank you so very much for the privilege that you give us to participate, to contribute God in an amazing endeavor and we pray God that you would grow each of us, each of us in this arena.
[time=3556] God, use your word and it's truth to grow us and we'll thank you for it in your son's name we pray.
[time=3562] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3586] (upbeat music)
[time=3616] You
