[time=60] Hi, I'm Mitch Teaching Pastor at Black Hawk Ministries, where our mission is to help seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=80] And what you're about to see is a group of stories of people who have fully surrounded their lives to Christ as Savior and Lord.
[time=88] Forgiveness from the penalty of sin and freedom from the power of sin in their lives by making Christ Lord.
[time=95] And this is our baptism service, and we'd love for you to maybe grab a cup of coffee and sit back and hear these stories of how God moves in human lives.
[time=108] Thank you so much for joining us.
[time=110] Well, hey, let me invite Cindy and Chrissy. They're going to come down together. Cindy Harder and Chrissy Robinson, good friends, who want to share with you their story.
[time=121] And I'll just have you both share your stories of how you came to faith in Christ, and then we'll baptize you both.
[time=127] Come on in here. This is Cindy, and she's going to tell you a little bit about why she's here.
[time=131] Hello, my name is Cindy Harder. I am 18 years old and a sophomore math major at Ball State University.
[time=139] I split living time between my mother, Julie Harder, and my father, Troy Harder, and my stepmother, Regan Harder.
[time=146] And I have two younger sisters and two younger brothers, Geneva, Abby, Elijah, and Caleb, who are all here to support me, and I want to thank them for all their support.
[time=154] For as long as I can remember, God has been a central part of my life.
[time=159] I was raised Catholic, mostly by my mother. Although my childhood was not entirely a happy one, with many family struggles, I always knew that God was there watching over me.
[time=171] My faith only grew as I got older. Up until my senior year of high school, I was deeply devoted to the Catholic Church.
[time=178] I had never been to any other church more than once. I truly felt that it was the faith for me.
[time=185] Then my dad and stepmom started going to Black Hawk. I tended once with them and loved it right away.
[time=191] I loved the way the services were set up in the friendly atmosphere.
[time=195] I found that to my surprise, I didn't miss the Catholic Church at all.
[time=199] I still embraced some Catholic beliefs and traditions that had found a home base at Black Hawk, some place that I look forward to going to each week.
[time=207] Since I have begun attending Black Hawk, my faith has continued to grow and remain strong.
[time=213] I have used my faith to witness to others. My friend Chrissy is one of them.
[time=221] I had brought Chrissy to Catholic Mass before, but I could tell that it was not bringing her any closer to God.
[time=227] When I started coming to Black Hawk, I brought her to church with me as well.
[time=231] She loved it, and I could tell that she was finding a place here at Black Hawk.
[time=236] One night, Chrissy I am to me and told me that she had something really important to tell me. She told me that after all my pushing and prodding, she had finally decided to surrender her life to Christ.
[time=246] I was thrilled. That was about six months ago, and recently she told me that she wanted to get baptized.
[time=252] I thought that that was a great idea, so I decided that I wanted to get baptized with her as well.
[time=257] I think that baptism is an important step that every Christian should take and remember for the rest of their lives.
[time=263] I am here today to show Jesus through my baptism that I love him, and to show all of you.
[time=270] With my help, Chrissy found Christ, and with her help, I decided to get baptized.
[time=276] Good job, sweetie. Come on up here, Chrissy. Do you share with the folks what God has put on your heart?
[time=284] Hi. My name is Chrissy. I am 19 years old and currently a student at Ball State University, studying journalism education.
[time=293] I come from a rather large, blended family of 10, including two college students, two high schoolers, two middle schoolers, and two preschoolers.
[time=301] My family and I were never really church-going people. Maybe it was the churches we were going to in their politics, their people, or maybe it was just too early in the morning to get that many people ready.
[time=311] But we just never really found a church that suited us.
[time=314] My mother was always certain to keep Jesus in the home, though, and we occasionally had Bible study sessions.
[time=320] When I hit puberty, I grew away from my parents and from God.
[time=325] I wasn't a bad kid by any means. I was, in fact, the best behaved and most respected out of all my friends.
[time=331] It was just that I decided that, one, being a Christian involved too much work, and two, I was too intelligent to believe in an ultimate being.
[time=339] I lived like this for about six years, and then my junior year I started hanging out with Cindy.
[time=344] She was a Christian, so it was a really new experience for me to have a friend like that.
[time=349] She and I became really close really fast, and I found myself attending Catholic Mass with her and becoming interested in Christianity again.
[time=357] I would frequently ask her questions, and I saw her as a guiding force.
[time=361] My senior year I became bogged down, as most seniors do, as I was the editor-in-chief of our yearbook, and I would spend long hours at school stressed out because of deadlines and an unproductive staff.
[time=374] I had to quit everything that did not have anything to do with yearbook, including marching and jazz band.
[time=380] I started spending less time on my other classes, and I just focused on yearbook.
[time=384] I was losing touch with almost all my friends. The real way I became, though, when I realized I didn't have enough money to go to college.
[time=391] My parents had expected me to come up with everything myself, and I had not made any preparations independent from them.
[time=398] I realized I would not be able to go to school following my graduation, so I sunk into a deep depression.
[time=404] That's when things hit rock bottom. I was unhappy with my stage of life, and I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[time=410] With this unhappiness came of bitterness towards everybody, especially God. I did not see how I deserved this from him.
[time=417] The one person who stuck through me out all of this was Cindy. She was always there telling me that God did not hate me.
[time=426] She told me that I should come to him at this point, leaving everything up to him. She always said, "Put it in God's hands."
[time=434] Well, it was hard for me, but I did. I started going to church with her again, not to mask, but to Black Hawk. The church for her father went to.
[time=442] I wasn't used to church, but this was doable for me. The pastor said some good things, and it really made me think.
[time=449] So, while I was on break at work, sitting in my car, I asked God to take me as his own. I surrendered to him, and after my 15 minutes was up, I went back to the daily grind, but with a new sense of ease.
[time=461] Now that I'm with him, I find it easier to go through life. He gave me strength that I didn't have, and helped me get motivated to help myself.
[time=469] He sent me Cindy to lead the way. I'm here today to confess with my mouth what's already in my heart.
[time=483] That's good to hear once you come this way. Actually, let me pray for you guys first. They will do this. I'm so excited. I don't know what I'm doing.
[time=494] I want you to bow your heads, and I hope as you bow your heads, I hope every one of you in this room is reminded from these stories that you've heard.
[time=504] That number one, it is so very important that you know him, and surrender every part of your life to him. And number two, that you would be willing each and every one of you to share that with someone else.
[time=519] That you would be willing to be one who builds redemptive friendships. That you would have a mind and a heart that seeks to do your part in passing along this life-changing truth.
[time=531] Father God, we're thankful for these two. They're friendship and their love for you, and we pray God, you'd strengthen them in the days to come, to live out their faith fully and completely.
[time=542] Whatever that might cost them, wherever that might lead them. God, I pray you'd strengthen them for that.
[time=547] Thank you for your grace and mercy, God, your unending love that drew them to yourself.
[time=552] And we pray, God, that we could, as a family, come alongside and encourage them, and equipping them to be the women, God, that you've called them to be.
[time=562] In your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=564] All right, Chris, you can stand over there.
[time=566] Cindy, why don't you hold on here before with hands? It's my privilege and a real honor.
[time=571] It's your pastor and your friend to baptize you this morning in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=583] Good job. I'll get some of your glasses for you.
[time=585] There you go.
[time=588] All right, Chris, come over here. You can hang on here with both hands.
[time=593] It is a joy and privilege. Thank you so much for sharing your story, and it was a great honor for me.
[time=601] As your pastor and friend to baptize you this morning in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=610] Good job.
[time=612] Nice job.
[time=614] Man, how special. Let me invite you to, let me invite Nick Harder to come in here. I want you to meet Nick.
[time=623] I'm so thankful that he's here, and I'm so grateful that he wants to come and share with you his story on how he came to faith in Christ.
[time=631] Nick, share with the folks how it is that he led you to this point, and then we'll baptize you.
[time=638] Hi, my name is Nick. I'm 24, a junior at IPFW, recently married, a son, a brother, and a father.
[time=646] After I graduated high school in 1998, I got into some drugs, failed out of my first few semesters at IPFW, and generally was heading on a downward spiral.
[time=655] About a year and a half ago, I came to Common Ground to hear my Uncle Troy give his testimony.
[time=660] It really touched me, so I joined my wife in coming here to Blackhawk.
[time=664] I attended AA meetings before Common Ground to help me stay sober.
[time=668] Before I got married, my wife and I had a meeting with Pastor Cruz. He talked to me about full surrender.
[time=674] I told him, "I believed, but I thought that I was too sinful to surrender." He told me, "The great thing about fully surrendering your life to Christ is that you don't have to be perfect to start your journey."
[time=684] Right then and there, I surrendered. It was about six months ago, and I've been sober for over a year.
[time=689] The more I learn about the gospel and worship our Lord and Savior, the less I have distress over the outcomes of situations in my life.
[time=696] I know that he is in control and that with him, anything can be accomplished.
[time=701] Let me ask you to bow your heads if you would close your eyes. Let's pray for Nick.
[time=716] Father, we come before you so very grateful for this young man, for his family.
[time=723] God, we have seen you at work through Troy and through the circumstances, God, that you worked in his life and now to see Nick and others.
[time=736] As they have watched and as they have seen you transform and change God to stand here in these waters today with Nick.
[time=745] And to realize that he has completely and fully given his heart and life to you.
[time=750] It is with great joy that we do this. It is with great gratitude that we stand here, amazed again at your grace.
[time=759] And so very thankful that you allow us to be a part of your life-changing work.
[time=764] We pray, God, that you would continue to strengthen Nick.
[time=768] We pray, God, that his appetites and affections would continue to be focused completely on you.
[time=777] We pray that you would continue as you have in recent months to give him perspective and strength.
[time=783] To say no to the offerings of the evil one and to say yes to you and that which you have led him toward.
[time=791] Thank you Father for saving him and thank you for the chance to celebrate that now in your son's name. We pray. Amen. Amen.
[time=800] Well, Nick, it is a real joy and honor as your pastor and your friend to be here with you today to baptize you.
[time=808] The presence of God and in front of your family here at Blackhawk in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=816] [APPLAUSE]
[time=834] Let me begin by having my good friend Jorge Tobo come into the water with me and he brings with him two wonderful people, two special friends.
[time=842] Ivan and Romi Gomara and Ivan and Romi are coming to share their story of how they came to faith and to allow them to do that in their own tongue.
[time=854] In a language that they're going to feel a little bit more comfortable with as far as sharing with you in this setting.
[time=860] Jorge has agreed to come and translate for you. We are so thankful for the Spanish ministry that God has given us.
[time=866] So thankful for those who work so faithfully in that arena and what a joy it is to see him at work in their lives.
[time=873] So Romi and Ivan come and share with us how you came to know Christ and Jorge is going to help out.
[time=879] Hi. You're so Romi Ritchie.
[time=885] My name is Romi Ritchie.
[time=887] Nancy and Pedro.
[time=888] I was born in Peru.
[time=895] My hobby is reading.
[time=901] I used to work in a bank.
[time=907] Everything has to do with the public.
[time=911] I had so many goals like learning English.
[time=916] My idea is to be able to speak in Spanish.
[time=920] It would allow me to study English. It would allow me to find better jobs.
[time=927] I have a better schedule. It would allow me a better time frame to work and to be around my home.
[time=939] As a child, I always had doubts.
[time=944] In questions about God?
[time=947] My first question came up.
[time=955] Well, I was on a trip for vacation.
[time=960] I was 12 years of age.
[time=963] When a couple came and approached me and talked to me about Christ
[time=973] in a very different way.
[time=981] And from this, this talking with this couple generated a bunch of questions
[time=987] which I ended up asking the nuns.
[time=992] But the answers never satisfied me.
[time=997] When a couple came and asked me to work, I was supposed to work with the statues.
[time=1006] They used to tell me that that was just a symbol.
[time=1011] I used to see how people used to work with figures or symbols.
[time=1019] I couldn't even pray if I had a statue or something.
[time=1026] A statue or a figure in front of me.
[time=1030] In my youth, I always feared God, but also I became rebellious.
[time=1041] I made so many mistakes.
[time=1046] And in consequence, I became a single mother.
[time=1055] But this made me reflect.
[time=1063] And I started to obey more of my father.
[time=1068] Even though he wasn't agree with me.
[time=1075] I stay away from the people that I didn't need to stay with him.
[time=1082] And I dedicate myself to my daughter.
[time=1088] But always I used to pray to God.
[time=1094] Then I met my husband Ivan.
[time=1101] We got in love and we married eight months later.
[time=1108] We had a family of four children.
[time=1111] Marientula, Furella, Piedo, Gianfranco.
[time=1116] In this 21 years we had so many problems.
[time=1122] We had so many problems.
[time=1129] These separated us more and we were more concentrated in our jobs and we have time for our children.
[time=1135] In this 21 years we had so many problems.
[time=1140] This time more than twice we were invited to a Christian church.
[time=1146] We went a couple of times but there was so much pressure from the family and the place wasn't closed that we ended up not going anymore.
[time=1158] And our problems continue to grow.
[time=1162] Then we had the opportunity to come to the United States.
[time=1170] Our problems have already separated us enough.
[time=1180] We live in Los Angeles and then Arizona.
[time=1185] And then in Arizona another person talked to us again about God.
[time=1191] I was feeling that I was already in God's plan because my heart was willing to listen.
[time=1205] I had so much resentment with my husband.
[time=1212] For our previous mistakes.
[time=1217] But I learned from God that we have to forgive one another.
[time=1225] And forgive from heart.
[time=1229] And I remember it anymore.
[time=1234] And start a new life.
[time=1239] It was so much the pressure of my family.
[time=1245] But I was able to come out.
[time=1249] When we have the opportunity from Arizona, somebody from the actual talk to us about when we were coming to Fort Wayne, somebody mentioned to us Black Hawk and the opportunity that we will have here.
[time=1274] And when we told us that there was no Spanish service, so we feel like we were going to be locked out.
[time=1300] But there was somebody that was so kindly we asked here at the church, he talked to us about the Tobo family.
[time=1307] And by coincidence, Lily Tobo was one of the persons that worked at the school where my son used to go at elementary school.
[time=1323] But the only person who worked at the church was the person who worked at the church.
[time=1336] And with him and with other couples, his youth and his wife Pilar, we've been able to study more about the Bible.
[time=1344] When I learned something different and I've been able to start a relationship with God.
[time=1366] It was different and it's different to have a relationship with God.
[time=1371] But indeed, it's almost, it's almost like that we are safe by grace through Christ by faith.
[time=1385] I want my children, my family to come to know Christ and I know that that is not up to me.
[time=1407] It is in God's hands and all I have to do is continue to pray for them.
[time=1413] I have decided to follow Christ.
[time=1417] And I want obedience to him, I want to baptize him.
[time=1424] I want to be baptized, excuse me.
[time=1429] And I want to continue because I have been born again with God.
[time=1443] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1452] Hi, my name is Ivan.
[time=1454] I was born in Lima, Peru.
[time=1456] We are seven people in my family, my wife Rami.
[time=1460] We have two daughters, Marie Angela, Firella and two sons, Piero and Jan Franco.
[time=1466] And the youngest member of the family is my granddaughter, Karina.
[time=1470] I was raised in a Catholic family and went to Catholic school.
[time=1475] And after that, I attended two and a half years to university.
[time=1479] My colleagues are listening to music and watch soccer games on TV.
[time=1484] I used to play it but not anymore.
[time=1487] When I was 19 years old, I started to work in a bank and I got the branch manager position.
[time=1495] After a few years, I quit and started my own business in restaurant concession and catering.
[time=1501] It was going good, but after some years, it was turning hard to live in Peru or country.
[time=1508] And then we decided to move to the United States.
[time=1512] We've been four and a half years living in the U.S.
[time=1515] First in Los Angeles, California.
[time=1517] Then in Scottsdale, Arizona.
[time=1519] And now here in Fort Wayne, working at the Fort Wayne Foundry.
[time=1523] It was in Lima when I started to go to a Christian church.
[time=1529] And it made me feel good.
[time=1531] It was a new sensation.
[time=1533] It was a new feeling.
[time=1535] I remember it was exciting, something different.
[time=1539] Then in Scottsdale, a friend invited us to attend to Scottsdale Community Church.
[time=1545] And I started to be more interested in God and at the same time, I started to change my own way.
[time=1552] When our friend knew that we were moving to Fort Wayne, she gave us Black Hawk address, phone number and the pastor's name.
[time=1562] So after some days living in Fort Wayne, we look for Black Hawk Ministries and here we are.
[time=1569] I can tell you that since I'm coming Black Hawk, I change.
[time=1577] Now I feel myself closer to our Lord and I can feel Him beside me every time.
[time=1585] When I pray or during the worship, I feel myself excited.
[time=1590] It's something great, huge.
[time=1593] Now I'm pretty sure that I'm fully surrounded with Him.
[time=1597] That's why I will be baptized today because my faith, because I am 100% sure He's my Savior.
[time=1605] And I want to be every time serving and closer to Him.
[time=1609] [AMEN]
[time=1610] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1623] [AMEN] Wow.
[time=1625] A couple things to remember there as you reflect on these stories.
[time=1630] Number one, you want to just thank God for whoever it was that faithfully answered the call to Lima, Peru.
[time=1638] There was a Christian church there.
[time=1641] [AMEN] Somebody there giving their life and their energy to the gospel.
[time=1648] And here, years later, we find two and a family whose lives have been changed and whose eternities have been altered.
[time=1656] And it began there.
[time=1658] And thank you for being a church that is so given to.
[time=1663] And so excited about the privilege He's given us here to care for seekers everywhere.
[time=1672] And, you know, red, yellow, black, and white.
[time=1676] We're used to seeing His kids, right?
[time=1678] They are precious and His what?
[time=1680] In His sight.
[time=1682] And so we have the privilege of being a part of ministry here in Fort Wayne to everybody.
[time=1687] And I'm so thankful for Jorge.
[time=1689] So thankful for Jesus and Pilar Escobedo.
[time=1692] And so thankful for those who serve faithfully in that ministry.
[time=1697] And I want to just pray if we can, Jorge.
[time=1700] Romi Yvonne, come here.
[time=1702] Let me pray for you guys.
[time=1703] And then we'll baptize you.
[time=1704] Father, thank you so much.
[time=1705] [SPEAKING FRENCH] For this family.
[time=1708] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Thank you for the love and grace and mercy you have shown them.
[time=1712] [SPEAKING FRENCH] And we pray God you would continue to grow them.
[time=1717] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] And their relationship with you.
[time=1722] [SPEAKING FRENCH] And then their ministry here at Black Hawk.
[time=1725] [SPEAKING FRENCH] And we'll thank you for it.
[time=1728] [SPEAKING FRENCH] In your son's name, amen.
[time=1730] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [AMEN] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Well, Romi, we'll start with you.
[time=1735] Yvonne, you want to come stand over here?
[time=1737] And Romi, why don't you turn around this way?
[time=1740] There, right there we go.
[time=1741] And hold on to my hand.
[time=1743] There you go.
[time=1746] Romi, it is my privilege and my pleasure to baptize you today, here before God and this family.
[time=1753] In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1757] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1760] [AMEN]
[time=1761] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1762] Thank you.
[time=1763] [APPLAUSE - 1 seconds]
[time=1777] All right, me, Amigo.
[time=1778] All right.
[time=1781] I'll hold you.
[time=1782] There's my privilege.
[time=1784] As your friend and pastor, to baptize you today in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1791] [APPLAUSE - 5 seconds]
[time=1800] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=1815] Wow.
[time=1816] What a morning already, huh?
[time=1818] Hope you've been encouraged.
[time=1820] Hope you've been reminded why it is we are so given and so committed in our hearts to this ministry that he's given us.
[time=1829] There isn't anything like it in the world.
[time=1831] And when you get to hear those stories and when you get to see real lives changed forever, it is just a wonderful, wonderful reminder.
[time=1842] Well, I'm glad you're back this morning.
[time=1844] We want to just take some time here in the remaining time that we have.
[time=1849] I want to take some time and finish up what we started last week.
[time=1854] If you were here last week, you know that we have been so very blessed by God to have so many that call Black Hawk home these days, and especially so many that are new in their faith.
[time=1869] Some still even thinking it through.
[time=1872] Some still even here in the process of trying to understand better what it means to even know the Lord.
[time=1878] Others of you very new in your walk and journey, just beginning to understand.
[time=1884] You may have committed your life to him in the last few months in the last year or so.
[time=1889] There are many of you who have known him and been walking with him for years, and your understanding of biblical giving, your understanding of New Testament giving, the way in which we are to handle our finances, our stewardship as it relates to the gifts that we bring.
[time=1907] Many of you understand that. You've been taught that.
[time=1910] You've applied those truths to your life.
[time=1912] Others of you are still trying to figure out how exactly to do that, and so we have just taken a couple of weeks here to give some thought and some attention to what God's Word has to say.
[time=1924] If you were here last week, you know that we went in our text, the first Corinthians 16, and I want to invite you this morning to go back to that same text, 1 Corinthians 16 verses 1 to 4, and we will review briefly and then move on to some concluding thoughts on this issue of New Testament giving, fully surrendered giving.
[time=1944] In honor of God's Word, would you stand with me this morning as we read from Paul's first letter to the church at Corinth, 1 Corinthians 16 verses 1 through 4.
[time=1957] It says there, "Now concerning the collection for the saints, "as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also.
[time=1965] "On the first day of every week, each one of you "is to put aside and save as he may prosper, "so that no collections be made when I come.
[time=1977] "When I arrive, whomever you may approve, "I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
[time=1983] "And if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me." Let's pray.
[time=1989] Father, God, we stand before you this morning asking you to do please what you so often do with your Word and your Spirit.
[time=1999] God, that our hearts and lives would be penetrated.
[time=2003] God, that faulty thinking would be exposed.
[time=2006] God, that fears would be relieved.
[time=2009] God, that our willingness to give, not to individuals or institutions, primarily God as far as our perspective, but God, our willingness to give to you, our willingness to, with grateful hearts, to give back to you, that which you have so willingly and faithfully provided us.
[time=2028] God, as we desire to do that, allow your Scripture here today to give us a framework, to give us direction and guidance as to how that process should work.
[time=2039] God, what it should look like in each of our lives, and we'll thank you for it in your Son's name.
[time=2043] We pray.
[time=2044] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=2048] Well, we began our look at giving last week by kind of asking some questions.
[time=2055] Number one was the purpose of giving.
[time=2057] What's it all about?
[time=2059] The purpose of giving.
[time=2061] And when we looked at the purpose of giving, we saw right here in the text.
[time=2065] God's Word is so very clear here in 1 Corinthians 16, and in other places as well.
[time=2071] We went to 2 Corinthians 8.
[time=2074] We went to Romans 15, and we saw in those passages as well as many others that the text of Scripture is so very clear that primarily the giving done by Christ followers in the local church is for the saints.
[time=2092] It says it again and again and again.
[time=2094] Giving is for the church, for the ministry of the body of Christ, the ministry to the body of Christ, the body of Christ.
[time=2104] Your gifts and mine on a regular basis are for the purpose of furthering God's chosen institution.
[time=2113] The chosen vessel.
[time=2115] The vessel of ministry that primarily he has set apart to carry the life-changing gospel message of Jesus Christ.
[time=2125] Your gifts and mine are primarily for the church.
[time=2130] We saw secondly that there are some principles, some principles that come with any biblical look at this topic as you begin to kind of unfold what Scripture teaches, we find that there are some principles for giving that would be very, very helpful for you and I.
[time=2147] Four principles to guide you and I in our God-honoring worshipful giving.
[time=2152] And last week we were able to jump into I think the first two of these.
[time=2156] So just by way of review, we visit where we went as it relates to these four principles of giving.
[time=2163] Still in our text, still in 1 Corinthians 16, the first principle we see begins here in verse two, and it has to do with the period of giving, or it answers the question when we are to give.
[time=2176] The answer was weekly.
[time=2178] On a regular basis, on the first day of every week,
[time=2184] you see it there in 1 Corinthians 16-2, on the first day of every week, each one of you is to put aside and save.
[time=2195] Weekly was the answer to that question.
[time=2198] We talked about how you might not only benefit from just thinking that through yourself, we talked about how it would be important for you to also help your children with that notion, to help them begin to, on Saturday evening or Saturday night, to put aside their regular gift, their regular offering, their weekly gift that they are wanting to bring to God.
[time=2221] We talked about how some of you are paid monthly.
[time=2224] Others of you paid every other week, some paid quarterly.
[time=2227] We understand that.
[time=2228] This was not in God's effort here as he works through Paul, as Paul writes 1 Corinthians 16.
[time=2236] This was not God's intent, nor is it ours, to set up some kind of legalistic new mandate that now everybody who ever walks through those doors has got to have that envelope ready.
[time=2247] You have got to do this or you're out.
[time=2249] No, that wasn't the heart at all.
[time=2251] It's not the intent of this Scripture, the intent of this Scripture, and the intent of us teaching it to you here today is to remind you of what a privilege it is on a regular basis to give.
[time=2264] And whether you're paid quarterly, weekly, monthly, probably each one of us could, if we manage that well key phrase,
[time=2275] be able to come with some kind of gift on a regular basis
[time=2281] that allows us then to, in the giving of that gift, that worshipful gift, it allows that gift giving to be a part of the regular worship.
[time=2291] The participants, this was the second point we came to, the participants, or who is to give.
[time=2298] We answered the question, who is to give?
[time=2301] If you'll remember, I ended last week with that story about my boy Jake as he got ready for our last vacation.
[time=2308] Remember, Jake, Jake wanted to take his suitcase, Jake wanted to take his pillow, Jake wanted to take his little box of riding utensils that Jake wanted to take that from his room all the way out to the driveway, and he wanted to give that to me so I could put it in where it belonged. He didn't want any help.
[time=2326] Remember? His gift wasn't as big. His bag wasn't as big as his brothers,
[time=2334] but it didn't matter. He wanted the privilege of participating.
[time=2341] He wanted to be a part of the family, and in his mind, he felt like that meant he had to drag that bag down the walkway across the driveway and give it.
[time=2351] And it was a reminder to you and I that in the text, 1 Corinthians 16 2 says, you can look right there for yourself, on the first day of every week, each one of you is to put aside and save.
[time=2367] Each one of you is to give. Everybody has the privilege of participating
[time=2373] in the collection for the saints.
[time=2377] Thirdly, now we come to our third point, and we didn't make it this far last week.
[time=2382] Write this down, if you will, if you're taking notes or continuing on with your notes, the place we've seen the period or when we've seen the participants or who, now the place of giving, where are we to give?
[time=2394] Just as giving is primarily for the church, it is also, biblically speaking,
[time=2401] primarily to take place at and through the church.
[time=2406] That our regular giving is to be a part of the weekly worship service, the weekly gathering of those who have come to worship him and whatever local fellowship that our giving is to be a part of that gathering seems clear from the text again,
[time=2423] where it states on the first day of the week.
[time=2427] You see in the New Testament church, the regular day for worship was Sunday,
[time=2433] the first day of the week.
[time=2435] Now much of the early preaching and much of the early evangelism was toward Jews
[time=2441] and done by converted Jews and therefore was done on Saturday, the Sabbath.
[time=2446] You can read about that in Acts 13 and in Acts 17.
[time=2451] The first post-resurrection service, if you will, was held on Easter evening
[time=2457] when the risen Lord appeared to his frightened and disheartened disciples.
[time=2462] It says there in John 20, "When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week." And when the doors were shut, where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, "Peace be with you." The disciples therefore rejoiced, it says, when they saw him.
[time=2483] His next appearance, Jesus' next appearance was eight days later and therefore on another Sunday when Thomas was with them.
[time=2491] Now consequently, though many Jewish believers continued to worship in the synagogue and in the temple on the Sabbath, the normal time for Christians to worship together as Christ followers came to be in time Sunday.
[time=2506] The disciples noted there in Acts 20, verse 7.
[time=2510] The Sabbath was eventually set aside in favor of resurrection day.
[time=2514] And by the time John wrote the book of Revelation, in the last decade of the first century, the first day of the week was referred to as the Lord's Day.
[time=2526] When are you to give?
[time=2530] Each week on a regular basis, God's Word says, who is to participate in the giving?
[time=2538] Everybody, everybody that knows him, everybody that would have so much to be grateful for, everybody who is a part of that family, each and every one of us is to bring the gift.
[time=2550] Where? At the church with the family as you bring the gift with the body gathered.
[time=2558] Now somebody, not somebody, several have in conversation with me over the years. We've even talked about this as a staff, as a leadership. I've often heard people say to me, you know, Kelly, I really, really enjoy that whole automatic withdrawal at the bank. They just take my tithe and boom, it's gone.
[time=2578] I don't even have to think about it.
[time=2582] And I want you to know, I'm not going to stand here and make some, however you do that, again, this whole arena, it's up to you.
[time=2594] I just want to make sure you understand. I want one person said to me, you know, it's just so convenient.
[time=2602] Believe me, I am one for convenience. I love convenience.
[time=2606] Wherever I can find that or have that in my life, I just want you to be careful.
[time=2610] I don't know that everything has to be convenient.
[time=2614] And there may be some benefit to you thinking through the ringing of the gift.
[time=2622] The preparing of the gift.
[time=2626] The thinking about the gift, and most importantly, the remembering the gift.
[time=2634] Something to consider as you think through these principles.
[time=2638] Next principle, write this down. The proportion.
[time=2642] A question that is so very much on the minds of so many people. How much do I give?
[time=2650] How much should I give? People ask it all the time.
[time=2654] Paul's exhortation here in our text, here in 1 Corinthians 16, Paul's exhortation is completely discretionary for a Christian to give as, see the text, as he may prosper.
[time=2670] There is a great difference of opinion among Christians as to how much of our income should be given to the Lord's work.
[time=2678] A common traditional answer to the question, how much should you give has been what? Say it louder.
[time=2686] Ten percent. People have often talked about. People have often taught about. You have often heard discussions about the tithe.
[time=2694] A willingness on your part of mind to give ten percent to God.
[time=2698] Well, the problem is, and not that that's a problem, that may very be where he leads you. But the misconception is that somehow, some way, that's kind of the New Testament church standard, and it's not. It's based on a misconception of the nature and purpose of the Old Testament tie. Listen, I hope this is interesting. I hope this is educational. I really want you to just kind of hear me go through this so you have a working understanding of how it is you're supposed to figure out what it is, what proportion, what amount you are to bring. The practice of giving a tithe was common in many ancient cultures. Abraham gave a tithe of his possessions to Melchizedek who was a priest of God most high. You read that in Genesis 14. Jacob promised to give a tenth of all he had if God would protect and prosper him. You read that story of Jacob's encounter with God in Genesis 28. But in neither case did God require such a percentage.
[time=2762] This was not something God demanded. This was not something God commanded.
[time=2766] Both Abraham and Jacob's offerings were entirely voluntary and apparently singular in nature. They happened those one times. There is no indication from Scripture that any of God's people gave 10% on a regular basis before the time of Moses. The only giving amount specifically prescribed by God in the book of Genesis pertained to the famine in Egypt where you see God through Joseph encouraging the folks to set aside a fifth which would have been 20% of their grain and produce but this was because of the famine that was coming. They were to take that gift that 20% and put it all aside so they would have food to eat in the years that would follow. That amount however though prescribed by God was not a spiritual or religious offering but was a form of governmental welfare to be used for the people's own good during the coming time of need. In the Mosaic law 10% is prescribed for the first time by God. You can find this in Leviticus 27 verse 30 says there, "Thus all the tithe of the land of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the towards. It is holy to the Lord." That tithe was to the sons of Levi for an inheritance in return for their service which they performed the service of the tent of meetings. You see the Levites were the ones who were the priests, the Levites were the ones who stood there in the gap between God and the people.
[time=2862] The Levites were the ones who served and ministered to the people of Israel and God and his desire to honor them calls the folks to bring a tenth.
[time=2870] And then the Levites were in turn to give a tithe from that.
[time=2874] So it was the tithe of the tithe. The tithes, burn offerings, sacrifices, contributions, free will offerings, and the first born of animals mentioned in Deuteronomy 14 were a second 10% to be used to support the national feasts and holidays. Each third year another 10% was to be given for use in supporting the Levite, the alien, the orphan, and the widow.
[time=2902] And as you study the theocracy of Israel as you study those texts dealing with Israel and its theocracy and its giving it becomes evident that the amount paid annually was somewhere in the 23% range and that it essentially was a tax used for the operation of Israel's government. It never involved a free will spontaneous giving to the Lord.
[time=2930] Now watch this. There is in the Old Testament though a basic principle stated as it relates to voluntary giving and you find that reflected in Proverbs 3, 9, and 10 where it says honor as it relates to voluntary giving. Now you and I can apply this. Honor the Lord it says from your wealth. Whatever it is you've received.
[time=2954] Honor the Lord from your wealth and from the first of all your produce so your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will overflow with new wine. Key there is from the first of all your produce. Last week we saw the widow in Mark 12 Jesus commended, Jesus celebrated her giving heart as she gave back to him all that she had He noted that her gift was extraordinary because she had given sacrificially while others in the synagogue that day had given out of their what? Surplus that would not be God honoring giving.
[time=2998] You or I waiting till the end to see what is and there's no other way to say it to see what is left over to see what crumbs or scraps you and I might want to push his way.
[time=3014] The basic principle for voluntary giving in the Old Testament is a powerful picture of sacrifice.
[time=3022] Proverbs 11 says there is one who scatters yet increases all the more and there is one who withholds what is justly due but it results only in want.
[time=3034] In other words if you want to increase your money God's word it says share it generously. If you want to lose your money keep it, hoard it.
[time=3046] Now this picture of voluntary giving we do see it in other places in the Old Testament to raise money to build the tabernacle the Lord told Moses and you find this in Exodus 25 verses 1 and 2. He said tell the sons of Israel to raise a contribution for me from every man who's what? Say it out loud.
[time=3066] From every man who's heart moves him you shall raise my contribution. Standard was heart directed generosity.
[time=3078] That's what he's after. Heart directed generosity based on thankfulness to the Lord for what he had done and given based on that principle the gifts for the building of the tabernacle were so great check it out you can write this down. Exodus 36 the giving was so great the people responded overwhelmingly from their heart so grateful for what God had done so thankful for how faithful he'd been that they give so much that he has to go to the people and tell them to stop giving no more gifts he says there's too much required giving was taxation free will giving was to be from the heart it's clear with the amount left up to the worshipper David had the idea straight in 2 Samuel 24 when he said he would not give God that which cost him nothing now I got to say something to you here just real quick I have tried very hard in the last couple of weeks now to honor you and to be sensitive to this issue and whatever situation in life you may currently find yourself in I've tried to be sensitive to that and I've attempted to be sensitive by saying things like this I've said to you several times when we've referenced your gift I've said whatever that might be whatever that might be whether that's a little or a lot right you've heard me say that well I want to make sure that we understand something about that statement because I know watch this I know me and I have sat there and I have heard this and when someone has stood here and said to me hey whatever that might be and I'm sitting there not managing my money well spending more than I make making foolish decisions with my finances up to my ears in debt see I know that sometimes when we sit here and we hear hey whatever that whatever that can be and we're living financially spiritually in disobedience then this little tiny amount that we're actually able to give we go so if that's all that goes long as he's saying whatever that might be and I know for me that not very much because my financial world's a mess see we've missed something there whatever that might be that's assuming that you and I are doing a really really god honoring job of managing our funds and our resources in a way that not only honors him but allows us to have something significant to give there's a ministry here that we offer a wonderful 12 week course called Crown and Crown is a great great opportunity for any of you to gain insight and encouragement and accountability as it relates to the way you steward the gifts that God has given you it's about financial stewardship it's also about life stewardship and I would really encourage you to ask some folks at the guest center or look in your bulletins there may even be some I think currently or in the not too distant future there may be a chance for you to jump in and join one of those crown groups I would highly highly recommend it my word to you hear this morning is this don't don't rob him don't don't do that don't rob god by being unfaithful as a steward of that which he has given you and remember Jake everybody everybody gets to participate and when you do and when you're willing to do it that way he promises that he will bless that effort if you need hopefully some of this as we've gone through it hopefully some of this has helped clear some things up for you you know what if it hasn't if you've still got some questions ask them we would love to do our best to give you some further guidance and encouragement as it relates to giving I believe in the bullet in this morning there were some commonly asked questions again please don't be thrown by that first one that was a joke somebody last week or somebody a few weeks ago had asked me that somebody who really was not aware of how we did it the question was real and who knows what other questions are out there but we've provided you that sheet to just kind of give you an opportunity to think through and look through this issue as it relates to some of the questions that oftentimes are asked so you know me I'm pretty much excited about most things I am really looking forward my friends to first Peter we are going to study this great book this letter from Peter we're going to study this thing kind of just front to front to back verse by verse and as I've been reading it and as we've been preparing for it I can't tell you how thankful I am for the opportunity to study this life changing text with you it is an amazing story of a people a first century you know band of Christ followers who were absolutely being persecuted and tortured and killed and kidnapped and beaten for their faith these were the days of Nero and it was not good and you can sit here today and go wow that's amazing it will be interesting to read and study about that Kelly but we're not living with Nero today well you know what I would disagree with that Nero's dead but the enemy my friends isn't and he is bringing to you and he is bringing to me on a regular basis a battle and a fight like none other the things that you and I face today the temptations and opportunities that are out there they wage war against the Christ follower and you and I need to know how to respond and Peter paints a picture of a response to life in this world that is absolutely powerful he talks about a response of love and he talks about a response of hope and he talks about a response of holiness and I just pray and hope that you'll be here and join us take a look here at the promo for it and be praying about and thinking about what it will be like for you and I to study this great book when holiness meets hostility
[time=3510] things we do how can we sing when there seems no reason to how do we smile when there's not much to smile about when the world is down
[time=3528] who are we to stand and shout they wonder why you do the things we do
[time=3562] you
