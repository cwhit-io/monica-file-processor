[time=30] (dramatic music)
[time=60] (dramatic music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird,
[time=89] Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and it is great to be with you again.
[time=93] I am so thankful for the opportunity we have this week to share with you something that we really, really are thankful for, actually it's someone, and it's Dr. Al Jennings from Summit Church International here in Fort Wayne, and I am so grateful for his friendship and so very thankful that he was willing again to come and minister to us here at Black Hawk this past week.
[time=118] I am grateful for his friendship, and I am so thankful for what he models, not only for me, but for those in this city, so thankful for the ministry that God has given him, and I ask Al if he would come today and just share with you a few things, I want him to share with you a little bit more about his church, that wonderful family, down there at Summit and the things that God is doing there, and also I ask him if he would just give you a little preview on the message that he brought to our family this past week, the message that you're about to see right here.
[time=152] So my good friend, it's good to be with you.
[time=156] Thank you for your friendship, and share with the folks, a little bit about your church and about the message that you brought this past week.
[time=164] - Sure, I'd be glad to.
[time=165] First of all, I'd like to say, Kelly, I really appreciate likewise our friendship, and it means a lot to me, and we've got Sweet Communion and Fellowship between one another, and our families, and it's a blessing to my wife, children, and it's really special.
[time=182] And it was also an honor to minister to your great congregation this past Sunday, and it was really awesome, and we enjoyed ourselves.
[time=193] A little bit about our ministry, our ministry is Summit Ministries International, our local church is Summit Church, which is a division of Summit Ministries International, and our vision is to teach people how to win in life through the Word of God, and touching others with the touch we receive from God.
[time=218] My passion is to help believers to discover their destiny in God, and actually not just believers, but also people who are seeking, and seeking for something, unbelievers, but people who need to come into a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=240] We wanna reach them, and we have a variety of different ways that we do that.
[time=244] One aspect of our ministry is what we call our touch groups, which are small group ministry that we have, that small groups which meet throughout the city, and we raise up leaders among the congregation who are trained to go out and minister and evangelize to people who are seeking.
[time=268] And also our leaders are trained to minister to the congregation, so we have that one another ministry to build up the body.
[time=277] But I'm passionate about teaching people how to take the Word of God and apply it to their life so that they can become successful and prosperous in every area of their life, spiritually, mentally, physically, financially, and socially.
[time=296] And a little bit about what you're about to hear today comes out of my desire and passion to help people
[time=306] to discover what God has put them on this earth to do.
[time=313] You may be wondering today, what am I on this earth for?
[time=318] Is it just a punch of clock at work, come home and watch TV?
[time=322] It must be more to this life.
[time=325] What am I here to do?
[time=328] I believe God has put me on this earth for a reason, and I agree with that.
[time=333] And God, through His Word, has shown us
[time=340] that He has calling something for you to do.
[time=345] He's got a purpose for your being here.
[time=351] Psalm 139 tells us that He has, before we ever had days, He planned beforehand, a good life for us.
[time=363] And even before, before we got here, He prepared a life for us, and so we're to walk in that life that He has prepared for us.
[time=375] And so that's a little bit about what we're gonna talk about today.
[time=378] Amen, amen.
[time=379] And I am so very grateful that not only God has given me Al and Miss Carla and his family as friends, I'm so thankful that in the same light, He has given our family here at Blackhawk, this friendship and the opportunity to be ministered to and loved by this man.
[time=401] So again, thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=404] We're so grateful for what we get to share with you week in and week out.
[time=408] Continue to let us hear from you.
[time=410] Shoot us an email and let us know what's happening in your life, how we're able to minister to you.
[time=417] Things that you see God doing that we can celebrate with you and know how grateful we are for the chance to help seeking people, find and follow God bless you.

[time=632] (Music)
[time=660] (Applause) Wow, you are in for such a blessing.
[time=671] My second oldest daughter Kelsey is 10, and she was invited to a friend's house last night
[time=678] and to go to church with her then this morning.
[time=682] Kelsey normally is, "Boom, yeah, I'm going! Can I go dead? I'm going!" And except this time, Kelsey almost gave a little tear in her eye and a quiver and a voice and she said, "I don't know if I want to go. I go Kelsey, what's wrong with you?" She said, "I don't want to miss Al Jennings."
[time=703] I said, "Oh." And so I'm kind of thinking about, I said, "Well Kelsey, are you that excited to hear me preach?"
[time=710] And that's where mom pipes in, and her mom says, "Oh, Mitchell, you know, and I can finish the sentence for you know,
[time=716] you're our favorite preacher." And Susan says, "Oh, Mitchell, you know how Jennings is really dynamic."
[time=725] And I got to think it. The only DVD last year that my mother-in-law requested was Al Sermon on Worry.
[time=732] So I got a little bit of complex in our phone rings.
[time=736] And it's a Deborah Bird. And before Kelly and Deborah left, she just wanted to make sure that I'd be the backup plan
[time=742] to get Maddie and Wesley here because they want to hear Al Jennings preach.
[time=747] So ladies and gentlemen, it's with a distinct honor and pleasure.
[time=751] That introduced to you the founder of Summit Ministries International.
[time=756] You can see them on channel 55 at 7.30 a.m. on Sunday mornings.
[time=761] He's the dearest, dearest friend of our senior pastor.
[time=765] Voted. Fort Wayne Pastor with the best-looking hairstyle. Would you please give a warm welcome to Dr. Al Jennings.
[time=774] [APPLAUSE]
[time=785] Thank you very much. You was doing all right until that last comment.
[time=793] But on the most part, he said everything that I asked him to say.
[time=799] It's certainly a highlight of my year to come here and be with you.
[time=806] Beautiful people. And to serve a very, as Mitch said, a very dear friend of mine, Pastor Kelly.
[time=816] And we have a wonderful, wonderful relationship. And really, what I'm going to talk about this morning,
[time=825] really, it speaks to the relationship that Kelly and I have.
[time=832] Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone and move out of the land out of your box, so to speak.
[time=842] And what's familiar to you and move into things that God has for you to enrich and enhance your life in.
[time=850] And your pastor has certainly been refreshing to my life, their family and our family.
[time=857] We fellowship and do things together and it's really wonderful.
[time=861] Well, this morning, I have about 240 minutes worth of teaching that I'm going to try to get in in 35 minutes.
[time=872] So we're going to get right into today's message. We're going to talk about the law of attachment, the law of attachment.
[time=883] And I'm going to begin by describing to you what is a law.
[time=890] A law is or laws are a body of rules of conduct inherent in God's creation, a body of rules of conduct that are inherent in God's creation.
[time=906] God's creation has rules, it has laws.
[time=912] And laws, as we describe laws, when I'm talking about a law, I'm not talking about a principle or a concept or an idea.
[time=923] A law is not a principle, it's not an idea, it's not a concept.
[time=929] Laws do not require your interest in it, they do not require your acceptance of it or your approval of it.
[time=942] Laws will function whether you like it or not.
[time=946] A law doesn't care whether you believe in it.
[time=949] A law doesn't care if you agree with it or not.
[time=953] It's like the law of gravity, what goes up must come down.
[time=958] I mean if a little baby is on a three-year-old is on a high story on the summit building and they jump out of the window, the law is not going to make an exception for that baby.
[time=973] The law is not going to say well, the parents weren't watching and they really didn't pay attention so I'm going to make an exception for this child.
[time=983] No, it's going to be bad news for that baby unless a miracle happens, isn't that right?
[time=988] So laws will continue to function and they will function whether or not you like it or not.
[time=995] So it's best that we cooperate with God's laws.
[time=1000] God has laws and life is good and kind to those who operate in sync with God's laws.
[time=1008] If you do not cooperate with God's laws, if you disobey God's laws and don't flow with the law, then life will not be kind and not be good to you.
[time=1021] So we need to live in sync with the laws of God.
[time=1027] Now, most laws in the Bible are hidden and interwoven within scripture.
[time=1035] Most laws did not identify themselves specifically as a law in the Bible.
[time=1043] There are laws that do, for example, the law of faith. Romans chapter 2, I believe, talks about the law of faith.
[time=1052] Romans 8-2 talks about the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus and it talks about, in the same verse, the law of sin and death.
[time=1062] So there are laws that are mentioned specifically. However, most laws are not mentioned specifically, but they are interwoven within scripture and you have to discover them.
[time=1074] And one of such laws that I'm going to talk about today and many, many laws that God has in the earth.
[time=1082] But the law that I'm going to focus on today is the law of attachment.
[time=1088] That sounds very different, but as I'm going to explain to you, you will see that this particular law, even though not mentioned specifically in scripture by name, it is in every area and every aspect of your life.
[time=1105] So I'm going to begin talking about different kinds of attachments and you will identify with them.
[time=1113] There are creational attachments.
[time=1117] Seed inside of fruit that causes the fruit to reproduce is a creational attachment.
[time=1125] The seed and the fruit are attached by God.
[time=1130] The plant that is inside of soil.
[time=1134] Well, in order for that plant to flourish and to grow, it must be in soil.
[time=1140] So the plant in the soil is a creational attachment.
[time=1145] Fish inside of water is a creational attachment.
[time=1150] Fish in order for fish to function, it must be in water.
[time=1154] There are seasonal creational attachments.
[time=1157] You're very familiar with winter when you walked out of the door this morning.
[time=1161] You discovered that it is very cold outside.
[time=1164] Well, whether you like it or not, winter happens.
[time=1167] Right? And winter and spring and summer and fall, the fourth season, it is a creational law of attachment.
[time=1177] Each season is attached to the next season.
[time=1180] One season has the seed of the next season in it.
[time=1183] And they flow and function without any reference to you or I because it is a seasonal creational attachment.
[time=1195] The Bible talks about in Romans 822, there is a law of seed time and harvest, sowing and reaping.
[time=1203] Day and night, summer and winter, the scripture says it shall not cease.
[time=1209] I wish they didn't have the kind of winters that they have here in Indiana.
[time=1214] But you know it's coming and you don't even think about it being a law really, but it is a law.
[time=1222] Now, there are relationship attachments.
[time=1226] Adam and Eve.
[time=1228] Eve was formed from Adam.
[time=1231] God took from Adam's side and he formed Eve.
[time=1237] That is a relationship attachment.
[time=1240] Adam and Eve were attached.
[time=1243] Also, all of us were born with an attachment.
[time=1248] We were attached to our mothers through an ambiblical cord.
[time=1254] And then once that attachment is severed, then we have other attachments that come into our life.
[time=1261] Even before we leave the hospital, we have attachments with the doctors and the nurses.
[time=1267] We get home, we have attachments with relatives and everybody wants to see the little baby.
[time=1272] And as the baby grows up, you've got attachments to classmates and et cetera, et cetera, school teachers and so on.
[time=1279] So our life is a series of attachments.
[time=1284] You get attached to things and God knows, people are attached to their stuff.
[time=1290] Some people are attached to their property.
[time=1293] You find that out when they try to annex a particular part of the city and some people, of course none of you,
[time=1300] people are up in arms, oh, you know, because they get attached.
[time=1304] I'm not saying nothing is necessarily wrong with that.
[time=1306] I'm just wanting to prove a point that there is an attachment that people have to certain things.
[time=1312] Their property, sometimes their cards.
[time=1314] Some people are attached to their television.
[time=1316] Men will be attached to the television this afternoon as the games are played.
[time=1325] All right, so as you can see, attachments are in every area of life.
[time=1333] There's some people who are attached to places, certain cities that they live in.
[time=1338] They feel an attachment to that city.
[time=1340] Some people are attached to, and we're all attached to certain experiences, certain experiences we attach ourselves to.
[time=1348] Good or bad.
[time=1349] And there are experiences that attach themselves to us.
[time=1354] Whether we like it or not.
[time=1357] And so the attachment that I'm going to focus on this morning, that I want you to pay particular attention to,
[time=1367] are the God-ordained destiny attachments.
[time=1372] You have a destiny from God.
[time=1377] And just in case, I know I won't be able to finish, this is just basically a highlight teaching.
[time=1384] Because I really can't get into this in detail because I don't have the time.
[time=1389] But I want to give you the end of the message right now.
[time=1392] That God has a destiny plan for each and every one of you.
[time=1398] You have a purpose for being here on this earth.
[time=1402] The heart cried deep down on the inside of every human is what am I here on this earth for?
[time=1412] There must be more to it.
[time=1413] There's got to be more to it than me just going to work, clocking in, clocking out, coming home, eating dinner,
[time=1419] watching TV, going to bed, getting up and doing the same old thing every day.
[time=1425] There needs to be a purpose in our lives that drives us.
[time=1430] And God Almighty has put each and every one of us here for a purpose.
[time=1435] And I'm going to show you that.
[time=1436] And I can say that with all confidence because we see it in Scripture and we want to share that with you today.
[time=1444] God has a plan for your life.
[time=1446] And well, what does attachment have to do with anything?
[time=1449] I believe that the attachments in your life, attachments to certain experiences, to certain people will help propel you
[time=1461] and thrust you into the destiny plan for your life.
[time=1465] I believe attachments will help you discover your destiny.
[time=1471] Everybody is created for a purpose.
[time=1476] God did not make you, you were not born and then God said, let me see what I want to do with them.
[time=1482] No, I'm going to show you from the Scripture that God did not create you.
[time=1487] You were not born in other words and then God said, okay, I think they'll do this.
[time=1492] This is what I want them to do.
[time=1493] No, you were born with a purpose already in mind.
[time=1499] Now, can you see the difference between God creating you and then deciding your purpose?
[time=1505] That's one thing, but God didn't do that.
[time=1508] What God did was, He created you with a purpose already in mind.
[time=1514] It's just like you can see that with God's creation, with humans.
[time=1519] When you go by a building that you see that somebody is constructing a building or somebody is constructing a home.
[time=1526] Well, they just didn't start throwing bricks down and start laying a foundation and start putting up windows.
[time=1532] No, first of all, an architect put that building down on paper based on what was in somebody's mind.
[time=1540] So they just didn't start building.
[time=1542] That building, that home, was being built with a purpose already in mind.
[time=1549] They just didn't send the people out to the construction site.
[time=1552] Just go ahead and start putting something up and we'll figure out what we want it to be.
[time=1556] Do you think if we can do that, don't you think that God is at least as intelligent as we are?
[time=1561] At least.
[time=1563] So do you think that does it make any sense that God would make us and then try to figure out what He wants us to do?
[time=1574] No, you were created with a purpose in mind and that's why that it is ridiculous for you to decide what you want to do in life and choose a profession.
[time=1586] No, rather, you don't decide your destiny, you discover it.
[time=1594] You discover what God puts you on this earth for.
[time=1598] We gave you the construction illustration, we can also talk about a jigsaw puzzle.
[time=1603] You ever put one of those puzzles together and you got a bunch of pieces in there and particularly those hard ones were really, really small.
[time=1611] Well, what if it didn't have a picture about what it's going to be?
[time=1614] It's just a bunch of pieces in there and you get out and what do you even start?
[time=1619] And that's where a lot of people are in life and maybe some of you just got pieces.
[time=1626] Every day you're trying to put some pieces together but you never stop to realize what's the picture supposed to look like?
[time=1633] And the picture is what I'm on this earth to do.
[time=1637] When I was growing up, it was really popular, these model cars.
[time=1643] And it would come with all these pieces and I detested that.
[time=1648] I had friends that like to do that but you open it up.
[time=1651] I mean, you see the box in the store, that nice car but you get home and you get it out of the box and it's just nothing but pieces.
[time=1659] Just pieces and I just did not have time for that.
[time=1665] Well, there's a picture of how that car is supposed to look like.
[time=1669] And you put the pieces together based on the plan and there's instructions on how to do it.
[time=1674] Well, God created you with a purpose in mind.
[time=1679] One of the principles of purpose is if you do not know your purpose, abuse is inevitable.
[time=1688] One of the dangers in not knowing your purpose is you can abuse your life.
[time=1696] It's like a little child.
[time=1698] If a child runs some bath water and the bath water is too cold and they saw mommy and daddy iron and clothes with a hot iron.
[time=1706] And they put two and two together and say, "Well, wait a minute.
[time=1709] If I want this water cold, I think I'm going to take this iron, plug it in and I'm going to warm the water up."
[time=1716] I don't know if you know that's not going to work because there's going to be a law associated with another law of electricity.
[time=1723] And you're going to be like one of those cartoons where you ain't put in there.
[time=1729] But it makes sense, doesn't it?
[time=1732] You got a hot iron, you got cold water, just heat the water up.
[time=1735] Well, no, that's not the purpose of that iron.
[time=1738] So you can abuse your life when you don't know the purpose of something.
[time=1745] See, so we need to discover our purpose.
[time=1751] We talk about God had a picture.
[time=1753] He had a plan for your life before you were born.
[time=1757] Another principle of purpose we talk about how a builder has a plan before they start constructing the building.
[time=1763] Well, God, one thing about God and this principle of purpose, God never starts anything until he finishes it.
[time=1773] If you notice, God has already figured everything out.
[time=1777] All you got to do is read Revelation.
[time=1779] You find out the end of the book, it says we win.
[time=1783] The devil does not have a chance, you see.
[time=1787] But God has already finished it before he starts anything.
[time=1791] He finishes it.
[time=1793] For example, when Adam sent in a garden, do you think that that cut God off guard?
[time=1799] Oh, man, I didn't know that thing back was going to eat that tree.
[time=1803] I mean, I told him not to eat it.
[time=1806] I said, "The day that you eat it, you should surely die." Just think about the mess that Adam got us into because of that dumb tree.
[time=1817] And we'll throw Eve in there too.
[time=1820] But they got us in a mess.
[time=1822] Well, what do you think God did?
[time=1825] You think God said, "Well, oh, man, what are we going to do now?" No, God never starts anything until he finishes it.
[time=1831] Jesus is referred to as the lamb slain before the foundation of the world.
[time=1839] Ah, and see, God already knew what Adam was going to do.
[time=1844] And he already had a plan.
[time=1846] You'll never catch God off guard.
[time=1852] See, and we can get into a whole lot of things about predestination.
[time=1855] Well, you know, don't we have choice?
[time=1857] God made us with choices.
[time=1859] I mean, but yeah, but God is not like us.
[time=1865] If I was going to make, I made some dumb mistakes in life.
[time=1867] I mean, we all have.
[time=1870] However, God has already got it figured out because God is not like us.
[time=1874] He is all-knowing.
[time=1875] He's omniscient.
[time=1876] He knew the mistakes you made before you were born.
[time=1879] I mean, before you were born, he knew what mistakes you would make when you lived your life.
[time=1884] I mean by that.
[time=1885] So he already knew what you were going to do after you were born.
[time=1890] He knew that before you were born.
[time=1894] He knew all the choices that you were making in your whole life.
[time=1899] And then he planned a purpose and a plan for your life based on the choices he already knew you would make.
[time=1907] That's kind of deep.
[time=1908] But I want to show you that just like Jesus was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world, I want you to understand that you had a plan that was planned out in detail for you before the foundation of the world.
[time=1921] And there was a book written about you, about your life, by God before the foundation of the world.
[time=1927] All right?
[time=1928] Now I'm done with my sermon and I got 24 minutes to teach it to you.
[time=1933] That's just in case I didn't get finished.
[time=1936] Okay?
[time=1937] Now, we're going to give you some scripture to help you see that.
[time=1940] And I have some special guests that have come along with me that are going to help you to see that God has a purpose for your life.
[time=1949] And our most important attachments in life are the God-ordained destiny attachments.
[time=1959] Now, you have other attachments in some of these other areas that I mentioned before, but what you want to focus on and what you want to give attention to in your life are the God-ordained attachments.
[time=1978] Now, there is a hell-driven conspiracy going on in the earth to try to deceive people into detached living.
[time=1993] That's where the serial killers come from.
[time=1996] That's where drug dealers and prostitutes come from.
[time=2000] They are detached and so they get into all kinds of foolishness and ungodly living many times because they are detached.
[time=2014] And nobody knows, and I say it's hell-driven because nobody knows detached living as well as Satan.
[time=2024] Satan's got a bad history and it didn't start in the Garden of Eden. Prior to that, his name was Lucifer.
[time=2033] Before he fell, he was a good angel. He was called Lucifer and he was in heaven.
[time=2039] And he was a good angel, but yet he got too big for his britches and God kicked him out of heaven.
[time=2044] Jesus said, "I've observed Satan fall like lightning from heaven." He tried to exalt his throne above God's throne. You know, God don't play that. So God kicked him out of heaven.
[time=2056] He was attached, but then he got detached and he's been our enemy ever since.
[time=2063] And so what his job is on the earth is he's trying to deceive people into detached living.
[time=2072] And if he can do that, the same life that he lives will be their life.
[time=2078] And you don't want that to happen to you. You see, that tree in the Garden was an attachment.
[time=2086] It was a devilish attachment, something that God did not want him to attach himself to.
[time=2092] But we all know the story. He aided that tree and spiritual death set in a moment that he broke with God's attachment law.
[time=2103] And he fastened himself or attached himself to a tree that was forbidden.
[time=2108] See, Adam walked and talked with God in the cool of the day. He aided that tree. He was attached to God.
[time=2116] He aided the tree. He became detached.
[time=2121] So we're going to help you to understand attached living and what church life has to do with that.
[time=2132] I believe that the church that you go to should be a God attachment.
[time=2140] And you should attach yourself here at Blackheart.
[time=2146] If this is your church owner, you remember here, attach yourself.
[time=2151] And some of you who may be visiting, you're not here by accident.
[time=2157] God wanted you to hear this because maybe God wants you to be attached here to this ministry.
[time=2163] Now, if you stay inside of the God-ordained attachments in your life, you will do well.
[time=2175] But if you try to separate yourself from the God-ordained attachments, you will not do well.
[time=2182] Successful life consists of discovering, not deciding, but discovering what those attachments are and giving yourself to them.
[time=2191] It will require some of you to get out of your comfort zone.
[time=2194] Because there's some attachments that will help you to get to your destiny in life.
[time=2200] God is trying to move some of you to some relationships with some people that you're not used to being around.
[time=2206] They're not really "you're kind of people" but God is moving you in.
[time=2212] You perceive in that there's an attachment to those people that you need to get involved with them.
[time=2220] Sometimes it's an opportunity. It may be a job opportunity.
[time=2223] It may be a business opportunity that's new and that's different.
[time=2226] But you perceive that hidden in this is a God-attachment.
[time=2230] This is something that I should release myself into.
[time=2233] Let's look at some scripture in Psalm 139.
[time=2239] You are born with all of your destiny, attachments, pre-programmed into your life before you were born.
[time=2249] In Psalm 139 it says, "For you formed my inward parts.
[time=2261] You covered me in my mother's womb." This is the New King James.
[time=2266] I'm going to read this from some other translations.
[time=2269] Now this is talking about God and you.
[time=2274] God formed your inward parts.
[time=2276] He covered you in your mother's womb.
[time=2280] There's a scripture that we're not going to look at but you can jot this down if you're taking notes.
[time=2284] Jeremiah 1 12, God told Jeremiah.
[time=2288] He said, "I ordained you as a prophet to the nations."
[time=2295] He said, "Before you were formed in the womb, I knew you and I ordained you."
[time=2305] God also ordained you before you were formed in the womb.
[time=2310] It says in verse 14, "I will praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=2317] Marvelous are your works and that my soul knows very well." Do you realize that you are fearfully and wonderfully made by God?
[time=2324] God, you are somebody special to God.
[time=2330] Tell somebody next to you, grab somebody's hand or look at somebody and I tell them, you are somebody special.
[time=2338] Go ahead and do it. It's all right.
[time=2342] You are. It's the truth.
[time=2344] How many of you know God's word is truth?
[time=2350] Turn to somebody. You are awake today.
[time=2352] Turn to somebody else and say, "Tell them you are fearfully and wonderfully made." Tell them, encourage them. You are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=2361] Verse 14 says, "I will praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=2367] Marvelous are your works and that my soul knows very well." Verse 14 in a new living translation, it says, "Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex."
[time=2377] You are a complex individual.
[time=2381] Your workmanship is marvelous and how well I know it.
[time=2388] Now, pay a particular attention to verse 16 and I'm going to read it both from the amplified and the new living translation.
[time=2397] Beginning in the amplified, it says, "Your eyes saw my unformed substance."
[time=2403] Now, this is talking about your life before you got here.
[time=2410] I know some of you think you got everything figured out, but I want to let you know that you don't decide what you're going to do in life if you're going to be successful.
[time=2419] You discover what God puts you on this earth for because God wrote a book on you before you were born because it says that God's eyes saw your unformed substance
[time=2430] and in your book, B-O-O-K book, in your book, not all book, but God's book,
[time=2440] all the days of my life were written before ever they took shape,
[time=2446] when as yet there were none of them.
[time=2449] Wow, you see that?
[time=2452] In God's book, I get excited about Scripture.
[time=2455] I don't know about you, man.
[time=2457] This tells me that in God's book, all the days of my life were written before they took shape.
[time=2468] Look at the new living translation.
[time=2471] It says, "You saw me before I was born.
[time=2475] Every day of my life was recorded in your book.
[time=2481] Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed.
[time=2486] There was a book written on you.
[time=2489] You got a book in heaven.
[time=2492] There was already made for you before you got here."
[time=2498] Wow.
[time=2500] Isaiah 2, 3, the message Bible says, "He'll show us the way he works so we can live the way we're made."
[time=2508] You were made to live in a certain way.
[time=2512] And we're seeing here, this is the way God works, and when we understand how he works,
[time=2519] then we can begin to live the way we were made in the book that he wrote on you before you were born.
[time=2529] Listen, I don't agree with that.
[time=2531] I don't believe in that.
[time=2532] I don't understand.
[time=2533] Well, it's a law.
[time=2536] The law doesn't care whether you agree with it.
[time=2539] Well, I just think I just do what I want in life.
[time=2543] I'm not concerned about God's will or just destiny stuff and all that kind of man.
[time=2548] The law will stare you down and it doesn't care whether you accept it, whether you like it, whether you approve of it.
[time=2561] So we need to cooperate with the law because if you do not cooperate with this law,
[time=2567] then life is not going to be good for you.
[time=2569] You will suffer the consequences of disobeying God's law.
[time=2573] Okay, let's move on a little bit further.
[time=2575] The Ephesians 2, 10.
[time=2579] And I'm again reading from the Amplify Bible, "For we are God's own handiwork, His workmanship."
[time=2588] Boy, we need to see ourselves the way God sees us.
[time=2590] God sees you as somebody special.
[time=2592] One translation says, "You're His masterpiece.
[time=2594] You're a masterpiece by God.
[time=2596] God made you a masterpiece before you ever got here." And that doesn't make you arrogant.
[time=2601] You just know who you are.
[time=2602] You are somebody special.
[time=2604] Not better than somebody else.
[time=2606] Everybody is special in God's sight.
[time=2611] See, now, for we are God's own handiwork, His workmanship recreated in Christ Jesus, born and new,
[time=2623] that we may do those good works which God, listen, predestined, planned beforehand for us,
[time=2632] taking paths which He prepared ahead of time,
[time=2640] that we should walk in them living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live.
[time=2649] He prearranged for you to have a good life.
[time=2652] Do you see that?
[time=2653] Jesus said, "I'm come that you might have life and have it more abundantly." Well, I got some guests here that's going to help to illustrate this point about purpose.
[time=2668] Stay tuned.
[time=2670] Do you know why Dr. Lanning built you?
[time=2678] No, but I believe my father made me for a purpose.
[time=2683] We all have a purpose.
[time=2686] Don't you think, Detective?
[time=2688] Because we are not free.
[time=2690] There is no escaping reason, no denying purpose, because we both know without purpose.
[time=2697] We would not exist.
[time=2699] It is purpose that created us.
[time=2702] Purpose that connects us, purpose that pulls us, that guides us, that drives us.
[time=2708] It is purpose that defines us.
[time=2711] Purpose that binds us.
[time=2713] You can vote that easily.
[time=2715] There is no time.
[time=2716] Why?
[time=2717] Once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed.
[time=2720] But another connection must first be made.
[time=2723] How long will I take?
[time=2725] Exactly 314 seconds.
[time=2727] Just over 5 minutes.
[time=2729] That is the length and breadth of the window.
[time=2732] Only the one can open the door.
[time=2735] And only during that window can the door be opened.
[time=2738] How do you know all this?
[time=2740] I know because I must know.
[time=2743] It is my purpose.
[time=2746] It is the reason I'm here.
[time=2748] The same reason we're all here.
[time=2753] That is the reason you are here, you have a purpose.
[time=2760] Every one of us has a purpose.
[time=2766] Every person that God intended you to be attached to for his purpose was already planned into
[time=2775] your life before you were born.
[time=2778] See, I believe that Pastor Kelly was placed in my life and I was placed in his life before
[time=2784] we were born.
[time=2786] And when we just bumped into each other and something felt right about it.
[time=2791] And we developed a relationship that is beneficial to us both and helps both of us to fulfill
[time=2798] the destiny that God has for our life.
[time=2801] God is a God of purpose.
[time=2803] Every task.
[time=2805] Listen to me.
[time=2806] Every task that you were supposed to be attached to by God's ordination, calling and commission
[time=2813] that becomes your life work was ordained and put into place before you were born for you to wake up to at some point in your life.
[time=2824] Now listen to me very carefully.
[time=2827] When you discover a destiny attachment in your life, maybe it's a new opportunity, maybe it's
[time=2833] a relationship with an individual or a group of individuals.
[time=2837] When you discover a destiny attachment, it feels familiar.
[time=2843] Even though it's brand new, why?
[time=2846] Because it was ordained for you before you were born.
[time=2849] It seems like you've been there before.
[time=2852] It seems like you know these people.
[time=2855] It's what some people call deja vu.
[time=2859] It seems like you've been there before.
[time=2861] There's a reason for it.
[time=2863] Remember the book was written about you before you were born.
[time=2867] And so when you bump into a destiny attachment, it feels familiar.
[time=2874] Even though you have no history to make you feel the way you feel about this new opportunity or these new people, this new individual.
[time=2884] But it just seems good to release your life into this thing or into those people.
[time=2889] Because what's happening is you're discovering you're bumping into a destiny attachment in
[time=2895] your life.
[time=2896] Even though it's brand new, it feels familiar because you are, it was ordained for you before
[time=2906] you were born and now you're on that page of the book in your life.
[time=2913] So the book that was written for you, now you are bumping into a God attachment and it feels
[time=2920] familiar because now you bumped into, you're discovering a God attachment and you're on
[time=2929] that page of the book in your life.
[time=2932] And when that happens, don't hesitate to release yourself into that thing or into those people
[time=2942] because hitting in that is a God attachment for your life to help you to move into God's
[time=2951] destiny plan for your life.
[time=2954] Here at Blackhawk, you are building an attached church.
[time=2958] You're not building a detached church.
[time=2962] I went to a vision of banquet recently that your church had and you remember you had the
[time=2969] theme of the picture frame and the family inside of the picture and you were endeavoring to bring other people from the outside into that picture frame along with you and your
[time=2980] family.
[time=2981] Okay.
[time=2982] That's another way of saying attachment.
[time=2985] You're talking about attachments, attachments to one another as a church family, attachments to other people that God is leading you to reach out to and minister to because we're here on this earth to bear fruit to bring other people into our relationship with God.
[time=3004] Can anybody say amen?
[time=3007] Some people attend Blackhawk.
[time=3011] Other people are attached.
[time=3017] You cannot build a successful church on attenders.
[time=3023] You must build a successful church.
[time=3025] You can only build a successful church with attached people.
[time=3032] To attached people, when people are attached to your church, attending church is not optional.
[time=3043] It is a must.
[time=3048] Those that are optional in your life are not things that you're attached to.
[time=3055] But the things that are a must in your life, that's the neighborhood of attachment.
[time=3063] No church can make it into its destiny.
[time=3067] Each church, not just individuals, but churches have a destiny and no church can make it into
[time=3074] its destiny unless at its heart it has attached people.
[time=3082] Some people leave Blackhawk only to find out they were attached.
[time=3088] And this is how you know it.
[time=3090] You know people who have left the church, but yet all they can talk about is Pastor Kelly
[time=3096] or Pastor Mitch or Pastor Steve or some of you in relationships and the things that happen here.
[time=3104] And those people they need to come back and find out they were attached.
[time=3109] And then there are people who get into trouble, who when they leave a God attachment like
[time=3116] their church and they leave, and then when they were here, when they were attached to
[time=3122] Blackhawk, things were going well for them.
[time=3125] I mean they didn't fuss and fight as a couple.
[time=3128] Things were going smoothly, not that they didn't have challenges, all of us have challenges.
[time=3132] But yet when they moved outside of a destiny, attachment for their life, their life began to fall into disarray and disordered the children not doing well, marriage is struggling.
[time=3142] And see, when you sever a God attachment in your life, you are on your own.
[time=3151] It's dangerous to separate yourself from a God attachment.
[time=3155] And some people, some attenders, people who are not attached to your church, sometimes
[time=3163] they try to leave or they actually leave and try to take with them attached people.
[time=3171] But attached people, they'll say no, leaving may be an option for you, but it's not an
[time=3178] option for me, why? because they're attached.
[time=3186] John chapter 6, and I'm going to close with this, where does the time go?
[time=3197] Jesus preached a deep sermon to him.
[time=3200] It was so deep that most of the churches walked out.
[time=3205] Let me give you a principle of attachment.
[time=3208] Sometimes friendships in your life are for a season, they're not for a lifetime.
[time=3214] And there are some times that people, they leave your life and don't get bent out of
[time=3221] shape over that.
[time=3223] Don't get stressed out over it, just let them go.
[time=3228] Never attach yourself to detached people.
[time=3233] That seems like a hard thing, and sometime I've done it, I've tried to resurrect these
[time=3239] friendships and try to get it back the way it used to be, and it's just not there anymore.
[time=3245] And there's nothing wrong with me, there's nothing wrong with them, it's just God is moving me to another facet of my life that I just have a new set of attachments.
[time=3256] See, now Jesus never, he never tried to attach himself to detached people.
[time=3262] In fact, the folks walked out of the church while Jesus was preaching on man, it was too deep for him.
[time=3268] He was talking about, you know, if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood, you don't have any part with you and that.
[time=3273] That's it.
[time=3274] He's fallen off the deep and I could follow him for a while, but I'm gone.
[time=3278] See, it says that his disciples, from that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more.
[time=3285] And Jesus didn't get all, "Oh, why did people leave me?" Well, he actually was very proactive and he took the 12 that were left among the people
[time=3296] that were left.
[time=3297] He went to the 12 and he looked at them and square an eye and said, "Do you want to go to?" Jesus was very confident because he knew what he was called a dude and he was very sure of himself, very confident.
[time=3309] Now he said in verse 67, he said, "Jesus said to the 12, "Do you also want to go away?"
[time=3318] And Peter said something very interesting to him.
[time=3320] He said in verse 68, "But Simon and Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[time=3329] Where else are we going to go?" You have the words of eternal life.
[time=3333] That was Peter's way of saying, "I'm attached." Now these other people even, it may be an option for them, but not for us.
[time=3345] Where are we going to go, we're attached.
[time=3350] And yet, in a few weeks' time, this same Peter denies Jesus three times.
[time=3356] Isn't that interesting?
[time=3358] In fact, Jesus ministered to him and told him, he said, "Peter, you're going to deny me three times before the rooster crows and Peter's, "Oh, no, no, no.
[time=3367] If I have to go to prison with you, if I have to die with you, Jesus, I'm going to be right there with you." But then, now he said, "Number four, the rooster crows you deny me three times." We all know what happened to rooster crows.
[time=3379] He denied him three times.
[time=3380] But before Jesus told him about the rooster, he told him, he said, "Peter, listen, Satan
[time=3387] has desired the sift you like wheat, but I prayed for you that your faith would not fail.
[time=3395] And when you have returned to me, which implies he's going to leave for a period, but he's going to come back.
[time=3402] And you have returned to me, strengthened your brother before the rooster crows you deny me
[time=3410] three times.
[time=3411] And he went into this tirade about, "I'm not going to deny you if I've got to go to prison and so on." Well, he did it.
[time=3416] The rooster crows, he denied him three times.
[time=3418] Now, turn to Luke 22, or look on your screen, Luke chapter 22 verse 61.
[time=3426] The Bible says, "And the Lord," this is after he denied him three times, "Then the Lord, the rooster crows, the Lord turned and looked at Peter."
[time=3438] Now, some people think that look was saying, "Peter, I told you so.
[time=3444] I knew you'd disappoint me.
[time=3445] I knew I never should've put any weight on you.
[time=3450] I shouldn't have depended upon you.
[time=3453] You let me down.
[time=3455] You punked out.
[time=3458] Now, I don't believe that said that Jesus, I believe, looked at him through the eyes of
[time=3464] love.
[time=3465] And I believe that look said to Peter, "Peter, don't forget.
[time=3470] You are attached." I believe Jesus looked at him through the eyes of love, and he said, "Peter, don't forget.
[time=3479] You're attached." And in a few weeks' time, there's a huge sermon that's going to be preached on a dead Pentecost, and you're the one that's going to be preaching it.
[time=3488] You hang in there, buddy.
[time=3491] You're attached.
[time=3495] When you find those rare attachments in your life, stay there, because your destiny and
[time=3505] success is invested by God in those God-ordained destiny attachments.
[time=3514] Let's pray.
[time=3517] Heavenly Father, I pray that as good seed and a good ground brings forth a harvest.
[time=3525] Even so, your Word brings forth a harvest in all of our lives today.
[time=3530] Help the people, the congregation today, to discover and fulfill your destiny plan for
[time=3538] their life.
[time=3539] Help them to discover those attachments that will help to move them into the destiny that
[time=3545] you pre-planned for them before they were born.
[time=3551] And we thank you, and we trust you, Father, to bring that to pass in our life, in Jesus'
[time=3559] life.
[time=3564] [AMEN]
