[time=60] (upbeat music)
[time=90] [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=207] (upbeat music)
[time=240] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=274] (upbeat music)
[time=296] (upbeat music) - Why me, Lord?
[time=301] Who am I that you would even know my name?
[time=306] Let alone call me friend.
[time=308] You proclaim that you will build your church on the one you call the Rock.
[time=314] Peter, me?
[time=318] I'm too flawed, too doubtful and wavering in my faith.
[time=321] I can't be the one you called to lead these people.
[time=326] Lord, you know who I really am.
[time=330] So why would you have called me?
[time=333] I remember that day, as if it were yesterday.
[time=342] Jesus was preaching on the shore of the Sea of Galilee as he had been for several days now.
[time=348] The crowds kept getting bigger and bigger as word of his teaching spread.
[time=352] That morning, he was on that very shore where me and Andrew, John, and James, our partners, had just collapsed to catch our breath after a long, fruitless night of fishing.
[time=363] We had nets to mend and wash, and we were so tired and hungry that we didn't even feel the crowds pressing in on us to get closer to Jesus.
[time=371] And that morning, he asked if you could borrow my boat.
[time=375] Sure.
[time=380] Well, I hope she treats them better than she treated us last night.
[time=384] We came up empty.
[time=386] Yeah, we got skunked.
[time=388] I can't believe the crowds are here again.
[time=391] It's too bad we didn't have a good catch.
[time=393] We kind of sold the whole lot on the shore and went for breakfast.
[time=396] There you go thinking about your stomach again.
[time=399] Now me, I'm thinking about a bed and a bath.
[time=405] Good thing too.
[time=408] You smell like fish again, brother.
[time=409] Oh yeah, right.
[time=412] What's that again, master?
[time=414] You want us to take our boat out into the deeper water?
[time=418] But master, we worked hard all last night and didn't catch a thing.
[time=422] But if you want us to, we'll go out and try again.
[time=427] Oh no, I believe you.
[time=428] Go home.
[time=429] Weren't we just here?
[time=432] Yeah.
[time=433] Fuckin' darn late.
[time=435] Oh no.
[time=436] I don't know.
[time=437] Here it goes.
[time=440] There's nothing in this. It's a stick.
[time=443] Same old glory.
[time=444] Tighter, tighter.
[time=445] Oh John, James! Come on, let's help.
[time=447] Come help.
[time=448] Oh my God. Look, the size of this.
[time=450] Oh, I've never seen this.
[time=451] John, no move.
[time=452] You'll send us off with the weight of this catch.
[time=454] Oh Peter, one more time.
[time=456] I got it.
[time=457] The demon.
[time=458] Oh Lord, please leave me.
[time=467] I'm too much of a sinner to even be around you.
[time=471] (sighs) He said to us, "Come, and I will make you fissures of men." Wasn't quite sure what that meant, but I went.
[time=481] I dropped my net, overflowing with fish, and I went.
[time=487] I felt so strong and full of confidence that day.
[time=490] But there were other days to come.
[time=493] Over and over, I found myself with such little faith.
[time=499] And when they were done, there were 12 baskets of leftovers.
[time=503] After over 5,000 flesh, I wouldn't have believed in myself if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
[time=509] It was incredible.
[time=510] I understand you have another tale to tell me that even my own husband hasn't spoke on.
[time=515] Oh no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[time=517] It is best to hear it from the source.
[time=518] Go ahead, Andrew, tell us.
[time=520] Oh, okay. Okay.
[time=521] You know, the day that they fed all those people, the Jesus fed all those people with just the five loaves, the two fishes, you know, he asked us to go out into the boat in the water, and then he went back the hill by himself.
[time=532] It was well after midnight when the waves came up.
[time=535] It was so windy, we thought for sure we were in for some serious trouble.
[time=540] And then we saw it out there on the water.
[time=543] So what?
[time=544] We thought it was a ghost.
[time=546] A ghost.
[time=548] John was like a servant girl.
[time=551] He nearly fell overboard.
[time=553] His eyes were as big as servants' plates.
[time=555] That's not a ghost.
[time=557] It wasn't really a ghost, was it?
[time=559] No, it was Jesus, right?
[time=562] And he was walking on the water.
[time=566] Look at that piece.
[time=567] He said, "Don't be afraid.
[time=569] I'm coming." And then Peter says, "Okay, Lord, if it's really you,
[time=576] call out to me and I'll come out to you." Just like that.
[time=580] And Jesus looks at him and says, "All right, come." He's at the sight of the boat and he's looking out at the waves, knowing that he has to go in there now.
[time=591] And then John, he starts chatting, "Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter!"
[time=600] And then he goes out and he stands on the side of the boat and he sticks his left foot
[time=606] in the water, just dabs his big toe like this.
[time=611] And he gets all nervous and he starts to twitch, you know, like he does.
[time=614] Then he slides his right foot in, he slides his right foot out, he slides his right foot
[time=624] in, and then he shakes his dog about.
[time=627] He went to meet the Savior and then he near and he drowned, that's what it's all about.
[time=635] What happened next?
[time=637] Well then just before he went under, Jesus reached out and he took his hand.
[time=640] It just lifted him right back up on top.
[time=643] And then they got it in the boat and then guys, then the waves and the wind stopped.
[time=649] Just like that.
[time=650] He told me still, it was totally awesome.
[time=654] Awesome.
[time=656] It was awesome.
[time=661] And yet Jesus said to me, "You don't have much faith.
[time=664] Why did you doubt me?" That could be the question of my life.
[time=671] Why, Lord?
[time=673] Why do I doubt your choice of me?
[time=676] I lived with you, I followed you, I loved you, and I denied you.
[time=685] You, you were one of the ones with Jesus, the accused.
[time=691] No, no, no.
[time=692] I don't know what you're talking about.
[time=693] I'm telling you, I saw him over there.
[time=695] Well, there he is.
[time=696] This man.
[time=697] This man was with Jesus of Nazna.
[time=698] No, no, no.
[time=699] I don't even know the man.
[time=700] I heard him myself.
[time=702] No one.
[time=703] You must be one of them.
[time=704] We can tell by your accents.
[time=705] You're from Galilee.
[time=706] You've come with Jesus, haven't you?
[time=708] I swear by God, I do not know the man.
[time=713] I told him, even if everyone else deserts you, I never will.
[time=722] Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you, my Lord.
[time=729] Why me?
[time=732] Who am I that you would even know my name, let alone call me friend?
[time=735] I can't be the one you called to lead these people.
[time=740] Lord, you know who I really am.
[time=746] So why would you have called me?
[time=748] Well, I want to tell you how looking forward I've been to what is coming up in the next
[time=755] several weeks and months.
[time=756] We will be studying the book of 1 Peter, and my sense has been over the last several weeks.
[time=761] Our sense as a leadership has been that there is something very significant for us as a family.
[time=767] Very important for you and I here in this study that we will give ourselves to in the coming weeks.
[time=773] I hope that you'll be here.
[time=774] I want to invite you this morning to do something maybe you've already started.
[time=778] We've mentioned it maybe a couple of times.
[time=780] I want to mention it to you again today.
[time=782] Why don't you do this?
[time=784] Why don't you make a commitment this morning to take the book of 1 Peter and read in it or through it each day as we make our way through this book in the weeks to come.
[time=796] It's a pretty interesting read.
[time=797] It's a fascinating book and it's full of great truth and you could easily sit down and read it in 20, 25 minutes.
[time=803] You could take a chapter a morning.
[time=805] You could go at your own pace.
[time=807] My encouragement to you is this.
[time=809] Make a commitment to him today to spend some time in this book each day so that your mind
[time=816] and your heart is refreshed and reminded of these truths that we'll be going through week after week.
[time=822] And do this.
[time=823] Get a notebook.
[time=824] Get a piece of paper.
[time=825] And as you're making your way through each day as you're reading in 1 Peter, write some notes down.
[time=830] If a question comes to mind, jot it down.
[time=832] If there's something that kind of stands out to you as you read that you're not quite sure about, write it down.
[time=838] My guess is that we'll address it as we study.
[time=840] If we don't, you can ask a good friend.
[time=843] You can come to us.
[time=844] We'll be happy to help you with your questions, but give some thought to that, would you?
[time=848] First Peter, maybe a commitment between you and him to read through day by day as we make our way through the book week by week.
[time=855] Well, if you're going to study first Peter, you have to have a little bit of backdrop.
[time=859] And the backdrop to the book is so very important, especially in this case.
[time=863] The year was AD 64.
[time=865] If you've got your pen, you can start to write some things down here.
[time=869] AD 64, and Nero, the emperor Nero was in charge.
[time=874] He was ruling over Rome at that time, over most of the then-known world, and Nero was
[time=880] a maniacal, crazed, egotistical, evil man.
[time=887] His hatred was great for a lot of things and a lot of people, but there probably wasn't
[time=893] any one particular group that he hated more deeply and passionately than this growing band of Christ followers that were showing up all over the screen in his day.
[time=904] He despised them.
[time=906] Nero also had this insatiable desire to see Rome progressed.
[time=912] He wanted to build more.
[time=914] He wanted to see more.
[time=916] He wanted to expand more, his empire and his nation.
[time=920] So he was a bit deranged, and one of the ways in which he chose to approach building more was he privately, secretly burned about half of Rome to the ground.
[time=932] Now obviously no one knew this at the time.
[time=934] The people who lived in Rome, the folks that called Rome home, the Romans, they were devastated
[time=940] by the fire.
[time=941] They absolutely were heartbroken over the loss of building after building after building.
[time=946] I mean it was absolutely decimated.
[time=949] The fire was immense and in the hearts of the Romans, I mean they began to absolutely
[time=955] cry out for justice.
[time=957] They wanted to know who had burned over half their city and Nero with his deep hatred for
[time=963] Christ followers takes his finger and then just simply points.
[time=968] And in essence says they did it.
[time=972] He blames the first century church.
[time=974] He blames the Christians there in Rome and in the regions kind of scattered around Rome.
[time=980] He blames them and the people of Rome along with the government of Rome now, Nero knew what was going on.
[time=986] They didn't.
[time=987] They just turned and aim and begin an onslaught of brutality and persecution and decimation
[time=996] like nothing you or I have ever seen.
[time=1000] They were mad and Christ followers were blamed and there began the persecution of Nero.
[time=1007] They were burned alive.
[time=1008] They were beheaded.
[time=1009] They were fed to lions.
[time=1010] They were dismembered, killed individually, killed as families, tortured for sport or kept alive for use as slaves.
[time=1020] And this is the backdrop.
[time=1023] In light of unthinkable brutality, the early church in Rome and the church scattered abroad was in need.
[time=1029] They were in desperate need.
[time=1033] They needed to know how in the world they were to respond to this kind of treatment,
[time=1041] to this kind of activity.
[time=1042] They were in need of hope.
[time=1044] They were in need of courage and they were in need of faith.
[time=1047] And so the great church father and leader of that day, this is how he was viewed.
[time=1053] By then he was a revered man.
[time=1056] He was a respected leader.
[time=1058] The great church father and leader of that day responds to their need.
[time=1061] The apostle Peter writes to the church in an effort to reach out and remind them and comfort
[time=1067] them with timely truth.
[time=1068] He writes to paint a picture of a God honoring response to the hostility of evil.
[time=1073] If you want to, if you want to summary statement of where we're going in the weeks and months to come, that's it.
[time=1078] If you want to ask me, "Hey, what's this book really about?" There you have it.
[time=1083] God is going to give you in the days and weeks and months to come a clear picture of a God
[time=1089] honoring response to the hostility of evil.
[time=1094] See Peter knew personally about the schemes of the devil.
[time=1097] He knew Satan wanted the church defeated.
[time=1100] He knew personally that Satan wanted Christ followers left hopeless.
[time=1106] He had been there himself.
[time=1108] And so he writes this amazing letter and in it says in the midst of all you're facing,
[time=1115] hang on.
[time=1117] He reminds them not of a cure or a quick fix.
[time=1121] You know what?
[time=1122] He reminds them of a better day.
[time=1124] He reminds them of a hope that they have within.
[time=1128] And he implores them.
[time=1129] He begs them, encourages them to hang on.
[time=1133] He says, "Remember what is true.
[time=1135] Don't respond with anger, don't become bitter, don't become distant or detached." No, no.
[time=1141] He says, "In Christ you've tasted love, so love.
[time=1145] You've tasted hope, so endure.
[time=1149] You've tasted holiness, so live right in the midst of trial." An entire book written to encourage and remind them and us.
[time=1159] You and I understand that this book is for us today.
[time=1163] We are to take this divinely inspired Word of God, this letter that Peter writes and bring application into the very existence of your life and mine.
[time=1175] It helps us see how we are to respond to the hostility of evil.
[time=1178] And the enemy schemes to ruin, discourage and defeat us.
[time=1182] Now it's important to note at this point that Nero is gone today, correct?
[time=1189] Correct?
[time=1190] Nero is gone.
[time=1192] He's the enemy?
[time=1193] No.
[time=1194] No, my friends, the attack, the schemes, it's really only escalated.
[time=1202] Not a lot of beheadings today, not a lot of families tortured.
[time=1206] There are some still experiencing that, you know, in this world of ours.
[time=1213] But for you and I, it has, for the most part, kind of changed its course, these attacks, whether it's the internet, pornography, failed marriages, a youth culture and decline and
[time=1224] compromise and struggle, sickness, pain, disease.
[time=1229] I mean, he throws at you and I, whatever he can, to move you and I away from the hope that is within us and his hope and his desire is that he would ruin, destroy and defeat
[time=1240] you and us and this effort.
[time=1243] And he's as serious about it today as he's ever been.
[time=1246] And I, for one, would like to know, me personally, because you see, I face the same attacks
[time=1253] you face.
[time=1254] I see the same things you see.
[time=1257] I live in the midst of the very same things you live in the midst of and I need to know
[time=1264] how to respond.
[time=1266] I want to know what kind of road he's called me to walk down in the midst of these schemes and so I want to give myself and I hope you want to give yourself to this study.
[time=1275] Hey, before we jump in to the text, I'd like to give you some background not only on the
[time=1282] setting as we've just done, but I'd like to give you some insight and background on the author himself, if that'd be all right.
[time=1290] I think it's important if I, those that work here will laugh extra hard at this, but it
[time=1297] just to make a point, if I gave you a book today and the book was about how to fix all
[time=1303] of your computer needs, every single one of them, any computer challenges that you might
[time=1311] have.
[time=1312] And I gave you the book and you noticed that the author was me.
[time=1318] You probably wouldn't go too far in your reading.
[time=1323] And I want you to understand today, and it's just so God to do it this way.
[time=1329] My friends Peter, Peter knew something about that which he wrote.
[time=1338] The book stands alone, don't get me wrong, but when you get a glimpse into the heart and life and experience of the man who wrote it, when you come to understand and see that Peter knew a little bit about heartache, he knew what it was like firsthand to experience
[time=1355] the enemy's evil attack, when you come to understand that he knew personally about loss
[time=1362] and personal trials and failure, then you start to see the book, this amazing letter
[time=1369] that we're about to study in a whole new light.
[time=1372] A book that identifies with our struggle by a guy, by an author who identifies with our pain.
[time=1378] And let me give you some background, if I can, on Peter this morning.
[time=1383] You can just write this down, just a couple of things today as we jump into our study.
[time=1387] Some background on Peter himself that I believe will be good for you and I to keep in mind.
[time=1392] Number one, write this down.
[time=1393] He was an ordinary man.
[time=1396] Peter my friends was an ordinary young man, used by God in an extraordinary way.
[time=1404] An ordinary man, used by God in an extraordinary way.
[time=1409] And as we begin our study, we've got to go back to the beginning of this man's ministry and join me if you would in Mark chapter one.
[time=1418] Mark chapter one, verses 16 through 18, an ordinary man used in an extraordinary way.
[time=1426] Mark one, verses 16 to 18, and in honor of God's word, would you stand with me this morning
[time=1432] as I read this for us?
[time=1436] It speaks of Jesus as He's going along the Sea of Galilee, verse 16.
[time=1441] As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon, Peter, and Andrew, the brother
[time=1447] of Simon, casting a net in the sea for they were, say it out loud.
[time=1453] And Jesus said to them, say it out loud, "Follow me, and I will make you become fishers
[time=1461] of men, and immediately, immediately they left their nets and followed Him."
[time=1470] There's a reason why they were so quick to follow, and we'll get to that here in just a moment.
[time=1476] Would you pray with me, Father God, we humbly stand and bow our heads before you and our
[time=1483] hearts today, Father.
[time=1485] We need to hear from you, God, we need to be reminded of what is true.
[time=1490] We need to be convicted, with regard to that which is right.
[time=1495] God, we need to be grown in our faith.
[time=1498] We need our hearts deepened, God, our minds expanded.
[time=1502] We need to better understand you, and that God which you have called us to in this life,
[time=1510] in the everyday of life, and so God with humility and anticipation, we come before you this morning,
[time=1516] praying, God, that your spirit and your word.
[time=1519] We do a transforming work in our lives.
[time=1522] Thank you so very much that we can come here into this place together.
[time=1526] Thank you so very much that we are given the privilege of entering into your presence, and thank you for the life-giving, life-changing word of God.
[time=1537] We say all of this in your son's name, amen.
[time=1541] I've read a lot lately.
[time=1544] I've listened a lot lately to some different teachers and scholars, and as I've listened and as I've read, I've learned some things I've never knew.
[time=1553] It's great to be 41 and still learning, right?
[time=1556] I've learned some things about this scenario that we just saw here in Mark chapter 1.
[time=1562] And let me just say this to you.
[time=1563] Some of this will be review.
[time=1564] We're not going to spend a lot of time here, but we talked briefly about it back when we were talking about Mary and her childhood back at Christmas time.
[time=1572] You got to understand that for a young boy, especially, there was one dream, there was one hope.
[time=1578] A young boy in this first century Jewish culture would have wanted to hopefully someday become
[time=1585] one thing, boys today dream about becoming the next Tiger Woods or an astronaut that
[time=1591] might walk in space, boys today dream about becoming the next Michael Jordan.
[time=1596] Young people today have all kinds of dreams.
[time=1598] And this day, the young boys had one dream, and that was they wanted to be a disciple.
[time=1606] In the rabbinic tradition of that day, their hope and their dream was that somehow, someway,
[time=1612] they could make it to a point where they could, at the end of the day, look into the eye of a rabbi who would look at them and say to them, "I think you have what it takes.
[time=1623] Come, what, follow me." And so they began at the age of five.
[time=1630] We've talked about this.
[time=1631] At the age of five, from five to ten, all these young boys and some girls at that age would be put into what was called Betso far.
[time=1638] Betso far was a high-powered opportunity where the local rabbis would come and help these
[time=1644] kids learn the Torah, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, all five books memorized.
[time=1651] All five books talked about, all five books dialogued, about five to ten-year-olds taking
[time=1657] the Torah and hiding it deep in their hearts, and then being able to talk about it and discourse
[time=1664] about it with, again, a local rabbi, and the ones that were good, the ones that were sharp, the ones that were bright, the best of the best, were allowed to move forward to the next phase.
[time=1675] The ones that weren't were told to go, and even at the age of ten or twelve, begin to learn your family's trade.
[time=1683] They would begin to go and apprentice.
[time=1684] They would begin to go and learn how to do whatever it was Dad did in that day.
[time=1690] The next phase, Bet Talmud, Bet Talmud.
[time=1692] The stakes got a little bit higher, and they would begin to memorize all the way to the end of the Old Testament, now from Genesis all the way through Malachi, all of it, Genesis,
[time=1705] all the way through Malachi, memorized, all of it understood, all of it talked about.
[time=1711] All of it, they were quizzed on.
[time=1713] There was discourse and discussion, and the rabbis would ask, and the students would answer,
[time=1719] and the hope was that in their answering and in their study they might be good enough.
[time=1723] They might be bright enough.
[time=1725] They might be sharp enough to make it to the next third level.
[time=1729] The third level was called Bet Midrash, Bet Midrash, and this is where it got really serious.
[time=1737] You see the best of the best of the best, got asked, invited to move on to Bet Midrash.
[time=1743] The rest were told, "Sorry, go learn your family's trade.
[time=1749] Go begin to do what you're going to do with the rest of your life because it's not going to be this." And so in Bet Midrash they would watch this, they would apply, they would literally make application, they would apply to different, almost like a job.
[time=1764] It was their future, it was the rest of their lives, and they would apply to different rabbis.
[time=1770] There were many rabbis in that day, and they all had different teachings, otherwise known as yolks, and their yolks were complicated and heavy duty and long, and these young men
[time=1785] would give themselves to understanding and learning that rabbi's yoke.
[time=1790] He was just hoping, all of them were hoping, that as they would go and apply to different rabbis, hoping, praying that the rabbi would accept them so that they could become a disciple.
[time=1806] Because it's all they wanted to do, growing up in those days, is have a rabbi look him
[time=1812] in the eye and say, "You know what I think you've got what it takes?
[time=1816] You come and follow me." And so only a few by the end, only a few are invited to come and be a disciple of this
[time=1828] rabbi.
[time=1830] And see, when you learn that, when you understand just that right there, the significance then
[time=1841] of this scene in Mark 1, it was mind-boggling for me the first time I then looked at it
[time=1850] through this new lens.
[time=1854] Jesus walks down the shore, my friends, and Peter and Andrew, and a few verses later,
[time=1862] James and John, are they following a rabbi?
[time=1866] Yes or no?
[time=1867] No.
[time=1868] What are they doing?
[time=1870] They're what?
[time=1871] They're fishing.
[time=1876] And they've probably been fishing for a while.
[time=1881] These guys weren't the best of the best of the best.
[time=1885] These guys were the not so good enoughs.
[time=1891] These were the guys that had been cut.
[time=1897] All they had ever wanted to be were disciples.
[time=1902] And so a rabbi, a new up-and-coming one, comes walking down the beach and he says to them
[time=1908] those two words, those three words they had dreamed of having someone say to them, but
[time=1914] no one had ever said it.
[time=1915] They listened as he said, "Come, follow me," and boom, drop the nets.
[time=1923] Are you kidding me?
[time=1924] I'm on my way a little later than I thought, but somebody said it.
[time=1931] He believed in them.
[time=1933] He wanted them to be with him.
[time=1936] And so they follow, and they follow immediately, and they follow wholeheartedly, ordinary,
[time=1944] or very people, very, very ordinary young men.
[time=1950] Both scholars would put the disciples at that stage of the story at about 18, 19, early
[time=1957] 20s.
[time=1958] Peter may have been a little bit older, but this was not your 18, and yet Christ comes.
[time=1964] The rabbi comes and says, "Follow me," and they do, "ordinary young men, but a relationship
[time=1971] with the Lord and time," and don't miss that, "a relationship with the Lord and time." We always need that time thing.
[time=1979] We always need the experiences that He brings you and I through, a relationship with Him and time, eventually empowers Peter and the others to be used in an extraordinary way.
[time=1993] And they are used in an extraordinary way.
[time=1998] I mean, you can begin to just go through the gospels.
[time=2001] You can begin to make your way through the book of Acts.
[time=2004] I want to draw your attention to Acts chapter 1.
[time=2006] Would you just turn there real quick?
[time=2009] So much in between, right?
[time=2010] But I want to just kind of skip over to Acts 1.
[time=2013] And I want to just show you how this fisherman, this ordinary uneducated guy, remember, now
[time=2020] Peter didn't get, he probably didn't get Bette Midrash.
[time=2024] He probably didn't get Bette Talmud.
[time=2026] He was probably out fishing because he's a real ordinary simple guy, and yet Jesus invests in Him.
[time=2032] He makes a deposit into His life, a relationship with Christ.
[time=2037] Do you hear that?
[time=2038] A relationship with Him and time brings an ordinary man to some extraordinary opportunities.
[time=2047] The book of Acts chapter 1, I'm always amazed by this.
[time=2050] This would just be a few weeks, okay?
[time=2052] This would just be a few weeks after the horrific experience of the crucifixion.
[time=2058] And all that went south there for Peter, especially, but then all that we see Jesus go through, this is a few, several weeks removed.
[time=2067] Look at verse 12, "Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
[time=2074] When they had entered the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying, that is Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the zealot, and Judas the son of James, these all with one mind, were continually devoting themselves to prayer along with the women and Mary, the
[time=2093] mother of Jesus and with His brothers." And at this, I love this, at this time, here you go.
[time=2098] It's time, all right?
[time=2100] Here you go.
[time=2100] At this time, Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, huddled into the upper room
[time=2108] in Jerusalem, a gathering of about 120 persons was there to gather and said, "Breathering
[time=2114] and off he goes." He steps up.
[time=2118] And not only does he step up there, but then shortly thereafter in chapter 2, we see the day of Pentecost when God and His providence brings the gift of the Holy Spirit in a unique and special way, the Spirit descends down and the apostles are touched and they're given
[time=2134] this supernatural ability, this divine enablement to speak and communicate in other languages
[time=2141] and dialects.
[time=2142] It's called the day of Pentecost.
[time=2144] It causes quite a stir and all of Jerusalem begins to come out into the streets and they're yelling and they're screaming and they're questioning and here's this band of Christ followers who just several weeks ago saw something like this, you can imagine what they must
[time=2159] have been feeling.
[time=2160] You can imagine the fear and uncertainty in chapter 2, verse 12, and they all continued
[time=2167] an amazement and great perplexity saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
[time=2173] But others were mocking and saying they are full of sweet wine, but Peter, here you go, but Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, "Men
[time=2184] of Judea and all you who live, all you who live in Jerusalem."
[time=2190] The crowd had gotten quite large, "Let this be known to you and give heed to my words."
[time=2197] And what has initiated there, my friends, is arguably the greatest, clearest, most powerful
[time=2205] sermon ever given.
[time=2208] It is an absolute oratorical masterpiece.
[time=2212] I mean, I'm telling you, you read through this, what Peter does, Peter, this ordinary guy who wasn't good enough, but in relationship with Christ and through time is used by God
[time=2223] in extraordinary ways, he stands in front of the entire city and begins to unfold for
[time=2229] them God's redemptive plan as it's unfolded throughout history.
[time=2234] He goes back into the ages.
[time=2236] He takes him through the whole history of God's people.
[time=2238] He leads him right up to the crucifixion, and in verse 32 says, "This Jesus God raised up again to which we are all witnesses, therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this, which you both see and hear, for it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says, 'The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool
[time=2264] for your feet.' Therefore, Peter concludes, "Let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."
[time=2278] A boldness and a clarity and a conviction.
[time=2282] Most of us ordinary folks just wouldn't have, but you see, that's what God does, and that's
[time=2288] what God did with this ordinary individual who gave himself fully.
[time=2295] Failures and all to be used of God.
[time=2298] He was weak.
[time=2299] Number two, write this down.
[time=2300] He was weak and marked by failure.
[time=2303] You and I need to understand this today.
[time=2305] You and I, as we begin this study, need to be reminded that Peter, the great apostle, was
[time=2311] weak and almost known for his failures, not his successes, yet God in time made him strong
[time=2321] and fruitful.
[time=2323] Don't miss that.
[time=2324] God in time made him strong and fruitful.
[time=2331] Think about this with me.
[time=2333] Have you ever thought about the fact that the Bible doesn't in any way really gloss over people's failures?
[time=2341] I love that about Scripture.
[time=2344] It doesn't hide them from us.
[time=2348] No, we see them up close and personal, and we get the privilege of learning from them.
[time=2353] The biblical drama unfolds with a cast of tainted, fallible, and frankly quite human
[time=2359] characters, our Scripture heroes and heroines possessed great strengths as well as debilitating
[time=2365] weaknesses.
[time=2366] Remember the achievements and the anger of Moses?
[time=2372] The brute strength and sensuality of Samson, the godliness and guile of Jacob?
[time=2379] The blessing and bitterness of Naomi, the wisdom and wickedness of Solomon, our ancestors and the faith were forced to confront their sinful habits, overcome obstacles, and work through personal failures in order to become all that God had called them and created them
[time=2395] to be.
[time=2396] Rarely, though do we find more of a walking contradiction in terms than in Simon Peter
[time=2403] the Rock, as Jesus named him.
[time=2406] He walked on water yet cowered at the sight of a storm.
[time=2411] Peter's passions and quick tongue often got him into trouble.
[time=2415] At times he was astute at other times, obtuse, courageously loyal yet frequently coweredly,
[time=2423] a glowing success, a dismal failure, what a life he lived.
[time=2429] However, when we turn to 1 Peter 1-1, we don't read Peter the man who turned his back
[time=2435] on his best friend.
[time=2436] It doesn't say as 1 Peter 1-1 opens up there in verse 1, it doesn't say Peter the man who denied Christ.
[time=2442] What does it say?
[time=2445] We simply read Peter, what an apostle of Jesus Christ, a phrase kept for the most highly
[time=2455] revered.
[time=2458] My friends, this tainted, fallible human being found love and hope beyond grievous failure.
[time=2466] And he grew from it.
[time=2468] Some of us in the room this morning, some of you sitting here in this room this morning need to be lovingly and gently reminded of that.
[time=2478] I'm going to say that again to you because there are, there's many in the room today,
[time=2484] I would suspect, who would benefit from a timely reminder of that nature.
[time=2491] This tainted, fallible human being found love and hope beyond his grievous failure.
[time=2500] And he grew from it to become the rock, the loyal apostle and faithful follower of Christ.
[time=2510] He was weak and marked by failure, none greater than what we see recorded from the night Jesus
[time=2517] is captured.
[time=2518] Go back to Luke if you would, Luke 22, let's just go back through there and take a look at that, probably without doubt, Peter's darkest hour, this apostle of Christ, this revered
[time=2531] church leader, this father of the New Testament church, he was at one time in the midst of
[time=2539] a very, very, very dark night.
[time=2542] Maybe you've been there.
[time=2543] Luke 22, we'll pick it up in verse 54, "Having arrested him, now they come to the garden,"
[time=2550] right?
[time=2551] Before we read, look up here.
[time=2552] They came to the garden, they track him down, Jesus, that is, the Roman cohort comes.
[time=2557] As they initially make their way towards him, our buddy, Peter's full of bravery and courage, right?
[time=2563] You'll remember he pulls out the sword and goes after the guy's ear.
[time=2566] Well, from that point on, as the narrative progresses, we see that boldness and bravery
[time=2573] fade, watch.
[time=2576] Having arrested him, they led him away and brought him to the house of the high priest, but Peter was what, following at a, what, distance, he's afraid, scared.
[time=2592] After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them and a servant girl seeing him as he sat in the fire light and looking intently at him, said, "This man was with him too," but he denied it, saying,
[time=2607] "Woman, I do not know him." A little later, verse 58, another saw him and said, "You are one of them too," but Peter said, "Man, I am not." After about an hour had passed, another man began to insist saying, "Certainly this man also was with him for he is a Galilean too," but Peter now in verse 60 said, "Man, I do
[time=2630] not know what you were talking about.
[time=2633] In the vernacular of our day, are you kidding me?
[time=2636] I don't even know the man, and by virtue of the denial, an essence was saying, 'And
[time=2642] I don't care.
[time=2645] I don't know him, and I don't care.'" And immediately while he was still speaking, we often hear it portrayed as after he was done.
[time=2655] Isn't it interesting?
[time=2656] Immediately while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
[time=2661] The Lord turned, that always strikes me right there, the Lord turned.
[time=2666] This is all happening in proximity.
[time=2668] This is not different rooms in different parts of the city.
[time=2671] This is in the courtyard.
[time=2672] They're all there.
[time=2673] I mean, it must have just been bedlam.
[time=2676] And in the midst of all that's transpiring, the Lord turns and looked at Peter.
[time=2681] And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had told him before a rooster crows today, "You will deny me three times," and he went out and wept bitterly.
[time=2692] And I just want to remind you here, just from what we've even learned this morning, okay?
[time=2696] Why people, why did he weep so bitterly?
[time=2701] Why was the sense of failure and loss so great, my friends?
[time=2705] What was it about what he just did there that was so devastating to him?
[time=2714] All he ever wanted to be was a what?
[time=2718] A disciple.
[time=2719] All he ever wanted someone to say to him was, "Come what?
[time=2723] Follow me." And someone had all his buddies that had grown up hoping to be connected to some rabbi.
[time=2729] See, he had been connected with the rabbi, and the rabbi had looked in his ordinary eyes
[time=2735] and said, "Come follow me, I believe in you, and this is where it ends for now.
[time=2741] This is where it brings him." He had finally become a disciple, he had finally been asked to follow, and now he fails.
[time=2752] He fails miserably.
[time=2756] And where to go?
[time=2758] Where to go from there?
[time=2761] We got a room full this morning of people who have failed miserably.
[time=2768] You brave enough to say amen.
[time=2772] And you and I, my friends, you and I need to be real clear on what that means and doesn't
[time=2779] mean about you and I.
[time=2783] We need to be very clear on what our failure means and what it doesn't mean as far as the love that our father has for each of us and the opportunities that may lie beyond
[time=2794] our failure.
[time=2797] Well, I asked the guys if we could just take a few minutes and kind of come back at this message and as we come to the end of the message, I wanted to just set it up for you if I could in this way.
[time=2809] As you look back on the life and ministry of Peter, as we've done today, you realize,
[time=2815] like I realize, that his life and ministry was full of failure, failure again and again
[time=2824] and again, and you know, you and I can identify with that, at least I know I can.
[time=2829] I understand and I know what it means to fall short.
[time=2834] And as we think about what took place in Luke 22 here towards the end of our time together as we looked at him denying the Lord those three times, I mean, I'm struck by the fact
[time=2845] that this guy wanted so desperately to please the Lord and yet he so tragically fell short.
[time=2855] And I think you and I understand what that means.
[time=2858] And I know what it feels like when I fall short and I want to make sure you understand today that there is on the other side of our failure, a great opportunity to be used
[time=2870] of God in an extraordinary way and I want to illustrate that for you today by giving
[time=2876] you the chance to watch a video.
[time=2878] We have over the last several years come to really appreciate the folks at numa.com.
[time=2885] Numa is an organization that is now in the process of producing short films in essence,
[time=2892] video segments that capture in a very creative and straightforward way, biblical truth.
[time=2900] These short snippets, these short films, bring to light through illustration and analogy the
[time=2907] life-changing truth of God's word and they do it in a remarkable way.
[time=2912] And so I want you to watch this short film from numa and I want you to allow it to communicate
[time=2918] to you this life-changing truth that though we fail and though there is sin and though
[time=2924] you and I need to repent and confess that sin, there is on the other side of that a loving
[time=2930] God, a loving God whose love is so great, whose love is so deep and whose commitment
[time=2937] to us is so big that no matter where we've been and no matter what we've done he is willing
[time=2943] just like he was with Peter.
[time=2945] He is willing to embrace us yet again and to move us down a road of service and usefulness
[time=2952] and worship that is so very encouraging.
[time=2956] I know many of you need to be encouraged as it relates to life and ministry after failure
[time=2962] and so watch this, allow it to minister to your heart and encourage your soul and thank
[time=2968] you so much for tuning in.
[time=2982] I'm on my kitchen table we have this metal tin bowl receptacle thing where we keep
[time=3012] all those things that don't seem to go anywhere else you have one of these places in your house it's maybe a shelf or a drawer it's that place where you put all those possessions that are just half no homes where they end up and so at any one time you know it's got like a shoelace and it's got a key to you have no idea what and you know maybe some rubber, stick a dynamite
[time=3032] or something.
[time=3033] I don't know.
[time=3034] So anyway a few days ago my wife Kristen and I were clean up the kitchen we're picking things up and I noticed this little white ball in the metal bowl and I'm struck with
[time=3043] the fact that I've never seen it before and so I turned to Kristen and I say like hey where does white ball come from where did you get it she says I have no idea never seen it before.
[time=3052] Now our boys are here so I said you guys where does white ball come from I haven't seen it before and the one son my younger son he says what I don't know I've never seen it and my older son says it's just the strangest thing I don't know I don't know where it came from do you know where it came from and then he like keeps going in the same voice he's he's like a sister strangest thing I mean this little white ball it appeared out of nowhere who knows where it came from and Kristen and I look at each other and we have this look between us like do you know who this boy is I mean for a few brief moments he's some
[time=3085] other kid and he just keeps going with these bizarre gestures it's like he's been possessed by the spirit of Urkel or something and for a few brief moments he's this other boy you know I don't know who it came from but I mean it's just like a you know it's just a little white ball it's Kristen and I look at each other like this is not that big of a deal so
[time=3107] a couple days later my wife is home with the boys and she's in one room and they're playing another room and and she hears this ruckus and the two of them run into the room where she's at and the younger son is crying and he's insisting that his brother hit him my
[time=3120] older son is going I didn't hit him I don't know what you're talking about it's a strangest thing it's the weirdest thing I didn't hit him and he's going on with tears streaming down his face is going no he hit me in my older son is going no I don't know what you talk about it's the strangest thing it's the weirdest thing and then Kristen just says to him kind of like you don't know where the white ball came from and he just freezes like
[time=3150] the technical legal word here is busted you know that moment like when your junk catches
[time=3157] up to you it's like maybe not that day maybe not the next day maybe not for a while but
[time=3165] given enough time it always finds us like there's this great phrase wherever you go there you are it's written in the bible and we'll pick a lations like don't be misled
[time=3177] no one makes a fool out of God whatever we plan on harvesting it's like one way or
[time=3183] another given enough time our sins find us out it always catches up with us doesn't
[time=3189] it so my boy stands there in front of his mom throws it and then he turns and runs upstairs
[time=3199] and then he turns and then he turns and then he turns and then he turns and then he turns
[time=3223] because sometimes it's easier to run upstairs isn't it then to face the truth now this
[time=3241] whole time I've even been there I'm coming home I call Kristen and she tells me this whole story I'm driving along thinking what am I supposed to do I get home I know I should do something but I had no idea what to do and so I get home and Kristen tells me that she hasn't heard a sound from him upstairs the whole time so I go upstairs and I go check
[time=3264] in his room and he's not there so I go and I check in his brother's room and he's not
[time=3270] there and I check the bathroom and he's not there which leaves only one option our bedroom
[time=3280] and so I go and I stand in the doorway of our bedroom and I look in and there in the middle
[time=3289] of our bed under the covers is a lump the size and shape of my boy and I mean at this
[time=3298] point he's been under there at like two hours I mean it must be so hot he must be so miserable
[time=3306] and he can even breathe under there I feel like I should get a snorkel and he just must be miserable and I start thinking about all the immense he's gonna need to make to his
[time=3318] mom and to his brother and to me and then I think about whoever he took the white ball from we're gonna we're gonna have to call him and at some point go over there he's gonna need to take the white ball back and he's gonna need to apologize and and I stand in the doorway of the bedroom and I think about my boy and all of his shame the kind of shame
[time=3341] that he would hide under the covers for that long and so I go over and I sit down on the
[time=3349] edge of the bed and I pull the covers back a little bit and the first thing I see is just
[time=3355] this soaking wet hair like he's been underwater and so I pull the covers slowly back until
[time=3365] he's just lying there all curled up with his eyes closed and he doesn't move it's like
[time=3375] he has this choice like does he continue you know does he grab the covers and pull them
[time=3381] back over his head and keep hiding or does he just let himself lie in there totally exposed
[time=3387] and vulnerable so I sit on the edge of the bed and I say to him there's nothing you could
[time=3394] ever do that would make me love you less and then slowly he sits up and he opens his eyes
[time=3405] and he plants the soaking wet head right in the middle of my formerly dry shirt and he
[time=3413] wraps his little wet wall arms around me and he just starts sobbing and he cries and cries
[time=3424] and cries and he's so sorry and so I sit on the edge of the bed holding my boy with the
[time=3434] covers pulled back repeating nothing you could ever do to make me love you less nothing you
[time=3441] could ever do do you realize that do you know that nothing you could ever do make me love
[time=3449] you less mean whatever you've done wherever you will do I mean God loves you and God always
[time=3456] has and you can't change that because sometimes the white wall seems like everything doesn't
[time=3464] it's like how am I ever going to get away from it and so we have no idea what to do with our shame so we run upstairs and we hide under the covers and we keep hiding because we don't we don't know where to come what to do maybe you're like yeah when you don't
[time=3479] understand what I've done or if you only you know that like it says in the book of romance
[time=3485] chapter in the Bible there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God and Jesus
[time=3491] nothing nothing nothing can separate you so may you stop hiding under the covers may
[time=3504] you let God pull the covers back may you embrace him me whole life become a response to the
[time=3513] truth that you've always been long and you always will be loved and may you know may you
[time=3521] know deep in the depths of your soul there's nothing you could ever do to make him love
[time=3529] you last nothing you could ever do to make us nothing you could ever do to make it
[time=3559] you.
[time=3589] a lot of people are going to be like that.
[time=3591] I'm going to be like that.
