[time=426] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=430] And it is great to be with you again.
[time=432] I want to tell you something that I'm sure won't come as a surprise to most of you.
[time=437] I love what I get to do here at Black Hawk.
[time=440] I am so grateful for this life that God has given me.
[time=444] I'm so thankful for what this ministry is about.
[time=447] I'm so grateful that I get to share in it with the team of people that God has surrounded me with.
[time=453] It is absolutely amazing, each and every day, to be in the midst of something where you see God transforming people's lives.
[time=461] And that I get to do this is something that I am so very, very thankful for.
[time=467] I'm also thankful for the fact that as we do what we do here, we are trying our best to be balanced.
[time=474] There's a balance to this ministry that we're shooting for.
[time=478] We don't always attain it.
[time=480] But there's a balance, a ministry balance, a theological balance, even if you will.
[time=486] And what I mean by that is this.
[time=488] What you're about to see this morning is the beginning message in our journey through the Book of 1 Peter.
[time=495] It was so great to be teaching this past week with Steve and Mitchell, the three of us together.
[time=501] And in this first passage we come to in 1 Peter, we see the issue of election come to the surface.
[time=509] Peter talks about how God, before the foundations of the world, he foreknew, he before the foundations of the world, he chose those who would be his.
[time=521] He elected the believers into a saving relationship with him.
[time=526] He knew how all of that would go.
[time=528] Not only did he know it, but he predetermined and chose people.
[time=534] God did.
[time=536] Well, in John 3, 16, it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son who ever believes in him should be saved." John 3, 16 clearly communicates that it is your willingness or your readiness and mind to choose, to believe, to surrender our hearts and lives.
[time=557] In 2 Peter, chapter 3, it talks about how God is slow.
[time=563] He is slow in his judgment, not wishing that any would perish.
[time=568] If he elected everybody, how is it that he's not wanting any to perish?
[time=574] And if he foreknew and chose me before the foundation, and that sealed my salvation, why does John 3, 16 say, "That if I believe, I'll be saved." See, there can be a tension.
[time=587] And what I want you to know is that here at Black Hawk, we're committed to both.
[time=592] And see some folks say, "Well, you can't be." And see some folks have gone and postured themselves on the opposite ends of the theological spectrum.
[time=600] And it's either this or it's this.
[time=602] Well, you know what?
[time=603] God's word clearly teaches election.
[time=606] And God's word clearly teaches that you and I have a choice to make.
[time=610] And I don't understand, we don't understand completely how it all works, but we're willing to live in that balance, in that tension.
[time=618] And this morning you're going to hear us celebrate and bask in the truth of the fact that he chose me.
[time=626] And you, if you know him, others of you are watching and you don't know him yet, you're still on a journey trying to figure out what it means to really be in a life-saving, eternity-altering relationship with the Lord.
[time=639] And I am so thankful that you're listening, so thankful that you're asking questions, so thankful that you're reading books or listening to CDs that you never used to care about.
[time=648] And if there's anything we can do to help, we want to do that.
[time=652] Continue to watch the broadcast or better yet come and visit us live and in person.
[time=657] Sunday mornings at 9 o'clock, Sunday mornings at 10.45, and Wednesday evenings, our common ground worship service begins at 6.45.
[time=666] Thank you so much for watching.
[time=668] We're praying for you and we're thankful that you're on the journey you are.
[time=672] God bless you and have a great week.

[time=993] â™ª The song there, I don't know if you recognize the song in the video there.
[time=1001] It's a short little piece done by Mercy Me.
[time=1004] You'll find it tucked away on the very last track on their safely home, the second of their, I believe, three CDs.
[time=1012] I love what it says. They wonder why.
[time=1016] We do the things we do. How is it? How is it that people can stand and shout? How is it that Christ followers can stand and sing when there's not much to sing about?
[time=1028] When there's not much to be happy about, when things aren't going well, when tragedy seems to be so very close, how is it that people can stand and express a deep love and trust in the face of such hostility? These are the folks that Peter writes to. We talked about that last week. A scattered bunch of folks who the whole country was after Nero had blamed them for the burning of Rome and now the hostility and the danger and the torment and the persecution now begins to move toward an unbelievable proportion.
[time=1064] Families are being tortured. Husbands taken away from their wives.
[time=1068] People burned at the stake and yet they stood. They stood with unbelievable boldness and courage. And how in the world, here's the question, how in the world were they able to do that and how in the world are you and I in the midst of what we face? How are we to respond?
[time=1092] In this book, this amazing book gives us insight into that very thing. And we are so looking forward to this time, so very thankful for the opportunity to look into the pages of Scripture and to study the book of 1 Peter.
[time=1108] And I'm so thankful that we get to start that this morning. I'm so thankful to be here with our other two teaching pastors, Steve Longbreak and Dr. Mitchell Cruz. And somebody asked me a few weeks ago they said, "Hey, Purd Man, do you like still own a tie?" And I said, "I don't know.
[time=1124] I'll go home and check." So I went home and I checked and I actually have one.
[time=1128] So we decided we'd actually wear coats and ties today.
[time=1132] And so we're all dressed up and thankful to be here with you and really, really think. You can applaud the ties if you'd like, it's no problem.
[time=1140] You won't see them for a while, so I'll plot away.
[time=1144] We are, I'm so grateful for these two. So thankful for what they bring to my life. So thankful for the friendship.
[time=1152] And so thankful for what they bring to this family and the ministry that God has given them. And so we begin this morning when holiness meets hostility and this morning's title is a chosen community and not in order, but in honor of God's Word. Let me have you stand.
[time=1172] I believe we had some lights on. Did you get a car? I think I left it down on my, let me see if I've got it written over here.
[time=1180] There was a car with its lights on and I just remembered, sorry, not very spiritual, a blue T bird.
[time=1188] That's spiritual. A blue T bird with lights on, no other info.
[time=1196] Blue T bird with lights on, no other info. In honor of God, let's stand here and let me read to you first Peter chapter 1 verses 1 and 2. A chosen community.
[time=1208] Here we go. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to those who reside as aliens scattered throughout Pontius, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. Who are what? Say it out loud.
[time=1224] Chosen. Chosen. Who are chosen. This community of God, this family of God, this faithful band of Christ followers now scattered throughout the region.
[time=1236] Peter reminds them right out of the gate that they are a chosen people. How? According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood, made grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure. Let's pray.
[time=1260] Our Father, God in heaven, we come before you this morning so looking forward to this time.
[time=1268] This time this morning, Lord, and God in the days to come, if it be your will, we are so looking forward to what you would have for us in this study. God, we believe your word changes people. God, we believe your word is life giving. God, we believe the truth that we find here is able to give direction and purpose to life. God, I pray that every person in this room in the days and weeks and months to come, as we give ourselves to this study God, that we would open our hearts and minds with great humility and expectation. God, that you and your word and your spirit would do things in us, show us things about you.
[time=1308] God, reveal things about ourselves. God, teach us new things that we've never seen. Remind us of old truth that maybe we've wandered away from. God, we pray this morning as we begin and embark upon this study that we would come before you so very willing for you to do through your scripture, through your word, your life transforming, life changing work. We come before you in humility today realizing that you are God and then you're grace and mercy and only by your grace and mercy.
[time=1344] Are we able to be here this morning and only hear present but hear with this unspeakable privilege and opportunity to look into the depths and the truths of your word so God be at work. Open our hearts and minds to what you would have for us in your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1364] You can be seated. Well, we're going to get started here in these first couple of verses and the way I want to get us going is just by mentioning this to you.
[time=1372] There is something about being part of a family.
[time=1380] Many of you in the room this morning have had wonderful family experiences. Others in the room this morning that that avenue has been full of heartache and challenge for you but nonetheless there resides I think in each and every one of us the understanding that there is something about family. There is something about being part of something special. There is something about the camaraderie. There is something about the love. There is something about the relationship. There is something about being in the family. It's the way God designed it that is so very very special. And as these people here these scattered believers are facing all of the persecution and torment that they're facing God right out of the gate here through the pen of Peter reminds them, hey folks I know it's fiery these days. I know what you're facing is difficult. I know the challenges are immense but you are part of a family. You are a chosen community. Part of my family a family of God. A family, a team if you will that in the end wins.
[time=1448] A team, a family of people, a chosen community who in the end though you may face a fiery ordeal now for a time. He says you know what? You're mine and in being mine I love you and I will protect you and I will guide you and I will hold you and there will be a day when we will be together. This chosen community.
[time=1472] And so he reminds them and he reminds you and I right at the beginning here that we are chosen. Part of an amazing family a chosen community and how is it that ones place in this chosen community comes to pass?
[time=1488] How is it that this amazing thing takes place? We want to ask that question and do our best to answer it right out of the gate this morning here with you as we begin our study. How is it that one comes into the family of God? How is it that we can experience the peace and the joy and the comfort of being part of the family of God knowing that whatever we might face in the end is. Well he explains it to us right here in verse 2. You and I being part of the family of God is a result of or takes place according to the foreknowledge of God by the sanctifying work of the Spirit. For what reason?
[time=1532] For what purpose to obey Jesus Christ?
[time=1536] And those are our three points. Our three points of emphasis this morning and I would invite you to listen. I would invite you to get out of pen. I would invite you to turn the pages of your Bible and begin to see more clearly how it is that this privileged position of being a member of the family of God how it all came to be. It began with and Steve's going to come and start us out. It began with the foreknowledge of God the Father. The foreknowledge of God the Father is how it all began. Listening to him talk about the fact that where his reminded me of Isaiah 43 it's one of my very favorite passages. It says this "But now thus says the Lord your creator O Jacob, and he who formed you O Israel, do not fear for I have redeemed you. I have called you by name.
[time=1596] You are mine were his." According to the foreknowledge of God the Father were his. He knew we were his before we were born.
[time=1608] And a lot of times what happens is the Scripture teaches us that that's true and it's in several places we'll look at several of those today.
[time=1620] And it also teaches that we have choice that we have freedom to respond. All those things are true.
[time=1628] And it's really hard for us to exist together in the body of Christ because we have a tendency to lean toward one of those making us comfortable more so than the other.
[time=1640] And actually denominations get started over those things because people struggle so with the fact that God is sovereign and that people aren't living like he's sovereign. That God has foreknowledge and people aren't living like he, that God has chosen and people aren't living like he's chosen. They're living like it's all up to them. And so it makes it really difficult for people who lean toward that being which they are comforted. And then there are the other folks.
[time=1672] It's all about me getting people to Christ. I've got to put another notch on my belt here.
[time=1676] And I've got to lead them to the Lord. It's about me doing evangelism.
[time=1680] The Bible says both those things are really true.
[time=1684] Jews were more comfortable with that than Greeks.
[time=1688] That there would be two things that were really true and seemed opposite each other. And they could live there. And I just want to encourage it to live there.
[time=1696] I want to encourage there are lots of those in the Scripture.
[time=1700] Those things toward which we get drawn and we feel more comfortable when we're with the people that agree with us on those things. And I think God in his sovereignty and his incredible ability to know what's best for us made it possible for us to exist together in a community and live with the tension that that brings.
[time=1720] And balance comes through that.
[time=1724] But today, today we're going to really enjoy his foreknowledge. His having chosen us. He's redeemed you. You're his. He's called you by name.
[time=1740] So it says we are chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father.
[time=1748] We're also going to hear about the Holy Spirit in this sermon and about the Son and the three persons having different roles in the person of God.
[time=1756] It's fun to think about. It's comforting. The word foreknowledge, the Greek word is prognosis. Probably heard that word before, haven't you?
[time=1768] We have an English word that's just specifically drawn from that.
[time=1772] prognosis. It really means eternal predetermined intention.
[time=1780] God was very intentional in his predetermined will to grab us and draw us into eternity.
[time=1788] And today what we want to do is really enjoy that.
[time=1792] The truth is he has predetermined very intentionally to draw us to himself.
[time=1800] And let's just kind of bask in that. It is about him drawing us.
[time=1808] In Acts 2, this word shows up again foreknowledge.
[time=1816] In Acts 2 verses 22 and 23, read those along with me.
[time=1820] Men of Israel, listen to these words.
[time=1824] Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through him in your midst.
[time=1832] Just as you yourselves know, this man delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God. You nailed to a cross by the hands of Godless men and put him to death.
[time=1848] The foreknowledge of God predetermined the fact that Jesus was going to be nailed on a cross for this foreknown person, Steve, in order that the blood of Christ would pay for my sin.
[time=1864] And I'm thankful. When you really know that when you really understand that, it drives you to your knees and humility and then you want to express back to him whatever it is he calls you to express and Mitchell will talk to us about that. Then in Ephesians 1, a really common passage, a familiar passage about election in Ephesians 1 verses 3 through the first part of verse 6 it says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ. Just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we would be holy and blameless before him, in love he predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself according to the kind intention of his will, to be the praise of the glory of his grace. Aren't you just amazed at his grace? That he was extend that kind of love to us and give us the opportunity he glorifies us through the blood of Christ that we can then glorify him in a life on this earth. Amazing.
[time=1936] And then I'll close with our friend Kathy McCrady's one of her favorite passages is Romans 8 and it's not going to be on the screen you'll have to turn there if you have your Bible.
[time=1948] It's Romans 8 and a familiar verse 28 starts the passage but I want you to just listen to these words and enjoy the reality that they're true for you.
[time=1960] If you know Christ is your savior you can experience this today.
[time=1964] Romans 8, verse 28.
[time=1968] And we know that God causes all things
[time=1976] to work together for good to those who love God to those who are called according to his purpose.
[time=1984] For whom he for knew that's us.
[time=1992] He also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren and whom he predestined these he also called and whom he called these he also justified and whom he justified these he also glorified. He has glorified us and we can glorify him with our lives.
[time=2020] So Peter right from the beginning he writes and he communicates with these dear people he says in essence you know what I realize you're getting killed.
[time=2032] I mean I realize it's tough I realize what you're going through is some of the most horrendous stuff you could have ever imagined but I want to remind you here at the beginning he says you know what you're chosen you're part of the family of God and you being part of that family is all due to the gracious loving foreknowledge of God who brought salvation to you.
[time=2056] Now he goes on and says by the sanctifying work of the spirit you see it there back in first Peter 1-2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by the sanctifying work of the spirit okay get out your pins and write these three things down would you? Very important to take note of this a little bit of help on your study of the Holy Spirit and a lot of help I hope as it relates to our passage this morning three arenas of sanctifying activity three arenas of the Holy Spirit engaging in what we'll call this morning sanctifying activity there are three ways in which the spirit does this important for you to understand each of the three okay and I'm going to throw some big words at you and we'll just break it down and hopefully you'll understand it better as we make our way through number one write this down there is the spirits efficacious work there is the spirits efficacious work just write that down E F F E C A C I O U S is efficacious work you know what this is the efficacious work of the spirit is that first time the spirit did this to you do you remember that?
[time=2132] Do you remember where you were? Do you remember what was going on the first time and it was just different something was going on and all of a sudden you felt like hello and it was like a hook got set those of you that fish you know it was like a hook got set and all of a sudden whoa here we go he's bringing me in the efficacious work of the spirit is the spirit of God drawing you to salvation I can remember being 20 years old at the frat house at Fresno State I had spent three years as far away from God as you can even imagine you don't want to imagine how far away from God I got but I'll tell you what it was like all of a sudden in like about a two week span tapes that I was chucking in the garbage I was all of a sudden now listening to it two in the morning books I had no desire to read just months before books that I would I would mock people who were reading these books I had these books under my cover with a flashlight going oh my gosh this is amazing I was having conversations with people I was asking questions there was all of a sudden this movement in my spirit toward that which was true in writing good and the Holy Spirit was doing his efficacious work in me do you remember that?
[time=2216] There might be some of you in the room here this morning and you're you're not like looking back on it you're experiencing it even as we speak he is drawing you to himself he is moving you toward faith the efficacious work of the spirit you can write it down next to efficacious work this right down he draws us he draws us toward God secondly his his soteriological work I know I know big word just write it down his soteriological work soteriology is the study of salvation when you go to seminary and you learn all these things as you take your theology course you study about soteriology the study of salvation and the spirit of God is very much at work not only in drawing us to faith but actually in working out that transaction he is involved in the saving itself our passage today in 1 Peter 1 really emphasizes this component of the spirit's activity and we'll come back to that but there is a third one too there is his progressive work the progressive work of the Holy Spirit not only does he draw us he saves us and thirdly write it down he grows us that's the work of the spirit the sanctifying work of the spirit sanctify sanctify the word in the Greek is hagiasmo hagiasmo it means to set apart it means to bring out from it means to consecrate to set aside see you and I were we were lost we were here we were in sin darkened in our understanding because his consecrating sanctifying work he moves you and I out of that into a relationship with God and then he begins to grow us he begins to teach us he begins to convict us he begins to take you and I through the process of becoming in time more and more like who Christ his progressive work I look at myself today 41 years of age I look back 10 years ago at 31
[time=2350] I am so I am so grateful I don't know about you when I look back 10 years ago where I was who I was how I lived choices I made the way I thought you know what it's different today am I there no I'm not there yet there's going to be glory someday and that's when I'll be perfect and like him but the progressive work of the spirit when you and I live in cooperation with that he grows us he matures us his efficacious work his soteriological work and his progressive work look at 1 Corinthians 9 1 Corinthians excuse me 1 Corinthians 6 verses 9 to 11 I want to take you back to his soteriological work the spirit of God's active participation in the process of saving us it's amazing what he does, God brings salvation to us the holy spirit in essence carries it out 1 Corinthians 6 9 to 11 and then we'll also go to Titus 3 5 it says or do you not know Paul writes at the church of Corinth that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God do not be deceived neither is nor idolaters nor adulterers nor a feminine nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God those folks won't inherit the kingdom of God because those folks rejected the gift of Christ those folks chose to remain in darkness all of those phrases we just read through when you look in the Greek there that would be individuals continually being characterized by a progressive ongoing unrepentant pattern in those involvements and you see folks who fully surrender their hearts and lives to Christ don't go on in ongoing hard-hearted unrepentant patterns of those things Paul just mentioned such were some of you
[time=2484] such were some of us right yeah right
[time=2490] yeah but what but you were washed but you were sanctified there it is set apart but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the what say it spirit of our God Titus 3-5 you can look that up write it down Titus 3-5 we see the same truth we see the same great truth having to do with the work of the Holy Spirit he saved us it says there not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness but according to his mercy by the washing of regeneration by the washing of being made new and renewing the regeneration and renewing that takes place by the who by the Holy Spirit he God saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit Peter says people people hang on you're a chosen member of an amazing community of Christ followers and there will be a day when we will all be together and whatever you might face face it and face it well and know this you are chosen by the foreknowledge of God by the sanctifying work of the Spirit and I want you to remember today I want you in this room today to be reminded of what the sanctifying work of the spirit has done write these four things down would you you can write this down before we get going right down Ephesians 2 1-3 everybody write it down Ephesians 2 1-3 and I would invite you tonight or this afternoon at some point today to sit down and open that up and read that to yourself read that to your spouse read that to your family talk about it and thank God that he did this through the Holy Spirit in your life in mind the sanctifying work of the spirit he has set us apart right from number one from sin to God be reminded of this great truth this morning he has set you apart from sin to God you and I were lost you and I were absolutely given to and under the control of in the darkness of sin and he sets us apart to God number two he sets us apart from that darkness to light I hear it all the time I hear folks talk about the clarity that comes in knowing Christ the clarity and the freedom and the light that comes see folks have become so accustomed to the darkness of being far away from God when the sanctifying work of the spirit takes place and you and I come into a life-changing relationship with the Father there is a there is a brightness of life there is a direction that is now seen he moves you out of darkness into clarity do you remember that do you continue to sense that and see that the sanctifying work of the spirit setting us apart from unbelief to faith from unbelief to faith at the beginning of Ephesians 2 you'll remember and you'll read it tonight I hope as you take some time we were dead it says we were dead in our trespasses and sin there was no there was no trust in him there was no belief in him there was no commitment to him we were absolutely thoroughly dead and he moves us from that state of unbelief to faith and fourthly write this down and I can remember this many of you in the room I'm sure can remember this as well he moves us from loving sin to loving righteousness and it's just the honest truth that in our darkness that in our unbelief my friends and I do remember what it was like I loved sin. I hate saying that today you maybe do as well but you remember that don't you when we were controlled by him given to caught in our trespasses we loved it we couldn't wait to get back to it and I say that to you this morning to in no way glorify it I'm just struck again when I think about the love I had for it and and where the spirit of God and his sanctifying work has brought me today you know what I hate it today I hate it do I still do it yes or no yes lady first dollar right down here dear dear old lady said no I said yes I do I do and I hate it and I'm so thankful that I hate it because you hear me say it all the time I love righteousness I say it to you this way I say it all the time what is right true and good that's what we love that's what we move toward that is what fills our hearts because of the sanctifying work of God in the family my friends by the foreknowledge of God by the sanctifying work of the spirit so that we can obey the Lord Jesus Christ Mitch is going to come and help you understand and see that a little bit better that you may obey that you may obey Jesus Christ by the sprinkling of his blood to obey means to listen not to hear but to listen and we don't listen to someone until we trust someone so write that down trust precedes obedience Trust precedes obedience Paul said this he bookends Romans with this concept he calls it the obedience of faith the obedience that flows from trust the eliciting that flows from first trusting in someone and that someone is Christ to obey means first that I'll trust but he talks about the sprinkling of the blood this is a not so subtle reference to what many call the first worship service a first recorded worship service and God and Moses they have the Israelites about two million of them out in the desert he's going to create a new people and let's just look at it it's Exodus 24 verses 7 and 8 then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people and they said all that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will be obedient we will listen because we trust God and then it goes on to say so Moses took the blood he had killed an animal there was a blood sacrifice the blood was in the bowls on the side of the altar it was on the altar and this was symbolic of life being in the blood and remission of sins being in the shedding of blood all a symbol looking forward to Christ and he said behold the blood of the covenant for a chosen community which the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words and he sprinkled the blood on the people as a symbol of God's payment years later in Christ so listen you got to trust Christ to obey Christ you have to trust the work of the Holy Spirit that Kelly talked about in order to obey Christ and we are designed as a covenant community a chosen community to obey Jesus Christ not just as Savior but as Lord and when George Barna shows that the statistics of the church the chosen community has a higher divorce rate than those outside that's not obeying Christ and now many of you have been divorced and I'm not condemning you today because look what's followed by the obedience to Christ it's the sprinkling of his blood you say Mitch my obedience always fall short I know I know but see that little phrase the sprinkling of his blood it means atonement write that down atonement means one meant exactly as it spelled to be made one with God that's huge because of the atonement of another Jesus Christ we obey and we listen because we trust and we trust write this down because we first love see obedience is an act of the will it's always an act of the will it's a choice to surrender my will to someone else that's love that's agape that's self sacrificial love and not because of there's anything good in me but because God loved us first the foreknowledge of the father Peter's very Jewish and knowledge in the Old Testament means to connect with the innermost part of another to connect with the innermost part of another it says that Adam knew same root word knew his wife and she can see doesn't mean sex but there's this connection of this intimacy of foreknowledge and this connection of this intimacy with God because God loved us first he goes first and we respond and we obey and you might say why why why a chosen community why obey why listen why first trust why love what's God's design
[time=3176] turn to 2nd Corinthians 5
[time=3182] verse begin with verse 18 it says now all these things are from God who reconciled this is like peace Paul says grace and peace be with you who reconciled us to himself Peter does through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation namely that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself those who are opposed to him not counting their trespasses against them he is committed to us a chosen community the word of reconciliation therefore we are ambassadors for Christ as though God were making an appeal through us we beg you on behalf of Christ be reconciled to God he made him who knew no sin to be sinned or the payment of sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of God in him people when we obey Jesus Christ as Lord when we trust in his spirit in the atonement of another when we love God those outside the kingdom of God are drawn to Jesus Christ and God makes his appeal to a lost world through a loving community a chosen community that reveals the community of the very heart of God does that make sense he does it so that we as a community will obey him will trust him will love him so that those outside will love him trust him and obey him so there you see the there you see the work of the three the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and Peter right from the beginning of his letter and right here at the outset of our study we're reminded that in the midst of our fiery ordeal in the midst of the challenges that you and I face we have the privilege of being a part of something so very special not because of anything we've done initially but because of what God Father has done his foreknowledge the sanctifying work of the Spirit so that we could be an obedient people now I want to just I want to invite you to come back next week the progression as we make our way through these five chapters is really amazing we've all been studying and reading ahead I can't wait for you to see what is there I love it how he starts but boy I tell you what he just keeps going verses three to nine are just amazing and we'll come back and begin that study next week but I want to say this to you before we go there may be somebody here this morning and you haven't been tortured no one has removed your family from you your husband didn't get burned at the stake last week your kids haven't been taken from you you're not on the verge of being sold into slavery like these folks were but you know what I know there are folks in the room this morning and you're facing it there are things that are transpiring in your life there are things that God has allowed that leave you today tired confused hurting frustrated maybe just in need of a loving reminder and we would love to offer that to you this morning so I'm going to ask you to stand if you would would you do that and I'm going to pray and then as I pray and as we conclude Steve and I and Mitch are going to be right down here in front any other pastors or elders that would care to come down and help us out you're welcome to do so but we want to give you the opportunity and please take us up on this we would love to just pray with you just for a moment we'd love to remind you of what is true we'd love to stand next to you and let you know that you are loved we would love to pray for whatever might need to be prayed for anything that's burdening you any trial or difficulty you're facing let us share in that with you and after I pray just make your way on down either of the aisles will be down here there will be others here as well we would love to pray for you as you head back into your day and your week why don't you bow your heads Father we stand before you this morning a thankful people thankful that we're in knowing you those of us in the room here this morning that know you that have given our hearts and lives completely to you in response to your saving work God we are so grateful that we are a part of this community this family God that you have put together and God I pray as we leave this place that we would act like it that we would live like it that we would choose and decide like it that we would love our spouses and care for our children and conduct ourselves in the workplace God and face that which comes our way as the people consecrated set apart and given to you and we'll need help and so God we ask for that that strength and courage and peace of heart that is needed to live each day each moment in submission and in devotion and in surrender to you and so God be with us as we go thank you for these folks who are here today a part of this family thank you for what you've allowed us to taste and be a part of here in this time bring us back together again soon if that be your will for it's in your son's name we pray amen
