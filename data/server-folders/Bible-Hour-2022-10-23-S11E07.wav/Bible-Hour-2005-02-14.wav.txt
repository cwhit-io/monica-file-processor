[time=60] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Black Hawk Ministries. I want to thank you for joining us this morning and invite you to attend this Sunday night at the Fort Wayne Memorial Coliseum, an event called Reach For More.
[time=78] We have just concluded about 30 convocations throughout the Fort Wayne area, middle school and high schools.
[time=85] And we've invited students to come to an event where they can reach for more.
[time=90] It's at the Fort Wayne Coliseum tonight, 6 p.m. Laquita Garth will be speaking. She's runner up Miss Black America and she'll be speaking on abstinence.
[time=100] Dana Scott will be speaking. She's sister of Rachel Scott who was murdered at Columbine and it is one of the most riveting talks your student or you will ever hear in your life.
[time=112] And then we have T-Bone, a Christian rapper. So it's really going to be a neat event.
[time=117] We expect about 5,000 students from all over the area. And perhaps you've seen it on a television station or heard it on a radio station, but it's this Sunday night.
[time=127] And here's a little bit about what you're going to see.
[time=130] Reach For More is coming to Fort Wayne's Memorial Coliseum Sunday, February 20th at 6 p.m.
[time=136] Featuring T-Bone, you think sex is going to give you the type of intimacy that my grandparents have?
[time=144] And Dana Scott, who's sister Rachel, was shot at Columbine.
[time=148] The leader of the Truth Diamond, Colder at Byer.
[time=150] Reach For More, February 20th, 6 p.m. at Memorial Coliseum, admission is free.
[time=155] So please join us at the Coliseum tonight for Reach For More is bring as many students with you as you can.
[time=161] What you're about to see is a message from our series entitled when holiness meets hostility.
[time=169] When holiness meets hostility. It's a verse by verse study of the letter of 1 Peter.
[time=175] And I just want to ask you a question that I asked the congregation.
[time=179] Is there anything in your home or at your workplace that you would like to be restored to new?
[time=189] Is there anything at your home or workplace and it's old and you'd like to be restored to new?
[time=194] What about your body? Is there anything old on that you'd like to have restored to new?
[time=199] Maybe you have. What about a relationship?
[time=203] Is there an old relationship that you would like to have restored to new?
[time=208] And then really literally the heart of the matter is what about your soul?
[time=214] Is there something old inside your soul, the very core of your being, that you would like to have restored to new?
[time=223] It's probably an old sin pattern of some kind. Some kind of sin pattern that is rooted in you desiring life apart from God.
[time=232] You know, what is that? If you can kind of get that to the forefront of your mind that will help you make this message meaningful to your own life.
[time=243] Thank you so much for joining us and we look forward to seeing you next week.
[time=247] And also remember that Wednesday nights at 6.45, 8.15 pm is our Wednesday night worship service called Common Ground.
[time=254] And we hope to see you there too. Thank you.
[time=257] We're going to continue to worship together the choirs.
[time=259] Going to sing a song for you and then Mitch is going to come and lead us in worship through the teaching of the word.
[time=265] Before the choir sings though, we've asked one of our members to kind of share a little bit of her story
[time=271] and a little bit of what's happened to her and her family and what makes this song in particular so special to them.
[time=277] So take a look at the screens and watch her story before we sing.
[time=283] Ten years ago this May we had a son that passed away when he was only three weeks old.
[time=289] He was born 14 weeks early and at a very short life lived three weeks.
[time=294] And when we were preparing the funeral for Drake, our son, one of the songs that we picked was the choir number that they're going to be singing called My Tribute.
[time=305] And we knew from the moment that we found out that I was pregnant that God had his hand in it.
[time=313] I had a very difficult pregnancy and medically speaking our son should not have even made it to be born alive.
[time=321] And he did, he lived three weeks, a miraculous three weeks, how God just laid before us, his life, all that he had been doing the whole time.
[time=335] His health was amazing for this three weeks until he got the infection that took his life and we knew that we needed to somehow express to God how grateful we were
[time=350] that we had been given this incredible, incredible gift.
[time=354] And we had remembered a song that we both knew growing up and it was the song My Tribute.
[time=360] And the words in it start out, "How can I give thanks for something so incredible that we so do not deserve?"
[time=370] And that was the song that touched us the most, that was most meaningful to us at the time.
[time=377] Through all of the pregnancy, his life, watching him pass away and just expressing in some small way how thankful and how grateful we were to God that we had the opportunity to have a son for three weeks.
[time=395] And through the years, the song has become even more meaningful with the birth of our three daughters.
[time=403] Because the circumstances surrounding our son's birth and death led us to pursue options that we could actually carry almost full-term three daughters that would not have been possible had we not known some of the things that transpired through our sons.
[time=424] Birth and through the pregnancy that we had with him.
[time=428] And that song is still very meaningful to us today.
[time=434] Even ten years later, it gets me choked up just hearing the words in the song that led us to our knees ten years ago with our son and holding him and watching him struggle and experiencing him rapping him.
[time=453] Rapping his tiny little finger around my finger and being able to experience the miracle that God brought into our life even though it was such heartache and sorrow when he passed away that he was able to work in us, the song that we could say thank you to him in return.
[time=483] [MUSIC]
[time=615] How can I say thanks for the things he's done with his blood.
[time=626] [MUSIC]
[time=781] Why do we do the things we do.
[time=787] How can we sing.
[time=790] When there's no reason to, how do we smile.
[time=797] When there's not much to smile about.
[time=800] When the world is down.
[time=804] So are we to stand and shout.
[time=807] And they wonder why.
[time=811] We do the things we do.
[time=815] It's all because of this.
[time=822] We taste it over, taste it over, taste it over, taste it over, taste it over.
[time=829] It's all because of this.
[time=835] We taste it over, taste it over, taste it over, taste it over again.
[time=843] â™ª
[time=864] Well, I want to ask you a question.
[time=866] I want to share the answer with the person next to you.
[time=870] Do you have anything old in your house or where you work that you would like to have restored to new.
[time=882] Is there anything old, spouses don't count.
[time=885] My goodness.
[time=887] Is there anything old in your house or where you work that you would like to have restored to new.
[time=894] Then tell the person next to you, go.
[time=910] What are you coming up with?
[time=914] Let me get a little more personal.
[time=918] Is there anything old on your body you would like to have restored?
[time=924] Don't tell the person next to you.
[time=928] Is there an old relationship that you would like restored to new.
[time=936] And what about your soul?
[time=941] Is there anything old in your soul that you would like restored to new.
[time=948] Any old sin pattern, whether it be lust, envy, greed, gossip, whatever it is.
[time=959] Is there something old in your soul that you would like to have restored to new.
[time=967] An old sin pattern.
[time=969] I'm ashamed to say that about 25 years ago I was eligible for a no cussing contest.
[time=977] I was at a basketball camp with the other teammates for my basketball team.
[time=982] And we were realizing that we were letting it fly a little too much.
[time=985] So we came up with this idea of appealing to our competitive nature.
[time=990] Let's have a no cussing contest and whoever cusses at least wins and everybody else has to buy him the pizza at the end of the week.
[time=998] Well, we took the challenge.
[time=1001] And a friend of mine decided he was going to be the monitor, the score keeper.
[time=1006] And so he'd come and he'd watch our games.
[time=1009] We weren't on the same team.
[time=1010] He'd watch our games and make sure we weren't letting something fly if we made a mistake.
[time=1014] Came to me one time and we were just having a normal conversation.
[time=1017] All of a sudden he goes whoops, you scored.
[time=1020] So he's watching, he's watching.
[time=1021] All of a sudden one day the guy who's monitoring the contest misses a few shots in a row.
[time=1027] And it starts coming out.
[time=1030] You know?
[time=1032] And I said, "Wait, stop!
[time=1035] Stop!
[time=1036] You're going to lose the contest!" He rips his shirt, he takes his ten bucks and he throws it down and says, "I don't care, I'm out!"
[time=1047] And you know, that little story is what we do with the old sin patterns in our soul.
[time=1059] We either say, "I'll restore myself," appealing to our competitive nature.
[time=1066] Or we say, "I'm out." No one can restore this on this side.
[time=1074] I will have it all the time on this side.
[time=1080] What sin contests are you eligible for today?
[time=1086] What old sin pattern have you held on to?
[time=1091] I wish I could tell you that that was the worst of my sin patterns.
[time=1096] But it wasn't. Today we're going to learn about the restore, about living hope.
[time=1104] Confident assurance of life abundant and eternal in Christ.
[time=1110] The restore, living hope that the old can be made new.
[time=1117] And it comes from fully surrendering our lives to the restore, who makes the old new.
[time=1126] Would you please stand and we're going to read our passage today, which is 1 Peter 1 verses 3 through 9.
[time=1133] This is the Thanksgiving passage of his letter.
[time=1136] All letters had that.
[time=1138] It's all one sentence all the way through verse 12.
[time=1140] We're not going that far today.
[time=1142] All one sentence.
[time=1143] You grammar people ought to take note on that.
[time=1146] All one sentence.
[time=1147] And he learned to pray from a book called the 18 benedictions.
[time=1152] That's how they were taught.
[time=1154] And this is a celebration to God for what he has done.
[time=1158] Okay?
[time=1159] So let's read it.
[time=1160] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1165] In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection
[time=1175] of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[time=1178] And into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade, kept in heaven for you, who through
[time=1188] faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be
[time=1197] revealed in the last time.
[time=1199] In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief
[time=1206] in all kinds of trials.
[time=1209] These have come so that your faith of greater, worth and gold, which perishes even though
[time=1215] refined by fire, may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus
[time=1224] Christ is revealed.
[time=1227] Though you have not seen him, you love him.
[time=1230] And even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible
[time=1236] and glorious joy for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
[time=1246] Let's pray.
[time=1249] And now God may the words be yours and not mine, a living hope full surrender to the restore,
[time=1262] convict each soul here today.
[time=1267] And God I speak as one along the same journey.
[time=1273] And pray these things in Jesus' name, amen, may be seated.
[time=1281] We're going to see that living hope fully surrenders three things.
[time=1290] Living hope fully surrenders three things.
[time=1294] Living, zoey, spiritual, abundant, eternal life, hope, confident assurance of being in Christ
[time=1302] knowing that life now and for eternity, surrenders three things.
[time=1306] And the first one, write it down.
[time=1309] Living hope fully surrenders my old life, my old life.
[time=1318] Fully surrenders my old life of sin, of desiring life apart from God into the hands of the
[time=1326] restore for an inheritance, the word inheritance there means present in future.
[time=1333] It's how it's used in the day, it's how it's used in the Bible.
[time=1337] I have it now in abundant life.
[time=1340] I have it in the future in eternal life and inheritance of living hope, confident assurance
[time=1350] of life, of being restored in Christ.
[time=1355] Let's look at what Ephesians 4, 22 through 24 says.
[time=1360] You were taught with regard to your former way of life, the old life, to put off your old
[time=1367] self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires to be made new in the attitude of
[time=1378] minds or your soul, and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness
[time=1387] and holiness that only comes from Jesus Christ.
[time=1392] Resurrection, inheritance, future salvation are all terms that Jews referred to for the
[time=1401] last days, the last times, and what's important about that here is that Peter is saying the
[time=1411] Messiah has come.
[time=1414] Jesus Christ was God in the flesh.
[time=1418] He came and He lived a perfect life and He died on a cross bearing the old sins of all.
[time=1433] And He resurrected conquering the old, conquering sin and death.
[time=1441] And He's giving you new birth into a living hope.
[time=1446] You see, there were pagan religions that said you could have new birth, you could have new life, but it depends on you and your works.
[time=1457] That's true in the day.
[time=1459] Same today, people say that.
[time=1462] But Peter says, no, it's based on the works of another.
[time=1469] It's based on the restore, and we need to fully surrender our old life into the hands of the
[time=1477] restore.
[time=1478] Why?
[time=1479] Because of God's great mercy and resurrecting Christ from the dead.
[time=1485] God's great mercy, mercy, not getting what we deserved for our sins.
[time=1494] Mercy is the grid by which Jesus Christ, the restore, chooses His projects.
[time=1512] Let's look at Matthew 9, 13.
[time=1516] Jesus says, but go and learn what this means.
[time=1519] I desire mercy, not sacrifice.
[time=1524] Don't try to restore yourself for I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.
[time=1535] And so how do I want you to surrender your old life to the restore, your old life of sin?
[time=1547] I want you to write this down, this is exactly what I want you to do.
[time=1550] I want you to write down, I can't, you can.
[time=1556] I can't, you can, write it down.
[time=1561] How do I surrender my old life?
[time=1564] I can't, you can.
[time=1569] We say, I can't restore my own life.
[time=1573] Jesus Christ, the restore, you can.
[time=1576] I can't pay for the penalty of my sin.
[time=1580] Jesus Christ, the restore, you can.
[time=1582] You conquered the old.
[time=1585] I can't be Lord of my own life and be free from the power of sin, but through you can.
[time=1591] Through Christ, you can.
[time=1595] We need to admit that outside of Christ we are unrestored sinners.
[time=1602] Now there's a couple other permutations that mean something quite different I can do with those words.
[time=1608] And it's interesting, our surveys tell us that there probably are in this room anywhere from 100 to 250 people who think that you are outside of a loving, saving relationship
[time=1622] with Jesus Christ.
[time=1624] And it's because you're saying one or two things.
[time=1627] You're either saying, I can restore my life, Christ, you can't.
[time=1633] Look at me.
[time=1635] I'm honest, I pay my taxes, I don't cheat on my wife.
[time=1639] I can restore myself, you can't.
[time=1644] Or you're saying this, not only I can't, but Christ, you can't.
[time=1652] You don't know how bad I am.
[time=1654] You don't know what I've done.
[time=1657] You don't know how bad it is.
[time=1660] Nobody can restore me from this sin pattern.
[time=1665] But God's mercy is available for the sin patterns in our souls to be restored only in
[time=1673] Christ the restore and Jesus gave us the model on how to respond to His mercy.
[time=1679] It's going to come on the screens.
[time=1681] Luke 18, 13, Dave Walters preached on this parable, but the tax collector stood up, stood
[time=1687] at a distance showing his broken heart.
[time=1692] He would not even look up to heaven, but he beat his breasts, beat his breasts and said,
[time=1698] God have mercy on me, a sinner.
[time=1703] I can't restore my own life.
[time=1707] You can.
[time=1710] I want to give you a picture.
[time=1712] I have a little illustration here.
[time=1713] It's going to come on the screen.
[time=1715] It's a 1908 Auburn.
[time=1719] That's the factory photo from the archives at the Auburn Cored Dusselberg Museum.
[time=1723] We've been so gracious to let us have these photos.
[time=1728] And there's what it looked like new.
[time=1730] You might want to compare that to God's design.
[time=1733] There's original design he had for us.
[time=1736] But here's what it looked like after a tornado had wiped out a barn and it set in for years.
[time=1746] And the beams had fallen in on it and it's pretty much all there, but it's unrestored.
[time=1754] And one day the family who had it said to the Auburn Cored Dusselberg Museum here, take it.
[time=1762] What are we going to do with it?
[time=1765] And that picture I'm using right now for you to imagine the picture of your soul when you surrender the old life to Christ the restore.
[time=1781] Now again, it's bad, it's rusty, it's corroded.
[time=1786] You know, what are those sin patterns in your life?
[time=1791] But if you haven't fully surrendered your life to the restore, what about today?
[time=1796] What about saying I can't?
[time=1798] You can.
[time=1800] Not saying I can't, you can't, you don't know how bad I am and there's no way you can do it.
[time=1806] And not saying I can God, I can restore myself, you can't, I'm pretty good.
[time=1812] But what if you would just come today with your soul sin and all and said,
[time=1819] Jesus Christ the restore, I can't restore my own life, you can.
[time=1827] We see here that living hope, confident assurance of life, abundant eternal in Christ, fully surrenders my old life.
[time=1839] And maybe that's you today and you're ready to say to God, I can't, you can.
[time=1848] But second, we'll see that living hope fully surrenders, write this down, my sins piece by piece.
[time=1858] My sins piece by piece, I surrender them to the restore as the trials in my life reveal those old sin patterns.
[time=1870] Let's look at verses six through seven.
[time=1875] In this, let me just point out what this is, in this, that's the coming salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
[time=1883] Peter believed, he says later that these are the last times the Messiah has come, but when he's the second coming, when he comes in that last time.
[time=1892] In this, because you're shielded by God's power through your full surrender, that was a Roman idea that Rome could do that.
[time=1898] He's saying, this is a different deal, and your inheritance that you're losing, see they were losing, the early Christians were losing their physical inheritance on earth.
[time=1907] They were losing their properties that they inherited from their parents because of their full surrender of their old life.
[time=1913] So he says, in this, you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
[time=1923] Well, these have come so that your faith of greater worth than gold, the most precious commodity in the marketplace there, which perishes even though refined by fire, may be proved genuine.
[time=1936] And may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed, living hope fully surrenders my old life and my sins piece by piece.
[time=1951] Why? So that my full surrender or my faith might be proved or approved genuine, real.
[time=1962] Everybody will take God in good times, but what about the bad?
[time=1968] And then Peter uses this imagery that used throughout the Bible of a refiner or a restorer of metal.
[time=1976] See, the way that works is refinement brings heat to the metal, let's say gold.
[time=1983] And as that heat gets hotter and hotter, the impurities come to the top.
[time=1991] So as our trials, the heat of our trials come around us, our old sin patterns of our soul will start rising to the top.
[time=2007] When Peter wrote this, it might have been a great temptation to go back, to go back to the old life.
[time=2015] Because they had many social pressures beyond what Cali has talked about, they also had pressures of being unprofessional in business and being accused of that
[time=2025] because they wouldn't go to the guild meetings that were at the pagan temples.
[time=2030] That's kind of got a link to today.
[time=2033] If I want to live out a relationship with God in the marketplace, some people don't like that.
[time=2037] They were pressured and criticized and ostracized for not being family-oriented because all the family, all the family, events were at pagan temples
[time=2050] and they didn't go. Early Christians did that together.
[time=2054] It can be familiar today.
[time=2056] They were criticized as being unpatriotic because they wouldn't bow down to Caesar who called themselves divine.
[time=2065] And so Peter says these heat of these trials will bring the impurities in your soul to the top.
[time=2074] And guess what?
[time=2076] The biggest, baddest impurities come out towards the end when the fire is at its hottest.
[time=2086] And the refiner molds and shapes and refines and brings impurities out of the metal until he sees his reflection in the metal.
[time=2103] This Christ the restore is refining us amidst the trials and the temptations of life, bringing the impurities out the old sim patterns in our souls
[time=2117] so that we will be proved genuine and authentic and have his heart so that we will reflect him.
[time=2128] And you say, well, how do you want me to do that?
[time=2130] How do you want me to surrender my sins piece by piece?
[time=2134] Write this down.
[time=2136] Confess.
[time=2140] Confess in communion and community.
[time=2146] Confess in communion with God and in community with others.
[time=2152] Vertical and horizontal confession. Confess means to agree with God from his perspective that the sins are there,
[time=2160] to see that they're there, that the impurities have risen to the top and now I'm going to let the refiner have them.
[time=2166] Look what 1 John 1 9 says.
[time=2169] If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us, restore us from all unrighteousness.
[time=2183] Confess your sins to God, piece by piece as they come up through the trials of life.
[time=2192] I've held on to sin patterns and I've not confessed them to God. See, He already knows them.
[time=2199] But sometimes you just feel like you've got this safe place to harbor this desire apart from God.
[time=2206] And you don't even want to give it to Him because you know if you do, He's going to do that.
[time=2210] I'm challenging today. Don't do what I've made mistakes doing. Don't hold on to it.
[time=2215] Confess it immediately to God and let Him cleanse you and remove the impurities and forgive you and restore your soul.
[time=2224] Second, I want you to confess horizontally.
[time=2228] Now there are some things that will just be between you and God, but I think generally through most of the time there needs to be flesh on God.
[time=2237] You need to go find someone you trust. Write this down. You're committing today that you're going to go find someone you trust.
[time=2243] And you're going to take that impurity in your soul, that old, and you're going to give it to the restore, but you're going to confess it to someone you trust.
[time=2253] This isn't my idea. James 5, 16.
[time=2258] Therefore confess your sins to each other in the chosen community and pray for each other so that you may be healed or restored.
[time=2271] The prayer of a righteous man who has the righteousness of Christ because He's fully surrendered to him is powerful and effective.
[time=2279] Confess your sins piece by piece as they come up with the refiners fire with the trials of life and surrender them.
[time=2293] I want to give you a caution. Typically don't cross gender lines. Opens up too much intimacy that can lead to other sins.
[time=2305] All right? Another caution. Don't ever, don't ever confess your sins of desire for someone else's spouse to that woman or that man.
[time=2319] Don't ever do that. That's a backhanded way of saying I'm willing to sin further. Don't do that.
[time=2329] Let's look at this illustration, this picture.
[time=2335] It's an amazing story here. The Auburn Court Dusabroop Museum had this car on display for a long time.
[time=2342] And a group of volunteers came together in community and volunteered their time and said let's restore it piece by piece.
[time=2352] And they did. Almost all genuine authentic parts. But it had to be restored piece by piece in community.
[time=2363] It's in our community here that you can be restored piece by piece by confessing your sins to God and in community to another person.
[time=2378] Living hope, confident assurance of life abundant and eternal in Christ. Fully surrenders my old life, my old life of sin.
[time=2391] Fully surrenders it into the hands of the restore. And then we go on a pattern of fully surrendering our sins piece by piece as a refiner's fire brings them about.
[time=2404] Living hope, third, write this down. Fully surrenders my worship. My worship. Let's look at what Peter writes.
[time=2417] Verses 8 and 9, though you have not seen him. You love him, it's Jesus Christ. And even though you don't see him now, you believe in him or fully surrender to him.
[time=2430] Same word is faith, believe in faith are the same words and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy for you are receiving the goal or the outcome of your faith, of your full surrender.
[time=2444] The salvation or the restoration of your souls. He's the restore, worship him. It says love the invisible Christ.
[time=2456] Believe or fully surrender to the invisible Christ. Because when you do that, the invisible becomes visible.
[time=2467] I was talking to Steve Longbreak about this this week. And he said, you know what I was told? If what's your worship? What should give your attention to?
[time=2478] Because we're worship beings, right? We're going to worship somebody or something, right? That's how we're designed.
[time=2486] And he said, I was told that if you can see it and if you can hold it in your hands, then it's not Jesus Christ.
[time=2495] And when I ask you today, is the worship you surrender your life to? Can you see it? Can you hold it in your hands? If you can, it's not Jesus Christ.
[time=2509] Look what 2 Corinthians 4, 18 says.
[time=2514] So we fix our eyes, not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary and what is unseen is eternal.
[time=2528] The gold is going to burn up and go away. But fully surrendered lives and Jesus Christ have living hope that will never perish, never fade, never spoil.
[time=2541] And that's where the value is. Worship him with your life. Love him. Believe him. Fully surrender your worship to him. Trust him.
[time=2552] He is the restore. Why? He tells us, verse 9, for the salvation or the restoration of your souls.
[time=2567] On this side of heaven, on this side of heaven, we will surrender our sins piece by piece.
[time=2577] On this side of heaven, we worship God for taking those impurities and refining them.
[time=2584] And we're going to do something else with it. I want to show you.
[time=2592] You know, David knew a lot about this. King David.
[time=2597] And he says in the 23rd Psalm, verse 3.
[time=2608] He restores my soul.
[time=2618] Jesus Christ is the restore of your soul.
[time=2623] I want to show you something. Here's to the 1908 Auburn, fully restored.
[time=2632] Isn't that beautiful? It's beautiful. Look at it. Paint's all shiny, brass is shiny, leather's perfect, runs beautifully, but I want to ask you some questions.
[time=2650] Will it ever get a paint chip? Will the rubber on the tires ever wear? Say it louder.
[time=2660] Yes, they will. Will the interior ever get kind of crumbly? Maybe tear if somebody sits in it just wrong.
[time=2669] Well, the engine someday needs more fluids of some kind or needs some work. Yes or no?
[time=2680] On this side of heaven, as a saved individual, you are going to need to be in the restoration process again and again and again.
[time=2694] Now you're made new. You're new creation. You've got a new heart. You've got a new Lord heading in a new direction.
[time=2703] But piece by piece, through the refinement, we've got to surrender those to God in confessing those sins, vertically and horizontally.
[time=2713] And here's how, I want you to write this down. Here's how I want you to fully surrender your worship to Christ, the restore.
[time=2723] I want you to go find someone who has similar sin patterns that Christ has restored in you and minister to them.
[time=2734] I want you to go find someone who's caught in similar sin patterns that you have been restored from and go minister to them.
[time=2748] This isn't my idea, this is God's. Kelly brought this verse out. I want to bring it back. It's Luke 21 verses 31 and 32.
[time=2759] Luke 21 verses 31 and 32. It might be Luke 22. It's Luke 22 verse 31 and 32. Simon Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.
[time=2776] But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith or your full surrender may not fail.
[time=2785] And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers. Go minister to them because they're going to have the same refinement process.
[time=2795] Church! Jesus Christ prayed for every single person in this room today. He prayed for you.
[time=2804] And He said when you surrender your sin patterns to me, when you confess them to me, when you confess them horizontally,
[time=2811] when you agree with me that they exist, and you let me refine you and shape you like me, and when you let me restore your soul, go!
[time=2819] And help restore others with the same sin patterns. I've never seen this quite like I saw Wednesday night when Robert Rogers came.
[time=2836] We were alone and back. And I told him what I was talking about today. And I said, I just want to know if you believe this, it looks like maybe you're doing it with your life.
[time=2849] Have you thought about it or intentional about it? And he says, let me tell you something. He said, I have one hope.
[time=2857] You see, Robert lost his wife and his four children in a flash flood. A 500-year rain came and it blew out in bankments, 10,000-pound embankments like they were toothpicks.
[time=2871] And what was a creek became a raging river. And any car that would come up there was just tossed away into a river of death.
[time=2881] He says, Mitch, I started singing, Lord, I lift your name on high as the water came up just in seconds, almost to neck level of my kids.
[time=2891] I didn't want him to be scared. He said, I saw that nothing good was going to happen, so I kicked out the window and I kicked it out.
[time=2899] He said, the water was at the top and only three of us, four of us, made it out. He's two oldest children, his wife and Robert.
[time=2912] Well, everyone drowned, but Robert. Robert Rogers went back to work as an engineer. See, he loved God and he worshiped God. He lived a life of worship, of ministering to others.
[time=2926] But he couldn't focus. And he said, I felt called by God and says, people were calling me. They're saying, come share your story.
[time=2934] He said, it hurts so bad. He said, but I just felt called by God to offer the restore's hope to those who are hurting and need him.
[time=2946] And he says, so I just worship God and let people know that there's only one hope. There's only one living hope.
[time=2956] And it's being in Christ, fully surrendered my old life, my sins piece by piece and my worship to him because he is the restore and he is the only one who will restore Robert Rogers with his family.
[time=2972] He is the only one who will restore Angela Nichols with her son. Then he is the only one who will restore your soul, Jesus Christ.
[time=2988] I want to ask you today, maybe you're outside of a fully surrendered relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2999] Would you surrender your old life to him today?
[time=3007] Would you say, I can't, you can? Because you're saying one or two things. You're either saying, I can't God and you can't. You don't know how bad it is.
[time=3020] Or you're saying, I can't, you can't, or you're saying, I can. You can't. I'm pretty good. I got things worked out. I'm doing well.
[time=3037] Would you consider today fully surrendering your old life and admit like that first picture of the Auburn automobile from 1908 unrestored that you're a basket case in your soul that you fall short of the righteousness of God?
[time=3055] Others of you. Would you today make a commitment to fully surrender your sins piece by piece through confession, vertically to God, and horizontally to someone you trust?
[time=3072] Will you make that commitment today to go find someone and agree with God with the sin patterns of your life and allow him to take those away and restore your soul?
[time=3088] At church. Would you commit today to love and believe fully surrender to the invisible Jesus Christ making invisible by going and ministering to someone else who has the sin patterns that Christ is restoring or has restored in you?
[time=3115] Maybe you've had an abortion and you can go minister to a girl or girls who are thinking about it.
[time=3125] Maybe you gossiped a lot and you can go help somebody, not gossip.
[time=3134] Maybe it's been infidelity and you can go help someone, get restored out of infidelity.
[time=3145] Maybe it's greed and you can go help someone, get out of greed.
[time=3152] Maybe it's abuse of the Internet and you can go help somebody, get out of the abuse of the Internet.
[time=3161] Would you commit today to let the restore use you to restore those far from God?
[time=3171] Would you? We're going to give you a chance to do so. Jesus Christ is our only hope.
[time=3181] He is the restore. And living hope, confident assurance, confident assurance of abundant life now, any eternal life on the other side is only available by full surrender to him.
[time=3200] My old life, I can't God you can. I can't restore my life you can. My sins piece by piece.
[time=3208] Here they are. I can't you can confessing them vertically and horizontally to another and then worshiping God by investing in others.
[time=3216] Only Jesus Christ is our hope. Praise God, Peter says. Praise God. He's making the old new. Praise God. He's a restore.
[time=3226] He restores my soul because if it weren't for him, we would be lost. We would be unrestored. Praise God for Jesus Christ.
[time=3237] I'm asked the team to come up. Jesus said, if anyone is in me, these fully surrendered His life to me, the restore, He is a new creation, the oldest past and the new is come.
[time=3254] We have a new heart. We have a new Lord. We're on a new journey. Jesus' closest scripture was saying, I have made and in making all things new.
[time=3271] On this side, on this side, we're going to be in that process, but praise God. On the other side, we'll be united with families and we'll be free.
[time=3285] We'll be free from not only the penalty and the power of sin, but then the presence of sin. We're going to sing a song. Praise God for that future day.
[time=3296] While we do, I want you to consider what it is God wants you to do. Is today the day, February 13th, 2005, the day that you fully surrender your old life to Him, is today the day.
[time=3313] God, I can't. You can't have mercy on me as sinner. Is today the day that you commit and go find someone you trust and say, I'm confessing my sins. I've confessed them to God. He's forgiven me, but I need to confess them to you.
[time=3329] Is today the day that you need to commit to let the restore use your life, to go restore others who have similar sin patterns that you hadn't got restoring you from?
[time=3339] I want you to think about that. Think about what He's saying to you as they sing the song.
[time=3359] Some day our pain will be no more. Some day our tears will fade away. Some day we'll see our Lord and save your face to face.
[time=3385] Some day we'll rest from all our peoples. Some day we'll see His smile. Some day He'll look us in the eyes and say, welcome home my child.
[time=3410] Praise God, our God. All that's wrong will be made of. How we love for the day.
[time=3428] Every wounded soul will be made of. So that's what we'll appear with a mighty voice. Like we're all ready within the paradise. Praise God, all high. Praise God.
[time=3457] Some day we'll walk beside the Father. Some day we'll rest at His feet. Some day our trials will all be over. We'll be completely free.
[time=3482] Praise God, our God. All that's wrong will be made of. How we love for the day. Every wounded soul will be made of. So that's what we'll appear with a mighty voice.
[time=3511] Like we're all ready within the paradise. Praise God, all high. Praise God.
[time=3529] Praise God, all high. All that's wrong will be made of. How we love for the day. Every wounded soul will be made of.
[time=3555] So that's what we'll appear with a mighty voice. Like we're all ready within the paradise. Praise God.
[time=3585] So that's what we're all ready within the paradise.
[time=3613] Praise God.
