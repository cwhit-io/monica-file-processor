[time=252] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=269] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we are so thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=275] I want to tell you about our ongoing study in first Peter.
[time=279] The message that you'll hear today is a message we've entitled, "What's So Great About Salvation?"
[time=286] And I want you to think about this with me before you actually see the message.
[time=290] This past week at the Memorial Coliseum, there was an event entitled, "Reach For More."
[time=296] It was an enormous, county-wide outreach event that was aimed at reaching high school and middle school students all over this area.
[time=304] As I heard about what happened at that night at the Coliseum, one of my friends who was there said to me that it would appear as if maybe anywhere from four to six hundred students
[time=317] made decisions that night for Christ.
[time=321] That four to six hundred students, somewhere in that range, came forward.
[time=326] And for whatever reason, God was moving in their heart.
[time=330] The message that they heard connected, the need that they felt, their realization of their sin,
[time=336] there were somewhere between four and six hundred kids that made commitments, first-time commitments to Jesus Christ.
[time=343] They got saved.
[time=346] And my buddy and I had this conversation, and he tells me four to six hundred kids possibly had been saved,
[time=353] and we went on to talk about something else, and I was thankful for what I heard, but I didn't think about it again the rest of the day.
[time=359] Now, here's the truth.
[time=362] The truth of the matter is that if you were in a conversation, or I was in a conversation,
[time=368] and the story got told that four to six hundred high school students had been taken hostage in a local school,
[time=376] that terrorists had come in, that rifles were drawn, that the explosives were present, and that four to six hundred high school kids were about to be killed.
[time=385] But through the work of someone from the federal government or some SWAT team guy that came in and intervened,
[time=393] what was going to be a certain disaster was alleviated, and those four to six hundred kids were saved from certain death.
[time=403] You and I would be riveted, glued to the storyteller or the newscast.
[time=411] And I don't know if you get where I'm going there, but you know it's an amazing thing to me how spiritual salvation,
[time=420] which has to do with all of eternity, it doesn't seem to grab us, it doesn't seem to capture us,
[time=429] it doesn't seem to, for some I think, and I'll include myself, there's times where I feel like my view of salvation,
[time=436] and what it really means has somehow been diminished.
[time=440] And I would get more excited about four to six hundred kids who physically had been saved,
[time=446] and I understand that because nobody wants four to six hundred kids to be killed, I'm with you on that.
[time=452] But the difference between physical salvation and spiritual salvation, it's significant.
[time=459] And one is, in the end, all right, in the end, much more important.
[time=465] And so I want you to think about that today as you watch the broadcast.
[time=469] I want you to think about being saved, and I want you to think about the salvation that is offered in Jesus Christ,
[time=477] and I hope you have that.
[time=479] I hope you have a relationship with Him.
[time=481] I hope you can today as you watch this, watch with the assurance that your heart and soul presently and forever has been saved.
[time=492] If it hasn't, our hope and prayer is that this time together that we have today will further you on that journey.
[time=499] If you have questions, please ask. We'd love to help.
[time=503] If you are saved as you listen today, be so very, very thankful that He did what He did when He came and saved you and me through the work of His Son on the cross.
[time=517] God bless you, and I hope you enjoy today's broadcast.
[time=533] [MUSIC]
[time=564] Well, good morning.
[time=567] We're thankful that you're here and really, really looking forward to the time together.
[time=573] From what we've heard, from what I've heard, from what others have heard, maybe you've stopped us in the hall or written us a note, but so far.
[time=580] Our study of 1 Peter has been encouraging.
[time=584] To many of you, a reminder to many of you, even though we've just been going a few weeks here.
[time=590] For others of you, I'm hearing that it's bringing new learning to your life and new insights to your faith.
[time=597] For many of you, a young faith, and for that, we are very, very grateful.
[time=602] Question for you.
[time=604] Have you ever been in a situation in your life?
[time=607] Have you ever been when you were young, middle-aged, older, and no matter, was there ever a circumstance that you found yourself in when your life was saved?
[time=618] When your life got saved, have you ever been in a situation?
[time=625] May have been very traumatic, may have been years ago.
[time=630] Was there a situation you found yourself in when your life got saved?
[time=636] And I wonder, as I ask that question, how many of you, as you answered it mentally, went to the physical realm?
[time=647] And I wonder how many of you in the room went to the spiritual realm.
[time=654] See, this morning I'd like to talk to you about, I'd like the word of God to teach you about salvation.
[time=662] About being saved, and how sweet, and how good, and how great, and how awesome.
[time=672] This salvation is that God has given.
[time=678] The story began one summer's day toward the end of the 19th century, when an English city boy was on a visit to rural Scotland.
[time=690] That afternoon, the boy went swimming in a small countryside lake after swimming quite a distance from shore.
[time=698] A severe cramp seized him so that he could not continue swimming.
[time=703] He was in great pain and soon cried out at the top of his voice for help.
[time=708] A farm boy, working in a nearby field, heard the city boy's screams and ran as fast as he could to the lake.
[time=716] There the farm boy threw off his shirt, dove into the water, swam to the imperiled city boy and brought him safely to shore.
[time=726] Several years later, the two boys met again, now grown quite a bit.
[time=731] The city boy still filled with gratitude that the other boy had saved his life, was thrilled to see the farm boy once again, and asked him what career the farm boy had decided to pursue.
[time=745] The farm boy said he had chosen a career in medicine.
[time=749] Since the city boy's parents were quite wealthy and were greatly indebted to the other boy for saving their son's life,
[time=755] upon hearing of the farm boy's career choice, they immediately promised to pay for all of his medical education.
[time=763] They followed through on their promise and the young man went on to have a brilliant career in medical and scientific investigation.
[time=770] In 1928, that farm boy then both a physician and bacteriologist discovered the famous wonder drug penicillin.
[time=780] In 1945, he shared the Nobel Prize with two other scientists for the discovery and development of that antibiotic.
[time=788] That Scottish farm boy turned scientific researcher who died in 1955 was Alexander Fleming.
[time=798] The rescued city boy also gained great renown.
[time=802] During World War II, he contracted a life-threatening case of pneumonia.
[time=807] He recovered at the hospital only after receiving a dose of penicillin,
[time=814] which meant that indirectly the one-time farm boy Alexander Fleming had saved his life twice.
[time=822] The city boy's name was Winston Churchill.
[time=827] Winston Churchill, the famous wartime British prime minister and world statesman.
[time=832] Interestingly, just like Fleming, Churchill won a Nobel Prize, but in his instance, he won the 1953 award in literary for his incisive writings on the history of the Second World War.
[time=847] It is wonderful to save a life.
[time=853] And even more wonderful to save someone's life twice, especially when the one saved was such an influential person, as was Winston Churchill.
[time=864] But the hard-working, selfless contributions of Alexander Fleming are nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to the greatness of people's eternal souls being saved.
[time=883] That great salvation, this eternal salvation, is the heart of the Apostle Peter's concern here in our passage this morning.
[time=893] He wants believers, then and now, to focus on that full final rescue from sin, that full final rescue from Satan, from death and hell, that rescue that God so graciously chose to give them through faith in his son Jesus Christ.
[time=913] You'll remember from previous weeks here in our study of 1 Peter that the audience Peter writes to our Christians, Christ followers, who in that day are being absolutely torn apart, literally in some cases, tortured, beaten, persecuted for their faith by an angry Roman culture.
[time=932] And Peter celebrates salvation's greatness by reminding his readers that no matter how difficult the circumstances or how severe the persecution, they can confidently hold to the hope of an eternal and great salvation.
[time=952] Is there a better word in all the world? Is there anywhere, a more powerful, a more personal, a more precious concept?
[time=967] Is there any singular truth or reality, more moving or more amazing or soul stirring than the picture of salvation, someone being lost and then found someone being in danger and then rescued, someone being completely healed, someone being brought home, someone being restored?
[time=989] I don't know if it gets any better or any bigger than that. Maybe you can remember being lost at the mall as a kid.
[time=999] Anybody? Maybe you can remember being lost at the mall or getting separated from your parents in a crowded setting and how good it felt.
[time=1009] Maybe you were old enough to remember how sweet it was to feel the arms of your mom or your dad or at that point even a sibling would have done.
[time=1019] And they were hugging you and they were kissing you and you're just going, "Oh man, it's good to be back. Good to be restored. Good to be brought home.
[time=1029] Maybe you or a loved one experienced healing from a dangerous or even deadly disease. We cheer you and I.
[time=1037] We cheer as we read stories about little babies being saved from the deadly force of the tsunami wave.
[time=1045] We cheer as they're reunited with family members when all hope was gone.
[time=1052] And we watch television shows. This would now serve as a personal confessional right now. We watch television shows on Sunday nights where run down beat up homes.
[time=1069] So you're all with me, aren't you? We're run down beat up homes and desolate, trashed, dilapidated yards experience a makeover.
[time=1087] And extreme makeover. And we watch all that unfold and I cry. I don't know about you. I feel kind of dumb saying it, but when that stupid bus pulls away, I start to cry.
[time=1105] Every week, it doesn't matter where they are or what the people are like, I cry. Never mind. I have to raise your hand. I'll take this one.
[time=1117] Why? Why do I cry? Why do you cry? I'll tell you why we cry. First of all, there's a story that's been told.
[time=1132] And we get engaged in a story. And when that story leads to something that is so unspeakably, now hear how I say this, because you understand, I know there's something beyond fixed paint and new wood.
[time=1145] I'm making an illustration here, but there is something transcendent about something being saved. Saved something being made new, something that was broken being fixed, something that was really ugly being made beautiful.
[time=1165] You with me? So I cry. Salvation. Being saved and rescued. Being cleaned up. Being made new. Being rebuilt. It's an amazing concept.
[time=1184] And while we're on the whole makeover deal, let me just say this to you. How about the families? How about the family's response? A lot of you have watched it.
[time=1195] How about the family's response when the bus pulls away? How about the look in their eyes? How about the things that come out of their mouths?
[time=1202] How about the reaction that you see as they witness what has been made new? And while we're at it, how about the community?
[time=1210] Every show it kind of kind of gets worked in different, but how about the 500 or 1,000 or 2,000 people who line up across the street having given themselves to the process?
[time=1224] And as they line up just to get a glimpse of what's been redeemed, just to get a glimpse of what's been saved, that scene when the bus drives away and there's all the awe and all the tears and the thrill and the support and the gratitude
[time=1239] and the excitement and the affection and the yells and the screams. And I think about that and I envision a day when baptism would be like that.
[time=1255] Why isn't it? Why do you and I sit in front of a television set and ball our eyes out over new wood and new paint?
[time=1267] And yet when someone comes and tells their story and share with you the miracle of salvation.
[time=1276] Whoo! And that's genuine. I'm not spanking you on the wrist. I'm just like, couldn't I do the same thing?
[time=1284] Why doesn't it evoke something deeper in you and me when someone's saved, made over extremely?
[time=1298] Interesting to think about.
[time=1301] Along for a day when salvation would mean that much to you.
[time=1307] Salvation. What's so great about it? Well, you know what, my friends? It is the central message.
[time=1313] You ever wonder what the real deal is about this book? What is the main theme? What is the overarching principle?
[time=1320] The main central message of the entire Bible is salvation.
[time=1327] That's right, that even though man cannot save himself from the eternal, damning consequences of his or her sin, God, praise God, God can.
[time=1340] And God will. Even though you and I can't, the great central theme of Scripture is that God can and will save.
[time=1349] He will rescue from eternal judgment all individuals who surrender fully, not partially or sort of, but completely.
[time=1359] Their hearts and lives to the Lord Jesus Christ. God is about saving.
[time=1365] We often talk about John 3, 16. We oftentimes kind of do it a disservice by forgetting the verses that come before and the verse that comes after.
[time=1374] You can open up or just look to the screen. Look at John 3, 14 through 17. You're not used to saying that, are you?
[time=1381] John 3, 14 through 17. As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man, that's Jesus Christ, be lifted up, crucified, so that whoever believes in him will have eternal life.
[time=1400] For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish, shall not remain dilapidated, shall not remain broken, shall not remain run down, shall not remain in danger.
[time=1418] No, but whoever believes in him, see God's about saving, shall not perish but have eternal life.
[time=1427] For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be, say it, saved, saved, saved through him, John 4.
[time=1442] John 3, 14 through 17, Psalm 3, 8. Psalm 3, 8 says salvation. You see it there. Salvation belongs to the Lord. Salvation belongs to the Lord.
[time=1454] As we move forward this morning in our verse by verse study of 1 Peter, we pick up today where Pastor Mitch left off last week.
[time=1462] In fact, I want to take you back to where he left us. Go to 1 Peter chapter 1 verses 8 and 9. As Mitch concluded his teaching last week,
[time=1471] we had this idea, this great, glorious concept of salvation introduced.
[time=1476] And I'll take you back to verse 8 in 1 Peter 1 where it says, "And though you have not seen him, you love him.
[time=1483] And though you do not see him now, but believe in him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory.
[time=1497] Obtaining is the outcome of your faith. What the salvation of the rescue of your soul, the salvation of your souls."
[time=1507] Peter culminates this verse 3 through 9 passage with the great truth of salvation.
[time=1513] And now in verses 10 to 12 he desires to share with us how great, how sweet, how significant it really is.
[time=1521] And here's how he does it. Watch this. I hope this will encourage you. I hope this will teach you.
[time=1526] I hope this will further you in your understanding and appreciation of salvation this morning.
[time=1532] He does it in four ways. He does so by referencing the four divinely appointed agents, messengers, couriers, if you will.
[time=1543] He does so by referencing the four divinely appointed agents who carried the message of salvation.
[time=1552] And it is an interesting study. The Old Testament prophets who studied it, the Holy Spirit who inspired it,
[time=1562] the New Testament apostles who preached it, and even the angels who longed to see into it, the angels who examined it.
[time=1575] And that's where we'll go this morning. First Peter chapter 1 verses 10 to 12 in honor of God's Word.
[time=1582] Would you please stand this morning and allow me to read this for you?
[time=1587] It says in verse 10 of chapter 1, "As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you
[time=1597] made careful searches and inquiries, seeking to know these prophets, seeking to know what person or time
[time=1605] the spirit of Christ within them was indicating as he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow."
[time=1615] Verse 12, "It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you in these things
[time=1621] which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven,
[time=1630] things into which angels long to look." Would you pray with me this morning?
[time=1640] Father in heaven, I would sense this morning as I've sensed all week that there is in me, personally,
[time=1647] and that there may even be in the hearts and minds and lives of those gathered in this room this morning,
[time=1653] an insufficient view, a view of salvation that maybe falls short of what it could be.
[time=1663] God, not that we're not grateful to some degree, but God, that maybe somehow in the midst of this life that we live,
[time=1671] maybe somehow in the midst of patterns that have been developed, maybe God in the midst of thinking that's gone maybe a little south.
[time=1677] God in the midst of this life, we've maybe moved away from a proper God-honoring view of how sweet and great and awesome this salvation that you've given really is.
[time=1694] And God, it's important that we would understand it. It's important, God, that we would live with that understanding.
[time=1702] I believe in my heart, God, it would change us.
[time=1705] And so I pray today that you would do that, that through your Holy Word, God, through your Scriptures,
[time=1711] as we do our best to understand this truth today, God, that you would change our perspectives, that our understanding of salvation,
[time=1719] and the way we live it out, God, might be furthered.
[time=1724] We would hope for that this morning, God. We would admit that there's room for that.
[time=1728] And we would pray, God, that your Spirit and your Word would do its changing, transforming work in our lives, in your Son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1738] You can be seated.
[time=1740] So what's so significant, what's so great about salvation?
[time=1745] Well, number one, if you're taking notes this morning, let's write this down.
[time=1748] Number one, it was the theme.
[time=1750] It was salvation was the theme of the prophet's study.
[time=1755] You see that in verse 10 in the first part of 11.
[time=1758] You see, as to the salvation, verse 10, as to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,
[time=1767] made careful searches and inquiries, seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating.
[time=1778] We'll stop there.
[time=1779] I was reminded, again, this week in my own study and reading about the prophets, an amazing group of individuals,
[time=1790] about the prophets.
[time=1791] For some of you, this will be, I hope, helpful review.
[time=1794] For others of you, again, may be a new opportunity to gain some insight into how this all ties together.
[time=1801] The prophets, they were an amazing group of men and women.
[time=1805] They were God's Old Testament spokesmen who prophesied, as our text says, look there, verse 10.
[time=1811] They prophesied of the grace that would come.
[time=1815] They then, as our text teaches this morning, they then pursued the meaning of their own prophetic writings
[time=1823] for all they could about God's promised salvation.
[time=1827] Of all the truth, the prophets received through divine revelation.
[time=1831] It was the truth of salvation that was their greatest passion.
[time=1837] From Moses to Malachi, all of the Old Testament prophets were fascinated by this promise of redemption,
[time=1845] this promise of being made new, this promise of salvation.
[time=1850] Now, these prophets, without seeing Jesus face to face or having a relationship with them like you and I might have today,
[time=1859] these prophets wrote of Messiah and His coming, and they exercised faith.
[time=1864] Don't forget that.
[time=1865] They exercised faith with respect to His coming.
[time=1869] And these prophets never fully comprehended all that was involved in Christ's life, death, and resurrection,
[time=1876] but they wrote of His coming and they believed in His coming.
[time=1881] The focus of the prophets' intense study in trying to comprehend that the saving work of Christ was centered on,
[time=1889] there you see it right there again, on the grace, verse 10, on the grace that would come to sinners like you and I through Christ.
[time=1900] Now, I want to emphasize something here. It's very important that the phrase "propheside of the grace that would come,"
[time=1909] make sure you don't in any way allow that to indicate in your thinking that the prophets looked forward to a saving grace that did not exist then,
[time=1919] because it did.
[time=1921] In the Old Testament times, grace abounded by nature. God has always been an unchangeably gracious God.
[time=1931] In the Old Testament, He was gracious to those who believed.
[time=1935] He was gracious to those who had faith. He was gracious to those who looked for the Messiah's coming.
[time=1941] And since the Messiah's coming, then He is gracious to all who believe by faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ.
[time=1950] Noah received grace from the Lord. Moses was fully aware of God's grace.
[time=1955] The prophet Jonah, even as he struggled to accept the Ninevites' repentance, acknowledged God's grace.
[time=1962] He says in Jonah 4-2, it says, "He prayed Jonah did to the Lord and said, 'Please, Lord, was not this what I said while I was still in my own country.'
[time=1972] Therefore, in order to forestall this, I fled to Tarshish.'"
[time=1978] See, Jonah called by God to go and preach to the people of Nineveh.
[time=1984] And he didn't want to go to Nineveh. He wasn't a very gracious guy.
[time=1987] And he knew if he went to preach a Nineveh God, and his graciousness would save them.
[time=1992] And so he tries to run away from God's calling.
[time=1995] He says, "For I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and one who relents concerning calamity.
[time=2009] Salvation, my friends, has always been available. Grace has always been available to sinners.
[time=2017] And always, and only by grace through faith." So, there was never any question during the Old Testament whether or not God was gracious.
[time=2028] But the great manifestation of His grace, Jesus Christ, the Messiah would come with the arrival of His Son.
[time=2037] Though the Old Testament listened to this, though the Old Testament prophets knew that their writings described a future manifestation of saving grace,
[time=2046] their desire to understand, to grasp those prophecies was still so compelling and so pervasive that they look at our text,
[time=2058] that they made careful searches and inquiries.
[time=2063] You see it right there, 1 Peter 1, 10?
[time=2065] Careful searches and inquiries into their own writings, those two terms there.
[time=2071] Careful searches and inquiries emphasized the intensity with which the prophets had delved into their prophecies
[time=2080] and the diligence with which they had investigated them to better understand the magnitude and scope and wonder of salvation grace.
[time=2093] How has your search gone? How intently and how passionate are you to better see and understand and grasp this amazing salvation, these prophets?
[time=2113] I read all this and I study all this. I kind of feel bad for them in a sense. I mean, I'm thankful for the role they played.
[time=2120] I wish they could have seen more.
[time=2123] Matthew, chapter 13, verse 17, Christ kind of communicates the same thing. He tells His disciples in Matthew 13, 17.
[time=2131] He says, "For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see."
[time=2141] They wrote about it. They foretold it, but they never got to see it.
[time=2146] What you see, and they desired to hear what you hear and did not hear it.
[time=2156] These godly, wonderful, faithful prophets, and salvation was the theme of their study.
[time=2166] Number two, write this down. It was also salvation was. It was the theme of the Spirit's inspiration.
[time=2174] Salvation was the theme of the Spirit's inspiration.
[time=2179] You see it there, the middle part of 11, on down to the middle of verse 12, the Spirit of Christ within them, within the prophets.
[time=2188] The Spirit of Christ was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.
[time=2196] It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you.
[time=2201] See, the prophecies that the Holy Spirit revealed to the prophets were divinely inspired and they were recorded under the Spirit's authority and guidance.
[time=2212] Yes, the prophets wrote them down. Yes, the prophets proclaimed them. These prophecies, though, came from the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God.
[time=2223] In an overall theme of those prophets, you can write down Jeremiah 1-9. You can read more about that principle, that great truth of inspiration.
[time=2231] Jeremiah 1-9, Ezekiel 2-7, Amos 3-7 through 8. You could write those references down and later today or tonight in your further study.
[time=2243] You could look those texts up. And overall, and the overall theme of those prophecies was twofold.
[time=2251] The overall theme of these prophecies that the Spirit guided and had authority over was twofold.
[time=2258] The sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. You see it right there in our text.
[time=2263] The Old Testament refers to the sufferings of Christ in such passages as you can write these down.
[time=2269] Psalm 22, 1-31, Isaiah 52, 13-53, Daniel 9, 24-26, and Zechariah 12, 10, the sufferings of Christ.
[time=2285] These prophecies also spoke to the glories that would follow, including such truths as the resurrection and the ascension and Christ's enthronement.
[time=2295] This appears in passages like Isaiah 9, 6-7, Daniel 2, 44, Daniel 7, 13-14, Zechariah 2, 10-13.
[time=2310] And this is important here that Peter used the phrase, look in your text, that Peter used the phrase "Spirit of Christ within them."
[time=2320] Demonstrates that the eternal Christ Himself, inseparable from the Holy Spirit, right? Christ, the Holy Spirit, Father God, the Godhead there, the 3-1.
[time=2333] This demonstrates that the eternal Christ, inseparable from the Holy Spirit, worked from within the Old Testament writers to record God's infallible revelation that in the end was about Himself.
[time=2350] And this is why Peter wrote in his second letter, right down 2 Peter 1-21, this is exactly why, and it's important for all of you to know this.
[time=2359] It's important for all of you to understand and believe this, because we place so much faith in, we put so much stock in the fact that we believe this book to be absolutely true.
[time=2371] Peter, because of how it was inspired, because of how it was written, because of how it was recorded. He writes in 2 Peter 1-21 that no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
[time=2392] My friends, this is not Amos or Joel or Ezekiel's best crack at it. This is not Jeremiah or Peter's, you know, that they're best stabbed in the dark or they're leaning. No, my friends, no prophecy was ever recorded by an act of human will.
[time=2412] It was inspired, as it says right here in our text, by the Spirit of God. The Spirit was, look in your text, the Spirit was indicating.
[time=2422] You see that? Verse 11, "The Spirit of Christ within them, within the prophets, was indicating..." It's the Greek word "edelu", which means making plain. He was making plain. He was making simple.
[time=2436] As he predicted, as he predicted that Greek word means to witness beforehand that which was coming, he was plainly testifying to the prophets about God's salvation that would be fully accomplished through Jesus Christ.
[time=2455] It was the theme of the prophets study. It was the theme of the Spirit's inspiration. Thirdly write this down. It was the theme of the apostles preaching. What's so great about salvation?
[time=2470] We'll tell you what, it was the theme of the apostles preaching. We now move past the Old Testament to the New Testament. Last part of verse 12, you see it there? They were not serving themselves. But you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel. And who was it that preached the gospel to these people? They were called the what? The apostles.
[time=2496] It was the apostles who came and were sent out from Jerusalem to preach the gospel. The gospel that was preached to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Things into which angels long to look. The Holy Spirit, my friends, not only inspired the Old Testament prophets, but the New Testament apostles as well, who took the now fully revealed gospel.
[time=2521] Now all that had been prophesied has come true in the person of Christ and the saving, atoning work of Christ on the cross. His death, his burial, his resurrection, it has all transpired. And so now the fully revealed gospel of salvation has come. And these apostles, they take this theme.
[time=2543] They took this theme of the gospel and they took it into their ministry. They took it into their lives. They took it into their preaching, preaching that don't forget.
[time=2554] Listen now, how much does salvation mean to you? Don't forget that they so took this in as their theme and they preached it with such boldness and courage that they died, that they were killed.
[time=2572] They were crucified. They were tortured. They were burned. They were exiled because it meant so much to them.
[time=2583] How important was it? How motivating was it? How awesome was it? How significant was it? They gave their lives so they could proclaim it. Salvation, my friends.
[time=2596] The salvation message, the gift of saving faith, the gospel. It was, watch this, it was paramount. It was central to apostolic, New Testament preaching.
[time=2609] But see, let me say that statement again now because I want to just say it a different way because as I say it to you a different way, please understand it's just as true this second way as it was the first way because you see, it should be paramount and central to your.
[time=2625] Teaching. To your communication. To your proclamation. Salvation. It was at the hub. It was at the center of all they did. They were passionate about it.
[time=2643] And you and I should be thankful that they were. It was their passion for the gospel. It was their commitment to teach salvation that over the years has led to you and I being here.
[time=2657] It was paramount and central and it should be paramount and central in your communication and in mind. I love how Paul, I love how Paul says it. I want you to read this passage with me and I want you to think not only about Paul.
[time=2672] I'll tell you what, it's how I feel so many times about me. And I got a ways to go in this journey but I feel this almost every day of my life and I bet it will resonate with many of you in the room this morning. Look at 2 Corinthians 2, verse 1.
[time=2690] Paul says, "And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom proclaiming to you the testimony of God. Stop there. Don't go any further. Question for you. Is there anybody in the room who when you're given and you know it and I know it, God gives us these opportunities to share the truth, to articulate the gospel, to be in a conversation with someone.
[time=2719] Maybe someone we know and love and maybe it's come to this point in our relationship where certain questions are asked and we get the unspeakable privilege of sharing with them.
[time=2731] The good news of salvation, anybody in the room ever worry about not saying it the right way. You feel like you should be a little bit more superior in your speech. Raise your hand. Anybody ever struggle with that? Yeah, look at that.
[time=2747] Anybody in the room ever struggle with maybe it's not so much the speech but you just know that if you get in that setting you're going to blow it because you just don't know enough.
[time=2757] You're just not smart enough. You're just not bright enough. You can't retain all this stuff and it's just going to come out bad. Anybody identify with them?
[time=2766] Yeah, Paul could. Paul could. I can. You kidding me? Every Sunday at 9, every Sunday at 8.55 and 10.40.
[time=2780] I feel those very same feelings week after week and I know you do as well. Watch where he goes.
[time=2788] Verse 2, "For I determined to know nothing." Here's how he gets around all that. "I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[time=2800] The salvation message. Keep going. Verse 3 says, "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit."
[time=2819] See folks, listen. Here's the deal. The same Spirit of God who inspired the prophets to write the way they did and proclaim what they proclaimed about salvation.
[time=2830] The same Spirit of God who was at work in the hearts and lives of the apostles that inspired them to preach with great diligence and passion, the message of salvation.
[time=2841] It's the same Spirit that's taken a guy like Paul who worried about his words and worried about his knowledge and the Spirit of God brought power to what he said in the Spirit of God will bring power to what you say.
[time=2856] When you're willing to, with a heart full of love and grace, open your mouth and share about the hope that is within you because it is a demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
[time=2868] Verse 5, "So that your faith would not rest." You don't want that. I don't want that. Nobody wants to have a faith that would rest on the wisdom of men so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men but on the power of God.
[time=2884] Salvation. My friends, listen, the prophets were absolutely enamored with it.
[time=2899] The Spirit of God made sure that it was proclaimed and recorded in just the right way. The apostles gave their lives so it would be preached, embraced and passed on because they did you and I are here, saved.
[time=2921] So now I wander this morning. As I think about this, I wonder, and I've been thinking all week, you know, so, so what?
[time=2934] So where do you and I go? I mean, I hope that's helpful. I mean, I hope you get a sense for how great it is.
[time=2943] I hope you get a sense for all that went into its offering. I hope you somehow get a sense today that there have been those over the years who were very, very devoted to it, very, very enamored by it, very willing to preach it and proclaim it.
[time=2957] But so what about you now? As you leave this place this morning, how great, how awesome, how stirring is the salvation of yours, if in fact you know him today.
[time=2975] And I've got a question for you. And I'm going to assume something here. I'm going to assume that there might be a few in the room like me who would agree that it's not.
[time=2986] It's not as overwhelming and it's not as magnificent and it's not held as dearly as it should be.
[time=2997] Some of you may not. I feel that way at times.
[time=3003] Why? Why isn't salvation this great gift? Why isn't it just so? Why aren't you and I just face down oozing with gratitude?
[time=3013] You know, when the bus pulls away and the family's there, we can attach a lot of words to that, but one of the things that just immediately comes to my mind is they're so grateful.
[time=3024] They're so thankful for, and it's just wooden paint, I know, but they're so thankful for what has been made new.
[time=3031] And they just can't, they can't say it enough and they run out of words. They're so deeply grateful.
[time=3041] And why aren't we? As grateful as we should be. I wrote a few things down. You can probably add to this list.
[time=3050] And I just kind of, I was just kind of just writing and God was kind of giving me some direction. I even talked to a few folks and we kind of got in on it together.
[time=3058] You know what? I'll just throw out a couple of options. One reason why salvation maybe isn't as overwhelming.
[time=3066] Why we don't view it the way we should is we may not teach enough about hell.
[time=3075] See, I don't know, I don't know if you can remember, I can't remember the last message I gave you about hell.
[time=3082] A very real place, a reality, a destination eternally for some, possibly even in this room.
[time=3093] Another thing I wrote down was this attitude I see again and again today in the Church of entitlement.
[time=3099] And what I mean by entitlement is this, I mean by entitlement, it's almost as if people think they deserved it.
[time=3105] You think you deserve to be, I think sometimes I deserve to be saved.
[time=3109] What it reveals is a very poor view of our sinfulness.
[time=3113] It reveals a very poor view of our depravity and the depths of our sin and how we didn't deserve anything but hell.
[time=3126] That would be very counterculture, that kind of thinking.
[time=3131] A friend and I were talking about it and he mentioned that sometimes it's not as overwhelming.
[time=3136] Sometimes we're not as grateful for it because we don't reflect on it very much because we're so busy doing things.
[time=3145] We seldom stop and go, "Wow, I'm saved."
[time=3162] Another thing I wrote down was just we probably don't walk closely enough.
[time=3165] You and I probably don't walk closely enough with him, our intimacy with him, our personal abiding,
[time=3172] our reading and our meditating and our asking questions about and finding some answers
[time=3178] and our relationship with him probably isn't as close as it should be
[time=3184] because when my relationship gets really close and when I meditate and abide in him and I walk with him
[time=3192] and I'm surrounded by what's true instead of what's false, I tend to get really, really grateful.
[time=3198] But you and I probably don't do that as much as we should.
[time=3203] Well, I'm going to ask Ed and Corbin in the band to come back up.
[time=3207] I want you to sit tight right where you are and I want you to think about two things as we leave this morning.
[time=3217] I feel as if, okay, hear me now, I feel as if in my heart I sense that you and I should be more.
[time=3226] I think we should be more grateful for this great salvation that he has brought to you and I.
[time=3235] I think we should thank him more for that.
[time=3238] I think you should in your prayers and in your morning and in your noon and in your night.
[time=3243] I think with your kids and I think at work and I think in your quiet moments, I think we should thank him more often for this great salvation.
[time=3253] I also feel as if that our gratitude for it should compel us to want to share it.
[time=3265] One thing I wrote down I didn't mention and I say this about me and not just about you.
[time=3270] One reason why I think it's not as overwhelming and not as important as it should be
[time=3276] is I think sometimes we're just plain selfish, my friends.
[time=3281] Sometimes I think you sit in a baptism and don't emote anything because bottom line you know what?
[time=3287] You just don't care that much about them.
[time=3292] And we got to work on that, you and I.
[time=3296] We have to repent and confess our self-centered preoccupation with our world and our agenda and be able to bask at moments in the utter greatness of salvation.
[time=3307] As Ed sings our theme song, this is a song you've heard each week now.
[time=3312] It's a song that kind of captures the essence of our first Peter study and it talks about how because we're saved, because we've tasted some things, because of our salvation we're able to move on.
[time=3324] Listen, listen carefully and thank God for your salvation and we'll close in just one minute.
[time=3337] Why do we do the things we do?
[time=3349] How can we see when there seems no reason to?
[time=3356] How do we smile when there's not much to smile about when the world is down?
[time=3366] Who are we to stand and shout?
[time=3370] They wonder why we do the things we do.
[time=3377] It's all because of this.
[time=3385] We've tasted love, we've tasted hope, we've tasted love and this.
[time=3391] It's all because of this, it's all because of this.
[time=3398] We've tasted love, we've tasted hope, we've tasted holyness.
[time=3405] They wonder why we do the things we do.
[time=3422] [AMEN] Amen, would you stand with me this morning and bow your heads as we close?
[time=3428] I would suggest to you this morning that there is one reason and one reason alone
[time=3435] that allows you and I to sing when there's not much to sing about.
[time=3440] There's one thing and one thing alone that allows us to stand and proclaim what's true and right and good when so many things externally may be going wrong.
[time=3454] The song says we've tasted hope, we've tasted love, we've tasted holiness.
[time=3459] My friends, in essence what it says there is that you can sing when there's not much to sing about because you've tasted salvation.
[time=3469] You have been saved and I hope that that is true for you this morning.
[time=3476] And I pray and we as a family pray that if it's not that you would ask, that you would get with whoever you might need to get with, that you would confide in a trusted friend, that you would be diligent to move down this road of faith to make sure that you have fully surrendered your heart and life to the one that brings so great a salvation.
[time=3502] God, we've come before you this morning thankful for your word and thankful for the truth that it reveals.
[time=3510] God, I pray that as we leave this room today that even in our interactions in the next 10 minutes, even in our interactions tonight, God, whatever you might bring us tomorrow, that we would those of us here that know you, that we would live and speak and respond as people who have the privilege
[time=3528] of being saved and that there would be a gratitude in us constantly
[time=3535] that would allow us to with grateful hearts not only bask in what we've received,
[time=3541] but God, share it with those you bring our way.
[time=3544] Give us strength to do that well in your son's name we pray and they all agreed and said,
[time=3552] "You know, I'm not going to be a good person.
