[time=539] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk
[time=550] Ministries, and it is great to be with you again.
[time=552] I look forward to these times where we get to you and I, those of you in the viewing audience, I feel like we get to connect right here for just a few minutes.
[time=561] I wish I could see your face, but I'll tell you what, just knowing that you're out there, hearing the things I hear from you, getting the letters that I get, getting the emails that I get.
[time=572] Sometimes even your willingness to pick up the phone and call, we love hearing from you.
[time=577] And I'm so grateful that you're being encouraged, so thankful that you're being challenged in your spiritual journey.
[time=584] So thankful that you're receiving new and I hope meaningful teaching, and we're really glad that you've tuned in again.
[time=591] Hey, I wanna say this to you.
[time=592] I say it to you about every once or two, three months or so, I gotta say it to you again today because I continue to meet people who tell me that they're now coming to Black Hawk.
[time=604] We've seen great growth here in recent days, and I keep meeting people young, old, in between single moms, families with kids.
[time=612] I meet them, we talk, and they tell me time and time again that their journey to Black Hawk began with the Bible hour.
[time=621] They would watch midweek on Thursdays or each Sunday morning, and they would turn on their TV and they would worship and they would hear from God's Word, and it touched their hearts.
[time=632] It began to be something they really looked forward to, and they would do that for two or three or four weeks or three or four or five months, and then they just had to come and see what it was like in person, and now that they've come, they just can't leave because there is something so sweet about being together in this place, and I just wanna invite you, those of you who watch and you don't have a church home, I mean a place where you can go, more than that, a people, a family that you can connect with, a family, a band of Christ followers who would be willing to stand with you in life, walk through life with you, pray for you, hold you accountable, fold you into the life and ministry of a church, I mean that's what we're here for, and I just wanna invite you again, if you've been watching, we're so thankful, but come and join us, come and see us, come and say hello to me, I'd love to meet you, nine o'clock and 1045 on Sunday mornings, we would invite you to come and be a part, and after the service, just make your way down, and say hello to us, we'd love to put a name with a face, we'd love to pray with you, if that's what you needed, we'd love to come alongside you however we can, so we're thankful you're watching, come and join us, first chance you get, and today, as you prepare for the message that you're about to hear, I want you to think about something, I want you to think about holiness.
[time=716] Now I know that's a powerful word, and for many of us it's very big and lofty, and sometimes even scary word, but I want you to think about that right now, holiness, I know if I talk about personal holiness, your holiness, or my holiness, oftentimes what immediately comes to mind is the word unattainable, or maybe just it's very, very confusing, and as we teach through a passage today in our ongoing study of 1 Peter, we will come to this issue of holiness, and the fact that God has called you and I to be holy.
[time=755] Now I want you to listen, because He's called us to be holy, and yet oftentimes you and I think about doing holy.
[time=765] And so as you listen today, I pray, and I hope that the Spirit of God will open your mind and heart to some teaching on personal holiness that would encourage you, and then would help you see something like holiness and a whole new light, I pray that it will, and I look forward to seeing what God's gonna do in your heart and life as you join us today in our ongoing study of 1 Peter.
[time=788] Thanks for tuning in.

[time=1062] - Well, I want to welcome you this morning.
[time=1074] We're so thankful.
[time=1075] To be able to have this time with you today.
[time=1078] It's been quite a week for me personally
[time=1084] and I want to just, I want to share this with you before I take it as Psalm 19.
[time=1091] Every week I'll sit down, every week.
[time=1097] And I love Mondays 'cause I get to sit down nice and early on Monday morning and begin to try and craft with God's help what he wants me to bring to you that week.
[time=1109] And he always lets me, and I say it that way, he always lets me kind of take his word and then kind of add to that what I feel like I should add to that, to just kind of bolster that up.
[time=1122] And it's always been a good thing and he's always teaching me as I go.
[time=1126] And so this week as I sat down every time I was supposed to,
[time=1134] I couldn't write anything.
[time=1140] And I tried, it was like Jim Carrey and Liar Liar trying to lie and he couldn't, you know, it was like I actually had my pen and I was like trying to write, I couldn't write.
[time=1148] And it wasn't that I didn't study, I did, I read and I read and I read and I read and I wanted to write, but I couldn't write.
[time=1153] So I have nothing written.
[time=1156] And he just impressed upon me from Monday on just this week.
[time=1162] You know, just, he just kept hearing him say just the word.
[time=1166] Just the word, nothing else.
[time=1172] So all we get today, amen, is just the word.
[time=1179] None of me.
[time=1182] And I hope, you know, I'm here and I'm gonna do my best to say what he wants me to say.
[time=1188] But as I was thinking about it, I just wanted you to just close your eyes and bow your heads if you would, because Psalm 19 comes to mind, 'cause if all we're gonna get to the word, I wonder if this might make sense to you.
[time=1199] It says in Psalm 19, that the word of God is perfect, restoring the soul.
[time=1206] And maybe he knew this week someone's soul needed restoring.
[time=1213] Says the word of God is sure.
[time=1218] Making wise, the simple.
[time=1221] And maybe he just knew that there was somebody here today who needed some wisdom.
[time=1228] Says the word of God is right, rejoicing the heart.
[time=1234] And possibly he knew that there would be one or two here this morning whose hearts would need to rejoice.
[time=1242] It also says in Psalm 19 that the word of God is pure, enlightening the eyes.
[time=1249] And oh God, we come before you this morning.
[time=1253] So many of us willing and ready in our hearts to have our eyes enlightened.
[time=1260] God, that we could see what you would want us to see.
[time=1263] God, that we could ascertain that, which you've brought us to consider.
[time=1267] God, that we could be a people today who because of the power of your word and your word alone would understand better this calling God that you've placed on our lives.
[time=1278] And so God, we open ourselves today to your word, let it rain, let it fall down.
[time=1286] These holy words, ancient words, ever true that continue to change and they continue to remind and they continue to teach.
[time=1295] And we give ourselves to it completely this morning in your son's name we pray.
[time=1303] [AMEN] (gentle music) - Amen.
[time=1309] Well, last week we learned about this great salvation
[time=1318] that we've been given.
[time=1320] It's a pretty amazing thing, this salvation of ours.
[time=1324] And this morning I've just entitled our study, thank you for saving me.
[time=1329] Now what?
[time=1330] What do you want me to do?
[time=1332] How do you want me to live?
[time=1333] Who is it God that you want me to be?
[time=1336] And I'll just start by just telling you this as I read through the text again and again and again this week.
[time=1344] I was reminded of something that my wife and I are trying and trying would be the operative word there.
[time=1349] We're trying to do this with our kids and we've tried to do this with our kids from the very beginning.
[time=1356] And sometimes we've by God's grace been somewhat successful and sometimes we've just failed miserably but what we've tried to do from when Russell T.
[time=1366] was just about two years old is we've tried to develop a sense of identity.
[time=1370] We've tried to help our kids understand that there are some things really, really special about being a part of a family.
[time=1380] And the way we've done it is this, it's just the way we've done it, it's not the way you have to do it, it's just that from the very beginning we've kind of helped our kids know that there's certain things that they're to do because they're birds.
[time=1393] This is what, you know, this is what birds do.
[time=1396] Birds from the very beginning.
[time=1398] Birds say, thank you.
[time=1401] They say, thank you, every chance they get.
[time=1405] They say, thank you when a gift is given.
[time=1407] They say, thank you when a kind act is done.
[time=1409] They say, thank you when a waitress brings water.
[time=1412] You just, we just, we try to teach them.
[time=1414] You just do that because that's what birds do and you're a bird.
[time=1417] And they get real confused by that when they were young but in time they began to understand that that's our family where birds, birds say, thank you.
[time=1427] We tried our very best to help them and we still work on this to this day.
[time=1432] We try and help our little ones understand that when an adult speaks to you, you look that adult in the eyes and you don't stop looking that adult in the eyes until they're done talking to you.
[time=1444] 'Cause that's kind and that's respectful.
[time=1448] That's gracious behavior and that's what birds do.
[time=1450] You see birds look adults in the eyes.
[time=1452] We teach them, you're a bird, that's what you do.
[time=1455] I'm working with my other boys.
[time=1457] I'm trying my best.
[time=1458] Dad's working at this and I'm trying to help them be polite to ladies.
[time=1463] See bird boy, I'm trying to teach them.
[time=1465] Bird boy, when a door needs to be held, you hold it.
[time=1468] When something drops and you go pick it up, you do everything you can to just be courteous and kind to a lady because that's what birds do and the bird family, we do that.
[time=1481] And I want you to catch this.
[time=1485] Not because that's what good Christian kids do.
[time=1490] No, not because that's what you do.
[time=1494] No, it's because of who you, what are, you're a bird.
[time=1499] And I want you to understand this morning
[time=1505] as we go through this text that every person in this room who knows the Lord Jesus Christ, every person in this room who has a fully devoted, fully surrendered relationship with him, you have been saved, God rescued you from your sin and the damnation that came with it.
[time=1526] You're a part of a family and you're not a bird.
[time=1532] You're a Christ follower and there are some things.
[time=1537] There are some things that you and I need to do, but as the text unfolds, you'll see that we do them because of who we are.
[time=1546] And I hope you'll listen and I hope you'll take it in.
[time=1551] First Peter, chapter one, verses 13 through 16.
[time=1556] In honor of God's word, would you stand with me this morning and allow me to read this to you.
[time=1562] Says in first Peter 1, 13, "Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ, as obedient children do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, but like the holy one who called you be holy yourselves
[time=1590] also in all your behavior because it is written, you shall be holy for I am holy." Pray with me, would you?
[time=1602] Father, God, we sense that you would want to and desire to
[time=1611] and have already this morning done something so very special in our midst.
[time=1617] And so with great humility and with hearts and minds and lives wide open, we continued to come before you this morning and would just pray, God earnestly, diligently from the depths of our being, God, please, as your word speaks, change us.
[time=1636] God, as your word communicates truth, transform us.
[time=1639] God, as your word is opened today and as we consider it's great truth, God, I pray that we would be a people willing to grow and willing to be open to whatever you might have for us today.
[time=1653] Give us humble hearts and ears to hear and your son's precious name we pray, amen.
[time=1659] You can be seated.
[time=1662] You know, let me direct your attention to the very first word in verse 13.
[time=1669] We've talked about this before in different settings.
[time=1671] I wanna remind you again that wherever you see the word therefore, all right?
[time=1677] Wherever you would see the word therefore, as you're reading your Bible and you would come to a new paragraph or a different section, if you see that section beginning with the word therefore, it's very important that you just stop, take a minute and think or say to yourself this, what did we just see?
[time=1694] What was it that we just learned?
[time=1697] What was it?
[time=1698] What truth or truths were just communicated?
[time=1701] Because that's what the therefore is.
[time=1704] It's there so that you and I can pause, look back and consider what we've seen.
[time=1708] Well, we're in luck, this happens at verse 13.
[time=1711] All you've gotta think back on is 12 verses.
[time=1713] And let me just summarize those 12 verses for you.
[time=1716] It's very important as our study continues this morning.
[time=1719] Therefore, well, okay, stop.
[time=1722] What we've seen so far is number one, we've seen that these folks that Peter writes to are the persecuted church.
[time=1730] This is the church in Rome.
[time=1732] This is the church scattered around Rome.
[time=1734] As it said, they're in Asia and in Bithynia and Capidotian, Galatian, Pontius.
[time=1739] These folks were having a tough, tough time.
[time=1741] You see, the Roman culture had turned against them.
[time=1744] They're being tortured, they're being persecuted, they're being killed.
[time=1748] They're facing all kinds of hostility.
[time=1751] These are hard days to be a believer in this time.
[time=1756] The second thing that we've seen is that in the midst of all that they're facing, Peter is reminding them that they have been saved.
[time=1765] They were rescued.
[time=1767] God and His graciousness came and gave them a new life.
[time=1771] In relationship with their risen savior, He has brought them to the newness of life and given them a living hope, an imperishable salvation, an undefiled salvation, a salvation that won't fade away as we saw in those first few verses.
[time=1790] Therefore, He says, in light of that, now you, now you, and now you and I have been called to live this life.
[time=1799] Now we must go forward.
[time=1800] Now we've got to face today.
[time=1803] They had to live in the midst of their hostility and you and I now have to live and move forward as Christ followers in the midst of today's hostilities.
[time=1813] How are we supposed to do that?
[time=1817] Thank you for saving me, now what?
[time=1820] Therefore, the text says, prepare your minds for action.
[time=1827] Keep sober in spirit.
[time=1830] Fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=1839] Three very important things right here in this first verse that answer that question, that give you and I guidance as it relates to how it is we're supposed to move forward in the midst of all that we face with the salvation that's so precious that's been given.
[time=1853] He says, okay, you want to follow Christ in today's world, here you go.
[time=1856] Prepare your mind for action.
[time=1860] Interesting there in the original in the Greek prepare your mind.
[time=1864] Has some interesting pictures.
[time=1866] Look at the screen here as they bring it up.
[time=1868] Prepare in some of your translations will read, gird up the loins of your mind.
[time=1874] Raise your hand if your translation says that.
[time=1876] Gird up the loins of your mind.
[time=1878] Some might say that.
[time=1879] Others might just say as mine reads here in the new NAS, prepare your minds for action.
[time=1885] Keep going here, watch this.
[time=1887] Gird to gird up is what it means.
[time=1890] To gird up your mind and gird means was to gather up all the loose ends of one's robe.
[time=1898] One's robes, you might remember from times in the past what we've talked about this day would wear robes in this day, there would be, there was an inner garment, there was an outer garment and sometimes even an outer garment to the outer garment.
[time=1909] They wore a lot those days and they had these robes and wherever they went they had their robes and this word here talks about gathering up all the loose ends of one's robes, important to gather up all the loose ends when it might be time, depending upon what you might encounter, it might be time for you to move quickly.
[time=1930] You might encounter something.
[time=1935] You might bump into something.
[time=1936] You might see someone, there may be a situation that you would walk into and you would wanna get out of that situation or away from that situation quickly and if you had your robe hanging everywhere, if part of your robe was over here, part of your robe was hanging down, part of your robe was behind you and it was time to move quickly, you'd get all tangled up, you trippin', you'd, what?
[time=1960] Fall.
[time=1962] God's word says to you and to me this morning, gird up, not your robe, but your what?
[time=1969] Prepare people, God's word says prepare, first of all, right out of the gate, very first thing he addresses, prepare your mind, gird up your mind, no loose ends, no surprises, nothing hanging over here, nothing hanging over there.
[time=1987] No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take with God's grace and with this help I'm gonna take my mind and I'm gonna bring it all right here and I'm gonna keep it nice and tight and nice and focused and nice and straight because you never know.
[time=1999] I have to, you need to, I need to, I'm learning as I go, I need to prepare my mind to go to the mall.
[time=2010] I didn't think you'd laugh that loud.
[time=2016] For all kinds of reasons, I have to prepare, I think I have to sit on the plane in extra few minutes to prepare my mind to walk through the terminal.
[time=2026] You with me?
[time=2029] I have to prepare my mind to go out in public.
[time=2033] People say things to me sometimes that you just, it would just blow you away.
[time=2040] I have to constantly, you and I need to constantly be preparing our minds because if you and I get caught in the situation and the mind hasn't been prepared, gird it up, boom.
[time=2056] See he's throwing the missiles at you, left and right.
[time=2058] He's throwing the arrows at me.
[time=2060] The enemy is left and right all day long, hour after hour, day after day, week after week.
[time=2065] He's relentless 'cause he wants you and me to fall.
[time=2069] And so we've gotta be preparing our minds.
[time=2074] Romans 12 says we do that by renewing them in this, again and again and again.
[time=2081] Think about Joseph.
[time=2087] My mind goes to Joseph and Potiphar's wife.
[time=2089] Do you remember the story there?
[time=2091] She thought he was pretty good looking I guess.
[time=2093] She thought you know what I need to have him.
[time=2098] I need to have that young man and he was full of character and integrity and Potiphar was away from the house and Potiphar's wife it says comes and seduces Joseph to lay with her and I was thinking about the girding up the robe.
[time=2112] He just left his robe.
[time=2114] Remember in her hands, he ran so fast.
[time=2119] Do you think he was prepared mentally?
[time=2123] God's word says to you and I this morning, you wanna walk this road?
[time=2127] You wanna follow me in the midst of this world with that great salvation I've given you number one, prepare your mind.
[time=2134] Gird up your mind.
[time=2138] Secondly, you can write this down, it just says it right there in the text, keep sober in spirit.
[time=2145] If we're gonna do this, we've gotta keep sober in spirit.
[time=2150] I'll draw your attention to the screen again, let's just look at what the word and the text there that God used, let's just look and see what it means.
[time=2157] To keep sober, it means to choose clear thinking, to be mentally and I would add, I would add physically and emotionally, even self-controlled, to choose clear thinking, to be mentally, self-controlled, and not intoxicated by the allurement of evil, keeping sober.
[time=2181] I won't have you raise your hands, but I would guess there are probably maybe a few of us in the room who can remember what it was like to be drunk.
[time=2197] I can think back to days before I knew Christ, and some of you can maybe identify with the shame
[time=2210] and the futility and the emptiness
[time=2217] and our text even says later the ignorance of drunkenness.
[time=2224] You know, you do things.
[time=2226] Maybe you know folks, if you haven't been there yourself, maybe you know some people, maybe you've got a family member.
[time=2234] But see, you do things that you just, it's a thing about being drunk, you do things you wouldn't normally, what?
[time=2239] Do, you say stuff, you wouldn't normally, what?
[time=2243] You go places, you wouldn't normally, what?
[time=2246] Yeah, it's kind of like a chat room these days.
[time=2253] All chat rooms bad?
[time=2255] No, but it's the same concept.
[time=2259] You see what goes on in there and you realize that you're sitting there, people, kids, adults, sitting there at a keypad typing and saying things they'd never say in person, doing stuff, they'd never, I mean, it's just an amazing reality there.
[time=2272] And you're not in control.
[time=2276] And he says, you know what?
[time=2277] He says, that'll kill you.
[time=2280] The enemy will absolutely eat your lunch if you don't remain spiritually sober, personally sober, clear headed, clear thinking,
[time=2293] self-controlled by the power of the spirit.
[time=2298] He says, keep sober, keep sober in spirit.
[time=2305] You and I are very aware of the destruction that comes when people choose to move away from sobriety.
[time=2313] And you know what, if alcohol's not your deal, it might be chocolate, it might be the thrill of a unbelievable purchase.
[time=2322] It might be food in general, it could be, you know what, it could be money.
[time=2328] Don't make the alcoholic out to be more than you or I are as we chase after things in this life that we somehow think are going to bring relief.
[time=2340] Things other than him, because they don't.
[time=2343] Be it a bottle or a Hershey bar, whether it's a visa card or a summer place at the lake, if the pursuit is out of control, if the pursuit isn't marked by clear thinking, if there's a drunkenness there, God's word says it's not gonna work.
[time=2367] Peter reminds his readers and he reminds you and I, prepare your minds.
[time=2372] Gird 'em up, keep 'em solid, keep it straight.
[time=2376] Know where you're gonna go, know how you're gonna respond.
[time=2379] And by all means, don't think for a moment that somehow you could be in that spot where you're gonna have to make a decision and be drunk in whatever way and get through it.
[time=2392] 'Cause you're not, if you move away from sobriety, spiritually, personally, clear-headed your toast.
[time=2400] Prepare your mind for action.
[time=2404] Keep sober in spirit.
[time=2405] Third thing you see there in the text, fix your hope.
[time=2410] Write that down.
[time=2410] Fix your hope, your vision, your hope.
[time=2415] Fix your Hebrews talks about fixing your eyes on the author and perfecter of your faith.
[time=2421] Fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2428] Interesting as you look at that word fix, it was a military term and it meant eyes right here.
[time=2435] That's what it means.
[time=2438] It means, whoa, hold on.
[time=2441] Lives are at stake.
[time=2444] The battle's on the line here.
[time=2447] Hey, soldier, couldn't be anything more important for you to catch.
[time=2452] Hey, right here, military, ice-fixed.
[time=2457] Don't miss a thing.
[time=2459] Don't be tempted.
[time=2461] Don't be dissuaded.
[time=2462] Don't be led astray.
[time=2464] No, right here, my hope.
[time=2467] A mind that is prepared, a sobriety of spirit
[time=2473] where I'm clear thinking and a willingness each and every day when we roll out of bed to hit the ground, stand up and look at that which I have, what is my hope?
[time=2483] It's that which I've entrusted myself to.
[time=2486] It's what I'm banking on.
[time=2488] It's what I've placed my trust in.
[time=2490] And he says here, fix your hope.
[time=2495] All that you're trusting in.
[time=2497] All that you're banking on.
[time=2499] The reason you and I would get up each day, everything about us is pointing toward with this fixed, prepared, sober spirit.
[time=2507] I am looking forward to the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2511] That refers to in your text there here in our passage today.
[time=2514] That refers to the second coming of Christ.
[time=2516] I am living, I am breathing, I am moving, I am choosing.
[time=2520] I am fixed because everything I'm about is about that day.
[time=2524] And I'm gonna do what I can.
[time=2525] I'm gonna do what he calls me to.
[time=2527] I'm gonna do it in a way that honors him as I move down this road.
[time=2531] But my hope is fixed right there.
[time=2533] That, here you go.
[time=2535] In the context of this day and in the context of our day, see, they were facing hostility.
[time=2540] You and I are facing hostility.
[time=2541] What's gonna get you through?
[time=2543] When will it all be over?
[time=2545] When you get to Friday night?
[time=2548] Or when you get to see him?
[time=2551] Prepare your mind for action.
[time=2559] Keep sober in spirit.
[time=2561] Fix your hope, the text says.
[time=2566] And verse 14, let's go on.
[time=2570] And as obedient, not as disobedient, as obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance.
[time=2583] Don't be conformed, as obedient children.
[time=2589] Do not be, let me just say it to you again, moms and dads, let me just say this to you again.
[time=2595] I just can't stress enough.
[time=2598] The more we see today and our students, the more we see today and adults like you and me, the more we're reminded of how very important it is that from the very earliest of ages, you and I would be teaching them that there is no greater cause, there is no greater pursuit than obeying.
[time=2618] And the willingness that they have and the readiness they have to obey you will in time become and have a lot to do with the readiness and willingness they have to obey him.
[time=2631] As obedient children, do not be conformed.
[time=2634] You see that word, conformed, interesting word, conformed in the Greek as you look that up and you kind of learn more about that word, conformed is a phrase that meant to strike a pose.
[time=2644] It's about pretense, it's about acting in a way or doing something that's not at all consistent with who you really are, it's to pretend, it's to maintain an outward expression that does not truly reflect the inward condition.
[time=2662] And he kind of takes you and I back to this idea
[time=2668] that my friends were saved, you got made new, you're a different person, you're a new creation,
[time=2680] the spirit of God resides in you.
[time=2683] Why, why?
[time=2684] He says, why would you walk around with a mask on?
[time=2688] Why would you walk around in infidelity?
[time=2691] Why would you walk around in greed?
[time=2693] Why would you walk around in sensuality?
[time=2696] Why would you walk around in divisiveness?
[time=2700] Why would you walk around gossiping?
[time=2703] Why would you walk around with this mask doing these things, conducting yourself in a way?
[time=2709] It's not you.
[time=2713] And see, this is a real struggle because sometimes for many of us, it was so us.
[time=2720] Amen?
[time=2721] I mean, for many of us, it was drilled into us.
[time=2726] I mean, it was us.
[time=2728] And see, that's how great the salvation is 'cause now it's not, but now we need to live submissive to, yield it to, ever mindful of that change and that growth, I see it in you and you would see it in me.
[time=2744] There's times I'll listen to people, there's times I'll watch people and just say to myself, my heart'll break.
[time=2751] I'll go, no, no, don't, don't do that.
[time=2756] That's not, that's not you.
[time=2762] I mean, I know you think it's you, it's not you.
[time=2768] Don't be conformed.
[time=2770] Don't walk around choosing things that don't represent the real new you and you know what, it's a lot easier to not be conformed when your mind is prepared, when you're sober in spirit and you fixed your hope.
[time=2787] Makes sense?
[time=2790] The text is amazing, isn't it?
[time=2792] Don't be conformed.
[time=2797] The former lusts which were yours in your, let's just, let's just hit this one more time.
[time=2801] The lusts which were yours in your what?
[time=2803] Say it louder.
[time=2805] Whatever the enemy's offering, you, I don't know.
[time=2813] I know what he offers me.
[time=2815] Whatever the enemy offers you, whatever it is he is saying to you, move away from a mind that's prepared, move away from sobriety, come over here and have a little bit of this.
[time=2831] 'Cause this'll, this'll do the trick.
[time=2834] Whatever it is he's holding up in front of you, promising you life and fulfillment and satisfaction.
[time=2841] Just know that the text says it today, we don't say this word in our house, but I can say it 'cause the text says it.
[time=2847] It's just stupid.
[time=2851] It's ignorant for you and I to fall into that, for you and I to go there, for you and I to chew, that is just plain ignorance.
[time=2860] And it's not consistent with who he's made you to be.
[time=2866] We're smarter than that by his grace and with his power.
[time=2870] And he gives us because of the spirit of God and it's the ability to choose.
[time=2874] Now watch this.
[time=2880] As obedient children do not be conformed to the former lusts, which were yours and your ignorance, but here you go, here's the kicker.
[time=2886] But like the holy one who called you, be holy.
[time=2891] Yourselves also in all, not some, not most of, not six days, no, in all of your behavior.
[time=2900] He says, be holy yourselves in all your behavior, verse 16, because it is written, you shall be holy, for I am holy.
[time=2909] Now I want you to see two things, as we look at this in our text this morning, I want you to see two things about holiness.
[time=2914] Would you write these down?
[time=2915] Because it's so very important today that you understand that this is about holiness.
[time=2922] Holiness is what we must meet hostility with.
[time=2927] The pressures and the temptations and the difficulties of this life.
[time=2933] That's why we've entitled this whole series.
[time=2936] When holiness meets hostility, holiness is what's called for from you and I.
[time=2942] But I want you to understand today two components of this.
[time=2945] Write this down.
[time=2946] There is the position, there is the position of holiness and there is the practice of holiness.
[time=2956] The position and the practice.
[time=2959] And here's how I'm gonna try and explain that to you.
[time=2963] Raise your hands if you were taught in any way, shape, or form.
[time=2968] And again, I'm not knocking this, I just, I understand it.
[time=2971] It's kind of what I got taught, but I wanna help you think through it a little bit, maybe more clearly.
[time=2976] If you got taught at all, that holiness, being who God want you to be, you got taught that holiness somehow was it kind of equated with not smoking, not drinking, not chewing, not dating girls that did, not going, to keep your hands up, not going to movies that had bad moral content.
[time=3003] Hands up, yeah, if somehow, yeah, okay, good, thank you.
[time=3009] See, we got taught a lot growing up that holiness was equated with what we did or didn't do.
[time=3021] Now I wanna take you back to the text.
[time=3023] Does your text say, or does the text on the screen say, but like the holy one who called you, do holy yourselves also in all your behavior because it is written, you shall do holy because I do holy.
[time=3043] Am I close?
[time=3045] No.
[time=3048] It doesn't say do, it says what, be, be holy.
[time=3053] It's so interesting to begin to realize that what's being set forth here isn't so much a lecture or admonition on a list of things to do or not do, no, this is calling you to a position, this is back to be in the birds, you with me?
[time=3075] This is, now, listen, clearly, clearly, there are some things we're not to do.
[time=3083] Clearly there are some endeavors that we shouldn't be given to.
[time=3089] And on the flip side, clearly there are things that we are to do, we've just gone through a passage that gave you imperative after imperative command after command, fix your hope, keep sober, prepare your mind.
[time=3106] But, watch this, the Christian life is not primarily and initially, let's use the word initially, it is not initially about doing, my friends, it is first and foremost about being.
[time=3119] You aren't a bird, you're a Christ follower, watch this.
[time=3124] And you've heard this from us for years around here.
[time=3127] My friends, it's about a relationship with Christ.
[time=3131] This is about a heart relationship with him.
[time=3134] And when you and I have, truly and genuinely, fully surrendered ourselves to him, fully devoted ourselves to him.
[time=3141] And when you and I are abiding in him, listening to him, reading him, meditating on him,
[time=3150] memorizing what's true, having scripture taught to you, having scripture sung to you, listening to scripture, talking to others about what's true, having accountability, being in community, when we're growing our relationship with him, our identity, who we are, when that grows,
[time=3173] when that gets bolstered, when that gets strengthened, when you're working at being, then it leads to holy, what, doing.
[time=3188] You don't strengthen the relationship, you don't abide in him, you don't meditate on, you don't memorize, you don't sing it, you don't have it sung to you, you don't surround yourself appropriately with that, which is good and right and true.
[time=3202] You don't grow the relationship, you don't grow the being, you won't do holy.
[time=3208] It just doesn't work.
[time=3218] You say, well, you're just splitting hairs, being, doing.
[time=3221] No, I don't think I am, and I think there's something very significant there for you and I, there are things that we need to not do, the not doing it needs to be born out of a heart that is growing in relationship with him.
[time=3237] Amen, does that make sense?
[time=3238] Nod your head, do something, say amen.
[time=3240] Now, you know what, there might be some in the room this morning who needs some help.
[time=3246] You might be sitting here going, you know what, the holiness thing in me, it's not going so well.
[time=3250] I'm not living a holy, holy, what's that mean, set apart?
[time=3256] God honoring separate, I'm not doing so well.
[time=3260] Well, I don't wanna come alongside you and say, well, shame on you, you gotta do this better.
[time=3265] You gotta do that better.
[time=3266] I don't wanna come alongside and give you a tape or a book or a lecture on what you're not doing right.
[time=3272] I wanna come alongside you, we want to come alongside you and help you be, help you grow and your love for him and your relationship with him and your time spent with him and that which is being deposited into you and if you need help there, just ask.
[time=3289] You want a small group to be a part of?
[time=3291] Let us know.
[time=3292] You should jump into the men's Bible study, guys.
[time=3295] You should do it.
[time=3297] Ladies, you should go to the women's ministry table and ask them for everything they got going and find a way to plug in so that your heart and relationship with him can be grown.
[time=3307] Students, moms and dads, young, middle-aged
[time=3313] and you wise ones out there with the lighter hair, keep growing because the more and more you and I keep growing, the more we're able to be the people that he's called us to be, a holy nation, a royal priesthood, a chosen race.
[time=3335] And I'm going to leave you with this.
[time=3336] Man, I was so thankful that this was here.
[time=3339] I was so glad when I read verse 16 and I got to admit to you, I've read verse 16 a thousand times and you may have gotten this, I'm a little slow sometimes.
[time=3354] You may have gotten this a lot sooner than I did, but let me just read it to you.
[time=3359] And hopefully in the context of our discussion today, it might make sense to you in a way that it didn't used to make sense to me, it just kind of burst open right in front of me.
[time=3369] Here you go.
[time=3371] Because verse 16, because it is written, you shall be holy, you shall be.
[time=3380] Not you might be, but you will be.
[time=3386] You shall be holy.
[time=3391] How, how, for he says, for I am holy.
[time=3396] And when you're with me, he says, if you're mine,
[time=3406] if you're abiding in me, if you're growing in me, if you're walking down this road with me, well, guess what?
[time=3414] My friend, he says, I'm holy.
[time=3416] And if you're with me, you will be too.
[time=3421] Amen, amen.
[time=3424] The Word of God, right there.
[time=3427] Powerful, absolutely powerful.
[time=3430] (audience applauds) Why don't you stand and let's close our time this morning.
[time=3439] Let me just say this to you
[time=3446] with your heads bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=3448] If you're new today, we're so thankful that you're here.
[time=3450] If you're visiting today, we're so grateful for any chance we ever get.
[time=3455] To meet someone new, to help them better, connect with God, to help them better connect with us.
[time=3461] If there's anything we can do, we would love to do that for you.
[time=3464] Just make sure you go by the guest center on your way out, introduce yourself to him, fill out a card.
[time=3470] We're thankful for the chance that God gave us today to spend this time with you.
[time=3476] Father God, we come before you this morning and this time right here, so grateful for this book of truth.
[time=3484] This absolutely perfect Word of God.
[time=3487] It's without mistake.
[time=3490] It's without contradiction and it gives life and hope and direction and we are so privileged to be able to hold it, open it, read it and with your help, God, live it.
[time=3502] And so we beg you today to help us live it, to be people who prepare, who stay sober, who fix our hope.
[time=3510] Put the masks down, Father.
[time=3514] We walk away from pretense and we choose to live our lives at work and at home in the light of who we really are.
[time=3523] And if that's hard, if that's challenging, God, I pray that you would move in our hearts to ask for help and allow us God to be the church to come alongside and offer that help and encouragement.
[time=3534] However, we can thank you, God, for the reminder today of your majesty and your greatness.
[time=3542] And again, it is with humility that we offer up our gratitude and pray, God, that you would bring us together again soon, if that be your will.
[time=3551] And all the people agreed and wholeheartedly said, amen.
[time=3564] (silence)
