[time=431] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I wanna welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=436] We're so thankful that you've tuned into the broadcast.
[time=438] You know, people have been tuning in to this broadcast for almost 30 years now.
[time=444] I was talking just recently with Ed Richard.
[time=447] Ed is the producer and director of our Bible Hour broadcast, and Ed's been a part of this team for almost 20 years.
[time=455] And as we talked about that, you know what hit me, that for 30 years, there's one thing that has been consistent.
[time=462] You and I know that in 30 years, many things have changed.
[time=466] But there's one thing that always stays the same.
[time=469] There's one thing that's been a constant through all 30 years of the Bible Hour, and that one thing is this place and its commitment to the Word of God.
[time=479] To teach it, to do our best with His help, to explain it, to without hesitation and without apology, proclaim to you what it says.
[time=490] And I am so thankful that that continues to be the driving force behind this ministry.
[time=496] We love God's Word.
[time=498] We love God, and we're so thankful that He loved us.
[time=501] We're so grateful that He has given us His Word, His life-changing Word.
[time=507] And as we continue to teach it, as we do our best to explain it, as we try to communicate it in ways that are relevant and true, our hope is that it will continue to encourage you, those of you who tune in each and every week and watch.
[time=522] We'll continue today in our study of 1 Peter.
[time=526] What a thrill it's been to just open up God's Word week after week and just take it verse by verse by verse.
[time=533] And as we've been doing that, God has been doing amazing things.
[time=536] In my own heart and life, He has been doing incredible things in the lives of those who are here each week and listening and we're even beginning to hear from you and our audience that this 1 Peter study really is a study that He is using to further you in your spiritual journey.
[time=552] So we're thankful for the Bible hour, thankful for God's Word, and our hope is that you'll continue to benefit.
[time=558] Again, the invitation's open to you.
[time=560] I know you enjoy watching it, but come, come some Sunday and be with us live and in person.
[time=565] We would love to meet you.
[time=567] We'd love to put a name with a face.
[time=569] We'd love to put our arms around you.
[time=570] We would love to do all that we can to encourage you in whatever stage of life you're in.
[time=577] Come and join us on a Sunday morning at nine o'clock or 1045.
[time=581] And don't forget this.
[time=583] When you see this, we'll just be about two weeks away from Easter and we are so privileged this year.
[time=589] Not only are we gonna have an amazing Easter celebration, I mean, there's nothing like Resurrection Sunday and we are going to give ourselves completely to a celebration like nothing you've ever seen before.
[time=603] We hope you'll come and join us on Easter Sunday at nine and 1045.
[time=607] But on Good Friday, we're really excited about this and we're thankful that Pathway Community Church to church out in Northwest Fort Wayne, Pathway Community Church and St. Joe Community Church.
[time=622] Both of these churches are churches that God is using in great ways, churches that have just been planted.
[time=628] They've just started in recent years and God is doing amazing things in those places.
[time=632] And we've got this great friendship with these churches.
[time=635] And so Pathway and St. Joe Community are gonna join Blackhawk on Good Friday Night and you're all invited.
[time=643] We'd love you to come.
[time=645] We're gonna be right here on Good Friday evening at 6 p.m. right here in our worship center.
[time=649] And we want you to come and experience what will be, I think, a powerful, powerful night of remembering the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=660] It will be a night of remembering, it will be a night of worship.
[time=664] It will be an amazing experience as we head into the resurrection weekend.
[time=668] Come and be with us that night.
[time=670] Good Friday right here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=672] We'd love for you to come.
[time=674] And again, have a great rest of your week.

[time=773] (wind blowing) - Well, they were wondering why these first century believers
[time=782] that Peter writes to in our ongoing study of the book of first Peter, they were in that day wondering why in the world they were doing what they were doing.
[time=793] You see, first century believers, and here in this context, those that were in and around Rome, these believers, as we've mentioned in recent weeks, these believers were being slaughtered.
[time=806] These believers were being persecuted.
[time=808] These believers were being attacked.
[time=811] Nero, the emperor and ruler of Rome, as we've mentioned, burned the city to the ground.
[time=818] Over half the city was burned to the ground, and he blamed the Christians.
[time=822] He knew that if he could turn the people against these followers of Christ, he could possibly somehow slow down their momentum, break their spirit.
[time=831] And so they began to be tortured and taken away from their families and sent to work camps, and they were, they made slaves of them, and yet they rejoiced, and yet they had great faith,
[time=846] and yet they endured.
[time=848] Church history and early scholars as they write will tell you about the look in their eyes that would not be dissuaded.
[time=857] They would even continue.
[time=859] I love the video piece you just saw for a number of reasons.
[time=863] One of the reasons I love it is that as it's connected to our study of first Peter and the theme there, when holiness meets hostility, they would in that day, they were continuing to be baptized.
[time=876] They were going public with their love and devotion, knowing what it would bring, knowing what would come their way, and they wondered why they did the things they did.
[time=890] And I love how the song goes because they had tasted love, because they had tasted hope, because they had tasted holiness.
[time=898] We are able to be the people God has called us to be.
[time=902] We are able to sing when there's not much to sing about, we're able to stand with character and courage because of a relationship, a life-saving, eternity-altering relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=916] Now, two weeks ago, just to back up a bit and remind you where we've been two weeks ago, was kind of the first time, two, three weeks ago, was when we began to first see as this study unfolded, this amazing gift that God had brought.
[time=934] God and His love for these believers and His attempt through Peter to encourage them, He reminds them of this amazing gift that He has given them, this incredible reality that was now theirs in relationship with Him.
[time=949] It was about two weeks ago we began to learn about and read more about this salvation that He had given.
[time=957] You can join me back in chapter one, verses eight and nine.
[time=962] Pastor Mitch took us through this.
[time=964] It says in verse eight, "And though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him as we're just saying, you greatly rejoice." Peter was saying this, Peter was writing this to those.
[time=979] He was saying back to them, He was articulating to them their very response to all that was occurring.
[time=990] You love Him and though you do not see Him, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation.
[time=1001] There it is, the salvation of your souls.
[time=1005] God gave these struggling persecuted Christ followers,
[time=1011] a reminder of this gracious, amazing, life-giving, eternity-altering gift of salvation.
[time=1020] I'm reminded as I think about it.
[time=1023] I'm reminded as I read about it, of what Paul said to the church at Ephesus and his letter there in chapter two, verses eight and nine.
[time=1030] Many of you in the room this morning are familiar with Ephesians two, eight and nine.
[time=1035] Some of you have memorized it recently, others of you have helped your kids with it for years.
[time=1039] Some in the room this morning, maybe I've never read it.
[time=1041] And let me just remind you of the great, great salvation truth of Ephesians two, eight and nine.
[time=1046] For by grace you have been what?
[time=1048] Say it, for by grace you have been saved, rescued, spiritually made right through faith.
[time=1058] And that the faith is not of yourselves.
[time=1061] It, the faith is a gift of God, not as a result of works so that no man may boast.
[time=1069] What an amazing truth, what an amazing truth, this principle of salvation.
[time=1076] We saw in our study that, that in our humanness, our sin separates us completely from a holy God.
[time=1085] Man is human, man is in his humanness sinful.
[time=1091] I've not, I've not met too many people
[time=1097] who were gonna argue that point with me.
[time=1100] We've seen in our study that man is separated from God by his sin and that there isn't one thing, listen, that there isn't one thing we can do, we can do about it.
[time=1114] Our separation from God, the distance between sinful man
[time=1120] and a holy God, there isn't anything you and I can do.
[time=1124] God's word teaches us to bridge the gap, nothing.
[time=1128] And yet we try at times, there are some folks I've met and talked with, they're gonna try and buy.
[time=1135] They're gonna try and buy their way back.
[time=1137] They're gonna try and purchase a place in heaven.
[time=1142] God's word says it's not gonna work.
[time=1145] I've met some people who have been taught from the earliest of ages.
[time=1149] I've met folks who believe with all their heart that they're gonna bridge that gap, they're somehow gonna get to God and they're gonna certainly spend eternity with God because they attended a church.
[time=1160] They're gonna church attend their way back to him.
[time=1165] As if walking into brick and mortar every week or most every week would somehow bring you home.
[time=1174] Some think they can actually goodwill themselves to him.
[time=1179] They think like I thought as a young boy that if I just did good things.
[time=1185] I mean, if my good things outweighed the bad things, I would certainly find favor in his eyes.
[time=1193] God's word says that's not the ticket.
[time=1195] We can't save ourselves.
[time=1200] But the great truth of God's word and what we've seen already in our study here is that God can save us and he does.
[time=1207] He saves, he offers and he brings this unspeakable miracle of personal spiritual rescue.
[time=1214] And we went on in our study.
[time=1217] Look at verses 13 through 16.
[time=1218] We were there last week.
[time=1220] So Peter now continues wanting to encourage and remind them.
[time=1224] He says, yes, you are saved, but in your response and you're thinking, don't stop there.
[time=1231] You need to respond to what God has done.
[time=1234] You need to live out this salvation.
[time=1237] Therefore prepare your minds for action.
[time=1240] Keep sober in spirit.
[time=1241] Remember, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=1248] As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts, which were yours in your ignorance.
[time=1256] But like the Holy One who called you, be not do, be holy yourselves.
[time=1262] Also in all your behavior, because it is written, you shall be holy for I am holy.
[time=1269] He writes for them and for you and I that if we're going to stay faithful in the midst of heartache, if we're going to follow him when it might be easier to leave him, if we're going to endure persecution and not cave into the hostility of evil, we must respond daily.
[time=1290] We must respond to this great gift.
[time=1294] And I showed you two things last week.
[time=1296] And this morning, before we move on to our next passage, to our next section of this book, I wanna just finish up what we didn't finish last week.
[time=1306] Now you can just write this down if you want to.
[time=1307] We saw last week that this response to our salvation should be marked by number one, a hope fixed on him.
[time=1316] You see it there in verse 13.
[time=1318] Prepare your minds, keep sober in spirit so that you can fix, remember your eyes?
[time=1324] Remember the military term, your eyes fixed right here, right here, not over there, not over there, not up there?
[time=1329] No, eyes fixed straight ahead.
[time=1332] Attention and focus and dedication to that which is before you, the person of Christ, Hebrews said, fix your eyes on the author and perfecter of your faith.
[time=1346] Peter here tells the readers and you and I to fix, to secure our hope, that which we're banking on, some wanna fix their hope on money, some wanna fix their hope on a spouse, some wanna fix their hope on a career, some wanna fix their hope on all kinds of things.
[time=1363] He says, no, none of it's gonna hold you up, none of it's gonna come through for you, none of it's going to bring fulfillment.
[time=1369] No, fix eyes right here, fix your hope on me, a fixed hope.
[time=1374] The first response we saw there.
[time=1377] Secondly, a holiness, a personal holiness in living,
[time=1383] a holiness of heart, we must respond
[time=1389] with an ever deepening abiding relationship with him.
[time=1393] If you weren't here last week, let me just tell you that real quick.
[time=1395] It isn't about doing holiness, it's about being in relationship with him.
[time=1401] And when you and I are in a growing deepening relationship with him, when our hearts are being grown, when our understanding of God's truth, when the living out of that truth is becoming more and more of an embraced pattern in our lives, when you and I are worshiping him and reading him and listening to him and being held accountable to him and living in community with others, with a focus and an intention of growing in him when we deepen and grow our relationship with him, it changes what we do, it changes how we think, it changes how we respond, we become to be holy.
[time=1439] A response of holiness and a response of hope.
[time=1445] And this morning, I wanna just give you one last response.
[time=1448] Before we move on.
[time=1450] One more response to this great salvation we didn't get to last week, verse 17.
[time=1456] If you address it says right there, "You shall be holy for I am holy." And if verse 17, if you address as father, the one who impartially judges according to each one's work, then conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth.
[time=1476] We must respond to salvation, my friends, with hope fixed on him.
[time=1481] Holiness that is born out of a deepening relationship with him and honor, write it down, honor.
[time=1490] We must honor him.
[time=1494] You know, it's interesting to think about the culture that Peter writes in, as he pens this letter, obviously God has preserved these words for us today, but he writes to a first century audience, as most of you I'm sure are aware of.
[time=1510] And as I talked this week with a friend, I was reminded of the fact that Peter writes to, think about it, he writes to Jewish believers.
[time=1519] He writes to Greek believers,
[time=1525] and he writes to Roman believers.
[time=1529] And as you think about this word, he uses there in verse 17.
[time=1531] If you address as father, you see it there?
[time=1536] If you address as father, the one who impartially judges, it's amazing how all three cultures that Peter would be writing to had a very high, all three of them, Jews, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, had a very high view, a very escalated view of fathers.
[time=1556] You take the Hebrew culture, for instance, in Jewish culture, the word spoke of the one who gave strength and stability to the family, to the Greeks, great esteem and honor were placed on the father.
[time=1572] I learned this week that in some Greek provinces, bachelorhood was against the law.
[time=1578] How you doing?
[time=1580] Yeah, when you were breaking the law, if you weren't married, I mean they really, really thought highly, and you needed to get married, you needed to have some kid, you needed to be a father.
[time=1593] Fathers were esteemed, fathers were lifted up.
[time=1597] For Romans, the father was the supreme master of the home and the family.
[time=1601] And so the term father, in all three settings, brought with it a great deal of honor and respect.
[time=1609] And so spiritually, it would make all the sense in the world to those Peter's addressing to conduct themselves in fear.
[time=1621] Fear of this father.
[time=1625] Fear that he would, fear that he would slap you.
[time=1630] No, fear that he would hit you, fear that he would abandon you, fear that he was angry at you.
[time=1638] No, this is not the fear that the Bible speaks of here.
[time=1642] This is a fear, you see it there.
[time=1644] If you address the father as the one who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear.
[time=1652] This fear, this biblical fear that Peter talks about here is a fear, maybe better worded to be a great reverence.
[time=1663] Great reverence.
[time=1667] You ever been in the, maybe you haven't.
[time=1670] There've been a few times in my life where I've been in the room with someone who I revered greatly.
[time=1676] I felt it way beyond that in my heart this morning, sitting in here with you all as we sang of our great, our great God.
[time=1687] There should be a healthy sense of reverence in you and me, my friends, that has to do with the fact that he is so other than you and me.
[time=1698] He is so much bigger.
[time=1700] He is so much greater.
[time=1702] He is so much more amazing, so full of love, so full of justice, so full of greatness.
[time=1709] It's just like, whoa, I am me and you are you and I can't believe you want to be close to me.
[time=1715] There's that reverence, right?
[time=1720] Living in fear, living with great reverence.
[time=1723] There's a deep awe, a deep, deep sense of all.
[time=1728] Oh my goodness, the first time you saw the Grand Canyon, I mean, the first time you saw the Pacific, I mean, the first time you saw whatever it is you saw that made you step back and go, oh my goodness.
[time=1743] I mean, it's just that a million times over because he's who he is.
[time=1750] There is this consuming respect that comes in this biblical fear.
[time=1756] I mean, you and I are consumed with respect for him.
[time=1761] There is a reverential awe.
[time=1764] And here's the point, you got to keep it tied to the text.
[time=1767] See, why would there be such honor given?
[time=1770] Why would there be such awe?
[time=1772] Why would we respond to him with such reverence because he saved you?
[time=1780] Because he gave you the gift that nobody else could give you because he did for you what you couldn't do for yourself.
[time=1788] He saved you, praise God.
[time=1792] It's not really difficult to, I mean, it's very elementary.
[time=1796] It's what you would do, it's how you would respond.
[time=1801] On a much smaller scale, right, I've told you the story before.
[time=1806] Most of you, I'm sure, heard me tell it.
[time=1808] There was a seventh grade small group of boys that I very first, it was my first ministry assignment ever.
[time=1816] It was the assignment that clinched it for me.
[time=1818] It was the opportunity that convinced me I was going to be in ministry.
[time=1823] And those seventh grade boys and their families took me skiing.
[time=1827] We went out to the lake one day out in California.
[time=1829] Long story short, one of the moms of the boys, we were out swimming.
[time=1833] We were out in the boat.
[time=1834] Everybody was swimming to shore and she started to drown.
[time=1838] She got cramped up and we left her and we got almost all the way in.
[time=1842] I looked back and I saw a hand going up and down.
[time=1845] I freaked out, swam as fast as I could, got out there too.
[time=1848] It all turned out okay.
[time=1850] She tried to kill me first when I got there.
[time=1854] We got that all worked out.
[time=1856] It knocked her around a little bit.
[time=1859] And put her on my back and we swam to shore.
[time=1862] It was amazing.
[time=1864] I don't know if you've done that before.
[time=1865] I had never done it and I haven't done it since.
[time=1867] But I tell you, I'll never forget the feeling of laying her down on the beach and having the family and medics come and she was good to go.
[time=1875] She was all right.
[time=1877] Her name was Glenda.
[time=1879] That was 22 years ago.
[time=1882] They still live in that community.
[time=1885] I still go back there, you know.
[time=1887] You know, I go back there often and I'll speak or I'll go back to play golf in January or whatever I do out there.
[time=1895] And I see her.
[time=1897] It's just the oddest thing.
[time=1899] I don't see her every time, but it's like in the last two, three, four years, I've seen her three, four, five times.
[time=1905] I'll see her in restaurants.
[time=1907] I'll see her downtown.
[time=1909] I mean, I see her.
[time=1911] Last time I saw her, we read a restaurant.
[time=1913] Me and a buddy.
[time=1914] And she's in the restaurant, other side of the restaurant, with two of her daughters.
[time=1918] And they see me and they stand up and they come across.
[time=1921] It's the same old thing every time.
[time=1923] They come across the restaurant, tears in all three of their eyes.
[time=1926] And I start to cry and she holds her arms out and I stand up.
[time=1929] And she squeezes me and she's knocking me on the back of the head.
[time=1933] And she just says things, you know.
[time=1935] She says things way too nice, you know, stuff she shouldn't say about me.
[time=1938] And her daughters cry and she cries and I cry and she always just says thank you.
[time=1943] She thinks about the 22 years.
[time=1949] Because somebody what?
[time=1951] Somebody saved her.
[time=1954] And I don't know how grateful you are or how many times you say it or express it.
[time=1960] But there is an honor that comes.
[time=1962] There is an honor that should be in our response as we call upon our father.
[time=1967] It's an amazing thing.
[time=1970] So my friends, church, respond like that.
[time=1977] Respond like that to this amazing gift that he has given you.
[time=1983] Fix your eyes right there.
[time=1985] Don't go over here.
[time=1987] No, fix your hope on him.
[time=1992] Offer him in response to what he's done a life that's growing in a relationship with him
[time=1998] so it can be holy and honor him.
[time=2004] Live life with that reverential sense of awe and give him the respect that he's due.
[time=2012] Knowing, here you go, knowing that you have been, now we're going to kind of transition here to our passage for this morning.
[time=2019] Knowing that you have been my favorite word in the entire Bible.
[time=2027] Knowing that you have been redeemed.
[time=2031] My friends, if you know him this morning, you have been redeemed.
[time=2035] And it is my favorite word in the entire Bible.
[time=2040] We come to our next passage in our journey through 1 Peter.
[time=2044] And let me read it for you this morning as we talk about what it means to be redeemed.
[time=2049] Would you stand in honor of God's word in reverent awe of him and these ancient words
[time=2056] ever true?
[time=2058] And would you let me read this for you?
[time=2060] 1 Peter 1 verses 18 to 21.
[time=2063] I'll go back to 17.
[time=2064] If you address us, Father, the one who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct
[time=2070] yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth, knowing this, knowing that
[time=2077] you've been redeemed, knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, no, you were redeemed
[time=2089] in verse 19 with precious blood.
[time=2093] As of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ, for he Christ was foreknown
[time=2101] before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who through him, not of yourselves, right?
[time=2112] It is a gift who through him are believers in God who raised him from the dead and gave
[time=2118] him glory so that your faith and your what, hope are in God.
[time=2127] Father, we humbly and gratefully, in this morning God respectfully stand before you, our awesome
[time=2141] and mighty King, and we have no business standing before you, God, in and of ourselves, we have
[time=2148] no business being near you, much less in a relationship with you, but God, you redeemed
[time=2156] us.
[time=2157] God, you loved us, and God, you brought this great salvation, and as we continue this morning to learn and see more about that, God prepare our hearts to respond even further.
[time=2168] God grow us and change us, help us to live like saved people, help us to live like the
[time=2174] redeemed, and we'll thank you for it in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=2179] You can be seated.
[time=2181] I know it might sound a little corny, but it's just I couldn't think of any way else to say it, my favorite word in the entire Bible, and it got me thinking, I got a lot of favorites
[time=2192] in my life.
[time=2193] I got tons of favorites, I sure you do as well.
[time=2197] A favorite color, my favorite color is blue, it's always been blue ever since I can remember I've loved the color blue.
[time=2203] My favorite food, you know what, to be perfectly honest with you, my favorite food is any kind
[time=2210] of cereal at night after 10 p.m., can anybody identify with that, say amen.
[time=2215] Gosh, it's good, isn't it?
[time=2217] There's just nothing like a bowl of cereal late at night, you just kill like half the box, and you know, and the wife and kids get up in the morning going, "Where's the milk?" Oh, I love it, cereal at night after 10.
[time=2231] My favorite Bible character, hands down, no questions asked, Joseph has always been my
[time=2237] favorite story, he's always been my favorite dude, I mean, that guy was amazing.
[time=2243] Maybe we'll study him sometime here soon.
[time=2245] If I had to eat steak, I'd eat a ribeye, my favorite teams are the Raiders and the Lakers,
[time=2252] no need to say anything, just let me move on here.
[time=2256] We'll be back, don't worry about it.
[time=2260] Oh, my favorite time of the year here in Indiana, I've been here almost 10 years now, I can speak to this with great clarity.
[time=2267] My favorite time of the year in Indiana is that one day in late May when it's hot and there's no mosquitoes yet, it's amazing, yeah, I mean, it's just like a little window
[time=2279] right there, and then all of a sudden, you're back to hitting yourself, but there's that one day in late May that I long for, oh my goodness, my favorite relative, I've told
[time=2293] you about him before, my grandpa Joe, what he taught me, what he showed me, the way he
[time=2299] loved me, my grandpa Joe, I mean, my mom and dad, they're obviously, you know how I feel about them as far as beyond them, grandpa Joe would be it, my favorite worship leader,
[time=2312] right there, just above Tommy Walker, Chris Tomlin, Matt Redman, and Stephen Curtis Chapman
[time=2318] would be Corbin Miller, yeah, absolutely, thank God for Corbin, thank God that you realize
[time=2325] almost three years ago, he brought us Corbin and Tanya Miller, at a time when we didn't
[time=2332] know, I didn't know what we were going to do, and you know how that is, he does, and
[time=2339] he has all that figured out, and he brings just the right people, just the right time,
[time=2345] just the right place, and boy, what he has done in you and me, how he has grown us in
[time=2353] our worship through a wonderful kid who's growing in wisdom beyond his years, I'm so
[time=2363] thankful for him, my favorite thing in the world to do, that was a tough one, but if
[time=2369] I had to tell you my favorite thing in the world to do, it would be rough house with all five kids on my bed at one time, that's one of the funnest things I can even imagine,
[time=2380] and we have such a great time, my favorite human being would be my wife, my favorite memory would probably be those five births, there's just for me, nothing, I just have
[time=2392] never seen anything experience, anything like a birth, my favorite verse, Job 40 verse 4,
[time=2404] and my favorite word in the entire Bible is redemption, and I don't know if you understand
[time=2414] redemption like I've grown to understand redemption in recent years, but I love the word I love
[time=2422] the truth about redemption, I love the picture and the story of redemption, redemption leaves
[time=2429] me speechless, redemption leaves me deeply grateful, redemption my friends is an amazing,
[time=2441] amazing truth, do you know what it means?
[time=2446] Let me do my best to explain it to you if I can here as we look at this passage here
[time=2453] in 1 Peter, and to do that, can I just take you back to, I think this will be on the screen,
[time=2460] could you go back in your Bibles to Hosea, let me try my best to paint a biblical picture
[time=2467] of redemption, and we're going to do that as we look back at the prophet Hosea, it says
[time=2474] in Hosea, you there, it might even be on the screen, there you go, and Hosea 1, 2, first of all, God calls Hosea to speak as He did with the prophets, God has a message for the people of Israel, and He calls upon Hosea, and when the Lord first spoke through Hosea,
[time=2490] the Lord said to Hosea, "Go, take to yourself a wife of harlotry," I want you to see that
[time=2498] there, it's not a misprint, he says to Hosea, "Go, Hosea, and marry a prostitute."
[time=2507] Not one who used to be, not one who might be, no, I want you to go and marry one who
[time=2513] is, a harlot, and I want you to, go ahead, just take a minute here and just try and start
[time=2520] putting yourselves in His sandals, I want you to serve me, I want you to honor me, I want
[time=2528] you to represent me, and as we get going here, I want you to go marry a prostitute, and have watched this, and have children of love, have children of marriage, yes, no, no, and have
[time=2545] children of harlotry.
[time=2548] In other words, she'll continue in her prostitution and she will have children out of that prostitution
[time=2559] and they will be yours.
[time=2563] Go take to yourself a wife of harlotry and have children of harlotry.
[time=2568] For the land commits flagrant harlotry for saking the Lord.
[time=2573] See, he is going to, as Hosea lives this out, he is going to exemplify the unfaithfulness
[time=2579] of his people, how they had wandered from what was true, how they had given themselves to another, or even others.
[time=2589] And Hosea's life and his experience will be a firsthand account.
[time=2594] So he went and took Gomer, that's her name, Gomer, the daughter of Deblame, and she conceived
[time=2600] and bore him his son, and the Lord said to him, name him Jezreel for yet a little while, and I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
[time=2612] On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
[time=2616] Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter, and the Lord said to him, name her lo ruhama, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, but I would ever forgive
[time=2626] them, but I will have compassion on the house of Judah, and deliver them by the Lord their God, and will not deliver them by bow sword, battle horses, or horsemen, and when she had weaned lo ruhama, she conceived and gave birth to a son, and the Lord said, name him
[time=2642] lo am I, for you are not my people, it had gotten bad, and I am not your God.
[time=2654] And so this goes on, and as you read through the story of Hosea, and as you begin to get
[time=2661] a picture of the unfaithfulness of Israel and the unfaithfulness of his wife, you begin
[time=2667] to see the extent to which this unfaithfulness went, the depths to which it sunk, and then
[time=2676] we come to chapter 3 and an amazing picture of redemption.
[time=2681] I don't want you to miss this.
[time=2686] Then the Lord said to me, chapter 3 verse 1, some time has transpired here, obviously,
[time=2692] as the text unfolds, then the Lord said to me, go again, love a woman who is loved by her husband, yet an adulterous, even as the Lord loves the sons of Israel, go again, love
[time=2704] a woman who is loved by her husband, yet an adulterous, even as the Lord loves the sons
[time=2711] of Israel, though they turn to other gods, though she turns to other men, and though
[time=2718] they love raising cakes, so I watch, so I say that word, so I what?
[time=2724] So I bought her for myself for 15 shekels of silver, and a homer, and a half of barley.
[time=2732] My friends, why did he, what happened here?
[time=2738] Why did he, why did he have to buy her?
[time=2743] Where had she gone?
[time=2747] I mean, what had transpired that, that leads Hosea and now to have to come into this, into the situation where he's buying her back?
[time=2756] See, what would have transpired in that day and, and what still transpires in many ways
[time=2763] is that she would have been so given to her prostitution.
[time=2767] She would have been so given to this debauched, empty, horrible lifestyle that she would
[time=2774] have gone down that road so far that in time, that in time she would become used up.
[time=2788] In time she would be so beaten down, in time she would be so at the end of herself, that
[time=2796] she would no longer even be attractive for the purposes to which she had come to serve.
[time=2803] And when a woman got to that point, then she would be treated like cattle.
[time=2809] I mean, she was just nothing.
[time=2813] And so she would, whoever owned her then, whoever had her at that point would just pretty much give her to the slave auction, which they would have there in town, where servants and slaves could be purchased.
[time=2824] And this woman who was once beautiful and full of life now is practically dead and completely
[time=2832] run down and she stands there.
[time=2835] She would have in that day and in that custom, she would have stood there on the block without clothes in chains, head bowed, beaten and almost dead, his wife.
[time=2850] She goes to the market and he pays the price to bring her home.
[time=2858] And that is the amazing picture.
[time=2864] That my friends is redemption.
[time=2870] The Greek word, you might want to write this down, the Greek word is "letreto." And it means, listen, you can write it down, redeemed.
[time=2878] It means to purchase freedom or to purchase release by the payment or provision of a ransom.
[time=2888] It means to deliver by the payment of a price to the Greeks in that day.
[time=2892] It was the offering of money for the release of a prisoner of war.
[time=2899] How's that sound?
[time=2901] Sound familiar at all?
[time=2902] I mean, are you able to in your heart and mind this morning kind of connect?
[time=2909] What Hosea was willing to do for Gomer with what God was willing to do for you?
[time=2918] He bought you back.
[time=2924] Thomas Watson, the great Puritan writer, said that redemption was God's greatest work.
[time=2928] He said, great was the work of creation, but greater the work of redemption.
[time=2934] It cost more to redeem us, Watson said, than it did to make us.
[time=2940] In the one, there was but the speaking of a word.
[time=2943] In the other, the shedding of a son's blood.
[time=2947] Redemption, my friends, being redeemed.
[time=2951] This word, this concept, this truth, it deals with, hear me.
[time=2955] The cost, so you and I can't forget, there was a cost to this great salvation that you
[time=2963] and I have.
[time=2964] This is the cost of salvation and the means by which God received payment.
[time=2973] That's right.
[time=2974] Now listen, if all people, if all people left to themselves are helpless, hopeless, slaves
[time=2982] to sin, now I don't know if you agree with that statement, I do.
[time=2991] I agree with that statement because God's Word says that's true.
[time=2996] We'll look at that as we continue through this passage.
[time=3000] I believe that statement to be true because God's Word says it's true.
[time=3004] I then believe it to be true because I see it every single day.
[time=3012] If all people left to themselves are hopeless, helpless, slaves to sin, watch standing condemned
[time=3020] in their chains on the block, the only way they can be forgiven, the only way they can
[time=3027] be reconciled to a right relationship with God is if he buys us back and the only price,
[time=3037] it's amazing because he said it.
[time=3040] The only price that was acceptable, the only price that is acceptable for buying you back
[time=3046] off the block is the perfect blood of the perfect lamb, the perfect redeeming sacrifice.
[time=3055] It's the only thing that gets it done.
[time=3062] Now it's amazing as you think about it, it's amazing that as Peter writes this and as he
[time=3068] begins to talk about it and remind us of this great redemption I was reading just last night
[time=3076] how Peter because of who he was and because of his background and because of his lineage and because of his understanding of these great truths, Peter's understanding of redemption obviously had some history to it.
[time=3088] Let me just tell you, there is great, great history to this truth of redemption.
[time=3094] And he draws upon, I'm sure, a number of different sources but one that I believe you'll find not only fascinating and interesting but it is so profound is Exodus chapter 12.
[time=3105] You can turn there if you'd like.
[time=3107] Exodus chapter 12, Exodus chapter 12 verses 1 to 13, you want to understand the fundamental
[time=3116] nature of redemption, you want to really understand where this comes from, you want to see with your own eyes and your own heart what this is born out of, then look at Exodus chapter 12, we'll look at verses 1 to 13, in fact why don't we do this just in reverent respect
[time=3136] why don't you stand and please don't leave here, we'll prepare to go here in just a moment
[time=3142] but let's just stand, let me read this for you, a passage entitled the Passover Lamb,
[time=3150] Exodus 12.
[time=3151] Now the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "In the land of Egypt this month shall be the beginning of months for you." It is to be the first month of the year to you, speak to all the congregation of Israel saying on the 10th of this month they are each one to take a lamb for themselves according to their father's households, a lamb for each household.
[time=3172] Now if the household is too small for a lamb then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to take one according to the number of persons in them according to what each man should eat, you are to divide the lamb.
[time=3184] Your lamb shall be an unblemished perfect spotless male, you see it there, an unblemished male,
[time=3196] a year old, you may take it from the sheep or from the goats, you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is
[time=3207] to kill it at twilight.
[time=3209] Moreover they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two door posts and on the lentil of the houses in which they eat it, they shall eat the flesh that same night roasted with fire and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water but rather roasted with fire both its head and its legs
[time=3231] along with its entrails and you shall not leave any of it over until morning but whatever
[time=3239] is left of it until morning you shall burn with fire.
[time=3242] Now you shall eat it in this manner, watch this, when I read this verse I think about
[time=3248] God's call on you and me to live in this world as aliens, when I read this verse I think
[time=3256] about how we're not to get connected to this place, we're not to sink roots too far deep
[time=3262] you know, in this place, listen to what he says, now you shall eat it in this manner with your loins girded, sound familiar, with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet and
[time=3273] your staff in your hand, ready to what, ready to travel, I love that and you shall eat
[time=3283] it in haste, don't let your kids read that part right there.
[time=3288] It is the Lord's, say it, Passover, for I will go through the land of Egypt on that
[time=3295] night and I will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments, I am the Lord.
[time=3306] The blood shall be assigned for you on the houses where you live and when I see the blood I will pass over you and no plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike the land
[time=3319] of Egypt.
[time=3321] Listen, the lamb's life was the price required to spare the life of the Israelite family's
[time=3330] firstborn child.
[time=3331] The lamb was a divinely ordained illustration and its sacrifice typified the sacrificial
[time=3338] death of an innocent substitute that redeemed those in bondage.
[time=3346] This Passover event immediately became the symbol of a substitutionary redemption and
[time=3352] God further decreed that Israel annually celebrate Passover to perpetually remind the nation of
[time=3359] his powerful deliverance of her from Egypt and to point the people toward the true lamb
[time=3366] who would one day die and rise again as the perfect and final substitutionary sacrifice
[time=3373] to redeem sinners with his blood, his blood.
[time=3380] The Israelites remembered the first Passover as God's greatest display of redeeming power
[time=3387] up to that time.
[time=3388] They said in Exodus 15, 13, they said, "In your loving kindness you have led the people whom you have redeemed.
[time=3397] But as great as that redemption was, as great as that redemption was, the one about which
[time=3407] Peter writes in our passage here infinitely surpasses that.
[time=3417] It's as if to reemphasize the greatness of God's salvation, Peter here in our passage
[time=3423] provides believers with an understanding, a theology, if you will, of redemption.
[time=3429] And I can't wait till next week, we'll come back and I can't wait to talk to you about.
[time=3433] I can't wait to teach you.
[time=3434] I can't wait to open God's Word and have you see what we've been redeemed from.
[time=3439] The passage talks about it.
[time=3440] You just see it right there in 1 Peter 1, 18 to 21.
[time=3443] We're going to see what we've been redeemed from, what we've been redeemed with, and what we have been redeemed for.
[time=3449] And I hope you'll join us.
[time=3450] Would you bow and can we pray as we go this morning?
[time=3457] I don't know what's on your heart here as we leave today, but I pray to God that if there are things in your heart and mind today that you need to talk about, if there are questions that you need to ask, if there are decisions that you need to make, I pray that
[time=3472] you would come and allow us the privilege of doing that.
[time=3474] I pray that you would speak with a trusted friend.
[time=3477] I pray that you could continue on this journey that God has you on.
[time=3484] There's things that we can do to help please allow us the privilege of doing so.
[time=3488] And God, I pray as we leave this place today, as we walk out these doors, God, we pray that you would remind us of these truths, bring us back again in the days, even the hours to come, God, bring us back to this great truth of your salvation and your redemption.
[time=3503] God, the willingness that you possess to buy us back when we were so ugly, when we were
[time=3510] so sinful.
[time=3511] God, when we were so detached and distant from you, whether that was when we were 10 dead
[time=3518] in our humanness or whether we were 20 and lost in rebellion, God, thank you for paying
[time=3526] the price to buy us back and giving us this life with you.
[time=3532] God, keep us safe and God, bring us back together if that be your will and thank you so very much for the people that we're meeting and the opportunities you're giving us to help seeking people, find and know what it means to follow you.
[time=3547] We thank you for it and pray, God, that you watch over us as we leave in your son's name we pray.
[time=3552] [AMEN] Thank you.
[time=3557] God bless you.
[time=3586] the Lord.
[time=3616] God bless you.
[time=3646] the Lord.
[time=3677] God bless you.
[time=3706] the Lord.
[time=3738] God bless you.
[time=3766] the Lord.
