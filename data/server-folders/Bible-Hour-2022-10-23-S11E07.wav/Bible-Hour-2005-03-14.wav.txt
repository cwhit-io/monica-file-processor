[time=292] - Before we sing the verse to this song,
[time=299] let's do the chorus one more time and sing it with all your heart.
[time=303] [MUSIC - 258 seconds]
[time=569] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=578] I'm so thankful that you've tuned in and we're so thankful that we have the opportunity to bring this broadcast to you week after week.
[time=586] We are coming up on a week here that's probably one of the most important weeks in the year.
[time=593] Many of you are aware of the fact that this week in these next seven days, this is the week that leads to Resurrection Sunday.
[time=602] This is the week when our Lord, Jesus Christ, where He came closer and closer and then eventually made His way to Jerusalem.
[time=610] This is when He makes His triumphal entry.
[time=613] This is when He meets with the disciples in the upper room and this is in fact the week when His earthly life came to an end when He was willing to make the amazing sacrifice that He made.
[time=625] So you and I could have life.
[time=627] And then having made that sacrifice, having given His life, this is the week that He goes into the tomb and three days later, conquers death.
[time=637] We are so grateful for what He did and we are so looking forward to celebrating these great events.
[time=644] I want to invite you to come and be with us on Friday night.
[time=647] We're doing something a little different this year.
[time=650] We're gonna have a good Friday service.
[time=652] We've normally had those midday.
[time=654] This year we're gonna have it at 6.30 p.m.
[time=657] right here in our worship center and the Blackhawk family is absolutely thrilled and privileged to have joining us this year, Pathway Community Church and St. Joe Community Church.
[time=670] All three churches, all three families, all coming together on that Friday night at 6.30 to remember what Jesus did, to remember and to ponder the sacrifice that He made.
[time=684] We will be serving communion that night.
[time=687] It'll be a night of worship and reflection and we would love for you to come and join us that night.
[time=693] You may have been thinking about coming in weeks or months past.
[time=697] That would be a great night for you to come and not only meet us, but you get to meet some amazing people from these other churches, places that we have great respect for and we are so thankful that they are coming that night to join in that celebration with us.
[time=710] And then on Sunday morning, my goodness, we are so looking forward to Resurrection Sunday, an opportunity to celebrate as the people of God, the fact that Christ conquered death.
[time=723] And because He conquered death, we will conquer death because He did what He did.
[time=729] We have the privilege of not only relationship with God today, but a future, an eternity that has been secured.
[time=737] And we're gonna celebrate that in a way that I can't wait and come and join us.
[time=742] Nine o'clock or 1045, the 1045 will probably be pretty packed.
[time=749] The nine o'clock one I'm assuming will be as well, but we've got room for you.
[time=753] Again, if you don't have a church home, if you're looking for a place to really celebrate Easter, come and be with us, nine and 1045 on Sunday morning.
[time=763] We'd love to meet you.
[time=764] We would love to have you here.
[time=765] We would love nothing more than to celebrate that great day with you.
[time=770] So come and join us.
[time=771] Thank you so very much for tuning in.
[time=773] God bless you and have a great week.
[time=776] (upbeat music)
[time=789] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=817] And they wonder why we do the things we do.
[time=825] It's all because of this.
[time=832] We're taste and birth, taste and hope.
[time=836] It's all because of this.
[time=845] We're taste and birth, taste and hope.
[time=849] Taste and hope again.
[time=853] They wonder why we do the things we do.
[time=873] Well, as the screen said there at the end, first Peter, when holiness meets hostility, we want to welcome you back to our ongoing study of this amazing book.
[time=884] Well, hey, let me invite you to open a first Peter.
[time=887] First Peter chapter one, when we learned last week about my favorite word, I told you that last week, I'll tell you it again, my favorite word, my favorite, one of my favorite truths in the entire scriptures.
[time=899] Last week, we learned about and begin a discussion about the truth of redemption.
[time=904] I love the word redeemed.
[time=906] And last week, we learned that God has redeemed us.
[time=910] We spent the entirety of our time together.
[time=913] Last week, kind of just talking about, learning about, kind of, bringing to light this great truth of redemption.
[time=919] We didn't even quite get to the passage, which we will today.
[time=923] But I want to just remind you that we learned last week that God has redeemed you.
[time=931] If in fact you're here this morning and you have a personal relationship with him, if you've been saved, you have been redeemed.
[time=939] And what that means is this, a price.
[time=943] A price was paid.
[time=945] A price was paid for your salvation.
[time=950] It's the great truth behind redemption.
[time=952] A price was paid.
[time=956] Why?
[time=959] Let me ask you that as we start this morning.
[time=961] Why?
[time=962] Why was it that a price had to be paid for you and I to be redeemed?
[time=969] Well, you know why?
[time=971] I'll answer that question for you in a word because God is just.
[time=977] That's right.
[time=978] Don't forget this morning that God is just.
[time=983] He's loving, that's true, and he's merciful, that's true.
[time=987] And he's full of amazing grace, that's true.
[time=989] But he is also a just God who doesn't cut any corners.
[time=997] Think about it with me.
[time=998] He gave us, go back to the beginning, he gave us choice, right?
[time=1002] In the garden with Adam and Eve, he gave us choice then and he continues to give us choice today.
[time=1007] And you see, back then in the garden and now today here still with our choice, they chose and now we continue to choose sin.
[time=1016] With choice came sin.
[time=1019] And with sin, with disobedience comes a distance between man and God.
[time=1024] See what was in the garden prior to the fall, a perfect relationship.
[time=1030] Unhendered, unbroken is now severed in the presence of sin.
[time=1038] And with disobedience and sin comes a distance now between God and man.
[time=1044] A broken relationship that can only be restored by payment.
[time=1051] It's the great truth of redemption.
[time=1053] A payment to cover the debt, a payment to bridge the distance, the distance of my sin.
[time=1061] Remember, he's a holy, perfect, sinless God and he stands separated from man
[time=1067] and his sin and reconciliation, the two being brought back together.
[time=1072] Restoration of that severed relationship, it demands a payment.
[time=1077] And God doesn't cut corners.
[time=1079] He's just.
[time=1081] A payment had to be made if you and I were going to be saved from our sin.
[time=1087] And God reaches into his pocket, so to speak, and he pays it.
[time=1092] He pays it all.
[time=1095] He gave his only begotten son, John 3 16.
[time=1098] He allowed Jesus Christ to suffer and die as payment for our sin because he said, you know,
[time=1105] from the very beginning that sin required a payment.
[time=1109] And so he redeems us.
[time=1114] He redeems us.
[time=1116] And I want to ask you a question this morning before we get started.
[time=1121] And you'll see this question on the screen later.
[time=1125] It's not going to come up now, but I just want you to think about it with me as we start.
[time=1129] Because you see, in this morning's time, I want you to first of all ask this question.
[time=1133] We've talked about the great truth of redemption.
[time=1136] We realize a price has been paid.
[time=1138] It had to be because he's just.
[time=1142] But I want you to think about this with me today.
[time=1144] What is it that you were redeemed from?
[time=1155] And I think there's two reasons that I feel like we should ask this question this morning.
[time=1161] Two reasons why I should ask you and you should ask me, hey, wait a minute.
[time=1165] What have we been redeemed from?
[time=1168] Number one is this, many of you in the room this morning have been redeemed.
[time=1172] Praise God?
[time=1174] [AMEN] Many of you in the room this morning have felt the glory, have felt the relief, have felt the joy of being redeemed, and you and I need to be reminded of what he did.
[time=1185] You need to see again where you were, the condition you were in, and what God rescued you from.
[time=1194] See every once in a while, it's good to just stop and take note of what he saved you and I out of so that today we can be deeply and profoundly grateful.
[time=1207] The other reason to ask what are we redeemed from is that there are others of you here today and you haven't been redeemed yet.
[time=1219] Let's say it that way.
[time=1223] There are some of you in the room today and you have not been redeemed yet.
[time=1230] You haven't surrendered fully your heart and life to him.
[time=1234] You're still contemplating faith in Christ, still considering bowing the knee of your heart to him.
[time=1239] And truth be told, you sometimes feel as if you might be beyond redemption.
[time=1248] I know that about you, A, I know that because I felt that way, B, I know that because we
[time=1259] talk.
[time=1262] You so graciously week after week, month after month in our relationship so many times you're
[time=1268] willing to share with me and others here the honest reality of your heart.
[time=1273] And there are some of you in this room I know you see the ugliness of your sin.
[time=1278] You live in the guilt and shame that comes with it.
[time=1281] And you're pretty convinced that there's no price, you're pretty convinced that there's
[time=1288] no price that could ever cover the size of your personal sin account.
[time=1295] And you know what, both groups of people today need to hear that message.
[time=1300] The redeemed need to hear this message and those not yet redeemed need to hear this message.
[time=1305] You need to and I need to understand the truth about redemption.
[time=1311] So let's start in.
[time=1313] First Peter chapter 1 verses 18 to 21 and before we get into our outline today, would
[time=1319] you stand with me in honor of God's word and allow me to read this for you.
[time=1325] First Peter chapter 1, we're going to actually start in verse 17.
[time=1329] First Peter 1 verse 17 and we're going to go on through verse 21.
[time=1334] It says in first Peter 1 verse 17, it says, "If you address as Father, the one who impartially
[time=1342] judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your
[time=1348] stay on earth, knowing this, knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers.
[time=1360] But, but what, but you were redeemed with precious blood, but you were redeemed with
[time=1368] precious blood as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.
[time=1374] For he Christ was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last
[time=1380] times for the sake of you who, verse 21, who through him, who through Christ are believers
[time=1386] in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and your hope
[time=1396] would be in God, so that your faith and hope are in God."
[time=1403] Pray with me, would you Father as we humbly stand here before you this morning, our prayer
[time=1410] is that you would move in the hearts and lives of the redeemed.
[time=1415] God having realized the price that has been paid, would you please, God, in your great
[time=1422] mercy and with your great strength, would you move us along in our walk with you, God would you teach us today, would you help paint a picture in our mind's eye, would it become please more clearly able to be understood, God, what it means and looks like, to live
[time=1440] and to choose and to think as a redeemed follower of Christ?
[time=1447] God we fall so short there at times and we want to understand it and we desire God to see it, so help paint that picture through your word, God allow us to see the redeemed
[time=1458] life and God for those here, not yet redeemed, for those here who haven't fully surrendered
[time=1464] God whatever questions they might have, God whatever concerns may be brewing in their minds or in their hearts, God whatever it is they might be holding on to, we pray that
[time=1475] your spirit would be at work and if in fact you are drawing them to yourself, God we pray you would do that and we pray God that we would not hinder that but God that we would help that, that we could encourage that and we'll look forward to seeing what you'll do in the days to come in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1493] You can be seated.
[time=1494] Well let's just ask a few questions this morning, we'll ask three in fact number one, I've already
[time=1500] kind of let you in on it, what are we redeemed from, write that down, what are we redeemed from and we find the answer right there in verse 18, it says knowing that you were not
[time=1511] redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold, here it is, from your futile way
[time=1519] of life, says it right there, we have been redeemed, the scripture teaches and Peter
[time=1526] reminds us here, from a futile way of life, Peter goes on to say a futile way of life
[time=1535] inherited from your forefathers, our passage says that we've been redeemed, we've been saved from a useless, if you look at that word futile in the Greek you realize it's
[time=1546] a word that means useless, it means it means worthless, most importantly and the
[time=1554] one I connected most with was it means an empty existence, God's word teaches you
[time=1560] in either this morning that we have been saved from futility, that in redemption and fully surrendering our hearts and lives to Him, we've been freed from an empty life.
[time=1570] Now it's very important that we understand this, it's very important that we take a
[time=1576] minute and talk about this this morning because these words, this definition of futility, this
[time=1583] useless, worthless, empty life, these words they bring life, your life and mine into clear focus
[time=1592] from an eternal, watch this, from an eternal perspective, this is the truth, what I just said
[time=1599] there, that's the truth and it's the truth from an eternal perspective, we were saved from an
[time=1608] empty, worthless, useless life, but say you might, you might sit there and or someone
[time=1617] watching on the broadcast might be sitting there going well wait a minute now, my life's not worthless, my life's not empty, I mean to the contrary, my life is full
[time=1631] and I'm happy and I'm satisfied, but see the message of God's word from an eternal perspective
[time=1639] is that all of life outside of relationship with Christ, all of life prior to salvation and redemption
[time=1648] when viewed from an eternal perspective is empty, see it's the perspective and if you're going to
[time=1655] gauge, if you're going to define how full and how complete and how worthwhile your life is and if
[time=1665] you're going to gauge that by your bank account, if you're going to gauge that by the number of degrees that you've earned, if you're going to gauge that by education, if you're going to gauge how worthwhile your life is based upon vacation spots, number of cars in the garage,
[time=1681] square footage in your home, you can do that, that's just not an eternal perspective, that's a very
[time=1691] temporary immediate perspective and what God's word teaches us here in our passage and what we know
[time=1698] to be true is that there is a very big difference because all the degrees and all the square footage
[time=1704] and all the vacation spots and all the education and all the popularity and all the prestige and
[time=1710] all the memberships, someday, God, no more, doesn't get you anything, there's a day coming when all
[time=1724] that will matter is what you and I gave ourselves to eternally. Makes sense? And life outside of
[time=1733] Christ, life without relationship with Him, Peter says, folks, you've been redeemed from an empty,
[time=1741] sorry, useless life when it's all said and done. That's why Jesus said what He said in Matthew 16,
[time=1750] you can turn there if you'd like. Matthew 16, 26, an amazing couple of questions where Jesus just
[time=1756] kind of cuts right to it. He says, in Matthew 16, 26, for what will it profit? I mean, really,
[time=1763] He says, let's just get right down to it. What's it going to give you? What are you going to gain?
[time=1767] What will you profit? He says, what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world?
[time=1774] Let's go big. Let's just say you gained the whole world. It was all yours. He says, what's it going
[time=1780] to gain you if you get that but you lose your what? Your soul, eternal perspective right there.
[time=1789] And I love the second question. Or we'll say it this way. He says, what will a man give in exchange
[time=1795] for his soul? Now think about this with your, you got to just consider this honestly now with your soul, with your life on the line, with all of eternity up for grabs. What were you going to,
[time=1810] what were you going to give? What were you going to offer? What is it that you're going to go after
[time=1817] in exchange for that? What? A better business card with a more impressive title? What?
[time=1829] You're going to give up that for what? Square footage? You're going to get what?
[time=1832] Jesus spoke to this issue clearly and powerfully. He wanted his people to live with an eternal
[time=1840] perspective. And this is where many of us in this room, myself included. This is where we used to live.
[time=1846] This is how we used to think. This is how we used to function trapped in utter futility.
[time=1856] Paul says it pretty powerfully in Romans 6. You can go back to Romans 6. You see how the
[time=1863] apostle Paul says it as he writes to the church at Rome. He uses a phrase that we learned about
[time=1869] last week as we looked at Hosea and his great redeeming love for Gomer, his prostitute wife.
[time=1876] We see the same notion here. You'll know if you were here last week that Gomer, the wife of Hosea,
[time=1882] ends up being sold into slavery. We know that Hosea comes back and buys her out of this wretched,
[time=1893] debauched slavery that she had found herself in. He buys her back, takes her home, makes him, makes her his wife again. Paul reminds us that we were in the exact same position. You want to
[time=1906] know this morning what you were redeemed from, it says in Romans 6. You see it right there.
[time=1912] It says knowing this that our old self, talking about what takes place in redemption and salvation,
[time=1920] knowing this that our old self was crucified with him in order that our body of sin might be done
[time=1927] away with so that we would no longer be, say it loud, slaves to sin, slaves to sin. I'm going to
[time=1939] just stop there for a minute and I don't know what pictures come to your mind when you think about
[time=1945] slavery. I don't know what what scenes might play out in your head when you think about someone
[time=1955] being a slave. You may think about how they are treated. You may consider their utter lack of
[time=1962] freedom. You may consider the brutality and the hopelessness of their existence. You may think
[time=1970] about a beating. You may think about a whipping. You may, I don't know where your mind goes but I want you just to think for a moment about the picture of true slavery, of being in bondage,
[time=1982] of being owned and treated like it. And that, my friends, is where you and I were in relationship
[time=1994] to the evil one prior to redemption. It's what you got redeemed from.
[time=2000] If you go to Ephesians 4, Paul says it just as powerfully and just as descriptively in Ephesians 4,
[time=2010] 17, he says, "So this I say and affirm together with the Lord that you walk no longer live no longer
[time=2020] just as the Gentiles." Gentiles there would mean those that don't know God. Don't walk as the Gentiles
[time=2026] walk in the futility, in the emptiness of their mind, being darkened in their understanding,
[time=2033] watch the progression, watch the downward spiral here. This is how it goes. You know it and so do I.
[time=2038] The futility of their mind leading to being darkened in their understanding, leading to being
[time=2044] excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness
[time=2050] of their heart, leading to them becoming callous, leading to them giving themselves over to sensuality
[time=2060] for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
[time=2066] That's just the truth about life outside of relationship with him. That's where it goes.
[time=2081] We were slaves, shackled, chained in custody behind bars, say it however you want to say it,
[time=2089] sin ruled us. It beat us down, stripped us of our dignity, blinded our hearts and minds from the
[time=2097] truth. Ephesians 2 says that you and I were prior to redemption. Ephesians 2 says that we were dead
[time=2103] in our trespasses and sin. Sometimes I'll hear folks talk about how their sin has got them in a bind
[time=2113] or a quandary. I try to lovingly remind them, you know what my friend, it's a lot worse than a bind.
[time=2121] You're dead. You're toast. You're gone. Sin has its rule over you.
[time=2135] Some of you in the room this morning can vividly remember being utterly controlled by sin.
[time=2146] I'll never forget one of my first glimpses into the power of sin. I was about 10 years old
[time=2156] and I've told you oftentimes about one of my most favorite relatives. I've told you oftentimes
[time=2163] about my great love for my grandpa Joe and all that he invested in me and all that he taught me
[time=2169] and all that he said to me and all that he modeled for me especially later in his life.
[time=2173] I don't know if I've ever told you this though but grandpa Joe was for about 55 years
[time=2179] an alcoholic. It's my mom's dad and it was pretty severe. It was pretty ugly.
[time=2187] And I'll never forget being about 10 years old and there was just one of the many seasons in his life where he had made a decision to try and get sober. He was going to try and get cleaned up and he came to our home and my mom and dad graciously welcomed him in and they gave him our guest room
[time=2203] back in the back and he was a mess and I remember walking him down the hall and it smelled like
[time=2210] I had never smelled anything like that and they got him cleaned up and they laid him in bed.
[time=2215] And I don't know if you've ever seen it personally. I don't know if you've ever seen it in the movies.
[time=2220] I don't know maybe you've gone through it yourself but what then took place over the next 48 hours was like nothing I'd ever heard or seen or even been close to. As I listened to him lay in that
[time=2234] bed back in that room and just scream and shake and cry and yell. I remember going back to my room
[time=2244] and putting my head under my pillow and I could still hear the shaking that was going on as he
[time=2253] went into convulsions as he tried to dry himself out. That was amazing enough for me but what
[time=2262] absolutely boggled my mind was when I got home from school I remember two or three days into this.
[time=2269] I found my mom at the kitchen table with tears just running down her cheeks and she let me know
[time=2275] that he had left and that he hadn't left healthy that he had left to go and drink again.
[time=2283] And I couldn't articulate it then like I can now but if I could have articulated it then
[time=2289] I would have said my goodness I never knew something could have such a hold on us.
[time=2300] Sin is an amazing, the evil one. It's a powerful deal and I am so grateful. My grandpa Joe was so
[time=2310] grateful later in his life and I know many of you in this room are so grateful for the end of Romans
[time=2316] 6 and I'll just draw your attention back to the end of Romans 6 because though in verse 6 it said
[time=2323] we were slaves to sin. Look at what it says in 6 17. It says in Romans 6 17 but thanks be to God.
[time=2330] Anybody want to say amen? But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin you became
[time=2339] obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed, the scriptures and having been this is so good and having been freed from sin you became say it loud. You became slaves
[time=2352] of righteousness. Praise God. Yeah you became, he made you a slave again.
[time=2360] And I want you to think about that now just do the flip flop. Now in Christ now having been redeemed
[time=2368] he says you are a slave to that which is right and true and good. And I don't miss this because a lot
[time=2376] of you in the room just when I said that thought to yourself what I think to myself and you think gosh I don't feel like a slave to righteousness. I don't live like a slave to righteousness as much
[time=2387] as I wished I would. Well you know what the daily experience is the ongoing walk that's true but
[time=2393] don't miss this you listen you are. I wish I could just go to every single one of you right now
[time=2402] and I just want to put my hand on your shoulder and I want to just look you in the eye and I want to just tell you the truth because the truth is listen you are a slave to righteousness
[time=2412] if you know him. And we buy all kinds of lies and we go down all kinds of paths it's why I tell
[time=2421] my kids remember that's why I tell my kids this is you're a bird. Last name's bird if you're a
[time=2427] visitor we kind of talked about that a couple weeks ago. I confused a first time guest a couple
[time=2435] weeks ago. That's why I tell my kid on my kid on my kid's bird yes or no. Yes or no. Yeah they're
[time=2443] birds I tell them you're you're a bird this is what we do. You can't change that. Do they wake up
[time=2453] one day and say dad I don't feel like a bird no you're you're a bird. Hey folks friends listen you
[time=2461] are a slave because you gave yourself to him because he redeemed you you are a slave
[time=2468] to righteousness that's who you are and you and I have to begin to in our time with him and in our
[time=2476] times with each other and in our walk day by day we need to realize that that's who we are and we
[time=2483] can buy his grace and with his power live like that perfectly no but progressively more and more like
[time=2492] him yes slaves to righteousness slaves to sin remember it's what he saved you out of and I know
[time=2503] there's a lot of folks in the room this morning and you remember clearly the agony and the anguish
[time=2510] of sin and let me say this one last thing let me say this to you the anguish and the agony and the despair and the destruction and the darkness of sin and slavery
[time=2524] to sin my grandpa Joe all that he went through the addictions that you're aware of the struggles
[time=2530] that you've had the broken marriages the felonies the whatever remember this whether you were saved
[time=2539] whether you were redeemed out of that or whether you were saved at the age of nine
[time=2546] in a church pew as a regular attender it's all the same both are just as guilty
[time=2556] both are just as lost both are just as held captive
[time=2562] lost is lost outside of relationship with Christ is outside of relationship with Christ and it's
[time=2570] just as futile so if you're sitting here today going wow I wish I could be like really thankful
[time=2576] for my salvation because I just got saved when I was nine with my mom and dad and I never did anything against the law be really really really grateful because you were really really steeped
[time=2589] and lost in sin and he redeemed you out of it amen second question write it down
[time=2596] what are we redeemed with we know what we've been redeemed from the futility the emptiness
[time=2605] of life apart from him what did he use what did he use to pay the bill did he use a visa
[time=2613] did he use a master card did he use cash was it a coin was it silver was it gold we're paying for
[time=2620] stuff every day of our lives what what do we pay it what what currency are we using you know what I mean what did he pay it with I'll tell you what our passage our passage answers the question
[time=2632] knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold
[time=2639] from your futile way of life and inherited from your forefathers but you were redeemed what with precious what say it with precious blood what can wash away my sin nothing but the what
[time=2651] blood of Jesus but with precious blood as of a lamb unblemished and spotless the blood of
[time=2662] who say it Peter makes it very clear that our freedom from slavery came at a high high price
[time=2671] it was not with mere coins or money saved up our redemption our ransom had value
[time=2679] note what he calls it he calls it precious blood write that down underline it you know make a note
[time=2686] there precious blood I learned this week that whenever you see this word precious in the Greek
[time=2694] there's usually two very important things that are being communicated write this down number one it meant something very very costly the price was really really high this was an expensive
[time=2706] something whatever it's referring to precious this precious that well here we're talking about
[time=2712] precious blood this was a costly preciousness and then highly secondly wherever you see that
[time=2720] word precious know that whatever it's referring to was highly esteemed held in great honor my friends
[time=2726] this makes sense the blood of Christ shed was God's blood and therefore it is held in the highest
[time=2736] esteem and he says we are to know we are to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was an act of
[time=2744] God through his son's own death and blood by which our freedom was paid the blood of Christ the
[time=2752] sacrifice of Christ sometimes folks get hung up on this blood thing let's just clear that up right now okay the blood yes he bled and yes he died and the blood is very is very literal but there wasn't
[time=2764] anything magical about Jesus of Nazareth's blood real blood some folks think we're going to get
[time=2771] to heaven and have a big bowl of blood up there and he's going to wash everybody no the Bible doesn't say that his blood is was very real it is very symbolic of the most important element
[time=2781] in all of this which is his sacrificial death that's the truth here his sacrificial death the
[time=2789] sacrificial death of the spotless lamb God always said it would be that way the blood of the lamb is
[time=2795] what will redeem the blood of the lamb is what will forgive and now it's the real lamb of God the
[time=2801] son of Jesus Christ we were not redeemed with the use of a little silver or a little gold or a little
[time=2809] credit card we were redeemed by the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ we were set free
[time=2820] taken off the auction block chains removed by the sacrificial blood the cleansing blood the
[time=2828] atoning blood of the perfect lamb of God there couldn't have don't miss this there couldn't have
[time=2835] been a higher more costly price paid for your redemption did you hear that see here's the deal
[time=2845] see you let me say to you one more time there couldn't have been a higher price paid couldn't
[time=2855] have been think of the biggest number you can think of put a whole bunch of zeros on the end my
[time=2861] friends see here's the deal see your your worth in his eyes you're worth that much and there's a
[time=2869] lot of people in this room who don't think they're worth anything and you know what he gave up his
[time=2878] boy he gave up his son he allowed the ultimate sacrifice because you meant that much to him
[time=2884] and I want you to see this it's very important that you see this this there's very important that
[time=2891] you and I understand the lengths to which he went that the price that was paid for you and I to be
[time=2898] redeemed and to show you this I want to take you a second Corinthians 5 second Corinthians 5 21
[time=2905] write that down you can turn there if you'd like second Corinthians 5 21 this is something that we oftentimes just kind of read quickly important I think today for you to just stop and take note of the price that was paid the lengths to which he went for you and I to be redeemed watch this he God made him who knew no sin stop there I'm hoping everybody in the room I mean
[time=2928] somebody here may not be there yet that's fine just kind of keep going down this journey with us but there's a there's a whole lot here that's really really clear that Jesus Christ was sinless
[time=2940] this was this was the person of Christ 100% divine 100% God while being 100% man at the same time
[time=2950] and in his humanity though he was just like us in his divinity there was no sin he was the
[time=2957] spotless lamb I believe that he was without sin he was without blemish he didn't even have the
[time=2964] capacity to sin he was that perfect he faced it all he saw it all but he was holy he was perfect
[time=2975] and God made him who knew no sin to this is an amazing two words to what's it say say
[time=2983] to be think about that to be sin not he didn't just brush him up against it right
[time=2995] he didn't just kind of expose him to it no no no God made him who knew no sin to be cut to be
[time=3003] sin now it's important that we understand what this means he was in no way tainted with sin or guilt in his character he had no capacity for sin never had sinned and yet he is
[time=3017] the one who bears the sin who takes upon himself listen all the guilt all the pain all the sin
[time=3026] of all the people who have ever lived every sinful act ever committed ever thought ever carried out
[time=3035] all of it placed on him he becomes the bearer of sin my mind kind of just does a tilt right there
[time=3048] I don't know about yours I just kind of I kind of take a timeout right there and just go you know
[time=3054] what I can't I can't even begin to fathom I don't know if you ever saw the passion of the Christ
[time=3065] and I don't know what your experience was I'll tell you what when I watched it this is what struck
[time=3074] me as I said I just cried through the last hour and a half I think and I don't know if I was saying
[time=3081] it audibly I know I was saying it internally I just kept saying over and over and I can't believe
[time=3087] he's doing it was almost like I was there I was speaking in the present you know what I mean I can't believe he's doing this for me I can't believe he did all of that I can't believe he
[time=3098] endured all I can't believe he took all of that for me
[time=3105] costly no higher price could have ever been paid for your redemption he loved you that much he
[time=3116] redeemed you out of slavery he redeemed you out of empty futility he redeemed you with the precious
[time=3123] blood the precious life sacrifice of his son so that you could do what that's where our passage
[time=3131] takes us third question I want to ask you today what are we redeemed for and you see it right
[time=3137] there in verses 20 and 21 for he was foreknown before the foundation of the world but has appeared
[time=3145] in these last times for the sake of you who through him through Christ you and I are believers in God
[time=3153] God who raised him from the dead gave him glory so that the whole passage comes down to so that
[time=3160] you've been redeemed from sin you've been redeemed with the precious blood you've been redeemed a
[time=3166] price got paid you got given life so that you might what's it say so that your faith
[time=3173] write these down so that your faith and your different thing now and your hope
[time=3179] would be in him so that your faith and hope are in God
[time=3185] here's here's the important thing to note there faith watch this all that being said
[time=3196] leads you and I to this realization that he wants us as redeemed people to live with our faith in him faith has to do with you and I trusting him you and I believing in him you and I exercising
[time=3209] our faith in him today right now this afternoon tonight tomorrow when the temptation comes on the
[time=3215] computer tonight when the temptation comes with the difficult person at work tomorrow when the difficulty comes up with the family situation that could just as quickly lead you into sin whatever
[time=3226] is going to happen tonight tomorrow Tuesday or Thursday it is your faith that we exercise in the
[time=3232] everyday here and now and our faith in him having been redeemed our faith in him allows us to live
[time=3239] today tomorrow Thursday and Friday in obedience it is our faith that sustains us and it is our
[time=3247] faith that we're to move toward and then he also says he wants you and I to have hope while faith
[time=3253] has to do with the everyday decisions that you and I make he says hey don't all don't forget this
[time=3259] also live as redeemed people with hope hope has to do with an eternal promise you and I should be
[time=3267] living daily with a gratitude for a longing for and I can't wait for heaven glory the day and the
[time=3278] time and the place when all of this is done and you and I get to be with him you have been redeemed
[time=3284] so he says live like it live by faith in the everyday and live with hope as you look toward
[time=3290] the future and whatever you do watch this go back to verse 14 whatever you do here it is
[time=3298] the culmination of the whole thing whatever you do verse 14 chapter 1 verse 14 as obedient
[time=3306] children do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance
[time=3314] don't live like unredeemed people when you've been in fact redeemed
[time=3323] remember I told you about remember I told you about Glinda that I tell you about my friend
[time=3331] remember the gal who we were at the lake and I I swam out and got remember that story I saved Glinda
[time=3338] Houghton at Pyramid Lake above LA about 30 miles I saved Glinda Houghton's life
[time=3346] remember I told you about that a couple weeks ago and she's just you know she's been just forever
[time=3352] grateful 22 years later whenever we see each other I get a big squeeze and she almost kills me squeezes so tight and slaps me on the back and she's so thankful
[time=3365] you'd be just to make the point it would be as if for you and I to walk out of this place and be conformed to our former life to go back and begin to give ourselves to that kind of living
[time=3377] to live unredeemed to go back to slavery it would be as if Glinda it would be as if Glinda
[time=3387] having gotten I laid her on the shore she's coughing up all the stuff she's coughing up
[time=3394] the medical folks come from the lifeguard station they worked on her for about 20 minutes and she was good to go it would be as if Glinda were to just get up and just walk right back out into the lake
[time=3406] now you and I know that clear thinking sane people don't get up off the deck
[time=3418] walk back out in the lake and kill themselves so don't so don't
[time=3426] to hear me don't and if you need help ask live like you're redeemed remember this week
[time=3437] what you've been redeemed from remember this week what he used to redeem you with
[time=3443] you're worth that much and live by faith and live with hope and live like you're redeemed
[time=3450] amen amen amen would you stand and let's pray God we say amen and we say praise God and we say yes we will do that we will go and face this week
[time=3467] with a redeemed mindset God we will go and face this week with the truth about redemption
[time=3473] clearly focused in our minds and we also know that the moment we walk out of these doors
[time=3479] temptation will come and it will come quickly it will come swiftly and it will come from all
[time=3486] different sides God the pressures will begin to mount again the frustration will begin to build
[time=3493] the hopelessness might begin to seep in the questions will begin to be asked God the doubt might begin to make its way back and we just pray God that you would your holy spirit would
[time=3506] your word would and your people would all in concert God that we would open our hearts and lives
[time=3513] to all the above tonight and tomorrow early in the morning will rerise God early in the morning
[time=3519] will we come to you we will come to you each and every day as the week progresses giving ourselves
[time=3527] to you to your truth and to this life that you've called us to live where we need help God we'll
[time=3533] ask for it in humility and we'll listen to the answers that come God we will subject ourselves
[time=3540] to what is true and right and good God we will live with your help and by your grace as slaves
[time=3547] to righteousness this is our prayer and we pray God that you would strengthen us in that direction
[time=3553] in your son's name in his precious name we pray amen
[time=3577] you
