[time=60] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here
[time=73] at Black Hawk Ministries, and we wanna welcome you again to the Bible Hour.
[time=78] I am so grateful for the way in which so many of you on a regular basis, let us know, let me know how God is moving in your life.
[time=88] The things that he's showing, the things he's teaching you, you email me, we get your letters and we talk when we bump into each other out in the community.
[time=97] I wanna share with you today something that God is doing in me, something that he's teaching us here at Black Hawk as a staff and leadership, even as a family.
[time=108] God is growing our hearts for, God is deepening our desire to see not only Black Hawk Ministries prevail, but God's growing our heart for the church of Fort Wayne.
[time=122] He really is.
[time=123] He is developing and growing in us a real desire to see like-minded churches like Black Hawk do their very best with God's help, to reach this community with that life-changing eternity-altering message that you've heard us talk about and proclaim for years.
[time=143] And I'm learning more and more so that it's not about this place alone, it's not about us winning.
[time=149] It is about the church of Fort Wayne, places that aren't about religion, they're about a relationship with Christ.
[time=156] They believe strongly in the Word of God and they do their best to teach it and proclaim it and empower their people to live it out so that others can be reached, so that others can be encouraged, so that others can come to faith in Christ.
[time=173] And so we are gonna do our very best in the months and Lord willing years to come to take this tool that he's given us.
[time=181] We call it the Bible Hour.
[time=182] There are thousands and thousands of you who tune in each week and we realized that with the Bible Hour we had an opportunity to not only share with you our ministry but to share with you the ministries of others.
[time=195] And so there are a number of churches that we can't wait for you to meet in essence.
[time=200] And we're gonna do that right here.
[time=201] We're going to take some time every month or so and introduce you to a church that we really support.
[time=209] We believe in and we want you to get to know them better.
[time=213] And our hope is that you'll be encouraged.
[time=215] Many of you may live close to one of these places.
[time=218] It may be a chance for you to connect with them.
[time=221] You may not live close.
[time=222] It may just be a chance for you to be encouraged by what God is doing in the greater community here in Northeast Indiana.
[time=230] So today we begin a segment that we've entitled celebrating the church of Fort Wayne.
[time=235] And I have got a good friend and a guy that I respect greatly.
[time=239] Mr. Ron Williams, Pastor Ron Williams from Pathway Community Church.
[time=243] And Ron is gonna share with you all some things today about Pathway Community.
[time=249] And he's gonna tell you the story of this place and I can't wait for you to get to know him better.
[time=255] And Ron, why don't you just share with the folks?
[time=258] First of all, right out of the gate, why don't you share with the viewing audience kind of how Pathway began?
[time=264] Kind of its story, its inception.
[time=266] Tell them how that came to be.
[time=268] And then we'll hit some more as we go.
[time=270] Pathway Community Church started about six years ago in the hearts of four couples who were attending Avalon Missionary Church on the Southeast side of Fort Wayne.
[time=279] And their senior pastor at that time, Jeff Getz had made his way over to one of their homes for dinner one night.
[time=285] And as he was driving across town, he was wondering why they're driving clear across town to come to Avalon.
[time=289] Avalon's a great church.
[time=291] And through the course of dinner that evening, he just presented them with a question.
[time=295] The question was, when are you gonna consider planning a church on the Northwest side of Fort Wayne?
[time=299] And certainly for these four couples, they had not considered that.
[time=302] They were very happy in the church they were at Avalon.
[time=304] And yet God used that to begin to birth just a little seed of vision inside of their hearts for what could be.
[time=312] They began to look at their neighbors and realized that some of their closest friends were not attending church anywhere.
[time=317] They wondered, you know, where our friends actually drive from Northwest Fort Wayne, clear across Southeast to go to church.
[time=323] And so out of that time, they began to pray together for the next year.
[time=327] They began to seek really God's guidance and regards this church planning venture.
[time=332] And God just really set them up to plant this church.
[time=336] They were servants.
[time=338] They were folks that had a deep, passionate love for the Lord to influence their friends for the cause of Christ.
[time=344] And so out of that, our denomination, the missionary church joined arms with them and said, let's do it.
[time=349] You know, let's make this thing happen.
[time=352] And so towards the end of '01, my wife and I, we were on staff at Fellowship Missionary Church here for 12 years.
[time=359] And God began to work in our hearts about this church planning venture on the Northwest side.
[time=364] And we began to connect with these couples.
[time=368] And out of that connection, you know, we realized that our vision was the same and that our passion was the same.
[time=374] Are these couples you had known at all?
[time=377] - We had never met them before.
[time=378] - Wow, wow.
[time=379] - We didn't know who they were.
[time=381] And what was ironic is that initially when even the idea was proposed to us about being part of a church plant northwest side of Fort Wayne, we said no to it.
[time=390] We said no.
[time=391] And yet God would not let that go in our hearts either.
[time=394] And so towards the end of '01, a fellowship jumped on board with this plant venture, not only did fellowship jump on board, but certainly several missionary churches in Fort Wayne became engaged in the project.
[time=407] Woodburn and Grable and Aboyt and certainly Fellowship and Avalon.
[time=413] And from that, families were basically tied to the church planning venture.
[time=419] And by the end of '01, we had about 90 folks, including kids, that were all meeting together to move out and plant this church in Northwest Fort Wayne.
[time=432] - So we started in January of '02 and from there, God has just done an incredible thing with a little dream that was birth in the hearts of four couples.
[time=442] - Ron, you mentioned that in the hearts of those four couples, there was this real strong desire to see their friends, unchurched friends reached.
[time=454] They had a strong desire to be a part of a church that would be the kind of church that their unchurched friends could come to and hear that life-changing message.
[time=465] Our viewing audience often hears me talk about our mission here at Black Haut.
[time=470] They hear me say it all the time.
[time=472] We're trying to help seeking people, find and follow Christ.
[time=476] That's what we're about.
[time=477] Everything we do kind of runs through that grid.
[time=480] I know the mission at Pathway.
[time=483] I know that principle and that picture that gets you guys up every morning to do what you do.
[time=489] I know it's similar, but share it with our audience.
[time=493] Tell the folks what it is that's driving ministry.
[time=496] Tell the folks what it is that you guys are trying to do there with God's help at Pathway.
[time=501] How do you say that?
[time=503] - You know, reaching people for Christ is really, it's been the heart of Pathway since from the very beginning.
[time=508] And I think that's one thing that has really helped to facilitate the growth of Pathway in that Pathway wasn't planted because a group of people were disgruntled about their home churches.
[time=519] Pathway was planted out of a call and out of a deep desire to reach their friends and their neighbors for Christ.
[time=524] And so our mission is a lot the same, just like yours, Kelly, in that we exist to intentionally influence people, to seek a genuine and growing relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=537] And so everything we do is about intentionally influencing friends for the cause of Christ, to bring them into an understanding of who Christ is and what Christ came to do and how Christ provides them with a new sense of fulfillment and redemption that no one else can.
[time=553] - You mentioned early on that you didn't initially
[time=559] have a building and I know you still are moving in that direction with some exciting things going on as far as expansion for you guys.
[time=568] But tell the folks who are watching, tell them about where you meet today.
[time=571] I'm gonna have Ed throw the service times and the website up underneath our picture here.
[time=577] And I would encourage you who are viewing to kind of check that out.
[time=581] Tell the folks where you meet today so they'll know where to find you guys.
[time=585] - We meet at the Carroll Ninth Grade Academy, formerly Carroll Middle School.
[time=590] Now it's a join to the Carroll High School on Carroll Road.
[time=594] And that's where we pull our trucks in and unload everything and convert a school into a church.
[time=600] And we've had just a tremendous relationship with the school system out there.
[time=604] - So you put the whole thing together starting at what time on Sunday morning?
[time=607] - We're going at 5.30 AM.
[time=609] - Wow.
[time=611] - Wow. And then you're done by when?
[time=612] - We roll out at one o'clock.
[time=614] - So between 5.30 and one, a church gets established and torn down and it's back to a school, that's cool.
[time=621] Well listen, I know that there are many things that you are excited about.
[time=626] When you think about what God is doing at Pathway, there are a lot of things that I'm excited about when I see what God is doing there with you and that team.
[time=635] - So share with the folks maybe one thing, Ron.
[time=638] One thing that is you look at what God is doing in the midst of that growing family.
[time=642] One thing that maybe encourages you the most today.
[time=645] Tell them about that.
[time=647] - You know, we're certainly in the midst of our building program right now and getting a building up there on Carroll Road, but the building is really secondary to what God is really doing at Pathway and what we're about at Pathway.
[time=658] And that is seeing just the drove of people that is coming in and seeing their lives changed because the power of Jesus Christ.
[time=667] And as they come to an understanding of what it means to be in relationship with Christ, we're seeing marriages restored, we're seeing family strengthened, we're seeing people experience a sense of wholeness from the brokenness that they've experienced up to that point.
[time=683] And so we're just grateful for God allowing us to be a part of redeeming people.
[time=690] And we get to play a small role in that journey.
[time=693] - Well, that's to hear Ron share that, you know, is as exciting to me as I think it is to him.
[time=702] And those of you who tune in here each and every week, you know how very thankful we are for changed lives.
[time=710] I've told you before, it's what excites me more than anything.
[time=714] And we just wanna make sure that you're aware of the fact.
[time=718] We wanna make sure that you're cognizant of and realizing that there are lives being changed eternally all over this city.
[time=728] And it's places like pathway and people like Ron and the staff that God has brought around him that are leading that charge.
[time=734] And we're so thankful for them.
[time=736] And so very thankful that we can take time like this and share with you their story, share with you their ministry.
[time=744] And again, maybe you need to go and check it out if it's something that is nearby or something that you feel God knitting your heart to.
[time=751] If nothing else, please join us in praying for them on a regular basis.
[time=756] We're so thankful to be a part of the church of Fort Wayne and so very thankful to be able to share this with you today.
[time=763] Thank you so very much for tuning in.
[time=766] God bless and have a great week.
[time=768] (gentle music)
[time=776] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=865] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 335 seconds]
[time=1206] Well, let me ask you a question.
[time=1217] Can I do that?
[time=1218] What if I told you there was a love that you could experience?
[time=1225] What if I told you there was a love you could possess, a love you could give?
[time=1230] What if I told you there was a love that you could offer others that would never, ever fail?
[time=1238] It would be a perfect love that would entail and possess, in and of itself, everything needed to provide a complete and powerful offering of love.
[time=1251] Would you take it?
[time=1253] Would you want it?
[time=1254] This love that would never fail.
[time=1257] Would that be of interest to you?
[time=1260] I bet most of you probably would be interested.
[time=1264] And as you think about that this morning, and I want to invite you now to begin to think about this love that would never fail, this perfect, all-powerful love that would just do all that it was supposed to do.
[time=1275] As you think about that, I want to clarify something that's very important for our discussion.
[time=1280] You see, Steve and I are wanting to discuss with you this morning this love that never fails.
[time=1286] And I've already got you thinking about it a little bit, I know.
[time=1289] How sweet this would be, how good this might work out.
[time=1293] What an amazing picture this could turn out to be.
[time=1296] But I need to remind you of something.
[time=1298] I need to remind you that so far I've only used terms and phrases like possessing this kind of love, giving this kind of love, offering this kind of love,
[time=1311] extending this kind of love.
[time=1314] These are the phrases and words we've used so far.
[time=1318] Noticeably absent from the brief discussion we've had so far in these first three minutes is any reference to getting this kind of love.
[time=1330] And there's a reason for that.
[time=1333] You see, this love that never fails is a love that finds its power.
[time=1337] It is a love that finds its strength in the giving of it, in the offering of it, not in the getting of it.
[time=1347] And that can be very confusing for some of us in the room today because we've grown up in a culture and we have grown up with a mindset that defines love as being about me receiving and me feeling and me getting, the getting and the feeling and the receiving.
[time=1367] It just comes up all the time.
[time=1372] I can't tell you the last time a couple walked into my office in the midst of absolute marital disaster and said, "Hey, you know what? We really need some help.
[time=1380] We need to talk about how we need to be giving more love." It is again and again and again in their lives and mind.
[time=1391] In our sinfulness and in our skewed perspective of love, it becomes again and again and again about what he's not doing, what she's not saying, what I'm not getting.
[time=1403] And now you're sitting there thinking, you know what?
[time=1411] Come on now, if you're going to talk about a love that never fails, there must be some room in the discussion for what's going to come my way.
[time=1417] But you know what? Today, this morning, we're not going to go there.
[time=1420] Because any teaching about real love, any teaching about powerful, effective, penetrating love, any teaching on biblical love must focus on and deal directly with, initially, our calling to love,
[time=1438] our calling by God to offer it and to extend it, not our preoccupation with getting it, or how much of it we're receiving, or how well it's being offered toward us.
[time=1450] And so if you're interested in learning today about the kind of love you can have, the kind of love you can offer, the kind of love you can give to each other than our passage this morning in our ongoing study of 1 Peter, we believe will bring great insight and encouragement.
[time=1468] Now, the first thing that we want you to see is that this love that never fails
[time=1474] isn't, is not available.
[time=1481] It is not attainable.
[time=1483] It is not accessible to just anybody.
[time=1487] You see, this love that never fails, this all-powerful, all-encompassing, penetrating love is only available to those who have experienced something.
[time=1499] Very, very, very important.
[time=1503] There is something that must be in place before any of us can ever access this kind of love.
[time=1511] And so let me ask you today if you would join Steve and I.
[time=1515] I am so thankful Steve is here.
[time=1517] Steve Longbrake, one of our teaching pastors.
[time=1519] And he oversees our men's ministry and is vitally involved in marketplace ministry
[time=1525] here in Fort Wayne, Black Hawk supports Steve and an organization in ministry called Race to Win.
[time=1531] And I love him for all of that.
[time=1534] And I love him because he's just a dear, dear friend.
[time=1536] And we're thankful to get to be here together this morning with you as we come to the end of chapter 1 in our study.
[time=1543] Would you stand in honor of God's Word and allow me, if I could, to read for you our passage this morning?
[time=1550] A love that never fails.
[time=1552] 1 Peter 1 verses 22 to 25.
[time=1557] It says, "Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls
[time=1563] for a sincere love of the brethren fervently love one another from the heart.
[time=1569] For you have been born again, not of seed which is perishable but imperishable.
[time=1575] That is, through the living and enduring Word of God, for all flesh is like grass
[time=1581] and all its glory like the flower of grass.
[time=1584] The grass withers and the flower falls off, but the Word of the Lord endures forever.
[time=1590] And this is the Word which was preached to you." We've got four questions that we're going to look at and answer this morning.
[time=1599] Four very important questions that you've got to ask and you've got to allow God's Word to answer
[time=1605] is you better understand this amazing love that never fails.
[time=1609] Steve's going to pray for us and then he's going to take us to the first question.
[time=1615] Our Father in Heaven, your words always ring true because they are truth.
[time=1622] And when we don't like them, it's because in our own flesh we don't want to hear the truth.
[time=1631] But by your power, by your might, not ours, by your spirit,
[time=1637] we are able to understand what your Word says and then live it out.
[time=1642] And I pray that your spirit would rain down here.
[time=1647] That we would be people who would receive the truth and bring you the glory and the praise and the honor that you deserve because you first loved us and you love us now and we're grateful.
[time=1659] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=1663] When can we love? That's a good question.
[time=1667] Number one, when am I empowered to love?
[time=1673] When am I able to do that?
[time=1675] The world says that I can love you by feeling something for you.
[time=1684] It says I can love you by doing something for you.
[time=1688] And that might be an expression of love and it might not be.
[time=1694] The world says that me getting from you what makes me feel better is an act of love.
[time=1703] Now they never say it that way.
[time=1706] We don't say it that way to ourselves.
[time=1708] You know, we deceive ourselves, James says, into thinking that our human actions,
[time=1714] when we act out something that we call love, is about giving.
[time=1719] But the truth of it is in our flesh. The truth is, when we give, it's to get something back in response.
[time=1727] And we mask that in all kinds of ways.
[time=1729] So when can you really love?
[time=1733] 1 Peter 1.22 says, "Since you have an obedience to the truth, purified your souls."
[time=1742] He speaks to those people, many of them had come to Christ at Pentecost and then they were scattered all over the place.
[time=1749] And when Peter opens his book up, he says to those of you scattered.
[time=1753] They're all over the place.
[time=1755] And he says, "You have an obedience, obedience, attentive harkening." That's what that is.
[time=1762] It's utter compliance.
[time=1765] It's me choosing to submit, fully submit.
[time=1769] It's for illustration's sake only, you know, I know you're not going to do this, but for illustration's sake, it's like the speed limit where you go 50 to 55 instead of 55 to 60 when it's 55.
[time=1780] You go 60 to 65 instead of 65 to 70.
[time=1787] The reason I know that reigns so well is, you know, I live there.
[time=1791] Full compliance, full obedience, attentive harkening.
[time=1794] It means I harken, I understand it, and I pay attention to it, and I live it out.
[time=1800] Since you have an obedience to the truth, he says, the truth,
[time=1807] the reality lying at the base or the basis of what appears to be true, the reality,
[time=1814] it's the manifested, veritable essence of a matter.
[time=1818] It's what's really at the core of things.
[time=1820] That's what the truth is.
[time=1822] Since you have been obedient, since you have an obedience to the truth,
[time=1830] to what's in essence true, well, we know that as we look through the Bible.
[time=1834] What in essence is true, Jesus is the essence of God.
[time=1840] He's the image of the invisible God, the first born overall creation.
[time=1843] For by him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth visible in invisible.
[time=1847] He's the image of the invisible, he's the essence of God.
[time=1851] That gospel that came to us through him is the truth.
[time=1857] He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
[time=1863] So, in obedience to the truth, the essence of a matter, the whole of it.
[time=1872] I tell the truth most of the time, sometimes I tell truths and I feel okay.
[time=1881] My kids have been doing that to me a long time and I spot it because I do it.
[time=1887] If I'm trying to watch what I eat and Nancy says, "What did you have to eat at the airport yesterday?" which I thought about this one yesterday as I ordered.
[time=1896] I got the grilled chicken salad.
[time=1900] So, if she asks, I can say, "I got the grilled chicken salad." Nicely done.
[time=1905] It's one of the truths of the day.
[time=1909] But if she said, "What else did you have?" "What else did you have?" "Sometimes I hate it when she does that." She said, "What else did you have?" "I have to say, and I had the chicken strips and the fries." It's a big chicken day.
[time=1923] Yeah, I just went with the chicken.
[time=1926] Oh, but you know what? The whole truth. He is the whole of it.
[time=1932] And if an obedience, I've responded to that truth, morally cleansed by it.
[time=1938] That's what purified means.
[time=1940] And James 4 talks about the heart being purified.
[time=1943] And 1 Peter here talks about the soul.
[time=1945] In 1 John 3, it talks about one's whole self being purified.
[time=1949] Through the blood.
[time=1950] Now, this is not the time.
[time=1951] It's not a ceremonial cleansing here.
[time=1954] Okay?
[time=1956] This purification is through the blood of Christ.
[time=1961] It's not the sprinkling of blood around things that was God telling us about the blood.
[time=1968] This is the blood.
[time=1971] So what gets purified?
[time=1974] Your soul.
[time=1976] Look at that.
[time=1977] Since you have been in obedience to the truth, purified your souls.
[time=1981] Your soul. That is a really good definition of your soul would be the breath of life in you.
[time=1992] When God breathed the breath of life into Adam and Eve, He didn't just breathe air into them so they could have oxygen to keep their physical system going.
[time=2003] He breathed the breath of life into them.
[time=2006] That's what their soul is.
[time=2008] And since you have in obedience to the truth, purified your souls, you've received the breath of life your soul then is given new life through Christ.
[time=2023] If that's true about you, if you're one of those people who have responded to the gospel of Jesus Christ
[time=2029] and He has breathed new life into you, you can love.
[time=2035] That's how. He is love and you can only express real love as He does that through you.
[time=2044] Everything else is some kind of a little facsimile of it that the world defines or I define
[time=2050] if it's not from Him through me.
[time=2060] He says, and hope does not. In Romans 5, 5 you can write that down. It says, and hope just thought of it as He was talking, and hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts
[time=2072] through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[time=2076] Do you hear that? That's how that works right there.
[time=2079] Because the love you can love and you can only love.
[time=2083] You and I are only capable of real, powerful, penetrating love when we have experienced this verse in 1 Peter 1, 22,
[time=2091] what Steve just took us through there. Bottom line is we only get to love when we're saved, when we're redeemed.
[time=2100] Shy of being saved, you can be nice and you can offer some decent stuff,
[time=2107] but as far as the full potential of love and as far as its fullest expression
[time=2114] and all that God intended it to be, no, the love of God says because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts
[time=2120] when we come to know Him through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[time=2126] It's very important that at the beginning of this discussion today that we all understand that.
[time=2132] This kind of love, real love, only able to be really given, only able to be truly offered out of a heart that has been redeemed.
[time=2143] Yes.
[time=2146] And that's not a ha ha ha, you know, for those of you that haven't been.
[time=2153] It's a, it's a hey, we want you to hear that because we want you to have in your life love and its fullest expression.
[time=2165] I don't want you walking, we don't want you walking around in life exercising some cheap imitation.
[time=2172] We want you to be able to love, but you can't unless you really, really know Him.
[time=2180] So number one, when, when you come to know Christ, number two, write this down, who do we love?
[time=2189] Who do we love?
[time=2190] Go back to our passage, 1 Peter 1, 22, who are we to love?
[time=2194] It says there, since you have an obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren.
[time=2203] Stop right there.
[time=2205] For a sincere love of the brethren.
[time=2209] 1 John, right down 1 John 3.
[time=2213] 1 John 3, 14 through 16.
[time=2217] It says in 1 John 3, 14 through 16, we know that we have passed out of death into life.
[time=2226] Sounds like salvation to me.
[time=2228] Because we love the brethren.
[time=2231] He who does not love abides in death.
[time=2235] Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
[time=2242] We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the who, for the brethren.
[time=2255] It's really clear in our passage today, you could sit there and say, "Wait a minute, Kelly, I thought we were supposed to love everybody."
[time=2261] Well, you know what you are. In the greater scope of revealed truth, yes, you and I are to be a people willing and ready to love and extend love to anybody that God might bring across our path.
[time=2273] In the specific purpose, though, and intent of our passage here, this great truth is that as redeemed,
[time=2280] one of the first and foremost targets of our love and affection is to be the body of Christ.
[time=2287] You are to love me, and I am to love you, and we are to love each other with a sincere love.
[time=2297] You to me, me to you, you to you, you to him, him to harm me.
[time=2301] There is to be within this body of Christ, within this family of believers.
[time=2305] There is to be a deep personal and sincere love that we express one to another.
[time=2313] If you read through the New Testament, if you begin to get just even a small picture of what's communicated there for us,
[time=2321] and these pages of Scripture, you begin to realize there are some, there actually are many what we call one another's.
[time=2329] God has called us to a kind of love for each other that expresses itself in a number of different ways.
[time=2336] A study of the Scripture would help you and I to see that we are to love each other, we are to bear each other's burdens,
[time=2344] we are to mourn with each other, we are to rejoice with each other, we are to confess our sins to each other,
[time=2351] we are to pray for each other, we are to serve each other, we are to confront when necessary each other,
[time=2357] we are to fellowship with each other, there is this picture painted in the Word of God of body life, of relationship
[time=2368] within the family of God that is deep and personal and ongoing and supportive and helpful.
[time=2376] And I want to remind you, Stephen, I want to remind you this morning that this call to love the brethren,
[time=2383] this call to be deeply devoted to each other, you and I in our willingness or in our readiness to respond to that,
[time=2392] see we can't do, we want you to hear this clearly today, we can't do that at a distance.
[time=2400] And this is a culture and we live in a time, even in the church where as we continue to see all that we see and be impacted,
[time=2410] I almost said infected, but maybe that's the same thing, you see, the more and more culture gets inside the church,
[time=2418] the more and more culture penetrates your mind and my mind and our hearts, the more distant we get from each other
[time=2426] because see, it's all about me, it's about my agenda, it's about what I want, it's about what I need,
[time=2432] and God's Word says, whoa, wait a minute, we are to be intimately and personally devoted to each other.
[time=2440] Go to Ecclesiastes, would you, go back to the, go back to your Old Testament, you can go past Psalms and Proverbs
[time=2447] and then you'll come to Ecclesiastes, I want you to go to Ecclesiastes chapter 4.
[time=2454] We talk about this a lot around here, this is something that as a staff and leadership, we value highly,
[time=2460] this idea of community, this idea of relationship, this idea, this truth, this biblical principle of sharing and living life together
[time=2469] and the strength that comes with that will oftentimes come to this passage here in Ecclesiastes 4, where Solomon writes this,
[time=2476] look at verse 9, it says in verse 9 of Ecclesiastes 4, it says two, everybody hold up two, right there, everybody hold up two,
[time=2484] two are better than one, hold up one, two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.
[time=2495] Think about that, two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor, for if either of them falls,
[time=2504] the one will lift up his companion, but whoa, here you go, here's the danger of life in isolation, here's the danger of life alone,
[time=2514] here's the danger of life without community, but whoa to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up.
[time=2528] You need to think about that. There is great, listen, there is great strength, great strength
[time=2540] when you and I are willing to live life together.
[time=2545] And if one can look at verse 12, and if one can Ecclesiastes 4, 12, and if one can overpower him who is alone, stop there,
[time=2553] and if one can overpower him who is alone, who would we say the one is there?
[time=2560] Who, Satan, the enemy, the enemy who wants desperately, remember, don't lose sight of the fact,
[time=2567] he wants desperately to have you A alone and he wants desperately to be just clean your clock.
[time=2577] He wants to take you out, he wants to ruin your life, he wants to dismantle everything you hold to be true and dear.
[time=2586] And that one, that enemy, and all that he brings says there in verse 12, what's it say?
[time=2593] It says if one can overpower him who is alone, it's you and I standing by ourselves, unattached, not connected,
[time=2603] not in relationship, nothing real personal going, just me over here on my island facing life hoping I can withstand the onslaught.
[time=2614] And this right here, me by myself, doesn't even compare to the strength of, right there, right?
[time=2625] Here's a picture for you, right here, this right here.
[time=2629] Hey, how do I look, how do I look from there? You look good down there.
[time=2633] You see this right here? This is like, you know what, and stand right there.
[time=2637] I can just, there's a strength right here, me and him, praying together, reading God's word together,
[time=2644] talking to each other, emailing each other, asking questions of each other, spending time together,
[time=2652] saying things that need to be said, asking hard questions, forgiving when forgiveness is needed.
[time=2658] But being together, here come the fiery darts, here come the temptations, here come the thing, you know,
[time=2665] it's like, no, oh, you right there, oh, stay back.
[time=2668] I got along right here, you can't get, ah, you know, am I wider than he is, I hate that.
[time=2675] You know, there's this strength here, you understand what I'm saying?
[time=2681] You leave that, and you go out here, who's got your back?
[time=2688] Who's holding you up? Who's praying for you? Who's talking to you? Who's coming alongside?
[time=2694] But see what I love about this passage, which is so cool, is that it doesn't stop there.
[time=2699] If one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him, right? Two can, two can do a pretty decent job,
[time=2706] but you know what, sometimes the attack gets really, really steep.
[time=2713] And I think, I don't think, I know the author of Ecclesiastes knew a little bit about that,
[time=2719] and look where God leads him here. Two can resist him, a court of three, a court of three strands,
[time=2727] is not quickly torn apart. Okay, just a visual for you, Corbin, come here real quick, come up there.
[time=2733] I mean, if you thought that this, we're talking about the value of community, we're talking about the value of relationship.
[time=2741] Just stand there next to Stephen, there's lock arms, here lock arms, right there, right there.
[time=2745] Look at that, all right, now, you just imagine, if you will, imagine that Corbin would be,
[time=2752] imagine that I would be tempted, we can't imagine Corbin would be tempted.
[time=2756] He's too young. Imagine, well, no, we'll go back to Corbin, imagine if Corbin was tempted.
[time=2762] Imagine like Corbin and I and Steve, we're in this relationship together, and we really love each other, and we talk frequently, and we study God's word together, and we memorize it together, and we know what's going on in our lives, we really do talk about the everyday of life,
[time=2778] and we meet once, maybe twice, I mean, we're just really devoted to each other, and we're tight, and Corbin gets tempted, and he starts to go toward the temptation,
[time=2789] start walking toward the temptation, pull 'em, get back, go over, see that?
[time=2793] See that, do it again, do it again, see the enemy comes again, start going toward your temptation, Junior, go pull 'em that, boom, you see that?
[time=2801] I want you to see that, thank you, I want you to see that, I'm glad we saved you, I'm glad.
[time=2810] He's not, he can't get there, did you see that?
[time=2816] It's when you and I are willing to say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're not going there, but who's gonna say no, no, no, no, no, no, you're not going there, if there's nobody there?
[time=2827] And I'm so thankful that if you want that today, if you need that in your life,
[time=2834] if you're a couple who needs a home group of people who meets on a weekly basis to pray together
[time=2840] and study God's word together and grow relationship together and hold each other accountable and guard each other and help guide each other, you just have to ask and we'll get you connected.
[time=2851] If you want to be in a home group, you ask and we'll get you in one.
[time=2855] You're a man here, I'm one of the men in the audience, and you want a small group of guys, we've got 'em.
[time=2860] You come talk to us, we'll get you in a small group of guys where arms can be joined, hearts can be guarded.
[time=2866] Woman, women here in the room, if you want a small group of gals where you could be loved on and cared for,
[time=2872] prayed with and encouraged, just ask and we'll help get you connected.
[time=2879] And we will join arms and we will join hearts and we will do our very best to pull each other back and hold each other up.
[time=2886] Amen? Yes. Who are we to love each other?
[time=2892] Now you know what, sometimes that's hard. Sometimes that's challenging.
[time=2897] And I'm going to let Steve take us to the next point and we'll kind of get to that.
[time=2901] But understand we can only love when we know him, that's it.
[time=2906] And who we are to love, we are to love each other deeply, sincerely.
[time=2912] But he doesn't stop there. He goes on and describes this love even further.
[time=2917] Check this out. Steve, I'll give you number three. Write this down.
[time=2920] How do we love? How?
[time=2923] Well, if we're believers and we're trying to love other believers, how do we do it?
[time=2929] He says that we're going to love each other fervently. I like that word.
[time=2934] It's a great word, fervently, and intently. You're very intentional about this kind of love.
[time=2944] It's strenuous. You're going to engage in this kind of love knowing that it takes strength to love this way.
[time=2953] That's what fervently means. I looked it up several times in the New Testament, Jesus.
[time=2958] That word was used to describe how he was feeling at the time or what he was doing at the time.
[time=2963] And let's look at one of those. In Mark, chapter 8, verse 11 and 12, it says,
[time=2970] "The Pharisees came out and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him."
[time=2977] "Sying fervently," same word, deeply, in his spirit.
[time=2983] He said, "Why does this generation seek for a sign?
[time=2987] Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation." When the disciples aren't getting it, he has this fervent sigh that takes place.
[time=2998] When they're sleeping instead of praying, that's the anguish that comes over him.
[time=3004] And think about that in a positive way. You know that kind of deep feeling that you have sometimes
[time=3010] when you love somebody so much. I can remember the times when our kids would make choices that we were allowing them to make
[time=3019] because it was time for them to make them, but you knew the pain was coming.
[time=3026] After those choices are made, it might be, for some of you, maybe you've had children that were engaged
[time=3032] in a relationship that you thought was headed down a really serious path and it wasn't good for them.
[time=3038] So you may have experienced this kind of fervent sigh.
[time=3047] It's not anger. It's not frustration. It's that you care so deeply, that you want desperately to help.
[time=3060] That kind of desperation is what you ought to be feeling when you think about loving the brethren.
[time=3067] You're looking for the opportunity to fervently love one another. It's the agape love.
[time=3073] This one is agape. It comes from him through you. No other source for it.
[time=3081] Fervently love.
[time=3084] To fervently love, you have to be in training learning about what love is and being in shape to do it.
[time=3093] To be strenuously exercising your faith and acting out love, you have to be equipped and trained to do it.
[time=3101] You have to be in that process all the time.
[time=3103] When I want to do something and perform a 10k, I train for a long period of time in preparation for that.
[time=3110] I'm very serious about that. I fervently train for that.
[time=3113] When I wanted to run a 40-minute 10k at age 40, the previous two or three years, I worked really hard at that.
[time=3120] I trained strenuously.
[time=3123] If you want to love the brethren, the way they need all those things he listed on there, being hospitable, confronting, serving, mourning with. If you want to do that, we have to be fervent about our love for them.
[time=3134] And we have to train.
[time=3136] You train by renewing your mind with the truths that are in this word because you'll naturally exercise something that you call love that isn't.
[time=3148] If you don't do it, having fed on this, it'll be about you getting feelings back instead of you giving.
[time=3157] And then he says agape, that's God's will to us concerning our attitude toward one another, agape one another.
[time=3167] How? From the heart. I love this so much.
[time=3171] Your heart, the center of who you are in the New Testament, when that word's used, it often is referring to both your moral side,
[time=3179] your emotional side attached to that, and your mental thought life, the plans that you have.
[time=3185] The center of who you are in thought and in emotion, both wrapped up together.
[time=3191] That's good.
[time=3192] What needs to be in training? All of us.
[time=3196] We're eating our cardio, our muscle training, our mind when we're getting in shape to do something physical or mental.
[time=3202] To love, you've got to be in training.
[time=3205] You have to thoroughly equip your mind with his words or you'll do it your way and it'll be wrong from the heart.
[time=3212] Your entire entire mental and moral activity. Listen to this.
[time=3217] How strenuously express God's will in our attitude toward one another in all of our mental and emotional moral activity.
[time=3231] Now that's love right there, and you only get it from him.
[time=3234] We want to ask you to do something this week.
[time=3236] Would you be willing? I hope you would be.
[time=3238] We don't want you to just listen to this today. We want you to take this truth home with you and actually apply it.
[time=3244] Actually be what James calls doers of the word and not just listeners or hearers, okay?
[time=3251] We'd like you to think about two people right now.
[time=3254] You can write their names down or you can just store in your mind.
[time=3257] We'd like you to be willing this week to think of two individuals and your sphere of relationship that would be for you a natural individual
[time=3267] or two. It would be a natural connection where you could go and love them fervently with a tenacity, with a deep sense of radical.
[time=3279] Not going to be deterred, not going to be turned away.
[time=3282] I am going to love you fervently.
[time=3286] When you think of two people in your world where that would be a natural opportunity for you to go and as you think about it right now
[time=3292] you're thinking, "You know what? I'd like to do that." And then we'd like you to think of maybe one person, one person that it wouldn't be so natural or easy to do that with.
[time=3304] Who would be in your world, one individual who you could this week because you are redeemed because you know him and the love of God resides in you
[time=3314] and because you've been called to love the brethren and not only just love them but love them fervently and tenaciously and with great dedication and effort.
[time=3324] Who would be one that you could maybe offer that to that would be difficult for you to offer that to?
[time=3330] They might be hard to love. There may be some challenges there.
[time=3334] We'd love it if this week we left this place willing to be the people that God's called you to be as it relates to our willingness to love.
[time=3343] And don't forget this. Don't forget who Peter is writing to.
[time=3347] He's writing to people who were in the midst of being absolutely slaughtered.
[time=3353] These folks were getting persecuted. These folks were being beaten. These folks were losing family members.
[time=3360] See in the midst of difficulty and trial we oftentimes get inward.
[time=3365] God says wait a minute. Don't forget in the midst of great persecution I'm calling you to love and to love fervently.
[time=3373] So think that through no matter what you're going through who are two individuals that you could go love fervently and really enjoy that.
[time=3380] Pick one other one who you might be challenged by but you've got it with his help and his support and his strength.
[time=3388] He's going to allow you to go and do that.
[time=3391] Last question, would you stand as we close? Number four, why?
[time=3395] Why? Why should we okay?
[time=3399] We've talked about love. We've talked about this call to love the brethren. We've talked about this willingness to go and love fervently even.
[time=3407] But let's just ask the last question. Why?
[time=3410] Since you have an obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren fervently love one another.
[time=3417] Why? Verse 23, here you go, for you have been what?
[time=3424] For you have been what? Say it again.
[time=3426] Born again.
[time=3427] You know what my friends? It's what Christians do.
[time=3433] See we can't lose sight of that. It's what Christ followers do.
[time=3438] It's who we are.
[time=3441] If you know him, if you're fully surrendered to him, it's who you love this way.
[time=3448] You give yourself to this kind of endeavor, 1 John 4, 7 and 8. Let me read it to you.
[time=3453] Beloved, let us love one another.
[time=3456] For love is from God and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.
[time=3462] Verse 8, "The one who does not love does not know God for God is love."
[time=3475] If you know him, if you've fully surrendered your heart and life to him, then the spirit of God resides in you and calls you and I to a radical, deep, fervent love for each other.
[time=3488] And it is one of the most powerful things that an on-looking world sees when you and I are willing to love that deeply.
[time=3497] God, give us the strength and the courage and the boldness of heart.
[time=3502] You and I to love each other that way. Amen?
[time=3505] Yes.
[time=3506] God, we pause before you this morning.
[time=3508] We humbly come before you asking for your help.
[time=3511] Your divine intervention to help us restore relationships. God, to help us move through fear and uncertainty.
[time=3518] God, to allow us by your hand and by your might and with your strength to love each other well.
[time=3526] God, move us toward those people this week that we could love fervently and sincerely.
[time=3532] And we'll thank you for it in your son's name. We pray. Amen.
[time=3535] [AMEN]
