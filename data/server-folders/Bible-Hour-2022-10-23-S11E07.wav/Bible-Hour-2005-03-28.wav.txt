[time=330] It was an amazing Sunday. It was a very special Sunday.
[time=334] As most of you know, it was Resurrection Sunday.
[time=338] And as the family came together to celebrate Easter, we were so unbelievably blessed and so encouraged by what took place. And not only is the message of Easter, not only is the truth about Resurrection Sunday so incredible and so meaningful for those of us that know Him. It's also an amazing time because so many people come. So many people who are already convinced Christ followers who have come. Maybe they're in town visiting friends. Maybe they're new to the area. Others come though who are still on a spiritual journey. So many people come. I had a chance to meet many of them and they wouldn't consider themselves Christ followers yet.
[time=386] But they are searching. They're asking questions.
[time=390] They're reading books. They're listening to tapes and CDs. I mean God's got His hand on so many folks and they are truly seeking and we had so many of them with us. We had about 700 new people with us this past week and we are so grateful for that. One of the things that I encouraged the folks visiting to consider and one of the things I want to invite you to consider. Those of you maybe trying to find a church home or those of you still taking this spiritual journey toward faith. I would love for you to be able to take advantage of what we at Blackhawk call Access Blackhawk.
[time=430] It's a two-week offering. A two-week class where we invite folks we try and cut it off at about 25. But it's a two-week class that gives you the opportunity to ask questions to better get to know us. We get a chance to better get to know you. There's discussion that takes place. There's information that's given but also it's a wonderful opportunity in a small class setting for you to have spiritual and practical questions addressed. It's called Access Blackhawk. The name is there on the screen for you and you can find out more about Access Blackhawk and you can find out more about our ministry and our staff and the vision for ministry that God has given us here. You can find out more about that on our website at the Access Blackhawk link. If you go to blackhawkministries.org and you just click over in the gray box at the Access Blackhawk link. You can hit that and find out more and even sign up to come and be a part of a two-week class. I would love for you to come and meet some people and find out some things that I think might really be helpful for you on your journey. So check it out. Also, you'll see on our website at that same location there in the gray box just below the Access Blackhawk link there's a welcome lunch and I want to extend an invitation to those of you. Maybe many of you have been watching the broadcast. Maybe like some of the folks I met this past Sunday you've been watching and thinking about coming.

[time=568] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=592] â™ª Father God, we come before you this morning
[time=602] and on this Resurrection Sunday we offer a prayer to the
[time=608] to you shall we offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=616] We shall pay our vows to you O Lord.
[time=620] You may it be in the presence of all your people. In the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem, praise the Lord.
[time=628] Praise the Lord all nations, applaud him all peoples for his loving kindness is great toward us and the truth of the Lord is everlasting. Praise the Lord.
[time=640] Give thanks to the Lord for he is good, for his loving kindness is everlasting.
[time=648] Father God, that is our prayer. We offer it humbly to you this morning, this special morning.
[time=656] This morning like none other. God, when your son conquered death when life was truly given, we thank you for that we praise your name for it in your son's precious name.
[time=668] [AMEN - 4 seconds]
[time=674] Well, it is good to be together, amen. So nice to be able to see each other and celebrate this amazing day.
[time=682] It's one of my most favorite days of the year by far and I'm so glad that we could have this time together. I want to just as we start take you to Luke 24 and give us the opportunity to just read for ourselves the account that Luke gives us, Luke 24 1-11 as he paints a picture for us here of what took place that morning in honor of God's Word. Would you stand with me and allow me to read this to you?
[time=706] In my Bible it is marked, this section is marked the resurrection. It says, "But on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. But when they entered they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this, behold two men who weren't really men, two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling clothing, and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living one among the dead?
[time=748] He is not here, but he has risen." Remember how he spoke to you while he was still in Galilee saying that the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified.
[time=760] And the third day rise again, and they remembered his words and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary, the mother of James, also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles. But these words appeared to them as nonsense and they could and they would not believe them but in verse 12. But Peter, there's our man, but Peter got up and ran to the tomb stooping and looking in. He saw the linen wrappings only and he went away to his home marveling at what had happened.
[time=802] I'd like you to stay standing for a moment. We're here this morning standing to celebrate.
[time=810] To celebrate the single most important event in all of history, the life giving, life changing truth born out of this day we call resurrection Sunday. What a day it is. What an event in the life of the family of God. You see with all of life hanging in the balance with all of eternity at stake. Jesus Christ, the son of God conquers death destroying its consequence and diminishing once and for all its power. God wins. Amen?
[time=850] God wins. Sin loses.
[time=854] Once and for all Satan is defeated leading those of us gathered here today who know him to shout and proclaim. Amen. Say it.
[time=866] I bet you can shout it and proclaim it a little louder. Amen?
[time=870] Leading those of us here in this room who know, I mean it's worth shouting right? I mean it did save you. It did give you life.
[time=878] It has redeemed us. It has given us purpose here.
[time=882] It has given us eternity then and it leads those of us here this morning on this resurrection Sunday. It leads us to shout Jesus is alive.
[time=894] We're going to just do this for a little bit here. Okay so get your pipes warmed up.
[time=900] It leads us here in this room who know him willing to shout Jesus is alive.
[time=908] Leaves us willing to proclaim God wins.
[time=912] Leads us, those of us that know him this morning so very grateful for this life.
[time=916] It leads us to proclaim Christ conquered death.
[time=920] And to say so will I.
[time=924] So will I. Because of him. Amen?
[time=928] You can be seated. Nice job.
[time=932] Now.
[time=936] Now. If he if he didn't if he didn't conquer death if he's dead if he didn't conquer death if he's dead my friends we are all in a lot of trouble. I want you to look at what the Apostle Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15 verses 13, 14 and then 17 through 19. Paul addresses this. Look what he says. Think about this but if there's no but if there is no resurrection of the dead not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised if the resurrection of Christ didn't take place what's it say then our preaching is vain your faith also in vain and then you go on to verse 17 and if Christ has not been raised your faith it says is worthless.
[time=1000] You are still in your sins.
[time=1004] Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If we have hoped in Christ in this life only we are of all men most to be what's it say pitied.
[time=1020] If he's dead my friends if the tomb wasn't empty if he was a fraud a fake then all of this all of this is a sham.
[time=1044] All of this is a colossal waste of time because none of it's real and we've been duped.
[time=1052] I've given my life and my soul and my heart you've given your heart many of you your heart and soul and life if he's dead we've given our hearts and souls and lives to nothing I should have stayed and if that's the case I should have stayed in sports broadcasting. I don't know if I ever told you that's what I was going to do with my life. I was going to be I was going to be Bob Costas.
[time=1084] That's true I was going to be the next Jim Nance. I was going to be I was going to be doing the final four someday because I was pretty convinced that there was nothing in life more important or more serious more significant or more worthwhile than sports.
[time=1100] But he got a hold of me. Nothing wrong with being a sportscaster nothing wrong with nothing wrong with broadcasting.
[time=1108] He got a hold of me and and I was convinced and he moved in my heart and said you know what there's something I want you to give your heart and life to. I want you to give your heart and life the truth. Well if I've done that but all this is a sham then what a waste of time but you know what my friends? He's alive He is alive. The tomb was and is empty to this day. He did not stay in the grave look at what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15-20. He doesn't leave us hanging there on the to be pitied thing. No he says but in verse 20 he says but now Christ has been raised from the dead. He has been that's the reality that's what took place. He has been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who are asleep and I know in my heart today beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has been raised.
[time=1164] I know in my heart today beyond a shadow of a doubt that I serve a risen Lord that all that you and I are giving our hearts and lives to it's not in vain it's the most amazing calling of all it's the most amazing life that you and I have been given in relationship with him and you say how do you know that? Well I'll tell you how I know that I'll just tell you real quick I know that first and foremost because the perfect word the perfect enduring word of God says so and until the day comes when you come to me proving that this is wrong which nobody's done yet, invitations open, nobody has...no none of the books that have been written, none of the studies that have been done, none of the research has taken my...nobody has ever proven this to be inaccurate, wrong or false, the perfect enduring word of God says it happened and I believe it and I'll stake my life on it.
[time=1224] Those of you that like to study for those of you who would want to look into the issue, maybe at an intellectual, data based level you're welcome to do so. We would love to, I would encourage you to pick up a book called A Case for Christ. You can write that down.
[time=1244] A Case for Christ. A wonderful work done in the last four or five years looking at all of the data, looking at all of the facts, looking at all the stuff that's there at the historical precedent of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the life of Christ.
[time=1260] It's called A Case for Christ by a guy named Lee Strobel, S-T-R-O-B-E-L, and when you get down with that book, pick up a case for faith and read and take your notes and listen and think it through and if you want to talk about it, come talk about it. We did a message here. You could get a tape or a CD. We did a message here and I think it was Easter 03, a couple years ago, Easter 03, did a whole message on Easter Sunday about all the different theories that have been proposed as to what really happened on Resurrection Sunday. We looked at all of those from a biblical perspective. But I'll tell you what, aside from the Word of God, the one bit of data that convinces me beyond all else is what I have seen him do. And I'll tell you what, if you're here this morning, you want to know why I believe this?
[time=1308] We'll do it this way. If you're here this morning and the risen Lord has really, really I mean really changed you.
[time=1320] Has miraculously transformed, I don't just mean changed you, right? Tony Robbins and infomercials, they can take a stab at that. We can lose some weight and have a smile on our face, but I'm talking about real change. If the risen Lord has really, really changed you, has transformed you from this to this. And you and I know he's not done with you or me yet. There's still more work to be done. But if he has changed your life, I want you to quietly stand. Just right where you're at.
[time=1353] I want you to quietly stand. And now I want you to quietly sit down. That's all it took right there. Sit down. See when I see that when you see that, I hope you saw that. When you see that, when I see that, that's all the proof. That is aside from the Word of God, the greatest truth of all. That he is alive. That he is risen. That he is on the throne.
[time=1373] That he is the king. Is the work he does in the lives of people just like you and me. Amen? And he is changing us. He is transforming us. And this morning I'd like to take all of us through three very real and practical, everyday implications of the resurrection. Because he defeated death. Because he is who he said he was. The son of God. God in the flesh. Because he did what he said he would do. Die. And be raised from the grave three days later.
[time=1405] These three life-changing principles.
[time=1409] These three life-changing truths are true.
[time=1413] And I want to show you these three practical implications of the resurrection. Right here from the pages of Scripture. And I also want you to listen to a song. Kevin's going to come. He and Corbin are going to do a song for us right now. And I want you as they do that. I want you to listen to the words. I want you to watch the screen as the lyrics kind of move across the screen. This isn't a unique and powerful song. It's a song and its lyrics are nothing more than single words or phrases. Just a whole song of single words and phrases. Great truths.
[time=1449] All of which are possible. All of which are true only because we serve a risen Lord. A dead fraud couldn't deliver this kind of truth. Listen and be encouraged this morning as you do.
[time=1483] [MUSIC - 288 seconds]
[time=1775] And I want you this morning to be so very encouraged. First of all, write this down. Number one, he is, and we'll just go with the title as our first point.
[time=1783] He is our peacemaker. Be encouraged today, my friends. Jesus was God. He conquered death and has the power to bring peace.
[time=1791] He is the peacemaker without the resurrection.
[time=1795] Remember, without the resurrection there is no peace. None.
[time=1801] We see in the scriptures that Jesus came to a world in crisis.
[time=1805] You and I know that that world continues to stay and exist in crisis. He came to a society that was at odds, and he came to people like you and I who were in turmoil and conflict. And he offers, he says, in his coming piece.
[time=1825] I want you to look with me at John 14, 27. It's the fourth gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. If you turn, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. If you're turning in your Bibles just before you get to the book of Acts, go to John 14.
[time=1835] It says in John 14, 27, Jesus speaking here, as it relates to peace and the offering of it, he says in John 14, 27, he says, "Peace I leave with you.
[time=1847] Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you." Interesting phrase here.
[time=1853] "Not as the world gives, do I give to you? Do not let your heart be troubled,
[time=1859] nor let it be fearful." What's he saying there?
[time=1865] He says, "I give you peace. I come, and in my coming I offer you peace.
[time=1871] But it's not the kind of peace that you find in the world. It's not the kind of peace that our society or our culture offers. No, it's a different kind of peace than that. Because what our culture offers, not the kind the world offers, interesting isn't it that he continues on, "Do not let your heart be troubled?"
[time=1893] Now let me ask you a question. What kind of peace? Think with me here. Come on.
[time=1897] Engage here with me for a minute. I want you to really think about this. What kind of peace?
[time=1901] What does it look like? This peace that the world offers.
[time=1906] How does that come at us? How do we experience this worldly peace?
[time=1911] What is it that we're supposed to do these days to get peace?
[time=1915] As far as the world's perspective, I wrote a few things down.
[time=1919] The world's giving us smooth, quiet riding cars.
[time=1924] The world gives us, I laughed about this, I wrote down the world gives us earplugs.
[time=1929] I was at the park last summer with a couple of my kids.
[time=1933] Boy, park last summer feels like four years ago, doesn't it?
[time=1937] I was at the park just last summer and I got a kick out of it.
[time=1941] I noticed there's a dad, it was clearly a dad, over on the bench.
[time=1946] His kids are out here doing the swing thing, Leo Cedarville.
[time=1950] He's on the bench with a book and earplugs.
[time=1954] He was having himself a little bit of what? A little bit of peace.
[time=1959] They were going absolutely nuts. He's over here completely oblivious.
[time=1963] Earplugs and a book, all kinds of ways.
[time=1966] You and I can get peace today, supposedly.
[time=1969] You could fly first class. It's one thing that they're telling you.
[time=1973] You and I, maybe that might bring a little bit more peace.
[time=1976] You could buy something. I hear, from what I hear, purchasing something expensive often brings a sense of peace.
[time=1982] At least that's what I hear. That's what goes on often times, isn't it?
[time=1985] They're buying the trips to the mall, buying something.
[time=1989] They tell us that eating something can bring peace.
[time=1992] When you're down, when you're troubled, when things aren't going well, just have a piece of cake. Have a candy bar. Have a milkshake.
[time=1999] Have a couple. Peace offered in all kinds of different forms and fashions.
[time=2005] You could drop some cash and head to the day spa.
[time=2008] You can go three, four, five hours and get the pedicure and the manicure and the messiah.
[time=2012] You could do all that and find some peace, right?
[time=2015] You could just divorce him or her.
[time=2021] World says that's one way. You could just kind of move on.
[time=2024] Just rid yourself of the hassle, the disappointment, the hard work and sacrifice and just get divorced.
[time=2033] You could have a drink.
[time=2036] World says have a drink. World says have a couple.
[time=2039] Have two or three if you need to.
[time=2042] As many as you need to kind of numb the pain, then you'll get your peace, right?
[time=2048] You could take a pill. You could smoke.
[time=2050] I mean, all kinds of ways.
[time=2053] The world says to get peace. Peace I leave with you.
[time=2056] My peace I give to you, but it's not as the world gives it.
[time=2063] See, I would say from my personal experience and from the observations that I continue to make,
[time=2070] that all the above we just listed, though they might bring a degree of, let's just say, relief,
[time=2077] none of them bring peace if we're going to define peace as something lasting.
[time=2085] Look at what God's Word says. Jesus is all about bringing peace.
[time=2089] John 1633 says in John 1633 it says these things I have spoken to you so that in me, say that with me,
[time=2099] so that where in me he says you want peace, I'll give you peace.
[time=2104] I'll give you peace in me.
[time=2107] Very important that you noticed that right out of the gate.
[time=2110] These things I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace.
[time=2115] In the bottle, in the car, in the new spouse, no, no, no.
[time=2123] He says in me is where you get this peace that's like none other, so that in me you may have peace.
[time=2130] In the world you have tribulation, but take courage.
[time=2134] I have overcome the world.
[time=2137] He goes on, look at Philippians, Paul writes in Philippians chapter 4 verse 7 in his letter to the church at Philippi.
[time=2144] He says in the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension, all smooth riding cars, all new spouses,
[time=2154] all day spa visits, all chocolate cake, and the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds.
[time=2165] There it is again, in where? In Christ Jesus.
[time=2170] In relationship with him, he says you have peace. Romans 5-1, you can turn there if you'd like.
[time=2177] Just after the book of Acts, you come to Romans chapter 5 verse 1.
[time=2182] Paul says here as he writes to the church at Rome, listen, he says therefore, having been justified by faith,
[time=2189] we have peace with God through our, there it is again, through our Lord Jesus Christ, the peace maker, the peace giver,
[time=2199] the one who offers it.
[time=2203] Here's the difference between the world's peace and his peace, right here clearly stated.
[time=2208] In relationship with the risen Lord, we find peace people, peace of the soul.
[time=2218] There's not a smooth riding car out there.
[time=2222] There's not a pill out there.
[time=2225] There's not a new spouse out there. There isn't anything out there that brings to you or to meet peace, lasting peace of the what?
[time=2235] Of the soul.
[time=2239] How's your heart today?
[time=2244] Come on, you know, you in all honesty know the condition of your heart and soul today.
[time=2251] Are you a peace? Do you sense that? Do you know that to be true?
[time=2256] See, in relationship with him, I am.
[time=2259] It doesn't mean my peace doesn't get dinged. It doesn't mean my peace isn't rattled periodically.
[time=2265] But see, even that's not because he goes somewhere or the peace went somewhere. It's because who went somewhere?
[time=2271] It's because I went somewhere. See, sin has a way of really messing with peace.
[time=2276] But see, I know in him, I have perfect peace, lasting peace of the soul.
[time=2281] How are you today? Do you sense your heart is full in relationship with him?
[time=2287] Or do you know that outside of relationship with him, you sit here today with a heart that is broken, rattled, cracked, uneasy, confused?
[time=2305] Well, my friends, this morning, we celebrate a risen Lord who brings peace like no other.
[time=2313] He's also a fear taker. I could have picked any one of the phrases and gone with it.
[time=2317] My mind and my heart kind of came to this idea of taking fear.
[time=2321] You can write that down. Number two, our risen Lord is a fear taker.
[time=2325] Without the resurrection, there would be no answer. Think about it. No answer for anxiety.
[time=2331] None. Without the resurrection, there would be no answer for fear. No answer for uncertainty.
[time=2338] Only in Christ can our fears find the calm confidence provided by our loving Lord.
[time=2345] Without him, the anxious uncertainty of life would control and dominate all of your life in mind.
[time=2352] And just think for a moment about the things that you and I fear. Think about it.
[time=2359] Think about all the stuff that's out there that comes across your path in mind that leads to this sense of anxiety
[time=2366] that so many people today are governed by and controlled by.
[time=2372] I just wrote down a few. Will my baby be born healthy?
[time=2377] Will my baby die once he or she's been born of sids?
[time=2383] Will I ever have a baby? We think about all kinds of things.
[time=2388] Will my teenager make good decisions as he or she kind of begins to set out in life?
[time=2394] Will my teenager make good decisions? What if my biopsy comes back malignant?
[time=2400] What if I find myself sick, dying of a disease? What if he or she cheats on me and I end up alone again?
[time=2412] What if my son or daughter makes the same mistakes I did growing up?
[time=2416] What if I lose another job? What if I don't get accepted to the right college?
[time=2422] What if I don't even ever get married? What am I going to do? Where am I going to go?
[time=2429] What will life bring? What if I start to drink again?
[time=2433] What if they tease me at school again next year? What if I told someone the sins I really struggle with?
[time=2441] What if I tell people what my husband really does to me and our kids?
[time=2445] What is going to happen then? Where am I going to go then? How will this all turn out?
[time=2449] We ask those questions again and again and again as it relates to a myriad of different arenas in our lives.
[time=2457] What is going to happen? What am I going to do? How will this turn out?
[time=2461] Anxiety, anxiety, anxiety.
[time=2467] And he, our risen Lord, whose resurrection we celebrate this morning, we're told is a fear taker.
[time=2475] Let me invite you to go back to 1 Peter back toward the back of your New Testament to 1 Peter 5.
[time=2482] We've been studying this great book verse by verse here at Blackhawk in recent weeks.
[time=2487] We'll come back to that study next week. Let me take you though to 1 Peter 5.
[time=2492] It's an amazing thing. It says in 1 Peter 5.6, "Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you at the proper time."
[time=2502] He's going to take care of you in time. In the meantime, look at verse 7.
[time=2507] Casting all 1 Peter 5.7. Casting all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
[time=2519] I want you to look at that phrase. Casting all your anxiety.
[time=2524] Casting all your anxiety. We're going to start with that word cast.
[time=2530] I want you to see that word cast and I want you to know that in the original language of the New Testament, that word is a powerful word. It paints a powerful picture. It means to literally throw off.
[time=2541] It means to not just throw off. It means having thrown off to disregard,
[time=2547] to view and to see as being gone.
[time=2551] To cast off, to throw off. It's not a dropping off. It's like a, it's like a, you know what I mean?
[time=2559] You know what I mean? Like a pesky little brother or a pesky little, it's get off me.
[time=2565] It's throwing it off. It's disregarding. It's viewing is gone.
[time=2571] It's trying to think of how to illustrate that for you. And I just got to, I got to come clean today and tell you I've got to confess to you a pretty heinous sin. It's pretty bad stuff.
[time=2581] I'm in, I'm in rehabilitation for it right now with my wife. She has lovingly confronted me on this over the years
[time=2587] and we are now going through a process of restoration. I am a, I am a, I am a convicted clutter dumper.
[time=2596] And I don't know, I'm hoping there's somebody here in the room who can identify with me so I don't feel alone in this, but I just can't stand clutter.
[time=2605] Can I hear an amen? Oh thank you.
[time=2609] It's really pretty ugly and it's really pretty sad. I mean, and I'm a strange guy.
[time=2613] You, you most of you know me. I'm a weird mix because you'd think on the one hand clutter wouldn't bug me because I'm so spontaneous and I'm so outgoing and I'm so just, you know, do whatever.
[time=2623] Have a good time. I'm not very organized in many arenas of my life.
[time=2627] I just like to go and it's not a big deal, but then you come over into certain compartments of my life.
[time=2633] You come over like to my desk or to my, like at home. I'm just, it's weird. I'm a neat freak.
[time=2640] I'm embarrassed to say it, but I, but I, I just, I like things to be in order and there's something about our home.
[time=2647] Maybe your home. I just, I come across things that really takes me through the ceiling when I step on them.
[time=2653] But I'll step on things or I'll see things. Do you know what I mean? And they're just like, why is this here?
[time=2659] Why? Somebody tell me, why do we still have this? You know, and I just, so I just like what I, it, something comes over me
[time=2666] and I just start like I'll secretly get a big garbage bag and I'll start stuff and stuff.
[time=2673] I mean, I, for years I, I did this. Again, now I've been lovingly confronted. I'm in rehabilitation.
[time=2678] I'm not doing this anymore. But it was really, I mean, I could fill a bag in, I could fill a bag in ten minutes.
[time=2684] You know what I mean? Like, like socks. Like one sock. It's like, where's the other sock?
[time=2689] How many months or years is this sock going to sit here without a match? And we're going to like what?
[time=2694] We're going to find it someday? It's gone. All right? Let's put the other sock out of its misery.
[time=2700] Toys. Toys. Can I hear an amen on toys? I mean, I love the toys, but I love the toys when they work, when they, when they break, they're broken.
[time=2710] I mean, when they really break and you can't use them, but there they sit and they just keep sitting there.
[time=2716] These toys and these, and these socks and these, these, these baskets. We have bat, my wife, let's, we love baskets
[time=2723] and we put things in baskets and they're beautiful, but then when kids get ahold of baskets, baskets break and they get all weird in the straw, whatever, straw, but you know what I mean? Those longer burger things and they get all undone and they, they start laying on.
[time=2735] I just want to throw them away, but artwork by the kids. I love my kids and I love their artwork, but how many pictures of little, little pickle people do we need
[time=2745] with little stubby arms coming out of them? You know, it's like throw them away.
[time=2750] But no, no, no, we got it. We're going to, we're going to keep them and I'm going to help with that. I will not do this again.
[time=2757] But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, there's one thing I know about all the stuff over the years that I did get rid of, it's gone.
[time=2768] Right? You with me? It's gone. It got cast away. I have no idea where it is. It's gone. It's in a heat somewhere.
[time=2779] Disregarded, forgotten, gone. He says, take your fears and take your anxiety and take your what ifs and take your, oh my goodness.
[time=2792] And you take all that stuff. He says and cast it on, what's it say there? Cast it all on him, all your anxiety.
[time=2800] What's anxiety? You can write this down. Anxiety is a fear. It's a, it's a deep and residing fear regarding a future and uncertain outcome.
[time=2808] It's a deep, residing fear regarding a future and uncertain outcome.
[time=2813] And he says, throw it off. Disregarded. And give it all to me because why? Because you can't miss this. Because he cares about you.
[time=2822] He really does. And he doesn't want you living that way. He doesn't want you thinking that way. He doesn't want you governed by that stuff.
[time=2835] I want you to look at the screen. You're going to see a picture there. Two very important people in my life.
[time=2840] That's Jake Michael Bird and, and Evie Jo. And they are the two youngest kids in our family.
[time=2848] And I put their pictures up there for a reason. I love those two. I care for them deeply. And I love, I love, hear me.
[time=2858] I love the fact that at, now hear how I say this, that at this stage of life, I, me, dad, I can fix anything.
[time=2872] You with me? Now you don't see a picture of my older kids up there, right? Okay, but at this stage, are you with me?
[time=2880] I care so much for them. And when he comes down the hall with those big alligator tears running down his cheeks, and his world has come crashing down.
[time=2890] Because the battery died, I'm like, you know what, dude, we can fix that. We can't. Yeah, we go on the kitchen.
[time=2898] We break out the double A's. We insert. We throw the old ones. Oh, no, we keep the old ones. Sorry.
[time=2903] We throw the old ones away. We throw it in the toy. We hit power and boom. Life's good. Fear is gone. Anxiety diminished.
[time=2917] She can come running down the hall. She can jump in my lap. We can sit on our special chair and she can tell me what happened back in the back room with the mean brothers and sisters.
[time=2925] And I can talk to her and I can hold her and I can tell her what we're going to do. And tears can turn to a smile like that.
[time=2932] Amen? I love fixing. I love fixing their hurts. I love holding them in my eye. I love being able to come alongside and pretty much just do anything and to see the smile return.
[time=2945] He, you know what he cares for you. He loves you so much. And he wants to put his arms around you. He wants to sit you down, talk through whatever needs to be talked through.
[time=2956] Help you think through whatever might need to be thought through and give you peace and take away your fear.
[time=2965] It's one of the saddest, most heartbreaking scenes I come across in my line of work. I mean it. One of the saddest, most heartbreaking things I ever see are fearful, scared kids.
[time=2985] Isn't that just a horrible thought even to just think about? Scared kids. It shouldn't be that way, shouldn't it?
[time=2995] And whether you're five or whether you're 50. See, scared kids. The father's love is such that he wants so desperately to take that fear away.
[time=3008] He's a peacemaker, my friends. He's a fear taker. And lastly, I wrote this down here. He's a lost finder.
[time=3016] Lost. I love how the song sang about that. Without the resurrections, please, my friends, be reminded today. Without the resurrection, those missing would never find their way home.
[time=3028] The lost would never be found. Now, think about this. Of all the things, a fraud wouldn't be able to pull off. This would top the list, right?
[time=3038] I mean, a fraud or a fake might take a stab at some kind of peacemaking deal, or a fraud or a fake might throw some effort, told shouldering some fear, but living a perfect life.
[time=3049] Enduring the beating of a tortured death, conquering the grave, and supernaturally saving and transforming the souls of lost people far from God, you know what?
[time=3059] There's only one who could do that. And he did it for me, and he's done it for so many of you, and he has been doing it for hundreds and hundreds of years, finding those lost and bringing them home.
[time=3072] It's so powerful. Look at Luke 19. It says it so clearly. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and the third gospel there, it says in Luke 19, 10.
[time=3081] It says, "For the Son of Man," you see it there, "for the Son of Man has come to look, to seek Jesus Himself came." It was why He came, "for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."
[time=3098] Now, I want you to think about this. Look at that, look at that phrase. He's come to seek and to save. Think about the seeking that He's done.
[time=3109] Think about the, just do this. Think about the relentless pursuit He put forward toward you. I think about it, what He did with me.
[time=3120] I think about how hard I made that for Him. I think about the rebellion that He bumped into with me. I think about the commitment I had to my sin and the road that I was walking.
[time=3130] I think about all the things that were going on in my heart and life. I think about all the blocks I put up, all the things I tried to go and run behind.
[time=3138] Does that sound familiar to anybody? Think about the pursuit that He gave toward you. His relentless, stop it nothing mindset.
[time=3148] Because He came to seek and to save those that were lost. I think about Thanksgiving back in DC. I told you about this. We lost Jake just for a few minutes.
[time=3157] I mean, it was just three, four, five minutes at the Smithsonian. I told you about that. And I was thinking about that last night.
[time=3165] You know, again, like you in that situation, I would have stopped at nothing, right? I would have yelled as loud and as long as I would have had to.
[time=3172] I would have run as fast or as far as I would have needed to. I would have fought anyone. I would have climbed anything. I would have gone and gone and gone and gone.
[time=3182] I would never have rested. I would never have stopped, right?
[time=3187] And His love. And His love for you. And His love for me. So much greater. So much bigger. It's so much broader than that. He came to seek and to save those of you in this room who were and are lost.
[time=3203] Save. It's a great word. We've studied it recently. We've been studying here at Black Hawk, the great truth of redemption, how in our sinfulness we are separated from God, how in our sinfulness, in our in our feudal life, He comes and He buys, He pays the price. That was on Friday.
[time=3219] He pays the price. The Son is sacrificed. He pays the price. He redeems us. He buys us back out of sin. He came to seek and He stops at nothing.
[time=3230] And when He finds you and I, He draws us to Him. And He saves us. He redeems us. He gives us a life that's not futile. No, He gives us a life that's full.
[time=3241] He came to seek and save. That which was lost. You may sit here today and say, "You know what? I don't like that phrase lost."
[time=3250] You know, you used the word missing before. That might be better. Well, either way. But you know what? It's important for you and I to realize that with sin, back up, it's important for you and I to realize that in God's creation,
[time=3265] in the way that He designed you and I, in the way that He made us, see, He made us to live in relationship with Him. That's how you were designed to live in a perfect, unbroken relationship with a living God.
[time=3276] And Adam and Eve come along and then there's the sin of Genesis chapter 3 and we call it the fall. And when sin comes in, the relationship is severed.
[time=3284] And you and I go over here and He stays here and we start doing all kinds of stuff, thinking all kinds of things. And we start going down roads.
[time=3293] There's something in us that wants to get where. There's something in us that wants to get home, but we're what? We're lost.
[time=3301] We don't have the right map. We're not going down the right street. And the Spirit of God comes and begins to draw us to Him.
[time=3311] And what was once a confused journey becomes a very clear path and we're found.
[time=3318] The Son of Man came to seek and He may be doing that with you today. He might be doing that with you today. He may be reaching into the depths of your heart saying, "Hey, you know what? It's time for you to find some peace.
[time=3332] It's time for you to allow me to take your fear. It's time for you to allow me to bring you home.
[time=3338] If you would, I'd like everyone of you to pull out the sheet that you were given on your way in. I hope you got one. It's kind of a half-page deal there that has the visual of peacemaker on the top.
[time=3349] It's got all the lyrics done so creatively there. And then underneath it gives you a chance to just think through some things.
[time=3357] And I want to give you that opportunity. We want to give you that opportunity today. Many of you in the room may be in a good place.
[time=3363] Today may be for you an opportunity to simply celebrate and bask in the relationship that you have with Him.
[time=3369] Others of you here in the room, you may want to just give some thought to that. Go ahead, read through there. There's some options for you.
[time=3375] There's some questions that it asks. It gives you a chance to share with us. If you choose, it gives you a chance to share with us ways in which maybe we can help you on your spiritual journey.
[time=3385] You may need to let Him bring peace. You may need to let Him ease and erase your fear. Let Him lead you home. Remember today only a risen resurrected Lord can do that.
[time=3397] Look at that sheet. Would you fill that out for us? If you'd be so kind and if you'd be open to our assistance, we would love to be able to come alongside you in any way mentioned there.
[time=3408] And if you'll just fill that out this morning before you leave and on your way out, if you'll just give that to a greeter, you could give that to me.
[time=3415] We'll have other staff guys up here in the front who you could give it to. You know what? You could give it to one of the folks at the guest center. They'd be happy to take that from you.
[time=3423] But make sure you get one of those cards. Fill that out and let us know how we could come alongside you. We would absolutely love to on this day of all days.
[time=3433] We would love to be able to help, encourage, and see you down this road. We're so thankful that you're here. So thankful for the family of God here at Black Hawk.
[time=3441] So thankful for what we got to celebrate Friday night with pathway in St. Joe. Wasn't that sweet, amen? What a wonderful, wonderful time.
[time=3449] And let me just ask if you would just stand this morning. And as you stand, let me just ask if you would to bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=3457] And God, please know in our hearts that as we stand in humility before you this morning, God, as we stand and recognize what a miraculous event, what an amazing event it is, what a life-changing event.
[time=3475] For millions of people through the course of time, God, what took place on this day is like none other God. And we are so grateful for what it means.
[time=3485] We're so thankful for the life that it gives, not just here, but for all of eternity. And God, we pray. God, we ask that because of what we have seen and experienced today, God, because of you in us, God, because of this life-saving relationship that we have
[time=3502] and have the privilege of experiencing with you, God, that we could leave these doors today and that we could live like the redeemed.
[time=3510] God, that you would give us strength to live like people who have experienced real peace, to live like people, God, who know what it's like to have fear removed, and God that we would do our best to see every encounter as a divine appointment.
[time=3525] God, that we would do our very best with your help to see every relationship and every single person you bring across our path.
[time=3533] God, as an opportunity to extend a hand of love and kindness and compassion. God, that we could be used in some small way to help missing lost people find their way home.
[time=3545] God, may it be so among these people, and God, may you be praised, and may all glory and honor be given to you, and all the people agreed and said amen.
