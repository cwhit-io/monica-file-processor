[time=60] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Mitch, a teaching pastor here
[time=87] at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=88] And I wanna thank you again for joining us.
[time=90] And I want you to know that you're always invited to Common Ground on Wednesday nights at 6.45 to 8.15 p.m.
[time=97] It's our Wednesday night worship service and we're in a series.
[time=100] We're finishing up the series entitled Moving Through Conflict Toward Community.
[time=106] It's a study of proverbs and wisdom and it's just been really helpful to apply God's word and God's wisdom to our circumstances and our lives.
[time=115] You're joining us for a message in the series when holiness meets hostility.
[time=120] It's a verse by verse study of 1 Peter and today we're gonna examine the priesthood of all believers, the fact that anyone who fully surrenders his or her life to Christ is now part of a spiritual house, Peter says.
[time=135] A spiritual house that's alive and vibrant that offers spiritual sacrifices to the Lord.
[time=142] We're gonna talk about what that means and one that is founded on Jesus Christ who is alive.
[time=151] And Peter tells us that our role is to work together to make the community, the church, the local church more important than any one individual.
[time=160] And that was our mindset in the Eastern culture and to live out the life of Christ to those who are hurting, to those who are unbelieving so that they will indeed see Christ.
[time=176] There's this imagery used of living stones and talks about Jesus from the Old Testament being called the cornerstone, the cornerstone.
[time=184] And it's really, really interesting.
[time=187] You'll hear me address it in the message on what the cornerstone actually was.
[time=191] It was, it had really three purposes.
[time=193] The first purpose was it was the foundational stone.
[time=197] It provided the support for the entire structure.
[time=202] So it was the foundation.
[time=203] The second thing is it would connect two walls at right angles that would set on top of it.
[time=209] So it not only supported, but it would connect, it would connect the walls of the building.
[time=217] And then the third thing, really interesting, the third thing that the cornerstone did, its function, was that every single stone in the building or in the temple, if we wanna use the imagery, that Peter uses, was measured and aligned with this benchmark cornerstone.
[time=238] So it's really interesting, support as the foundation, the cornerstone provided that role.
[time=246] Connecting the two walls that came together at right angles, it would connect.
[time=251] And then it would align.
[time=252] Every single stone would be aligned with this stone.
[time=255] And so it just makes me wanna ask in my own life, and what about yours, is Christ the foundation?
[time=261] Have you fully surrounded your life to Him?
[time=263] And every thought, every feeling, every action, every choice, is based on Christ being the foundation of your life.
[time=270] Second, are you connected with Him in a way that connects you with others?
[time=278] Are you so connected with Him that when you connect with another human being, they actually become connected with Christ.
[time=285] That doesn't need to be for sentences that you say to them or attract that you hand them per se, but with your life, do you reveal?
[time=293] Do I reveal my connection with Christ?
[time=297] And then third, is my life aligned with Christ?
[time=302] Is He the benchmark of my life?
[time=306] Is the measurement of my life?
[time=307] Am I being measured by the life of Christ?
[time=310] Is He my benchmark?
[time=312] I had a friend of mine tell me today, he said, "Hey, Mitchell, I grew up "when used to farm and plant only two rows at a time." He said, "It was really interesting, "you could look at different farmers "and whether they had two row planners "or more multiple row planners." He said, "You'd look at their lines "and they'd either be straight or they'd be kind of wiggly." And he said, "The squiggly lines came from, "what my dad used to tell me." He says, "My dad used to tell me that when you're planning, "if you want a straight line, don't look down right next
[time=349] "to the wheels of the tractor." He said, "Rather, look beyond towards the end of the row "and you'll have a straighter line." In our lives, we need to look at eternity, the eternity factor in order to be measured with Christ's heart today.
[time=370] We need to have eternity in mind and our paths will be straighter.
[time=374] Hey, grab a cup of coffee, take a look, listen, get your Bible open to 1 Peter 2 verses 4 through 10, and just ask yourself these questions about yourself, about your life being aligned with Christ, about him being your foundation, about being connected with him so much that you connect other people and just let the Holy Spirit do the rest.
[time=394] You're always invited here with us on Sunday mornings at 9 a.m. in 1045, thanks again.

[time=501] - And Father, we come together this morning to declare
[time=508] that we will live for you, that we want to offer our bodies this morning as living sacrifices.
[time=514] Holy and pleasing in your sight, we give you our hands and our life and our voice and our will and all those things we sang about God, we declare this morning that they belong to you.
[time=525] We have been transformed and transitioned from being slaves to sin, to being slaves to your righteousness.
[time=535] And Father, we know that joy comes from being a slave to you.
[time=539] And we're so thankful for the joy that you offer in our slavery to your righteousness.
[time=544] God, it's better than one day and anywhere else, better than a thousand days, anywhere else, Father.
[time=550] We just love you and adore you and pray that you would be gracious to us now as we listen to the teaching of your word.
[time=559] God, would you be gracious enough to open our ears and our eyes to the truth that we need to hear?
[time=565] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=577] [MUSIC] Why [MUSIC] Do we do the things we do [MUSIC] How can we sing [MUSIC] When there's no reason to [MUSIC] How do we smile [MUSIC] When there's not much to smile about [MUSIC] When the world is down [MUSIC] So are we to stand and shout [MUSIC] And they wonder why [MUSIC] We do the things we do [MUSIC] It's all because of this [MUSIC] It's all because of this [MUSIC] We're taste and buzz [MUSIC] Taste and hope [MUSIC] Taste and hope in this [MUSIC] It's all because of this [MUSIC] It's all because of this [MUSIC] We're taste and buzz [MUSIC] Taste and hope [MUSIC] Taste and hope again [MUSIC]

[time=661] [MUSIC] Two months is too little [MUSIC] They let it go [MUSIC] They had no sudden healing [MUSIC] To think that Providence would [MUSIC] Take a child from his mother while she prays [MUSIC] Is appalling [MUSIC] Who told us we'd be rescued [MUSIC] What has changed and why should we be saved [MUSIC] From nightmares [MUSIC] We're asking why this happens [MUSIC] To us who have died to me [MUSIC] It's unfair [MUSIC] This is what it means to be him [MUSIC] How it feels when the sacred is torn from life [MUSIC] And you've survived [MUSIC] This is what it is to be loved [MUSIC] And to know that the promise was [MUSIC] When everything fell, we'd be helped [MUSIC] This hand is bitterness [MUSIC] We wanna taste and let the hatred end up [MUSIC] Our sorrow [MUSIC] The wise home opens slowly [MUSIC] To lilies of the valley end [MUSIC] Tomorrow [MUSIC] This is what it means to be him [MUSIC] How it feels when the sacred is torn from life [MUSIC] And you've survived [MUSIC] This is what it is to be loved [MUSIC] And to know that the promise was [MUSIC] When everything fell, we'd be helped [MUSIC] If hope is born of suffering [MUSIC] If this is only the beginning [MUSIC] Can we not wait for what I'm watching for [MUSIC] I'll save yours [MUSIC] This is what it means to be him [MUSIC] How it feels when the sacred is torn from life [MUSIC] And you've survived [MUSIC] This is what it is to be loved [MUSIC] And to know that the promise was [MUSIC] When everything fell, we'd be helped [MUSIC] Yeah [MUSIC] What they have [MUSIC] Whoa, this is what it is to be loved [MUSIC] And to know that the promise was [MUSIC] When everything fell, we'd be helped [MUSIC] This is what it means to be him â™ª
[time=3441] - Would you please stand?
[time=3455] Let's pray.
[time=3467] God made this community, this spiritual house, come along Mike and Bethany through their struggle.
[time=3477] God made a world know us and pry our love.
[time=3483] God made we build our lives on you, the living cornerstone.
[time=3489] May we align our every choice with you, the benchmark,
[time=3495] the living cornerstone, your life.
[time=3497] We can seek you and ask you and pray to you.
[time=3499] God made evangelism just be a byproduct
[time=3505] of our surrender to you so that other people would know us by our love, by our mercy and come to know you.
[time=3514] Remind of the people who came to the funeral
[time=3520] who probably did not know you, but they were drawn by your life and your love through Mike and Bethany and their friends and what they saw, day in and day out.
[time=3534] God make us a people who are living and vibrant for you, a spiritual house.
[time=3541] May each one of us be in community and small groups in discipleship relationships and may evangelism just be a byproduct because every single person we meet will see your light and be drawn to you.
[time=3554] May it be so in this place.
[time=3556] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=3584] (gentle music)
