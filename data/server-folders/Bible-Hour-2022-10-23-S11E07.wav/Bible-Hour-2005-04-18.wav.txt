[time=53] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=67] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all news, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=80] of the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=89] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=95] the end of the age, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=125] I will worship you, I will worship you, I will worship you, sing and I will worship you,
[time=165] you, I will worship you, if you think that I am, I will worship you, when I need love
[time=176] I am, I will worship you, when I won't change, don't I will sing and put face in that you
[time=186] are my God, I will worship you, if you think that I am, I will worship you.
[time=194] Let it of I am, I will worship you, I will worship you, I will worship you, I will worship you,
[time=272] I will worship you, I will worship you, I will worship you, I will worship you, I will worship
[time=587] for this I give you the praise.
[time=617] Do we do the things we do, how can we sing, when there's no reason to how do we smile,
[time=633] when there's not much to smile about, when the world is down, who are we to stand and shout,
[time=644] and they wonder why we do the things we do, it's all because of this, it's all because of this,
[time=658] it's all because of this, it's all because of this, it's all because of this, it's all because of this,
[time=678] they wonder why we do the things we do.
[time=698] Wow, what a beginning to the morning, amen?
[time=705] For this we give him praise, I just kind of wanted to clap longer and say amen, what a wonderful,
[time=712] wonderful privilege we have, I hope you never, ever, ever take for granted. The privilege that
[time=718] we have each week to come and gather and do what Corbin and the team just let us in, it is a privilege
[time=725] to worship our God in that way, a joy to lift our voices together, I hope you come in through those
[time=731] doors each week ready to do that with all of your heart and what a treat to get to do it with you this morning, it's great to be back, it is so good to see all of you, we missed you, we had a great,
[time=743] great couple of weeks away, I'm so thankful for our elders who allow me to take times like that
[time=749] with our family, we went back, it was great, we went back to California, back to the old stomp and grounds and you know it's an amazing thing, I never had a home growing up, I lived in 18 different
[time=762] houses in about six different states by the time I was 17, most of you know my dad was in
[time=768] ministry and we moved around a lot, I never felt like I had a home and then I ended up in LA in
[time=776] Southern California for about 16, 15, 16 years before we came here, so I had finally, after all
[time=783] those years I had finally found a home and I had found a lot of friends and Kebra and I were married
[time=789] there, we spent 10 years of those 16 together there in Southern California and so it was a hard
[time=795] thing to move, we moved from LA to Fort Wayne in January, that was hard enough, January of '96 and
[time=804] the first couple two three years admittedly were quite a transition for us on a number of fronts
[time=811] but I'm here to tell you we really, really, really missed all of you and it is so nice to be
[time=818] home that I got to be honest that first Sunday I didn't miss you that much, I was playing golf
[time=828] by the ocean but I got to be honest with you, last week we had gotten home
[time=834] like through midnight on Saturday down in India and then got home here to Fort Wayne by about 3am
[time=841] and I laid there in bed Sunday morning, there was no way physically I was going to get up but mentally I so wanted to be here and to see all of you and it's great to be home, we had a great,
[time=853] great week and as much as I love you I got to say I'm disappointed in you, not one single stinking person saved me a donut, no Krispy Kreme's on my desk, no nothing, no icing on the pew, no
[time=868] anything, no donut at all but all is forgiven and it's great to be together again, amen.
[time=875] We'll open your Bibles if you would to 1 Peter, we have the joy of continuing on in our study of
[time=881] this great book I'm so thankful for Mitchell Cruz who faithfully took you through the beginning
[time=887] portions of chapter 2, we come this morning to chapter 2 verses 11 and 12 and I want to just remind you if I can briefly where we've been so far as far as a theme in our study of
[time=898] 1 Peter, anybody who's been around for the last oh eight, nine weeks or so now I think would be able to articulate the fact that what we see here is a letter being written by Peter, Peter writes to
[time=910] believers who are scattered, many of them in the area of Rome and this is a group of believers,
[time=916] this is a band of Christ followers who are undergoing severe persecution, we know from this book
[time=923] itself we know from church history that this was a time when Nero brought great torture and great
[time=929] persecution and great heartache against these first century followers of Christ, he hated them,
[time=935] he blamed them falsely for the burning down of Rome and everywhere you went in this culture and
[time=942] this time folks were against Christians and they were being kidnapped and they were being fed to
[time=948] lions and they were being lit on fire as tiki torches at garden parties and you know when you
[time=954] hear about that and you read about that and you get a clear picture of all that transpired of the many things that you and I see and learn from that one of them is this and not only is this true here
[time=966] in this case but we see this all throughout history my friends all throughout the annals of time
[time=972] wherever there is persecution wherever there is difficulty wherever there is heartache wherever
[time=978] there is ill treatment you always see the cream rise to the top persecution has a way of breeding
[time=985] full devotion does that make sense you see because in the midst of persecution in the midst of
[time=992] ill treatment you have to choose one way or the other you are either going to throw it in reverse
[time=998] quick and get out of the heat or you are going to stand firm and when you stand firm in the
[time=1007] midst of persecution it hurts there's pain there's suffering and it is the fully surrendered
[time=1015] it is the fully devoted the truly saved that are willing and able to endure in persevere through
[time=1022] the heartache and today I'm so excited our passage breaks down this notion our passage
[time=1028] kind of paints a picture if you will of this notion of a fully surrendered relationship with Christ
[time=1035] that's right our passage today kind of shows us the two basic fundamental components of what it
[time=1042] looks like when you and I are willing to respond and live out our faith with a fully surrendered
[time=1049] fully devoted heart there are two very important spiritual principles at work
[time=1055] in a fully surrendered heart two very important arenas of spiritual personal living that I want
[time=1063] us to look at eventually as we come to our passage this morning but first of all let me just be clear for a moment about this issue of and this phrase that you oftentimes hear us
[time=1075] articulated is that it is a principle you oftentimes have heard us preach and share with you and with
[time=1082] so many others you'll hear us talk often about fully surrendered and I want to make sure today
[time=1088] that we're that we're clear on a couple of things several times in the past you've pulled us aside in the hallway or you've written us an email just asking for clarity about what it really means to be fully surrendered and oftentimes what's behind your question is that you you want to be
[time=1104] but and you think you are but you realize in the midst of everyday life that you're not and so you're kind of wondering how all this works well let me just try my best to clarify for you why it is and how it is the Bible speaks to this issue and how it is that we speak to this notion of a fully surrendered Christ follower there is a time in life for me it was September 1983
[time=1129] in the back row of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley California at the end of an evening service
[time=1135] where the teacher had just made his way through Romans 7 and on that night I came to a point in my
[time=1142] life when I absolutely and completely fully gave my entire heart and life to him I realized my sin
[time=1150] fullness I realized that my sin had separated me from a holy God and I wanted to be in relationship
[time=1158] with him I wanted purpose and meaning in life I needed my sin forgiven and I wanted to spend
[time=1165] eternity with him and so there came this point in time when I fully surrendered my heart and life
[time=1171] to him we call that salvation salvation fully surrendered at a point in time September
[time=1180] 1983 Grace Community Church right now every day since then God has had me like it says in
[time=1193] Philippians 1 6 and Philippians 1 6 it says he who began a good work and you will complete it
[time=1200] he's going to finish what he started see God began a work in you and I at this point and then we
[time=1206] from that day forward we begin to walk this road called following Christ we begin to live out our
[time=1213] faith we begin to live in a fully surrendered relationship with him on a day by day basis now
[time=1220] you and I know that day by day moment by moment things happen choices get made
[time=1227] you and I at times go the go the wrong direction
[time=1233] sin takes place confession is needed and we do that and having done that I I realign
[time=1243] myself with him again I get back up and by his grace and by his mercy and with his help I
[time=1249] walk again on that path this is called my friend's sanctification the process of sanctification
[time=1255] being made more and more as the days go by being made more and more into his likeness
[time=1261] being made more and more like him and it takes a daily for me I'll just be honest with you it's
[time=1267] almost like a moment by moment full surrender so yes it is something that takes place at a point
[time=1275] in time as it relates to salvation it is a decision it is a choice that we make on a regular basis
[time=1281] right as we live out our faith fully surrendered and it is the fully surrendered the saved
[time=1290] and those being sanctified it is the fully surrendered follower of Christ who was able to
[time=1296] by his grace and with his strength stand up in the midst of what you and I face on that journey
[time=1303] and one thing you and I have come to realize I know I can speak for most of you one thing that you and I have come to realize for certain is that the sanctification process
[time=1315] of everyday fully surrendered living is an everyday battle it is a fight my friends our attempts
[time=1326] to live out our faith our efforts even though energized by the very spirit of God those efforts
[time=1333] come under constant attack those efforts come under direct spiritual fire every moment of every day
[time=1343] of every week of every month year after year and you know what that's the way it has always been
[time=1350] it's important for you and I to remember this I came across a quote this week I want to share
[time=1357] it with you this morning I don't usually share quotes that are this lengthy but I felt like it was of great importance and very insightful and something I wanted you all to be able to just think through and kind of put your arms around if you will it's from a man named Wilbur Smith a great historian and church theologian from the early 19th century and he wrote this many many
[time=1379] years ago I found it fascinating read along with me let me read it for you at first one would think
[time=1386] that a religion which exalts and seeks to follow the only perfect and righteous man whoever who has
[time=1392] ever lived on this earth who never harmed anyone whose words delivered from superstition and fear
[time=1398] whose works redeemed from pain demons death and hunger whose life was a great shaft of light shot
[time=1407] into the murky darkness of the Roman world in that sensual and skeptic century who died because he
[time=1413] loved us and who always sought to bring men into communion with God to bestow upon them eternal
[time=1421] life and a home in heaven one would have thought that such a character and the religion which is
[time=1427] life and work on earth established would have been welcomed with open arms the first moment it was
[time=1435] announced and would by its very message the good works which flowed from it and the hope which it
[time=1442] established never know opposition one would have thought that that all of that would have never
[time=1448] known opposition or attack or denunciation except from the demons of hell and satan who was a liar
[time=1456] and a murderer from the beginning but such has not been its history in fact the new testament itself
[time=1464] from the records of the birth of our lord down to the end of st. john's vision of the era of anarchy
[time=1471] the book of revelation and the persecution to come testifies in the most startling way
[time=1478] to the fact that christ himself was most viciously and constantly attacked that his apostles suffered
[time=1485] the same opposition and that it was predicted by these very apostles that christianity
[time=1493] you and i would continue so to suffer down to the end of this age
[time=1502] it has always been that way it is that way and it will always be that way
[time=1516] suffering and persecution antagonism and attack will always be present until our final day
[time=1524] and in light of the great truth found today in our text it is very important i believe that
[time=1532] we pause here this morning and take in this never-ending truth that this reality my friends that this
[time=1541] side of heaven the attack against you and the attack against me the attack and the antagonism
[time=1547] that the enemy will bring against our faith will never subside and you and i know that that attack
[time=1556] comes in all kinds of forms people people will disappoint you people will hurt you trust will be
[time=1566] broken relationships will be severed choices will be made great pain will be introduced into your
[time=1573] arena and mine circumstances will be challenging things won't make sense great loss and heartbreak
[time=1581] will be encountered and i want to remind you just briefly here this morning who's behind it all
[time=1591] we've already referred to him we saw him referred to in the quote just a moment ago and to do so
[time=1597] let me take you to second Corinthians chapter 11 open your bibles to second Corinthians chapter
[time=1603] 11 the ultimate source of the attack the ultimate source of the antagonistic hatred that will be
[time=1612] aimed and fired at you and i until the day we die his hatred of the faith is so great he detests
[time=1620] our lord and all that is good true and right second Corinthians 11 i'm going to read in a book
[time=1629] by a wonderful author with great great insights Beth Moore is her name when godly people do
[time=1637] ungodly things is the title of the book she notes in one of the early chapters this passage in second
[time=1643] Corinthians 11 three let me read it for you here this morning it says this is Paul now listen look up here real quick before you look anywhere else just look at me for a moment this is Paul Paul's writing to the church at Corinth my friends this was a this was a church this was a family
[time=1660] of believers that he loved deeply Paul had spent Paul had spent time investing in these folks Paul
[time=1667] had spent time living life with these folks Paul had taught them Paul had discipled and Paul had given himself to this work at Corinth now Paul's away from Corinth and he's writing and he's concerned
[time=1679] he loved him and something happens you would know this i i would know this see something happens
[time=1689] when you love somebody when you really care for them spiritually and physically and personally
[time=1695] there's a bond that is developed yeah i couldn't wait i couldn't wait for the opportunity i
[time=1704] i could hardly sleep last night truth i was so looking forward to getting to see you
[time=1712] and god hasn't disappointed it is so sweet to stand here right now and to look at you
[time=1719] and see you have to understand that when i look at you see we've been through a lot
[time=1726] you and i i can look at faces in this room and i can think of the i can think of the dark days
[time=1733] that we've faced together i can think of the heartache that we've kind of hugged each other and prayed each other through i can think of the joys i can think of the victories i can look at faces and i i've told you before i see stories and i see them unfolding and i realize the history
[time=1750] we've had the places you've gone and the progress that god's made and it is so good to be able to
[time=1757] be together and i i uh in a in a healthy way i hope most of the time i worry i care about you
[time=1767] and i know you care about others in your life that you have spiritually made progress with
[time=1774] listen to what paul says paul says in second karenthians 11-3 he says but i am i am afraid
[time=1781] paul says but i am afraid that as the serpent deceived eve by his craftiness
[time=1790] your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to christ
[time=1799] do you see that paul was afraid terrified
[time=1805] you and i i think within appropriate bounds again we're not in any way here
[time=1814] kind of removing god from this picture and his great power and his great deliverance right
[time=1820] but yet in this immediate picture you and i i believe today in light of all that you face and
[time=1827] in light of all that i know i face there's an understanding there as to why he would be terrified
[time=1835] right and what a sobering thought did you did you catch go back to that verse who
[time=1843] who is he who is he terrified who's he afraid for is he afraid for the half-hearted
[time=1850] is he afraid for the guy or gal is he afraid for the christ follower who's not really following
[time=1857] is he is he afraid for the the partially surrendered no see understand right now folks if you're in that camp the enemy doesn't really care
[time=1867] much about you because you're not doing any good the enemy is about distracting from and
[time=1874] diminishing the work of the kingdom and what strikes me is i read that verse is he doesn't want their money one he does not want their minds to be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion the enemy has set his sights on the purely devoted the enemy will do everything
[time=1893] he can to squish and diminish and destroy the efforts and the ministry of and the lives of those
[time=1899] purely fully sincerely devoted charles spurgen the great preacher painted a picture of the enemy
[time=1908] and he used these words right here spurgen said there is nothing listen to this so there is nothing that satan can do that he does not do don't forget that we may be half
[time=1920] hearted but he never is he is the very image of ceaseless industry and untiring earnestness
[time=1929] he will do all that can be done in the time of his permitted rage we may be sure that he
[time=1936] will never lose a day he is that devoted he is that committed he is that given to your ruin and mine
[time=1948] and if you're one who stands here today and says hey you know what i want to honor god with my life
[time=1954] you're if you're a high school student if you're if you're a college age young adult if you're a young married couple if you're family with kids if you're a grandma and grandpa anybody in the room
[time=1965] if your proclamation if your decree is hey i'm in and i want to follow christ and i want to honor
[time=1972] god with my life then you whoever you are you are square he has got you squarely in his target
[time=1981] and he is going to you can bet come after you he was ceaseless in his industry and craftiness and i want to ask you this morning if that's his posture and it is
[time=1995] this total constant absolute aggression against what is right and true if that's his strategy to
[time=2001] come at you and i with that kind of relentless pursuit what's yours what is our posture to be
[time=2010] how are we to stand in the midst of that and respond to that kind of persecution that kind
[time=2018] of temptation that kind of attack how will you position yourself daily moment by moment
[time=2026] my hope and prayer would be that you and i both would face each new day each new hour with a hard
[time=2033] and life fully his fully surrendered to christ and what will that entail while these two things
[time=2040] these two fundamentals of full surrender let's look at the scriptures in first peter chapter two
[time=2049] verses 11 and 12 and in honor of god's word would you stand took us a little while to get there
[time=2055] but we did first peter two 11 through 12 the fundamentals of full surrender
[time=2061] says in first peter two 11 beloved i urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from
[time=2071] fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul keep your verse 12 keep your behavior excellent
[time=2078] among the Gentiles so that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers they may because
[time=2085] of your good deeds as they observe them glorify god in the day of visitation let's pray father god
[time=2094] we stand humbly before you so very thankful that we can so grateful that we can bring the reality
[time=2105] the truth about each and every one of us in this room to you today god we can bring
[time=2111] ourselves and we can open our hearts and minds to the life changing eternity altering truth of your
[time=2118] word and whatever trials we might be facing whatever challenges may be looming whatever victories
[time=2125] god we may be experiencing god in all of life we can come and find renewed hope renewed strength
[time=2131] others can come and find not renewed hope but hope for the very first time god i pray if there are those in the room whose journey is coming to an end in that sense if if
[time=2142] in fact they're here and they find themselves ready in their heart to respond to your calling
[time=2148] god i pray that your word today and your spirit today and your people here in this room today would only assist in that process father thank you for what we are about to study may it change us and
[time=2160] grow us in your precious son's name we pray and they all agreed and said amen well let's just make
[time=2167] our way through the text shall we beginning at verse 11 it says their beloved i urge you
[time=2173] beloved i urge you some things to take note of before we actually get into the
[time=2180] before we actually get into the outline the passage begins with the greek word agapatoy
[time=2188] you don't have to write that down it's not that important there's just some things about it i wanted to point out to you one very important thing worth taking note of this passage begins
[time=2199] with this phrase beloved agapatoy the niv says dear friends the king james says dearly beloved
[time=2206] now the problem with those two translations is that you don't really even come close
[time=2213] to the to the natural inference that's made there the inference i think that's needed to set the tone for what peta is about to say see he isn't he isn't just greeting these folks
[time=2224] my friends this isn't just hey my friends this is not hey buddies this is not hey dudes or hello my
[time=2231] dearly beloved brothers and sisters no this greek word is used to speak not even primarily of peters
[time=2238] love for these people although he loved them this word in the greek speaks to the love of god
[time=2244] for these people peta is reminding these people of something that i i realize for some of you in
[time=2254] the room this is uh for for a few of us in the room this is kind of a common deal for others of
[time=2260] us in the room and for others of those that he was dealing with this was a very very special very very unique thing you see there were a lot of folks who hadn't ever really experienced love especially the love of a who a father and he he's about to he's about to get into it with
[time=2282] them here we got some serious things to cover in these next few verses but he wants to begin by
[time=2289] reminding them and he begins by reminding you you are the the best translation would be the
[time=2296] loved the the unique loved ones of god he loves you you are you are his precious children it's as
[time=2307] if he said dearly redeemed my my my dearly saved my precious spiritual child with all that you're
[time=2317] facing let's just start right here he says remember the great god almighty loves you
[time=2323] and i think that's pertinent i think it's very important for you and i to remember
[time=2330] whenever he's about to move us down a road whenever he's about to bring us some teaching whenever he's about to kind of chisel away and and shape us in our character you need to be reminded that you and i are loved by god by god almighty why does he do this well he wanted them to be
[time=2348] very much aware of their position before god prior to presenting a very solemn reminder
[time=2357] for them to follow and here it is in first peter to verse 11 as soon as he reminds them that they
[time=2364] are the loved ones of god he says look at your text he says i urge you beloved dearly loved ones of
[time=2375] god now here peter says god speaking god speaking to them through peter says to them i urge you
[time=2383] i urge you the king james says i beseech you the n_i_v_ and n_a_s_b_ says urge in truth the best
[time=2393] translation would be watch this the best translation of this would be dearly loved ones of god i god through peter speaking to you god says to you i god saying to you
[time=2405] i beg you dot dot dot please
[time=2413] god says i need to talk to you about something here that's really really important
[time=2421] and all my friends he says i am i am begging god is begging you and i dot dot dot oh please
[time=2431] it's begging us
[time=2439] to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul
[time=2447] or the god of the universe speaking through peter directly to believers and passionately
[time=2457] and earnestly he is pleading and begging for their attention and cooperation
[time=2466] why well i want you to think about this for a minute with me here
[time=2473] this issue that he's addressing this war that is being waged against your soul in the form of
[time=2487] fleshly lusts it was no doubt right it was no doubt prevalent in this culture that peter writes to
[time=2498] yes or no yeah i mean it was going on everywhere i mean they were doing in the temples i mean it
[time=2504] was just out of control this fleshly lust thing and so god wants let's back up
[time=2515] remember this all god ever wanted was a people right all god ever wanted was a people who would
[time=2526] be his and not only would they be his but they would be distinctively his right it's the nation
[time=2534] of israel it's the whole jewish nation thing is his love for these people his people
[time=2540] who he called to live out their faith in jahova to live out their love for god
[time=2547] and to in doing so be a distinct witness and testimony to the nations that were around them
[time=2554] right it's all god ever wanted was a people who would live distinctively different
[time=2563] and they didn't most of you in the room know the story as the old testament unfolds and as god
[time=2571] graciously forgives the compromise and as god graciously forgives the lack of integrity and as
[time=2577] they wander off and intermarry with other non believing nations and as they basically kind of
[time=2584] when it's all said and done i mean they kind of do everything he asked them not to do they're not faithful they don't live distinctively different they get all messed up and he's faithful and
[time=2596] and they repent and then and then they sin and then he's faithful and they repent i mean it was just this long progression till we finally get down to the end of the old testament and we know that he's going to provide for his people when it's all said and done but at the end
[time=2610] there he basically says as he turns his eyes toward the church you know what i'm going to go and i'm going to try this with a new people and this new people is the church and so god through the work
[time=2625] of what Jesus Christ did there and the gospels and as the apostles go forward and as the church is
[time=2631] birthed god says this is my bride and through my church my hope through you and me through the
[time=2639] church my hope is that you would be distinct that you would be different that you would be smack
[time=2647] dab in the middle of whatever culture i have you in that you would be a shining light giving glory
[time=2653] to god representing by the very way you conduct yourselves showing and evidencing the character of
[time=2659] god and when you when you look at that whole picture from the old testament to the new testament
[time=2667] and when you realize the role and the calling of the church it's not real surprising
[time=2674] when you see god begging you in the midst of this culture to abstain from something that not many
[time=2687] are abstaining from amen what amazing truth so peter reminds them that they are the loved ones of god
[time=2700] he reminds them that they are the loved ones of god and then begs for their attention as he asks
[time=2706] them to remember that as christians they are aliens go back to your text i urge you he begs them to
[time=2713] give attention as he asks them to remember that as christians as followers of christ they are
[time=2719] aliens and strangers here in this human sphere some texts translate those words pilgrims and so
[time=2729] journers the word literally means watch this uh the idea there is to literally in the greek the
[time=2735] word means to settle for a brief period of time not permanently not for good it means to settle
[time=2744] for a brief period of time alongside unbelievers
[time=2750] god says you and i are aliens and strangers called to settle for a brief period of time
[time=2760] alongside others for the sake of being a people who would be distinct and different
[time=2769] and a representation of his character his presence these new christians had found themselves totally surrounded by non-believers and since
[time=2781] that is where they lived and it is most certainly where you and i live they understood as do you
[time=2788] and i that they were being watched so what is it that peter wanted these christians to do
[time=2794] what would what would salvage their distinctiveness what would salvage the credibility of the church
[time=2802] peter calls them to full surrender and he breaks it down into two very important parts
[time=2809] number one we finally made it to number one write this down we were to live fully surrendered privately that's right if you and i are to live fully surrendered lives we must realize that
[time=2819] initially this begins internally we are to live fully surrendered lives privately we have been asked to what's the text say we have been asked to abstain from sinful desires
[time=2833] which wage war against your soul literally there in the greek we are to hold ourselves back from
[time=2842] you and i energized by the spirit of god supported by the people of god taught by the word of god
[time=2849] we are to hold ourselves back from these types of desires and activities in some texts you'll see
[time=2858] the word lusts which means any sinful cravings or strong desires you want to just a quick practical
[time=2867] rendering go to Galatians five go ahead go back to Galatians five Galatians five um 19
[time=2881] Galatians five 19 you see it not in its not in its total not in its totality is it all
[time=2893] laid out here but i tell you what it's a pretty decent list of what it looks like these sins of the flesh this this lustful desire and all the many different places that it leads
[time=2906] says in verse 19 of Galatians five now the deeds of the flesh are evident which are immorality impurity sensuality idolatry sorcery enmities strife jealousy outbursts of anger
[time=2921] disputes dissensions factions envying drunkenness carousing and things like these
[time=2928] of which i forewarn you just as i have forewarned you that those who practice those whose lives are marked by those who show a hard-hearted and progressive pattern of
[time=2940] that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of god
[time=2949] deeds of the flesh followed by the fruit of the spirit and you can read that in 22 on down he says you and i are to abstain my friends watch this interesting to study this
[time=2963] and think this through this week stay with me here he says watch this he says you and i are to abstain first peter five eight you can write that down if you want to first peter five
[time=2975] eight says that we are we are to stay sober we are to be sober in our approach to these things
[time=2982] see i love the here's where i'm going with this i love the balance in scripture of this endeavor
[time=2989] you know what my friends we play a role here in this call to abstain we play a role the word
[time=2997] itself abstain the definition of it gives gives credit to the idea that there is an enormous part that you and i play in this choices have to be made but you know what so does god
[time=3008] so does god he also plays a role paul says uh we're to work out our salvation we're
[time=3016] we're to work out our salvation and fear and trembling he says in roman six you can write that down he says in roman six that it's up to us that we are to stop presenting our bodies as
[time=3029] instruments of sin says in colossians three that we are to we are to put aside the deeds of darkness
[time=3038] and the author of hebrews says that we are to you and i are to strip away and lay aside
[time=3044] every sin and every encumbrance everything that might even lead to sin
[time=3050] there are choices for you to make today there are decisions for you and i to make tomorrow
[time=3057] there is a part in this endeavor where he looks at you and i and says you are going to have to choose
[time=3064] and you may have to go to links that you didn't used to have to go to you may have to ask for levels
[time=3070] of help that you didn't think you really needed you may have to posture yourself at a level of
[time=3076] vulnerability that that maybe before you were afraid of but you know what you're going to have to do some things here you're going to have to get up off your tail make a phone call
[time=3088] send an email ask for some help put a plan together have it be an aggressive one because he's coming
[time=3095] after you there's a part in this where you and i have to do and then you know what i'm so grateful
[time=3108] for david i'm so grateful for the songs because you know what i can you can sit down like i did
[time=3114] yesterday and start to read through the songs and you can read things like oh god rescue me amen rescue me from my sin deliver me you god not me you deliver me from my sin keep me from my sin
[time=3134] david says strengthen me from my god please david cries to god please take it away from me
[time=3141] there's a role that you play and there is a role that he plays and you know what i am so grateful
[time=3149] for james write this down james four seven to ten because as is always the case my friends
