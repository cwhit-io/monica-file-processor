[time=249] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I am so thankful that you've joined us again for the broadcast.
[time=256] You know, oftentimes I'll say to you, and oftentimes you'll hear from us, how thankful we are and how excited we are as we get to seek God at work in the lives of people.
[time=267] And I see it everywhere.
[time=268] I am so grateful for what I see happening with young children, for instance.
[time=273] I see him at work in our children's ministry.
[time=276] I see him changing lives in our students.
[time=278] I see young adults becoming more and more hungry for the Word of God, young adults beginning to actually make changes in their lives as they seek to follow him more faithfully.
[time=290] I see moms and dads and senior adults.
[time=293] I see it across the board.
[time=295] But one of the arenas where I find myself most encouraged these days is watching God continue to work through Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=304] We are so thankful for our school, so thankful for the years that God has given us.
[time=309] And in the last couple of years, Dr. Sam Barfill, who has joined me today, Sam has come and joined our team.
[time=316] Sam gives leadership to all of our school effort.
[time=319] And as Sam and I work together, I continue to be so thankful for what God does in the hearts and lives of students and families alike.
[time=327] And these are exciting days at Black Hawk Christian.
[time=330] And I wanted Sam to give you kind of an insight into what God's doing in his heart, give you an insight into our school and its ministry, and Sam share with the people the things that you're encouraged by share with them, the opportunities we see God giving in our ministry through the school.
[time=348] And thank you so much for being here today.
[time=350] Thanks, Kelly.
[time=351] It sure is a joy to be a part of the ministry of Black Hawk Ministries and particularly in leading the ministry of Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=358] I've been so encouraged in the two years that God has allowed me and my family to be here and just seeing how God's working in this ministry, in this place.
[time=365] You know, as leader of a school.
[time=368] I do a lot of reading and a lot of thinking about our role.
[time=371] Came across this the other day.
[time=373] A comment made by a leader in North America of Christian school education.
[time=378] And here's what he said.
[time=379] I thought this was interesting.
[time=380] I want to share it with you today.
[time=381] He said, "All that can be discovered, studied, fathomed, all that can be created, adored or enjoyed, existed first in the mind of God, is sustained by Christ's power and is revealed through the Holy Spirit's presence." And as I reflected on that and thought about that, in terms of our role as a Christian school, I was just so amazed that the opportunity God has given us to do that very thing in the hearts and lives and minds of about 765 students in preschool, elementary, junior high, and high school.
[time=414] And that sobered me, the thought that we have the responsibility to partner with parents to train the hearts and the minds of these young people was a sobering and staggering thought.
[time=426] But yet it is our responsibility as a Christian school, and I can't think of anything more effective than training young hearts and young minds to love God with all their heart, mind and soul and to teach them how to think in a way which is biblical, which is Christian.
[time=440] All in the context of a quality education, all the reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[time=444] And I just want to take this opportunity today to invite you to explore the possibility for you and your family to be a part of the great family of Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=453] And we still do have openings in some of our elementary grades and some of our middle school grades and just a few openings in our high school.
[time=460] We have openings in our preschool as well, and I want to challenge you and encourage you to explore that possibility.
[time=465] Would you give us a call today and let us invite you here?
[time=468] We'll set an appointment. We'll give you what we call the tour and the talk.
[time=472] We'll walk you through this place, let you see all of the hearts and faces of the kids who are part of Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=478] I'll let you see and meet the great faculty that God has led here.
[time=481] And all that to just to see if our hearts could be knitted together in such a way that you would want to partner with us with your children and training them in the ways of the Lord.
[time=491] And so I invite you to do that.
[time=493] Give us a call at the church number, and we'll get your call directed to the right place, either preschool or elementary or middle school or high school, and one of our principals would love to walk you through.
[time=502] I'd like the opportunity to meet you and pray with you about that decision, and I invite you to do that.
[time=507] And thanks so much for letting me share that opportunity with you today.
[time=527] [MUSIC - 56 seconds]
[time=586] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] They wonder why? [MUSIC] Do we do the things we do? [MUSIC] â™ª
[time=608] Well, hey, let me invite you, if you would, to open your Bibles to 1 Peter chapter 2.
[time=612] We're going to go back this morning to where we were last week.
[time=615] We made our way through about half of what was there in verse 11.
[time=619] Our passage this morning is 1 Peter chapter 2 verses 11 and 12.
[time=624] We've entitled it the Fundamentals of Full Surrender.
[time=628] The Fundamentals of Full Surrender.
[time=630] We see in verse 11 and verse 12 two very important components, two vital parts of this biblical notion of a fully devoted, fully surrendered life.
[time=641] And I want to just ask if you would, in honor of God's Word, would you stand with me this morning and allow me to read for you again our text, 1 Peter chapter 2 verses 11 and 12.
[time=652] Peter writes there, "Beloved, I urge you, as aliens and strangers, to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
[time=662] Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers, may because of your good deeds as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation." Let me pray for you, if I can.
[time=680] Father God, we gather today and we stand here this morning in this room with humble hearts,
[time=686] so grateful that you love us, so thankful that you sent your son to die on our behalf
[time=692] and so very appreciative God that in that process we were given access.
[time=697] God, we were given a relationship with you.
[time=701] And God and those of us that know you in the room this morning, we know that that relationship with you comes under attack every day.
[time=710] God, we know that there is one out there who would want to destroy and weaken and diminish, not only our own hearts and lives and our own testimonies, but God, even the ministry of your church, your bride, the bride that you love so dearly and gave up so much for.
[time=726] And so as we attempt to be individually God fully surrendered in our hearts on a daily basis, and God, as we long to be a community of Christ followers, a church God of fully surrendered believers, we pray, God, that the things that we would see today, the things, God, that your word would have for us, God, that we would be humble, that we would be submissive in our spirit, God, that we would be teachable, God, that we would allow the Spirit of God and the Word of God to reach deep into our souls and hearts and lives.
[time=759] God, continue to mold and shape us into the people that you long for us to be.
[time=763] And thank you so very much for the privilege of being together here in this place this morning and all the people agreed and said, "Amen, you can be seated." Well, last week we entitled our message, "The Fundamentals of Full Surrender."
[time=779] And we kind of basically just got through verse 11.
[time=782] We initiated our study last week by talking about the fact that God's word is very clear that there are two components to this issue of being a fully surrendered follower of Christ.
[time=794] We talked about how, on the one hand, full surrender takes place at that point in time when you and I bowed the knee of our heart when we came to that place of realization that our sin
[time=805] separated us from God, and it may have been in your car, it might have been on the floor by your bed, it could have been in a church service like this, it might have been at camp, it could have been with your mother or your father, but there was a point in time when we fully surrendered our hearts and lives to Him.
[time=824] We said, "I am completely yours, and I accept the gift of your Son, His death on my behalf, and I now enter into this life-changing relationship with you." There's a point of full surrender,
[time=835] it's called salvation.
[time=837] And then we talked about how from that very point on God takes us down a road, He moves us along in this spiritual journey called sanctification.
[time=846] It's where He makes you and He makes me, He works in us and around us, and He begins to make us more and more like Him, it's called sanctification.
[time=855] And it is a daily, moment by moment process, where God is at work, Philippians 1, 6, He is perfecting us, He is completing in you and I, that which He began at the point of salvation.
[time=867] And we agreed last week, I believe most of us did at least, that as you and I travel along this road of sanctification, as you and I make our way through this life, this relationship, this ongoing day by day journey with Him, there are times when we come under attack, there are times when the enemy and all that He feels and all that He wants to see transpire,
[time=890] all the things that He hates about truth, all the stuff that He despises about God.
[time=895] He brings all of that energy and all of that effort and tries to focus His temptation and tries to bring His discouragement, He aims at all at you and me.
[time=905] And the attack is constant, He is crafty, He is industrious, He is creative,
[time=914] He leaves no stone unturned, He is relentless, and He will do anything and everything within His power,
[time=923] as the quote said last week, to see to it that you and I and our hearts and our souls and our relationships in this place and kingdom work gets diminished, squelched and ruined.
[time=936] That's His posture. We talked about that last week.
[time=940] And so we asked the question, the passage kind of begs the question, what will your posture be then?
[time=948] So how are you going to respond to this kind of moment by moment almost attack?
[time=954] How are you and I going to position and posture ourselves in our everyday relationship with Christ in such a way that we could not only withstand the fiery darts, not only withstand the bombs that He throws your way in mind, but move through them
[time=969] in God-honoring fashion, in victory, in strength, in confidence.
[time=975] And the answer is clearly stated here in our passage, it's a fully surrendered.
[time=979] It's a fully devoted. It's a fully surrendered heart and life.
[time=984] Number one, it's important that you and I would understand that at the beginning of this endeavor, as we face all that comes our way, you and I would need to, number one, be fully surrendered privately. Write that down. Would you fully surrendered privately?
[time=998] Why do I say privately? Well, the text kind of gives notion to that.
[time=1003] Beloved, I urge you, verse 11. Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers.
[time=1007] Again, this place is not our home. We long for a day where there will be a better place, a place called home, a place called heaven. Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain, He says, from fleshly lusts which wage war against the what?
[time=1025] Say it louder. This battle that He brings, this war that He is waging is against you at the soul level.
[time=1034] Way down deep inside where you think what you think and you imagine what you imagine.
[time=1041] And your fantasy takes you wherever it takes you and your thoughts go wherever they might go.
[time=1048] At the very core of who you are, at the level of your soul, He is waging war against you in the private recesses of your mind.
[time=1062] And God's word says that we are to abstain.
[time=1067] You see that word there? That we are to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
[time=1074] We talked about this last week. Abstain means to a whole interesting powerful word.
[time=1079] It means to hold oneself back to refuse.
[time=1083] The word carries with it the notion of a refusal on your part.
[time=1088] The balance between you and Him. It's a refusal on your part in mind to take one step more.
[time=1097] And you understand as I understand how challenging that can be at times.
[time=1103] Don't you? You and I both understand the reality of just walking along, right?
[time=1109] I mean it's how it happens oftentimes with me. I'm just walking along through my day.
[time=1115] You with me? I've had a good morning. I've started the day right.
[time=1120] I've got good desires going. I've got a good plan in front of me, right?
[time=1126] I'm not looking for trouble. I'm not trying to get out of bounds. You with me?
[time=1130] I'm not purposely trying to, you know, snap hook this day into the bushes.
[time=1135] I'm trying to just move right down the middle.
[time=1139] And He just, you've been there having you. And He just, wham, right there.
[time=1147] You've been there? I've got to know where. Like where did that come from?
[time=1152] Or where did this trans, I mean He just, boom, right there.
[time=1158] What are you going to do? What are you going to do?
[time=1163] How will you in that moment be great if He gave you a day, right?
[time=1167] But He doesn't give you an eye a day. He gives us an instant.
[time=1170] He gives us a moment. And God's Word says in those moments, you and I are to by the spirit and power of God, abstain.
[time=1178] We are to hold ourselves back to refuse to take one more step, turn away and go in a different direction. It's a word which has the beginnings of repentance.
[time=1189] And all of this takes place where? First of all, initially it all takes place where?
[time=1195] Right there. That's why I love what it says in Philippians 4.
[time=1199] You can turn there, you can read on the screen. It says in Philippians 4 verses 8 and 9.
[time=1207] Philippians 4 verses 8 and 9, it says finally, brethren, listen.
[time=1211] Whatever is true, whatever is, and I want you to think about this.
[time=1216] This might seem like a lot, okay, but in the moment, in the instant,
[time=1222] yes, in the morning, as you and I prepare for the moment.
[time=1226] But see, even in the moment, it's the opportunity for you and I to, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence, and if anything worthy of praise, what?
[time=1245] Say it again. Put your finger on your forehead like this.
[time=1251] Say it again. Dwell on these things.
[time=1255] Think about the word dwell there and the Greek has to do with pondering.
[time=1259] It has to do with staying there. You with me?
[time=1263] Just settle in there on those things.
[time=1268] True things, right things, pure things, honorable things.
[time=1274] And there is so much garbage out there.
[time=1280] And the whole purpose that the enemy has is for you and I to dwell on, stay, settle in on that stuff.
[time=1288] Because he knows, and I know, and you know, where the dwelling, where the dwelling leads to.
[time=1296] Sometimes we don't get to verse 9, but look at verse 9.
[time=1300] The things you have heard, all these true, good, honorable, pure, excellent things, the things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me.
[time=1308] What? Practice these things.
[time=1313] Dwelling on things leads to whatting, practicing what you dwell on,
[time=1319] what we think about inevitably is where we go and what we do.
[time=1324] Practice these things and the God of peace will be with you.
[time=1330] Number one question for you and me in this culture, I believe, today.
[time=1334] The number one question for any Christ follower today.
[time=1338] I don't care if you're 12, 25, 38, 52, 67.
[time=1343] I don't care where you are on the continuum.
[time=1346] I believe today, as we see the strategy of the enemy, I believe the question for Christ followers today is, will you abstain?
[time=1358] Will you abstain from the fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul?
[time=1363] And don't forget that though there is a direct connotation here with the moral arena when he talks about fleshly lusts, the lust which wage war against your soul is not just the stuff on the computer, it's not just the stuff on the screen, it's not just the stuff in the magazines, this is not just the stuff of illicit relationships.
[time=1384] No, this is about money as well.
[time=1387] This is about any lust, any craving that you and I would have that moves us outside the arena of that which God has provided.
[time=1398] And he is in those arenas waging war against your soul because he wants you outside the arena of what God has provided.
[time=1407] It is a war, it is a fight for your mind and soul, and so you and I need to be first of all fully surrendered privately.
[time=1416] And I hope that you've got people in your life who you talk with about the private parts of your world.
[time=1424] I hope there are friends that come alongside you and you them, and I hope there are daily, regular discussions about the private part of your world.
[time=1436] That's where the war has been waged initially.
[time=1441] Then there must be verse 12, we didn't get to this last week, let's move there today.
[time=1445] Then there is fully surrendered publicly.
[time=1449] The opportunity you and I have to having privately given ourselves completely to him, we then look at a public outer life, a fully surrendered life.
[time=1460] And I love the passage, look what it says, "The behavior having abstained from the fleshly lust which waged war against the soul." He says, "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers, they may because of your good deeds as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation." You know, I love this passage.
[time=1485] I love this passage for a lot of reasons.
[time=1488] There are a number of teaching points here as we make our way through these two verses, but one of the things I love most about this passage is that it gives us yet another look into the redemptive heart of God.
[time=1502] This is really about evangelism here, my friends.
[time=1506] This is really about the opportunity you and I have to live life in relationship with him in such a way that he brings others to himself.
[time=1517] I want to start with, we don't usually do this.
[time=1519] I want to start at the end of the verse, and then kind of work our way back to kind of give you the full scope and I think a real powerful view of what he's doing here.
[time=1528] Go to the end of the verse where it says that because of your good deeds as they observe them, you know, keep your behavior excellent, and because of your good deeds as they observe them, they might be able to glorify God, it says, in the day of visitation, interesting phrase, very interesting concept.
[time=1548] Underline that, I'll write that in your notes.
[time=1550] The day of visitation, what is it that Peter's referring to here?
[time=1554] What is this about?
[time=1555] Well, the day of visitation is an Old Testament concept.
[time=1561] It's where we first see it in the Scriptures.
[time=1564] It's an Old Testament concept referring to occasions when God would visit mankind, and God would visit mankind with either a blessing or a judgment.
[time=1575] This would be the pattern in the Old Testament.
[time=1580] God visiting mankind with either a judgment or a blessing.
[time=1585] The prophet Isaiah wrote of divine visitation for the purpose of judgment, he writes in Isaiah 10.
[time=1592] And what will you do, Isaiah prophesied, and what will you do in the day of visitation?
[time=1598] And in the desolation which shall come from afar, to whom will you flee for help?
[time=1603] And where will you leave your glory?
[time=1606] On the other hand, Exodus chapter 3 tells of God's visitation to announce Israel's eventual deliverance from Egypt, which would be a blessing for his people.
[time=1617] Jeremiah as well prophesied God's visitation to deliver the Jews from Babylon.
[time=1623] Jeremiah says, in Jeremiah 29, for thus says the Lord, when 70 years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill my good word to you to bring you back to this place.
[time=1637] Many, many references and instances in the Old Testament of this day of visitation.
[time=1643] And in that context, it was either blessing or judgment, blessing or judgment.
[time=1646] Now as you move to the New Testament, the idea of the visitation, the day of visitation indicates blessing and redemption, a slight shift.
[time=1655] Now it's predominantly just referring to blessing and redemption or redemption or salvation.
[time=1662] In the immediate aftermath of John the Baptist's birth, his father Zacharias prophesied, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited us and accomplished redemption for his people." On the other hand, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, Jesus said in Luke 19, Jesus said, "They will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation."
[time=1700] Because the Jews rejected Christ's visitation of salvation, it turned to a visitation of judgment.
[time=1707] Well, in our passage here today, it's God's redemption that is clearly and powerfully stated in Peter's reference to the day of visitation.
[time=1719] The Apostle used the expression to show that because of the observation of God-honoring behavior, because those far from God were observing, would have the opportunity to observe God-honoring behavior by faithful followers of Christ.
[time=1736] They would be privileged back to the text, last line.
[time=1740] They would be privileged to glorify God when he visited them with salvation.
[time=1747] You see it there?
[time=1749] What a great privilege, what a great opportunity.
[time=1752] And you go back now to the beginning of the verse, and you ask yourself the question, "What can bring about redemption?" I mean, in the part that God allows us to play, what is it that can help bring about redemption and salvation in the life of one far from God?
[time=1768] Your excellent what?
[time=1770] Say it, behavior.
[time=1773] It is your excellent behavior.
[time=1777] Now, that word is noble.
[time=1779] That word is lovely.
[time=1780] That word is gracious.
[time=1781] That word is consistent and kind.
[time=1783] These are words connected to that word in the original language.
[time=1787] It is your excellent, noble, lovely, gracious, kind, consistent behavior among the Gentiles.
[time=1795] One way of looking at it is just take verse 11 and verse 12 and just say it's when you're abstaining, it's when you're abstaining at the soul level, turns into moves into obedient living.
[time=1808] It's when you're abstaining, turns into obedience.
[time=1811] And it is your obedience and your behavior that leads them to the realization of who God is.
[time=1819] When you and I abstain, when we fight back, when we choose obedience over compromise, when we are faithful and not fleshly, when we dwell on, when we dwell on and then do these things.
[time=1834] He uses that to influence others in miraculous life-changing ways.
[time=1840] I want to take you back to an example of this right from the very pages of Scripture.
[time=1844] Go back in your Old Testament if you would to Daniel.
[time=1846] Would you?
[time=1847] Go back to Daniel chapter 6.
[time=1849] And before the passage itself comes on the screen, I want to just kind of catch you up on what has transpired here in Daniel 6.
[time=1856] What an amazing story.
[time=1857] Not only in chapter 6, the whole book.
[time=1859] Most of you in the room know that Daniel, as a young boy, is kidnapped and taken away from his home.
[time=1865] He is a Jewish young man and he and his friends, Shadrach, Meshach and Amendigo are taken away by Nebuchadnezzar, this crazed wacko dictator who's going to just rule the world and he takes the boys 1500 miles away from home to Babylon, puts them in essence in prison, and yet they stand firm in their faith.
[time=1885] These young boys ate what they were supposed to eat as young Jewish men.
[time=1890] They kept the tradition.
[time=1892] They kept the daily disciplines of all that they had been taught, even in the presence of Nebuchadnezzar, who was a murderer and who was crazed and a lunatic, and they knew it.
[time=1905] They stood strong.
[time=1906] They lived out their faith.
[time=1908] They found favor.
[time=1909] We go through the whole fiery furnace or ordeal in Daniel 3.
[time=1913] Again, their faithfulness and their conviction and their willingness to behave excellently is honored.
[time=1922] No compromise, no turning away.
[time=1924] They abstain and they live excellently.
[time=1929] And now we come later in the story of Daniel 6.
[time=1932] We're Daniel again.
[time=1933] He's a little bit older now.
[time=1934] He's found more favor now, not with Nebuchadnezzar, but with a king called Darius.
[time=1939] And Darius has so favored Daniel that he has given Daniel responsibility, governmental responsibility in the kingdom.
[time=1946] And there are those who are jealous of Daniel.
[time=1948] And so some of the folks around Darius and their jealousy move behind the scenes to trap Daniel.
[time=1955] And they convince Darius the king to invoke a law, a new decree that would state that no one could pray to any other God, but Darius himself.
[time=1967] And they knew Daniel.
[time=1968] They knew he prayed daily.
[time=1969] They knew he prayed often to his God.
[time=1972] And in their jealousy and hatred, they convince Darius to pass the law.
[time=1976] Darius passes the law.
[time=1977] Daniel hears about the law.
[time=1979] And Daniel goes and prays.
[time=1982] They catch Daniel in the act.
[time=1985] These jealous, conniving enemies that had connived against him.
[time=1990] And they bring Daniel to Darius and they say we caught him praying.
[time=1993] And he wasn't praying to you.
[time=1995] And so Darius is stuck.
[time=1996] He hates what has happened.
[time=1997] He sees what they've done, but he has no choice.
[time=1999] The law must be enforced.
[time=2001] And so Daniel is thrown in the lion's den.
[time=2004] A little backdrop for you there.
[time=2006] Daniel and the lion's den.
[time=2008] And you'll remember that Daniel's thrown into the den of lions.
[time=2012] They seal it.
[time=2013] And Darius doesn't go to sleep.
[time=2016] Doesn't sleep all night.
[time=2018] Comes back in the morning and by the power and might of God, Daniel had been protected.
[time=2023] The lion's mouths had been shut.
[time=2025] Darius yells in.
[time=2026] Daniel says I'm fine.
[time=2028] Darius says Daniel removed.
[time=2030] Has all the guys that did this thrown in.
[time=2033] And you get the impression the lion's mouths weren't shut at that point.
[time=2039] And then I want you to read.
[time=2041] I want you to read what Darius says, verse 25.
[time=2044] Then Darius the king.
[time=2046] Here we have a young man who had abstained.
[time=2049] Here we have a young man who had lived and chose an excellent behavior.
[time=2053] Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples.
[time=2055] Nations and men of every language who were living in all the land.
[time=2062] May your peace abound.
[time=2063] I make a decree.
[time=2064] Here's a degree for you.
[time=2065] I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom, men are to fear and tremble before the what?
[time=2073] The God of Daniel.
[time=2075] For he is the what?
[time=2077] For he is the living God and enduring forever.
[time=2080] And his kingdom is one which will not be destroyed.
[time=2083] And his dominion will be forever.
[time=2085] He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders in heaven and on earth.
[time=2089] Who has also delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
[time=2093] And so this Daniel, verse 28, enjoyed success in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
[time=2100] You know what my friends?
[time=2102] You're abstaining today.
[time=2105] And your excellent behavior, it may not lead to a decree by the king.
[time=2113] But it very well may lead to a friend or neighbor of yours, a co-worker of yours, a family member of yours,
[time=2125] coming to life-changing, eternity-altering faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2132] That's how God does it.
[time=2134] Time and time and time again.
[time=2137] And he says abstaining, fight this war, live excellently so that when the day of visitation comes,
[time=2145] that individual can praise God and bring glory to God and think you and I get to be a part of that process.
[time=2155] Now Daniel and Darius and this relationship between a believer and a government official,
[time=2162] it's a great segue into our next passage.
[time=2165] And we're going to jump into that passage today.
[time=2167] But before we do that, I'm going to sit down and our stage-like drama team has prepared just kind of an everyday,
[time=2174] in a sense, kind of humorous look into this issue of leadership.
[time=2177] Because you know what?
[time=2178] As we transition to this idea of you and I following leaders who have been placed over us sometimes,
[time=2185] sometimes you and I know that we get to do that with leaders that are really, really good leaders.
[time=2190] And sometimes we find ourselves having to think about it and work it through with folks who aren't such good leaders.
[time=2196] Either way, there's lots for you and I to consider, so sit back and just kind of take in the leadership style of our pastor, Howitzer.
[time=2206] Sir, your three o'clock appointment is here, sir.
[time=2215] Oh, hello, I'm Reverend Howitzer.
[time=2219] Yes, we met after the Sunday service.
[time=2221] Right, come on in, comments, right?
[time=2224] You have a good memory. Well, I'm Dave and this is my wife Penny.
[time=2227] Dave and Penny, of course, would you care for some coffee?
[time=2230] Yes, that would be nice.
[time=2231] You and us?
[time=2232] Sir, right away, sir.
[time=2234] Would you like cream or sugar?
[time=2236] A little cream, please.
[time=2237] Okay, I'll be right back.
[time=2242] Let me tell you, the secret to a well-run church is a top-notch secretary.
[time=2247] I bet.
[time=2248] Now, if I could just find one.
[time=2251] That's a joke.
[time=2254] You folks get out much? Have a seat.
[time=2256] Sorry, we're just a little nervous being new in town and all.
[time=2259] That's right, you did mention that.
[time=2262] Well, we were hoping that you would consider us as your new church home.
[time=2265] Well, actually, we just started looking.
[time=2267] Oh, that's good, that's good.
[time=2269] Well, we do have some questions, which is why we came by.
[time=2272] Well, fire away, figuratively speaking, that is.
[time=2276] Well, first of all, we wanted to ask you about the basic beliefs of the church, where you stand, doctrine, that sort of thing.
[time=2284] Well, that's easy. We just followed the book.
[time=2286] Oh, good. We were hoping this was a Bible-based church.
[time=2289] Well, we used the Bible, too.
[time=2291] To?
[time=2292] Well, yes, Bible book is based on the Bible.
[time=2296] See, I felt the need to spell out a few things to my people, so they would have a clear perspective on how we operate.
[time=2303] What book are you talking about?
[time=2305] Oh, this book.
[time=2309] A guidebook to Living for Members of the Army of God Church, or Straight Shooting from Pastor Howitzer.
[time=2316] Yes, at the play on my name was my wife's suggestion.
[time=2320] So, this is like your membership manual?
[time=2324] The living manual. It covers everything.
[time=2327] No sense having people wandering around in the dark wondering what to do.
[time=2331] But you base everything on the Bible.
[time=2333] Well, of course, the Bible's the Word of God.
[time=2335] Right. We believe that, too.
[time=2337] And since God put me over this church, and God's Word says to submit to your leaders,
[time=2343] what I say goes.
[time=2346] So, I wrote the book.
[time=2348] We'll have to look it over.
[time=2350] Well, I'll get you a copy.
[time=2357] Tell me about the name of the church, Army of God.
[time=2359] Is that a denomination?
[time=2361] Oh, we're an independent congregation.
[time=2364] I came up with the name, has a nice authority ring to it, doesn't it?
[time=2368] When I first came here, they had this ridiculous name of "family fellowship community church."
[time=2375] You didn't like that name?
[time=2377] Oh, it's so mushy.
[time=2379] It sounds like a playground with a steeple.
[time=2382] How do you get people to follow God's calling when all they're thinking about is fellowship and family and community?
[time=2391] I believe that God, once my people, committed to the core.
[time=2395] Therefore, the Army of God.
[time=2399] Army of God.
[time=2401] It's like when you say, "Moo-fasa!
[time=2405] Moo-fasa!" Oh, I'm going to say it again.
[time=2409] Moo-fasa!
[time=2411] Oh, yes, Army of God, yeah.
[time=2415] Um, okay.
[time=2417] Well, maybe you could tell us a little bit about how the church is run.
[time=2421] Do you have a board of elders or deacons or what?
[time=2425] Well, over here I'll show you our chart here.
[time=2437] As you can see, we believe in the polarity of followership.
[time=2441] No one person should be responsible for following my orders.
[time=2446] That power should be evenly distributed among everybody else.
[time=2451] Really?
[time=2453] Well, we've been doing a little restructuring.
[time=2457] And I think this reflects my vision more clearly.
[time=2461] Yeah.
[time=2462] Uh, here we go.
[time=2465] I have your coffee for you.
[time=2467] Oh, no.
[time=2468] What?
[time=2469] I forgot your cream.
[time=2470] Oh, dear.
[time=2471] You what?
[time=2472] Drop and give me ten, soldier.
[time=2474] No.
[time=2475] Sir, yes, sir.
[time=2476] It's okay.
[time=2477] I can drink a black.
[time=2478] Oh, you're too generous.
[time=2480] Three.
[time=2481] She needs to learn to follow orders.
[time=2483] Do you always treat people like this?
[time=2485] Oh, I know what you're thinking.
[time=2487] Boy, is he a softie.
[time=2489] I want to tell you, she's been with me 17 years and she's still out of shape.
[time=2494] Sir, thank you, sir.
[time=2496] May I have another, sir.
[time=2497] Oh, forget it, Eunice, just go get the cream.
[time=2500] Sir, yes, sir.
[time=2501] Dismissed.
[time=2502] Sir.
[time=2503] You know, I'm not so sure we'd fit in around here.
[time=2506] Oh, don't worry about it.
[time=2508] We have lots of green recruits.
[time=2510] They just stick around here long enough.
[time=2512] We whip them into top spiritual shape.
[time=2515] You'd be surprised at the unity I enjoy here.
[time=2518] Well, surely some have objected.
[time=2521] Well, there's been a few that have disagreed with what God is doing through my leadership.
[time=2527] And what happened to them?
[time=2529] If I tell you, I have to kill you.
[time=2531] Come on, Dave, we need to get home to the sitter.
[time=2534] But we don't have any time left.
[time=2536] Sorry, you got to go.
[time=2538] Nice talking to Pastor General or Pastor?
[time=2540] Well, you come see us again.
[time=2542] They've gone already?
[time=2544] And I don't think they'll be back.
[time=2546] Another couple gone, just like that.
[time=2549] Oh, don't worry about it, Eunice.
[time=2552] All we need is some sheep sneaking in here, spoiling the purity of my flock.
[time=2559] Well, as I mentioned, there are good leaders and there are bad ones.
[time=2563] And you and I, whether we're talking about the church or whether we're talking about society, whether we're talking about government, whether we're talking about city, or wherever you and I go, we are going to have to learn to deal with those in authority.
[time=2581] And so as we make our way to this next passage in our ongoing study, we come to verses 13 through 17, which speaks in a powerful way to this very issue.
[time=2591] Listen to what it says.
[time=2593] It says, "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution,
[time=2599] but to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him, for the punishment of evil doers and the praise of those who do right.
[time=2608] For such is the will of God, that by doing right, you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.
[time=2614] Act, verse 16, as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bond slaves of God.
[time=2622] Honor all people.
[time=2624] Love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king."
[time=2630] This fully surrendered followers of Christ as redeemed children of God,
[time=2636] Scripture teaches that our true allegiance, our true home, the Bible is very clear
[time=2642] that our citizenship as followers of Christ is in where?
[time=2647] Say it louder.
[time=2649] Heaven, that's right.
[time=2651] God's Word's really clear that when it gets right down to the bottom line, our allegiance, our citizenship, our home is in heaven.
[time=2660] A clear message of the Word of God, we just saw it back in verse 11, is that we're aliens, it says.
[time=2666] We're strangers here on earth living in, as it says in Hebrews, living in tents with bags packed, looking forward to a day when we will finally be home.
[time=2676] As citizens of heaven, Christ followers are to submit completely to God's divine authority.
[time=2684] Now watch this.
[time=2685] We are to submit completely to God's divine authority in each and every form
[time=2692] that that divine authority takes.
[time=2696] And as true and as right as that principle is, there is always the potential for danger
[time=2703] as people like you and I misapply that truth.
[time=2707] What do I mean?
[time=2708] Well, believers can at times, and you've seen it, and I have seen it.
[time=2713] Believers can at times become indifferent, agitated, and even disdainful toward that authority when it comes in the form of the governmental
[time=2723] political, civil, or institutional authorities that govern and lead us in the everyday of life.
[time=2730] You see the convictions, you've seen it and I've seen it.
[time=2732] The convictions of zealous Christ followers can at times clash with the governmental
[time=2739] powers, and there is that potential that in the clash, or in the revolt, or in the
[time=2745] uprising, or in the petitions, or in the sit-ins, there is the potential.
[time=2751] Peter speaks to it here, and it's on the heart of God, and I love where it leads.
[time=2755] It leads right back to the redemptive heart of God.
[time=2758] It leads right back to evangelism.
[time=2761] See, because there's the potential that when zealous Christ follower comes up against governmental authority, that the testimony and potential influence that
[time=2772] that believer could have had is at times lost or greatly diminished by the lack
[time=2778] of submission, the lack of respect, and the lack of compliance.
[time=2782] Our passage today, and a passage that we'll be in for, I'm sure, a couple of weeks, teaches us that love for God and citizenship and heaven must be balanced by a proper
[time=2794] respect for and humble submission to all legitimate institutions of human
[time=2801] authority, and the civil, and the social, and the spiritual implications in this
[time=2808] passage are just huge.
[time=2810] Let's just jump in.
[time=2811] Can we number one write this down?
[time=2812] The first thing you see, and the first thing I see in this passage regarding our Christian submission to authority, is the command.
[time=2822] Write that down.
[time=2823] The first thing you see very blatantly and very clearly right there at the beginning of verse 13 is the command for submission.
[time=2831] It says, "Submit yourselves.
[time=2834] Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution."
[time=2841] Now, think with me on this.
[time=2843] You and I know that, and we just said it, "Although ultimately in the end, we are not under human authority." We see here in our text that God still expects and requires believers to submit
[time=2855] to the human government or institutions that He has ordained.
[time=2860] Now, the word submit there.
[time=2861] You can write this down.
[time=2862] The word submit, the word in the Greek is "hupostaso," and it is a military term which meant to arrange information under the commander.
[time=2872] To arrange in proper formation under the commander.
[time=2876] And we find this principle of submitting to authority at work even all the way back
[time=2882] in the Old Testament.
[time=2883] If you're taking notes, write this down.
[time=2885] Deuteronomy 17, 14 through 15.
[time=2891] 1 Samuel 10, 24.
[time=2895] 1 Chronicles 29, 24.
[time=2898] Look those up later.
[time=2899] There you'll see more evidence given of this idea of biblical submission to the authorities that God has placed.
[time=2906] But I want to take you to Proverbs 24.
[time=2909] It says in Proverbs 24, 21.
[time=2911] You can turn there or look on the screen.
[time=2914] Proverbs 24, verse 21.
[time=2917] David gives some words of wisdom as he speaks here in the 24th chapter.
[time=2922] He says in verse 21, "My son, fear the Lord and the King.
[time=2927] Fear show great respect for.
[time=2930] Conduct yourself respectfully as you submit to.
[time=2934] Fear the Lord and the King." Do not associate David says with those who are given to change in the Hebrew there, the idea of those given to change, those would be those leading the uprising.
[time=2947] That would be those who would be instigating the revolt.
[time=2950] This would be those who would be living disrespectfully and without submission
[time=2956] to the King.
[time=2957] He says, "Stay a long, long way away from those folks." Why?
[time=2962] For their calamity, verse 22.
[time=2964] For their calamity will rise suddenly.
[time=2966] And who knows the ruin that comes from both of them?
[time=2971] People, here's a fundamental point for you this morning as we start this passage.
[time=2975] Fundamental point to keep in mind.
[time=2978] Submission to rulers, write this down.
[time=2980] Submission to rulers is right because God appoints rulers.
[time=2988] Do you understand that?
[time=2989] Do you realize that?
[time=2991] There isn't a ruler alive.
[time=2993] There isn't a leader in office.
[time=2996] There is nowhere on this earth, anyone exercising authority that God didn't allow in.
[time=3007] Let's chew on that for a second and turn to Romans 13.
[time=3011] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, go to Romans 13.
[time=3017] Romans 13, 1 to 4, says every person.
[time=3020] Here it is.
[time=3021] It's one of the classic texts on this whole issue of civil government and the role of
[time=3027] the Christ follower.
[time=3028] Every person, Romans 13, 1, every person is to be in subjection to the governing
[time=3034] authorities.
[time=3036] For there is no authority except from God.
[time=3040] And those which exist are established by God.
[time=3044] Therefore, whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God.
[time=3049] And they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
[time=3055] For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior.
[time=3058] You don't fear a ruler because you behave well.
[time=3061] But for evil, do you want to have no fear of authority?
[time=3064] Do what is good.
[time=3066] And you will have praise from the same for it is a minister of God to you for good.
[time=3072] But if you do what is evil, be afraid for it does not bear the sword for nothing.
[time=3077] For it is a minister of God and a avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.
[time=3086] There is no think about it.
[time=3088] There is no ruler, no king, no president.
[time=3092] I almost entitled this message, what if John Kerry were president?
[time=3097] And I'm not being funny.
[time=3101] I can't believe some of the things that we say.
[time=3104] I go back to November and I just listen to Christ followers making comments about how it
[time=3111] would be and how they'd do this and how they'd do that.
[time=3115] You know, just how awful it would be if so and so.
[time=3119] You know what?
[time=3120] We're not talking about political opinion here.
[time=3122] We're talking about a mindset toward authority.
[time=3125] And no matter who's president, no matter who's in Congress, no matter who's a representative, any mayor, any city council member, any prime minister, any premier, any rebel.
[time=3135] There isn't a single person in authority that God didn't allow to be in authority.
[time=3143] And he gives you and I clear direction on how we are to treat them, how we are to respond
[time=3149] to them.
[time=3153] Some things you might want to just think about.
[time=3155] Pretty basic, pretty straightforward.
[time=3157] Obey the laws.
[time=3159] Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities.
[time=3163] Listen, obey the laws.
[time=3165] Respect the lawmakers.
[time=3167] Now, doesn't mean you respect.
[time=3169] At this point, we're not at a moral point here.
[time=3173] There may be some laws that get passed.
[time=3175] You and I know of a few that we would not agree with.
[time=3178] That we would stand absolutely against in terms of our moral conviction.
[time=3183] And we should.
[time=3185] But when you get to and we come down to the way you and I would treat them, the way you
[time=3191] and I would talk about them, the kind of posture we would have towards them.
[time=3196] Obey the laws.
[time=3198] Be willing to show respect for the lawmakers.
[time=3200] Appreciate the law enforcers.
[time=3202] There are men and women you know and I know who give their lives for us, each and every
[time=3208] day, in an effort to enforce this authority that God has given.
[time=3212] Appreciate them.
[time=3213] Submit to the authority.
[time=3216] And here's the caveat, right?
[time=3217] Here's the one.
[time=3218] Here's the one exception.
[time=3219] Unless that authority is telling you to what?
[time=3223] Say it louder.
[time=3225] You don't sin.
[time=3227] You don't sin because the congressman told you to.
[time=3232] You don't sin because your boss said you had to.
[time=3236] You just don't.
[time=3238] You don't sin.
[time=3240] That's where you draw the line.
[time=3242] And that's where you and I would need to if we were in that position, you need to draw that line respectfully, but you draw it.
[time=3248] Go to Acts chapter four and you'll see this.
[time=3251] Acts chapter four, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans.
[time=3255] Just go back a few pages to Acts chapter four.
[time=3259] Here we see the exception.
[time=3261] Here's where you and I draw the line.
[time=3263] See, Peter and John, God told Peter and John.
[time=3267] God said to Peter and John, "Preach the gospel." This was God's plan.
[time=3272] They knew it.
[time=3273] He had said it.
[time=3274] They were being obedient to God.
[time=3275] And as they preached the gospel, boy, I tell you, there was an enormous response in Jerusalem.
[time=3282] People began to come to faith in Christ.
[time=3285] And we find in Acts four, verse 18, the leaders there.
[time=3289] The city council, so to speak, calls them in.
[time=3292] They don't like what they're seeing and they're going to put an end to it.
[time=3295] And when they had verse 18 and when they had summoned them, they, the authorities, commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
[time=3306] Peter and John answered and said to them whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge.
[time=3314] For we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.
[time=3321] You go over to Acts five.
[time=3324] It just kind of kept going.
[time=3326] Acts five, 27, when they had brought them, they stood them before the council.
[time=3331] They had continued to preach momentum and the Christian movement had continued to gain speed.
[time=3337] And when they had brought them, they stood them before the council.
[time=3340] And the high priest questioned them saying, we gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name.
[time=3347] And yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.
[time=3354] But Peter and the apostles answered, we must obey who?
[time=3358] Say it.
[time=3360] We must obey God rather than who?
[time=3363] Say it, men.
[time=3366] We must obey God rather than men.
[time=3371] A lot to say, a lot to look at, folks.
[time=3374] A lot for you and I to consider as we think about our posture as a believing community under the authority that God has ordained in your homeowners association.
[time=3387] In your township, in your district, in your city, in your state, in your country.
[time=3393] There are people in authority.
[time=3396] And God says, there's a way in which you and I are to live and respond in subjection to them.
[time=3403] Because as we subject ourselves to the God-ordained authority, we show our willingness to subject ourselves to who?
[time=3411] To him.
[time=3412] And so we'll look at that in the weeks to come.
[time=3415] And I pray you'll come back and continue along in our study.
[time=3419] Would you stand?
[time=3420] And can I pray for us as we go?
[time=3425] Father, God, we stand so, so very amazed and grateful again that in your word,

[time=3437] God, there is help and guidance and truth for each of us as we seek to live out this life, God, that you've called us to.
[time=3445] And I pray, God, for those in the room this morning who may be at this stage don't know you yet, God, their spiritual journey has them at a point where they're still considering this life-changing relationship with you.

[time=3466] God, I pray that if there are questions that need to be asked, that they would ask, God, I pray that if there are friends that they have and trust, I pray that they would further that discussion.
[time=3476] God, if there isn't, if they are in need of someone who would sit and talk with them, God, I pray that they would make their way to us.
[time=3484] Thank you so very much for how you allow us to be a part of that.
