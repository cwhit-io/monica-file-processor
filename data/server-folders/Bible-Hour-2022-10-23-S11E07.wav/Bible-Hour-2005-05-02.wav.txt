[time=177] (dramatic music) [AMEN] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I am so thankful to be able to bring to you again a new segment that we've started just a couple of months ago.
[time=194] We're calling it celebrating the church of Fort Wayne, and we're doing that lately around here.
[time=201] More and more so, we are so thankful for what God is doing in the church of Fort Wayne.
[time=206] There are so many places where there are faithful people, men and women, who are giving themselves to ministry and doing everything they can with God's help to see people far from God come to know Him in a personal life-changing way.
[time=221] And so with the Bible hour and all the resources God has given us, we felt like it would be a great opportunity to share some of that ministry with you, to introduce you to some people, and to help you know more about some great, great churches where there is some significant ministry taking place.
[time=240] And so I'm privileged today to have Dan Chittwood, who is the senior pastor at Crossbridge Community Church with us, and we are so thankful for what God is doing at Crossbridge, so very thankful for Dan, for the team that God has put around him, and for the lives that they are reaching.
[time=259] I wanted him to come today, and I wanted him to be able to share with you a little bit about that ministry.
[time=265] And so Dan, thank you for being here.
[time=267] Thank you so very much for taking the time to come.
[time=271] And I want you all to know a little bit about their history, first of all.
[time=274] And so Dan, just share with the folks briefly, the story of Crossbridge, kind of how it came into being, and how God has taken you from its beginnings to where you are today.
[time=285] - Yeah, well, we used to be a park forest, church of God on Stell Horn Road, and then several years ago, about four years ago, just felt God kind of prompting some changes in the kind of church we were.
[time=300] And that started a progression to become a church that became focused on creating a place where people that were unfamiliar with church could find a safe place to journey toward God.
[time=311] And that process led us to realize that our current facility landlocked us, the growth we were experiencing didn't allow us to continue to build at the pace or the way that we needed to to facilitate what God was doing at Crossbridge.
[time=325] And so what we did is we sold our building in August of '02 and became a portable church and moved to the northwest area of Fort Wayne.
[time=335] And we meet at Shawnee Middle School now.
[time=338] And our purpose was, like we said, to create a safe place for people to journey towards God, people that maybe had had past church experiences, maybe who have never been to church.
[time=349] But for them, walking through a traditional church door was a little intimidating.
[time=356] But yet, to walk into church that's held in a school, maybe it's a little less intimidating.
[time=361] And then along that process, we knew that we're gonna need a facility someday.
[time=365] We're portable on a necessity right now, not because of choice.
[time=369] We'd like to have a new campus again.
[time=372] And the plans are to begin the building process, site development this summer for that facility out on the northeast corner of I69 in Hirsch Road.
[time=383] And that site development starts this fall, this spring.
[time=388] And we're excited about that.
[time=390] But it's kind of what got us to today here where we're at.
[time=394] - Yeah, that's great.
[time=395] What a great story.
[time=397] Dan, let me ask you this.
[time=398] When you think about it in your own heart and mind, when you talk to people who are interested in Crossbridge, even when you and your team are discussing it, we do the same thing here.
[time=408] What is the mission clearly stated?
[time=412] I mean, how would you say to somebody what the real bottom line gut level widest cross bridge exists?
[time=420] You mentioned a little bit about that, but talk about that a little bit more.
[time=423] Share with the folks the reason you guys get up every day and do what you do.
[time=427] - Yeah, clearly stated is easy, clean cut as we can put it.
[time=432] We exist to reach and develop people and to fully devoted followers of Christ.
[time=436] And that's our mission statement on paper and it sounds real institutionalized, real clean and cut and it's easy to put on the bottom of a letterhead.
[time=445] But I love getting the opportunity just to explain a little bit more detail 'cause as it really flushes out on a daily basis, why we get up in the morning is because we wanna have a place for people to find out what it authentically means to genuinely journey with God.
[time=462] And sometimes that's the good, the bad, the ugly of a relationship with God, of understanding kind of how you walk through life.
[time=473] And consistently we hear people when they talk about cross bridge, they'll say, you know what, this is, you guys are real.
[time=480] I come here and the stuff the pastor teaches about, it makes sense in my daily life, Monday through Saturday.
[time=487] The way they're vulnerable, they look like real people.
[time=490] They sound like real people.
[time=494] Kind of the way we've described cross bridge as a mission of is to try and get rid of those secret handshakes that often exist in church that make people who are unfamiliar with church uncomfortable because they sit in our settings and they're not real familiar when to sit or when to stand or exactly where to go in their Bible for a story.
[time=512] And so we try to break down those walls and make it as easy for people as possible to find God.
[time=520] And kind of a word we use is journey.
[time=523] We say, you know, we're all on this journey toward God.
[time=526] And I like the word journey because in a journey, you don't know the specific destination sometimes, but you kind of know the general direction.
[time=534] You kind of know, hey, this is generally where I'm headed but I don't know exactly what this adventure is gonna hold.
[time=540] And I think the people when they come to cross bridge, they have a general idea that they're searching for something.
[time=546] There's a passage in the Bible that says, God has said eternity in the hearts of men.
[time=551] And we believe that he's put this homing beak in our own personal on-star inside us that's calling out and longing for an eternity with him.
[time=560] And but we don't know how to find it.
[time=562] And so as we're on that search and we're that journey for him, that's where cross bridge steps in.
[time=569] It says, let's journey together.
[time=570] Let's see what that adventure looks like.
[time=572] Let's do life deeply connected with each other.
[time=574] Let's explore the truths of the Bible.
[time=577] Let's a lot of times people will say about churches these days in today's society that they're just watering down a message for people.
[time=586] And boy, we would really say that doesn't happen at cross bridge.
[time=590] We still hold true to biblical foundations, but we wanna make it culturally relevant to people.
[time=596] We want them to be able to see the Bible stories come alive and the Bible truths come alive in their everyday life using modern day language, modern day illustrations.
[time=607] And so for us, that's what captures the heart of cross bridge.
[time=611] But then not just for people who don't know God to journey towards him and find him, but then your journey doesn't stop there.
[time=619] Once you become a Christ follower and as you're on that journey, to continually grow deeper and deeper.
[time=624] So that's why we say to develop as a Christ follower as well as part of our mission, because we wanna partner with people we're ever there at on their spiritual journey and help them grow deeper in that personal relationship.
[time=638] - Very cool.
[time=640] Well, let me have you do this.
[time=642] Just say to the folks again, where you're telling when you meet, tell 'em where you meet.
[time=649] We'll even, as you're talking, give 'em the website or any other information on the bottom of the screen.
[time=654] But just give the folks the basic information on where you meet, what time, and where they should go as far as asking any questions that they might have.
[time=662] - Sure.
[time=663] We meet at Shawnee Middle School, which is just off the corner of Cook Road and Coldwater Road.
[time=669] And our service times are Sunday morning at 10 o'clock.
[time=673] Our website is crossbridgecommunity.org, our phone number 485-5-613.
[time=680] And we'd love to have you come check us out.
[time=683] We're a pretty casual church, so it's kind of a come as you are.
[time=686] And services wrap up by about 11, 15, and there's opportunities and things going on for kids of all ages, from nursery to bridge kids, age kids that take 'em all the way up to middle school, and then stuff from middle schoolers and our teens that are stuff just separate from them.
[time=702] If they'd like to hang out with mom and dad in the service, they're welcome too, but we have opportunities for them to connect with God that day in ways that are relevant to them.
[time=711] - Fantastic.
[time=713] Well, thank you so much, Dan, for being here and thank you for sharing with our audience the ministry that God has given you guys.
[time=721] We are so thankful for it, and I want all you to know, again, like we've said before, crossbridge may be in your neighborhood.
[time=729] It may be a place that God is leading you toward, and we wanna make sure that you're aware of what's going on.
[time=735] Dan has even brought some friends from his church, some people that God has really ministered to from his work there at crossbridge.
[time=746] Their names are?
[time=747] - Adrian Gunther, Adrian and Kelly.
[time=750] - Yep, Adrian and Kelly, and so we're gonna get a chance here in just a minute to hear from Adrian and Kelly.
[time=756] Nothing like changed lives, nothing at all.
[time=758] It's why we do what we do, and we're so thankful he's doing what he's doing at crossbridge.
[time=764] - Hi, my name is Kelly, me, and my husband and I are so thankful for crossbridge and what it's done to change our lives, and our story really starts.
[time=776] We moved out to the Northwest area, and we just really felt that we needed to look for a church that we would be making connections with people in our community, and really just for our child as well, we have a five-year-old daughter, Meredith, and we just really felt that she needed to be in a church where she would be with children that she'd be in the same school with.
[time=800] And I've been a Christ follower for several years, and when we came to crossbridge, we just really made lots of meaningful friendships and connections, and through the whole process, my husband became a Christ follower as well, and was baptized last year.
[time=819] And we now belong to a small group where we, as Pastor Dan says, we do life together, and we truly do.
[time=828] We actually, I just had back surgery about 12 weeks ago,
[time=834] and it was amazing how the friendships and just the connections that we made in our small group, how the people surrounded us, brought us meals when we needed them, and just took Meredith whenever we needed her, and it was just amazing how they were there to support us when we needed it, and we're just thankful for the friendships we've made, and just, we enjoy church.
[time=863] My daughter loves to go every Sunday when she's, even when she's sick, she's wanting to go, and I can't say enough for Bridge Kids Ministry, and just how it's really impacted my daughter even at the age of five.
[time=879] And I am a school teacher, so I have a real appreciation for what all of the volunteers are doing in crossbridge kids today.
[time=889] My name's Adrian Gunther, and my family is eternally grateful to Crossbridge Community Church.
[time=895] I was a real skeptic before stepping into Crossbridge, and I didn't really want to go to church because I was disillusioned, and I'd always believed in God and had a relationship with God that I had kind of made up in my head, and I picked pieces from here and pieces from there, and came up with a belief system that I was very comfortable with that I could live with, but it allowed me to do things that I shouldn't have been doing, and my wife said we had a three-year-old son, our first child, we're blessed with three now, but that we need to get our kid involved in a church just to have some kind of a structure in our life, and so we really did it for our son, and lo and behold, God was working through that because my eyes were opened up to the truth, and from the very first day I walked in there, it wasn't about religion anymore, it was about a real relationship with a loving God, and it was actualized through the people of Crossbridge.
[time=958] We were so welcomed into this environment, people went out of their way to introduce themselves to us and make us feel like we were at home.
[time=967] I'd been in other churches where you just kind of wanted to sit in the back and shrink down in the pew or in your chair and not get noticed, but in this place it felt good and comfortable to be noticed, even though we weren't ready for that.
[time=982] And since then, I just have developed a truth, I know the truth, through Crossbridge's teachings, and my kids, all three kids now are involved in the student ministries every week and learning about God and teaching us about God, and I'm learning lessons from my children, from my pastor, from my small group, all the love, and I just could never be happier than since I went to Crossbridge community church, so thank you.

[time=1099] (upbeat music) - First Peter, when holiness meets hostility,
[time=1110] this has been our study for the last, oh, a couple of months now, moving on three, and what a study it has been.
[time=1117] And that phrase there, that kind of summarizes in essence what we've seen so far.
[time=1122] God calls you and I, my friends, to a response.
[time=1127] There is a way that he wants us to live.
[time=1129] There is a way in which he has called you and I to live out our faith.
[time=1134] And as we've made our way through first Peter, we've already come to the passage where, in kind of summary form, he says to you and I, be holy.
[time=1143] Be holy.
[time=1145] And it was a great discussion because it wasn't so much about necessarily what you and I do.
[time=1150] It was more about who you and I are.
[time=1153] There was the call to be Christ followers.
[time=1156] There was the call to be the kind of people.
[time=1158] At the heart level that God has called us to be, and that calls forth from you and I, a response.
[time=1165] And again, and again, and again, as we've been making our way through here, we see that there is a response.
[time=1170] There is a kind of heart.
[time=1172] There is a kind of decision.
[time=1174] There is a kind of people that he wants you and I to be in the face of, in the midst of whatever it is we might encounter.
[time=1182] Whatever hostility might come our way.
[time=1185] Whatever trial or suffering we may face.
[time=1188] God's word calls, and especially here in first Peter, he calls for a response.
[time=1192] And we find ourselves today, coming back to a passage that we began last week.
[time=1197] And here in this passage, in first Peter 2, 13 through 17, we see that there is a kind of response.
[time=1204] There is a kind of a decision that you and I make at the heart level in relationship to those in authority in our lives.
[time=1216] Our response to government.
[time=1218] Our response to civil leaders.
[time=1221] Our response to those who God has placed in authority in our lives.
[time=1225] And let me, if I can, just take you back to the passage we had just started last week.
[time=1230] We didn't get very far, but let me just take you back there if I can.
[time=1233] First Peter chapter 2, verses 13 through 17.
[time=1237] And in honor of God's word, would you stand as we read this together?
[time=1243] Peter writes there in first Peter 2, 13, submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and the praise of those who do right for such is the will of God.
[time=1263] That by doing right, you may silence the ignorance of foolish men, act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bond slaves of God.
[time=1276] Honor all people.
[time=1278] Love the brotherhood.
[time=1279] Fear God.
[time=1281] Honor the king.
[time=1284] Let me ask you to pray with me if you would.
[time=1285] Father God, we stand humbly before you this morning.
[time=1290] Having already experienced the blessing God of worship and the privilege God of coming before you, expressing our gratitude, singing our praise, God communicating our thanks.
[time=1303] And above all, God, lifting you up.
[time=1306] And you are indeed high and lifted up.
[time=1308] And what a privilege it is for us to come into your presence.
[time=1312] God teach us this morning.
[time=1314] Help us to see things we've never seen.
[time=1316] God remind us of truth that perhaps we've forgotten.
[time=1320] Allow us to be a people who respond to authority.
[time=1324] God in the way that you've designed it.
[time=1327] Please, God, move us in that direction for us.
[time=1329] In your son's name, we pray.
[time=1331] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1335] I've got to tell you right out of the gate that this is about, not this passage as you study it, and as you become a little bit more familiar with it, this is bottom line, my friends, on this responding to authority thing.
[time=1348] This is bottom line about a hard attitude.
[time=1352] There will be some things as we make our way through the passage.
[time=1355] There will be some things that you and I should do.
[time=1357] That's true, but mainly this is about an attitude.
[time=1361] This is about a mindset.
[time=1362] It's about an approach.
[time=1364] And I got to tell you, I wish I had better news for you on this one, but I just got to share with you an instance here recently where I personally didn't do so well on this front.
[time=1377] I, many of you know that we were on vacation recently.
[time=1382] We went out to California for spring break, had a great eight, nine days.
[time=1385] Some of you may know this, others of you may not.
[time=1388] About four or five days into it, I lost my wallet.
[time=1393] I lost my, I don't know.
[time=1394] You may ever have lost their wallet before.
[time=1396] Actually, I like to say my wallet got stolen.
[time=1398] That sounds better.
[time=1400] My wallet, I left it out by the pool, went away, came back and it was gone.
[time=1404] And I wasn't quite sure if I had left it there.
[time=1406] So then I spent the next half day looking for it in the room, quizzing every one of my kids as to where they might have placed it.
[time=1414] But that didn't go so well.
[time=1415] And finally just realized, you know what, it's gone.
[time=1418] Somebody took it and then you have to go through all the, you've been there.
[time=1421] You call all the credit card people, you call the bank, you call everybody, you gotta call.
[time=1426] $1,500 had already been rung up at the local Sears store and somebody got a new refrigerator.
[time=1435] And which, you know, it was a heart break, but we didn't, you know, we worked that out with the folks and we weren't held liable for that.
[time=1441] But anyway, long story short, I didn't have my wallet.
[time=1444] And then my wallet was my ID, my driver's license.
[time=1448] And we were flying back to Indiana the next day.
[time=1450] So now all of a sudden I'm just envisioning or two or three days later.
[time=1453] I'm envisioning just an absolute, you know, chaotic deal at the airport, you know, me saying, "Hey, I don't have my ID in them going, you know, ch, ch." You know, and I'm thinking, "How am I gonna do this?" So I caught, then I had to spend another three hours on the phone with Indianapolis, trying to get them to fax me a letter to the hotel, verifying I am who I say I was and they faxed it to me and I got it and the gals said last word, she says, "Hey, good luck." She says, "You're going through LAX, right?" And I said, "Yeah." She goes, "Good luck, hope you make it." So we go to the airport, we get through.
[time=1487] Kevin, the kids get through over there.
[time=1489] I get to go to the special line and that was quite an experience but we won't get into that.
[time=1494] But I got through.
[time=1495] So we got home but I don't have a driver's license.
[time=1498] So I got to go get a driver's license.
[time=1500] And I let a few days go and I think I got to get a driver's license.
[time=1504] I'm driving my car and I don't have a license.
[time=1506] So I go to get a driver's license.
[time=1508] I visit one of our local B&V, is that right?
[time=1512] One of our local B&V branches.
[time=1514] And let me just say this to you before I go any further.
[time=1517] It hadn't been a good day.
[time=1520] Can I just say that?
[time=1521] Is that, can I just say that to you?
[time=1523] I know this is embarrassing.
[time=1524] I'm supposed to be better than this but I'm just, sometimes I'm just not.
[time=1528] It just hadn't been a good day.
[time=1529] And I go to the B&V and you know you walk into the B&V and you know how they've got the whole setup there.
[time=1536] It's a very warm environment as you can attest to the metal chairs and the number grabber and then there's the five gals waiting for whoever might come up next.
[time=1545] And I walk in and I grab my number and I sit down.
[time=1548] Did I mention it hadn't been a good day?
[time=1550] Did I say okay, I was not in good shape.
[time=1553] We won't get into why but it just hadn't been a good day.
[time=1555] And I don't know if you ever play this game but I play this game in these situations.
[time=1559] You begin to sit there and realize there's the numbers tick down and you've got your five options.
[time=1563] There are the gals are.
[time=1564] And you begin to kind of, and when you're at the B&V you hear everything that's going on in their conversations.
[time=1569] And so you know who's having a good day and who's having a bad day.
[time=1573] You know who's gonna be really helpful and you know who might not be.
[time=1577] So I'm watching this whole thing unfold and did I mention I hadn't had a good day.
[time=1581] And as it counts down to my number it becomes plainly obvious to me that yes in fact I will soon be pulling up a chair with the one individual there who in my 20 minutes I had assessed I probably me having the day I had had and her obviously having the day she was having it wasn't gonna be good but sure enough God and his humor.
[time=1600] Boom.
[time=1601] Number 32.
[time=1604] So I go walking up there and it's just faces
[time=1613] it's just real simple I just I walk up and I said hey hi how are you I lost my wall it actually got stolen out in California on spring break and I got able I got all my credit cards and stuff taken care of but I don't have my license and so what we did get back through the airport she's looking at me like do you think I care about this.
[time=1630] And I said I'm sorry I need a driver's license.
[time=1634] You need a driver's license.
[time=1638] I need to see you lost a driver's license yes I need to see a birth certificate.
[time=1643] I said I'm sorry man I'm 42 years old I have no idea where my birth certificate is.
[time=1649] I don't know if that's uncommon or common but I'm not that organized I'm not that together I would have no clue where my birth certificate is.
[time=1659] And I'm kind of starting to talk that way and I'm feeling it inside you know and she kind of looks at me well then give me a passport.
[time=1668] He said you see I don't have a passport ma'am because I thought about that but my passport's expired it's at home I can go get it but it's expired it has my picture on it though and see this is killing me because I'm like look I want to look at her screen because I know she's got me pulled up.
[time=1685] She's got my information right there the pictures there the addresses there the mother's made name is there everything all she's got to do is just give me a license.
[time=1696] I said I thought about the passport
[time=1702] but then they said I needed ID and I don't have ID.
[time=1706] That's why I'm here I need a license please she goes you don't have a passport you don't have a birth certificate you don't get a license.
[time=1712] So you know what she kept talking and I'm sorry
[time=1720] and I mean that I hate I hate embarrassing you but she kept talking and did I mention I had a bad day I got up while she was talking then I left.
[time=1735] I just left I just kind of did the push away from the counter you've done that and I just got up with my little attitude mid-sentence she wasn't done and I left and I felt justified for the first 30 feet
[time=1753] and then as soon as my feet hit the pavement on the parking lot I just said oh God I pray she doesn't watch the Bible hour.
[time=1762] No I'm serious you have no idea you have no idea
[time=1768] she may be watching right now I am I am coming back
[time=1774] but there's that accountability you know you may think gosh that must be hard living with that kind of accountability well you know what I would say you have the same I would say we all have the same.
[time=1787] She didn't deserve to be treated that way she was just doing her what she was just doing her job she didn't make the law did she she was just enforcing it you need a birth certificate or a valid passport to get a new driver's license it may not make sense it may be incredibly frustrating but she was just doing her job and I got up and I walked out.
[time=1816] As fully surrendered followers of Christ as redeemed children of God scripture teaches that our true allegiance our true citizenship our true home is in a place called what?
[time=1829] Heaven that's right and as citizens of heaven Christ followers are to submit completely to God's divine authority in each and every form that that might take we live in submission to God and it's true or right is that principle is there is a potential danger for misapplication of that truth or sometimes the complete ignorance of that truth believers can and have at times become indifferent agitated and even disdainful toward that authority when it comes in the form of the governmental political civil or institutional authorities that govern and lead us in the everyday of life.
[time=1869] The convictions of zealous Christ followers can at times clash with the governmental powers and there is that potential that in the clash and this was the tragedy of the BMV lady and me.
[time=1885] There is the potential that in the clash
[time=1891] in the revolt and the uprising in the getting up and walking out that the testimony that the testimony and potential influence
[time=1903] that the believer could have had is lost or greatly diminished by the lack of submission respect or compliance.
[time=1910] Why was she grumpy?
[time=1914] What life had she lived?
[time=1918] Where were her kids?
[time=1921] What kind of husband was she married to?
[time=1924] What had her morning been like?
[time=1927] See, I wouldn't be able to answer that because I didn't care.
[time=1933] I wanted a license and found myself outside the arena, outside the spectrum of how God works and how he calls you and I to respond day in and day out.
[time=1947] You see, our passage here teaches us today that love for God and citizenship in heaven must be balanced by a proper respect for and humble submission to all legitimate institutions of human authority.
[time=1963] The civil, social, and spiritual implications are huge.
[time=1967] Last week we saw the first point.
[time=1968] Write this down if you're catching up.
[time=1969] If not, you can review the notes you've already taken.
[time=1972] Last week we saw as the passage began, the command for submission.
[time=1976] God just commands it.
[time=1978] He says in verse 13, submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution.
[time=1985] Submit yourselves.
[time=1987] Although ultimately in the end, we are not under human authority.
[time=1990] We see here in our text that God still expects and requires believers to submit and to conduct themselves with an attitude of submission to human government and any institution that he has ordained.
[time=2004] That's right, that's the one point that I want you to catch from this first point.
[time=2008] We talked about it last week.
[time=2009] Here's the fundamental point we found here.
[time=2012] The fundamental point to keep in mind is that submission, submission to rulers is right because God appoints rulers.
[time=2020] We saw this in Romans 13, write that down.
[time=2023] Romans 13, one to four.
[time=2025] You see submission to leaders is right because God appoints leaders.
[time=2031] Submission to your boss is right because God appoints, see here's the point, there is no ruler, there is no king, there is no president, there is no congressman, there is no city councilman, there is no mayor, there is no prime minister, there is no none of them are where they are but by the sovereign authority of God.
[time=2051] And whoever God allows in, he calls you and I unless they want you to sin acts for.
[time=2060] He calls you and I to deal with them in a respectful manner.
[time=2064] Submit to authority.
[time=2067] Number two, now this is new, we're working our way through here.
[time=2071] New stuff for you this morning.
[time=2072] Number two, write this down, the motive for submission.
[time=2076] We've seen the command for submission.
[time=2077] Number two, I want you to see in our passage the motive for submission.
[time=2081] It says there, submit yourselves for the Lord's sake.
[time=2086] You see that?
[time=2086] For the Lord's sake to every human institution, the motive is stated as clearly as the command.
[time=2094] Number one, submit number two, do it to honor the Lord.
[time=2099] Not the civil authority, not the mayor, not the governor.
[time=2102] Not the boss, not the teacher, not the principal.
[time=2105] Yes, you should do that but that's all about at a motivational level your willingness and mind to honor the Lord for the Lord's sake.
[time=2116] Christians obey commands because followers of Christ desire to honor God.
[time=2121] We obey, write this down, we obey earthly authority to honor God's sovereign authority.
[time=2128] We obey and we follow and we posture ourselves respectfully toward earthly authority to honor God's sovereign authority.
[time=2139] I was reading this week, let me read this quote to you that I came across, found it true, fascinating and powerful.
[time=2145] It says here, God alone, God alone has sovereign rights.
[time=2150] Democratic theory is no less unscriptural than divine right monarchy.
[time=2155] By whatever means men come to positions of rulership by dynastic descent, aristocratic family connection, plutocratic material resources or by democratic election.
[time=2167] There is no power but from God, Romans 13, one.
[time=2172] You know, it's interesting as I think about this,
[time=2180] as always, guess who gives us the supreme and perfect example of this.
[time=2189] Guess who gives us the supreme and perfect example of submission to authority in an effort to honor the Father?
[time=2198] Who, Jesus, absolutely.
[time=2201] And we find the example right here in this book that we're studying, go down just a few verses to 1 Peter 2, 21.
[time=2209] And just listen, listen and take this in and remember the example he left.
[time=2214] For you have been called verse 21, for you have been called for this purpose.
[time=2219] Don't miss that.
[time=2219] You and I have been called by God to live the life that we live to follow him for this purpose since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps.
[time=2233] How's that sound?
[time=2234] Who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth.
[time=2239] And while being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[time=2242] While suffering, he uttered no threats, but kept what?
[time=2247] Say it, entrusting himself to him, who's him, to the Father.
[time=2252] But he uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously.
[time=2260] My friends, Jesus never overthrew a government.
[time=2264] Remember that.
[time=2267] He never overthrew a government.
[time=2270] Could he have?
[time=2271] Yes or no?
[time=2273] Yes.
[time=2274] He never led a demonstration.
[time=2277] He never engaged in any civil disobedience.
[time=2280] He was not outwardly in any way, shape, or form, or inwardly disrespectful to the authorities that be, to the authorities that were in authority at his time.
[time=2288] Now were they a corrupt group?
[time=2290] Yes or no?
[time=2291] Did they do things that were unfair and unrighteous and unreasonable?
[time=2294] Yes or no?
[time=2296] Yes.
[time=2297] And then some.
[time=2298] But he submitted.
[time=2306] Why no protests, why no sit-ins, why do you fall in line?
[time=2311] Here you go, I'm gonna tell you.
[time=2315] And this, my friends, this is a really, really good answer.
[time=2320] I mean, this is as I kind of made my way through this passage here.
[time=2323] This is where I found myself going, oh my.
[time=2326] Now this is something for us to hold on to right here.
[time=2330] You know why he didn't?
[time=2332] You know why there were no protests?
[time=2333] You know why there were no sit-ins?
[time=2334] You know why no government was overthrown?
[time=2336] You know why he just fell in line and kept going down the road?
[time=2340] Because he had an understanding and a conviction that he had ministry to do.
[time=2346] There was a greater purpose in play.
[time=2351] There was ministry to do.
[time=2352] There were lives to reach.
[time=2354] There were folks to encourage.
[time=2356] There was teaching that needed to be done.
[time=2358] There were people far from God.
[time=2359] He wanted to come close to God.
[time=2361] There was ministry to do.
[time=2365] And so he stayed the course.
[time=2367] He was in the end more concerned about people coming to faith than he was about social reform in the Sanhedrin, that the Sanhedrin needs social reform, I think so.
[time=2379] Or there's some problems there, yes.
[time=2381] But he had a passion for, and he had a perspective that had kept the priority of ministry, the opportunity for you and I to have an impact, to have an influence on.
[time=2395] Now, I'm okay with you being passionate about a social issue or two.
[time=2399] I really am, and I think God's okay.
[time=2401] I'm okay with you and I being concerned about at the social or governmental level, certain things may be needing to be made right and doing what we can within provided boundaries to give ourselves to that.
[time=2412] I'm all right with you having passion and interest in social issues, but the problem is don't forget your neighbor needs Christ.
[time=2425] Your friend down the road needs some new tires.
[time=2428] The lady on the corner needs her lawn mode.
[time=2433] 500 kids need teachers and helpers this summer.
[time=2439] I'm all right with you being passionate about social issues.
[time=2446] Don't forget the reason God put you here.
[time=2449] He put you and I here to do ministry.
[time=2452] Inside and outside these four walls, and that's what you and I must be given to respectfully.
[time=2460] Number three, the extent of submission.
[time=2463] We've seen how we are to submit.
[time=2465] We submit for the Lord's sake, now the extent, verses 13 and 14.
[time=2470] Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one on authority or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and the praise of those who do right.
[time=2480] Let me just say this briefly to you, then we're gonna move on, right this down.
[time=2483] There are three essential purposes for government.
[time=2488] Biblically, if you go back to Romans 13, three and four, and you see it even here in our text, there are three essential purposes for government.
[time=2497] Number one, the restraint of evil.
[time=2499] Number two, the promotion of public good, and number three, the punishment of wrongdoing.
[time=2505] Restraint of evil, promotion of public good, and the punishment of wrongdoing.
[time=2509] This is how God designed it.
[time=2511] So, here we go.
[time=2512] To maintain peace and order in society, God has ordained every human institution.
[time=2518] So to limit or make exception to the command, we're talking here about the extent to which we should submit wealth, to limit or make exception to the command, submit to every authority, would condone disobedience or disrespect.
[time=2534] We are two accepting cases of sin, the extent to which we are to submit should be consistent with what God's word says, and that means fully.
[time=2544] These are the things they do.
[time=2546] Submit to them, all of them, this is God's design.
[time=2551] And I gotta just point this out to you before we move on.
[time=2553] Look what Peter says here, and I think this is timely.
[time=2556] I think this is purposeful.
[time=2558] I think this is amazing.
[time=2560] He says, "Wether, look at verse 13.
[time=2561] "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake "to every human institution, whether to a what?" Say it, king, king.
[time=2570] Who is Peter writing to?
[time=2572] Christians, scattered abroad and there in Rome.
[time=2577] Christians, we've talked about this, my friends.
[time=2579] He writes to people who at that very time, as they were reading this, found themselves under the tyrannical rule of an absolutely deranged maniac who was killing and murdering and torturing.
[time=2594] King Nero, I mean, this is just absolutely amazing
[time=2600] to think of the context in which this must have been read.
[time=2602] But see, even Nero, as we look at God's design, and this is where I admit it gets a little confusing at times, even Nero was divinely allowed by God to carry out certain fundamental governmental needs.
[time=2618] It's not always done well, it's not always done right.
[time=2623] Peter says, the first century believers, submit, conduct yourself respectfully.
[time=2629] I'm in in verse 14, he says, "Or to governors as sent by him "for the punishment of evil doers "and the praise of those who do right." Peter here is echoing what Paul said in Romans 13 when he says that ruling officials have been designed by God first and foremost for the punishment of evil doers.
[time=2649] For the punishment of evil doers, you know, it's interesting to think about it.
[time=2652] Some years earlier in the Garden of Gethsemane, when they came to arrest Jesus to take him away to his death, Jesus had given a quick little capital punishment, government lesson, if you will, to a younger than extremely zealous disciple named who?
[time=2667] Peter, Matthew 26.50.
[time=2671] Think it'll come on the screen.
[time=2673] You can turn there if you'd like, Matthew 26.50.
[time=2675] It says, "And Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
[time=2684] And then verse 51 says, "And behold, one of those who were with Jesus, "that would have been Peter, "reached and drew out his sword, "and struck the slave of the high priest "and cut off his ear." Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, "for all those who take up the sword "shall perish by the what?
[time=2705] "By the sword." That's right, Jesus was clarifying the Roman government's right to use the sword against Peter if he used it on someone else.
[time=2714] Only the government, don't forget this, only the government has been given by God the right to punish law breakers, which means vigilante justice, which means you and I taking matters into our own hands, you and I determining that we're going to right the wrong, you and I being those that would execute punishment because of what we feel or are convicted about.
[time=2737] God's word clearly states this is not God's design.
[time=2740] Some might say, but wait a minute, wait a minute, if I don't fight back, if I don't right the wrong, I'll suffer, if I don't right the wrong, I'll face heartache, if I don't make it right, then me or my own will go through painful, difficult trials.
[time=2755] And I think Jesus was very aware of that.
[time=2759] I think Jesus understood that.
[time=2762] And the hard attitude that he calls for, he makes clear again and again and again.
[time=2768] If you go down to verse 18, just go down a few verses.
[time=2772] First Peter two, we'll get here next week.
[time=2774] But look what it says, slightly different context, exact same principle, servants, employees.
[time=2782] Be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, some of you in the room have good and gentle employers, some of you find yourself in positions of submission to an authority, and that authority is a really good authority, a kind authority, a sensitive authority, but also to those who are unreasonable.
[time=2805] For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience, toward God, a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly, for what credit is there?
[time=2817] If when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience, but if when you do what is right and suffer for it, you patiently endure it.
[time=2827] This finds favor with God.
[time=2830] God's word says vengeance is whose?
[time=2835] Vengeance is whose?
[time=2839] Mine, he says.
[time=2840] God's, who is it that will in time make all wrongs right?
[time=2845] Who?
[time=2847] God.
[time=2849] Whose retribution is most powerful and effective?
[time=2852] Say it.
[time=2853] God's.
[time=2854] Whose timing when it comes to retribution and vengeance is perfect.
[time=2858] Say it.
[time=2859] Whose sees a picture and scope of government life in the future far bigger than any picture you and I could ever comprehend?
[time=2866] Say it.
[time=2868] Who should you trust?
[time=2869] Say it.
[time=2870] God.
[time=2871] The reason, number four, write this down.
[time=2878] You've seen the extent, all the way, shy of them calling you to sin, you submit, you conduct yourself respectfully.
[time=2887] The reason, number four, for submission, verse 15.
[time=2890] For such here it is, for such is the will of God.
[time=2894] That by doing right, you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.
[time=2899] Boy, don't miss this, my friends.
[time=2901] The reason we ought to submit to every authority is clear.
[time=2905] That kind of response.
[time=2907] That type of submission.
[time=2910] That type of trusting, submissive, respectful conduct has the ability to silence critics of the gospel.
[time=2919] It's one of the most impactful of all life lessons.
[time=2922] There's a critic of the gospel that comes to mind.
[time=2929] There have been many, you understand?
[time=2932] There's a group of critics of the gospel that comes to mind.
[time=2936] They were called Roman soldiers.
[time=2938] I want to take you back to Luke 23.
[time=2942] You can write this down or turn there if you would.
[time=2944] I want to show you how this works out.
[time=2945] Luke 23, 39 to 47.
[time=2951] Luke 23, 39 says one of the criminals
[time=2959] who were hanged there was hurling abuse at him.
[time=2962] This is Jesus on the cross.
[time=2963] The two guys on both sides.
[time=2965] And one of them's hurling abuse at him saying, "Are you not the Christ?
[time=2969] "Save yourself.
[time=2971] "Over throw the government.
[time=2972] "Go against what the authorities have done to you.
[time=2975] "It's wrong.
[time=2976] "Save yourself at us." Verse 40, he goes on, but the other answered and rebuking him said, "Do you not even fear God "since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?" Verse 41, "And we indeed are suffering justly "for what we are receiving, "what we deserve for our deeds, "for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds.
[time=2997] "But this man has done nothing wrong.
[time=3000] "And he was saying, "Jesus, remember me "when you come into your kingdom." And he said to him, "Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you, "today you shall be with me in paradise." It was now about the sixth hour and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour because the sun was obscured and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
[time=3019] And Jesus crying out with a loud voice at Father into your hands, "I commit my spirit." Having said this, he breathed his last, watch this.
[time=3027] Now in the centurion saw what had happened.
[time=3030] Stop right there for a second.
[time=3033] Remember, he saw what had happened.
[time=3036] He witnessed all that had been done.
[time=3037] He took part in the punishment.
[time=3039] He was part of the brutality.
[time=3041] He saw all that came Christ's way.
[time=3044] And when he saw what had happened, he began, say it out loud, praising God.
[time=3052] You ever seen that?
[time=3054] You ever seen a hard, hard, turned soft?
[time=3057] You ever seen a skeptic silenced?
[time=3061] You ever seen a bitter, disappointed, angry soul?
[time=3067] Made light, new, and fresh.
[time=3073] It's an amazing thing.
[time=3074] He began praising God saying certainly this man was innocent.
[time=3083] I wish, I've learned from Mitchell, from Pastor Mitch.
[time=3088] I've learned from him over these last three years.
[time=3091] He has lovingly helped me realize that every encounter is a divine appointment.
[time=3098] And I wish I had walked into that BMV with some eyes and a heart open to what God could have done with that authority figure that I found myself under.
[time=3113] Who knows how I could have encouraged what I could have said.
[time=3118] Listen to this, the harshest, cruelest critic can be softened by the submissive, enduring spirit of a humble Christ follower.
[time=3127] I wanna read that to you again.
[time=3128] Listen, the harshest, cruelest critic can be softened by the submissive, enduring spirit of a humble wife.
[time=3143] By a humble son or daughter.
[time=3146] You see, the harshest, cruelest critic can be softened
[time=3152] by the submissive, enduring spirit of a humble employee.
[time=3156] The harshest, cruelest critic can be softened by the submissive, enduring spirit of a humble student.
[time=3164] It's just an amazing principle, my friends.
[time=3169] He does amazing things.
[time=3172] He softens the hardest of hearts with the submissive, enduring spirit of a humble Christ follower.
[time=3180] Number five, the attitude of submission.
[time=3183] Just write that down.
[time=3184] The attitude of submission.
[time=3186] Act as free men, verse 16.
[time=3188] Act as free men.
[time=3190] And do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bond slaves.
[time=3195] Here's the point there, my friends.
[time=3197] In relationship with Christ, you have been set free.
[time=3200] Listen, in relationship with him, see before Christ, you and I know that prior to relationship with Christ, we were, the Bible says, slaves to what?
[time=3210] Slaves to sin.
[time=3211] It's just who we were, but in Christ, we've been set free.
[time=3215] There is great freedom in him.
[time=3217] We have been freed from sin's condemnation.
[time=3219] We have been freed from the penalty of the law.
[time=3221] We have been freed from Satan's bondage, freed from the world control, freed from death's power.
[time=3227] And Peter says here, watch this.
[time=3228] He says, you're free.
[time=3229] You're saved, that's right.
[time=3231] You're redeemed.
[time=3232] Live like it.
[time=3233] And when you hear it is.
[time=3234] And when you come up against bad government, when you come up against poor leadership, when you come up against unfair, unreasonable treatment, don't use your freedom as a platform for sin, i.e., don't say, hey, listen, I'm free.
[time=3253] I'm saved, I'm redeemed, I'm a child of God, and I won't be treated like this.
[time=3260] No, to the contrary, he says, look at the text.
[time=3264] Use your freedom as bonds, as what?
[time=3267] As bonds, slaves of God.
[time=3271] Step back down.
[time=3272] Close your mouth.
[time=3274] Roll up your sleeves.
[time=3276] And with all that freedom, he says, give yourself humbly to whoever this person might be, to whatever decision that is that they've made.
[time=3288] Number six, the application.
[time=3290] It's the one verse that wraps the whole passage up.
[time=3293] The application of submission.
[time=3295] Here you go, four things.
[time=3296] Honor all people.
[time=3298] Love the brotherhood.
[time=3299] Fear God.
[time=3300] Honor the king.
[time=3302] How will this citizenship theology play out in the everyday of life?
[time=3307] And you know, I was trying to summarize this.
[time=3309] Last night, I was just sitting there looking at it and looking at it and looking at it, trying to summarize what we've seen here in this passage.
[time=3316] And you know me, I'm always trying to make it really, really simple.
[time=3322] I'm always trying my best to just make it really, really clear.
[time=3325] I need that for my own learning.
[time=3328] So as I'm thinking through all that we've just looked at, you know what, here's how I summarized it.
[time=3332] Your response in mind to authority.
[time=3335] You ready?
[time=3336] Here's what came to my-- here's-- I said, God help me here, and he helped me, and this is what I wrote down.
[time=3341] People, in relationship to authority, whether it's good or bad, whether it's fair, just, unreasonable, whatever it might be, I believe God calls you and I to be nice.
[time=3355] Be nice.
[time=3360] Be agreeable.
[time=3364] Be respectful.
[time=3367] Don't be a jerk.
[time=3370] Don't get up and walk out.
[time=3374] Be nice.
[time=3377] Honor all people.
[time=3379] You see that?
[time=3380] Honor, how many people?
[time=3382] I'm sorry, how many?
[time=3383] Oh, my friends, honor all people.
[time=3387] Genesis 1.26 says all people were made in the image of who?
[time=3392] Image of God, honor all of them.
[time=3393] Black people, white people, brown, yellow, rich people, poor, needy, cute, ugly, beautiful, handicapped, talented, bright, slow, or unstable.
[time=3402] Every one of them created in the image of God.
[time=3407] Be nice to them.
[time=3410] Honor them.
[time=3412] Love the brotherhood.
[time=3414] You can write that down.
[time=3416] Write down John 13, 34, and 35.
[time=3419] There should be no division between us.
[time=3421] There should be no disunity in our ranks.
[time=3423] There should be no fractured relationships.
[time=3425] There should be no gossiping, no bickering, no criticizing, no loneliness.
[time=3429] No isolation.
[time=3430] There should be widespread acts of love between you and I and for you and I, and a growing, deepening willingness to serve, encourage, pray for, and come alongside.
[time=3440] And when the on-looking world sees you responding to the bad authority with submission and grace, and when the on-looking world sees you and I deeply and radically devoted to each other in practical life-changing ways, they go, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[time=3458] What's going on here?
[time=3461] Fear God.
[time=3462] Honor the king.
[time=3464] He ends the passage the way he started.
[time=3467] I think a reiteration to those dear brothers and sisters in Rome.
[time=3472] When it's all said and done, honor Nero.
[time=3475] Wow.
[time=3476] Hey, would you stand and let's close?
[time=3478] And as you stand, would you bow your heads?
[time=3479] Would you close your eyes?
[time=3480] Let me just ask you one question.
[time=3484] I've been waiting to ask you this question all week.
[time=3489] And I know you've got one.
[time=3491] I'll say that before I ask the question.
[time=3493] I know you've got one.
[time=3496] And here's the question, who's your B.M.V. lady?
[time=3499] Who's your B.M.V. lady?
[time=3507] Who's that one that you know you just need to really, really be careful how you respond, that one
[time=3515] that you could maybe encourage, that one authority figure that you know there's room in your heart to grow as it relates to the kind of submission and the kind of respect that you're willing to extend.
[time=3527] God, as we go, please, we ask that you would move in our hearts.
[time=3531] God, I pray that you would open our eyes to the kind of people, the kind of things that we do yes, but the kind of attitudes, God, that we harbor, the way we conduct ourselves.
[time=3544] God, the words that we would choose, the motions that we would make, God, all of it, could you please help us do it in a way that could make a difference for all of eternity and help us with those that are leading.
[time=3557] God, allow us to be followers that follow well.
[time=3560] In your son's name, we pray.
[time=3562] [AMEN]
[time=3568] [SILENCE], God, I pray.
