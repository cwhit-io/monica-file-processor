[time=30] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=90] I've been through many hard trials, and I couldn't explain it no, no, I didn't know why.
[time=109] Well, I had to go through so much pain, but praise the Lord today.
[time=117] [MUSIC - 150 seconds]
[time=297] [APPLAUSE]
[time=316] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=374] A generation ago, we never would have thought it possible to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ into the borders of what now is the former Soviet Union with freedom and promise.
[time=385] However, the failure of communism and the fall of the once ominous Iron Curtain have propelled the doors to this region wide open.
[time=394] Opportunities to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ are now numerous.
[time=399] In this region, with a nation as immense in size as Russia alone, the need for a biblical, strategic and visionary plan is necessary.
[time=409] Consider the size of the largest self-contained country in the world, 9 million square miles, approximately one sixth of the Earth's land surface, 11 time zones wide, population of 145 million, 89 old blasts or states.
[time=429] Consider the region of the former Soviet Union and the need becomes even greater, 300 million unreached in the former Soviet republics, 1500 evangelical churches, approximately 17 churches per state, 90,000 unreached communities, less than 1% evangelical.
[time=452] With the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ and Russia's delicate political situation, we must be committed to redeeming the time.
[time=461] The leaders of the Russian Union of Evangelical Christian Baptists or UECB have adopted a strategy found in the Book of Acts to take the Gospel throughout the nation of Russia.
[time=473] This strategy is referred to as the Antioch Initiative.
[time=478] The Church of Antioch in the Book of Acts, Chapter 11, not only grew but gave birth to additional churches throughout its region, while looking to the Church of Jerusalem for support and guidance.
[time=490] Our hope is that within five to seven years, the Church there will have grown to the point that it becomes like the Church in the Book of Acts known as the Antioch Church.
[time=503] The vision is to see 50 Antioch churches impacting all of Russia by the year 2010.
[time=510] It will have a group of North American coalition churches that commit to building a relationship with the Antioch Church while providing training for its pastors, worship leaders, church planters, teachers for children and youth.
[time=523] The Antioch Initiative and what our student team gets to do this year really is going to kick off for Blackhawk, and in many ways I think the Church of Northern Indiana, Fort Wayne area who are part of this.
[time=538] And we get to be the first team over, so we get to experience something that's brand new.
[time=545] For our kids, I think it's good because they get to be in the building blocks of a brand new program.
[time=552] I'm really excited about this trip because it really represents the very first trip of the Northeast Indiana Antioch coalition to Ivanovo and Vladimir Obles.
[time=564] The coalition started its work of last October with a vision trip for a number of the pastors here in the Fort Wayne area, and people got excited about it, and now this is kind of the kickoff.
[time=581] Pastoral training is the backbone of the Antioch partnership.
[time=585] The coalition will assume the responsibility for this training by sending its pastors, church leaders or others to teach the pastors and church planters of their adopted region.
[time=596] Though the cost is substantial, it represents the highest priority of the Antioch Initiative.
[time=603] The primary objective is to help strengthen the central church in its region to become a training, equipping and sending station.
[time=612] The Antioch Initiative commitment is approximately a five to seven year all-out effort to raise up a self-sufficient Antioch church that shares the gospel with those around it.
[time=623] Teaches and trains others to do the work of the ministry gives sacrificially and gives birth to other churches that will do the same.
[time=633] We believe that the Antioch Initiative is God's vision for proclaiming the gospel throughout the nation of Russia.
[time=640] Therefore, we believe he will provide what is necessary to carry the vision to its completion.
[time=646] Just know how he feels about people in this world, about the people in Yvonne and how much he loves them and how much I should be loving them and wanting to serve them.
[time=655] Each time I go on one of these, it grows me closer to how he wants me to be, and that's really why I want to go again this year.
[time=662] They went through a process to get even on the team, interviewed process.
[time=667] They just did a lot of things, you know, previous commitments from before to be committed to this team was another big aspect of the whole process.
[time=675] And to see them that committed for Jesus, I just lights my world up.
[time=680] It's been told to us many times in this process that revival starts in youth, and that's really truth, that revival starts within youth.
[time=688] And so I believe my God's big enough to start a revival, and I believe he's capable that within a small group, whether that's just in our youth group or revival, or within our church or within Russia, I just know, and I'm so excited and open to a revival.
[time=706] What a great opportunity, and that church that you saw in the piece, that is the church there in Yvonnevo, and that is the church that we, all of you, and myself, this family here at Blackhawk, that's the church, those are the people, that's the room, that was the pastor.
[time=721] I mean, that's the place that we've been given to love, care for, come alongside and invest in.
[time=726] They believe that church has the potential to be a church that could greatly impact their region and that world over there.
[time=733] So we're going to give you opportunities in the days to come.
[time=736] One of the initial ones is the chance that Rick has with his team to go, and before he shares with you, I'm going to ask Brent, if Brent would just let you know, he's going to tell you the other churches in the Fort Wayne area that we're partnering with.
[time=748] And also Brent, just share with the folks what encourages you the most as you think about this opportunity.
[time=755] Sure, we are looking to get 10 churches total to be a part of this initiative, there are four right now, Wallen Baptist, with Pastor John Suge, Maryam Christian Chapel, Pastor Terry Zulman, North Park Community Church, Pastor Scott Walls, and then Blackhawk.
[time=770] We're still working to get the others, but I think the thing that encourages me most is that this is a cornerstone, a foundational point of where global ministry is going to go in this place.
[time=781] It's not just a project, it's not something we throw dollars at, it's something that we invest our people and our time in.
[time=787] And it all traces back several years ago to the relationship we had with this church when the choir went over.
[time=793] Scott Schindler, our good friend Scott, took the choir over about four years ago to Yvonnevo.
[time=799] This was the church, these are the people that he met, and that they were able to build a relationship with.
[time=804] And so now four years later, we get to kind of renew that, so that's good stuff.
[time=807] Rick, tell the folks how we can pray for your trip coming up.
[time=810] Alright, there's a lot of stuff you can pray for, and I just was thinking, Kelly, that maybe we should make a prayer list, a card for you, and available out there at the kiosks.
[time=819] That would be great.
[time=820] Or you can call student ministries, and we could send you one, but we need you to pray.
[time=825] We've already had our first stumbling block.
[time=828] Barb Balschmidt, one of our longtime leaders and volunteers, is going to be unable to go with us on this trip, so we're down one member now, which is pretty important.
[time=838] We have 12 girls and only one female staff, so first big thing to pray for is a replacement leader, someone who could come and join our team and help us.
[time=847] That's really, really needed, so please pray for that.
[time=850] Second thing is just that God would really grow his kingdom in our hearts, that we can understand being a missionary.
[time=859] Missions is not about going there, wherever there is, but it's right here, every day, for all of us, being a Christian is synonymous with being a missionary.
[time=868] And so we want our students to learn that, and I want to learn that too, more.
[time=872] Third thing, one thing I didn't mention first, I always pray for the parents.
[time=876] My mom is kind of nervous, I think about me going, but I can't imagine sending your son or daughter for how many time zones away, and just for them to be comforted and know that
[time=888] God's in control of all that.
[time=891] But finally, the big stuff, the main things, as always, protection, the people are going to get to meet the relationships we're going to have and the finances.
[time=901] We're in the process of raising about $2,500 a person to go.
[time=906] That's a big ask of God, but we know that he's faithful to hear our prayers and can provide that.
[time=914] So thank you in advance for your prayer support and your partnership.
[time=917] >> Absolutely.
[time=918] >> Mitch, would you pray for the initiative and pray for Rick and the team as they continue to prepare to go?
[time=924] >> Let's pray.
[time=926] And now God, I just pray for Rick and Brent and Kelly and every student, every person in this room, who will be part of your divinely ordained
[time=943] kingdom growth movement to go and make disciples and to do that in community, community that multiplies community.
[time=959] God, I pray that this whole initiative would not be by any man's might, not by any man's power, but only by your Holy Spirit.
[time=971] God, I pray that you soften the hearts of the students, of the volunteers, of the staff, and continue to humble them and reveal yourself to them.
[time=981] God, in a way that when they go, they're going with the Holy Spirit like Paul wrote in 1 Thessalonians.
[time=988] And God, I pray for the people who are there, that you will do the same with their hearts.
[time=995] And God, that as we go, that we don't just go with the Holy Spirit, but we go and we find you, you who have preceded us.
[time=1006] God, we love you and we praise you.
[time=1010] And God, I just pray that you have prompt the heart of each person here today to say, "You know what?
[time=1018] I'll pray every day for the next seven years. I'll pray for this."
[time=1025] I'll pray that little hives would be changed, that hearts would be changed, and that a world would be reclaimed for Jesus Christ.
[time=1034] God, we pray these things in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[time=1041] Well, if you're a mom in the room this morning, if you're a mother here, would you stand up just, and we're not going to clap yet.
[time=1048] We're going to clap in just a moment, but would you just stand right where you're at?
[time=1051] Go ahead. If you're a mom in the room, young, middle-aged, old, doesn't matter, just stand up right where you are.
[time=1056] All mothers, oh great, okay, stay standing.
[time=1060] We found this about you this morning. We wanted to pass this on.
[time=1064] You know you're a mom when your feet stick to great jelly on the kitchen floor and you don't care.
[time=1070] Pop sickles have become a food staple in your home.
[time=1073] Your favorite television show is a cartoon.
[time=1076] You're so desperate for adult conversation that you spill your guts out to the telemarketer that calls, and he hangs up on you.
[time=1085] Well, you know you're a mom when saliva is your number one cleaning agent. Amen?
[time=1090] You buy cereal with marshmallows, and you count the sprinkles on each kid's cupcake to make sure they're equal.
[time=1096] You hide in the bathroom to be alone. Your kids throw up and you catch it.
[time=1102] We've got some talented mothers in the room.
[time=1105] You find yourself cutting your husband's sandwiches into cute shapes.
[time=1110] Yeah, you know you're a mom when you're up each night till 11 p.m.
[time=1113] vacuuming, dusting, wiping, washing, drying, loading, unloading, shopping, cooking, driving, flushing, ironing, sweeping,
[time=1119] picking up, changing sheets, changing diapers, bathing, helping with homework, paying bills, budgeting, clipping coupons,
[time=1125] folding clothes, putting the bed, dragging out of bed, brushing, chasing, buckling, feeding them, not yourself.
[time=1133] Plus, swinging, playing baseball bike riding, pushing trucks, cuddling dolls, rollerblading, basketball football,
[time=1139] catch bubbles, sprinklers, slides, nature walks, coloring, crafts, jumping rope, plus, raking, trimming, planting, edging.
[time=1147] Man, has this gal have a husband somewhere around? Raking, trimming, planting, edging, mowing, gardening, painting, and walking the dog.
[time=1156] You get up at 5.30 a.m. and you have no time to eat, sleep, drink, or go to the bathroom.
[time=1160] And yet you're still managed in the midst of all of that to gain 10 pounds.
[time=1165] Man, you are truly, seriously, you are truly an amazing group of women.
[time=1174] And we want to just say to all of you, thank you for all that you do.
[time=1177] You may feel as if you don't do it as well as you should.
[time=1180] You may, like the rest of us, feel like you're in process, and we know that's true.
[time=1185] But what you do, all of this and more, it's making a difference.
[time=1189] It has made a difference in the lives of many.
[time=1191] It is today making a difference, and it will make a difference in the lives of those little ones that you are spending time with.
[time=1199] Thank you so very much. The gift that God has given you in their lives and the investment and the deposit of truth that you continue to make is an amazing thing.
[time=1209] Many of you had some good role models.
[time=1212] Others of you didn't. And yet you still, to this day, maintain your diligence and your effort to be the woman and to be the wife that God's called you to be.
[time=1221] And we are so grateful for that. Thank you for all that you do. Keep it up. We love you, and we are appreciative of you.
[time=1228] You can be seated.
[time=1232] Happy, happy Mother's Day, and thanks for all you do.
[time=1240] Well, if you will, open your Bibles to 1 Peter chapter 2. We are going to jump right back in and continue on in our study of this great book, 1 Peter chapter 2.
[time=1249] We find ourselves today at verses 21 through 25.
[time=1254] You know, when I'm having conversations, which I often do, when I have spiritual conversations with seeking friends,
[time=1261] you know, I've got people in my life and they're on a spiritual journey, and oftentimes we'll find ourselves discussing that journey.
[time=1268] And, you know, every once in a while, a seeking friend will kind of just look me in the eye and say something along these lines.
[time=1276] They'll just look at me and say, "Cali, just tell me." Like, what is it about this life that you're leading?
[time=1286] What is it about this faith? You want so badly for me to embrace. What is it about following Christ that is so inviting and so amazing?
[time=1296] I mean, why are you so excited about it?
[time=1299] And I want you to see how, in my answer, I'm so predisposed towards certain things and how we so oftentimes avoid other things.
[time=1307] You see, because in my mind, when they ask me that question, I immediately begin to want to talk to them and paint a picture for them of, say, forgiveness.
[time=1318] I want to begin to describe to them the utter joy and beauty of being forgiven.
[time=1324] I'll say, "You have no idea what it's like. Oh, to be absolutely and completely and thoroughly and eternally forgiven is an amazing thing.
[time=1333] And then I'll tell them in on top of the forgiveness that you receive that comes with this amazing power by the grace of God in relationship with Christ to actually forgive others.
[time=1345] And I'll paint a picture of forgiveness.
[time=1347] Or in my mind, I may go to peace. I want to begin to describe to them what it means to actually literally have peace.
[time=1357] You see, because so many of them on this journey, so many of the ones you know and I know still searching, don't have it.
[time=1366] They live lives filled with fear. They live lives filled with uncertainty. They live in this fallen world with just a sense in their spirit that things aren't right and they don't know what to do about it.
[time=1384] And so I paint a picture for them of the peace that surpasses all comprehension.
[time=1390] It's an incredible privilege. And what a picture that is. I want to talk to them about forgiveness and peace. I'll talk to them about real meaning and purpose in life.
[time=1402] I'll just, I'll begin to describe for them what it's like to actually get out of bed every morning with something bigger, something beyond yourself to live for and give yourself to.
[time=1412] I'll begin to paint a picture of what it means to really live life in a way where you get to bring glory and honor to God.
[time=1420] A life beyond a paycheck, a life beyond appearance, a life beyond peers and the pressure that comes from them, a life beyond your vocation, a life of meaning.
[time=1432] I'll paint pictures like this when they ask me that question, but rarely do I say to them. Rarely do I say to them, but most of all, most of all, you get to suffer.
[time=1449] Have you answered it that way lately? Most of all, boy, I've been waiting all day to tell you this, you get to suffer in this life of Christianity. We just don't think that way.
[time=1462] And even though many of us in the room this morning know what the Bible says about suffering, we treat it and act as if somehow it is to be avoided.
[time=1471] Many of us in the room this morning, we think that somehow it is an intrusion. We view it as an interruption in this Christian life of blessing and happiness that he's called us to.
[time=1485] We're actually puzzled. We act shocked and surprised by its presence, wondering how it got in and most importantly when it's going to leave.
[time=1499] Well, you know what, Peter himself, in this very book that we're studying, a few chapters down the road, we'll get there in a few weeks, but I want to just kind of take a peek ahead.
[time=1508] He answers this very issue. You're being, you and I being puzzled, you and I being surprised, you and I somehow being shocked at the presence of suffering.
[time=1522] Look what he says in 1 Peter 4, go a few chapters down the road, 1 Peter 4, 12.
[time=1528] 1 Peter 4, 12. He just comes out and says it. He says, "Beloved, do not be what?" Say it.
[time=1535] Don't be surprised. Don't be puzzled. Don't be shocked. He says, "Don't be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing.
[time=1547] Don't act as though. Don't think in your mind. Don't have this mentality that thinks that somehow it says as though some strange thing were happening to you. Don't be surprised."
[time=1563] And in our passage this morning back in chapter 2, we see that not only is our aversion to suffering or our attempt to escape it futile, but in fact we see that God, listen, my friends, God calls us to it.
[time=1581] He calls you and I as believers to suffer. It's part of the journey he leads us on, suffering for the Christ follower is and should be viewed as normative to some degree, not the exception.
[time=1599] It's not an issue of avoiding it. God's word teaches us that it's a question of how you'll move through it and how you and I can move through with hope, how you and I can move through it with the promises of God ever before us, how you and I can in the midst of suffering actually get up and walk through a day with a sense of peace and a sense of joy and a sense of contentment.
[time=1623] The fact that it's inevitable does not give those of you in the room prone towards spiritual eorism.
[time=1631] You've watched Winnie the Pooh, right? You know who eor is. How you doing? Fine, I guess. How's life? Okay, hard. Not much you can do.
[time=1642] You've met him. You know him. It may be you. No, this is not carte blanche. Just go down the wallowing in suffering road.
[time=1651] It is an opportunity for you and I to face the inevitability of it and to move through it by God's design.
[time=1661] Well, let's go to our passage. Would you stand this morning? In honor of God's word, allow me to read it to you if I can, 1 Peter 2, verses 21 to 25.
[time=1670] "For you have been called," it says, "for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps, who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth, and while being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[time=1691] While suffering, he uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously, and he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[time=1707] For by his wounds you were what healed, for you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls."
[time=1722] Would you pray with me? With your heads bowed and your eyes closed, I am reminded of the words of the psalmist in Psalm 71.
[time=1732] And may this be our prayer this morning, in you, O Lord, I have taken refuge. Let me never be ashamed.
[time=1742] In your righteousness God deliver me, and rescue me, incline your ear to me, and save me.
[time=1749] Be to me a rock of habitation to which I may continually come, you have given commandment, God, to save me.
[time=1757] For you are my rock and my fortress, rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the wrongdoer, and ruthless man.
[time=1768] For you, God, are my hope. O Lord, God, you are my confidence from my youth.
[time=1774] By you I have been sustained from my birth.
[time=1778] You are he who took me from my mother's womb. My praise is continually before you.
[time=1787] Father, God, we pray this morning, many in the room, today, Lord, in the midst of suffering, of some kind, some form or fashion.
[time=1796] God, we pray that you would be our rock. We know you are our redeemer, our fortress, our strong tower.
[time=1804] And as we seek refuge in you, God at the same time, please strengthen us to respond in a way, to face all that is before us in a way that would bring great glory and great honor to you.
[time=1818] God, lift our spirits, open our eyes. May the Word of God and the Spirit of God this morning do a mighty work, where it's in your Son's precious name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1830] You can be seated.
[time=1832] Well, we see in our passage this morning, let me just show you at the beginning, and then we'll work our way through.
[time=1837] We see three things. If you're taking notes this morning, just write these down.
[time=1840] We're going to see three very important truths in our passage this morning as it relates to suffering in a way that would honor God.
[time=1847] He exemplifies number one. He exemplifies suffering.
[time=1852] Number two, he himself experienced ultimate suffering. We'll look at that, and then thirdly, he encourages those suffering.
[time=1861] Let's begin with number one. He exemplifies suffering.
[time=1866] He exemplifies suffering. Look what it says there in verse 21.
[time=1870] It says, "For you as a believer, you and I as Christ followers, for you have been called for this purpose."
[time=1877] What purpose? Well, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps.
[time=1887] In other words, friends, he has left you and I with a set of directions.
[time=1892] He has made it very clear. He has made it possible for you and I to walk this road of difficulty and heartache.
[time=1900] Whenever that may come, whenever suffering rears, it's said God has given you and I a set of directions
[time=1906] so that we could not in some way miss out on the suffering.
[time=1911] No, but instead learn how by virtue of his design to suffer well, to move through it.
[time=1919] Now, question for you. Can you or I, can we follow in his steps?
[time=1924] He has left an example of how to suffer. Can you and I follow in his steps perfectly?
[time=1930] Can we follow just like Jesus suffered? Can we model ourselves after him completely? Yes or no?
[time=1939] No, we can't. He did it perfectly. And I know it's a high bar, but he calls you and I to a mindset.
[time=1946] He calls you and I to an effort. An effort he will help.
[time=1950] He calls you and I to pursue that example, that model.
[time=1954] There are features, if you will, parts of his suffering that do allow an opportunity for you and I to follow.
[time=1961] Chances for us in our difficulty and heartache to have a Christ-like response.
[time=1966] And yes, it's true. You answered the question well. You're not going to hang on a cross. I know that.
[time=1972] Nobody in this room is going to endure an unjust, savage, heartless beating and die in a complete breach of justice for the salvation of the entire world.
[time=1982] But you won't do that, but maybe, maybe, you're married to a man who loves his job and his hobbies more than you.
[time=2000] Maybe you're in the room this morning and you're married to a woman who regardless of your efforts is truly never satisfied.
[time=2012] And though you as a husband would never think to compare your pain to the pain our Lord endured,
[time=2018] there are times that her ongoing criticisms and her harsh demeaning words tear into you like a beating.
[time=2030] Yeah, maybe you're not going to hang on a cross, but maybe there's a neighbor who despises your faith.
[time=2040] Maybe there's a coach who has no respect for your values.
[time=2044] Maybe there's a father, mother or grandparent that literally seems to thrive on and enjoy mistreating you and your family.
[time=2054] And you see in these everyday experiences and in scenarios just like them, you and I find ourselves having to respond.
[time=2067] We find ourselves as followers of Christ needing to respond, needing to live out our faith in the midst of this, whatever that might be.
[time=2077] And thank God that our Lord exemplifies.
[time=2083] Thank God that our Lord left you and I some directions to follow.
[time=2088] He exemplifies for us that very response that you and I are to have.
[time=2094] And though the bar is high, he gives us some very practical help to follow.
[time=2099] And you see that practical help right there in your text, to go to verse 22 and 23, who committed no sin.
[time=2107] Who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth.
[time=2111] And while being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[time=2116] While suffering, he uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself.
[time=2125] We'll get to that statement in just a moment, but I'll tell you what, if you're one who writes in your Bible and if you don't, it's fine.
[time=2131] But if you do, I'd underline that statement.
[time=2134] I'd put a note next to that statement.
[time=2136] I put a big old dot right there.
[time=2138] You want to do it, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously.
[time=2147] Now let's just be very practical.
[time=2149] What do you say this morning?
[time=2150] Let's just ask some questions and try and give some answers that might move us along in this process.
[time=2155] Might get us to think about and actually engage with some of these principles at a level that might really do you and I some good.
[time=2163] Let me ask you this question.
[time=2164] When you, as a husband or wife, this could be in the marriage arena.
[time=2169] Again, this could be with a neighbor.
[time=2171] This could be with a guy down the block.
[time=2173] This could be with a coach.
[time=2174] This could be with a co-worker.
[time=2175] This could be with anybody.
[time=2176] Is there anybody who's liable to come at you?
[time=2179] Anybody's liable to be that source of pain and discomfort and frustration and hurt.
[time=2187] When you've been reviled, here's question number one.
[time=2190] When you have been reviled, do you revile back?
[time=2195] Now, some of you might be thinking, "Well, wait a minute.
[time=2198] Time out.
[time=2199] Could you help me with the whole revile thing?
[time=2200] I'm not sure if I've been reviled." What does it mean to be reviled?
[time=2204] Great question.
[time=2205] The word revile there in the text means this.
[time=2208] It means to be talked to in a harsh and abusive fashion.
[time=2214] It is a demeaning comment.
[time=2217] It is a way of speaking that seeks to tear apart, bring under, tear down, discourage and diminish.
[time=2226] To be reviled is to have someone say things to you that are heartless and mean and cruel and cutting.
[time=2234] It might be a word.
[time=2235] It might be a statement.
[time=2237] It could be a paragraph.
[time=2242] But the idea here is that it's been said and the other idea in the text is that it has been said again and again and again.
[time=2249] They didn't revile him once.
[time=2252] They reviled him often that day and even in his years of ministry.
[time=2258] So the question for you and I is when you have been reviled, do you revile back?
[time=2265] And see, I know you because I know me.
[time=2270] And the answer to that question is too many times.
[time=2273] What?
[time=2274] Yes.
[time=2275] It is just such a part of our human sinful makeup, isn't it?
[time=2284] You know, you're such a jerk.
[time=2288] Well, you know what?
[time=2289] No, no, no.
[time=2290] You're such a jerk.
[time=2293] You know, I can't stand it when you, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, wall.
[time=2299] I can't, you can't stand it when I, you know what?
[time=2302] I can't stand it when you, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[time=2307] When are you ever going to grow up?
[time=2308] Me?
[time=2309] When am I going?
[time=2310] When are you?
[time=2311] We just, we had law back and forth.
[time=2312] The bomb comes over the bow.
[time=2314] We pick up the bomb and we, what?
[time=2316] Throw it back.
[time=2317] We're just throwing bombs back and forth all the time, aren't we?
[time=2322] Kids do it.
[time=2323] Adults do it.
[time=2324] Husbands and wives do it.
[time=2325] Co-workers do it.
[time=2326] They say something to you.
[time=2328] You're going to say something back.
[time=2334] And sometimes it's out of pride and arrogance and sometimes on this suffering topic it's, it's because we think somehow throwing it back is going to relieve the suffering.
[time=2343] It's going to make you feel what?
[time=2345] Better.
[time=2346] Does it make you feel better for about two seconds and then you and I realize all it's just made things what?
[time=2354] When reviled, he did not revile in return.
[time=2359] He didn't fire back.
[time=2365] Moms and dads, moms, dads, we, we have got some work to do.
[time=2372] You and I live in a culture where, where our kids are growing up in a society where not only is it tolerated, it's encouraged.
[time=2382] Kids are applauded for the style with which they can fire back.
[time=2388] And you can call it smack, you can call it whatever you want to call it.
[time=2391] Kids today are encouraged to have the creative and cutting response that can level the person
[time=2398] verbally because of what they've said or done.
[time=2404] Husbands and wives.
[time=2406] You and I know it continues to take place.
[time=2413] Jesus could have, you know, I was thinking about this back to our ultimate example.
[time=2417] I was thinking about all the reviling that was being thrown on him.
[time=2423] All the abusive, demeaning, degrading comments that they threw at him.
[time=2430] And I was just thinking about how, I'll go to Isaiah 53-7, just take note there, hundreds
[time=2438] and hundreds of years before it ever happened.
[time=2440] The prophets spoke to this very scene.
[time=2444] And while being, go to, go to Isaiah 53-7, you'll see it here on the screen.
[time=2448] He was, speaking of the Christ, it says, he was oppressed and he was afflicted.
[time=2454] He did not open his what, say it, like a lamb that has led to slaughter and like a sheet
[time=2461] that is silent before its shears.
[time=2464] So he did not open his what, say it.
[time=2467] Mouth.
[time=2469] I was thinking about it this week.
[time=2470] He could have just, he could have just in one, he could have just in one word.
[time=2475] All he had to say, and I don't even know what it would have been, but all he would have had to have done is looked at one of these guys, looked at this group over here with just one word, he could have just, boom, gone.
[time=2487] He could have brought retribution, boom, one word, just open his mouth, real quick, close it, over, vengeance is his.
[time=2496] Just one word, but he wouldn't open his what, say it, wouldn't open his mouth.
[time=2503] He knew what you and I forget that in those situations there is most every time a greater
[time=2511] purpose and a greater opportunity.
[time=2514] We talked about it last week.
[time=2516] He knew in every suffering situation there was an opportunity for ministry and he kept
[time=2523] his mouth shut.
[time=2527] While being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[time=2531] While suffering go on in our text, while suffering he uttered no threats, stop there.
[time=2540] That phrase, that phrase there, it says, while suffering, that's a present, we don't usually get real deep into the Greek, into the original language, but every time I come across something
[time=2552] where I feel like it would be helpful for you, I'll share it with you.
[time=2555] I just want you to know that while suffering is a present active participle, it talks about an ongoing and continuous action.
[time=2563] He had been suffering.
[time=2565] This was not a one time deal.
[time=2567] He was suffering.
[time=2568] He had been suffering.
[time=2569] He was suffering.
[time=2570] It was continuing.
[time=2574] It was ongoing.
[time=2576] It was relentless.
[time=2578] While suffering, present active participle, he uttered how many threats, say it.
[time=2585] None.
[time=2586] Not even, not even just one.
[time=2593] Do you ever get to the point?
[time=2595] I'll ask you.
[time=2597] And you and I know the answer.
[time=2599] But do you ever get to the point where, and we do this pretty well, in our hearts and
[time=2606] in our minds, and I do this too, we face some suffering.
[time=2612] Something happens.
[time=2613] Something is done.
[time=2614] Something has said, and everything kind of starts to go south, and it's difficult, and it's disheartening, but we stand there before God, and we say, "Okay, God, I'm yours.
[time=2624] I'll endure this as best I can.
[time=2625] You teach me what you want to teach me.
[time=2627] I know you are sovereign.
[time=2629] I'm yours.
[time=2631] You go.
[time=2632] Do your thing.
[time=2633] I'm going to follow you." And I think somewhere back in our minds, we think, and we may not say this, but we kind of way back in the back think that if we say that and take that posture, he'll be pleased by that and go a little easier on us, maybe.
[time=2648] And then what happens is as we maintain that posture, the suffering doesn't go away.
[time=2652] Whatever it is.
[time=2654] It keeps going, and we come before God again, we say, "Hey, God, I'm still here, and I'm still waiting." But you know what?
[time=2661] This is getting very, very uncomfortable.
[time=2663] God, I need you to move here quickly because I can't do this anymore, and see then what happens is the suffering continues, and we do a really good job.
[time=2672] You and I have arbitrarily kind of just raising our hand and saying, "You know what, God?
[time=2677] I'm at the end of my rope." You see, and we forget it's not about our rope, it's about his rope, and his rope is really long, and ours tends to be a little shorter.
[time=2687] We raise our hands arbitrarily and say, "You know what, God?
[time=2690] I'm done.
[time=2691] I'm sorry.
[time=2692] I'm going to have to boom, and boom, the threats come out.
[time=2697] I've been patient, I've endured, now it's time to throw out a nice criticism-laced threat
[time=2704] to get him or to get her or to get them to stop doing whatever they're doing, or else they're going to pay for it." Because I am now threatening, which means taking matters into my own what, hands.
[time=2721] Have you threatened in any way your husband lately?
[time=2725] Have you threatened your wife in some way?
[time=2731] Have you decided in your own heart that enough's enough?
[time=2735] And have you just kind of stepped forward and said whatever it was you felt like you had to say to bring an end to what was so confusing?
[time=2744] If you have, then you, like me, have learned that oftentimes again, that really only makes
[time=2751] matters worse, because he's not on your time frame, is he?
[time=2760] Whether it's your spouse, a mean-spirited neighbor, an unsensitive mother or father, is it okay to take matters into your own hands?
[time=2768] Well, he didn't, and I want you to see this, boy, I love how this text unfolds.
[time=2775] While being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[time=2778] While suffering, he uttered no threats.
[time=2781] Well, you're sitting there thinking, "How in the world do you expect me to do that?"
[time=2788] He calls you to do that, and he lets you know, and I know, the one way that happens is when
[time=2795] you and I are willing to entrust our situation, to entrust our lives, to entrust the pain and
[time=2802] heartache and discomfort.
[time=2803] It's right there in the text, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously.
[time=2811] Again, here, the Greek is helpful.
[time=2814] Perididu, p-e-r-i-d-i-d-o-u, perididu, entrusting, it means to commit or hand over.
[time=2822] Remember that.
[time=2823] It means to commit completely, to hand over thoroughly everything, to say, "There, it is all yours, everything I have.
[time=2832] I give to you.
[time=2833] I give you this situation, all of its what-ifs, all of the it's not fairs, all of the injustice.
[time=2840] I give it all to you.
[time=2842] I entrust myself to you."
[time=2848] And it was only in the perididu.
[time=2850] It was only in the entrusting that he's able to not fire back, not out of the threat.
[time=2860] In other words, with each new wave of mistreatment, with each new onslaught of unfair, unjust
[time=2866] abuse, Jesus was always perididu there, the entrusting.
[time=2872] Look at it there in your text, it's in the imperfect tense, past, present, future tenses,
[time=2878] and the imperfect tense, all that means for you today is this, it is a past action that is repeated.
[time=2885] He had to keep doing it again and again and again because my friends, that's how suffering is.
[time=2892] Suffering calls you and I to lead you and I to and again and again and again type of
[time=2898] entrusting.
[time=2900] He was always handing himself over to God.
[time=2906] Think about it.
[time=2907] He kept entrusting himself.
[time=2910] He kept handing himself over to him to the very end.
[time=2915] It says it so well in Luke 23.
[time=2918] You can write that down, Luke 2346, what an amazing picture.
[time=2924] Look where it led our Lord.
[time=2926] It says in Luke 2346 in Jesus on the cross towards the end, crying out with a loud voice,
[time=2932] said Father, into your hands I what, perididu, into your hands I commit my spirit.
[time=2944] You see it right there and having said this, he breathed his last.
[time=2948] He had been doing that all along and he did that until the very end.
[time=2953] Let me ask you again, I asked you last week, I'm going to ask you again today, my friends, who will eventually write all wrongs, you or God, say it louder, who can use your willingness
[time=2967] to suffer well, to soften the hardest heart, who, God, who has proven himself worthy of
[time=2975] your trust again and again and again, say it loud, God, that's right.
[time=2982] Now it's important to note here, very important that we just say this.
[time=2988] If what you're facing, if the heartache and trial, if the suffering that you've come upon has to do with physical violence, if it has to do with sexual abuse, if what we're
[time=3001] talking about is a level of abuse, of that nature, of that scope, then it would be very,
[time=3009] very important for you to say something.
[time=3014] Very, very important for you to ask for help, very, very important for you to not confuse in that case an enduring spirit with wisdom or nobility, no, in those situations you would
[time=3025] need to ask for help.
[time=3028] It also doesn't mean that if you're a wife or a husband in a merit situation and there's reviling going on, there's things being said that shouldn't be said, there's things being
[time=3040] done that shouldn't be done, it may not fall under physical abuse or sexual misconduct,
[time=3046] but it's sin.
[time=3049] This not reviling back, it doesn't mean that you can't as a wife or as a husband lovingly
[time=3055] gracefully confront.
[time=3058] You and I need to be willing to do that, to lovingly and gracefully say what might need to be said, not in a reviling manner, but in a soft and gentle manner, giving that spouse
[time=3069] the opportunity to repent and move toward that which is right.
[time=3075] He is our example and he leaves you and I with a path we can walk.
[time=3080] He experienced ultimate suffering, number two, write that down.
[time=3084] He experienced ultimate suffering, don't forget that as you think about your relationship
[time=3090] with him and your journey through suffering, think of who's going through that journey with you, verse 24, and he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we
[time=3102] might die to sin and live to righteousness, for by his wounds you were healed.
[time=3109] I think the important truth here, for you to note, for you to write down for us to see in this verse just before we move on here, the important truth here is that he suffered more in this one act of substitutionary death than anyone ever has or ever will.
[time=3125] He bore, this is very significant, he bore our sins, the Texas.
[time=3134] My friends, that means he suffered the pain and penalty of all the sins of all those who could ever be forgiven and he not only suffered physical death in his body, but he endured
[time=3145] as well the unspeakable, horrific truth of spiritual separation from the Father, a separation
[time=3153] that he had never experienced.
[time=3156] From all eternity past he had been closely knit in the Godhead, in the Father's Son and Holy Spirit, and for that moment he has ripped apart from God.
[time=3165] Physically, yes, he suffers spiritually, he has separated from God, all of it so that
[time=3172] he could take the full punishment for your sin, all of it so that he could suffer, so
[time=3181] God's justice would be satisfied so that I could be and you could be forgiven.
[time=3187] Now listen, what he did cannot be duplicated, listen, how he did it, the manner in which
[time=3196] he conducted himself, the things he said and the things he didn't say, his posture, his
[time=3202] spirit, that's what you and I can move toward, that's what you and I can begin to embrace
[time=3211] and this morning we see here in our text two very practical ways, that you and I would not revile back and that you and I would not be threatening people, but instead that we
[time=3222] would be people who entrust ourselves completely to him.
[time=3229] Well, we're out of time, let me ask you to write this down, would you?
[time=3232] Just get your pen out and write these three things down, three things I want you to see about God honoring suffering, three very important truths about God honoring suffering
[time=3241] before we move on from this text into chapter three next week.
[time=3247] Write this down, God honoring suffering, number one, God honoring suffering grows your faith.
[time=3254] You see that?
[time=3255] Go to James chapter one if you would, just turn back over a few pages to the left from first Peter.
[time=3261] Go to James chapter one, I want you to see and be reminded this morning that when you and I are willing to suffer in a way that honors God, our faith is grown.
[time=3271] It's not easy, oftentimes it's not quick, but nonetheless it is one of, not the only, but one of the ways God chooses to grow your faith, consider it all joy, my brothers,
[time=3282] when you encounter various trials, there's the suffering, knowing that the testing of your faith, there's the suffering, produces what, say it, endurance, and let endurance,
[time=3295] this thing that comes out of the suffering, the endurance, he says, let it, let it have,
[time=3301] it's perfect result, it's an active thing this endurance is.
[time=3305] Let it have, it's perfect result so that you may be perfect and complete lacking in nothing,
[time=3312] God chooses.
[time=3314] He allows the trials to come into your life and mind and through those trials, your faith,
[time=3320] your trust, your willingness and readiness to paradidu, to give it all completely to
[time=3326] him and follow him as best you can, no matter how windy or steep the road might be.
[time=3334] When you suffer well, your faith is grown.
[time=3341] Number two, write this down, when you suffer well, God honoring suffering grows the faith of others.
[time=3347] Would you write that down?
[time=3348] It grows the faith of others.
[time=3350] What do I mean by that?
[time=3351] Well, just simply stated, just simply stated.
[time=3356] There were 11, listen, there were 11 men who watched, there were 11 men who watched him
[time=3363] die on that hill.
[time=3367] They had lost one that day, but there were 11 men who watched him suffer well.
[time=3373] They watched and listened to not one word coming back.
[time=3377] They watched and they listened to no threats and they then were encouraged.
[time=3384] They then were envisioned.
[time=3386] They then by the grace of God planted the church and changed the then-known world.
[time=3394] See when you suffer well, it not only grows your faith, but it grows and challenges and
[time=3401] encourages others.
[time=3405] Many of you know how I feel about my mother and all I watched her experience in her life.
[time=3411] You know people in your life who you've watched go through things that others would have buckled under, and yet they stayed by the grace and strength of God strong, and you were challenged
[time=3422] and encouraged by that.
[time=3427] Grows your faith, it helps grow the faith of others.
[time=3431] I have friends in this family.
[time=3432] I have friends here in this room, and as I watch them endure, as I see you, not try
[time=3439] and avoid it, not try and escape it, but as I watch you get up each day and beg God for
[time=3446] the strength and mercy to continue through that which He has allowed you inspire me.
[time=3453] And He uses that to help grow others.
[time=3455] Number three, write this down.
[time=3457] God honoring suffering only happens.
[time=3459] You are only going to do it that way in close proximity to Him.
[time=3465] Would you write that down?
[time=3466] Let me read you what it says in Hebrews 4.
[time=3468] Saw this just this morning.
[time=3471] Hebrews 4 says in Hebrews 4, 15, "For we do not have a high priest, Jesus, who cannot
[time=3479] sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are
[time=3486] yet without sin." Therefore, verse 16, "Let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that
[time=3496] we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need." You see that?
[time=3504] He's been through your suffering.
[time=3506] He knows what that trial feels like.
[time=3510] And when you're willing to draw near to Him, not move away from Him because you're mad, because you don't get it, because you don't like the fact that His timeframe isn't yours.
[time=3520] You don't appreciate the fact that what He's allowed is best for you.
[time=3525] You think otherwise, and so you sometimes, and I sometimes go the other way, no, no, no.
[time=3529] God's Word says draw near because it's when you're near to Him in relationship with Him
[time=3537] that He's able to give you the grace and mercy needed in your time of need.
[time=3544] He understands exactly what it's like, and He knows exactly what to give you.
[time=3555] God's Word says, "Let us draw near to Him."
[time=3585] God's Word says, "Let us draw near to Him in relationship with Him."
[time=3601] God says, "Let us draw near to Him in relationship with Him in relationship with Him."
