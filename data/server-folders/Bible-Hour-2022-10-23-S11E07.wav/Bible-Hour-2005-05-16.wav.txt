[time=301] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=305] This morning we're going to begin a series within a series.
[time=308] We've been teaching in 1 Peter.
[time=310] Now chapter three comes to a section on husbands and wives and how to treat each other in response to God.
[time=317] We'll get to that in a minute, but I'd like to encourage you to think about showing up here at Blackhawk on June 5th.
[time=324] We have a special family Sunday.
[time=326] It's one service.
[time=327] Dr. Bill Brown will be here.
[time=329] He's the president of Cedarville University.
[time=332] He'll be here to speak that night at the Blackhawk Christian School graduation, but also here in the morning June 5th for our family Sunday.
[time=340] Consider joining us for that.
[time=341] It's a good day.
[time=342] Then also I'd like to encourage you men.
[time=344] Think about coming to Blackhawk this summer, every other Thursday, beginning June 9th, 6.30 in the morning, or 5.30 in the afternoon.
[time=354] They're both the same thing for leaning into a hail of bullets.
[time=358] It's a study we're going to be doing to try to help men think through the issues of life and how they're supposed to respond to those.
[time=365] I really encourage you to come.
[time=366] Beginning June 9th, that's Thursday morning at 6.30, or Thursday afternoon at 5.30, every other week, all summer.
[time=375] Well, this message this morning is particularly to women, but it's about being submissive, and that's true for all of us.
[time=383] Being submissive first to God, men and women both, and then willing to accept their roles as husbands and wives, and particularly this morning, we're talking about the wives' people as a submissive person, in particular to a husband, who is not a believer.
[time=399] The Bible says that she sets him apart when she liked by her quietness and her reverence out of fear of the Lord, and love, and submission to God the Father, she submits to a husband.
[time=412] And we hope you'll learn what you need to learn here.
[time=415] It's a tough subject for a lot of people, but it's about all of us being submissive. In particular, for wives, submissive to their husbands this morning.
[time=449] [MUSIC]
[time=479] [singing]
[time=525] [singing] [singing] [singing]
[time=542] [singing]
[time=576] Every corner of creation is a living declaration.
[time=580] Come join the song we were made to sing.
[time=584] Wake the neighbors, get word out.
[time=589] Come on, bring up the music, find our mountains and shout.
[time=594] This is life we've been given, made to be lived out.
[time=599] So, la, la, la, la, live out loud, get word out.
[time=606] Come on, bring up the music, find our mountains and shout.
[time=611] This is life we've been given, made to be lived out.
[time=616] So la, la, la, live out loud, get word out loud, get word out loud.

[time=669] [singing]
[time=713] I will the purpose of my will is to do your will instead.
[time=734] And I pray that I'll always follow as you guide me through what's ahead.
[time=744] I will the purpose of my will is to do your will instead.
[time=754] I saw the vision of my soul is to live with you someday.
[time=779] It could be in a hundred years or it could start today.
[time=793] I saw the vision of my soul, I will the purpose of my will.
[time=803] My heart, the longing of my heart is to love you more.
[time=815] [MUSIC]
[time=831] Why do we do the things we do, how can we sing?
[time=840] When there seem no reason to, how do we smile?
[time=847] When there's not much to smile about, when the world is down?
[time=854] Who are we to stand and shout, and they wonder why we do the things we do?
[time=865] It's all because of this, it's all because of this.
[time=886] We taste it fast, taste it home, taste it home again.
[time=894] [MUSIC]
[time=899] They wonder why we do the things we do.
[time=907] [MUSIC]
[time=912] Hi, I'm Mitch.
[time=914] I'm a teaching pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and with me is a man I love, another teaching pastor at Blackhawk, and he is.
[time=923] Yeah, I'm Steve.
[time=926] That's not me, you know, that's Mitch.
[time=929] And you have an announcement?
[time=931] I do.
[time=933] You know, what we're going to be speaking on this morning, and what God's word has to say about women, the labels loaded with what our roles are supposed to be,
[time=943] and we get a chance today to talk about submission, and I'd like for all the women to submit by being willing to fill out a survey next week.
[time=953] Our women's ministry, Tammy Crane and all of her leaders are putting together a survey
[time=959] that they'd really like for you to fill out next Sunday, the 22nd.
[time=963] There'll also be some folks in the Commons, there's a reception area down there, you can go down there and spend some time and find out some things there, but please take time next week to fill out the survey.
[time=973] We're committed to our women, and we want to find out what would best help you.
[time=978] So please take time next week to do that.
[time=981] And now, we need to take time to teach this passage of Scripture.
[time=986] Well, we're in a series of First Peter called when holiness meets hostility.
[time=993] And if you haven't recognized in the last few weeks, we've been talking a lot about submission.
[time=999] Well, we're kicking off kind of a little series within a series today, called marital submission in Christ.
[time=1005] Marital submission in Christ.
[time=1008] First Peter 3, 1 through 6 will be focused on women,
[time=1014] and then first 7 will be on men.
[time=1019] And Kelly will pick up the next two weeks, we get the lovely opportunity to talk about something we know so much about.
[time=1028] And today's message is entitled...
[time=1034] Well, most people didn't want it to be titled this,
[time=1040] but when I think about submission, you know, what it really is, it's not about you reacting and making some choices, it's about the essence of who you are as a woman.
[time=1050] And that made me think of herbal essence for some reason, that shampoo.
[time=1056] And then, because it's about you winning your husband over without words, I thought, you know, like the rhyming word to herbal would be non-verbal essence.
[time=1066] I think it's a good title.
[time=1068] Kelly and Mitchell didn't like it.
[time=1070] Who likes it?
[time=1073] Who does it like it?
[time=1076] Okay, I understand.
[time=1079] The non-verbal essence.
[time=1081] We were going to can it, and so I go into three women in an office who were all part of the process, and I said, okay, we're going to change the title to some real simple thing I had, and they said, oh, I said what?
[time=1096] Oh, it was so mysterious, and we wanted to learn more about it.
[time=1101] Steve, they like it, you're always in touch with women, you know, so that's why we went with it.
[time=1108] And I want to start today with a story.
[time=1111] This is 1 Peter 3, 1 through 2, we'll be talking about today.
[time=1115] Susan, my wife, and I have always had a tradition at Christmas time.
[time=1119] On Christmas Eve, we go to Waterloo and celebrate Christmas.
[time=1123] You're laughing at Waterloo.
[time=1125] And we celebrate Christmas with our family.
[time=1128] I guess there's now my family.
[time=1129] And we come home, get all the girls in bed, and we have our Christmas that night by the tree ourselves.
[time=1140] And then we used to sleep on an air mattress by the tree, and we argue about who ended the tradition.
[time=1148] But we have another tradition which we want to talk to you about, and that's that morning before the girls are all around, we get out our stockings and we share our stocking stuffers for each other, okay?
[time=1163] Well, this year, I was at Mike's car wash, and I thought, "That'll be great!" We drive all the time, we like our cars to be clean, they fit so nicely in the stocking stuffer, I'll get her some.
[time=1178] So I'm pulling in, getting my car washed, and the guy said, "Hey, I want to buy one of those packets where you get one free or two free or whatever it is." And he goes, "Which would you like?" Cheap, medium expensive.
[time=1195] He didn't say that.
[time=1196] No, he didn't know.
[time=1197] But that's what I heard, okay? That's what I heard.
[time=1200] It might surprise you.
[time=1203] I chose cheap.
[time=1206] It doesn't surprise you, oh my god.
[time=1210] It's how I choose cheap.
[time=1212] Alright, Christmas 2004, Christmas morning.
[time=1216] We share our stocking stuffers, we hope you know how they got the red box, we open them up, you know how they're in there.
[time=1221] Okay.
[time=1223] Couple days later, I'm going to go get my car wash.
[time=1227] Susan, I can't find the car wash certificates.
[time=1232] She goes, "Well, why don't you just take mine, the ones you got me?" They're sitting on my seat in the car in the garage.
[time=1241] They're the same, right?
[time=1244] I go through mics, I do my thing, and I got what I bought, right?
[time=1249] Because I'm using the ones that I bought her.
[time=1252] That night, Susan needed a car wash and we were out in her car.
[time=1256] She likes to drive.
[time=1258] And we go through mics.
[time=1262] And all of a sudden, to my amazement, I see juices and colors I've never seen before.
[time=1269] And I smell smells I've never seen before.
[time=1272] And all this stuff starts happening in the car.
[time=1274] You can't see it.
[time=1275] You can't see smells.
[time=1277] Okay. Smells I've never smelled before.
[time=1279] Okay. Did I say C?
[time=1281] Yeah.
[time=1283] Okay. Oh, that's awesome.
[time=1285] All this stuff didn't happen to me that morning.
[time=1288] There's a verse in Proverbs that says, "Even a fool is thought-wise if he would just keep silent."
[time=1297] I spoke.
[time=1299] And out of my mouth said, "What is this?
[time=1303] What is happening?
[time=1304] What is this?" And I wanted to get the words back because I had purchased Susan the cheap.
[time=1314] And I got the cheap.
[time=1316] Susan purchased for me the expensive.
[time=1319] And she got the expensive.
[time=1322] You know, each of us received what we gave.
[time=1327] Each of us had returned our investment.
[time=1331] Each of us reaped what we sold.
[time=1337] But I sat there in Mike's car wash convicted of my wife's behavior toward me.
[time=1347] Not a word was said from her.
[time=1351] And I was convicted of her behavior toward me.
[time=1356] And that's what we're going to talk about today.
[time=1358] The submissive heart of a woman can be so attractive to her husband without words but with her behavior.
[time=1371] And he will follow suit.
[time=1373] So guess what?
[time=1375] Invest Christ, receive Christ.
[time=1387] And that's what happened.
[time=1389] So we're going to talk about that today.
[time=1391] And we're going to see that submission, a submissive heart, is heartfelt.
[time=1396] Not manufactured.
[time=1399] It's from the inside out.
[time=1401] It's heartfelt.
[time=1402] We're going to see that it's influential, not manipulative.
[time=1408] And we're going to see that it's sincere, not make believe.
[time=1413] And it's been Susan's heart and life that has modeled those things that have really moved me.
[time=1420] And so if you could stand, we're going to read 1 Peter 3, 1 through 2, our text for today.
[time=1426] And Steve, would you do the honors?
[time=1428] I will.
[time=1432] Wives, in the same way, be submissive to your husbands.
[time=1437] So that if any of them do not believe the Word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
[time=1452] Let's pray.
[time=1455] Our Father in Heaven, we bow down to you the living God, the author of these words, the God who changes our hearts, the God who makes it possible for women to be with a heartfelt, sincere desire, very influential in their husbands' lives.
[time=1477] And we beg you, please, Lord, to help us learn what it is you want us to learn from your words.
[time=1484] And please help us do what you want us to do that we learn from your Word.
[time=1490] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1493] You may be seated.
[time=1498] Did you trade her back and get the other coupons or did you keep the ones you bought for yourself?
[time=1504] That's confidential.
[time=1505] A fool is thought wise if you keep silent.
[time=1514] The first we're going to see is that submission, submission is heartfelt, not manufactured.
[time=1524] Heart felt not manufactured.
[time=1527] Verse 1 there says, wives in the same way, be submissive to your husbands.
[time=1536] In the same way, that means he's been saying something to us that they need to know about that precedes these verses in order to do it the same way.
[time=1548] So let's look at those.
[time=1550] In verse 13 of chapter 2, it says, submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men.
[time=1561] A few weeks ago we learned how to treat the BMV people, how to be a little sweeter in spirit to them.
[time=1568] And God's really clear.
[time=1571] He wants us to have a submissive spirit when it comes to the arena of governing authority over us.
[time=1581] He makes that very clear in this passage in Romans 13 as well.
[time=1585] Kelly taught us that was great.
[time=1587] And he also says that if we're in a condition of slavery, this is not popular today at all.
[time=1594] But if I was a slave, what God expects me to do as a slave, in verse 18 you see slaves submit yourselves to your masters with all respect.
[time=1604] Not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.
[time=1608] What God wants me to do is have a submissive spirit toward him that then gets exhibited in a submissive spirit
[time=1616] in whatever arena I'm in.
[time=1618] And he says, if the guy beats me, I'm going to be a really good slave.
[time=1623] That's God's expectation of me.
[time=1626] Having a submissive, being submissive rather than reacting in a submissive way, he wants me to be submissive.
[time=1635] In the same way as God wants me to submit to my employer, submit to the governing authorities in that very same way,
[time=1645] God wants wives to submit to their husbands.
[time=1648] And he talks about that and he says in Ephesians 5, we do that in reverence to Christ.
[time=1656] We submit to one another in reverence to Christ, being thoughtful of who Christ is in our relationship with him,
[time=1663] then we do what he asks us to do in the same way.
[time=1667] Verses 21 to 25, explain that to us, it says to this you were called because Christ suffered for you,
[time=1674] leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps.
[time=1677] He committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth.
[time=1680] When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate.
[time=1683] When he suffered, he made no threats.
[time=1685] Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
[time=1689] He himself bore our sins and his body on the tree so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness.
[time=1696] By his wounds you have been healed, for you were like sheep going astray.
[time=1700] But now you are returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.
[time=1706] Like him be submissive.
[time=1709] That's what he says to wives.
[time=1711] In the same way as Christ's example, as Steve just read, be submissive.
[time=1717] The Greek word is hupotasso.
[time=1720] Hupotasso, you are really good at that.
[time=1725] Hupotasso, which literally means to place under.
[time=1729] You want to write that down, to place under.
[time=1731] And it says be submissive.
[time=1733] It's a heart condition and it will directly flow from your heart condition toward Christ.
[time=1740] I read a book by Tony Campolo and it says that a Christian is just characterized and known by submission.
[time=1747] He submits to Christ, he submits to the Father, submits to the Holy Spirit and lives out horizontally submission in relationships.
[time=1755] And it's heartfelt because it's based on a toman of another, on the example of Christ.
[time=1763] And we see this all over the Bible.
[time=1767] There's a direct correlation between the way I submit horizontally to others and the way I submit vertically
[time=1776] to God.
[time=1778] James 4-7.
[time=1780] James 4-7 says submit yourselves then to God.
[time=1786] It's just the way it is.
[time=1788] Place myself under.
[time=1790] It's a heart condition.
[time=1791] I choose to do it.
[time=1793] It's heartfelt, not manufactured.
[time=1797] Philippians 2, 3 through 5 kind of sums the whole thing up for us.
[time=1801] Paul writes, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit.
[time=1806] But in humility consider others including your husband better than yourselves.
[time=1812] Each of you should not look only to your own interests.
[time=1816] That's okay.
[time=1817] You're not a floor mat.
[time=1818] You can speak.
[time=1819] You can talk.
[time=1820] You can share.
[time=1821] You can live life.
[time=1822] So it's okay to know what your own interests are.
[time=1827] But also to the interests of others, and here's the kicker.
[time=1831] Your attitude should be the same as that as Christ Jesus.
[time=1835] Let's look at what Steve referred to in Ephesians 5.
[time=1838] Ephesians 5, when it talks about wives submitting to husbands, begins with this.
[time=1844] A lot of people want to overlook it.
[time=1847] Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[time=1851] We are just known for our submissive hearts.
[time=1856] It's heartfelt, not manufactured.
[time=1860] And we submit to Christ and therefore we submit to others.
[time=1864] And it goes on and it says wives submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
[time=1868] It doesn't mean your husband's God.
[time=1870] He is the picture of the sacrificial heart of Christ in your marriage.
[time=1876] He's submitting as well.
[time=1877] For the husband is the head of the wife.
[time=1879] Head can mean source.
[time=1880] Head might mean a picture of a physical head on a body.
[time=1883] In any case, it's showing you that the picture, that head of the wife, if Christ is the head of the church for his body, which he is the Savior.
[time=1891] It's that self-sacrificial submission back of the husband.
[time=1898] Now we were talking about be submissive.
[time=1901] Let's anchor the scale a little bit.
[time=1903] What's the opposite of being submissive?
[time=1907] And what do we come up with?
[time=1908] Well, obviously people say often rebellion when they think of a characteristic in someone that would be opposite,
[time=1916] a submitted spirit would be a rebellious spirit.
[time=1919] And rebellion can take lots of forms, can it?
[time=1922] One of the ways that rebellion takes a form, and I see this sometimes in marriage, is we have a tendency in all of our relationships to want to gain control.
[time=1931] It doesn't show up necessarily as something really wicked where we're beating on each other.
[time=1936] But if I'm in a position with an authority, I might even in my car, as he's walking up there, think about what it is I'm going to say.
[time=1947] You know what I'm talking about? A couple of you have been there.
[time=1950] He's coming up and you've been stopped and the lights are blinking.
[time=1954] I might be thinking, what is I'm going to, or am I going to just confess the reality that I'm under his authority?
[time=1960] I'm going to try to manipulate him.
[time=1963] So rebellion often comes in the form of taking control in settings where you're not supposed to be in control.
[time=1972] You're supposed to be under authority.
[time=1974] Probably every believing woman here would say, you know, I'm not rebellious.
[time=1979] I'm not rebellious toward my husband at all.
[time=1982] But there's that subtle issue of control that often gets fleshed out in our marriages on both sides.
[time=1988] One biblical example of that, and the story's too long to look at it in its entirety, but it's found in Esther.
[time=1996] And we have Vashti and Esther contrasted by the writer.
[time=2002] And it starts out the King of Persia, King Xerxes.
[time=2004] If you want to write this down, it's Esther 1 verses 10 through 12.
[time=2007] If you want to look at it later, Esther 1 verses 10 through 12.
[time=2011] And it says that King Xerxes was a little influenced by alcohol.
[time=2017] He had a big party going on.
[time=2020] And after like seven days of that, he wants everybody to see how beautiful his queen is.
[time=2025] And he says, you know, bring Vashti and I want everybody to see how beautiful she is.
[time=2030] And she sends a message that will ring in the ears throughout the land that she is rebelling against the King.
[time=2037] And she says, no, absolutely not.
[time=2042] And then this is so interesting. In Esther 2 verses 15 through 17, we see this all-out search for a new queen, all-out search.
[time=2053] And you get all these beautiful women together.
[time=2056] And there's this little phrase about Esther on why she was so attractive to everybody.
[time=2066] And it's because she didn't make all the requests that all the other women must have been making.
[time=2072] And it was her heart, her submissive heart that was attractive to others and to King Xerxes.
[time=2080] And God used that heart in a mighty way.
[time=2083] In your marriage, you may not think you're rebelling like queen Vashti.
[time=2088] But in that fight for control sometimes, I want you to realize that God does so much more.
[time=2095] With a submissive heart that models Christ, then you taking control back from God.
[time=2105] It's not a list of actions that you take.
[time=2109] It's not a list of responses that you give.
[time=2113] It's an attitude of your heart.
[time=2116] And this first point, we're desperately hoping that everybody can sense that it's about your heart relationship with him
[time=2123] that should drive your heart relationship with him, your husband.
[time=2129] And so we ask a couple of questions we thought might be good for you to think about.
[time=2133] The first one is, how would you describe your heart condition toward your husband's wives?
[time=2141] How would you describe your own heart condition toward your husband?
[time=2148] Rebellious, controlling or submissive.
[time=2153] And then we want to follow up with this question and write this down.
[time=2156] So describe your heart condition toward your husband.
[time=2159] Follow it with this.
[time=2160] Does it reflect your heart condition toward Christ?
[time=2176] Because in the same way, wives be submissive to your husband's.
[time=2181] It's heartfelt.
[time=2182] It's not manufactured.
[time=2183] And it flows from a submissive heart, from a humble heart toward Christ into every horizontal relationship, including the one with your husband.
[time=2194] So it's heartfelt, not manufactured, and it's also influential, not manipulative.
[time=2202] I listened to a really good sermon.
[time=2204] It wasn't a sermon.
[time=2205] It was Bethmore speaking to a group of women at Passion.
[time=2208] Kelly gave me the CD this week to listen to.
[time=2210] It was great.
[time=2211] I loved it.
[time=2212] When she was talking to a group of women about this, she said, "You all know how seductive we can be."
[time=2221] And she kind of stopped and waited.
[time=2223] Women, you know, seductive comes in lots of forms.
[time=2228] I know this much.
[time=2229] If Nancy turns the tears on, I'm history.
[time=2234] I'm going to outcave in a heartbeat.
[time=2238] If they're genuinely coming from a response that's really tearful, that's wonderful.
[time=2243] If she can do that at the drop of a hat and use that in some women, I think, can, you'd never do that, would you?
[time=2249] There we are.
[time=2252] It's heartfelt.
[time=2254] It's not manufactured.
[time=2256] And it's influential without words, without methodology, without being seductive, without manipulating us.
[time=2265] And I just, I hate the reality that I'm so easily manipulated by women.
[time=2270] But I am.
[time=2272] That's a good thing that he did, I'm sure.
[time=2275] It's a good thing. I get to respond to women, but man, you can control me.
[time=2283] Be careful with that.
[time=2285] Verse 1, the second part says, "So that if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words."
[time=2295] You know you can win us over without words.
[time=2298] You do it in those manipulating ways all the time that you want to.
[time=2304] You're saying, take advantage of that and do it to honor me.
[time=2309] A submissive heart is influential because it's attractive.
[time=2313] The behavior is attractive.
[time=2315] In that day, 2,000 years ago, women were fully surrendering to Christ at a faster rate than men because they had a whole lot less to lose culturally.
[time=2325] And so this was happening.
[time=2327] You'd get a believing wife married to an unbelieving, non-fully-surrendered husband.
[time=2333] And the culture of the day said wife, submit to your husbands.
[time=2336] But this is different.
[time=2337] This says, out of your heart, out of your reverence to Christ and with this power, submit a life horizontally to everybody, including your husband.
[time=2350] And it says without words.
[time=2352] Steve said first hour that if it's without words, it says without words.
[time=2356] I don't know what I said.
[time=2357] You said if it says without words, then there must have been a problem on women using too many words.
[time=2364] I didn't say that.
[time=2366] I read this statistic a long time ago.
[time=2368] Men say 12,500 words a day.
[time=2379] All right? Women are verbal. Women are verbal.
[time=2385] But it's amazing the power that they have without words.
[time=2391] And there's all kinds of examples in the Bible.
[time=2395] One contrast is David had two wives, not advocating that.
[time=2401] And I don't think the Bible advocates that.
[time=2404] Abigail and Michael.
[time=2406] Michael was Saul's daughter.
[time=2408] Abigail was, remember, the widow of Nabal, who was a fool?
[time=2413] And you see Abigail just being the servant heart, the submissive heart to David.
[time=2420] But when David danced before the Lord, when the Ark returned, Michael said, "You are a disgrace."
[time=2428] And that was the end of basically their relationship, all because she sought control.
[time=2435] Rather than yielding the submissive heart that Abigail had, and she had, apparently, a better relationship with David because of it.
[time=2444] Joseph and Daniel are pictures of men who wear their behavior and their submissive heart were so influential, so influential.
[time=2452] Joseph influenced Pharaoh.
[time=2454] Daniel influenced Darius.
[time=2456] He influenced King Nebuchadnezzar all with his life, all with his behavior.
[time=2463] He was so influential.
[time=2466] And so I want to ask you this question right now.
[time=2469] You might want to write it down.
[time=2471] What words get in the way, wives?
[time=2475] What words get in the way of God's work and your husband?
[time=2487] You know, the answer to that, we thought of a couple general areas of discussion when it comes to those words.
[time=2495] And the answer to that might be that you have a tendency to label your husband.
[time=2501] You say things like you never or you always.
[time=2507] That's a real natural.
[time=2509] You don't have to think that up.
[time=2511] That's a very natural thing for us to do.
[time=2513] So you might have a tendency to label your husband and say you never do this, right?
[time=2518] Or you always do that the way you want to.
[time=2521] And possibly there's another possibility.
[time=2524] Maybe you have a tendency to compare your husband to other people.
[time=2530] I'll guarantee you this.
[time=2532] You do not know Mitchell, Kelly, or me from what you observe up here.
[time=2540] Any women that compare to another man that they see periodically to somebody that you see on television.
[time=2546] Somebody, somebody even a neighbor or a friend that you think you know.
[time=2550] You don't know them.
[time=2552] It's dangerous to compare your husband to someone you only know in public.
[time=2559] Really dangerous.
[time=2561] And it hurts.
[time=2562] It hurts us when we get compared to other people when you're telling us about this part of them.
[time=2568] This little part of them.
[time=2570] And you know all the weaknesses and flaws in us.
[time=2573] We care about that.
[time=2575] Labeling.
[time=2576] Don't compare.
[time=2577] Write that down.
[time=2578] Don't label.
[time=2579] Don't compare.
[time=2580] Don't label.
[time=2581] Don't compare.
[time=2583] Those things.
[time=2584] What we've been talking about in this section about being influential, not manipulative.
[time=2589] It sounds negative.
[time=2591] But that's because in our natural condition we do the wrong thing.
[time=2595] You know, it sounds negative like we're out to manipulate people because reality is.
[time=2601] We have to struggle with that all the time in the flesh.
[time=2603] We do want to manipulate our husbands instead of being influential.
[time=2610] Allowing God to work through us.
[time=2612] It's natural as can be.
[time=2614] John 3.30.
[time=2615] Yeah, let's look at John 3.30.
[time=2620] He says he must become greater.
[time=2624] This is John the Baptist.
[time=2625] Remember in John 3.30?
[time=2627] John the Baptist, you know, he had a whole lot of people that were his disciples.
[time=2631] He was famous.
[time=2632] And he could have grown that number bigger and bigger, reality was.
[time=2636] Because he was really unique.
[time=2638] People that are really strange like John the Baptist get big followings.
[time=2642] But instead he recognized who Christ was.
[time=2645] And it's a great verse for all of us.
[time=2648] He must become greater.
[time=2650] I must become less.
[time=2652] That's true in our marriages.
[time=2654] That's for a husband as well.
[time=2656] He must become greater in our marriage.
[time=2658] I must become less.
[time=2660] I'll lay myself down for her because I'm doing it for him.
[time=2663] Wives, same way.
[time=2665] He must become greater in your marriage.
[time=2668] You must become less.
[time=2670] You know, we talk about without words.
[time=2674] You see that submission is heartfelt, not manufactured.
[time=2678] Wives in the same way with Christ is an example.
[time=2680] Be submissive.
[time=2681] It's a heart condition to your husbands.
[time=2682] And it flows out of your submission to Christ.
[time=2684] Why?
[time=2686] Because it's influential, not manipulative.
[time=2688] So that any of them do not believe the word.
[time=2690] If never fully surrendered, they may be won over.
[time=2693] Without words.
[time=2696] How many women here, I want you to raise your hand.
[time=2700] Ever said anything that your husband did not hear.
[time=2704] Raise your hand.
[time=2706] Raise them high.
[time=2708] How many could that be a regular occurrence?
[time=2712] See, it's going to be your behavior.
[time=2715] Your heart, your life, not your words.
[time=2719] Not your words.
[time=2720] Submission is heartfelt, not manufactured.
[time=2722] Submission is influential, not manipulative.
[time=2725] Submission is sincere, not make believe.
[time=2730] It's sincere, not make believe.
[time=2732] You might say, well, what's the difference between heartfelt and sincere?
[time=2735] Heart felt is from the inside out.
[time=2737] Sincere is the same all the way through.
[time=2743] Look at verse, the last part of verse one and verse two.
[time=2748] By the behavior of their wives, when they see, when husbands see,
[time=2754] the purity and reverence of your lives.
[time=2757] Men are visual, men are visual.
[time=2760] Not by words, will they be won over?
[time=2763] But by the behavior, by your behavior of their wives, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives,
[time=2773] when they see sincerity, that you're the same all the way through.
[time=2780] I want to show you something.
[time=2785] Sincere means literally without wax, literally without wax.
[time=2791] And so pottery makers, is that what they would be called?
[time=2796] Pottery makers 2000 years ago would hide flaws in the pottery with wax.
[time=2804] Marble cutters.
[time=2807] Cutters would hide flaws in the marble with wax.
[time=2815] Sincere meant without wax, it was the same all the way through.
[time=2821] And the only way you would know if there was wax would be to hold it to the light.
[time=2829] Now, this is big.
[time=2831] If you're sincere all the way through, your submission to Christ is without wax, and it will flow into submission to your husband, and you will be the same all the way through by the light of Christ.
[time=2849] And he will see the purity and the reverence of your life.
[time=2854] He will see Christ.
[time=2858] He will see Christ because you're sincere.
[time=2862] You're pure and reverent all the way through.
[time=2867] That word translated purity there in that text is a word that means you're set aside.
[time=2875] You're signified for the betterment of someone else.
[time=2881] I took a little informal survey a few years ago,
[time=2888] and I talked to different groups of women in my life.
[time=2892] And I was asking them a question.
[time=2894] I wanted to know about this purity, this modesty.
[time=2897] And I asked a group of high school girls.
[time=2901] I said, you know, tell me, what's the word modest mean to you?
[time=2906] And they said, not tight, not low, not short.
[time=2912] Those were the kinds of phrases that they used.
[time=2914] And I went to the high school faculty and I asked those women what modesty meant to them,
[time=2920] and they said, not tight, not low, not short.
[time=2926] And then I asked Aida Tafla, I was alone with her, and I was kind of fascinated by the fact that all those people had said those same things.
[time=2934] I asked her about purity, and I actually said, how would you define modesty, what would you say as modest?
[time=2940] And Aida, like, what that? She said, oh, that's pure, demure.
[time=2946] I said, I was like, why did you say that instead of, and I told her what I'd heard from all the other women that I talked to.
[time=2954] She said this, it was so interesting.
[time=2956] She said, I probably said pure because he's the only husband I've ever had.
[time=2964] He's the groom, I'm his bride.
[time=2967] He's the only one I've had, and it's been a priority for me
[time=2973] to make sure that I'm pure for him.
[time=2978] Pure, set aside for, signified for the benefit of another person.
[time=2988] When men see the purity in your life, it speaks so loudly, they don't need any words.
[time=3002] Submission is sincere, not make believe.
[time=3005] And sincere is the same all the way through, and sincerity is not just pure, it's reverent.
[time=3010] Look, it says, when he sees the purity and reverence of your lives, reverence is fear.
[time=3016] It's the proper kind of fear of the Lord.
[time=3018] It's a humility toward God.
[time=3020] It's a reverence toward God, and that gets lived out horizontally.
[time=3025] Remember, hupotasso, submissive means literally to place under.
[time=3030] I place myself under God, and I place myself under in a heart condition toward other people.
[time=3037] And that's heartfelt, not manufactured, that's influential, not manipulative, that is sincere, not make believe.
[time=3046] It's like being a helper, helper.
[time=3050] That's the word that's used for the first woman ever created, helper.
[time=3058] That word is used for only one other person throughout Scripture.
[time=3062] You know who it is?
[time=3064] It's God.
[time=3067] Wise, as you revere God, you will revere your husband.
[time=3073] It will just be natural.
[time=3076] It will just be natural, as you're a helper, that he'll see God.
[time=3083] And you might say, well, how am I going to do that in my life?
[time=3086] I just want to give you one little thing that Susan and I learned from Sam and Jen Barfel.
[time=3091] We were all together at Kelly's house for a barbecue, all the pastors and wives and the kids.
[time=3096] And we were out knocking around playing basketball and doing some fun things.
[time=3100] I think I was starting to tell a story as sometimes we do.
[time=3104] And simultaneous to this, Susan is with Jen and some other people and thinking it's time to go.
[time=3111] Because we have kids, we had a baby, that time needed to be put in bed.
[time=3115] So she says, I think I'll go tell Mitch it's time to go.
[time=3118] She goes, yeah, I was thinking about doing the same thing with Sam.
[time=3121] We got a signal.
[time=3123] Susan goes, you got a signal, what's that?
[time=3125] See, this is behavior, not words.
[time=3127] She says, well, it's real simple.
[time=3130] We just walk up to the other one and if it's time to go or maybe we got something to say, we'll just kind of do this.
[time=3136] For you over here, we're just going to do this.
[time=3139] So Susan laughs and says, that's funny, I'll go try that.
[time=3144] So I'm in the middle of a story with all the guys.
[time=3148] And Susan walks up to me and does this.
[time=3151] And I go, what do you want?
[time=3153] I stopped in mid-sentence.
[time=3156] Now, let's just say, she would have come over and say, hey Mitch, it's time to go.
[time=3162] I said, what?
[time=3163] I finished my story.
[time=3165] But it was that nonverbal, that nonverbal essence of a woman, that behavior, that touch.
[time=3170] It was just like that.
[time=3172] She had me.
[time=3174] Why don't you, wives, decide today and work it out with your husband with as few words
[time=3180] as possible.
[time=3181] What that nonverbal cue is going to be for you.
[time=3186] I was telling Bob Purdy, and all of a sudden I fell alone, like I'm the only guy without nonverbal cues.
[time=3191] And Bob says, oh yeah, yeah, we do that too.
[time=3193] I go, you do?
[time=3194] He goes, yeah, and we even have one back.
[time=3196] To let you know that we heard you and we'll respond, but just a minute, we might be in the middle of a conversation.
[time=3201] They do this with their kids.
[time=3202] He says, we put our hand on yours.
[time=3204] So I like this.
[time=3205] There's a lot of touching going on.
[time=3206] I think this is great.
[time=3207] And all the men said, amen.
[time=3209] And all right, so really, here's what this is.
[time=3212] This is really just love.
[time=3214] It's just love.
[time=3215] Look at Romans 12, 9 says, Paul writes, love must be sincere, the same all the way through,
[time=3225] because it comes from God, without wax.
[time=3228] When they see the purity and the reverence of your lives, I want you to write this question
[time=3234] down.
[time=3235] How can you be sincere?
[time=3237] How can you be pure and reverent?
[time=3239] Write this down, wives.
[time=3240] How can you be sincere?
[time=3242] How can you be pure and reverent?
[time=3245] What nonverbal cue could you do today, decide to do today with your husband?
[time=3250] Just kind of boost up that relationship and take advantage of revealing Christ to him
[time=3257] in the way that we're sharing here.
[time=3259] You know, I, to conclude this, we see that submission is heartfelt, not manipulative,
[time=3266] it's from the inside out.
[time=3269] And we see that it's highly influential.
[time=3272] I'm sorry, it's heartfelt, not manufactured.
[time=3277] It's highly influential because it's not manipulative.
[time=3283] And it reveals Christ.
[time=3284] It allows God to be God.
[time=3286] I decrease He increases.
[time=3289] And then it's sincere, not make believe, no wax.
[time=3293] It's the same all the way through purity and reverence.
[time=3298] Those take place.
[time=3300] And here's what happens when that occurs.
[time=3306] When a husband sees the life of his wife, he sees his.
[time=3326] He sees Christ's.
[time=3329] But also, when the husband sees the life of his wife, that submissive spirit,
[time=3339] he sees his.
[time=3342] And just like I was sitting in that car with Susan with all that stuff coming up and finally, you know, realize it was her behavior that convicted me.
[time=3353] I'm ashamed to say that 14 or 15 years ago I was headed the other direction in my marriage.
[time=3358] And I got to tell you that it's not one word that Susan said that won me over.
[time=3365] It was her behavior.
[time=3367] It was her life.
[time=3368] It was her heart.
[time=3370] And she has never manufactured that heartfelt submission.
[time=3375] I have never once felt manipulated by my wife.
[time=3379] I have never once felt that her love is make believe.
[time=3383] And I watched in common ground here in the last couple years three couples have come to Christ and it was the same thing.
[time=3389] It was the same thing.
[time=3390] The wives came to Christ first and then the guys did.
[time=3395] And it was because of the attractive behavior and spirit of their wives.
[time=3400] I asked one of them this morning, Matt and Jackie.
[time=3403] I said, Matt, what drew you to Christ?
[time=3407] What about your wife drew you to Christ?
[time=3410] Well, there was that time period where she was in and you were out.
[time=3414] And he said, oh, it was her heart.
[time=3419] It was her life.
[time=3422] It was the way she acted.
[time=3423] I couldn't make her mad anymore.
[time=3426] He said it was amazing.
[time=3429] And wherever you are today, wife, with your husband, just look at this little acronym we came up with.
[time=3437] When he sees your life of submission, he'll see his, Christ's, and he'll be convicted and he'll see his, his own.
[time=3450] As men, I think we probably know something about submission.
[time=3455] But I don't think there's anything harder on the planet than a wife who is called by God to submit to an unbelieving husband without words.
[time=3467] I can't imagine doing that day in and day out and we realize that.
[time=3472] Even a believing husband that's not easy to live with for a woman to be what God has designed.
[time=3478] I've had two women like that.
[time=3481] I've seen it. Renee's was like that and Nancy's like that.
[time=3484] I've seen how influential they can be when they just submit to him.
[time=3490] Out of reverence for him, submit to me.
[time=3494] And I want to pray for you because I know it's hard to do with me.
[time=3499] I know that.
[time=3501] So it's probably hard for you too.
[time=3504] Let's pray.
[time=3509] Our Father in heaven, you are God.
[time=3514] And I pray for our women, our sisters in Christ here in this body of believers.
[time=3519] I pray for them, Lord, that you would fill them up with your spirit, that they would have a heart filled submission to you so that they can sincerely influence their husbands with your truth in their lives.
[time=3538] In their lives being fleshed out.
[time=3541] God, please empower our women.
[time=3543] I know it must be so hard.
[time=3546] And I pray that you would fill them up and they would be beacons of light in their homes as they submit in reverence to you with pure and reverent hearts, not with words.
[time=3559] Please help them do that.
[time=3560] In Jesus' name I pray.
[time=3562] [AMEN]
