[time=396] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I am so thankful that you've tuned in again.
[time=403] If you've been watching the broadcast, you know that we are in the midst of an ongoing study of the book of 1 Peter.
[time=410] And we have come today, actually in recent weeks, to a section in 1 Peter, chapter three, verses one to seven.
[time=418] And in chapter three, verses one to seven, we see God giving us His design for what is, I think by far, the most important of human relationships.
[time=429] The most important of human relationships in God's design, the most important human relationship we have in the scope of life, and I think you would agree with me, that that is the relationship between a man and a woman, the relationship between a husband and a wife.
[time=446] And as we see God's design in these verses, I'm reminded how very impactful, how very pertinent, how very relevant, how central this relationship is to so many things.
[time=460] I mean, it impacts homes, it impacts sons and daughters, it impacts generations to come, and God has given us His design, and we have got to do our best with His help, to understand it and then begin to live it out.
[time=475] We began a couple weeks ago with Steve and Mitch giving us kind of the beginnings of verses one through six and they begin to talk about the role that a woman plays, the role of a wife in this relationship.
[time=489] They talked about God's design as it relates to submission.
[time=493] Today, you're gonna hear a message as we continue our way through the passage, talking about again, the role that the wife plays and moving from submission to this thing called biblical beauty.
[time=506] Ladies, there is a way that you can in your submissive spirit and in the way that you present yourself to Him, the husband.
[time=515] There is a way that God can use you in a powerful way to soften His heart, to lead Him back or lead Him for the first time to that which God has for Him.
[time=527] In the weeks to come, we're gonna be talking about the husband.
[time=530] We're gonna be talking about the role the husband plays.
[time=533] God's designed for a man in a marriage relationship.
[time=537] And I guess I just wanna say this to you.
[time=539] You know and I know how hard it is these days for marriages.
[time=543] You know and I know that many of them are not going well.
[time=548] And we wanna make these resources available to you.
[time=551] We wanna make these teachings available to you.
[time=553] We want to encourage you as best we can.
[time=555] And so I wanna just invite you to do this.
[time=558] If you're part of the Blackhawk family, we wanna make sure you visit the Blackhawk to go table out in the four year.
[time=564] There at the Blackhawk to go table, you can access resources, CDs, DVDs, VHSs, cassettes.
[time=571] We wanna do everything we can to put these teachings in your hands so that you can be reminded, so that you can be encouraged, so that you can share God's design with others who may be in need.
[time=583] If you're not here on a Sunday and you wanna access our website, you can go to the BlackhawkMinistries.org website and click up on the top under here, see or buy messages.
[time=595] You can click on there and all of these resources can be made available to you.
[time=599] You can purchase a CD, a VHS or a DVD.
[time=603] Our hope is that as you listen to these teachings, our hope is that as you become more familiar with God's design, your heart, your marriage can be strengthened.
[time=614] We're so thankful that we get to have this ministry with you and our hope is that as a wife or as a husband, you would open your heart to the truth of God's word, that you would open your life to what he would have for you in this most important of all relationships.
[time=631] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=633] Thanks for the encouragement that so many of you give us as we continue to do our best to help seeking people, seeking couples, find and know what it means to follow Christ.

[time=743] - Well, let me welcome you back to our study in the book of First Peter.
[time=747] If you have your Bibles, open up to First Peter chapter three.
[time=750] And we continue this morning in a passage about marriage, about the role of a husband and the role of a wife in this most important of all relationships.
[time=763] And we come today to a section here in chapter three that talks about being attractive as a woman, being attractive, God's design, what God's word has to say about you being attractive and how God can use that attractiveness in His design for marriage.
[time=785] A biblical look at being attractive or as I've said this morning, who's hot and who's not.
[time=791] First Peter chapter three, verses one through six.
[time=796] And as I mentioned, this is about marriage.
[time=799] And this is about the relationship between a husband and a wife.
[time=803] And you don't need me, I don't think, to stand here and say to you what I think most of us in the room know.
[time=811] And you know what, we know this.
[time=813] And sometimes I think in knowing this and even talking about it, we almost paint it out to be something that's new or unique to this timeframe or this period.
[time=821] We'll talk about this as if somehow it's new news.
[time=825] But you know what, my friends, it's not new news.
[time=827] It's always been, by and large this way, marriage is in trouble.
[time=833] The marriage institution, the relationships between husbands and wives in many, many cases, it is not going well.
[time=844] You see it and I see it.
[time=847] Sometimes I wish I didn't see as much as I see.
[time=852] But they are marriages imploding everywhere.
[time=857] They are absolutely disintegrating.
[time=859] And sometimes we see it, you know, sometimes a marriage just gets to a point where the reality of it and the way it plays out, it just becomes visible, right?
[time=868] I mean, we just, we see it.
[time=870] You can't hide it any longer.
[time=872] Choices get made, things get done.
[time=875] Couples begin to move down certain paths and all of a sudden it's just there for everyone to see an imploding, struggling, disintegrating marriage.
[time=887] But see, those are just the ones that get to that point where they become evident.
[time=892] There are so many others, many of us sitting in this room, many others out in this community.
[time=899] And though outwardly you may not see some of what we see in these others, you and I know that right under the surface there rests this uneasiness, this unsettledness, this disappointment, in some cases, a hopelessness.
[time=915] There is this widespread disappointment, this widespread struggle.
[time=921] I listen to people describe their marriages and they use terms like empty and lonely and painful.
[time=929] And the bottom line on all of it, and you know what, it's always been the bottom line.
[time=936] It is the bottom line today and it will always be the bottom line in the future.
[time=941] The bottom line is the reason we find ourselves in these situations.
[time=946] The reasons marriage is struggling to the degree that it is today is because God gave us a design for marriage.
[time=954] The design has never been altered.
[time=958] God gave us a design for marriage.
[time=961] How men are to come at this.
[time=963] How men as husbands are to give themselves to it.
[time=966] How women are as wives to bring themselves to this equation.
[time=972] God gave us a design.
[time=974] It's been around from the beginning and to this day we continue to try and alter the design.
[time=981] We continue, what I mean by that, is we continue to choose to live in ways that would move us away as men and women from this perfect recipe that he gave you and I.
[time=996] God's design.
[time=1000] Next week we will come to verse seven in first Peter chapter three and we will look closely at the design God gave for men for husbands.
[time=1010] This morning we continue through verses one through six, Mitch and Steve began our journeys through this part of the passage last week and we see in verses one through six here, God's design for women, for all women, for you wives in the audience, yes, for those of you maybe here today who aren't wives but someday you might be please.
[time=1032] Listen, open your hearts.
[time=1034] This is applicable to every woman.
[time=1036] God wants you to be aware of what his design for you is and this most important of all relationships.
[time=1043] Let me just say it to you in some very simple words and then we're gonna read through the passage.
[time=1050] Ladies, God's design, wives, God's design for you is that you would evidence and practice a strong and growing trust in God, in God, a strong and growing trust in him.
[time=1063] It implies that you have a relationship with him, one that is active, one that is growing, one that is marked by humility and teachability.
[time=1072] You engaged in a relationship with him.
[time=1076] A strong, growing trust in God is the foundation of his design for you as a wife.
[time=1083] A trust in God that leads to a sweet submission, a beautiful heart and a courageous hope.
[time=1091] And you will see that right here in our passage this morning.
[time=1094] Would you stand in honor of God's word and allow me to read for you first Peter three verses one to six.
[time=1100] Says in the same way, you wives be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient, I'll stop you right there and I'll just again relate to you that this disobedient husband, this could be a husband who doesn't know the Lord.
[time=1115] This could be a husband who has not fully surrendered his heart and life to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1122] This could also be a husband who's in disobedience.
[time=1125] He may know the Lord, but he may be at this time making choices that move him in a different direction.
[time=1131] Unsaved or disobedient, the text still applies.
[time=1135] Be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word they, the husband may be won back one over without a word by the behavior of their wives as they observe your chaste and your respectful behavior.
[time=1153] Your adornment, that which is attractive about you must not merely be external, braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or putting on dresses, but let it be that which is attractive about you.
[time=1168] Let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit which is precious in the sight of God.
[time=1177] For in this way, in former times the holy women also who hoped in God used to adorn themselves being submissive to their own husbands just as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.
[time=1199] Would you pray with me, Father God, we stand humbly before you.
[time=1204] Realizing that here in this text, God here in these verses, as it relates to wives and women even as it relates to husbands and men, this would be this truth today, would be so counterculture.
[time=1221] God so much of what we see, so much of what we hear, so much of what we live in today, so much of what is communicated God would attempt to move us in the absolute opposite direction.
[time=1232] And God there is a part of that message that connects to our humanness and our pride and our self-sufficiency.
[time=1242] And so God I pray that women and men all over this room this morning, God would humble themselves, that we would be humble before you with hearts and minds and lives wide open to whatever it is God you may have for us today.
[time=1259] We ask it in your son's name, amen.
[time=1263] You can be seated.
[time=1264] Well ladies, that is God's design for you,
[time=1270] right there, one through six, a strong trust in God, a trust that leads to a sweet, submissive heart, a beautiful heart and a courageous hope.
[time=1278] Here's the problem, ladies.
[time=1281] Here's the problem.
[time=1282] The problem is that design, that perfect design took a major, major hit.
[time=1288] Back in a place called the Garden of Eden.
[time=1292] See back in Genesis chapter three, we see that God's perfect design and the way things began to be played out there, choices that were made, this design just got absolutely dinged.
[time=1305] And it's been dinged ever since.
[time=1308] Watch what happened, many of you know the story.
[time=1310] It says in Genesis chapter three, verse one, referring to the serpent, we know that evil, the enemy had taken the form of the serpent and the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said to the woman, indeed, woman, he talks to Eve there, he says, indeed, has God said you shall not eat from any tree of the garden?
[time=1330] He casts doubt already.
[time=1332] The woman said to the serpent, well from the fruit of the trees of the garden, we may eat, but from the fruit of the tree, which is in the middle of the garden, God has said you shall not eat from it or touch it or you will die.
[time=1347] Here you go, the serpent said to the woman, you surely will not die.
[time=1354] He lied to her.
[time=1360] He lied, he lied big time to her and she listens.
[time=1369] For God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened.
[time=1373] Here comes the lie, now he starts to unfold it.
[time=1376] Your eyes will be opened, he says, you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
[time=1382] He in essence says to the woman, you will know what, everything.
[time=1387] You'll be in charge, you'll be in control, you'll know it all, eat it, it'll be good.
[time=1396] And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate.
[time=1407] And she gave also to her husband with her and he ate and then boom, there it is, you know the feeling so do I.
[time=1417] The choice is made and then boom, the eyes of both of them were opened.
[time=1422] And they knew what they had not known before, they knew that they were naked.
[time=1427] And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
[time=1430] My friends, you see there in the text that he lied to her,
[time=1436] he told her she could be in charge like God and she bought it and she believed the lie.
[time=1444] And according to Nancy Lee DeMoss, you may recognize that name, a well-known radio personality and Christian author, according to Nancy Lee DeMoss, the enemy has continued to lie to women and women have continued to be deceived.
[time=1464] And ladies, please understand and please hear the spirit with which I say that to you this morning.
[time=1470] I do not say to you, he has continued to lie and you have continued to be deceived as if I'm upset with you and wish you would get your act together and it's the farthest thing from my heart.
[time=1484] I love you, we love you.
[time=1487] I am, we are for you and I want for you God's design.
[time=1492] And my heart breaks in any situation
[time=1498] where God's design is violated because God's design is right and God's design brings life and God's design brings freedom and God's design brings fulfillment.
[time=1509] I'm not mad at you, my heart breaks for you.
[time=1513] And I want for you and I want for your husband like I want for my own marriage, God's best.
[time=1519] And so I say this with encouragement.
[time=1521] DeMoss says, Nancy DeMoss says in her best-selling book, lies that women believe and the truth that sets them free.
[time=1530] She says that a large percentage of Christian women could be described with one or more of the following words, frazzled, exhausted, burned out, overwhelmed, confused, angry, defeated, frustrated, discouraged, depressed, ashamed, emotionally unstable, uptight, insecure, lonely, fearful and yes, even suicidal.
[time=1551] And these are Christian women.
[time=1556] She has come to a simple but profound conclusion about the root of most of women's struggles today.
[time=1562] And women, she says, have been lied to.
[time=1566] And women have been deceived.
[time=1570] She unravels in this book about 40 lies that we have embraced that you have embraced as women.
[time=1576] And several of them, as you look through there, several of them have to do with marriage and the marriage relationship.
[time=1582] Here's just a few.
[time=1583] I have a right, here's lie number one.
[time=1584] I have a right as a woman, as a wife.
[time=1586] I have a right to be happy.
[time=1591] I have to have a husband to be happy.
[time=1595] It's my responsibility, another lie.
[time=1598] It's my, from the enemy.
[time=1600] It's my responsibility to change my husband, to address his weaknesses and show marked improvement.
[time=1607] My husband is supposed to serve me.
[time=1610] If my husband is passive, I've got to take another lie here.
[time=1615] If my husband is passive, I've got to take the initiative or nothing will ever get done.
[time=1622] The last one here that I know that ties into our passage today when we hear this often.
[time=1628] If I submit to my husband, if I give myself to God's design,
[time=1634] if I willingly come under him and all of his weaknesses and all of his faults, I will be miserable.
[time=1648] We hear that, you hear it, sometimes maybe you've even said it.
[time=1653] Some will say that submission and God's design are oppressive towards women.
[time=1662] God's design is even abusive, some might even say,
[time=1668] that coming under a man only leads to pain and a robbing of a woman's joy and her dignity.
[time=1673] And it's always so interesting to hear that and then consider the godly wife in Proverbs 31 who chose God's design, who gave herself
[time=1687] to that kind of living.
[time=1688] And when you go to Proverbs 31 and you read through that passage, if you were to do that tonight, what you would see, if you read through Proverbs 31, as you would see a woman well-dressed, she and her family having absolutely plenty to eat,
[time=1705] so much so that there's an abundance and they share it with others, you would read about a woman with a well-ordered life, emotional stability and freedom from fear about the future.
[time=1716] She has, as you read through that section, a husband who is absolutely crazy about her, faithful to her and bragging to his friends about his one and a million wife and you would see children who honor her and praise her.
[time=1734] Now how does that happen?
[time=1736] Well, the passage is clear.
[time=1738] Proverbs 31 would teach you and I that she is a woman who fears, who respects, who trusts God.
[time=1745] She fears God more than fearing, not having her own way.
[time=1749] More than fearing loss, more than fearing loneliness, more than fearing suffering.
[time=1755] She has a humble awareness of who she is in light of a holy god and she gladly accepts, embraces and submits to, and serves in that holy calling as a wife and a mother.
[time=1769] So how will you respond, ladies?
[time=1775] He is going to, He is going to keep lying to you.
[time=1781] You hear it every day, it is everywhere you go and it is in your fallenness, just like me, it is within you, the perpetuation of these lies.
[time=1791] How will you respond?
[time=1794] Well, last week, Stephen Mitch brought us to this passage and in the first two verses, we saw a lie.
[time=1800] We did.
[time=1801] If you go back to 1 Peter 3, 1 to 2, we see a classic lie that the enemy wants to perpetuate with wives.
[time=1810] You see it there in the same way, you wives be submissive to your own husband so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, you may, they may be one without a word.
[time=1821] By the behavior of their wives, there's a lie for you right there.
[time=1824] The lie is, and the enemy whispers it to you, sometimes he screams it to you and the lie is this.
[time=1830] You as a wife can take a disobedient husband and you can talk him, confront him, nag him, criticize him or debate him back into who he should be, doing what he should do.
[time=1848] And God's word says categorically wrong.
[time=1852] It doesn't happen.
[time=1856] It never does, it doesn't work.
[time=1859] Many of you in the room this morning could raise your hands.
[time=1861] If I asked you to raise your hand, if you're a woman here who has over time realized that you can't talk him into the man, God wants him to be.
[time=1870] No, God's design is that your chaste
[time=1876] and respectful behavior is what can bring change to a man.
[time=1880] And Steve and Mitch spoke to that, did a great job helping us see how very important it is that behavior be such that a man can see the work of God
[time=1893] in the life of a woman.
[time=1896] Our text this morning moves from behavior to beauty.
[time=1900] That's right, our text this morning says that there is a beauty, listen, says that there is a beauty that you can possess as a wife, that is a powerful tool used by God in the life of a man.
[time=1914] There is a thing called biblical beauty.
[time=1916] And Peter wants you and I to realize not only what true beauty looks like, but how God uses it in the marriage relationship.
[time=1926] Here we go.
[time=1928] First Peter chapter three, verses three through six.
[time=1932] Number one, write this down as it relates to biblical beauty.
[time=1936] It is a little, watch this, it's a little about the hair.
[time=1941] All right, it's a little about the hair, this biblical beauty.
[time=1945] Look at verse three, your adornment, stop, your adornment.
[time=1949] Adornment there is that which is going to be attractive about you as a woman, that which is going to be pretty, that which is going to be beautiful.
[time=1957] Your adornment must not merely be, must not be merely external, braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or putting on dresses.
[time=1968] Now I want you to stop right there and look at that.
[time=1970] The use of the word merely.
[time=1973] What's implied is that a portion of what is beautiful, right?
[time=1977] A portion, not the whole, and you know what?
[time=1982] The text will show you today, not even really most of, but a portion of what is beautiful is the external physical component.
[time=1992] Peter reminds wives that as it relates to, watch this, as it relates to being beautiful for your husband, nobody else, nobody else, as it relates to being beautiful for your husband,
[time=2008] it's okay to get dressed up periodically.
[time=2012] The text here in verse three says, in essence there is some value to you taking time and making some effort to accentuate the positives, to present yourself to him in a way that is attractive, to have fun in that arena.
[time=2026] He says that's a good thing periodically with that going overboard, do that.
[time=2033] Now watch, here comes a lie.
[time=2035] What does the enemy say to you ladies?
[time=2038] In that arena today, see what the enemy says to you in that arena today is that no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's not a portion, this physical thing, it's not a portion of what is beautiful, it's the whole ball game.
[time=2051] The lie for you today is go overboard on this.
[time=2057] The lie today for you as a woman is that beauty is all about the hair, it's all about the shape, it's all about provocative, it's all about the dresses, it's all about the make, it's all about that, period.
[time=2072] He says, that's it and God's word says to you today, no.
[time=2075] It's a little about the hair, it's a lot,
[time=2082] it's a lot about the heart.
[time=2085] Look at that, number two, number one, it's a little bit about the hair, verse three, number two, it is a lot about the heart.
[time=2096] And before I read verse four, I wanna do this, I wanna ask a good friend of mine to come up here and join me on stage, I'm so thankful for her willingness to do this.
[time=2106] Karen Beck, Karen and Tim Beck have been a part of our family here at Black Hawk for a long, long time.
[time=2113] And Tim currently serves in helping coordinate all of our crown, small groups.
[time=2120] Karen has been serving in women's ministry for a number of years and I wanted today, I wanted to be able to have Karen come and we're good friends, we talk about these things often, I'm so thankful for the investment her and Tim have made in our lives, in our family's life.
[time=2138] And as I listen to Karen and as I watch God use her in the lives of women, as I see her teaching and as I see her discipling and as I see those, she has discipled, discipling others.
[time=2150] I know that she has wrestled with these issues in the everyday of life.
[time=2155] I wanna say this to you, so have I.
[time=2157] Me not being in her shoes or sandals.
[time=2162] Sandals, me not being in her sandals does not in any way make me or any other man unable to teach what God's word says about these issues.
[time=2173] I've asked Karen to come not because somehow I can't teach about this because I'm not a woman, no I'm doing my best and will continue to do my best to always represent to you what God's word says.
[time=2184] I've asked Karen to come and bring some perspective that I believe she can bring because of the world she lives and the lessons that she has been learning and those that she has been working with.
[time=2195] And especially as it gets down here to the middle and end of this passage.
[time=2199] It says there we got to verse four, right?
[time=2201] It talks about how it's a lot, it's a little bit about the hair, it's a lot about the heart.
[time=2207] And it says there in verse four, it says, but let it be that which is going to be attractive about you, let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit which is precious in the sight of God.
[time=2228] And I wanna just mention a couple of things there and then I'm gonna ask Karen to just share some insights and observations on this verse in particular.
[time=2237] Look at that word hidden, but let it be the hidden person of the heart.
[time=2242] I think that's an interesting and powerful word.
[time=2244] And as it relates to beauty, ladies and guys, guys, listen, young men, listen, I sometimes get a kick
[time=2255] out of listening to young guys talk about gals.
[time=2259] They'll see a pretty gal and they'll go, wow, she's beautiful.
[time=2264] And they've made that assessment in a span of, oh, nine seconds, right?
[time=2271] We've all been there.
[time=2272] You know, this is a great reminder.
[time=2275] In nine seconds, you, listen, you know nothing about her beauty, nothing about her beauty
[time=2285] if you're going to define beauty, God's way.
[time=2290] Because it's a little bit about the hair.
[time=2293] It is a lot about the heart.
[time=2295] And you know what, my friends?
[time=2296] It takes some time to get to know the what.
[time=2299] And that's how it should be.
[time=2302] God made it that way, He designed it that way.
[time=2304] And I love the word imperishable.
[time=2306] The use of the word imperishable, look at that.
[time=2308] But let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=2315] Verse four is set in direct contrast to verse two, where we talked about the hair and the dresses and the jewelry, which are okay to an extent.
[time=2325] They are fading.
[time=2327] Does the physical last lady's answer?
[time=2331] There you go.
[time=2333] What lasts, my friends?
[time=2336] The what?
[time=2337] It's imperishable.
[time=2339] It's ongoing.
[time=2340] It's unfading.
[time=2341] It's the deal.
[time=2343] The hidden woman of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=2348] Now let me say this and I'll kind of ask Karen a question as I say this to you.
[time=2352] I have always felt as if when I'm thinking about this.
[time=2355] Sometimes in my, just in my own kind of flesh and my heart and thinking about it from a human perspective, I hear this phrase, the gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=2364] And I think gosh, that's not really fair 'cause I know some gals and it's just not their personality.
[time=2370] They're just not gentle.
[time=2372] And then I'm not talking about them being sinful.
[time=2374] I'm just saying, you know what?
[time=2375] It's not how they're wired.
[time=2376] They're not real gentle.
[time=2377] They tend to be louder.
[time=2379] How does this work?
[time=2380] It almost seems unfair.
[time=2381] And I'll even hear gals sometimes say, well, that's a good point, but it's just not me 'cause I'm not gentle and quiet.
[time=2386] Karen, just share it with the folks.
[time=2388] Some of the things you've learned and some of the ways in which you've kind of had to over the years respond to this issue of maybe it not being my personality.
[time=2398] - Well, I was thinking as I listened to you and looked at these verses that I think I've been told that I was born loud and living on the edge.
[time=2407] And if this was a personality trait that had to be, there would be no hope for me, gentle and quiet.
[time=2415] So to me, there's lots of hope in this verse because it's something that God grows in us as women.
[time=2424] It's not a personality.
[time=2425] It's not something that we're born with.
[time=2427] And that gentleness is something that's used to describe Jesus Christ.
[time=2432] He was gentle, mounted on a donkey as he rode into Jerusalem the week before he was crucified.
[time=2439] He invites us to come to him, to be yoked to him because he's gentle and humble in heart.
[time=2447] David said, you gird me with strength.
[time=2451] Your gentleness, oh God, has made me great.
[time=2455] So it's a wonderful God trait.
[time=2458] And that quietness is a spirit that it doesn't mean you're not speaking words, but it's not all right up.
[time=2465] It's not tense.
[time=2466] It's not anxious.
[time=2467] It's not competing.
[time=2469] It's composed.
[time=2471] And Psalm 4610 would be probably a good descriptor to see striving and know that I'm God, to be still.
[time=2478] Why can we be still?
[time=2480] Why can we be quiet?
[time=2482] Because we know that he's God and he's giving us resources to live in our marriage that brings hope and joy and beauty.
[time=2494] So what gets us in trouble?
[time=2497] It's our words.
[time=2499] Proverbs says where there are many words, there are sure to be transgressions.
[time=2503] Our words get us in trouble.
[time=2504] We speak a whole lot more words than men.
[time=2507] And we think our words are gonna win 'em.
[time=2509] But like Kelly said, they're not, they're not.
[time=2512] It's our behavior.
[time=2513] You know, the best way to check your behavior is ask your husband.
[time=2521] Go home from church today, I dare ya.
[time=2523] And ask your husband.
[time=2524] How do I line up with these verses?
[time=2528] Do I have a gentle and a quiet spirit?
[time=2530] How am I responding to you as my husband?
[time=2533] Am I submissive?
[time=2535] Am I respectful?
[time=2537] I really wanna be this woman that God is talking about.
[time=2541] Will you help me lovingly be that kind of woman and show me that?
[time=2548] - Husbands, make sure after church you're quick to listen, slow to speak.
[time=2553] Think that one through, all right?
[time=2557] Answer honestly, but just don't be too anxious there.
[time=2561] - So, Proverbs says it's better to live on the corner of a roofer in the desert than with a contentious woman.
[time=2567] And I don't know any man that wants to live with arguing, competing, nagging, criticizing.
[time=2577] We have an opportunity with our words and our heart to win our husbands.
[time=2583] Do you pay lip service to your husband and then go and do what you wanna do?
[time=2588] Do you respond kindly, gratefully?
[time=2591] Are you grumbling and complaining?
[time=2593] Do you go to him for his counsel?
[time=2596] Do you trust him for what he would speak into your life?
[time=2599] I remember decade, a decade of marriage really without ever understanding submission or respect.
[time=2605] Coming under the authority of God's word and the counsel of older godly women and hearing this concept that it would be honoring to go to my husband and ask him for a counsel.
[time=2614] And so I thought, well, that's a great thing to do and I went to Tim and I said, what do you think about this?
[time=2619] I'm thinking about doing this and he looked at me and he said, I don't know why you're asking me, you're gonna do it, you wanna go do anyways.
[time=2626] And I realized then and there I had a whole lot of work to do.
[time=2630] I had lived very independently of his counsel and his leadership.
[time=2634] So it's exciting with God's help.
[time=2636] We have an opportunity with our lives and with our lips to be a blessing to our husbands.
[time=2641] The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, Proverbs 10, 11 says.
[time=2646] E. B. Hill, great black preacher.
[time=2650] He preached a sermon at his wife's funeral in '87
[time=2656] and he was known for his thunderous sermons
[time=2662] on righteousness and godly living.
[time=2665] He preached the sermon at his wife's funeral and he talked about what a Proverbs 31 woman she had been.
[time=2672] He was born into poverty and they started out their marriage in great poverty.
[time=2677] And he came home one night to a candlelight dinner.
[time=2680] Every room in the house had candles lit and he was thinking, whoa, I'm gonna come it into something really good here tonight and he sits down at dinner and he enjoys this candlelight dinner and he leaves a table later on and goes back to the bathroom and goes to flip on the switch and no electricity.
[time=2700] Huh, light bulb must be out.
[time=2703] Goes into the next room, turns on the switch.
[time=2706] No light, next room, no light.
[time=2711] Comes back and he looks at his wife and he said, what's going on?
[time=2714] The electricity had been turned off that day because they couldn't pay their bills.
[time=2721] Did she demean him, complain, say other husbands are providing for their wives and you're not, I'm sick and tired of living in this?
[time=2731] She loved him with a gift that was indescribable
[time=2737] and her heart and her gentle spirit followed her long after her death.
[time=2745] Do we want that kind of heart?
[time=2750] It's a god thing, he can grow it in us.
[time=2753] - So the gentle and quiet and especially that quiet part if I'm here and you're right, though it might at times show itself audibly, it isn't at its very foundation, a sound talking issue, it's a spirit posture.
[time=2772] It is that Psalm 46, 10 be still and no, be still and trust, it's a trusting spirit.
[time=2780] Well, it's a little ladies, it's a little about the hair.
[time=2784] It is a lot about the heart and the spirit of trust is hope in God.
[time=2791] And we see that played out in a wonderful way with a powerful example in verses five and six.
[time=2797] It's a little bit about the hair, it's a lot about the heart.
[time=2801] Biblical beauty number three, you can write this down, it's hopeful and brave.
[time=2806] It is hopeful, this kind of beauty and it is courageous.
[time=2810] It is brave like Sarah.
[time=2812] Let me read this to you, it says in verse five, for in this way, in former times, the holy women also who hoped in God used to adorn themselves being submissive to their own husbands.
[time=2826] Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.
[time=2837] Now I want to draw your attention, ladies, so a couple of phrases there in those verses that I think are worth pointing out.
[time=2843] Number one, I want you to see who these women of old, these gals who went before you, these gals who, these wives who honored God in such a magnificent way, it says there in the text that they had placed their hope in who?
[time=2860] Say it.
[time=2862] God, see, here's the thing so many times and I understand this.
[time=2866] I understand that in the daily living out of this stuff, it would almost seem as if God is saying or someone like me is saying to you or teaching you that you have to put your hope in your husband.
[time=2879] You need to, you see, that's a lie.
[time=2882] The enemy would want you to kind of think that that's what we're saying here, but that's what this is saying.
[time=2888] That's not what this is saying.
[time=2889] This is making it very clear that a woman in this relationship at the fundamental level is evidencing great hope in God, the God who created the universe, the God who holds the solar systems in his hand, the God who shaped the mountains, the God who tells the sea where to stop, the God who who paints the picture of the sunrise every day, that God is big enough, it's powerful enough to sustain care for and take care of you.
[time=2921] And God's designed for you as a wife is to have your hope, your trust placed firmly in him, capital H, not him, small H.
[time=2934] It's important for you to see that.
[time=2936] As that text unfolds, you also see another lie that the enemy offers.
[time=2942] Look what it says there.
[time=2943] It says being submissive for in this way in former times, the holy women also who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their what?
[time=2952] Say it, to their own husbands.
[time=2955] The enemy says, here's what the enemy says, here's what the enemy whispers sometimes, ladies in your ear, the enemy says, don't submit to or show respect for or follow your husband.
[time=2965] Follow and show respect for the guy you wish your husband was like.
[time=2969] And that gets really, really dangerous.
[time=2976] This is not about other men, this is about your husband and God's design for you to function with him, having placed your hope in God.
[time=2985] You now give yourself to him, little H, and just him and you follow and you respect and you do your very best with God's help to move in and through that relationship with that kind of heart.
[time=2998] Now, the example of Sarah here in the text, Peter just in these last two verses, he gives us this incredible kind of wrap-up to these first six verses.
[time=3008] And Sarah, many of you know Sarah was married to who?
[time=3011] Abraham, and God had promised Abraham a people and a nation, and there came a time when it was time.
[time=3020] God was ready to move Abraham from where he was to this place, and it was time to go.
[time=3027] And so in Hebrews 11a, it even says, some of you know the verse, it says, by faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed God, going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance.
[time=3040] But here's the kicker, for he went out not knowing, okay, come on ladies, you're Sarah, you're the wife, he comes home and says, pack up the tents, get the kids, get all the help together, load up the animals, we're moving.
[time=3058] And he went out not knowing where he was going.
[time=3061] So Sarah might say, as you might say, okay, I'll go get everything put together, this is gonna be really hard, but could you tell me, where are we going?
[time=3068] And Abraham says, I have no clue, we just gotta go.
[time=3073] Well, I can remember moving to Indiana.
[time=3078] I can remember coming home one day and telling Deborah, hey, I hear God calling us to go to Indiana.
[time=3084] And I remember specifically, Deborah going, hold on.
[time=3088] I don't hear him, I don't know what wavelength you're on.
[time=3093] Hold on, let me check, nope, I don't hear him.
[time=3099] And I remember the discussions that we had and how hard that was to leave.
[time=3106] And she knew where we were going.
[time=3109] Sarah didn't know where they were going and she went.
[time=3114] That whole story is kind of told in Genesis chapter 12 through 22, Karen and I were talking about it this week.
[time=3120] Share just some of the insights that you gleaned as you read through that whole account of how she responded to Abraham and even in his weakness and his failure.
[time=3131] - It was awesome just reading through those scriptures again because it's like we know in part that story, but then to read through it again in the reality that she was following a less than perfect man.
[time=3144] Sometimes we think if I had this husband leading, then it would be much easier to follow or if he made these decisions, then I could follow him.
[time=3153] But we have, here we have Abraham, good old Abe and he has his fears and he has his deals and she's been asked to follow him somewhere she doesn't know where.
[time=3164] And upfront, Abraham introduces to her this little reality.
[time=3169] We're gonna go into these foreign lands and you're a very beautiful woman and they might kill me if they know that you're my wife.
[time=3179] So I want you to tell everybody you're my sister and it would be like our husband saying to us, tell them we're friends.
[time=3188] It would be very demeaning.
[time=3190] She's not my wife, she's my friend.
[time=3193] Now there was some truth in that, a partial truth.
[time=3197] Abraham and Sarah had the same father but different mothers, but Abraham was scared and he said, just tell them you're my sister.
[time=3204] And the amazing thing of reading through those realities again were that Sarah followed Abraham.
[time=3212] She obeyed him, she responded to him.
[time=3216] And in that God protected her and the neat thing is that he continued to strengthen them in their marriage and in their movement because God is so interested in revealing his character to us about who he is in his faithfulness.
[time=3233] And he's so interested in doing that in marriage in the umbrella of a man's leadership and a woman following that in those situations he didn't even discipline Abraham.
[time=3245] That just overwhelmed me that he continued to prosper them and reveal more of himself to them because Sarah responded to Abraham.
[time=3256] So we have this picture of marriage and we come into marriage and the man has this umbrella of authority.
[time=3267] By God's design he is the head, he is the leader, he is the master, he is the Lord as scripture says.
[time=3277] He's got the umbrella.
[time=3280] Doesn't matter what he's like, what he does, what he doesn't do, he's got the umbrella.
[time=3286] And what do we do?
[time=3288] We come into marriage and we want to go.
[time=3289] We want to hold that umbrella.
[time=3293] And there's been an interesting transition.
[time=3298] Women used to go from the umbrella of authority and protection of their fathers into the protection of marriage.
[time=3306] But now women are living on their own longer and they come into marriage and here they are with their own little umbrella they think and they come in and they're gonna hold onto this just in case you never know.
[time=3320] And they're fighting over this and they've got this and then they walk out over and over again because he doesn't do it the way I want him to do it.
[time=3330] And I don't like the way he leads.
[time=3332] And ultimately we're deceived.
[time=3334] It's a lie because we don't have an umbrella.
[time=3337] We don't have one, God never gave us one.
[time=3340] And so we're walking around like this with our hand in the air and you know what this is?
[time=3347] This is defiance.
[time=3351] Numbers 15 talks about it.
[time=3354] In the Hebrew it says raised fist or clenched hand.
[time=3359] It was the one sin that there was no atonement for.
[time=3368] Because it blasphemes God and it defies God when we directly disobey him.
[time=3375] We miss God's blessing out here.
[time=3378] We cannot have his protection and provision out here.
[time=3382] We've gotta come back under the umbrella.
[time=3386] Can I just hold onto you?
[time=3388] - Sure.
[time=3389] (audience laughing) - I need to get in a proper position under this umbrella and you know what, this umbrella, I mean I don't know if it's gonna cover me.
[time=3397] I mean it's, you're not holding it in the right place but I'm gonna hold on and I'm gonna trust God to work through his plan that he's given.
[time=3408] - Yeah and let me just say this in closing.
[time=3411] This is a great picture and I wanna just say this to you ladies and I wanna say it with what's in my heart which is just nothing but respect and hope that we can keep working on this together.
[time=3423] From the guy's perspective, this right here, this function where she was just standing and all that that says and this that's ahead of me and all that's coming down and this you with me, this you may think I like this, you may think I want this, you may think I'm bold and courageous in this, I'm scared to death to do this.
[time=3448] And if there's one thing that helps me do this with a sense of confidence and courage, it's when there's one next to me who's holding on saying go get 'em and we'll do our best.
[time=3463] Not give me that thing, what are you thinking?
[time=3468] And that's just how that is.
[time=3471] This is an opportunity ladies, these six verses, an opportunity for you to grow and to understand better the perfect design.
[time=3481] Guys we're gonna come back next week and there are some things you're gonna have to be willing to listen to.
[time=3486] There will be some challenging principles that you're gonna have to do your best to embrace.
[time=3491] But let's do that together.
[time=3494] Thank Karen for her willingness to come and share.
[time=3496] And if you would, just stand.
[time=3501] Let's stand and close in a word of prayer.
[time=3504] Father God we're so grateful for the umbrella of grace.
[time=3508] So thankful that every one of us can walk under your loving and guiding care.
[time=3512] So thankful for times like this where we can search the scriptures and see again what it is you've called us to.
[time=3518] God give every woman, every wife, every man and husband in this room.
[time=3522] God give us humility.
[time=3524] A willingness to abide by what you have designed and where it's confusing and scary.
[time=3530] God may we grow in our relationship with you.
[time=3535] Not give ourselves to the task of changing the other.
[time=3539] God may we grow in our relationship and our trust in you and we'll thank you for all that that will bring and all the people agreed and said amen.
[time=3573] (silence)
