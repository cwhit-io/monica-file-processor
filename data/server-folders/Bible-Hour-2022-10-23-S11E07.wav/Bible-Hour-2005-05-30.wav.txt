[time=168] (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Father God, we come to you this morning and we proclaim that you are our shield or do you protect us?
[time=192] (upbeat music) We are a deliverer in our strong tongue.
[time=197] (upbeat music) (upbeat music) Father God, we love you this morning because you first loved us.
[time=206] (upbeat music) Your love is great and your love is wide.
[time=214] It's high and deep and Father God, we want to ponder it together this morning like your word tells us to do collectively and in Ephesians, God, we want to.
[time=224] (upbeat music) Drink deep this morning of your love.
[time=229] (upbeat music) And Father, we want to lavish our love for you back (upbeat music) and praise you for who you are.
[time=237] (upbeat music) Praise you for the things that you do.
[time=240] (upbeat music) Pray that you would be honored, God, that you would receive the glory and the honor and praise this morning.
[time=248] (upbeat music) No one else and nothing else deserves what you do.
[time=252] (upbeat music) And so we give it this morning.
[time=256] (upbeat music) Through the power of Jesus and through the power of your Holy Spirit, we pray these things.
[time=263] (upbeat music) [AMEN] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and I want to welcome you to our broadcast today.
[time=273] We're thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=275] We are so grateful for what we see God continuing to do here in this amazing family that he is growing.
[time=282] So thankful for the lives that are being changed and so very thankful for the privilege that is ours to be just a part of that.
[time=291] As I've told you in recent days, we're also really, really grateful for what we see God doing, not only here, but in the church of Fort Wayne.
[time=300] And we have recently instituted a segment here in the Bible Hour that we've entitled celebrating the church of Fort Wayne.
[time=309] There are a lot of wonderful churches filled with a lot of wonderful people who are giving themselves daily to this greatest endeavor of all.
[time=318] And I have the privilege today of being joined by a good friend, a good friend and fellow pastor and leader in the church here in Fort Wayne.
[time=328] This is pastor Phil Mortensen.
[time=330] And Phil is the pastor of a church known as the Love Church.
[time=334] And I have been ever since I came to Fort Wayne, so very encouraged by Phil.
[time=339] He has made a huge impact in my own life and in my own ministry.
[time=344] And I am so looking forward to Phil sharing with you today what God is doing at the Love Church.
[time=351] Phil, I know it's a unique and very special ministry.
[time=355] And I just can't wait for you to share with our people the things that God has done and is doing and the things that we believe he'll continue to do through the Love Church.
[time=365] Share with the people, if you will, kind of how the Love Church began.
[time=370] Share with the folks, kind of the story of the Love Church, how it started, how you got involved, and where it's gone since.
[time=377] We started in 1986.
[time=380] Love Church started in September in a living room.
[time=385] And we started with the blessings of a number of different pastors.
[time=389] We didn't start 'cause we were mad.
[time=390] We didn't start because we were upset.
[time=392] We didn't start as a church split.
[time=395] And it was a good, in fact, we just had a Sunday night service for a year.
[time=398] And we continued to attend a local church here with the pastor's blessing.
[time=402] And then it came time to start our Sunday morning service.
[time=405] We started with their blessing.
[time=407] So we started basically with the concept that there was one church and that the church had to be reaching out to the poor and the needy.
[time=415] And so we met in the unemployment building on Washington and Clay Street for 12 years.
[time=422] And we had 15 people, the very first Sunday morning that we met.
[time=426] But we had a vision to be a church family demonstrating the love of Christ to the needy.
[time=432] And the love of church would be 19 years old this coming September and we, with God's help, have continued to walk out our vision, which is to be a church family demonstrating the love of Christ to the needy.
[time=443] In 1997, we had the opportunity to buy an old warehouse located at 1331 Eastbury.
[time=450] And it has served not only as a church, but it's also served as a community center.
[time=457] And we are so grateful that once again, the churches banded together, worked together so that we can provide ministry, service opportunities for local churches to come in.
[time=470] Once a month, we pass out bread in the community.
[time=473] Last month, we had approximately 70 people passing out bread for a couple hours, probably, I think, six or seven different local churches.
[time=482] We have a couple that are coming now that didn't have a church home as a result of that bread giveaway.
[time=487] Put all the gospel track in.
[time=489] We prayed with many, many people and some of the government housing projects.
[time=493] And we just really believe Proverbs 19, 17 says that he that ministers to the poor lends to the Lord and the Lord will repay him.
[time=502] The Lord has promised to provide for those that provide for the needy.
[time=507] In fact, in Luke 14, it says, when you have a banquet, invite the poor, don't invite people that can invite you back, invite people that don't have the ability to bless you physically and then the Lord will bless you.
[time=518] And I believe that love churches is an example.
[time=520] The Love Community Center is an example of ministries that are Christ-centered and centers where the poor and the needy can come and hear the word of God and see the love of God demonstrated.
[time=531] And so we're real excited about the opportunity to be with you today.
[time=535] We've been in the facility that we're located in at 1331 Eastbury since 1997.
[time=541] That building was purchased by Christians from over 100 different local church congregations.
[time=548] And we've grown to, we're not, we're still not a real big congregation.
[time=553] We average about 140 on a typical Sunday morning and about 70 at night.
[time=557] And we use our Sunday night service to bring churches over to, in fact, we've been to Blackhawk on a number of occasions to have baptism services here.
[time=566] We're just so grateful for the church community.
[time=569] We pray together, we work together, we laugh together, we have fun together.
[time=572] And I just appreciate so much this opportunity to come and share a little bit about the history of Love Church.
[time=578] I know personally, just because I've had opportunity to be with Phil and Fran, we got to mention Fran.
[time=585] Fran has been Phil's wife, a faithful partner and a wonderful, I know addition to that ministry.
[time=594] You and Fran have been married for how many years?
[time=596] - 40, this come in July.
[time=597] - 40 years, Phil and Fran and those that help lead there at the Love Church, it's a remarkable setting, a wonderful group of people.
[time=606] And I know that there are needs that exist in that ministry, Phil, at the Love Church, just like there are needs anywhere.
[time=613] Some of the needs that you bump into maybe are unique in some ways, but either way, what are some of the ways in which our Bible hour audience, people in this area, what are some ways that we could pray for you?
[time=626] How could we come alongside that ministry?
[time=629] There may be some physical things that we could do.
[time=632] There could just be some prayer requests that you might wanna share today.
[time=636] Let the folks know how we could come alongside and encourage you.
[time=640] - Well, thanks, Kelly.
[time=641] We'll, you're gonna be interviewing a young man by the name of Dennis Kelly.
[time=646] And Dennis was a high school graduate, but he could not read his own diploma.
[time=652] And one Hoosier out of every six adults cannot read, is functionally illiterate.
[time=659] Now I come from a very stable, wonderful Christian home where the pastor would stand up and say, well, turning your Bible to Romans six or 1 Corinthians seven or whatever.
[time=667] Well, if you can't read, 1 Corinthians doesn't look any difference in second chronicles.
[time=672] And so Dennis will be sharing a little bit about his testimony about someone who taught him how to read the word of God.
[time=679] And we need people to tutor people.
[time=682] That's one of the things that actually would help people to learn to read.
[time=687] We have a lot of people that just don't have very many living skills.
[time=690] As I said, I come from a wonderful, stable Christian home, a godly father, a godly mom.
[time=697] But we have children in our church that don't even know who their dad is.
[time=700] We have a little boy that he's nine years old and he said that he wanted to commit suicide because his dad is in prison for 45 years for shooting his mother and his grandmother in the head.
[time=712] Some of the tragedies that we work with, but we believe it's not the government's responsibility and even beyond the parrot church organizations or social service agencies, we believe it's the church's job to represent Jesus Christ to the poor and the needy.
[time=728] And we need people to, well, we have a couple here from Black Hawk, Ireland and Linda Friesen who come over, they attend the early service and then they come over to a love church faithfully and teach the word of God.
[time=740] They're strong members here at Black Hawk.
[time=742] They send their kids to Black Hawk School, but they come over every Sunday morning and help us out.
[time=747] We've never had any competition.
[time=748] We've never had a struggle between the two church families and it's been wonderful.
[time=753] In fact, we've had people from 20 different churches that have attended their own service and then come over and help us or they'd help us and then they'd attend maybe their second service or an evening service or a Thursday night service or pass bread out on Saturday or teach people woodworking skills.
[time=768] We have exercise classes.
[time=770] We have literacy classes.
[time=772] We have 22 people right now taking GED classes.
[time=775] We're working together with the Hope Center, Judy Helpke, who's just a wonderful lady who runs this ministry and we have had nine ladies that have gotten and gotten full-time jobs as a result of that.
[time=787] We're always looking for people to donate food, donate clothes, donate finances, donate computers.
[time=794] Perhaps there's people in the audience that'd be interested in helping us write grants.
[time=799] One of the things that we would like to do, we'd like, we have about 22,000 feet of square feet.
[time=805] It isn't remodeled yet.
[time=807] There's no heat in this particular section of our building and once we're able to complete this facility, we really believe that we're gonna be touching thousands of inner city lives with the cooperation of the body of Christ.
[time=820] So there's much to do and there's much to pray about and we just love to have our viewers get involved.
[time=827] What an amazing list.
[time=829] I hope you were listening.
[time=831] Hope you got a sense there as Phil shared of the many, many ways that you could, we could continue to be a part of helping support and come alongside this amazing ministry that God has begun and is continuing through Phil and so many folks who give and serve faithfully there at the Love Church.
[time=850] If you would like to help, if you would like to attend, if you would like to in any way, maybe further this conversation, I'm gonna have the guys put the phone number and the address of the Love Church on the screen for you.
[time=863] We'll also make sure you see the service times and I know Phil and that family would love to speak with you.
[time=870] They'd love to have you come and visit and we are so very thankful for that family.
[time=875] They are a part of our family and we will continue to celebrate what God is doing in the Church of Fort Wayne as he comes and helps each of us in our endeavor to help seeking people find and follow Christ.
[time=890] Have a great week.
[time=891] - My name is Dennis Kelly.
[time=894] I've been with the Love Church going on 14 years.
[time=897] I wanna tell you how the Love Church has helped me.
[time=899] Well, I started off, I was invited to a Bible study and they asked me to read.
[time=906] I started to cry.
[time=908] They asked me what's wrong.
[time=909] I said, I can't read.
[time=912] You know, I tried to do it on my own, but that didn't work out.
[time=917] The Lord, I thank the Lord.
[time=919] He bought a Lutheran lady named Candy and it took about six months to learn how to read.
[time=927] She took me up to the library on two season Thursdays
[time=934] for two hours.
[time=935] She taught me how to read all the King James Bible.
[time=938] And then it took about now I can read.
[time=944] And God opened doors after that.
[time=946] You know, how to do a computers class.
[time=949] They took the vans, the beginning class and passed that.
[time=953] And I took the vans and passed that.
[time=955] And, you know, I'm working now being wheelchair people in the church on Sunday's mornings and evenings.
[time=964] And then the next goal in God's willing is to learn how to spell.
[time=973] You know, right now we need some people to come in to help people learn how to read 'cause there's some people right there that cannot read.
[time=980] - Hi, I'm Shari Marcy and I've been going to Love Church for almost three years now.
[time=986] It has made a tremendous difference in my life and made a big impact on my family's life.
[time=991] When I first started going, I was a single mother with four small children.
[time=995] And it was a need that I needed to be there and they reached out and they helped me.
[time=1001] Since then I've learned to listen to God and my relationship with him has just reached all bounds that I had no imagination that it would reach.
[time=1012] And I am doing and learning to serve him in so many different ways.
[time=1016] And Love Church has enabled me to have the freedom to use my gifts that God has given me and they mean something.
[time=1023] And I get to contribute to the lives of others.
[time=1026] And I get to share that God's love with everyone else.
[time=1029] I've helped out in the computer room.
[time=1031] I've been teaching computer classes in the community center.
[time=1034] I have taught Sunday school for the three to five year old classes.
[time=1039] And currently I'm working with another member to teach discipleship classes and they've just made such an impact.
[time=1046] And when you're a relationship with God grows, you grow in so many ways, ways that you don't imagine.
[time=1052] And Love Church has really given me the freedom to find myself and find what God has wanted me to do.
[time=1058] And I appreciate that so very much.
[time=1060] And I can help that I get to continue serving them and serving God in every way and doing his well.
[time=1066] - Hey, if you brought your Bibles this morning, please open up to first Peter chapter three.
[time=1071] Like I said, we're gonna continue on in our study of this great book.
[time=1075] And before we do that, let me just say this briefly to you.
[time=1079] I wanna make sure that you stop by the table today, the children's ministry table.
[time=1083] We've got some camps coming up this summer.
[time=1085] Golda Gold Soccer Camp, July 11th.
[time=1088] We've got in June the sure shots, girls basketball camp and the hot shots camp.
[time=1094] The deadlines for those are coming up here soon.
[time=1096] So make sure parents, you stop by, get your kids, get some friends and neighbors signed up.
[time=1100] We would love to make sure your kids are able to take part in that.
[time=1104] Well, like I said, we find ourselves kind of in a transition week here.
[time=1109] We have spent a couple of weeks looking at first Peter chapter three versus one to six.
[time=1115] And in these first six verses, we have seen God's design for a wife.
[time=1120] We have seen clearly stated here.
[time=1122] And I hope we were able to communicate it in a way that was encouraging and helpful to you as wives.
[time=1129] We saw there in those six verses, God's design, the way he would want you to come at this thing called marriage.
[time=1136] As we make our way through the passage, we come this morning to verse seven.
[time=1140] And in one verse, he took kind of six there on the wives.
[time=1145] He just takes one verse here for the men.
[time=1147] And I think that just kind of speaks to God's awareness of our simplicity.
[time=1152] I think he knows our capacity.
[time=1155] And I think he understands that we just need it said to us very, very clearly and very, very straight.
[time=1162] And guys, let me ensure you that he does.
[time=1165] The verse that we are about to study, the truth that you are about to maybe wrestle with again or be exposed to for the very first time.
[time=1173] Either way, it is really, really important truth.
[time=1177] And I hope today that your heart and your mind are open to what he would have for you today as you think about.
[time=1183] And as you consider being a man that holds the umbrella well.
[time=1188] That's right.
[time=1189] If you were here last week, you know that we, as we finished up our teaching there in verse six, we kind of left you with the example of an umbrella.
[time=1199] And it's really true in God's design, he has given men the privilege.
[time=1205] And let me say that to you again, guys.
[time=1207] He has given you and I as men the privilege of being responsible for, loving, caring for, leading, sacrificing for, treating with great gentleness and kindness and being strong for, being a protector of our wives.
[time=1224] You see, in God's design, he has placed an umbrella of grace and protection in your hand as a husband.
[time=1231] And as we talked about that last week, I mean, it became, I think, very clear that there are times when in marriage, a couple of things go very, very wrong.
[time=1243] There are a couple of downfalls.
[time=1246] I mean, a couple of things that can transpire.
[time=1248] And when these things transpire, God's design is broken.
[time=1252] God's design is usurped and calamity, oftentimes is the result.
[time=1259] We talked last week about how in God's design, he has put in the hands of men an umbrella.
[time=1267] And what happens is, two things to just remember here this morning, what happens is that there are times when, in light of what took place in the garden, in light of the sin there, in Genesis three, see, there is, as a result of that, there is this independence in the fallen nature of a woman.
[time=1284] In the fallen nature of a wife, there will be times when she thinks in her heart that she can really do it better, she can really make her way more successfully.
[time=1292] She, at times, in her frustration or even her hurt, steps out from underneath the umbrella, removes herself from God's design for this relationship.
[time=1305] And in removing herself, doesn't just remove herself from a guy who may be having a hard time doing what he's supposed to do, being who he's supposed to be.
[time=1315] No, she removes herself from God's design.
[time=1318] That brings all kinds of challenges and struggles.
[time=1323] Now on the husband's side of this thing, I wanna just make sure we're all clear on this.
[time=1328] There are times when a wife will struggle with this design that God has called her to follow as she comes alongside and trusts in God.
[time=1338] Well, you know what, there are times when we as men, there are times when we as husbands don't handle this whole umbrella thing very well.
[time=1349] I'll just give you a couple of examples.
[time=1350] There are times when, and you've seen this and I've seen it, there are some guys and we can blame wiring and we can call it personality, but you know what, it's just sin on our part as men.
[time=1363] There are times when we don't even wanna touch it.
[time=1366] There are times, there are husbands in this room.
[time=1371] We have all at times struggled with the notion of just looking at that umbrella, realizing the responsibility that comes with it, knowing what may take place as I try to hold it and do a good job and so in my fear and in my self-protection, 'cause I don't wanna get in those spots, I just say, forget it.
[time=1390] I'm not gonna hold the umbrella.
[time=1393] And that leads the calamity.
[time=1399] 'Cause guys like it or not, he gave you the umbrella and he calls you and I to hold it.
[time=1405] And if we don't, it's not as he designed it and it never works.
[time=1413] There are some husbands who they may hold on to it.
[time=1418] Second guy, I want you to think of in your mind, there are some guys who are like, okay, I'll hold it and they hold on to it and alongside of them is their wife and they kind of walk their way through whatever they're going through, but you know what?
[time=1431] Tension comes, a conflict takes place.
[time=1435] There's a scenario that unfolds.
[time=1438] And it's not going so well.
[time=1440] And in the conflict and the tension, what some men will do and I see this often is they'll say, here, you take it.
[time=1450] It's not even so much, it's not even so much the wife ripping it out of his hand.
[time=1454] Sometimes just men in our own weakness will just say out of fear, 'cause we've had the conversations.
[time=1462] We know where it's gonna go.
[time=1463] We don't wanna deal with it.
[time=1465] It's too much complication.
[time=1466] Maybe too much hassle.
[time=1467] So we say, here, you take it.
[time=1469] And she wasn't designed to take it.
[time=1474] You were.
[time=1477] And so whether you never picked it up or whether you just give it away too quickly, either way God's design gets thwarted.
[time=1484] Then there's a third guy.
[time=1487] Then there's a guy who really likes holding the umbrella.
[time=1490] In fact, he likes it too much.
[time=1493] You know that guy?
[time=1495] I mean, there's a third kind of guy who, you know what, by golly, I'm gonna hold the umbrella and you're gonna fall in line 'cause I am the umbrella holder.
[time=1504] (laughs) Shave up!
[time=1507] And you know what, that guy, he usually holds the umbrella.
[time=1510] The responsibility is to care for, provide, protect and help those.
[time=1514] This guy usually holds the umbrella right in the middle.
[time=1517] 'Cause he tends to kind of lose perspective and he thinks it's about keeping himself dry when in reality, he's supposed to be leading and loving in a way where sacrificially he's helping others stay dry, but he does this.
[time=1530] And he's not really, usually he's got some blinders on.
[time=1533] Have you seen that guy?
[time=1534] And he's kind of just walking around, right?
[time=1536] And he's making his turns and he's doing his thing and before he realizes he looks back and he's got a really, really, soap wife who's out there getting killed by the rain
[time=1550] 'cause he's not really paying attention.
[time=1552] But by golly, he is the umbrella holder.
[time=1555] Amen?
[time=1556] Man, sometimes we really, really get it wrong.
[time=1560] So today, we wanna try our best as men to look at the scriptures and get it right.
[time=1566] We're gonna do our very best to give you a picture here of what it looks like.
[time=1569] First Peter three, verse seven.
[time=1570] Would you stand in honor of God's word?
[time=1573] And let me read this to you.
[time=1574] First Peter three, seven.
[time=1575] Says in first Peter three, seven, it says, "You husbands, in the same way, "live with your wives in an understanding way "as with someone weaker since she is a woman "and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life "so that your prayers will not be hindered." Would you pray with me this morning?
[time=1599] Father God, we stand before you.
[time=1600] We stand before you as the family of God.
[time=1604] I know in this room, there are many husbands.
[time=1607] There are many men.
[time=1608] Some have been husbands, God, for a short time.
[time=1611] Others have been at this for years and there are still others in this room who aren't husbands yet, but they may be.
[time=1618] God, I pray that you would help us today.
[time=1622] I would speak on behalf of all husbands or at least want to this morning as I would say, God, with great humility and need, we reach out to you, knowing that there are times when we don't love and lead and sacrifice as you've called us to.
[time=1637] God, knowing there are times when the umbrella isn't held as you designed it to be.
[time=1643] And God, we pray that you would move in us, God, that you would remind us, God, that you would teach us to be men who love their wives.
[time=1652] God, that we could in that relationship with her model, the relationship and love, God, that you have for us.
[time=1659] God, please show us whatever we might need to see.
[time=1663] And we'll thank you for it in your son's name, we pray.
[time=1666] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1669] Hey, let me, if I can, just before we jump into the outline this morning, let me just show you one thing.
[time=1674] I think that's very important as we begin this teaching.
[time=1677] I wanna ask you if you would to look at verse seven there.
[time=1680] And I want you, as you look at verse seven, listen, listen, I want you to think about the context that verse seven falls in.
[time=1689] I want you to think about the last six verses and what it's been about.
[time=1694] I want you to think about the verses even prior to chapter three and what they were about.
[time=1701] And I'll give you a little, I'll give you a little hint.
[time=1703] The verses prior to chapter three were about the ultimate example that Christ gave as he modeled an attitude of suffering, as he modeled a willingness to submit, as he gave us this perfect example of one who conducted himself in the midst of great trauma and adversity, he modeled graciousness and kindness.
[time=1725] We didn't speak a word, you remember?
[time=1728] And then we come to chapter three, verses one to six, and it said in the same way, you wives, and then we went into this study and this discussion of submission and this spirit, this attitude that God can use to reach the heart of a disobedient husband and bring him back.
[time=1747] It wasn't about her words, it was about her heart and her spirit.
[time=1750] And now I want you to look at verse seven, 'cause we oftentimes just blow right past this.
[time=1756] Verse seven, you husbands, and I want every guy in this room to out loud say the next four words, go.
[time=1764] Stop, say it again.
[time=1766] You guys see that?
[time=1768] Husbands in the same way in the same way,
[time=1776] with the same spirit, with the same attitude,
[time=1785] with the same intention, with the same willingness, with the same graciousness.
[time=1793] Oftentimes we kind of move away from the first six verses and the call on the wife to function with this attitude, and then we boom, go into the, and we go past those four words too quickly.
[time=1803] You husbands, same thing we saw in Christ, the same thing we've seen wives call to this attitude of graciousness and kindness and respect in the same way.
[time=1817] Live with your wives, here's our first point, write this down, live with your wives in an understanding way, better yet write this down, holding the umbrella well is what we've entitled our discussion today.
[time=1830] Write this down, hold it with understanding, men.
[time=1833] Number one, hold it with understanding in the same way.
[time=1837] Live with your wives in an understanding way.
[time=1842] Now I've tried my best as I've read this week and as I've studied and as I've looked through the different resources and I've had conversations with different ones of you and people in my life, I mean we could go for hours today about this one point.
[time=1856] I've tried my best to kind of whittle this down guys, I want you to leave today with something very practical and something very useful because I know, I know the challenge of living with a wife in an understanding way.
[time=1872] And so as I've thought about this, I've just kind of whittled it down to a few things I wanna make sure you get today.
[time=1877] So here you go.
[time=1878] As best as I can tell, as I've read and listened and had discussions with others, if you're going to leave your wife feeling as if, sensing as if, she's in a relationship with an understanding man, there are some very important things you and I have to give ourselves to.
[time=1897] Number one would be this, write this down, you and I have got to be men who listen.
[time=1901] We have got to be men who listen.
[time=1905] And I wanna just say this to, you know, even those in the room that aren't married yet, if you're a 15 year old, 16 year old, 18 year old, young adult, not only is this the kind of man, young men, not only is this the kind of man that you and I should be striving to be, but young ladies, this is the kind of man, one with these traits, one with this kind of character, a man with this kind of heart, this is the guy who you should be interested in someday.
[time=1939] This is the kind of guy that God has designed to be a loving husband.
[time=1943] He holds the umbrella with understanding.
[time=1945] Number one, he listens, now watch this guys, he listens, first of the bullet point I've got here is, he listens to the whole story.
[time=1954] He listens to the whole story, you ladies know, that oftentimes you have it on your heart to share with him about the interaction you had with this certain friend today.
[time=1966] You wanna tell him about what happened at work.
[time=1968] You can't wait to kind of get off your chest, what transpired with one of the kids.
[time=1972] Something happened, there was some event, there was some email, something took place and it's kind of filled up your heart and you wanna get it out and you wanna tell him the story.
[time=1982] And so many times guys, we are so prone to halfway through the story, interrupt.
[time=1989] For a number of reasons, we've got it all figured out, we're in a hurry, we wanna kind of tidy this thing up because there's things to do and yet what is taking place right there in front of us is an opportunity, an opportunity to connect at a very, very important level.
[time=2007] Listen to the whole story, wait until she's done, it might take five minutes, it might take 10, it could take 15, depends upon who your wife is.
[time=2017] But the point is, listen to the whole story and you know what, you wanna really minister to her, you wanna really encourage her when she gets done with the story, ask her to tell it to you again 'cause you wanna make sure you didn't miss something.
[time=2035] And you know what she'll do?
[time=2038] She'll tell you the story again.
[time=2041] Willingly, happily, just so encouraged.
[time=2045] Watch this number two, this is so important.
[time=2048] As you listen and live with her in an understanding way, you are to connect the story's impact.
[time=2057] You are to connect, the whole point of the story is to be connected back to her heart.
[time=2064] I'll just say that to you again.
[time=2067] And here I'll say it to you this way, she's telling you there is a reason, she's telling you the story and it has absolutely zero to do with the data in the story, the conclusion of the story or where to go from the end of the story.
[time=2085] She is telling you the story because she wants to share with you how the story has left her feeling.
[time=2092] She may be confused, she may be excited, she may be frustrated, she may be angry, she may be at her wits in, she may, she could be all the above.
[time=2103] That's why she's telling you the story.
[time=2106] And you have an opportunity there to connect the story's impact back to her heart.
[time=2114] See, problem is guys so many times, halfway through the story, we're beginning to connect the impact of the story to how much the story is gonna cost us at the end of the story.
[time=2128] We're already running dollar signs.
[time=2131] Or as she talks, we're realizing that the story and its impact is going to require a great deal of time from us.
[time=2139] It's gonna mean we're gonna have to go do something possibly.
[time=2142] The greatest thing that happens in the mind of a man as the story's being told though, is that he is, as she's talking, he is putting together in his mind, point by point, the solution to her story.
[time=2154] Which is why there's oftentimes the interruption because we're so bright, right?
[time=2158] We just figure it out and we wanna save her the heartache.
[time=2161] We wanna save her the frustration.
[time=2162] Doesn't work.
[time=2166] It's not why she's telling you the story.
[time=2169] She's telling you the story because she wants to share with you and have you understand how it all made her feel which leads to our third point, which is so very challenging.
[time=2178] Maybe the greatest challenge.
[time=2180] I call it one of, I call it the 45 second challenge because this right here happens in about 45 seconds.
[time=2187] 30 seconds to a minute.
[time=2190] And you and I have either done this or we haven't.
[time=2193] And if we don't, we've missed her.
[time=2195] You listen to empathize.
[time=2199] You listen to connect.
[time=2205] You listen with the intention of relating with her.
[time=2209] Which means you have to listen through whose ears, whose heart, hers.
[time=2218] Now here's how this, I can listen.
[time=2219] Please, ladies, don't laugh at me.
[time=2221] I'm gonna try my best to do this.
[time=2223] I am a work in progress.
[time=2224] I don't always do this well.
[time=2225] So I'm just kind of taking a stab at this, right?
[time=2228] So here's what it might look like.
[time=2230] The story gets told.
[time=2231] And it might have been a really, really, it could have been a really bad story.
[time=2236] It could have been a really sad story.
[time=2237] It could have been a very, very, very discouraging story.
[time=2239] So it means 30 seconds, guys.
[time=2242] It means maybe you and I just leaning forward and saying something like, wow, I am so sorry that that happened.
[time=2257] That stinks.
[time=2261] Or it could have been a really exciting story.
[time=2267] With a great ending.
[time=2268] And so we might be prone, and I would be prone in my heart if it's a really exciting story.
[time=2272] With a great ending, they go in my mind, okay, good.
[time=2274] We're done with that.
[time=2275] Good, she's happy.
[time=2276] I'm gonna move on to what I was doing.
[time=2278] And so at the end of a really exciting story, it might just be you lingering there and saying, wow.
[time=2283] Really?
[time=2286] That's amazing.
[time=2288] So like, what are you gonna do?
[time=2291] This is so cool.
[time=2293] Tell me.
[time=2294] They do okay?
[time=2298] I've been practicing all week.
[time=2299] Do they do okay?
[time=2300] (audience laughs) What, no, no, no, no, please.
[time=2304] Here's another thing you gotta remember.
[time=2309] In the empathy opportunity.
[time=2311] And I've learned this one the hard way.
[time=2316] Sometimes a question you might wanna ask is, so what are you, maybe it was confusing what she just told you.
[time=2322] Maybe she just doesn't know what to do.
[time=2324] Which is just, we are set up as men there.
[time=2328] Because we know what you should do.
[time=2330] But she doesn't know what to do.
[time=2331] So here's the hardest question a husband can ever utter is to sit there and say to her, so, wow, what are you gonna do?
[time=2344] And why is I want you to think about what it would be like to hear those words?
[time=2351] See, I'm tapping my arm, 'cause I know the answer.
[time=2354] And I'm trying my back, but to be able to say to her, wow, so what are you gonna do?
[time=2359] And then she may give an answer.
[time=2361] And in your mind you may think, oh no, don't do that.
[time=2363] But you gotta hang in there for the 45 seconds.
[time=2367] You gotta stay at it there for the minute or two.
[time=2369] 'Cause the whole point of the story, she wants to know how she feels.
[time=2375] And if she can sense that you really do understand that, or that at least you're trying, so many good things can come from that.
[time=2383] You know, it's an amazing thing.
[time=2385] And this is not a trick, ladies.
[time=2389] And I'm not playing games here.
[time=2390] And guys, this is not a formula.
[time=2392] It doesn't always go this way.
[time=2395] I have just experienced this, and I've seen it.
[time=2398] That if you as a husband were really willing to listen to the whole story, maybe even twice, if you as a husband were willing to connect the story, not to your pocketbook, or what it may do to your schedule, but to her heart.
[time=2415] And if you're willing to just respond in a way that would communicate a degree of empathy, my experience has been sometimes within an hour.
[time=2427] They're coming back to you and asking you to help them fix it.
[time=2435] 'Cause you know what?
[time=2437] They know that you can help them with that, but they're not wanting that initially.
[time=2443] Initially, you and I have got to be men who listen, men who learn, write this down.
[time=2450] I thought this was very insightful.
[time=2452] I heard this from a number of gals that I talked with this week.
[time=2455] If you're gonna live with her in an understanding way, you have got to be a man that learns, learns, learns about her.
[time=2462] We wanna study our wives.
[time=2465] We wanna know them.
[time=2467] You wanna learn her, watch this.
[time=2469] You wanna learn her favorites.
[time=2470] Write this down.
[time=2471] I would challenge any guy in the room today to go home either before you leave or in the car when you get home, write down her favorite flower, her favorite movie, her favorite color, her favorite restaurant, and her favorite ice cream.
[time=2483] Can you do that?
[time=2484] Her favorites, flower, movie, color, restaurant, ice cream.
[time=2487] Tally up your scores, come back and talk to me next week.
[time=2489] We'll celebrate your win or mourn over your loss.
[time=2493] You gotta learn.
[time=2496] You gotta know.
[time=2498] No, I didn't know, I couldn't figure out a good word here.
[time=2500] Her systems.
[time=2502] And here's what I mean by that.
[time=2504] Most wives have a way that they fold linens.
[time=2509] Most wives have a way that the dishwasher usually gets loaded.
[time=2513] Most wives have systems.
[time=2515] They have ways of doing things.
[time=2518] And a lot of times the way they do, whether it's the garage, whether it's their bathroom, whether it's where things get put away, a lot of times as men, we come into these arenas and we just wanna do it our way.
[time=2531] I mean, at least we're doing it, right?
[time=2532] No, no, no, no, no.
[time=2533] Show sensitivity, understand, no.
[time=2536] Take the extra effort to know where the serving spoon goes and put it where it goes and try your best at whatever level you can help her.
[time=2544] At whatever level you're able to come alongside her, do your best to honor.
[time=2548] It's not a right or wrong thing.
[time=2550] Forks can go in the dishwasher up.
[time=2552] They can go in the dishwasher down.
[time=2554] It doesn't really matter.
[time=2556] But whatever it is, have a willingness to so know how she likes some things done that you just wanna help.
[time=2565] Learn her favorites, learn her system.
[time=2567] Here you go, learn her fears.
[time=2569] You know what guys?
[time=2571] Your wife, your wife, who she is, how she was raised, where she comes from, the things that she has been through, your deals that she has persevered through, the family situation she comes out of, your wife has unique anxieties.
[time=2592] There are issues in the heart and soul of your wife that are unique to her.
[time=2598] And not only do you need to know what they are, not only do you need to take the time to have the conversations, to understand them, but you have to know how to respond to them.
[time=2611] See, God wants your wife to live in peace.
[time=2614] God says, cast all your anxieties on me.
[time=2617] God wants your wife to live her life, not gripped by fear, not gripped by uncertainty.
[time=2624] No, God wants your wife to live in peace in relationship with him.
[time=2628] And guess what?
[time=2629] He has called you into her life to help that come to fruition, to be a man who lives with his wife in an understanding way.
[time=2640] Okay, I wanna just do it like this.
[time=2644] Steve Gardener, would you come up here, please?
[time=2647] We'll just do a couple of visuals here, okay?
[time=2649] I'm gonna ask Steve Gardener if he'd come and grab this umbrella.
[time=2653] Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
[time=2654] Just grab that.
[time=2655] Would you just stand right there first?
[time=2657] Stand right there first.
[time=2658] And I'm just gonna give you this big old man, this is a textbook right here.
[time=2662] It's got Maria written on the cover, right there.
[time=2664] I want you to hold that book right there.
[time=2666] All right.
[time=2667] Now, book of fears, yep, absolutely.
[time=2668] You hold that right there.
[time=2670] And this is the textbook.
[time=2672] This is his wife.
[time=2673] This is the opportunity and privilege.
[time=2675] God has given this husband to hold an umbrella well.
[time=2679] Part of that is studying.
[time=2681] Part of it is knowing.
[time=2682] Part of it is acquiring knowledge as to who she is and how she's wired.
[time=2687] And he gives this study, great effort.
[time=2690] All right, just sit down there.
[time=2692] Have a seat, relax.
[time=2693] You can fold the book up for a second.
[time=2695] Number two, hold it with strength.
[time=2697] Hold it with strength.
[time=2699] Guys, if you wanna hold the umbrella well, hold it with strength.
[time=2702] Look what it says there in verse seven.
[time=2704] Live with your wives in an understanding way as with someone weaker since she is a woman.
[time=2711] Now, a lot is said about this verse.
[time=2713] I hear so many antagonists who wanna take this and make this out to be some kind of prejudice that God has against women, some kind of a degrading or demeaning thing.
[time=2724] You know, let me just try my best to clear this up.
[time=2726] Please, in the context of this passage, I hope it is absolutely clear to you that God is trying to communicate something here that honors women, that supports women, that he's trying to cast a picture here of a design that he has for marriage whereby wives get treated well with great respect and honor.
[time=2749] He's not demeaning women.
[time=2750] You know what?
[time=2751] Physically, you're weaker.
[time=2755] I don't know if there's somebody in here who wants to argue that.
[time=2760] I'll arm wrestle you if you want to.
[time=2762] I'm stronger than you.
[time=2765] Now, could there be a woman who could beat me in arm wrestling?
[time=2770] Yes, there probably could be.
[time=2772] But that's not the point.
[time=2773] The point with me, it's just physically, and now watch this emotionally, and now be careful, don't go too far.
[time=2780] Emotionally, what's being said there, and I think every woman in this room would agree with me, that emotionally, a woman, the way that she has been wired, and the way that she thinks, she can be in comparison to a man.
[time=2796] She can, at times, be more susceptible to emotional conflict.
[time=2800] Did I say that well?
[time=2802] She's more complicated.
[time=2806] There's potential for more stress.
[time=2809] There's deeper feelings.
[time=2811] There's potentially more anxiety.
[time=2813] There's greater levels of fear, confusion, and what ifs?
[time=2817] I call them what ifs.
[time=2819] I don't know if your wife does this.
[time=2822] I don't know, I think mine left after first hour, so I can say this with great freedom now.
[time=2829] No, I said it first hour, too.
[time=2830] It's just amazing to me, and we can laugh about it.
[time=2833] If I call a buddy and say, "Would you like to play golf?" and he says, "No." I say, "Okay, thanks." And I hang up.
[time=2840] If a wife calls another friend and says, "Hey, would you like to go to lunch?" And the friend says, "No, I can't." She hangs up the phone and goes, "Huh." I wonder why she said no.
[time=2851] (audience laughs) Huh, I know why she said no.
[time=2857] She said no, because she thinks I did this, and I bet if she thinks I did that, I bet she's talked to so and so and so and so and so, and now they all think the same thing about me.
[time=2866] Oh my goodness.
[time=2872] There's just a scenario, I call it scenarioing, right?
[time=2876] It's just, gosh, sometimes it just gets out of hand.
[time=2879] And there are times, watch this.
[time=2881] Here's the point, there are times when she needs you, husband, to put your arms, maybe they're confused arms.
[time=2890] Maybe they're arms that don't quite know what to do, but there are times because of this fragility.
[time=2897] There are times when she needs you to put your arms around her.
[time=2901] Hold on to her hand tightly, and say, "I love you," and I'm not quite sure what's going on, but if I can help, please let me.
[time=2911] We can tackle this together.
[time=2915] Physically and emotionally,
[time=2921] an opportunity for you to be strong.
[time=2923] Physically, I kind of skipped that.
[time=2926] You know what we're talking about here, folks?
[time=2928] We're just talking about chivalry.
[time=2930] It's just hold the door, drop her off at the curb, go get the car, carry the mulch, lift the load.
[time=2940] You know what I'm saying?
[time=2941] Just do whatever you can do in the physical realm to just try and make her experience, her and her existence a little bit more come.
[time=2950] Take the garbage out, let her go first, lock the doors at night.
[time=2955] You with me?
[time=2957] All right, another umbrella.
[time=2960] Where'd my other umbrellas go?
[time=2961] Oh, here they are.
[time=2962] Tim Bland, will you come up here real quick?
[time=2966] Thank you, sir.
[time=2967] I love it when people sit in the front.
[time=2969] There you go, my friend.
[time=2971] I want you to stand right there.
[time=2973] That's Umbrella malfunctioned first hour, so if it does something to you weird, just hang on.
[time=2978] All right, Tim, stand up.
[time=2979] Okay, hold this right there.
[time=2980] Strength, right, there you go.
[time=2983] There's your picture.
[time=2984] He's holding the umbrella, and he's gonna do it with strength.
[time=2988] Strength that doesn't serve him.
[time=2990] Strength that serves others, namely his wife.
[time=2994] He's holding the umbrella well.
[time=2996] This man is a student of his wife.
[time=2999] She was designed by God to be studied by you.
[time=3002] And she was designed by God to be protected by you, physically and emotionally.
[time=3008] Let me say this, I do not mean she's weaker mentally.
[time=3013] Please hear that.
[time=3013] My wife, my wife is so, thanks Tim, you can sit down.
[time=3017] My wife is so much smarter than me.
[time=3021] It's not even funny.
[time=3022] Mentally, she is just miles ahead.
[time=3025] If we did the SAT again, you know, it wouldn't be funny.
[time=3029] I mean, it's just absolute, yeah.
[time=3032] I'm not talking about brains here.
[time=3035] Talking about physical emotional makeup.
[time=3038] Number three, hold it with respect.
[time=3040] Number three, write this down.
[time=3043] You gotta hold it, guys.
[time=3044] You wanna be a good Umbrella holder.
[time=3046] You gotta hold it with respect.
[time=3049] Look at verse seven, you husbands in the same way.
[time=3052] Live with your wives in an understanding way as with someone weaker since she is a woman and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life so that your prayers will not be hindered.
[time=3067] Guys, hold it with respect.
[time=3070] Husbands, make sure, this is the point, husbands, you gotta make sure she's not getting wet.
[time=3078] Which means you're gonna have to have your head on a swivel.
[time=3082] You're gonna have to have your head and your vision constantly seeing how it's gone.
[time=3088] How are things progressing?
[time=3089] How's she doing?
[time=3090] You and I can get so far down the road as men
[time=3096] with our Umbrella squarely in the middle.
[time=3098] And God has called you to be one who holds that with great respect and honor.
[time=3105] Treat her with honor.
[time=3106] Guys, talk nicely.
[time=3110] Be patient.
[time=3113] Always extend kindness in your interactions.
[time=3116] You know what is so sad?
[time=3117] And I've, you know what?
[time=3121] I have seen this and I have done this.
[time=3124] And I wish that weren't the case, but it's true.
[time=3129] I have seen husbands treat clients, customers or buddies better than they treat their wives.
[time=3138] I have seen husbands who in the way they interact with
[time=3144] and the way they would speak to and the way they would address their, I have seen them treat wives in ways they would never dream of treating a buddy or a client or a customer.
[time=3159] She, my friends, she is a fellow heir.
[time=3163] She is a precious child of God.
[time=3166] And I will say this, lots to say on this point, but let me just say this.
[time=3172] In most situations, as a husband interacts with a wife,
[time=3178] in many, not all, but in many of those situations, there are a group of individuals watching and that group of individuals are called kids.
[time=3189] And I cannot begin to tell you how concerned I am.
[time=3194] As I begin to watch more and more, 10-year-olds, 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, boys, and the way they treat and the way they speak to women.
[time=3210] And guys, that is all on you
[time=3216] because they will treat them and they will speak to them and they will handle that in the way that I did and in the way that you did.
[time=3226] And whatever they see you doing, however it is they see you responding, the way you hold the umbrella, you can be guaranteed.
[time=3235] They will hold it that way or be prone to.
[time=3238] And then, you know, there's gonna have to be a whole lot of work done.
[time=3242] And so it is an encouragement.
[time=3243] I'm encouraging you guys, be so very careful in the way you hold that umbrella.
[time=3249] Treat her with respect.
[time=3252] Treat her with honor.
[time=3254] Wives your desire should be to serve him back.
[time=3259] You see, this is all about, I'm gonna give this to you unconditionally.
[time=3266] And it's all about you as a wife being willing to unconditionally, see, if we're unconditionally giving it back and forth, wow, what a sweet thing.
[time=3277] But it's not, you know, it's not a, it's not, I'm gonna give it if, it's gonna, I'm gonna give this to you.
[time=3282] I'm gonna hold this umbrella this way.
[time=3284] Wives serve him, wives honor him, wives understand him.
[time=3288] And let me just let you in on a secret before we close.
[time=3292] I'm gonna ask, actually let me ask one more guy.
[time=3293] Okay, Matt, would you come here for a second?
[time=3295] Where's the last umbrella?
[time=3296] Here it is.
[time=3297] On the honor, trust and respect.
[time=3301] Let's just do this.
[time=3303] It is, don't you hold that buddy?
[time=3306] And if you'll stand right there in front of that stool, we've kind of used this symbol in the past.
[time=3311] Hold your arm up here.
[time=3312] That's just a great symbol right there.
[time=3316] That just says, you know what?
[time=3317] Sweetheart, I am here to serve.
[time=3320] I'm here to help, I'm here to do whatever I can.
[time=3324] And I'm gonna do it in a way that honors you.
[time=3327] I am gonna do it in a way that serves you.
[time=3329] I'm gonna do it as best I can.
[time=3332] Now, all of you stand up, please.
[time=3333] Here's the point, I wanted to say this.
[time=3335] Wives, we are not, as husbands, we are not complicated.
[time=3341] It is really with us, it's profoundly simple.
[time=3345] And I'm speaking for every husband in this room.
[time=3350] We long to be, we do.
[time=3352] And I know we may not act like it at times.
[time=3354] But we long to be your hero.
[time=3361] That's the way God made us.
[time=3362] We want like nothing else to be.
[time=3365] We wanna be the knight in shining armor.
[time=3370] We want in our hearts, it's the way God designed us.
[time=3373] See, down deep inside, we want to be your champion.
[time=3376] And guys, we need to hold the umbrella this way
[time=3383] as we move toward that.
[time=3384] Ladies, remember, remember we die a thousand deaths
[time=3390] when you compare us because we can't ever, ever match up.
[time=3395] It means the world to us when you say thanks.
[time=3404] Not thanks for accomplishing, but thanks for trying.
[time=3409] Thanks, just thank yous, go a long, long way.
[time=3416] And if you'll say thanks and if you'll rub our shoulders and make a sandwich, we're really happy.
[time=3423] How did I, how did I do there?
[time=3426] Did I, did I do okay guys?
[time=3430] Shoulder rub sandwich and a thank you, right?
[time=3433] Listen, thanks, there you go.
[time=3435] I know that you need more than that back from us.
[time=3438] That's why six versus versus one, right?
[time=3440] But that's okay, we're gonna do our best.
[time=3443] But coming back, it's not that complicated.
[time=3446] And men, I hope that you will be willing to give yourself wholeheartedly.
[time=3452] And if you need help, ask, last point, maybe the most important point of the passage, don't forget the last line.
[time=3459] We blow right past this.
[time=3461] If you go back to verse seven, you see something very interesting.
[time=3464] Live with your wife in an understanding way as with someone weaker since she is a woman and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers, oh my goodness, so that your prayers will not be hindered.
[time=3477] How important is this to God?
[time=3480] My friends, God says that your communication with him, God says your relationship with him is hindered when you as a husband aren't willing to live with your wife this way.
[time=3493] Huge, absolutely huge.
[time=3498] Think about it, if you need some help, ask.
[time=3501] We've got guys who can come alongside you, couples.
[time=3504] We've got home groups, we'd love to put you in so you can further live out and learn about these truths.
[time=3509] God's designed for marriage, what an amazing, what an amazing gift he's given us.
[time=3516] Would you stand and let's close in a word of prayer?
[time=3519] Father God, we pray humbling that you would teach us as husbands and wives with so much at stake.
[time=3528] God with so much on the line, God please teach us.
[time=3532] Bring those people into our lives that we need.
[time=3535] God bring the conviction that needs to come.
[time=3537] God give us humble hearts to admit our failures.
[time=3541] And God give us a tenacious spirit guided by your truth and your spirit that would allow us to learn things that we've never learned, work at stuff that we've always avoided.
[time=3553] God please allow our marriages to be a representation of your great love for us and our relationship with you and we'll thank you for it in your son's precious name.
[time=3563] And they all agreed and said, amen.
[time=3587] (silence)
