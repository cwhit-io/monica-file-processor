[time=30] (dramatic music) (upbeat music)
[time=60] (upbeat music) - Okay, you ready?
[time=86] Now this is gonna be interactive.
[time=88] It's gonna be some sounds, all right?
[time=91] There's gonna be some pictures drawn by a great picture maker, okay?
[time=97] And they're gonna be on the screen, okay?
[time=99] So you ready?
[time=100] I'm gonna tell you a story today about Jonah, okay?
[time=105] Everybody say Jonah.
[time=107] All right, the Bible says that God came to Jonah
[time=113] and he said, Jonah, go.
[time=116] - Go.
[time=117] - Wait a minute, what did he say?
[time=121] - Go.
[time=122] - One more time.
[time=125] - Go.
[time=126] - God told Jonah to go to Nineveh.
[time=131] It was a big city where there are a lot of people doing bad things.
[time=135] So you ever have anybody in your life that does bad things?
[time=139] Well, sometimes God might tell you to go to that person and love that person, right?
[time=144] Well, he told Jonah to go to a whole big city the whole lot of bad people and go love those people go show them the mercy that God gave Jonah, okay?
[time=152] Does that make sense?
[time=154] See, each one of us has inside a radio transmitter.
[time=159] Does anybody here ever listen to the radio?
[time=163] Does anybody here ever listen like 88.3?
[time=166] All right, what happens when you turn it to 88.1?
[time=170] - Oh, that's so ugly, ah, you don't can't quite hear
[time=176] what's going on.
[time=177] If you turn to 88.4, you hear.
[time=180] (mumbling) And you just can't get, but if you turn to 88.3, you hear the message.
[time=188] Jonah's transmitter, his spirit inside of him, was a little fuzzy.
[time=192] And sometimes that'll happen to us.
[time=194] Our transmitter gets a little fuzzy, not dial in to what God's saying to us.
[time=198] And so this is what we do.
[time=199] We hear God say-- - Go.
[time=202] - And we say, and we say-- - No.
[time=208] (screaming) - Right, we say no.
[time=212] What do we say?
[time=213] - No.
[time=214] - What's that sir?
[time=215] (screaming) See, God told Jonah to go that way.
[time=220] Jonah went that way.
[time=223] Oh, that's not good, that's disobedience.
[time=226] He needed to obey, but he disobeying, right?
[time=229] Okay, so God says-- - Go.
[time=233] - Jonah says-- (screaming) And it goes the other way, right?
[time=238] Here's today's story message.
[time=242] When God says go, we don't want to say no, we want to say yo, no, no, no, say it's got a rhyme or it would be good, all right?
[time=252] He's got to say yo, I'll go.
[time=255] So everybody say that, yo, I'll go.
[time=258] No, that's much better, like you mean it.
[time=260] God says go and you're going to say-- - Go.
[time=263] - Go.
[time=264] - And the parents are going to say-- - Go.
[time=267] - Go.
[time=268] - Because you're transmitter, your spirit's dialing to God.
[time=271] All right, okay, so Jonah goes the other way and he gets on a boat and he hides from God.
[time=276] And all of a sudden, something happens while he's on that boat.
[time=279] Big storm comes, big storm comes and everybody says,
[time=286] well who's fault is it, who's fault is it?
[time=288] And Jonah says, it's my fault.
[time=289] I'm running from God.
[time=291] He said go and I said no.
[time=293] And they said, I'm sorry but we're going to throw you off.
[time=296] Because Jonah said throw me off, it's my fault.
[time=299] And so they throw Jonah off into the ocean.
[time=304] And Jonah says, oh.
[time=305] - Oh.
[time=306] (audience laughing) - That's my favorite part.
[time=311] Okay, so you got it.
[time=313] God says go.
[time=315] Jonah says no.
[time=319] - Right.
[time=321] - And Jonah gets on a boat to go the opposite direction.
[time=323] Even farther and higher from God and there's a storm.
[time=326] And Jonah says, throw me off, it's my fault.
[time=328] And because Jonah, you remember this now, because Jonah said no to God, Jonah ends up saying, (audience laughing) I love that part, okay.
[time=340] So if you say no to God, you're going to sooner or later because you're disobedient, you're going to say.
[time=345] (audience laughing) I love that part.
[time=350] But what happens next?
[time=354] (audience laughing) God sends a big fish.
[time=361] And he calms to Jonah and he swallows him.
[time=367] And this is what he will do to you.
[time=371] If you have it, this will be God, a fish will swallow you.
[time=375] (audience laughing) No, that's not true.
[time=380] God only did that one time.
[time=381] So you don't have to worry.
[time=383] You don't have to worry if you disobeyed that God's going to send a fish to swallow you.
[time=386] But Jonah needed some time to think.
[time=388] And so God gave it to him.
[time=390] And does anybody know how long he had Jonah in the belly of the whale?
[time=394] Three days.
[time=396] Do you think it was cold and they're hot?
[time=400] Hot.
[time=401] It was hotter and there that isn't here right now, hundred and some degrees.
[time=405] Do you think we're other fish in there swimming around?
[time=408] Does anybody know what language that fish spoke?
[time=412] Well, talk.
[time=415] It's a (singing in foreign language) Okay, so Jonah's in there and all that's going on.
[time=426] And guess what Jonah finally tells God?
[time=428] (audience laughing) Jonah finally says, Jonah says it right after I ask for it.
[time=439] Jonah finally says, (audience laughing) So, what's God tell, see when we say sorry, because the radio transmitter inside of us is on the wrong channel, we're not listening to God.
[time=451] God says go, we say no, that's going to happen sometimes.
[time=454] But eventually we got to say sorry, we got to go the direction God told us to go, right?
[time=459] Might be walking across your classroom to help another friend, maybe it was mean to you the day before, but you're still going to be nice, right?
[time=465] So, God says, all right, fish, let's get rid of Jonah.
[time=470] (audience laughing) He said, let's get rid of Jonah, fish.
[time=478] And Jonah, once again, is tossed in the water and he says, (audience laughing) Oh, I love it.
[time=489] So, God tells Jonah, once again, to go.
[time=493] And so, he goes, and he goes to Nineveh and he speaks to people.
[time=498] It's so big, it has to be there three days.
[time=501] And he speaks to people, and he says, turn.
[time=506] You got to turn from your wicked ways.
[time=507] You got to go the other direction.
[time=510] It's the biggest message in all the Old Testament is turn.
[time=514] Turn back to God, people.
[time=519] Okay, so remember that?
[time=521] (audience chattering) Okay, they're not getting it, but the parents do.
[time=528] (audience laughing) The important thing is, remember, when God says go, we don't say, we say, yo, I'll go, say it again.
[time=537] Yo, I'll go, people in the stand say,
[time=543] (audience chattering) say that's right, but you know what happened?
[time=548] The people listened to the message.
[time=551] And they said, okay, we'll worship God.
[time=554] 120,000 people listened to the guy that the fish spit out, right?
[time=560] And Jonah, because those people were bad and he didn't think he was bad, he said he built himself a shelter in the shade under the tree and he's looking at the city and he's thinking God's gonna blow up the city.
[time=572] He's gonna send fire down, just, sorry about that.
[time=575] Go and send fire and get rid of the people.
[time=577] And Jonah's sitting there watching and God doesn't do it, oh, I love this picture.
[time=581] And God doesn't do it.
[time=582] And Jonah says, (audience chattering) what's Jonah saying?
[time=586] (audience chattering) I'm mad.
[time=589] Okay, Jonah's mad because he wanted the bad things to happen to the bad people, but Jonah forgot that he sometimes gets his radio transmitter on the wrong channel.
[time=600] And sometimes when God says go, Jonah says no, but we're supposed to say, yo, I'll go.
[time=609] And the parents say, yo, I'll go.
[time=612] No, the parents say it like they mean it.
[time=614] (audience chattering) Say that's great.
[time=617] And God provided a vine and then he gave Jonah's shade, he gave him mercy even though Jonah said no, but he finally said, yo, I'll go.
[time=625] And he still got the problem that Jonah doesn't like it when good things happen to people who are doing bad things.
[time=630] God's gonna use you, God's gonna use every one of you to go and help people who maybe have been bad to you sometimes, right?
[time=639] And he's gonna do that because somebody else spent three days somewhere, who is that?
[time=644] Jonah, but somebody else, Jesus.
[time=649] Jesus came as God's son, lived the perfect life, died on a cross, was in the tomb three days.
[time=654] And a rose in his spirit is available to you so that your transmitter can be on the right channel to hear God when God says go.
[time=662] You're not gonna say, say it louder.
[time=666] (audience chattering) But you'll instead say, (audience chattering) And parents, when you hear God say go, you're not gonna say no, you're gonna say.
[time=675] (audience chattering) Oh, that's great.
[time=679] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=753] [APPLAUSE]
[time=758] I didn't know you were going to get a workout this morning, did you?
[time=763] This next song has got some interesting motions that if you want to participate, go ahead, but they're over my head.
[time=769] I don't know how they go.
[time=771] [MUSIC]
[time=778] First we're going to sing "Nana." [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=929] [APPLAUSE]
[time=932] - We're in such a treat today.
[time=935] We have with us just a friend of God is how I would describe him.
[time=941] He's president of Cedarville University became president on June 1st, 2003 and he's here to speak to our graduates this evening.
[time=948] He earned his undergraduate degree at the University of South Florida and he holds a master of theology degree and a PhD from Dallas Theological Seminary.
[time=956] His wife Lynn is here with him today and he has two children, April and Alex.
[time=962] He has a genuine heart for God and intense love for university students as you'll see through his life at Cedarville.
[time=968] He has a strong commitment to assist Christians in developing their worldview, the eyes and the lenses through which they see all of life.
[time=976] He's written three books, Making Sense of Your Faith Where have all the dreamers gone, observations from a biblical worldview and making sense of your world.
[time=986] Additionally, Dr. Brown, who's with us today, has authored more than a hundred articles for journals, magazines, readers, digest, and Christianity today included.
[time=995] He's written for newspapers and encyclopedias.
[time=997] He's a regular columnist for the national magazine World.
[time=1000] His memberships include the Society of Christian Philosophers and the Evangelical Philosophical Society and the Evangelical Theological Society.
[time=1008] Would you please welcome a friend of Blackhawk, a friend of the Kingdom of God and a friend of God, Dr. Bill Brown.
[time=1017] (applause)
[time=1027] That was a great sermon, Mitch.
[time=1030] Did you illustrate that yourself?
[time=1032] That was really good.
[time=1037] (laughter) It's a joy to be with you on this special day.
[time=1046] You know anything about me?
[time=1048] You've been to Cedarville or places I spoke and I love PowerPoint.
[time=1052] I love having video examples and illustrations and none of that today.
[time=1060] I had put together, I thought, a pretty nifty presentation,
[time=1066] and the more I studied, the more I worked, the less appropriate it seemed.
[time=1070] It was almost like God was saying, "Don't do this. Do something else." And so that's what I'm going to do.
[time=1079] I want to talk about family.
[time=1082] And to be honest with you, it's very, very convicting for me.
[time=1087] And make it even more difficult.
[time=1090] My wife is here.
[time=1092] And those of you who speak, you know, you can talk all you want about marriage and family, unless the one you're married to or part of your family is there listening.
[time=1100] And my wife has been known to jump up and start laughing at times, and I don't want her to do that today.
[time=1107] We've been married 58 years.
[time=1111] Ouch.
[time=1116] What's that feel like?
[time=1117] Yeah, it was good.
[time=1118] Keep doing it.
[time=1121] I thought it was good.
[time=1125] We married 58 years, 29 for her, 29 for me.
[time=1128] And we actually celebrated our anniversary last Sunday.
[time=1135] And it was fun to do that.
[time=1140] You know what we did?
[time=1142] My wife gets on me because on our anniversary we always do odd things.
[time=1146] And last Sunday we went to a homeless shelter and fed the folks there with the family, which was fun to do.
[time=1153] But it's called "Home for the Heartless." I mean, "Heart for the Homeless." I did it again.
[time=1159] It's "Heart for the Homeless." I keep calling it a "Home for the Heartless." And they asked me not to come back anymore.
[time=1166] [laughter] Bart Starr, great quarterback.
[time=1174] Ring Bay Packers.
[time=1177] If you knew, turn, turn, turn, you knew Bart Starr.
[time=1184] And when his son, Bart Jr., would come home from elementary school and bring home one of those papers that we all love, put on the refrigerator.
[time=1194] And the great quarterback would say, "Oh, Bart, this is great." And he would post it so everybody could see it.
[time=1201] And he'd give little Bart a dime.
[time=1203] Real money back in those days.
[time=1208] The Green Bay Packers were great.
[time=1210] Bart Starr was incredible.
[time=1213] And one Sunday they played a game out on the west coast.
[time=1217] Back in those days, not every game was televised.
[time=1220] But this one was.
[time=1222] Playing the Rams when they were in L.A.
[time=1226] The Packers got clobbered and Starr played particularly poor.
[time=1232] Everybody in the nation saw it.
[time=1235] The long flight back from L.A.
[time=1238] and to Milwaukee, the drive up to Green Bay way after midnight, the house is dark.
[time=1244] Bart Starr walks into his room, his bedroom, and on his pillow there's a note.
[time=1249] "Dear Dad, I thought you played great.
[time=1253] I love you, Bart." And taped to the bottom of the note were two dimes.
[time=1264] A family is supposed to be a place where you're loved and accepted, where it's okay to blow it and make mistakes.
[time=1274] Because there are people around you who accept you for who you are.
[time=1280] And even when you mess up, they love you.
[time=1284] And they help you get back up.
[time=1289] And they help you dream dreams.
[time=1293] They help you see an incredible future because you are loved, respected, and accepted, and always forgiven.
[time=1304] God ordained three institutions in our society.
[time=1310] The government, the church, and the family.
[time=1315] Those three institutions, God intended to provide structure,
[time=1321] intended for it to be places where we learn to grow, where we struggle, where we develop, providing some structure to morally and behaviorally.
[time=1335] And it's not without notice that all three are being attacked,
[time=1341] particularly the family.
[time=1344] And I'll be honest with you.
[time=1346] I fight for the family because I think it's so important.
[time=1349] It's one of the reasons I do what I do at university.
[time=1353] Because the number of kids that come, Christian kids who come, who are so beaten up by their families in a Christian home,
[time=1365] is devastating.
[time=1369] So many girls need an older man to be a father to them
[time=1375] for the first time in their life.
[time=1380] To accept them for who they are and not how they look.
[time=1386] How many guys have no idea what it means to be a man?
[time=1392] Talking Christian kids.
[time=1394] In fact, tonight, the graduation.
[time=1397] I want to point out that over half of the kids who are professing Christians when they're 18, by the time they graduate from college, state universities, they no longer walk with Christ.
[time=1407] We're losing an entire generation.
[time=1409] It doesn't matter whether they went to a Christian school or not, or to a good church.
[time=1418] The family, to me, is the core of all that God has for us as believers.
[time=1424] When we look at culture around us and the family's being attacked, both marriage and the family, we can say, "Oh, we've got to pass laws.
[time=1430] We've got to let the right people." And you know what?
[time=1433] It's time for us to be the right people.
[time=1436] If our marriages and families were what they should be, then it wouldn't matter what the laws were.
[time=1442] And, you know, non-Christian people act often non-Christianly.
[time=1446] They're going to look at life that way.
[time=1452] But God has called us to be men and women of God to highlight the family,
[time=1458] to make it a place that honors him.
[time=1462] Because when God chooses an institution to illustrate and to be a picture for his love and relationship to us, he chooses family.
[time=1473] He chooses a family.
[time=1480] Turn to the book of Ephesians, well-known passage.
[time=1483] There's so much here.
[time=1484] I'm just going to have to skim across the top.
[time=1490] And what I want to do in sharing my thoughts with you this morning is follow the apostles' pattern here in the book of Ephesians.
[time=1503] I know this church, Kelly, Mitch, all of you who serve here,
[time=1510] love the Word of God and the God of the Word.
[time=1514] And you dig into the Word of God.
[time=1518] So I'm not sure there's much more I can share with you that you haven't already heard.
[time=1521] That's why what I want to do is to give you a picture, to give you some insight, and some challenges along the way.
[time=1529] The book of Ephesians was intended to be a circular letter, a letter that went to a large group of people over a broad area.
[time=1538] The first three chapters, as you know, are heavy doctrine.
[time=1542] I mean, you have to swim deep and swim hard just to begin, to plumb the depths of what is happening doctrineally.
[time=1551] And then, like most of Paul's letters, you get to about halfway, to three-fourths of the way through the book.
[time=1557] And he says, "therefore," and then he gives you all the practical applications to that.
[time=1565] And that happens in chapter four.
[time=1567] And then as practical applications are, here's all these truths about God.
[time=1571] Now, put him into practice these five ways.
[time=1574] He says, "walk this way, walk this way, walk this way, walk this way." If you have the NIV, it's, "live this way, live this way, live this way."
[time=1586] And then he gets to chapter five, and he highlights there three different ways of walking.
[time=1597] The first two leading up to that, "walk worthy of your calling," he says in chapter four verse one.
[time=1602] And then later on, he says, "don't walk as the Gentiles did in the futility of their mind, walk in a new way.
[time=1607] As Christians, our lives should show something new.
[time=1610] There should be something different." But then he jumps into chapter five, and he's got three or four ways.
[time=1616] You are to walk in love, walk in light, and then to walk in wisdom wisely.
[time=1626] These are the five ways of putting into practice what he said in the first three chapters.
[time=1631] Now, when he says, "walk wisely," it's interesting how he segues into,
[time=1638] "Therefore be submissive to each other." He says that in verse 21 of chapter five, "be submissive to each other." Does that go counter-cultural?
[time=1651] Be submissive to each other is going upstream with everything that's happening in the culture today,
[time=1658] where it's all about you, it's all about what you want, it's all about being yourself, having faith in yourself.
[time=1667] In fact, on the way over here this morning, my wife was reading the paper and on the front of Parade magazine, you saw Mariah Carey, and there's something she had to restore her faith to, to find her faith again.
[time=1678] And my first question to Lynn was, "faith in what?" Pretty obvious, faith in herself.
[time=1686] That's the faith of the American culture, isn't it?
[time=1690] Faith in yourself.
[time=1692] Submit to one another.
[time=1694] And then he takes this huge turn and flaps us right in the face with verses 22 all the way through the beginning of chapter six and says, "Let me show you how we can work that out." And he starts talking about the family because this is where it starts.
[time=1709] This is where it starts.
[time=1713] Wives, he says, in verse 22.
[time=1716] Husbands, verse 25, the section of the husband is a little too long for me.
[time=1723] The children, chapter six, verse one, and then fathers in chapter four.
[time=1730] Wives, husbands, children.
[time=1734] He gives you a perspective and a challenge.
[time=1737] And so I just want to talk about what he's talking about here.
[time=1742] Notice how he starts with marriage.
[time=1747] Husband and wife, talking about the family, it starts with the marriage.
[time=1750] And if you've flown recently, some of you fly a lot, okay, you're sitting there and before the plane even takes off, you've got the stewardess or the steward up front telling you what to do, where the exits are, you know, and how you're supposed to get in and out.
[time=1766] And then they make this comment, "By the way, if we lose all the air in the cabin, if it somehow gets sucked out, don't despair because we have extra."
[time=1777] Okay, and these things will fall down these masks.
[time=1780] And what are you supposed to do if you have children?
[time=1784] You put them on yourself first before the children.
[time=1790] It seems to be what Paul is getting at here.
[time=1793] Your family starts with mom and dad, the marriage.
[time=1802] Take care of breathing the air of the Holy Spirit of God in your relationship.
[time=1808] Then that becomes the means by which you share it with them as well.
[time=1815] Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
[time=1820] For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body of which he is a savior.
[time=1827] Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands and everything.
[time=1833] Hard words in today's culture as well.
[time=1837] If you remember my big fat Greek wedding.
[time=1843] Maria Portacalla is talking to Tula.
[time=1846] Ah, she says the husband is the head of the family.
[time=1850] But the wife is the neck and she turns the head wherever she wants.
[time=1858] I find it fascinating if the Apostle Paul starts with the wives.
[time=1864] And the idea of submission, of course, is not that there's something that is inherently inferior about being a wife or being a woman.
[time=1872] It's obvious that if you weren't equal, you wouldn't need to submit.
[time=1878] The key is, of course, from the biblical perspective that the husband is responsible.
[time=1886] He is the one that God holds accountable for the marriage and the family.
[time=1893] Doesn't mean he's better or stronger or for sure smarter, just responsible.
[time=1906] And God is asking you sweet ladies to recognize that.
[time=1913] See, in the other day, there was a fellow in Berlin.
[time=1917] Okay, in Berlin.
[time=1918] He has a unique way of cowering his wife into submission.
[time=1922] He says she just goes on and on and on all the time talking.
[time=1925] I can't get a word in Edgewise.
[time=1927] So he bought a World War II air siring.
[time=1931] The kind that would warn the whole city of an air raid.
[time=1936] And he said when she starts going on, he can't get a word in Edgewise, he cranks that thing up.
[time=1941] He said it's amazing, just a few minutes of that, and it's just total peace and quiet.
[time=1946] The problem is the neighbors complained and they came and took it away.
[time=1952] Don't do that.
[time=1955] Submission is not something that a husband imposes on his wife.
[time=1958] It's something that a wife recognizes that her husband is indeed the one responsible.
[time=1969] Tough words sometimes.
[time=1973] First Peter chapter three and Titus chapter two remind the wives that they have a responsibility
[time=1980] that goes beyond just their own relationship.
[time=1982] In fact, Titus chapter two says okay, you older wives, you should teach the younger women to love their husbands.
[time=1992] And teaching them doesn't mean to tell them, it means to show them.
[time=1997] Let me remind you of something that we all know that love indeed is a byproduct of a commitment.
[time=2005] When God wrote through the Apostle Paul and Peter all of the commands which relate to family and marriage.
[time=2013] You've got to remember that at those times you did not choose your mate.
[time=2021] Your mate was chosen for you many times before you were even born.
[time=2028] Usually by the age of twelve there was a patrol period that may have lasted five or six years.
[time=2034] In fact that was the relationship of Mary and Joseph.
[time=2038] You didn't choose this person yet.
[time=2040] God says okay, wives you need to be submissive to him.
[time=2043] You didn't choose him.
[time=2045] Later on he's going to say husbands love your wives.
[time=2047] You didn't choose her.
[time=2049] But love is the outgrowth of a commitment.
[time=2053] A marriage that is based on romantic love does not last very long.
[time=2060] But a marriage that is based on a commitment to the person lasts forever.
[time=2065] That's the point that he's making here.
[time=2069] Husbands get a terrible, terrible perspective and treatment by today's entertainment culture.
[time=2074] Tell me one good perspective, character on television today of a husband and a father.
[time=2081] They're just not there.
[time=2083] Just not there.
[time=2085] And most of us live up to or down to that pretty readily.
[time=2091] So the challenge for the wives, not going to be careful here because I'm not one.
[time=2097] But my wife is.
[time=2099] And one thing about my wife is that she is my biggest fan.
[time=2104] She laughs at my jokes, both of them.
[time=2110] And she really believes I can do anything.
[time=2112] Even after 29 years, she really believes I can do anything.
[time=2115] And you know what guys, that keeps me going a lot.
[time=2118] I remember reading the other day about a fellow named Nathaniel who was working in a custom house.
[time=2128] His wife Sophia was a dear woman.
[time=2132] But he came home one day, had lost his job, and he was in tears.
[time=2137] Could not care for his family.
[time=2139] And she brightened her face and said, "Oh, have I got something for you?
[time=2144] Now is your opportunity to write.
[time=2146] You're such a genius.
[time=2147] You're so gifted.
[time=2148] Now is your opportunity to write the novel you wanted to write?" He says, "Great.
[time=2152] How are we going to make ends meet?" And she went and pulled out a stash of money that she had been saving for over five years, from the money that he had been giving her to buy food.
[time=2164] So I've been saving this for this time.
[time=2168] There's enough here for a year.
[time=2171] So Nathaniel Hawthorne went on and wrote the Scarlet Letter that year.
[time=2177] While he caused his wife believed that he encouraged and made provision for him to excel.
[time=2186] My wife is a lot like that.
[time=2192] The apostle goes on and jumps right into husbands.
[time=2196] Now this is probably what devastated me when I was preparing.
[time=2201] "Love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[time=2208] Verse 26, "Why to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word?
[time=2214] And to present her to himself as a radiant church without stain or wrinkle or any other
[time=2220] blemish but holy and blameless.
[time=2222] In this same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.
[time=2225] He who loves his wife loves himself.
[time=2227] After all no one ever hated his own body but he feeds and cares for it just as Christ does the church.
[time=2233] For we are members of his body.
[time=2236] For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh.
[time=2243] This is a profound mystery but I'm talking about Christ and the church.
[time=2247] However each of you must love his wife as he loves himself and the wife must respect her husband.
[time=2256] The reason this was so devastating to me is simply this.
[time=2260] Husbands love your wives.
[time=2263] Okay it's good.
[time=2266] As Christ loved the church.
[time=2271] Ouch.
[time=2276] Men have you ever let that sink in to your heart?
[time=2281] Do you realize how unlovable the church is?
[time=2289] Husbands love your wife as Christ loved the church.
[time=2295] But then it doesn't stop there and gave himself up for her.
[time=2304] Oh man I was absolutely devastated.
[time=2311] Because I have a lot of friends and so have you who have left their wives because they
[time=2317] weren't making them happy anymore or they'd outgrown them or she's changed or whatever.
[time=2328] Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church.
[time=2335] It doesn't matter what your wife does or is.
[time=2340] Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[time=2350] Imagine what an incredible testimony this would be to an unsaved world.
[time=2356] If we guys got our act together and really loved our wives as Christ loved the church
[time=2366] and gave ourselves up for her.
[time=2376] Men and women are different.
[time=2379] No secret.
[time=2381] This culture says oh you're the same maybe just a little chromosome here that basically you're the same not.
[time=2391] It's evident everywhere.
[time=2393] Your wife watches HGTV, TLC, Discovery Channel, UWatch, ESPN and so on.
[time=2402] You say to a woman oh that's a nice shirt she'll tell you oh I got this for seven dollars an old navy, you say it to a guy who'll say thanks.
[time=2413] If you press the word you get it out of the hamper I pull it out smell the armpits okay
[time=2419] and it's good to go.
[time=2422] We're different.
[time=2425] And that's why the Apostle writes 1 Peter chapter 3 verse 7 live with your wives in an
[time=2433] understanding way.
[time=2437] Guys it's not about us.
[time=2443] We try to solve everything as well.
[time=2446] I'm horrible.
[time=2447] When my wife tells me something I tried to give her five ways of solving it.
[time=2451] That's not what she needs to hear.
[time=2454] I was with a few guys.
[time=2455] One guy was a CEO of this major oil company.
[time=2457] You probably know the name.
[time=2459] You would know the name of the company maybe the name of the guy.
[time=2461] He's in semi-retirement they're down in Florida for half the year.
[time=2464] He said he walked in to this new home and he opened up the refrigerator and said it was a mess.
[time=2469] He said it's been two hours and I reorganized the refrigerator for my wife.
[time=2475] He said I went upstairs and I heard her come in from the grocery store and then I heard her stomp up the stairs and she said you may be president of the world but you stay out of my kitchen.
[time=2488] Get with your wives in an understanding way.
[time=2492] Husbands love your wives.
[time=2495] It's Christ love the church.
[time=2503] The council challenged a couple that were birds of divorce.
[time=2507] Husband I want you to show your wife every day ten different ways that you love her.
[time=2517] No month their relationship was revolutionized.
[time=2522] Not only from her perspective but from his.
[time=2527] Times during the day does Christ show you that he loves you.
[time=2533] Husbands love your wives.
[time=2536] Christ loves the church.
[time=2539] Now husband if you decide to do this be prepared for your wives not to believe you or to trust
[time=2548] you.
[time=2549] A fellow wrote the other day that he had heard this from somebody and said this seems to
[time=2555] work so he came home from the work one day and said honey you look great I love you.
[time=2560] He took her up in his arms and kissed her and everything and she just burst into tears.
[time=2565] And he said what did I do and she said what a day Billy got in a fight at school the
[time=2571] refrigerator quit and the groceries are spoiled and you come home drunk.
[time=2580] So give her some warning you know that this might be a transformation of your life.
[time=2588] It's the little things that are the most important guys not just the big things.
[time=2593] G.K. Chesterton talks about the infinite power of small things.
[time=2601] No matter how she responds or how she lives.
[time=2604] Husbands love your wives as Christ love the church.
[time=2611] Brian Chappell you know president of the covenant seminary talks about a friend of theirs who has a beautiful house kids good jobs and so on but his wife has an emotional problem a mental problem she periodically steals money from him from other members of the family and gambles loses it all.
[time=2631] It has caused him to lose a number of jobs lose friends.
[time=2638] Every time she's done this and she seems to be getting worse and actually ruin his own
[time=2644] future he forgives her takes her back even when she tried to take her own life.
[time=2651] He was there with her nursed her through that brought her home.
[time=2655] Brian said have you ever thought about just maybe ending this marriage.
[time=2662] He said my family and friends tell me all the time that I should leave.
[time=2666] But he goes on she's a good mother most of the time and my children need her.
[time=2671] But more than that they need to know the love of their God how can they know of a father in heaven who forgives them if their own father won't forgive their own mother.
[time=2682] Husbands love your wives.
[time=2687] Every man in this room if we get that under our skin we can transform a culture because
[time=2696] God uses the family as a picture.
[time=2700] So I want to jump very quickly into the fathers I know it's at the end of the passage here but guys we as fathers we do not know the impact we have on our kids.
[time=2711] We are God for many of them in the early years.
[time=2716] In fact over 250 times in the Bible in the New Testament God is called what?
[time=2724] Father, Father.
[time=2729] A recent survey said what are the three top things that fathers say to their children?
[time=2736] This is in a magazine.
[time=2739] Number one is I'm too tired.
[time=2742] Number two we don't have enough money.
[time=2746] Number three shut up.
[time=2751] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 4 if you can put your eyes fall down there.
[time=2755] Fathers do not exasperate your children.
[time=2760] Instead bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
[time=2765] Whatever that is it's not exasperated.
[time=2767] We exaggerate them by what we say and what we don't say.
[time=2774] I read just the other day about Robert Schuller.
[time=2777] He was all over the world and speaking and so on and he said that at his church it had this raffled us fund raving raffle and the person who promised the most money got to have lunch with him.
[time=2788] The person played $500.
[time=2791] He was very excited and showed up and found out it was his own daughter.
[time=2796] That was her savings account.
[time=2799] She wanted to spend time with her dad.
[time=2804] I open her isn't it?
[time=2807] Isn't it interesting too in Luke chapter 15?
[time=2811] The parable we call the prodigal son it's really the faithful father.
[time=2816] That passage is incredible.
[time=2819] The father, the father who loves his son both sons both of them rebellious in their own way.
[time=2826] He never gives up.
[time=2828] And when that prodigal son in the far country is just in the depths of sin, who does he think of?
[time=2835] Dad, my dad.
[time=2840] I'll go back and I'll be a servant.
[time=2843] I'll be a slave for the rest of my life.
[time=2845] And when he comes back his dad takes them back not as a slave but as a son.
[time=2855] Our kids gentlemen are overwhelmed by culture.
[time=2860] And these young girls I was looking at the little ones up here and in many ways my heart grieved by what they're going to have to go through.
[time=2868] They're going to be taught that the most important thing in life is how you look.
[time=2876] They're going to be taught that the most exciting experience in life is sex, the physical side, that's it.
[time=2887] And they need to learn love from us guys gentlemen so that they can see what true love is from a father so they won't take the imitation from somebody else.
[time=2899] Instead of developing on the outside for them to develop the character, the virtue, the skill, the knowledge, the academic ability that's going to make them effective in the world today.
[time=2911] And gentlemen we are responsible.
[time=2915] I started years ago when my daughter was just six months old.
[time=2919] She's 20, almost 21 now.
[time=2921] Taking her to breakfast every Saturday morning, six months old not much conversation.
[time=2928] Every Saturday morning we go to breakfast together and talk.
[time=2932] And April said to me last night, she said, "You know dad, we just had one conversation our whole life.
[time=2941] Been the biggest blessing of my life.
[time=2943] Is that one conversation that we've had that's still ongoing.
[time=2947] And only a dad, only a dad can do that.
[time=2951] But don't forget moms, man I tell you, without moms, where would we be?
[time=2957] When you're sick you want your mom.
[time=2960] There are three types of moms, you've heard this.
[time=2964] You got your 13 month old sitting on the kitchen floor, bag of Oreos on the floor, one bite out of each of the Oreos.
[time=2971] Mom walks in, the first mom will go and get the paddle, second mom will go and get the broom, third mom will go and get a camera.
[time=2980] Which mom are you?
[time=2985] Frederick Douglas, great-great African-American leader when he was a slave in Maryland.
[time=2994] His mother, when he's very small, his mother was taken to a plantation 12 miles away.
[time=3003] She would get up after everybody went to bed and walk the 12 miles to where he was.
[time=3010] Little boy.
[time=3013] She would cuddle him and talk with him and get him to sleep, fall asleep with him.
[time=3020] And then she'd walk 12 miles back.
[time=3025] She did that as he grew up.
[time=3027] There's no wonder he became the man he became.
[time=3031] Only a mom can do that.
[time=3034] Lynn and I were privileged to know a lady named Katherine Hickman.
[time=3038] Her son was born with a terrible disease, polio.
[time=3044] And he told that he would never ever be able to get around or walk and he would have some brain deficiencies
[time=3050] and that Ed would never ever amount to anything.
[time=3052] Well, Katherine took it upon herself to take him to school every single day.
[time=3058] Push him in his wheelchair, sit beside him, take notes for him.
[time=3063] She would get him up every day.
[time=3064] Katherine was only about this tall and probably weighed about 100 pounds.
[time=3068] But she would pick him up every day and clothe him and wash him and clothe him so that when he weighed 230 pounds
[time=3074] she could still do it because she lifted him every single day of his life and graduated from high school.
[time=3080] I loved his mom.
[time=3082] She got sick.
[time=3083] She had not gotten sick in 20 years.
[time=3085] Had to go to the hospital and she wept when I went to see her.
[time=3088] And I said, "What's wrong, Katherine?" And she said, "I won't be able to pick him up anymore." Sure enough, two weeks later she died.
[time=3099] There's a lady who invested her life in her son and served as a role model for love and sacrifice.
[time=3108] It's still with us today.
[time=3112] And kids, how many of you have a mother or father?
[time=3115] Okay, that's most of us here.
[time=3119] All of us are kids.
[time=3120] You never stop being a child, do you?
[time=3123] My dad just passed away a few months ago and I miss him so much, but he still is with me.
[time=3131] Most of you know what I'm talking about.
[time=3133] Children, obey your parents and the Lord for this is right.
[time=3139] Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise.
[time=3144] That it may go well with you and that you may enjoy a long life on the earth.
[time=3151] As a parent, you know what we want from you kids more than anything else?
[time=3156] Just two things.
[time=3158] Your love and your respect.
[time=3163] We need to know that you love us.
[time=3165] Please tell us.
[time=3171] And we need to respect as well.
[time=3173] That's the honor.
[time=3174] That's from God.
[time=3178] If you haven't told your mom or your dad that you love them and I don't care if they're 90 years old, do so.
[time=3186] You reap what you sow.
[time=3190] Bill Gates, when he delivered a commencement address, gave 11 rules of life and this is rule 7.
[time=3196] This is to the graduates, he said.
[time=3198] Before you were born, your parents were not as boring as they are now.
[time=3202] They got that way by paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are.
[time=3212] Proverbs 10, "A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son grief to his mother."
[time=3229] Then Proverbs 29, "The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself discraces his mother."
[time=3240] Whatever you may have suffered or struggled or been deprived of by mom and dad, whether you're 14 or whether you are 84,
[time=3251] there's nothing that you could do about that.
[time=3256] But what you become is your responsibility.
[time=3262] Let me encourage you in that.
[time=3269] Family reveals our character, particularly marriage.
[time=3275] If there's anything that a family should have, it is to be bathed in grace.
[time=3281] A place of acceptance, a place of love.
[time=3285] I grew up in a Roman Catholic family, a great family, but pretty legalistic as well.
[time=3293] I was loved if I did the right things, I was ignored if I didn't.
[time=3298] And that was my view of God, until I came to Christ just before I went to university.
[time=3305] And I remember I didn't want my children to grow up that way.
[time=3309] And so I'd always tell my daughter April when she was very small.
[time=3312] I said, "April, I love you even when you're bad, sometimes especially when you're bad.
[time=3317] I love you." And she would crawl up in my lap and I'd say, "April, I love you." And she'd say, "Yeah, I know even when I'm bad." You know your father, your Heavenly Father loves you even when you're bad.
[time=3332] He does.
[time=3334] That's the idea of God's grace.
[time=3338] We accept it in our lives as Christians, we need to have a family that is grace-based as well.
[time=3348] Life is too serious not to have fun and to enjoy each other in family.
[time=3357] Your children will become what they are encouraged to become.
[time=3362] I was in South Texas in prison visiting, visiting.
[time=3368] And actually I was on a ministry team with Bill Glass.
[time=3371] Many of you know Bill Glass from Cleveland Browns.
[time=3373] And we were in a gym with 2,000 inmates.
[time=3377] And Bill just made this statement.
[time=3379] He said, "I bet a bunch of you had a mom or a dad." He said, "One day you're going to end up in prison." How many of you had a mom or dad that said that?
[time=3386] Over 90% of them raised their hand.
[time=3390] What do we say to our kids sometimes that they become the prophecy in their life?
[time=3397] On the other hand, take the story of Benjamin West.
[time=3399] One of the greatest painters we share with England.
[time=3402] And he tells the story of being a young child.
[time=3404] And mom was gone, his sister called her Susie, I forget her name.
[time=3408] He sat her down on a table and got out some paper and some paints and was going to paint a picture of Susie.
[time=3414] He painted and painted and got paint everywhere.
[time=3419] All over the paper, all over the table, the floor, Susie, it's everywhere.
[time=3424] He said, "My mother walked in and saw that mess." She strode over to me, she bent down and she kissed me on my forehead.
[time=3435] Looking at my picture and said, "That's a beautiful painting."
[time=3441] Years later, Benjamin West said, "That kiss made me a painter."
[time=3450] What are we doing?
[time=3453] Isn't it time that we as Christians say to God, "Okay, you're right about the family."
[time=3459] And we don't care what culture is doing.
[time=3461] "Oh, yes, we care, but it doesn't matter.
[time=3463] This is what we're going to do." And it starts right here, guys.
[time=3468] I think we're the key.
[time=3470] Every man in this room, we're the key.
[time=3474] Let's be the fathers that we're called to be.
[time=3482] To love our wives, Christ loved the church, gave himself up for her.
[time=3489] And to look at our kids and say, "What a precious heritage we have for His glory, not ours."
[time=3497] Let's pray, Father.
[time=3501] We are overwhelmed by your love for us, your acceptance of us.
[time=3507] And I pray that you will allow us to be men and women of God.
[time=3512] I pray for each of us here, particularly at each of us men,
[time=3519] that we will take the heart, the challenge that you've given us from your Word.
[time=3525] And maybe we need help from each other to do this, but whatever it is, Lord, let this church be a beachhead for the reclamation of the family
[time=3535] as it's intended to be lived and loved for your glory.
[time=3539] Thank you for the grace that comes to us only through Jesus Christ.
[time=3543] You accept us not because of what we've done, but because of what you've done.
[time=3548] We thank you, Father.
[time=3552] Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=3582] [SILENCE]
