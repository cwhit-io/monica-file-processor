[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=60] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=85] And I am so looking forward to an opportunity that we'll have here at Black Hawk this coming summer, August 11th through the 13th.
[time=94] We will have the privilege once again of hosting and being a satellite location for what has become known as the Leadership Summit.
[time=104] The 2005 Leadership Summit has been hosted for years now.
[time=108] Ten years actually, this has been going on.
[time=111] The Leadership Summit is something that began originally at Willow Creek Community Church in North Barrington, Illinois.
[time=119] Over the last ten years, the attendance at the Leadership Summit Conference has grown.
[time=125] What began with a couple of thousand has now grown into the home campus there at
[time=132] Willow Creek along with over 90 satellite locations all over the country.
[time=139] We're anticipating over 50,000 people will be in attendance at Willow here at
[time=146] Black Hawk and at these other satellite locations.
[time=149] And the whole purpose of the summit is to challenge and encourage and equip leaders, leaders in the church, leaders in the marketplace, leaders in homes, leaders in organizations.
[time=161] Leadership is something.
[time=163] It is an amazing gift.
[time=165] It is the opportunity that God gives us to challenge and encourage and motivate others.
[time=172] Leaders have the privilege of casting a vision.
[time=175] Leaders have the opportunity of building teams.
[time=178] And they may be big teams or they may be small teams.
[time=180] But every leader needs an opportunity to kind of get refueled.
[time=185] And the Leadership Summit is a great, great opportunity for you.
[time=189] Would you watch this video?
[time=190] I'm going to have the guys run it here.
[time=192] Watch the video and just get a taste.
[time=194] Kind of get a feel for what's coming.
[time=196] The Leadership Summit August 11th through 13th right here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=205] The Summit's engaging.
[time=209] There's a lot to be offered here.
[time=210] We're coming every year.
[time=211] The worship is incredible.
[time=213] You need to invest in this.
[time=214] I think it just teaches you to be a better leader in every area of your own life.
[time=218] The skills and the techniques and the points that are being given here apply across the board.
[time=224] The Leadership Summit for us is inspiring.
[time=227] Sometimes all God leads you with is a plank.
[time=236] But a plank is enough to get you back to shore where you can stand up on dry land
[time=243] and walk into your destiny.
[time=245] You and I have never been hooked with average anything.
[time=247] People don't pay for average.
[time=249] The number one thing that people want in leaders is integrity.
[time=255] We deal in a state in business, performance on demand, get it done, but yet we've got all this baggage that's coming along.
[time=262] Will you commit the rest of your life to doing the five things God put you on earth to do?
[time=269] These are not optional friends.
[time=271] They are your reason for existence.
[time=273] Revealing churches from what I can see from God's Word and by travels throughout the world tend to manifest themselves as Romans 12 8 spiritually gifted leaders or groups of leaders who finally start doing what God called and gifted them to do in the first place.
[time=288] They lead.
[time=290] And I believe that more strongly today than at any other time in my life, friends, it's a lot about leadership.
[time=298] So if you had to give, lead and lead with all diligence.
[time=317] Well, as you can see, it is going to be a phenomenal conference and God has used the
[time=326] leadership summit in the lives of thousands and thousands of leaders all across the world.
[time=331] We really hope you'll come and be a part.
[time=333] Here's how you can do it.
[time=335] Go to our website at blackhockministries.org.
[time=338] And when you go to blackhockministries.org, you'll notice down at the bottom of all of our links, there's a special leadership summit link.
[time=345] You can click on there and all of your questions can be answered, your registration process
[time=351] can take place.
[time=352] We really, really want to encourage you to come.
[time=355] And not only yourself, but bring some other leaders, bring some emerging leaders from your organization, bring some seasoned leaders who may need to be kind of refreshed, but come
[time=365] and be a part of this leadership experience.
[time=368] We hope to see you there.
[time=370] Thanks so much for being a part of what God's doing here at Blackhock.
[time=373] And in Deuteronomy, let's read together, he is the rock, his works are perfect and all
[time=381] his ways are just, a faithful guy who does no wrong, upright and just is he.
[time=389] Let's stay together and sing to the rock of our salvation.
[time=411] God is filled on nothing less than Jesus' love and righteousness.
[time=425] I dare not trust the sweetest brain, but hold it lean on Jesus' name.
[time=437] All the Christ is silent, I can stand, and all other ground is sinking sand.
[time=461] God is seen, it's too high in space, I rest on his unchanging grace.
[time=470] In every high and stormy gale, my anchor walls within the bed.
[time=482] All the Christ is silent, I can stand, and all other ground is sinking sand.
[time=505] I'm the soul of his blood, the lament his blood, support me in your only blood.
[time=514] When all the ground, I soak his flame, leaving his own, I hope it stays.
[time=526] All the Christ is silent, I can stand, and all other ground is sinking sand.
[time=550] He shall call with a pit sound, oh may I then, it can be found.
[time=558] Rest in his righteousness alone, for let's just stand before the throne.
[time=567] For let's just stand before the throne, for let's just stand before the throne.
[time=580] All the Christ is silent, I can stand, and all other ground is sinking sand.
[time=606] All the other ground is sinking sand.
[time=627] Why, do we do the things we do, how can we sing?
[time=636] When there's no reason to, how do we smile?
[time=643] When there's not much to smile about, when the world is down?
[time=650] So are we to stand and shout, and they wonder why we do the things we do.
[time=661] It's all because of this, it's all because of this.
[time=691] They wonder why we do the things we do.
[time=708] You walked in today, and each one of us has fears, but what is your greatest fear?
[time=716] What causes you the most anxiety about the future?
[time=719] Go ahead and tell the person next to you, go.
[time=722] Greatest fear.
[time=732] Laughing.
[time=735] Catherine, did Keith tell you anything you didn't know?
[time=739] Okay, I just curious, if after 50, 52, 56 years of marriage, holy moly.
[time=749] Happy Father's Day.
[time=751] Can we say thank you to Keith and Catherine Moore, 56 years of wealth.
[time=757] Kelly, what's your greatest fear?
[time=759] My greatest fear.
[time=762] We're having fun, or are we being serious?
[time=764] You can be either one.
[time=765] Gosh, my greatest fear.
[time=767] I kind of like the fun.
[time=769] Poison oak.
[time=770] I'm absolutely terrified of poison.
[time=773] I don't know if poison oak does anything to you.
[time=775] What it does to me is just unspeakable.
[time=777] Are you serious?
[time=778] I'm serious.
[time=779] I've never seen you happen.
[time=780] Ignorant about it.
[time=781] That's the problem.
[time=782] I'll be walking in the woods with the kids and all of a sudden just stop and go, "Wait a minute.
[time=787] Where am I?" What's it look like?
[time=789] I don't know.
[time=790] That's the problem.
[time=793] No, I know what it looks like.
[time=798] How about you?
[time=799] Fear of being misunderstood in a way that it would hurt someone's feelings.
[time=804] That's good.
[time=805] I talk about poison oak and you go serious on me.
[time=807] That's great.
[time=808] No, I mean really.
[time=809] I know.
[time=810] I'm really afraid of being misunderstood.
[time=813] Really?
[time=814] You understand what I'm saying?
[time=815] I understand what you're saying.
[time=818] I got you.
[time=819] You're clear.
[time=820] Well, in a study a few years ago, the number one fear.
[time=825] Anyone want a guess?
[time=827] Fear of public speaking.
[time=829] What was number two?
[time=831] Death.
[time=833] People would rather be the person in the casket than the person given the eulogy is what one comedian said.
[time=841] Fear is interesting.
[time=844] Fear and anxiety about the future.
[time=847] Well, what about the fear of evangelism?
[time=849] Somebody's just the word alone.
[time=852] You can send shivers up and down your spine.
[time=854] You know, fear of communicating Christ to another person.
[time=858] Oh, my word.
[time=859] You've got to be kidding me.
[time=860] And I think that there are four things I want you to write down.
[time=866] Four fears that we have on why we don't.
[time=869] And these are linked to the points in the message.
[time=871] So I want you to write these down and write them down in order.
[time=874] Number one is fear that I'm not worthy.
[time=877] A whole no man.
[time=879] Fear that I'm not worthy.
[time=880] Not me.
[time=882] I'm not going to communicate Christ to anybody.
[time=884] My life's a mess.
[time=886] In case you didn't know, I'm a sinner.
[time=888] You know, these are things that go through our mind.
[time=890] I don't have it all together.
[time=891] I don't have enough to gather enough to go tell somebody about Christ.
[time=893] So number one is fear that I'm not worthy.
[time=895] Number two, fear why I don't evangelize is the fear that I won't have all the answers.
[time=903] Write that down.
[time=904] The fear that I won't have all the answers.
[time=906] You can all relate to that, right?
[time=908] Somebody's going to ask some question, but I don't know the answer to.
[time=911] Number three, fear of the conflict.
[time=917] Fear of the conflict.
[time=918] And why would I want to take time for that?
[time=920] I don't have the time anyway.
[time=921] So why would I take time to go be part of some conflict?
[time=926] So fear of the conflict or the tension it might stir up.
[time=929] And then number four, the fear that I'm not going to convince anybody of anything anyway.
[time=935] So number one, the fear that I'm not worthy.
[time=938] I don't have my life together.
[time=939] Number two, the fear that I won't have all the answers.
[time=943] And number three, the fear that I'll create conflict and who's got time for that.
[time=949] And number four, the fear that I can't convince them.
[time=953] And it's no wonder that the most frequently repeated command in all of scripture is fear not.
[time=960] Fear not.
[time=967] Fear not, Isaac.
[time=970] Fear not, Jacob.
[time=972] Fear not, Moses.
[time=974] Fear not, Joshua.
[time=977] For I, the Lord, God, am with you.
[time=981] In essence, throughout scripture, God tells us to move from fear to faith.
[time=989] And when it comes to communicating who God is, communicating a life with Christ, we need to move from fear to faith.
[time=1001] We come to this passage here today, 1 Peter chapter 3.
[time=1005] 1 Peter chapter 3 verses 13 through 17 in an honor of God's word.
[time=1012] Would you stand and allow me to read this?
[time=1018] It says in 1 Peter 3, 13, it says, "Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?
[time=1028] But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed.
[time=1033] And do not fear their intimidation and do not be troubled, but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts,
[time=1039] always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you,
[time=1047] that with gentleness and reverence, and keep verse 16 and keep a good conscience,
[time=1053] so that in the thing in which you are slander, those who revile your good behavior in Christ
[time=1059] will be put to shame, for it is better if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong."
[time=1070] Would you pray with me?
[time=1072] Father, God, as we come before you this morning, we would admit as a people that there are times when we are frightened.
[time=1079] God, there are times when the uncertainty of it all.
[time=1083] God, there are times when the difficulty of the challenge or the circumstance that we face can move us away
[time=1090] from that which we know to be true and right.
[time=1092] God, our prayer today is that you would teach us.
[time=1095] Show us what we need to see.
[time=1097] God, remind us of truth.
[time=1098] Maybe we've forgotten or show us new truth that could alter and change not only the way we think,
[time=1104] but how we live.
[time=1106] God allow us to be a people of faith, a faith that stabilizes us.
[time=1111] God of faith that anchors us.
[time=1113] God of faith that can stand in the midst of whatever fear we might face and be the people you've called us to be.
[time=1120] God, do this today in us and we'll thank you for it.
[time=1123] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1126] You can be seated.
[time=1129] I think it's important as we start out to kind of look at the context.
[time=1133] And I'm going to ask Mitch to just kind of run you real quick through.
[time=1136] You've got to really listen.
[time=1138] You've got to look at where we've been.
[time=1140] This passage is a phenomenal passage.
[time=1143] This passage gains even more punch and clarity when you see it in light of where we've been.
[time=1149] Mitch is going to just take you real quick back through our journey so far.
[time=1153] Watch how this all ties together.
[time=1155] Go ahead.
[time=1156] I've been amazed to see how evangelistic 1 Peter is because of the evangelistic life of Peter.
[time=1164] And if you look at verse 5, we enter this context of moving from fear to faith, chapter 1 verse 5.
[time=1170] It says, "Who are protected by the power of God through faith, protected by the power of God through faith."
[time=1178] So see, we're either going to protect ourselves in fear or going to be protected by God through faith.
[time=1185] Let's look at chapter 2, just move forward there or backward, depending which way you call it.
[time=1190] Chapter 2 verses 13 through 17.
[time=1194] "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution." So don't be afraid to submit.
[time=1201] Have faith.
[time=1203] Whether a king is the one in authority or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and the praise of those who do right.
[time=1211] Verse 15, "For such is the will of God that by doing right, you may silence the ignorance of foolish men."
[time=1219] Act as free men.
[time=1222] Actually, what he's saying here in this context is choose to be the lowest rung on the freedom ladder.
[time=1229] He's actually using exact words that refer to the culture itself of citizenship.
[time=1235] He's saying, "Choose as free men do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bond slaves of God."
[time=1244] Honor all men, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.
[time=1248] And he goes on in verse 23 of the same chapter and says, "And while being reviled, Jesus did not revile in return."
[time=1256] "While suffering, he uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously."
[time=1265] He could have had fear, but he had faith.
[time=1269] And then it sets it up in context of verse immediately before which Steve covered last week as chapter 3, verse 12.
[time=1274] "For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears attend to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
[time=1281] If we don't do evil, which comes out of a heart of fear, then we don't have to fear, but we can live a life of faith entrusting God.
[time=1293] And so that's what we're going to see here today is as we communicate the life of Christ, we move from fear to faith.
[time=1300] Number one, if you're taking notes, write this down, don't fear, don't fear.
[time=1305] These first couple of verses give a clear picture of the kind of things that we need to face with great courage and trust.
[time=1315] Don't fear doing good.
[time=1317] Write that down.
[time=1318] Don't fear.
[time=1319] Number one, doing good.
[time=1320] And again, whatever situation you find yourself in, if you think about the context, Mitch just took us through.
[time=1326] It could be with government.
[time=1328] It could be with some official, some authority figure.
[time=1331] It could be with your employer or employee.
[time=1334] It could be a work situation.
[time=1335] It could be in your marriage with a husband or a wife.
[time=1339] It could be with a friendship.
[time=1340] There could be some situation in which you find yourself today facing great difficulty and challenge.
[time=1347] And he is saying to you, don't be afraid.
[time=1351] Don't fear, number one, in the midst of that, whatever it might be, don't fear doing good.
[time=1357] Keep doing good.
[time=1359] Look at verse 13, who is there to harm you?
[time=1363] Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?
[time=1369] When faced with hostility, when faced with difficulty, remember, this is just a very basic principle that you and I need to remember again and again and again.
[time=1378] You may be confused.
[time=1379] It may be a little bit sticky.
[time=1381] You may not quite be sure what's all going on, but one thing you can do is you and I can in the midst of that, always just do the right thing.
[time=1392] Do good.
[time=1395] And don't be afraid.
[time=1397] Do good.
[time=1398] And he doesn't just say do good.
[time=1400] He says, who is there to harm you if you prove zealous?
[time=1403] Look at that word.
[time=1404] Write it down in your notes.
[time=1406] He says that you and I are to be zealous in our attempts to do good in whatever difficulty or in whatever trial we might be facing.
[time=1418] Now the word zealous is an interesting word.
[time=1420] It was fascinating for me to learn this week that it means enthusiasm.
[time=1424] It means great or extreme intensity, great or extreme intensity.
[time=1431] The word zealous referred directly to a group of people, an organization if you will, in New Testament times.
[time=1438] They were a faction of extremists.
[time=1442] They were called zealotes.
[time=1446] Zealots.
[time=1447] It was a real bunch of folks who existed really in that time.
[time=1452] And they were Jews.
[time=1454] They were Jews who were deeply and passionately committed to doing everything that they might have to do in order to free those other Jews held in bondage by foreign captors.
[time=1470] So if there were Jewish people who were being held captive by some foreign nation, it was the zealots who would go and get them.
[time=1478] And they would steal and they would lie and they would kill and assassinate and sabotage and they would stop at absolutely nothing.
[time=1486] They were so devoted to their cause.
[time=1491] And God knew that and Peter knew that and the use of the word here I don't think is by chance.
[time=1496] And though he wouldn't call you and I to kill and steal and assassinate and sabotage, no, he says be zealous, be zealots.
[time=1506] In other words, stop at absolutely nothing.
[time=1509] Be that devoted to doing what is good and right and true in the midst of whatever hostility you might be facing.
[time=1518] Peter says, I know these are challenging scary times. These people were facing a great deal of persecution and suffering.
[time=1528] You may be facing a great deal of confusion and difficulty, persecution and suffering.
[time=1534] It may have to do with your marriage.
[time=1537] It may have to do with the situation at work.
[time=1539] It may have to do with a difficult neighbor.
[time=1541] It could be a friendship that's gone south.
[time=1543] But either way, Peter says don't be afraid. Keep zealously doing good.
[time=1550] And I love how the verse begins.
[time=1553] Besides, he says in essence, who can harm you?
[time=1560] I mean really.
[time=1562] He says, let's just think about it.
[time=1565] I mean, let's just really think about who can harm you? Who can really bring damage to you?
[time=1574] When the God of heaven and earth says in Romans 8, there is nothing that can separate you from his love.
[time=1583] So who can harm you? Do good. Do good zealously.
[time=1587] You might say, well, how do I do that?
[time=1590] How do I do good? And I want you to write the word down serve.
[time=1596] Serve.
[time=1598] What Peter's saying is it's really really hard to do harm to a servant.
[time=1603] Somebody's heart is desiring to serve other people.
[time=1608] So in the marketplace, in your job, in your home, wherever it is, you encounter anybody, especially those far from God.
[time=1617] Serve them. Serve them.
[time=1620] We have a wonderful team of people here who have continued to lead us in an effort called NeighborLink.
[time=1626] And it's where we go serve people in need just because of the love of Christ.
[time=1634] And their story after story of a person who's been served, who now is assimilated into the church, into a local body of believers in Fort Wayne.
[time=1645] And it's unbelievable. It's absolutely amazing. And I can't do anything.
[time=1651] I can't do anything. I'm kind of the cheerleader if I go, and I might carry some stuff or something like that.
[time=1657] But I can't do a thing, but you know what? I can join that deal and serve.
[time=1662] Knock down offense once. You know, I can serve.
[time=1666] You can too.
[time=1668] The third Saturday of every month from 9 to noon, you're done at noon.
[time=1672] The third Saturday of every month from 9 to noon for people who aren't going on to the website and doing this on a weekly or daily basis.
[time=1678] We go as a church, anybody who wants to. And so you might want to write that down. The next one will be July.
[time=1683] The third Saturday morning in July, 9 to noon.
[time=1686] Come out with us and just go serve some people in need who otherwise probably aren't going to be served.
[time=1692] And it's amazing what it does to your heart.
[time=1695] And if you went out and you served and you come home and your wife asked you to do something, you got more of a servant's heart to do it.
[time=1702] And it's really, and the same thing happens at work, you know?
[time=1705] And it's just this power of serving. So don't fear doing good, serve.
[time=1711] Serve those in need and then don't forget, again, serving those who are hostile.
[time=1719] It's important that we keep that in mind. And I don't know who that is for you.
[time=1724] I don't know what the circumstance is that you may find yourself in this morning.
[time=1728] But Mitch makes a great, great point. One of the ways that you and I can be most impactful.
[time=1734] One of the ways you and I can be most obedient.
[time=1737] One of the ways that we can move from fear to faith is to with those who are hostile to look for opportunities to serve them.
[time=1746] To extend yourself kindly with an act of service. Don't fear doing good.
[time=1754] Don't fear, look at verse 14. Don't fear suffering. Write that down because that might happen.
[time=1762] You know that, right? Look at verse 14. But even if you should, it's almost implied that you very well may.
[time=1770] But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed.
[time=1776] And do not fear their intimidation and do not be troubled.
[time=1781] I love God's Word. I love God's Word for many, many reasons. One of them is its honesty.
[time=1787] And I love how Peter says this right here. He says, "You know what folks? It very well may happen.
[time=1793] You may zealously do good. You may in the midst of whatever hostile situation, even as you attempt to share your faith, you may zealously do good.
[time=1803] And in the end, he may or she may or they may rake you over the coals.
[time=1811] You may experience suffering. It may not go well.
[time=1817] But come with me back the text. But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness,
[time=1824] and I want all of you to read these next three words out loud, ready go. You are blessed."
[time=1830] Now see, this is a paradigm shift, my friend. See, this is a perspective challenge for you and I today,
[time=1838] because you and I so many times have such difficulty connecting suffering with being blessed.
[time=1846] We just don't think that way. We just don't view it that way. That's not in our human nature and it's not in society today and it's not how many of us think.
[time=1856] But the fact of the matter is God's Word calls you and I today to view this and to see this and to live this with his perspective.
[time=1864] And his perspective is do good. Do good zealously. And even if you do good zealously and you suffer, it's all right.
[time=1874] You will be, say it, blessed. I think of Daniel.
[time=1883] I think of Daniel. All Daniel did was, I mean, just 12, 13 years old, he just got kidnapped by a maniacal king who was out of his mind.
[time=1891] Nebuchadnezzar taken to a foreign land, 1,500, 2,000 miles away from home. All Daniel did was just stick to his diet regimen, stick to his lifestyle function with great integrity.
[time=1903] He just did good. And as he got older, he rose in stature and power and those guys, they just hated him. They despised him. They were jealous of him.
[time=1913] So they concoct the law and Darius signs it and all of a sudden, Daniel's busted for praying to God and tossed in the lines, Dan.
[time=1922] Most of you know the end of that story. He didn't get eaten. He was saved. God brought blessing.
[time=1929] But he went through it. Boy, he went through it. I think about Job. Remember Job?
[time=1936] Job has it relates to good, probably the goodest guy on the planet. Right? Can I say that word that way?
[time=1945] Sure. You said a niacal.
[time=1949] Maniacal. Oh, what's that mean? Maniac. I thought you said a niacal. No, maniacal. I like that word.
[time=1957] Job was good. Job had a life of goodness. And everything gets taken. Everything gets lost.
[time=1967] It loses it all life, family and property and everything's gone. And in the end, God bless us.
[time=1979] I think about Jesus. came and did what? Good. Did good zealously. Did it gooder than anybody ever did good.
[time=1991] I'm killing the word I know, but are you with me? He was good. And he suffered.
[time=1999] They didn't listen. They rejected him. And in the end, he was what? Blessed.
[time=2007] Look at 1 Peter 5. You know what? You and I need new perspective on this. We need to be renewed in our minds as to how this can play out.
[time=2016] Look at, look at, go back to verse 9. 1 Peter 5, 9. I want to start at 9.
[time=2022] Look at 1 Peter 5, 9. 1 Peter 5, 9 says, but resist him. Firm in your faith, the devil. It's referring to.
[time=2030] Resist him. Firm in your what? Faith. Moving from fear to faith. Knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.
[time=2041] And after you have suffered for a, here's perspective, for a little while. The God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself bless you.
[time=2054] Will himself perfect you, confirm you, strengthen you and establish you to him be dominion forever and ever, amen?
[time=2065] 2 Corinthians 4, 16. Go back to 2 Corinthians, chapter 4. You can look on with someone else. Maybe if you don't have your Bible, 2 Corinthians 4, 16.
[time=2077] Says there, here's some perspective for you. Therefore, we do not lose heart. But though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.
[time=2088] Therefore, here's perspective for momentary light, affliction, is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison.
[time=2100] While we look not at the things which are seen, fear, but at the things which are not seen, faith, blessing, for the things which are seen, suffering, are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal, blessing.
[time=2117] Don't fear doing good. Who's going to harm you? Really. Don't fear suffering. Be fearless. Be willing to do what is right. And he promises one way or another. He is going to bless you.
[time=2138] Paul goes on in that passage in Corinthians 5, 7 to walk by faith and not by sight. Like Kelly said. He walked by faith by trusting in God, not by sight, in fearing because I'm really trusting in myself and the world's ways.
[time=2157] When Peter wrote this letter, I mentioned this at the beginning of the series, when Peter wrote this letter, they were not just experiencing what was going on in Rome where they were being made human tortures for being tortures for being believers.
[time=2170] But outside of there, there was kind of a subtle persecution if you were considered non-patriotic because you didn't worship the government.
[time=2180] And so you kind of take a hit on that. You were considered not family oriented because you didn't go to social functions because they were at the pagan temples. So you took a hit on that.
[time=2190] You took a hit in the business, in the economy, in the business community because you didn't participate in the guilds that took place at pagan temples.
[time=2200] And so there was a subtle pressure against them for having faith. And so fear could raise its ugly head. Well, what about you?
[time=2214] Do you ever get any marketplace pressure for your faith? Every getting relational pressure for your faith? Peter says, don't be afraid of that suffering because you're blessed.
[time=2232] So if you don't get the promotion, if you don't get the position, those titles, those things that you can see, you're blessed.
[time=2239] Don't be afraid. Have faith in Christ. Continue to live out, to be an evangelist, to live out your faith where every encounter is an appointment to reveal the heart of Christ.
[time=2252] And that's what we see here. We see this transition in the text that he says, you know, don't fear, but have faith.
[time=2261] He tells us again and again again that we know how this deal ends, so why would you be afraid? It's kind of like if we were all on the NCAA finals championship team and we were told before we entered the tournament that we're going to win.
[time=2276] And we knew we were going to win. So why in the world would we ever get miffed about a bad call? That doesn't make sense, does it? We know we're going to win.
[time=2287] Well, we know what's going to happen and Perioder tells us again and again that God wins.
[time=2292] Christ is vindicated. So you don't need to be afraid and get miffed about the suffering that's around you. You can have faith in Christ.
[time=2304] And the first thing that we see is in verse 15 that faith sets apart Christ as Lord. Faith sets apart Christ as Lord.
[time=2319] Remember the fear that I'm not worthy? Well, here's the answer. Here's what makes you worthy.
[time=2327] But sanctify or set apart Christ as Lord in your hearts. God says if Christ is Lord of your heart, you're worthy to communicate who He is.
[time=2341] It's based on the atonement of another. It's based on someone else, Christ.
[time=2346] And your heart is your mind, your will, your emotions, your spirit. If you want to write that down, your mind, your emotions, your will, your spirit.
[time=2353] It's with my mind that I have my thoughts. I think I process images and information.
[time=2358] It's with my emotions that I feel. It's with my will that I choose.
[time=2363] It's with my spirit that I move through all those to connect to God, vertically, my prayers.
[time=2371] And I surrender all of those to Christ as Lord. Every thought, every feeling, every choice, every prayer is made to Christ as Lord.
[time=2381] You might want to write the image of clay down, of clay. It's allowing Christ to shape everything in my heart, to be a servant of Christ.
[time=2393] And it changes your life. It reminds me of Isaiah 64, 6, which says my righteousness, I confess that my righteousness is just filthy rags.
[time=2402] I'll never get there on my own. I am not worthy on my own.
[time=2406] But when Christ is Lord, it goes on to verses later, Isaiah 64, 8. He's the potter. I'm the clay. He shapes my heart.
[time=2414] See, this wasn't Peter's idea. I got it from Jesus. I turned to Matthew 10, verse 26. We're going to look at verses 26 through 33, Matthew 10, verses 26 through 33, contrasting fear to faith, moving from fear to faith.
[time=2435] Jesus says, "Do not fear them. Those who are going to bump up against you because of your faith.
[time=2442] For there's nothing concealed that will not be revealed or hidden that will not be known." What I tell you in the darkness, I love this verse. What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light.
[time=2452] And what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops.
[time=2457] "Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul, but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body and hell." See, don't fear man, fear or revere God of faith in him, verse 29.
[time=2478] Are not too sparrows, we're not going to see why you can trust him. Are not too sparrows sold for a cent and yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father?
[time=2487] But the very hairs of your head are all numbered, no matter how few. It says in the amplified version.
[time=2500] So, do not fear. It's talking about how God intimately cares for you. That's why you can trust him. So, do not fear. You are more valuable than many sparrows.
[time=2510] Therefore, everyone who confesses me before men, I will confess him before my father who is in heaven, set apart Christ's Lord.
[time=2519] And now we're going to say the converse here. This is serious. Whoever denies me before men, so if you're not going to do it before men, I will also deny him before my father who is in heaven.
[time=2529] I'm not worthy. No, Christ is Lord of your life. In your heart set apart Christ is Lord and God says you're worthy.
[time=2537] You're worthy to share your faith. Be clay. Surrender all of your heart to him. Make him Lord of your life. Take yourself off the CEO seat of your life.
[time=2547] What was the second fear that we have in sharing our faith? The fear that I won't have all the answers.
[time=2556] And so look what he says next. Faith gives an answer. Faith gives an answer for hope. It's important that you see that and we see it right there in the text.
[time=2567] Verse 15, "But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you."
[time=2579] Write that down. Number two, faith gives an answer for hope. In my translation, it says there to make a defense to everyone who asks you might say give an account.
[time=2591] The Greek word there is write this down. Logos. L-O-G-O-S. You and I in that situation give a logos. We give a word. It means to communicate or articulate a truth.
[time=2608] It is a message. It is a proclaiming or explaining of that which is true. And you're sitting there going wait a minute. I thought faith gave the answer.
[time=2620] Sounds like I'm supposed to give the answer. And as is so many times the case, both are true. And I want you to be relieved by that.
[time=2631] I know many of you in the room today, many of you find it very disconcerting. You find yourself in the midst of much fear if we get on to the discussion of you in a discussion with one or two or three folks and them asking you a question having to do with your faith.
[time=2648] And I know many of you, you love the Lord. You have great faith. But you're fearful of what it is you would say. And what I want you to catch this morning is this, that your faith, your active growing faith, your relationship with him that leads you on a regular basis to delve into this, to learn and to know this.
[time=2673] That faith that moves you into community and vital relationship with others where your perspective has sharpened and your understanding is heightened. See your faith, your active growing faith that leads you to this and leads you to others, it grows you and it establishes you and it allows you more and more so in time to have an answer.
[time=2699] When someone says to you, see or when someone asks you, and I'll just say this to you today, I believe with all my heart, I think Mitch feels the same way, I know many of you do, I believe fully surrendered living.
[time=2712] I believe fully surrendered living, whoever you are, young women, young men, adults, moms, dads, senior adult, doesn't matter, I believe fully surrendered living brings questions.
[time=2727] When you live that way, really live that way, you get asked, it'll happen. And if you're mindful enough and if you care enough to build those relationships, they ask fully surrendered living brings questions.
[time=2742] And so they say to you, why do you believe this book, why do you believe, the more I'm around you, the more I'm with you, the more I realize you, they say to you, you really believe this, why do you believe this to be so true and you say, what do you say?
[time=2763] How will you answer? They say, what is this about being saved? Well, why is it that somebody needs to be saved and you say, what will you say?
[time=2780] And they say, how come, you know, I like, you know, but like, whenever we all go and do this, you never seem to come and do that with us, why don't you come and do that with us?
[time=2792] And do you say, what?
[time=2797] And that's not meant, I'm not saying it this way to put more pressure on you, because it's not you, and that should be a relief.
[time=2805] Do you know how relieved I am? I don't know if I've shared this with you before. If I were answering Mitch's question earlier about fears, if I had gone the series route, I fear, I fear this.
[time=2821] It's not so much the public speaking. I'm all right with that. I fear that one day you might know how little of this I really know or understand.
[time=2837] I fear that my incompetence might come out. I fear that somehow, someway, I might be in a situation and you might see that I don't know this the way you think I know this.
[time=2852] But see, I'm so thankful at the same time because my faith gives an answer. I'm just in it with you. And I'm reading and I'm studying and I'm learning and I'm listening and my faith, my growing active faith allows me to just stay at that and off we go.
[time=2874] And it's the same for you. Your faith gives an answer. Your fully surrendered living brings the questions. Here's my greatest fear for you. Hear me. Please.
[time=2886] If you're asleep, wake up and hear this one.
[time=2890] My greatest fear for you isn't that you would answer the questions wrongly.
[time=2896] It's that they would never ask you any questions because they will ask questions to those who they notice and sense have something in them that's different and distinct and special.
[time=2913] So live, live by faith, not by fear. Faith gives an answer.
[time=2918] Number three, well remember the third fear is I'll create conflict. I don't have time for that. I'll just create some kind of tension and I don't have time for that.
[time=2925] Well, we see third there that faith is gentle and respectful. Faith is gentle and respectful. It says give the account for the hope that is in you with gentleness and reverence with gentleness and reverence.
[time=2940] How do I do that? Share your story. Give the reason for the hope that you have.
[time=2950] It might be your conversion experience. It might not. It might be higher experiencing God in a new trial in your life or the joy that you have in your intimacy with God from that morning and the time with Him.
[time=2961] But have a natural outflow because you set apart in your heart crisis, Lord. Because you prepared for an answer, you're in a community with other believers and you do study the Bible and you do pray and you are experiencing God in life.
[time=2978] Not just knowledge, head knowledge, but experience in life, then you have an answer and you give it with gentleness and respect.
[time=2986] Gentleness is humility. It's my humility so the power of the Holy Spirit comes out. It's very simple. So I'm gentle.
[time=2993] What I'm doing is I'm honoring the dignity of the story of someone far from God. God created that human being.
[time=3000] And I need to honor that person and that's what reverence does and respect means I honor. I actually come down.
[time=3007] Remember, I'm going to create a bunch of conflict. I actually come down from the bottom up is how I communicate Christ and that's how I give my answer.
[time=3015] My wife and I were talking about this. We're riding bikes the other morning. I was talking about this very thing because God keeps bringing people in her life.
[time=3023] And she fears not having the answers. And so I say, "Hey, I'm just going to give you three things. I want you to write these three things down on how to do it with gentleness and respect."
[time=3033] So the first one is I said, "Just listen to them, Susan. Their words are indicative of their hearts. There's a motive in their hearts that's different than their words.
[time=3042] It might be the same, but their words are trying to describe something in their hearts." So listen to what they're saying. Did she write these down while she was riding the bike?
[time=3052] No, I tried to make images so she could remember. So listen, the second thing is connect.
[time=3060] Connect at the heart level and a real simple way to do that. Am I putting quotes and print this? Me too.
[time=3066] Yeah, me too. I understand. It doesn't guarantee you wherever they are, the heart condition is one that you can identify with. Me too.
[time=3076] Now there's common ground which exists anyway, but we've now affirmed it in the relationship.
[time=3081] So listen to their heart and then connect. Yeah, me too. And then the third one is guide.
[time=3089] Guide them either to the scriptures to the Bible because you study diverse. It applies to their life and situation. That's beautiful when that happens.
[time=3099] Guide them to other people of God, somebody who would have the answer, somebody who has experience exactly what they're going through.
[time=3107] Guide them to them. That's the value being in community here. That's part of always being prepared.
[time=3112] And then finally guide them to the spirit of God. So we're guiding them to the word of God, the people of God, the spirit of God. Guide them to the spirit of God.
[time=3118] And say, "Hey, why don't you just take an experiment and go pray about that?" I know God. His name is Jesus Christ, the Lord. Why don't you just go pray to Him and tell Him about this and just let's see what happens.
[time=3131] So you direct them, you guide them to the word of God, to the people of God, to the spirit of God and you don't have to go it alone and you do it with gentleness and respect.
[time=3140] And you don't have to worry about creating this conflict because you're doing it in humility.
[time=3144] Fourth fear that we have is I can't convince them anyway. I can't convince them anyway.
[time=3151] Remember that from when Mitch said that earlier, we all fear at times that we can't convince them, understand this point number four. Faith convicts.
[time=3162] Faith. Yours. Your active faith being lived out. Your faith. Your growing relationship with Him.
[time=3172] You resting not fearfully in yourself, but faithfully in Him. Faith, my friends, convicts. It is the only thing that convinces.
[time=3181] Faith convicts those who are hostile. Now watch this. Watch how all this ties together.
[time=3187] When you do good zealously, when you suffer faithfully and fearlessly, when Christ has been set apart as Lord, when answers have been lovingly offered,
[time=3199] when faith has been authentically and respectfully, gently and graciously lived out, when those things happen.
[time=3211] Guess what he does sometimes. Guess what can happen? I'll tell you what can happen. The hostile, the mean-spirited, the spiritually intolerant,
[time=3222] the jerk can become a soft-hearted grace-giving follower of Christ.
[time=3235] There's an individual here in this room this morning. It's amazing. There was one first hour and there's actually a couple that I know of in this room this hour.
[time=3249] There's a couple of individuals here right now and they were a few years ago, jerks, hostile, spiritually intolerant. If you had heard the things that they had spoken,
[time=3266] if you had heard the things that they said, if you had sensed and seen the almost rage they had toward that which was good and true and right.
[time=3277] And you know what I can think of in one of those situations here, here in this room this morning, in one of those situations it was a wife.
[time=3285] It was a wife who did good zealously, who suffered faithfully yet without fear.
[time=3297] She set apart Christ as Lord in her heart and she did it definitively. She did it boldly. She did it clearly.
[time=3305] She gave answers when asked and she did it lovingly. Her faith was authentically and respectfully lived out.
[time=3315] And a hard heart was in time, key phrase there, in time softened.
[time=3324] There was doing good, there was suffering and there was in time blessing. And if you've experienced that, then you can yourself, you can know.
[time=3336] And you've realized it, you've sensed it and seen it yourself, how good and how sweet that is.
[time=3342] If you haven't, hang on. You hang on. You ask for whatever help you may need.
[time=3349] You ask for whatever encouragement you may be lacking, but you hang on.
[time=3354] Because there is life and there is hope when you're willing to live by faith and not by fear. Amen?
[time=3364] Would you stand with us today? Would you bow your heads as you do so?
[time=3371] And let me just ask you this, with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, you may be here this morning and you may not, in all honesty, before God, you would know this.
[time=3381] It's between you and him, but you may know today as you stand here that you don't know him personally.
[time=3389] You may know about him, but you have not come to that point yet where you have spoken, you have believed in your heart and you have said from your mouth as it says there in Romans 10 that Jesus is Lord.
[time=3400] You have not fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=3405] And I want to just give you an opportunity this morning to just say these words in the quietness of your heart, just privately as you stand there.
[time=3413] And others of you pray, pray for those who would need to and maybe will this morning say these words.
[time=3419] If you need to know him, if you need faith, the comfort of faith, the promise and the hope of faith,
[time=3427] and you want to move away from the fear of living life on your own, you need to say these words to him, Father God in heaven.
[time=3437] I am a sinner.
[time=3440] And in my sin and humanness, I live in fear.
[time=3447] Oh God, thank you for the sacrifice of your Son. Oh God, thank you for the forgiveness of my sins.
[time=3457] Oh God, thank you for the life that you've promised me here in relationship with you and forever in heaven someday.
[time=3469] Father, in heaven I commit my life to you completely today. I surrender everything to you.
[time=3476] I surrender my heart and life to you and commit to live in relationship with you.
[time=3484] Father, thank you for these people, thank you for the friendships that I can have, thank you for the encouragement that they can bring.
[time=3493] Just say this, say thank you, God, for saving me.
[time=3498] And Father, we thank you for saving us. We thank you for the faith that you grow in our hearts in relationship with your Son.
[time=3507] And God, I pray that anyone here today who prayed that prayer would share that with us, that we could know it and come alongside them and encourage them.
[time=3515] Thank you so very much for this sweet time of worship and study in your word today.
[time=3521] Bring us back this evening at the lake for a time of celebration.
[time=3525] Thank you so much for this family, God, and all that you're doing with us.
[time=3530] We say all of this and we ask all of this in the name of your precious Son and all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3536] Hey, we'll see you at the lake, 4.30.
[time=3539] Bring a chair and some blankets, we'll see you then.
[time=3569] [BLANK_AUDIO]
