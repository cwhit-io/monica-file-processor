[time=30] (dramatic music) (upbeat music)
[time=60] (upbeat music) - Says that by no other name, do we have salvation?
[time=87] Do we stand and lift up our hands, holy hands, like the word of God says?
[time=91] No way do we stand and lift up holy hands, but by the name of Jesus Christ, through which we're saved and cleansed and washed clean in His presence.
[time=100] This morning, we're gonna sing a song that talks about Jesus and that He is God, and there's no other name beside His through which we're saved.
[time=111] It's a beautiful song, Carrie's gonna sing it for us once.
[time=116] Just listen and let the words sink deep into your hearts, and then we're gonna give you the chance to sing these words from your hearts in a minute here.
[time=125] [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=259] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, all work of Jesus.
[time=285] Jesus, there is one name that I will call, the name of Jesus, no other name can fill by the stone with such sweetness.
[time=304] There is one name that names the Son, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=333] Jesus, our Holy, Holy, and Lord to one Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=361] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=381] The name is divine, on thy lips, your spirit like water, to thy soul.
[time=395] Your word is a plan, to thy be, Jesus, I love you, I love you.
[time=411] Jesus, Jesus, that is all to me.
[time=425] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[time=548] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[time=566] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I usually start out these pre-recorded segments by saying something like I'm thankful that you've tuned
[time=577] in or I talk about how grateful I am for each and every one of you in our broadcast
[time=583] audience and I felt like today I just wanted to say this to you.
[time=587] I really, really mean that.
[time=590] We really mean it here at Black Hawk.
[time=592] We are so grateful for what God has allowed us to share with all of you who tune in each
[time=598] and every week and are a part of our family in a sense.
[time=602] You out there in the Bible, our audience, you are a part of what God is doing here and we are really grateful for you and very thankful that you tune in.
[time=612] I want you to do something for me if you would.
[time=615] Our desire is to do all that we can.
[time=617] I mean, you're going to have to kind of meet us halfway here.
[time=620] We want to do everything we can to connect with you.
[time=623] Many of you have home churches where you are significantly involved and vitally connected
[time=629] and that is a very good thing, stay at it.
[time=632] Others of you who watch each and every week, you don't have a church home.
[time=637] And not only do you not have a church home, but you don't have the communication with folks that will allow you to stay connected.
[time=643] You don't have some of the relationships that maybe you could have.
[time=647] You don't have the support that you and I both know we need.
[time=651] And so we want to do our best to come alongside.
[time=654] If you'll go to our website, here's what I want you to do.
[time=657] If you'll go to our website at blackhawkministries.org, on our home page there, you can go over
[time=664] to the left side and scroll down through the links and you can click on Bible Hour.
[time=668] Would you do that?
[time=670] Click on Bible Hour and when you go to the Bible Hour page, right over there on the right-hand side is a tan box that talks about the Bible Hour survey.
[time=679] I think the link says where you click on it says, "Take Survey." Would you do that?
[time=685] Would you take the 10 or 15 minutes it might take each and every one of you?
[time=689] We would love to hear from hundreds of you.
[time=691] We'd love to hear from thousands of you.
[time=693] We would love to better understand who you are, what your needs are, and maybe begin to figure out how we could encourage you.
[time=701] We view you as part of our family.
[time=704] You may not be here in the building every week, but you're somebody who we care about.
[time=709] And so if you could just let us get to know you a little bit better and through the survey, you could do that.
[time=715] Take the survey, please do it quickly, do it today, do it tonight, do it sometime this
[time=721] week, but go to the home page, blackhawkministries.org, click on Bible Hour, click on there where
[time=727] it says, "Take Survey" and allow us to privilege, not only getting to know you better, but allow us to begin to come alongside you, maybe in some ways that could be meaningful.
[time=737] Thank you.
[time=738] Thank you for watching.
[time=739] Thanks for being a part of what God is doing here at Blackhawk as He helps us, as He empowers
[time=746] us to help seeking people, find and follow Christ.
[time=751] God bless you.
[time=752] Have a great week.
[time=768] (Music)
[time=828] I'm going to ask Steve Longbreak, if he'd come up, Steve Longbreak is not only a wonderful
[time=857] friend, but a part of this team here at Blackhawk.
[time=861] I have the privilege of serving with Steve as part of the teaching team.
[time=866] Steve and Dr. Mitchell Cruz and myself have the privilege of doing our best with God's help to teach you on a weekly basis.
[time=874] And I am just so very grateful for Steve, and I just think it's important periodically.
[time=878] I just want to say to you how thankful I am, not only for this team that God has allowed
[time=884] me to serve in the midst of, but I'm so thankful for this guy.
[time=888] Steve is a, how do you say it, Steve, actually we're talking about it recently, and he was just in a, I don't know, way that was blowing his own horn at all.
[time=899] We were talking about something else in fact, and he mentioned that every senior pastor
[time=905] that he's worked for, maybe with the exception of Dave Jeremiah, has been older, has been
[time=912] younger than him.
[time=916] And in some cases, a lot younger than him.
[time=923] And we can laugh about that, but I just want you to recognize that and think about that.
[time=929] I have for five years felt loved, cared for, followed, respected.
[time=936] There have been times we've had to have conversations, there's been times where Steve has been the older wiser guy and set me down and help me understand some things, and there have been times when he has, as the older wiser guy, not said a thing.
[time=949] And just let me do what I felt like I should do, and there have been many a time where that's been wrong.
[time=957] And so to have that in my life is absolutely, it's just an unspeakable, you know, privilege
[time=963] to have him around, and to have him doing all that he does in men's ministry to do all that he does and race to win to do all that he does with the folks that he works with here and abroad, and to have him here today to teach you, I think it's just a real gift and privilege for us.
[time=978] I'm so thankful for him in my life, and so very thankful that he's a part of what God is doing here.
[time=983] Would you thank Steve for his service and listen to what he has to say this morning?
[time=994] Point number four is be humble, so I'll just try to work on that right now.
[time=1001] You know, anything that anybody says that's good about you, that has any spiritual significance at all, is about you simply yielding to him and him doing something through you his way
[time=1014] to the extent that you learn what the Bible says and you give up doing what you want to do that comes naturally to do what he wants you to do, then people will call that things
[time=1025] like wisdom and those, it all comes from above, it's got nothing to do with us as people other than yielding to him.
[time=1033] Well, you can live a life of six part harmony.
[time=1042] You can experience life that is real harmony, that's what this is about today, and I asked
[time=1051] the worship team if they'd stay, I'm going to throw you a big curve here.
[time=1056] Eric suggested that we do a unison there, why don't we do a note, just everybody think of a note in your mind right now, get one ready, and then all three, when I say three, all six of you sing the note that's on your mind, don't sing the one that you know that's harmony okay, you ready, have you got one, Ooh, yes, or any vowel would be fine, that
[time=1080] would be good, yes it does, one, two, three, oh yeah, yeah that's good, in our human nature,
[time=1097] in our fallen condition, we will live our own note, and it will sometimes be in agreement
[time=1112] with somebody else's note, but often it won't be, it'll be like that, that was really, really
[time=1118] bad, so it was really good.
[time=1120] Now let's do a unison note, that's nice, that's nice, and if we all were exactly the same,
[time=1132] if we were robots we'd walk around having one note to sing, wouldn't that be boring
[time=1138] though, if that was the extent of music, a note, instead God created music, and it's
[time=1149] filled with chords that are harmonious, it's a great illustration of the life that we have
[time=1155] the potential of living, listen to this six-part note, chord, oh is that good or what, oh wait
[time=1178] wait a minute do that again, that's so pretty, do it one more time, you have the potential
[time=1187] to live like that, thanks you guys, that's so nice of you to do that, yeah that was good,
[time=1195] what a great way to introduce, God has six points for us, that's why there was six-part
[time=1201] harmony up here, I asked Corbin if he could do that, I said could you get six boys, he said what we have six on our worship team this week it'll work just right, so it's perfect, God has six points for us that can introduce us to and help us live out a life
[time=1220] that is harmonious, it's in accord with him and with people and it can bring, it's not
[time=1229] dependent on good circumstances being in your life, what it's dependent on is us being yielded
[time=1237] to him and doing what he tells us to do in his word, he gives us the chart, harmony means
[time=1251] being like minded, it means agreement in opinion, get that, think about that, harmony means
[time=1261] that I walk into a room with my opinion, I meet with other people that have their opinions,
[time=1268] we then get under the authority of the word of God and discover his way for our opinions
[time=1274] to work together and we experience harmony, we walk out of the room with a collective
[time=1281] opinion, singular, we came in with opinions and we can discover through God's help what
[time=1290] our collective opinion should be and that's harmony, happens in elders meetings all the time around here, it's happened in school board meetings in my life, I've seen it in families where people come in with different opinions and some parents welcome their children's opinion more than other parents do but often they have to come to a conclusion and they come out with an opinion, being in harmony means being like minded, agreement in opinion,
[time=1318] I'll yield my opinion and my way of doing it to do it your way and it brings great harmony.
[time=1326] God wouldn't have told us to do these things in order to experience a life of harmony if
[time=1333] it weren't possible and again, hear me again, a life in six part harmony is not dependent
[time=1341] on circumstances being good in your life, not at all.
[time=1347] Let's look at 1 Peter 3 verses 8 through 12, finally interesting word there, some commentators
[time=1362] think that this finally is really introducing a brand new topic in 1 Peter 3, others think
[time=1370] that it's a culmination of what preceded the finally, remember what we've been talking about, this issue of submission, submitting toward your governing authorities there in 1 Peter 2, submitting toward your employers in the marketplace, masters and slaves it
[time=1386] talks about, submitting to your husband's wife in the home and submitting to God husbands
[time=1393] and in turn your wife as you submit one to another.
[time=1398] So this, then he finally says finally, finally, live in harmony with one another.
[time=1405] God intends for us to experience the kind of feelings that you experience when you hear that six part harmony doing its thing, live in harmony with one another, be sympathetic,
[time=1419] love as brothers, be compassionate and humble, do not repay evil with evil or insult with
[time=1425] insult but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.
[time=1430] For whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips
[time=1436] from deceitful speech, he must turn from evil and do good, he must seek peace and pursue
[time=1443] it for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer,
[time=1449] but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
[time=1455] We're going to learn today how it's possible for us to live a life of harmony.
[time=1469] I know a lot of you have experienced what it's like to be a part of a team and how important
[time=1478] it is for you to give up some of your own individual likes and dislikes to participate
[time=1485] and help the team be better.
[time=1488] Some of you have experienced that in combat, you know, in combat when you go to boot camp
[time=1494] they break you down so that your individual rights disappear and you find out what it's like to be a team member and because in combat you need to be willing to give yourself up for your team.
[time=1506] I haven't been there.
[time=1507] I wish I could give you a first hand.
[time=1509] The only thing I can talk about that's even close to that is participating in athletic teams or in the home where a team is really important.
[time=1519] On basketball team I played college basketball and one of the things I found out the first day I went to the gym was that, you know, all the guys that were on scholarship were
[time=1532] all the best players on their previous team.
[time=1537] Everybody had been used to scoring, everybody got to shoot and so there were a whole bunch
[time=1544] of us in the gym and everybody wanted to shoot and I found out that I needed to take
[time=1552] on a different role on my college team than I'd had on my high school team.
[time=1558] I shot a lot, I got to score a lot, got my name and, you know, they don't put your name in the paper very often for the guy that made the best pass of the game.
[time=1568] But I found out I needed to be a passer and there were some guys that needed to concentrate more on rebounding than on scoring.
[time=1575] There were some guys that needed to concentrate more on defense than they had in high school and you take those best players from their high school teams and you put them together and a good coach can put together a good set of standards that you live by and retrain
[time=1589] you so that you become a new team.
[time=1593] Our pivot man was really good, he was an All-American and he needed to have his hands on the ball a lot.
[time=1599] We needed to get him the ball.
[time=1600] He scored, he shot from, you know, six, eight feet.
[time=1604] His percentages were better than the rest of us.
[time=1609] To live a life of harmony means you give up some of your selfish thinking and you become
[time=1617] a team player.
[time=1624] Harmony, like-minded, agreement in opinion, the opinions become the same opinion.
[time=1636] That's what happened right here when these people, they all agreed with Corbin.
[time=1641] Corbin agreed with the chart.
[time=1646] God put the chart together.
[time=1649] Then you experience harmony.
[time=1651] Well how?
[time=1653] If that's true, then how can we do it?
[time=1655] What are the six parts here that he lays out?
[time=1657] Let's look at them one at a time first.
[time=1660] Number one, he says be sympathetic.
[time=1662] Be sympathetic.
[time=1664] He's sharing someone else's feelings.
[time=1670] Sympathetic.
[time=1672] Sharing the same feelings.
[time=1676] Romans 12, 15 says I am to rejoice with those who rejoice.
[time=1684] And it says I am to mourn with those who mourn.
[time=1689] Both those things are true.
[time=1691] I get to rejoice with you when you're rejoicing.
[time=1694] I also get to mourn with you when you're mourning.
[time=1698] Sympathy.
[time=1699] Sympathetic.
[time=1700] I had a friend whose brother died.
[time=1706] His brother was in an automobile accident.
[time=1708] We were about 16.
[time=1710] His brother was probably 19.
[time=1712] And it was really a tragic thing.
[time=1714] He got thrown out of this car and he was really not harmed physically other than it knocked him out and he landed face down in two inches of water in a ditch and he drowned.
[time=1724] And it was just his family was just struggling with it.
[time=1729] The next day my mom said to me I want you to go see Wayne.
[time=1734] And I said I don't want to.
[time=1737] She said no you need to go see him.
[time=1739] He went to our church.
[time=1740] We were friends.
[time=1742] And she said you need to go sit with Wayne at his home.
[time=1746] Man, the last thing I wanted to do on Sunday was go over to his house with all the grieving
[time=1752] family and everybody.
[time=1755] But my mom and dad they influenced me and they thought maybe I should go and so I did
[time=1762] go.
[time=1763] And I remember when I walked in the door of his house, I saw him across the room.
[time=1771] The room was filled with grieving family members.
[time=1776] And when he saw me, it was just like he headed for me and I'd said to my mom I don't know
[time=1783] what to say.
[time=1784] My mom said don't say anything.
[time=1788] That was wise counsel.
[time=1789] I said you don't have to make up some if there's nothing just naturally that you just after praying about it.
[time=1795] I think sorry you don't have to say one.
[time=1797] You know what you guys I didn't have to say a word.
[time=1801] I just was there.
[time=1802] And you know what I found out, I started grieving, I was grieving with him.
[time=1807] I took some of his burden that day and I learned a great lesson that day.
[time=1812] And I've been telling this to people ever since.
[time=1814] I call people on the phone and I say I don't know what to say to you.
[time=1817] I know I can't fix this but I do want to, I'm going to beg God that he'll let me have some of your burden.
[time=1823] There's something super, God created us in such a way.
[time=1826] And we grieve with those who grieve, they grieve less.
[time=1832] It's incredible.
[time=1834] That's why when you're surrounded by the body of Christ and you go through real trying circumstances in your life, some people can move through that miraculously it seems by
[time=1846] the strength of God.
[time=1847] But that's because to a great extent, those of us who've been surrounded, and I'm one of those I can testify to this, I've been surrounded by that more than anybody.
[time=1856] And I know, and I believe with all my heart, what God does, he said there's a piece that passes understanding, it's because you take some of my grief.
[time=1867] He wants us to do that.
[time=1872] Be sympathetic, those vibrations that are sympathetic, want to bridge, you know, when they build suspension bridges, they have to make sure that the one side's not sympathetic to the other side, because sympathetic rhythms can cause that bridge to start.
[time=1889] The wind can actually make this vibration cause this sympathetic vibration to occur,
[time=1895] and they build on each other, and bridges will fall down.
[time=1898] They cannot be in harmony, but we can.
[time=1904] Be sympathetic, grieve with those who grieve, mourn with those who mourn, and rejoice with
[time=1910] those who rejoice.
[time=1911] We get to enjoy that together too.
[time=1913] Number two, he says another way to experience a life of harmony is to love as brothers.
[time=1921] Love as brothers, that word means really to be affectionate through service.
[time=1928] I do acts of service expressing my affection for you.
[time=1934] Love as brothers.
[time=1935] He tells me to do the acts of service as though you're my brother and you are.
[time=1943] That's one of the things I love about church.
[time=1945] I like big family.
[time=1948] If I want some advice on fishing, I can go to Rayburn, and he'll tell me what I should be doing, and he could tell you how to deal with your sons too if you want to know that.
[time=1959] There's a relationship that we have as brothers in Christ.
[time=1961] There's this big family unit that we have that I love.
[time=1966] I've been the beneficiary of that a lot more than I've ever been the person sacrificing anything.
[time=1971] Love as brothers.
[time=1972] Romans 12, 10 says, "Be devoted to one another in brotherly love."
[time=1978] Same thing.
[time=1979] Brotherly love.
[time=1980] Love acts of service, affectionate acts of service.
[time=1984] Well, I'd encourage you to develop the affectionate part.
[time=1989] Think about it.
[time=1990] Do the act of service.
[time=1991] Be conscious about that.
[time=1993] Think about the fact that as an act of love, even for somebody you don't like.
[time=1999] Hear me on that one.
[time=2000] You don't have to like anybody in the room.
[time=2003] You just have to love us.
[time=2007] So if I make a conscious decision that I'm going to show my affection towards you, I'm
[time=2014] going to be loving towards you by doing an act of service, that's this word.
[time=2021] Number one, be sympathetic.
[time=2022] Number two, love as brothers.
[time=2027] I got, I have an illustration for that one too.
[time=2030] I was Gary Cooper and I went to Dominican last week and I was working there and Gary was observing some things and my luggage didn't come.
[time=2039] It's hot in the Dominican this time of year.
[time=2042] I needed my stuff that was in my suitcase and it didn't show up and so for three days I was without it and he shared his deodorant, shaving cream, razor, wasn't a place for
[time=2057] us to get one and a shirt, sorry Jennifer if you're here, it's ruined, no not really.
[time=2065] And Gary had to leave before I did, he left below, I didn't know you were here.
[time=2071] Gary had to leave before I did and he left early in the morning and I stayed in bed while
[time=2081] he was getting ready to leave and I stayed in bed when he was walking out the door and just yelled goodbye because I was going to get some more sleep he left early.
[time=2089] When I went to the sink to get ready in the morning, what do you think was there?
[time=2095] His stuff.
[time=2098] We didn't talk about it the night before, we would have a big argument about that.
[time=2102] I went in to get ready and his stuff was there for me, he left it for me.
[time=2108] You know what, that's an affectionate act of service.
[time=2111] I loved your deodorant that day man.
[time=2118] Looking for the opportunities to show your affection by doing an act of service for a
[time=2126] brother.
[time=2127] What an incredible way to experience harmony, okay?
[time=2132] You can live a life of harmony.
[time=2134] Number three, be compassionate.
[time=2140] It's really interesting, this word is really similar to number one, be sympathetic but it's like God wants to tell us, oh can I told you be sympathetic now?
[time=2149] This is sympathy in your bowels, that's what this word really means.
[time=2154] From deep inside the deepest part of who you are, be that sympathetic person by showing compassion.
[time=2163] I feel your pain from the deepest part of inside me, I feel the pain of other people.
[time=2172] He repeats sympathy with an even stronger word compassion.
[time=2176] Now folks, is it important if he repeats it?
[time=2181] You know it is.
[time=2183] We need to be really careful to think about other people considering them more important
[time=2190] than ourselves and try our best to connect with how they're feeling.
[time=2197] We say it all kinds of ways, walking in somebody else's shoes.
[time=2202] I know this much.
[time=2203] There have been very few times when anybody ever tried to hurt my feelings, very few times.
[time=2211] The truth of it is when I've been hurt it's been because people made mistakes and if I'll
[time=2217] simply put myself in their shoes and realize they've made some mistakes, if I'll think
[time=2223] about the beam in my eye when I notice the speck in theirs and I'm conscious of that it's
[time=2233] easier for me to be sympathetic and compassionate.
[time=2240] Deep simply, in Ephesians 4 it says be kind and compassionate, be compassionate.
[time=2247] God tells us to do it.
[time=2249] The other day I was working, I was facilitating this board meeting and this guy said, man,
[time=2255] he said I want to do something radical in here instead of just these things that we've been listing.
[time=2260] I said, well what would that be?
[time=2261] So I want to do something really radical.
[time=2263] I said, well what is that?
[time=2264] Share with us.
[time=2265] What's a radical idea?
[time=2266] He said, let's do these things instead of talk about them.
[time=2270] That'd be radical.
[time=2272] Wouldn't it be interesting if we left here today to try to live a life of harmony by
[time=2279] being sympathetic and loving our brothers and being compassionate, making the choices
[time=2285] to do those things instead of hear about them?
[time=2289] I remember what James says, don't be hearers of the word only and walk out of here, but
[time=2295] like a person who looks into the mirror and doesn't remember what they look like, but listen intently to the word of God and do what it says.
[time=2304] Well that compassionate thing, the illustration I thought over there was, I don't think I've ever seen anything more compassionate than a mom with a sick or hurting child or something
[time=2314] about mothers.
[time=2315] I mean, I think they take on more of the pain than maybe even is there.
[time=2323] They bore those children and there's a compassion that naturally happens in a mother that we
[time=2330] need to supernaturally see the potential of that in our relationship to other people.
[time=2340] Don't hurt a mom's child.
[time=2344] Number four, life in six part harmony, number one, be sympathetic, number two, love as brothers,
[time=2353] number three, be compassionate, number four, be humble, being humble.
[time=2360] Being humble means, I'm actually thinking about my position and choosing a lower position
[time=2368] or lower rank.
[time=2371] It's when Philippians 2 when it says consider others as more important than yourselves.
[time=2374] It's me making a conscious choice that I'm going to lower myself and elevate others.
[time=2381] That's what humble is.
[time=2384] To lower your own rank, your own position.
[time=2394] Jesus, I mean there can't be a better example than him.
[time=2400] He was God.
[time=2405] He created me.
[time=2407] In him all things hold together.
[time=2410] He was holding it all together after he created it all and then he came here to be like one
[time=2418] of the created.
[time=2421] He lowered his rank.
[time=2423] Do you know why he did it?
[time=2427] Because God the Father wanted him to.
[time=2432] And then he lived out a life on this earth in humble, remember the stable stuff?
[time=2438] He started out in humility here and then lived a humble life and then all through his ministry,
[time=2445] he said, I did not come to be served but to serve and to give my ransom for many.
[time=2452] And the why is still the same.
[time=2454] The why is the same reason he came in the first place.
[time=2456] He came to honor the Father.
[time=2458] He lived a life to honor the Father.
[time=2459] He died to honor the Father.
[time=2463] He didn't really want to die on the cross.
[time=2466] He said if there's another way to do this, you can guess some of you remember, if there's another way, let this pass, I'd like to do it a different way.
[time=2474] But your will be done, not mine, humble.
[time=2478] He chose to lower himself.
[time=2481] It says, he who was God did not consider equality with God something to be grasped.
[time=2492] But he became a man, he humbled himself.
[time=2497] One amazing truth.
[time=2499] And then he dies on the cross.
[time=2503] And in Philippians 2 it says, every knee shall bow, every tongue confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=2510] He finally gets all the praise.
[time=2512] But then the next phrase is what?
[time=2515] To the glory of God the Father, even in his, even when every single knee is going to bow
[time=2521] and every tongue confess, the glory goes to his Father.
[time=2525] Perfect in humility, perfection in humility, Jesus.
[time=2531] What an amazing example for us, and it says we're supposed to be like him.
[time=2535] That's what it says in that passage.
[time=2540] Be humble, choose a lower rank.
[time=2544] Don't demand your rights.
[time=2546] I have a friend who looks for every opportunity to be humble.
[time=2551] He, when we go to the restaurants, he tries to get ahead of everybody else so he can take the seat with his back to the view.
[time=2560] We kind of, over the years we've been fighting over this now because I learned I don't want him to get rewards in heaven.
[time=2566] So I'm trying to get there and beat him there.
[time=2572] Be humble.
[time=2573] You know, being humble is a choice.
[time=2576] It's a choice.
[time=2577] It's me saying I'm going to think of others as more important than me and treat them that way.
[time=2583] We don't have any trouble treating the people that we already think are more important than us with great grace and humility.
[time=2591] We don't have any trouble with that.
[time=2592] I guarantee you.
[time=2593] There are certain people that could walk in the room today that we all admire and you would automatically be humble in front of them.
[time=2602] And we can make that choice with each other.
[time=2605] What a privilege.
[time=2608] Number five.
[time=2610] Here's a hard one.
[time=2614] It says in verse nine, do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult.
[time=2619] Don't retaliate.
[time=2622] Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult.
[time=2626] Don't retaliate.
[time=2628] No vengeance.
[time=2630] It's not our part.
[time=2631] Romans 12, 17 says do not repay evil for evil.
[time=2634] Romans 12, 18 says do not take revenge.
[time=2639] The second part of Romans 12, 18 says leave room for God's wrath.
[time=2645] Now there's some comfort in that, isn't there?
[time=2648] We're going to leave room for his wrath.
[time=2649] He'll do it his way.
[time=2651] As a matter of fact, folks, my retaliation, thank you, thanks Carl.
[time=2666] My retaliation is probably not even close to what God can do.
[time=2673] Wouldn't it be silly for me to take his place?
[time=2680] Don't retaliate.
[time=2681] No vengeance.
[time=2684] Joseph and his brothers came to my mind.
[time=2686] They're in Genesis 45 and all of Joseph's brothers come back.
[time=2691] They're in the middle of a famine.
[time=2692] They need help and they've come to Egypt and they don't know who they're talking to.
[time=2695] When Joseph reveals himself to his brothers, instead of retaliating, remember, they put him in a pit.
[time=2702] They sold him off to Egypt.
[time=2704] He went through some hard times there, by the way, in jail, in the dungeon and they come
[time=2711] to him.
[time=2712] What it says in Genesis 45, it says that he kissed all his brothers and wept over them.
[time=2723] He didn't retaliate.
[time=2726] My dad had a gas station that he worked in.
[time=2729] It was across the street from our house and he'd come home after working at the steel
[time=2737] foundry all day and he'd go across the street to the gas station right after he ate a bite
[time=2743] and he'd work at the gas station until it closed.
[time=2746] He did that for several years while I was a kid.
[time=2750] You know, I totally took that for granted.
[time=2754] I mean, I know why he did it now.
[time=2757] I didn't realize he was doing that so he could save up the money to get us into school and pay off a house and buy the groceries.
[time=2765] He didn't make enough at the foundry to do all that stuff so he worked this job at night every night and I've grown to appreciate that a lot now.
[time=2775] But one of the things that I noticed about that job was he actually became the manager of that gas station so he pumped the gas and changed the tires and changed the oil and did all those things and there were some names that would pop up around our house.
[time=2792] That when certain names of certain people in town came up, all of us kids recognized
[time=2799] the fact that there was this silence that followed that and then we'd just move on.
[time=2803] Nobody'd ever talk about them but I always knew that there were certain names and I wondered what in the world, what's the deal with these people?
[time=2810] I was in my 30s, maybe even 40 and I asked mom to explain that to me.
[time=2815] I said, I don't understand that these certain names would come up and there'd be this silence and she said, well, I don't, you don't need to know about that.
[time=2821] I said, good grief now, I'm almost 40 years old or whatever, mom, I can handle it.
[time=2825] I'd like to know what's going on.
[time=2828] Well there were people that stiffed my dad.
[time=2832] There he was working all day at the steel foundry and then pumping gas at night and he ran tabs for some people and fixed tires for some people and they didn't have the money and they always said they'd pay later, you know, but they stiffed my dad and what I loved
[time=2847] about that most is that I didn't know it and he didn't even of, there wasn't even this
[time=2858] sense of something negative about them.
[time=2862] I just knew there was this silence, this mystique about that, you know?
[time=2866] No retaliation, no vengeance, you know what you guys?
[time=2871] My dad did just fine.
[time=2873] He didn't need that money and he didn't need for me to dislike those people.
[time=2877] He didn't need to pass on to the next generation some kind of bitterness and anger about that kind of stuff.
[time=2885] What a great example.
[time=2890] Don't retaliate, no vengeance.
[time=2894] All it does, when you see and you're jealous and you're envious and you're angry and a
[time=2900] root of bitterness takes hold there, all it does is tear me down.
[time=2906] It doesn't do a thing to the person that I'm bitter toward.
[time=2910] If I retaliate against them, there's no relief in that.
[time=2914] There is in the movies, there is in our think, but the reality is that kind of revenge does
[time=2922] not satisfy.
[time=2926] The world tells us a lie there.
[time=2928] Do you ever notice how many people that aren't the hero in the movie die in the process of
[time=2936] him getting revenge?
[time=2939] Check that out sometime.
[time=2941] As long as the hero doesn't die and he gets his revenge, we're all happy.
[time=2945] But usually there are six, eight people that died in the process, some police that are helping him or whatever.
[time=2949] I don't know where that came from, that's just an aside thing here.
[time=2954] Number six, now not only are you not supposed to retaliate, but you're supposed to give
[time=2961] a blessing.
[time=2964] Don't retaliate, don't be vengeful, but bless everyone.
[time=2969] That means speak well of others.
[time=2971] That means the people that insult you, you speak well of them.
[time=2977] The people that do harm to you, you get this word, eulogize them.
[time=2984] That's what that word means.
[time=2986] That word that is translated, bless right there, is the very word that we eulogy from.
[time=2995] You ever been to a funeral and heard a really bad eulogy?
[time=3000] All kinds of negatives?
[time=3001] I suppose it's happened, but I haven't heard many.
[time=3003] People that eulogize, and you know what, a lot of times they could say some things about people that have died, but they make a choice not to do that.
[time=3017] We talk about the good things when we eulogize someone.
[time=3023] That's what this is about, make a conscious choice, don't let yourself slip into what
[time=3029] happens naturally, be supernatural in this and give them a blessing.
[time=3034] That's exactly what Joseph did with his brothers.
[time=3036] They came in there, he wept over them, it says, and kissed them, blessing them.
[time=3045] You know who that was best for?
[time=3048] That was best for Joseph.
[time=3050] And you know what, Joseph had been experiencing a life free from the bitterness for all those
[time=3057] years.
[time=3058] He thought his brothers had been experiencing all those years.
[time=3063] Wonder what kind of thoughts had been going through their minds as they thought back about what they'd done to their brother.
[time=3069] But he was experiencing peace.
[time=3074] He kissed them.
[time=3076] Well there are two other passages that deal with this.
[time=3079] I've been quoting from Romans 12.
[time=3080] I love this.
[time=3081] God does this all the time.
[time=3084] In Romans 12 and in Philippians 2, Paul teaches the same lesson to those people in Rome and
[time=3095] in Philippi.
[time=3097] He teaches this very same lesson that Peter teaches.
[time=3101] God actually teaches the lesson through Paul almost the same words, incredible.
[time=3108] And he does that then through Peter.
[time=3110] So folks there must be something here for us that we really need to grab hold of.
[time=3114] God's emphasized it in three different passages of Scripture.
[time=3117] We can live in harmony this way.
[time=3119] Let's look at the Philippians 2 passage, 1 through 4.
[time=3123] If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make
[time=3132] my joy complete by being like-minded.
[time=3135] Did you heard that earlier, right?
[time=3138] Like-minded.
[time=3139] That's what harmony is.
[time=3141] Having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose.
[time=3145] Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better
[time=3152] than yourselves.
[time=3154] Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.
[time=3159] What would it be like if we left here today not having just heard some more words from preaching and read it, but we started to do this.
[time=3168] I mean, let's be radical the way that guy was talking about us being read.
[time=3172] Let's do it.
[time=3173] Look for the opportunities to bless those who curse you, who insult you.
[time=3179] Bless them in your heart and even bless them out loud.
[time=3185] Consider others as more important than yourself, it says.
[time=3188] That's not popular today.
[time=3189] You only hear that in church and you better hear it here.
[time=3197] Most teams, you know, listening to people be interviewed after championship games these days is a lot different than it was when I was a kid.
[time=3207] Most people are looking-okay, I brought this, they let me-I got to do, I-there's so much
[time=3213] I in there, it's unbelievable.
[time=3215] Once in a while they'll throw the team in, but it's about the contribution they were allowed to make and how hot they were that day.
[time=3223] But God says that we should consider others as more important than ourselves and live
[time=3229] for Him and them.
[time=3236] Look at 1 Peter 3, 10 through 12 again.
[time=3240] This is Psalm 34, quoted here in 1 Peter 3, says, "Whoever would love life and see good
[time=3247] days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech." That's the opposite of blessing people.
[time=3257] He must turn from evil and do good.
[time=3262] He must seek peace and pursue it.
[time=3266] I'll get this, for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive
[time=3276] to their prayer.
[time=3278] That the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
[time=3285] Do you trust Him?
[time=3289] Do you trust the fact that his eyes are on you, that he'll make things right?
[time=3296] I'll get this, in his time.
[time=3301] Sometimes his time is while we're still on the earth.
[time=3307] Sometimes his time allows for us to exist all our time before we see any of this transpire.
[time=3315] It may be that it's all going to happen in heaven and/or not be in heaven.
[time=3323] God doesn't want us to sacrifice harmonious living to carry out revenge on this earth.
[time=3331] Instead, he wants us to rest assured that his eyes are on us, that his ears hear us, and
[time=3340] that he loves us, and he'll take care of these problems.
[time=3343] Look at Hebrews chapter 4, verse 13, it says, "Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's
[time=3352] sight." Nothing.
[time=3354] I told the guys of power equipment the other day, "I'm still so stupid I sometimes think I'm alone.
[time=3362] I've been with him all these years, and I still, at times, act like even in my own head, think
[time=3369] like I'm alone, like he's not here." How foolish.
[time=3378] Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight, nothing.
[time=3384] Everything is uncovered and laid bare.
[time=3387] That's talking about being stretched across the altar when they'd stretched the lamp, laid bare before him, before the eyes of to him, of him to whom we must give account.
[time=3402] Not just us, all the people that insult us or do wrong to us.
[time=3409] We can rest in that.
[time=3412] Do you want to have a life that's like this harmony that you heard up here?
[time=3416] You want to have a life that's like the teams that are blended together, and they're all giving up their own unique desires and their natural tendencies to want to be the superstars.
[time=3426] You want to have a life like that.
[time=3427] He says, "Do these six things." Listen to them one more time.
[time=3432] Be sympathetic.
[time=3434] Love as brothers.
[time=3435] Be compassionate.
[time=3437] Be humble.
[time=3439] Don't retaliate.
[time=3446] Their response does not determine whether you get to experience harmony or not.
[time=3459] But if they respond properly to that, you can even have a harmonious life with them.
[time=3468] What would you pay?
[time=3470] What would you pay to have harmony?
[time=3477] I'd pay it all.
[time=3478] And you know what?
[time=3480] God did.
[time=3482] He paid it all so that we can experience that.
[time=3485] Aren't you thankful?
[time=3486] Now, do something radical this week.
[time=3494] Do these six instead of hearing about them.
[time=3500] Our Father in heaven, we bow down before you, our living God, and we are laid bare before
[time=3507] you.
[time=3508] Your eyes see it all, your ears hear every prayer.
[time=3513] Only you are worthy of our praise, and only you can receive comments like I just made
[time=3519] this prayer.
[time=3520] Only you are able.
[time=3523] Thank you for revealing your truth to us about how to live a life in six-part harmony.
[time=3533] God I pray that this church will be renowned for the folks who bless rather than curse,
[time=3544] who don't return evil, who guard their tongues, and live a life in harmony with you and with
[time=3552] each other because your spirit enables us to do that.
[time=3556] We're so grateful.
[time=3557] We thank you.
