[time=321] (upbeat music) Paul says in the book that feeds the dear to rejoice in the Lord always, and he says it again, rejoice.
[time=332] That's our attitude when we approach our God that we need to come with him with hearts full of joy for all the things that we've sung about.
[time=339] And for this verse in particular, my favorite, it says that mortals, we get to join this mighty chorus that began not 50 years ago, not 100 years ago, not even 1,000 or 2,000 or 8,000 years ago, but before even time itself began this mighty chorus that was praising and adoring God for who he is and all of his glory, we get to join in that.
[time=365] Sometimes I think we get a little short-sighted, we just get into the routine of coming to church every Sunday morning and we take this hour and we sing some songs, but what we're doing is it's so much bigger than that.
[time=378] So let's sing this together and let's mortals join this mighty chorus which began before the stars and we'll sing together.

[time=717] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here
[time=733] at Black Hawk Ministries, and I am so grateful to get a couple of minutes here with you.
[time=738] I really wanna say thanks to many of you who have already responded to the Bible Hour survey that we talked about a couple of weeks ago.
[time=747] Let me just refresh your memory if I can.
[time=750] We really are thankful for you.
[time=753] We know that there are hundreds, maybe even thousands of you out there, and you faithfully tune in, you know, each and every week or almost each and every week, and you don't have a church home.
[time=765] I mean, like a building and a bunch of folks that you go and are a part of.
[time=769] You kind of view this as your church home.
[time=773] We're your church in a sense, and yet our relationship, at least so far, maybe has an extended beyond this television broadcast.
[time=781] We care about you.
[time=783] We wanna help you.
[time=784] We wanna give you resources.
[time=786] We want to be able to pray for you.
[time=788] We wanna get to know you better if we can.
[time=790] And one of the ways that you can help us do that is by going to our website at blackhocministries.org.
[time=798] And when you go to blackhocministries.org, you can click on the Bible Hour link.
[time=803] And when you go to the Bible Hour page, there's a little box, a little tan box that says take Bible Hour survey.
[time=808] And if you would just today, like right now, or maybe after the broadcast is over, or sometime in the afternoon or evening, if you would just take 10, 15 minutes and go and take that survey, it may take you 10, 15 minutes to kind of keep clicking your way through.
[time=825] But if you would do that, and if you would share with us who you are and how your journey with the Lord is going, and maybe some ways that we could help you, all the questions are there.
[time=836] It prompts you to go on to the next page.
[time=839] And if you'll do that, we can respond.
[time=842] And I'm so thankful for those of you who have done it already, we have received some great insights and have actually seen some things that you've written that have really kind of allowed us to stop and think about our ministry to you.
[time=857] I got to share this one example with you.
[time=860] We heard from a woman.
[time=862] And from what we could gather on the survey, this woman and her son have had some really, really horrendous, really, really bad church experiences.
[time=875] And I don't know the story behind it.
[time=877] I'm not sure all that it entailed.
[time=880] But I do know this.
[time=881] I know that the experiences that this woman has had and the way it's left her feeling, she doesn't want to go back to church.
[time=890] And that breaks my heart.
[time=893] I mean, we hear that and we couldn't think of anything that would bring more sadness or more concern to our hearts because we believe in the church.
[time=904] We love what God's doing through our church.
[time=908] And to know that there's somebody out there, she actually said in the survey response, she said it was safer.
[time=914] It was safer for her to go to church at home, safer for her to watch a broadcast and actually go and be with a group of people.
[time=924] And I know that there are many of you out there who maybe can in some way relate to this woman.
[time=929] Maybe your experience with church in the past hasn't been very good.
[time=934] Maybe there have been folks who have taken advantage of you.
[time=937] Maybe there have been people, even in leadership, who have mistreated you or who have abused your trust.
[time=944] And I want you to know how sorry I am that that happened.
[time=948] But I want you to know that we would love to be a family for you.
[time=953] We would love to be a place where you could come, where you could meet some people where trust could be rebuilt, where relationships maybe could be restored, where you could find the joy and the thrill of being a part of something where you were loved and cared for, taught and equipped.
[time=970] And so if the broadcast is for some of you a way back, we're really, really thankful.
[time=976] And I hope that someday you'll maybe get in the car some morning and come over to 7,400 East State and give us the privilege of meeting you.
[time=984] We'd love to come alongside.
[time=986] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=988] Would you please go and take the survey on the website?
[time=991] It would mean a great deal to me.
[time=993] And I hope someday to be able to meet many of you face to face.
[time=996] We're so thankful for the privilege that God has given us to come alongside seeking people just like you, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=1005] It's what he's called us to.
[time=1006] And we're so thankful that we get to do that with people like you.
[time=1011] Have a great week.
[time=1012] God bless you.
[time=1013] And we hope to see you soon.

[time=1111] - If you would, open your Bibles to first Peter, first Peter chapter four.
[time=1116] I had a great, great opportunity this week.
[time=1118] I had a meeting in my office with a couple.
[time=1120] They are somewhat new to the Black Hawk scene and really, really enjoying kind of a new season in their life of spiritual growth, what we do here and how we do.
[time=1131] I think it's been a little bit new to them and the guy he said to me, hey, you've been in that first Peter thing for a long time.
[time=1138] And I said, you know, we have, haven't we?
[time=1141] And I just got me thinking about what a journey it's been through this great book.
[time=1145] What great truth and what great encouragement we have found.
[time=1149] If you'll remember, we entitled our series when holiness meets hostility.
[time=1155] We know that these folks were living in a hostile world.
[time=1158] We know that these folks were facing persecution and temptation that was absolutely mind-boggling.
[time=1165] And we know today that you and I face a level of suffering, a level of temptation and persecution and we need to know how best to respond.
[time=1174] And it has been such an encouragement for us to see you growing with us as we've looked at this great letter that Peter wrote.
[time=1181] We find ourselves today in first Peter chapter four versus one to six.
[time=1186] First Peter chapter four versus one to six and we come to quite a passage.
[time=1192] A passage of great importance for you and I today.
[time=1194] A passage that if you're willing and if you're ready, I believe in your heart and mind to really take in what God may have for you today.
[time=1203] I believe it could be life changing.
[time=1208] I believe it could do some things to your perspective.
[time=1211] I know it has done some things to mind and I really hope my prayer has been that you would be ready to receive what God has for you today.
[time=1218] So in honor of God's word, would you stand with me?
[time=1221] And would you allow me to read for you first Peter four versus one to six?
[time=1225] Peter writes therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves and I want to stop there.
[time=1234] We'll just do a little teaching right here.
[time=1238] In our passage today, God's word calls you and I to arm ourselves and it's a very interesting, very powerful, very important word for you and I to grab hold of this morning.
[time=1253] Says therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, you and I are to arm ourselves.
[time=1261] Pick up a weapon, be prepared, be equipped for a battle.
[time=1267] And I want you to notice the text, who is it that is to do the arming?
[time=1273] Is he gonna do this or are you and I?
[time=1275] Answer, we are.
[time=1277] It says arm yourselves.
[time=1280] We've talked about this in recent weeks, this amazing tension between what God does for us and what we do as we work out our salvation and fear and trembling.
[time=1288] Arm yourselves, the Greek word there.
[time=1291] It's interesting, there were a couple words he could have chosen, the word he chooses is the word having to do with arming yourself with a military weapon, with military armor.
[time=1302] It was the word used when someone would arm themselves with the kind of military weapons and the kind of armor that would be used in the most severe battle.
[time=1316] It wasn't the armor that they would use for just a skirmish.
[time=1320] Here he says to arm yourself with the most battle-worthy armor you can find.
[time=1328] And he says it for a reason, and we'll get to that.
[time=1332] Arm yourselves with the same purpose because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh, no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
[time=1348] For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, what that means is the desire of the flesh, the desire of those far from God, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries, and all of this, they are surprised.
[time=1371] You may know some of them.
[time=1374] Who look at you today and think, where'd you go?
[time=1380] What happened to you?
[time=1382] Says in all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation and they malign you.
[time=1393] And then a very sobering verse, verse five, but they will give an account.
[time=1399] But they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead for the gospel has for this purpose been preached, even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God.
[time=1415] Would you pray with me, Father God, we stand before you this morning in humility and with appropriate fear, God, because we know that there is a battle.
[time=1430] Now, there is a fight and God, the fight is for our souls.
[time=1434] The fight is for our lives.
[time=1436] The fight is against our ministry.
[time=1438] God, it is against our families.
[time=1440] It is against our hearts.
[time=1441] It is against our relationships.
[time=1443] God, we know the enemy comes and he comes with great energy and he stops at nothing to do all that he can to diminish your work in us.
[time=1453] And so God, as we come this morning to this passage, we pray that by your grace and through your spirit and through your word, God, that we could be armed.
[time=1462] God, that we would make choices to arm ourselves and that in doing so, God, we could fight this fight well.
[time=1470] God, give us the grace and strength to do this very thing.
[time=1473] Open our hearts and minds to your life, changing eternity, altering truth.
[time=1480] And we'll thank you for it in your son's name.
[time=1483] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1488] You know, I've told you this before, I think in the past, it may have been a few years and so there's a bunch of new folks who maybe don't know this about me, but I just got to go ahead and tell you this about me.
[time=1497] When I was 10 years old, when I was 10 years old, I had the same head and ears that I have today.
[time=1505] That's pretty scary thought.
[time=1508] And I was 10 years old, I was about five foot eight.
[time=1512] It was tall, five, seven, five, eight.
[time=1514] I weighed about 74 pounds.
[time=1516] And that might be a slight exaggeration, but believe me, not much.
[time=1520] It was a real, real sad sight.
[time=1522] I was about 10 years old and I had this head and these ears and I was just about as skinny as a pole and I loved one thing and that was basketball.
[time=1530] All I wanted to do was just play basketball.
[time=1532] No matter where I was and we moved around a lot as a kid.
[time=1535] I've told you that before my dad was in ministry and I lived in 18 different homes by the time I turned 17 and seven, eight, nine different cities and we just moved a lot.
[time=1544] So I was pretty adaptable.
[time=1546] And at some point there around the age of 10, we moved to a town.
[time=1549] It was kind of a rough, it was a different setting.
[time=1552] It wasn't like any town we'd ever moved to.
[time=1554] I noticed that quickly.
[time=1556] People weren't quite as nice.
[time=1557] The kids certainly weren't as kind and I had some real challenges immediately, especially on the playground.
[time=1565] I just wanted to play basketball and I remember almost the very first day I was there going out at recess to the basketball court and shooting around a little bit and then all of a sudden the guys came to start the game and this one little round, I'll just say round, we'll be kind and leave it at round.
[time=1578] This one little round Hispanic kid named Mark Menendez.
[time=1582] I have no idea what he had against me but he just let me know from the get go that I was not welcome to play.
[time=1586] The game was closed, stood there with his ball under his arms and said, "You can't play." And I started to say something and Mark pulled back and slugged me in the stomach as hard as he could.
[time=1598] Now I didn't have a lot of air.
[time=1599] There wasn't a lot of space in my stomach.
[time=1601] My stomach was not that big.
[time=1602] It could not hold a whole lot of air but whatever air was in me got pushed out and I fell over on the ground, doubled over in pain and embarrassment.
[time=1610] And it was clear he wasn't gonna let me play but I was pretty determined and every day, every day I went back.
[time=1618] And every day Mark Menendez slugged me in the stomach
[time=1624] and every day he bent me over and every day I crawled away from that court gasping for air and they all laughed at me.
[time=1632] And I think after a while I told my mom and dad and see my dad, he didn't want me to fight.
[time=1636] My dad just kept telling me, you know what, you're gonna have to think this one through.
[time=1640] You're gonna have to figure out a way to get along.
[time=1642] You're gonna have to wrestle with this one buddy but I don't want you firing back and so I wouldn't 'cause my dad said I couldn't.
[time=1649] Well, after weeks of not being allowed to play and being doubled over from the slug and the gut, you know, he began, I think, to get bored with me.
[time=1657] So he began to follow me home.
[time=1660] See, I walked home from school and he and some other guys would follow me home and they'd inevitably, at some point, stop me.
[time=1666] Call me names and usually about my weight and my head and my ears.
[time=1671] And then they started to kind of work me over and so it went from slugs in the gut to actually kind of some pops in the face and throw me down the ground and a few kicks here and there.
[time=1681] And one day, one day I came home and I was a little bloodied.
[time=1685] I had a lip thing, you know, right here and I had a kind of little shiner under my eye and I had just taken it and I showed my mom and it was killing her and I was back in my room that night and I'll never forget my dad came home and he just walked in the room and all he said, well, he came in and he sat down and he put his arm around me and he looked at me and I saw the little blood thing here and the shiner under the eye and he said, "Hey, do you want to play basketball tomorrow?" And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Do it." I said, "I can play." He said, "Yeah, you go ahead and play." He shut the door and it was like, "Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, I'm bouncing around that room, I'm jabbing, I'm going, I'm going to play basketball and I'm doing pushups and I'm doing sit ups because I know what's going to happen.
[time=1740] Mark Menendez is going to stand there with the ball under his arm and say that I can't play.
[time=1746] And so I'm going to finally get to play.
[time=1749] I think I got to school at six that morning and I got to that playground as soon as that bell rang after the second series of classes and there was Mark Menendez and as soon as he opened his mouth before he could say the words, "You can't play." I think I had it all the way up to my elbow down his mouth.
[time=1769] He had no idea what hit him.
[time=1774] And I think I probably, I think I hit him about 15 times in about 10 seconds and they had to get a crowbar to get me off of him.
[time=1782] Now kids in the room, there's some context to this, okay?
[time=1786] You want to talk to your parents about this.
[time=1788] There was a story behind that.
[time=1789] I'm not advocating you being a bully.
[time=1792] But my dad, you know, he'd finally given the green light.
[time=1794] Well, I went after him and I went after him with vengeance and they pulled me off him and they dragged me to the principal's office and that principal sat me down if I'm going to call your dad and I said to myself, go ahead and he called my dad and my dad came and got me and he took me to ice cream that afternoon.
[time=1817] You see, my stand, my battle against the enemy
[time=1824] had fallen painfully short for quite a period of time.
[time=1832] But then one night I was armed.
[time=1835] One night I was armed, set free by the word of my father.
[time=1840] In the past, you see, certain weapons had not been accessed but with a word I had been given the artillery needed to fight a good fight well.
[time=1851] And my friends, I got to tell you this this morning, I have told you this before, I will tell you this today and I will tell you this I'm sure again and again and again in the future.
[time=1860] First Peter five, we'll get there in a few weeks.
[time=1865] First Peter five says this, listen, listen.
[time=1868] First Peter five says that the enemy is prowling around in your world and in mine.
[time=1877] First Peter five says that a very real and deadly enemy is prowling around like a lion looking for someone to punch in the stomach.
[time=1888] It says he's looking for someone to devour.
[time=1891] You see, the enemy has as his goal, the hope and desire to absolutely ruin you, to absolutely diminish Christ's work in you and I.
[time=1901] His goal, his hope, this fight that he brings, he brings with the hope that he can diminish and completely eradicate the work of God in the lives of people like you and I.
[time=1911] He wants to destroy your mind.
[time=1914] He wants to ruin your home.
[time=1917] He wants to take those things that are not only near and dear to us, but those things that when surrendered to God can make a great difference in this world that we live in, the enemy comes with his fight to diminish it all, to wipe it out, to destroy it.
[time=1932] And listen, 'cause I've seen enough
[time=1939] and you've seen plenty and I see it again and again
[time=1945] and again, listen, he will, he will ruin you.
[time=1950] He will diminish Christ's work in you.
[time=1958] He will shatter your home.
[time=1961] He will destroy your life and ministry.
[time=1964] He will, unless you are armed properly,
[time=1970] unless you take hold of the right spiritual weapons needed to stand up and say, I am going to play.
[time=1978] You can stand there with your ball under your arm and you can tell me the game is closed and you can slug me in the stomach and expect me to crawl away, but no, I am going to play.
[time=1990] You and I can do that with the right spiritual weapons.
[time=1996] We can say to him, you will not keep me out, you will not intimidate me, you will not scare me and you certainly will not seduce me.
[time=2004] And so this morning, if you're interested, and I don't know if you are, but I hope you are, if you're interested, if you want to be armed and dangerous to him, if you want to be spiritually ready to fight and endure hostility, come with me back to our passage and we're going to look this morning at the four weapons needed for the fight, four spiritual weapons needed for this most important of all battles and it begins right there in verse one.
[time=2035] It says, therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with what?
[time=2043] Well, here we go, with the same purpose, with the same purpose because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.
[time=2052] Verse one gives us our first weapon.
[time=2054] Write this down, would you, the mind set of Christ or you could write the attitude of Christ, weapon number one in this most important of all fights is that you and I would be armed with the mindset or attitude of Christ in the Greek that phrase there, in my text it reads, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, same purpose means attitude mindset.
[time=2079] And let me ask you this, it begs the question, so what was Christ's mindset?
[time=2084] What was Christ's attitude toward the suffering and injustice and the persecution that he faced on the cross?
[time=2092] Well, the verse here gives us our answer.
[time=2094] You might say, well, what was his mindset, you know, when, what was his mindset?
[time=2098] I mean, in what setting?
[time=2099] Well, the verse here helps us.
[time=2100] You see that first word there?
[time=2102] Look at your verse there, verse one, therefore, we've taught you this in the past.
[time=2106] Whenever you see therefore, it always is referring to the context that has led up to this passage.
[time=2113] And in the flow of first Peter, when you see that therefore, at the beginning of chapter four, verse one, it takes you back to first Peter two where all of this began.
[time=2123] Will you turn back there with me?
[time=2124] Let me show you right here in your own Bible, for your own eyes to see.
[time=2129] Let me show you the mindset of Christ.
[time=2134] It says in first Peter two, verse 23,
[time=2140] and while being reviled, it's just talking about that which he endured on the cross, the hostility and the hatred and the persecution that he endured, and while verse 23, and while being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[time=2153] While suffering, he uttered no threats, but he kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously.
[time=2160] My mind goes to, I don't know about you, but my mind, I think forever now, as long as I'm alive, will go to the passion of the Christ.
[time=2167] Many of you, I know, saw the movie.
[time=2171] Many of you have read the text.
[time=2172] Many of us are very familiar.
[time=2174] Watch this, with the walk he took from that mockery of a trial.
[time=2180] Remember?
[time=2181] Remember the walk he took from the trial to Calvary?
[time=2185] And how he just kept going.
[time=2190] He faced all that he faced.
[time=2193] The punches were thrown, the whips landed, the insults were given, and he just kept going.
[time=2205] You say, it sounds like you're giving me a motivational talk here.
[time=2210] Sounds like you're trying to charge me up, well, you know what I am.
[time=2214] I believe there are people in this room this morning who need to be reminded to keep getting out of bed, to keep mothering well, to keep going to work and facing a difficult situation.
[time=2227] There are those in the room and the persecution or the suffering or the temptation that you're facing.
[time=2233] It has been a worrisome battle for you, and there are times when you and I need to be reminded that he just kept going.
[time=2240] He kept taking one step after the other.
[time=2245] And he in essence with his mindset, I mean, I want you to think about it, with his mindset, with his attitude, he in essence says, "I am going to go through this." He didn't go around it, he didn't go under it, he didn't back up.
[time=2261] He kept entrusting himself to the one who judges righteously and he kept going.
[time=2268] I will not shrink back.
[time=2269] I am going to finish this.
[time=2271] I am not going away.
[time=2274] And part of me wants to motivate you and challenge you and inspire you and part of me wants to get on my knees and just beg you to please not stop.
[time=2289] Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9, "Run in such a way that you may what?
[time=2293] "Win.
[time=2295] "And I want you to run.
[time=2297] "I want you to crawl if you have to.
[time=2300] "And I want you to ask for help if that's needed.
[time=2303] "But I want us to have this number one weapon, "this mindset of Christ.
[time=2307] "Christ had to die to finish.
[time=2312] "There are Christ followers today in this world "who are dying to finish.
[time=2317] "You and I probably won't have to do that, "but we may need to endure.
[time=2322] "You may need to persevere.
[time=2324] "You may need to get out of bed and continue to come to this "and continue to live in community "and continue to claim the hope that we'll get to "even here at the end of our passage." Some of you in the room this morning need to say this.
[time=2340] And let me just, some of you here may not need to say this, but I'm going to invite you right now.
[time=2347] For those of you in the room today who need to say this, who needed today to be reminded of Christ's attitude, and this weapon that we're able to have of moving forward with great determination and faithfulness.
[time=2362] Some of you in the room this morning need to say this quietly.
[time=2365] I won't have you say it out loud.
[time=2366] I'll just have you say it in the quietness of your heart.
[time=2369] Some of you need to repeat this, and I want you to do it right now.
[time=2372] You need to say to God and yourself, "I will go through this." I don't know what it is, but I can imagine.
[time=2384] And some of you this morning as you take on, as you arm yourself, some of you need to say that to him.
[time=2391] Again, I will go by your grace and with your strength.
[time=2396] I, it may be a marriage.
[time=2400] It may be a wandering child, it might be a work situation.
[time=2404] It could be medical, and you may be afraid and you may be hurting, you may be scared, you may be hopeless, but today God says arm yourself.
[time=2414] You can get through this battle.
[time=2415] Number one, with the mindset of Christ that says, "I will go through this." Say that to him.
[time=2422] Say that to yourself.
[time=2425] And tell yourself this, while you're saying that, tell yourself, as you're saying, God, by your grace and with your strength, I will go through this.
[time=2433] Say to him, "And I will come to the word of God for direction, and I will rely on the spirit of God for comfort, and I will look to the people of God for accountability and encouragement." Number one, he says, arm yourselves, with the mindset of Christ.
[time=2451] Number two, write this down.
[time=2453] Weapon number two, the will of God.
[time=2456] The will of God.
[time=2457] You say, "What does that mean?" Well, let's read verse two, back to first Peter four.
[time=2461] It says in first Peter four, verse two, "So as to live, arm yourself with the same purpose.
[time=2468] Put on the mindset of Christ." Verse two, "So as to live the rest of the time in the flesh, no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God." We'll keep this real short and simple, okay?
[time=2484] Here you go.
[time=2485] Number two is a mindset as well.
[time=2488] And it's very uncomplicated.
[time=2490] Here you go.
[time=2491] Here's the question.
[time=2492] Here's verse two.
[time=2493] Here's weapon number two.
[time=2494] Here's the whole will of God thing right here.
[time=2496] Will you?
[time=2497] Will you, with the rest of your days here in this life,
[time=2503] will you live, choose, and prioritize?
[time=2507] In such a way as to further your lusts, your desires, your plans, or gods.
[time=2515] It's almost like we're dealing with kids here.
[time=2520] And I guess in a sense, we are.
[time=2525] It's like this, whose will will win?
[time=2531] When it's all said and done, what kind of a Christ follower will you be?
[time=2540] Whose will?
[time=2542] Bottom line, what is the grid really now?
[time=2546] In all of life, what is the grid through which you and I are going to live, choose, and prioritize?
[time=2556] He says, arm yourself with a grid that says down deep inside, I will live, choose, and prioritize.
[time=2564] I will face whatever it is I'm facing.
[time=2568] And I will do it God's way.
[time=2570] I will parent God's way.
[time=2572] I will conduct myself physically in a dating relationship.
[time=2576] God's way.
[time=2577] I will handle my finances.
[time=2579] God's way.
[time=2580] I will give myself to my spouse God's way.
[time=2584] And most importantly, most assuredly, as it relates to our text, in the midst of trial, in the midst of persecution and suffering, I will face this battle.
[time=2596] I will come up against this attack and I will choose God's will, not mine.
[time=2602] And I hear it, you hear it, we see it all the time.
[time=2605] I hear folks say, this is really what we think we should do.
[time=2611] I should qualify that.
[time=2615] I hear people say that and I hear myself say that.
[time=2620] I really think we say, we really think this is what we should do.
[time=2627] I really feel like deep in my heart that this is okay.
[time=2630] It makes sense, they say, or it's logical.
[time=2633] I mean, what else am I gonna do?
[time=2635] And today, here at this point, it's just a reminder to you and I that in every single arena of life, he gives you the opportunity to be armed with his will.
[time=2648] You say, okay, okay, okay, how do you know his will?
[time=2650] How can I face all of this and choose his will and not mine?
[time=2655] Well, we've talked about this before, three things.
[time=2657] Some of you know these three things.
[time=2658] Others of you, this might be new news to you.
[time=2660] Number one, write this down, the word of God.
[time=2663] Number two, the spirit of God.
[time=2665] And number three, the people of God.
[time=2667] See, you can know God's will for your life.
[time=2670] Sometimes he clearly states it for you right here in the pages of scripture, the word of God.
[time=2675] Other times he will prompt you.
[time=2677] Other times he will nudge you.
[time=2679] Other times the spirit of God convicts and moves and you get a clear sense for what he's doing.
[time=2686] That though, it's always important to kind of check that one with the third one, which is wise counsel.
[time=2693] What do the people that know you best say?
[time=2696] The word of God, the spirit of God and the people of God.
[time=2700] God's will at the very core of all that you do.
[time=2704] Number three, a third weapon needed in the fight.
[time=2708] Write this down, would you transformed desires?
[time=2713] Transformed desires.
[time=2716] Says if you and I are gonna fight this fight well, we have got to be a people whose desires that which we long for.
[time=2724] We gotta be a people whose desires have been changed.
[time=2727] Altered, come with me back to our passage.
[time=2730] Verse three says, for the time already passed, it's sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, the desire of the flesh, the desire of those far from God.
[time=2742] Having pursued past tense.
[time=2745] As verse is talking about life outside of prior to relationship with Christ, Peter knew that these individuals had lived life outside of a fully surrendered relationship to him and he reminds them of what that life looked like, what those old desires led to.
[time=2766] For you to have carried out the desires of the Gentiles having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries.
[time=2784] In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excess of dissipation and they malign you, but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
[time=2800] And you can stop right there.
[time=2802] Part of the arsenal that arms us to face all that the enemy will send our way is a completely altered set of desires.
[time=2814] Do you remember him doing that with you?
[time=2819] I remember him doing that with me.
[time=2823] I really do.
[time=2824] I remember him changing the things that I wanted.
[time=2832] And the state that my life was in when he saved me, when he brought me to himself.
[time=2838] I mean, we've talked about that before.
[time=2840] There were some radical changes that took place.
[time=2844] And he says, "Time is of the essence.
[time=2848] Time is precious.
[time=2850] There is so much at stake." And the text says, "And the time has passed."
[time=2858] Back then, some of you might be sitting here in the room going, "Well, gee, I never really had that time in my life.
[time=2865] I never got a chance to go down all those roads.
[time=2869] You didn't miss a thing.
[time=2876] All you missed was the brokenness, the emptiness, the loneliness, the guilt, the shame of life and sin.
[time=2885] And praise God you didn't have to go down that road.
[time=2888] Others of you in the room, you did.
[time=2890] And he says, "The time has passed." There's too much at stake.
[time=2898] There's life to be lived.
[time=2900] There's a battle.
[time=2901] We got to give ourselves to here.
[time=2903] The time has passed.
[time=2905] And that word there, "past" in the Greek, refers to a life of unbelief.
[time=2909] And these people realized, as you and I realized, what it was like to be redeemed.
[time=2914] Now, I want to say this to you, and I hope it's okay that I say this to you.
[time=2919] I've always shot straight with you.
[time=2921] I've always tried my best to just be honest in the living out of this life of mine, along with you.
[time=2928] And I believe hear me.
[time=2929] I believe fully.
[time=2931] And I am absolutely confident that when I got saved, when you came to faith, that he changed your desires.
[time=2938] I believe that that happened at that point in time.
[time=2941] I need you to know, though, that I think it's very important.
[time=2944] I do this daily.
[time=2948] I still am finding myself begging God to change my desires.
[time=2955] He changed them.
[time=2961] And he continues to change them.
[time=2963] But do not think for a moment that what he did at that point of salvation, now, somehow, some way, leaves you and I immune to the battle for our desires.
[time=2977] You with me?
[time=2979] I ask him every day to take ugly, sinful, destructive desires
[time=2990] away from me.
[time=2992] And I pray, and I hope, that you would as well.
[time=2998] Because you know what I believe with all my heart?
[time=2999] He does.
[time=3001] In a miraculous, unbelievable way, he continues to change our desires.
[time=3006] He continues to, if you are willing, and if I'm willing, he aligns our desires with his will, point number two.
[time=3014] But you better be careful.
[time=3018] We better be really, really careful.
[time=3021] We better be grateful for what he did at salvation, and we better ask him every single day to keep transforming our desires.
[time=3031] How are your desires today?
[time=3033] What do you find yourself longing for?
[time=3034] You know what?
[time=3035] There is an onslaught of messages.
[time=3037] There is an absolute truckload of stuff that comes your way in mind every day.
[time=3043] And it's one aim and purpose.
[time=3044] It's to grab hold of your desires.
[time=3048] And I feel like today we should just at this point here, just pray for that.
[time=3051] I'm going to ask Corbin if he'd come up.
[time=3054] And I'm going to ask Corbin to play.
[time=3055] And I'm going to ask you if you would to just bow your heads.
[time=3058] Would you enclose your eyes, right where you're at?
[time=3061] I know many of you.
[time=3063] And I am so grateful for the relationship that God has given us.
[time=3066] I'm so thankful for the honesty and authenticity with which you carry yourself with me and others.
[time=3072] I know there are many in the room today.
[time=3077] I'm the battle for your desires, this fight that the enemy brings.
[time=3083] I know it rages in your heart and soul.
[time=3087] And I know that you would desire, like I would, to be a people who would desire and long for that which is good and right and true.
[time=3095] We don't want to be diminished.
[time=3097] We don't want to be destroyed.
[time=3098] We don't want to be ruined.
[time=3101] And so we come this morning before God.
[time=3102] And we say, oh, God, please keep changing that which we long for.
[time=3108] And if I could, if you would just give me the privilege of praying for you and if you would pray for me
[time=3117] in the days to come.
[time=3119] And let's just pray this, Father, God in heaven, we are so moved as we read the Psalms.
[time=3126] And as we hear David's heart for you, as we read about his longing for you, his desire to be with you, his gratitude for the relationship that he had with you, the fact that he desired nothing else on earth but you.
[time=3145] And God, we would at the same time admit and recognize how short we fall in that endeavor.
[time=3153] And would pray again and ask again today, God, that you would remove evil desires.
[time=3160] God, that not only would you remove them, but that you would expose them for what they are, empty and futile, desires God that lead to death and shame and ruin.
[time=3172] And oh, God, restore in us the joy of our salvation.
[time=3176] Renew a right spirit.
[time=3178] God, and give us perspective that would allow us to go to work, that would allow us to be with friends, that would allow us to be in the marketplace.
[time=3186] God, it would allow us to go in and through this life with our eyes fixed on that which is true and right and good.
[time=3196] Oh, God, change our wants.
[time=3200] Keep molding and shaping our desires and know how grateful we are for you.
[time=3206] God, as Corbin sings, I pray that our hearts would be encouraged.
[time=3212] I pray that our hearts would be reminded of a life completely and absolutely surrendered to you.
[time=3219] And your son's name, I pray. Amen.
[time=3223] [MUSIC - 259 seconds]
[time=3487] [AMEN]
[time=3498] Would you stand with me?
[time=3501] Would you bow your heads?
[time=3503] And as we go, may this be our prayer.
[time=3506] God, we pray that you would and only the way that you can, God, that you would give us the strength and courage to give you our all.
[time=3517] God, to lay it all on the line, completely and absolutely.
[time=3522] And we thank you, God, as a people today for your willingness to stand by us as we do so.
[time=3526] God, to help us in the fight.
[time=3528] God, to give us the weapons needed to endure and to persevere, to keep taking that walk, a walk that leads to glory.
[time=3538] God, a walk that leads to honoring you.
[time=3541] A walk that leads to life, not death.
[time=3545] Thank you.
[time=3546] This is very much for your life-changing, life-giving word.
[time=3551] I pray, God, that as we leave, you would keep us safe, bring us back together again soon, if that would be your will.
[time=3558] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3568] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
