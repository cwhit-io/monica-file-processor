[time=578] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor
[time=587] here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I am so excited to be able to share with you this opportunity that we've got for you, those of you in our Bible Hour audience.
[time=597] I believe last week Steve Longbrake shared something about this, but I have been itching to get here and to share this with you, and you're gonna hear me share it with you again and again in the next several weeks.
[time=608] We are so looking forward to September 9th.
[time=612] I want you to just get out of pen, I want you to get out a piece of paper and write this down, September 9th.
[time=618] At the Grand Wayne Center, from seven to nine, we are putting together a night that we are calling an evening with Black Hawk.
[time=626] And here's the deal.
[time=628] Every year we do this, we've just always done it on site.
[time=632] This year we're gonna do it off site.
[time=633] It's a night that we come together as a family and we celebrate what God has done in the last year or so of ministry.
[time=641] And not only do we celebrate what he has done, but we look forward to the next ministry year and what we believe and hope he's gonna do.
[time=649] And we have all of our team and we have a couple, two, 300 folks from our kind of our core ministry family.
[time=656] And it's just been a great, great night.
[time=658] We've always called it Vision Night.
[time=660] Well, this year's Vision Night, it got a little bit bigger in our minds and in our hearts.
[time=666] And here's what we've decided.
[time=668] We wanna invite our entire church, which we're gonna do.
[time=671] And we wanna have all of our volunteers and all of our core ministry team there and they'll be there, but we want you to come.
[time=678] It is gonna be a phenomenal night.
[time=679] Corbin and the worship team, they're gonna be there.
[time=683] We're gonna be down at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=685] We're gonna fill one of those rooms.
[time=686] We're gonna celebrate what God has done, share stories of life change and transformation.
[time=692] And we're really excited about a special speaker we're gonna bring in.
[time=696] His name is Pastor Bill Hybels.
[time=699] Bill Hybels is the senior and founding pastor at Willow Creek Community Church.
[time=703] Bill has been a huge encouragement.
[time=706] Willow Creek has been a huge encouragement to thousands, thousands of churches here in the States and across the world.
[time=713] And Bill has a huge passion for the local church.
[time=716] And he has not only influenced me personally, but Bill and his team and the whole Willow Creek Association has been a constant reminder to us of what a prevailing church looks like, what a prevailing God honoring ministry can be like.
[time=732] And we are so thankful for him and for his team.
[time=735] And he's gonna come that night and be with us.
[time=737] I'll be there and we want you to come.
[time=741] So many times we think about you.
[time=744] So many times we have considered you as part of our family and yet so many times we don't actually get to be together.
[time=750] So what we've done is this.
[time=752] We've set up on our website a way that you can reserve seats, whether you have a church home or not.
[time=758] I mean, this is a freebie.
[time=760] You can come, we're not gonna recruit you.
[time=762] We just wanna give you the chance to be with us.
[time=765] We wanna be in that setting, worshiping God and celebrating what God has done together.
[time=770] So you go to our website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=774] You click on the link that says an evening with Blackhawk.
[time=778] And there you can reserve your seats.
[time=780] We're making this a night for kind of those 18 years and older.
[time=784] You come, bring your family, bring your friends, bring folks from your small group.
[time=789] And again, especially if you don't have a home church, this is your chance to kind of in a pretty neutral setting, come and have a great, great time.
[time=797] And I wanna make sure that we get the chance, you and I, to meet that night.
[time=801] We'd love to meet you.
[time=802] We'd love to get to know you better.
[time=804] And we'd love for you to come and celebrate with us.
[time=806] An evening with Blackhawk.
[time=808] September 9th, 7 to 9 p.m. at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=812] Get on the website or call our church office.
[time=815] If you call 493 7400, 493 7400.
[time=820] And if you hit extension 450, 450, you can get some seats that way as well.
[time=827] I hope you'll take us up on it.
[time=828] We would love to have you there.
[time=830] Thank you so much for tuning into the broadcast.
[time=833] Thanks for being a part of the family.
[time=835] We hope to see you soon.
[time=836] - Before Kelly comes back to lead us in worship through the teaching of the word, I just wanted to give everyone in the room an opportunity to kind of quiet your hearts and prepare your mind and your ears to hear and your eyes to see what God has for you to learn today.
[time=855] Kelly opens first Peter again to teach us.
[time=858] So we're going to sing this and you can sing with me or you can just be still and quiet your heart to prepare yourself for the teaching of the word.
[time=868] (gentle music)
[time=881] [MUSIC - 69 seconds]
[time=965] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 75 seconds]
[time=1050] (gentle music) - Would you stand with me in honor of those ancient words?
[time=1055] As we come back to our study this morning in the book of 1 Peter, please join me in 1 Peter chapter four, verses seven through 11 and allow me the privilege if you would of reading this for you today.
[time=1068] God writes through the hand of Peter, in 1 Peter 4, seven, the end of all things is near.
[time=1078] Therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer.
[time=1086] Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another because love covers a multitude of sins.
[time=1094] Be hospitable to one another without complaint.
[time=1097] As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
[time=1106] Whoever speaks is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God.
[time=1112] Whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies.
[time=1119] So that in all things, all of that, so that in all things,
[time=1129] God may be what?
[time=1131] Glorified, through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever and they all agreed and said, oh God, we come before you again today so very grateful for the privilege of doing so.
[time=1149] So thankful that we, being who we are, can come before you.
[time=1155] And God, as we do so, we pray that these ancient words that are ever true will continue to change us.
[time=1163] Many in the room this morning, God, we need to be changed.
[time=1167] We need to be further transformed, God, we need to be more and more of who you called us to be.
[time=1174] And we pray, God, that today your spirit and your word would do that very work in us.
[time=1178] We ask it gratefully, God, we ask it humbly and we ask it this morning expectantly in your son's precious name, amen.
[time=1190] You can be seated.
[time=1193] Well, as we start out this morning in our passage and as you read those first few words, the end of all things is near.
[time=1202] Boy, my mind goes a lot of different directions.
[time=1205] There's a lot of places we can go with this initial thought, a lot of pictures I think that can be painted, there's something about time running out.
[time=1215] It's very captivating, it's very compelling.
[time=1221] One of the first places I go in my mind is just the years I spent, the privilege I had of playing basketball, I just played ball all through school once Mark Menendez let me play, right?
[time=1233] Then I played and then all through junior high and high school even got to play in college and I can just remember, I mean, I can remember going to games, but I can remember being at games, in games with 13 seconds left.
[time=1245] I remember that feeling.
[time=1248] Maybe you can identify, you know, I remember the feeling of 39 minutes having gone by and here we are in the last 13 seconds and now we're gonna see who's gonna bring what.
[time=1259] I can think back on the last 45 years or so
[time=1265] of watching my son golf and his buddy's golf and becoming more and more, I used to play a lot of golf.
[time=1271] Now I caddy and walk courses for a living.
[time=1274] It's an amazing thing to watch golf and as the guys get older and as the competition gets stiffer and whether it's out on a junior golf tournament tour or whether it's watching on a Sunday afternoon, there's something I've learned, there's something about the last, something about a one shot lead with three holes to play.
[time=1292] It's just, it's compelling.
[time=1296] It's just so amazing to see how the individual is going to respond with time running out and the pack making a charge and who you gonna be?
[time=1306] What are you gonna do?
[time=1308] How will you respond?
[time=1309] I think about the game I've played, maybe you haven't but I've played it at parties.
[time=1315] People do it often times.
[time=1317] You're trying to get to know each other or you're trying to just kind of do a conversation starter.
[time=1322] Your house is burning down and you have the chance to go in and get five things.
[time=1328] If your home was on fire, what would you go in and get, right?
[time=1333] Well, it's a great conversation starter but you know what, it's also a very clear, it's a value, passion, priority, clarifier.
[time=1345] There's something about what we do in the end
[time=1351] with time running out and the clock ticking.
[time=1353] There's something about that that Peter lays hold of here in our passage and he says to you and I, "Hey, my friends, the end is near." And you may not have a whole lot of time.
[time=1366] So with the time you've been given, be this.
[time=1371] It's such a great passage today.
[time=1372] I love it when it's so simple and clear.
[time=1375] This is not gonna be a complicated 30 minutes, my friends.
[time=1378] And one thing before we get into it, on the end of all things being near, as I read this week and as I look through this, I realize that there's a couple of different ways you can look at this.
[time=1391] Some will look at this passage and say that he's saying, the end of all things is near, the end of time.
[time=1397] The end of time, as you know it, the eminent return of Christ is coming.
[time=1403] This world as we know it is coming to an end and it's coming to an end quickly.
[time=1410] So you better be ready, end of all things, end of time.
[time=1413] You and I know that the second coming of Christ could happen today.
[time=1417] You realize that.
[time=1421] His return could take place this week.
[time=1423] All of this could be over.
[time=1425] But the more I thought about it and the more I kind of looked it over, the more I realized, you know what?
[time=1431] At the same time, you and I could live and die of old age.
[time=1435] Right?
[time=1437] For some of you, that would be quicker than for others, of us, but either way, we could all live a really, really, really long life.
[time=1446] But in the scope of things, whether he comes tomorrow and this is over or you live to be 97 in the scope of things, the end of all things is what, near.
[time=1464] Your 97 years is just, boom, it's just a blip on the screen.
[time=1470] So either way you look at it, my friends, time is running out.
[time=1476] So he says, be this.
[time=1478] It reminds me of Romans.
[time=1480] Can we just look there real quick before we jump into our text?
[time=1483] It reminds me of what it says in Romans 13.
[time=1485] Turn there if you would.
[time=1487] Romans 13, verse 11.
[time=1489] Paul speaks to this very issue.
[time=1492] He brings to our attention this very mindset, Romans 13, verse 11.
[time=1496] He says this, do this, do this, knowing the time that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep.
[time=1505] For now, salvation, salvation here in this context, meaning your and I's final glorification, our being with the Father.
[time=1513] Salvation is nearer to us than when we believed.
[time=1517] The night is almost gone and the day is near.
[time=1520] Therefore, time is running out.
[time=1523] The day is near.
[time=1524] Therefore, let us what?
[time=1526] Let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
[time=1530] There's a lot at stake, people.
[time=1535] Time is running out.
[time=1537] Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy.
[time=1550] And don't forget there, just a reminder, it'll side.
[time=1555] Don't forget jealousy and drunkenness.
[time=1559] Paul in the same verse.
[time=1566] Strife and sexual promiscuity, all just as ugly.
[time=1571] He says, put that aside and put on verse 14, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.
[time=1583] The end of time is near.
[time=1587] Time is running out, my friends.
[time=1589] How will you respond?
[time=1592] How will we live?
[time=1593] Well, Peter says, here's four things.
[time=1597] I want you to keep in mind.
[time=1598] And I hope this morning as we go through this, that you'll take note of it.
[time=1602] I hope that somehow, as we make our way through this, that you will be taught something new, encouraged, reminded of something maybe you've forgotten, but here we go.
[time=1610] With time running out, we must be sound.
[time=1615] We must be sound in our judgment, write that down.
[time=1618] You see it right there in verse Peter 4, verse 7.
[time=1621] The end of all things is near, therefore, be of sound judgment.
[time=1626] We'll stop right there.
[time=1627] What does it mean for you and I too?
[time=1630] With time running out, with the clock ticking, with the end of all things near.
[time=1634] He says, okay, okay, here you go.
[time=1636] Listen, number one, be of sound judgment.
[time=1639] Means this, it means to be in one's right mind.
[time=1646] To be in one's right mind, it means to have a heart, a soul, a mind fixed on what is true.
[time=1654] It means to be dialed in and locked on that, which is good and right and true.
[time=1660] And what is most true of all?
[time=1663] What, God's word?
[time=1665] Don't deviate from, don't walk away from.
[time=1669] Don't lose your focus on, no, it means to be sound, to be clear, to be focused, to be dialed in.
[time=1677] And you know, it's so amazing that he writes it this way, that he uses this phrase because you know, and I know from our study of this book that these folks found themselves in a culture, in a day where culture and the voice of society was trying to move them in the absolute opposite direction of sound thinking.
[time=1700] Truth is you and I, right?
[time=1704] Truth is you and I live in a culture.
[time=1706] We live in a world system that wants to see us out of control.
[time=1713] You see, the enemy would rather see you and I be absolutely over the edge, over the top, not sound, not dialed in, not fixed, but just scattered all over the place.
[time=1724] He wants to see you and I out of control financially, out of control sexually, out of control emotionally, relationally, God's word says there is a lot at stake, my friends, the time is running out.
[time=1742] I need you to be, I want you to be, I am calling you to be clear.
[time=1747] I don't know about you, it's why I like,
[time=1753] some of you like the challenge.
[time=1756] I don't like the challenge of this.
[time=1757] I want, when you give me directions to go somewhere, I would like you to just go ahead and be really, really, what, clear.
[time=1766] Tell me how many stop signs, tell me how many blocks, tell me everything you can tell me so I can just, so I can just read the paper and drive and get there.
[time=1777] I don't have to wonder about what that, where that road might have gone or maybe think, you know, maybe I should, I wonder if they meant, just tell me where to go.
[time=1789] Be clear so I can get there.
[time=1792] Let me be fixed.
[time=1795] Proverbs 4.23 uses that very same word in the Hebrew.
[time=1802] It says in Proverbs 4.23, I think you can see it there on your screen.
[time=1808] Says watch over your heart with all diligence.
[time=1814] Watch over your heart that word there has to do with the central point of thought and decision making.
[time=1823] It is the grid, the heart, the mind, the will.
[time=1825] Watch over your heart with all diligence.
[time=1829] We've looked at that word diligence in the past.
[time=1831] It has to do with an effort that would bring you to the point of physical exhaustion.
[time=1835] You would guard it that tightly.
[time=1837] You would watch over it.
[time=1839] With that kind of discipline and that kind of effort,
[time=1845] watch over your heart with all diligence.
[time=1849] Be careful what you allow in.
[time=1851] Be careful with what's observed.
[time=1853] Be careful with what's watched.
[time=1856] Be careful with what's listened to guard the heart.
[time=1861] With all diligence for from it flow the springs of life.
[time=1865] Put away from you a deceitful mouth and put devious speech far from you.
[time=1871] Let you watch this.
[time=1872] Let your eyes look directly ahead.
[time=1875] Remember the fish in James one in our discussion about lust and temptation?
[time=1882] Remember the lure, remember that?
[time=1884] Remember the fish that just needed to keep its eyes forward and swim where it was supposed to go and not be worried about the shiny lure that offered so much satisfaction and gratification.
[time=1898] Let verse 25, let your eyes look directly ahead and let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you.
[time=1908] Watch the path of your feet and all your ways will be established.
[time=1913] Do not turn to the right nor to the left.
[time=1917] Turn your foot from evil.
[time=1919] All of that describing a sound, a sound mind, a sound heart focused, fixed, dialed in on that which is true.
[time=1934] Keeping our minds clear.
[time=1935] I can't tell you how many times I've sat in my office with dear people who I love and care for.
[time=1943] Maybe it's been in a restaurant booth somewhere.
[time=1945] Maybe it's even been through an email but I can't tell you how many times I've sat and listened to folks describe their brokenness.
[time=1952] How many times I've sat there and listened to them tell their story of sin and all of its unfolding consequences.
[time=1963] I can't tell you how many times I've sat there and watched a just destroyed, distraught individual say to me something like this, how did I get here?
[time=1976] How did this happen?
[time=1981] And the more conversation we have and the more we go down that road and begin to kind of unpack all that has transpired and inevitably it comes back to a mind, a heart that didn't stay fixed.
[time=2001] It turned a little here, a little there,
[time=2007] a little right, a little left, a little lure action over here and all of a sudden it gets really, really muddy.
[time=2013] Be of sound judgment, he says.
[time=2020] Keep it clear.
[time=2022] I have good friends who will say to me periodically,
[time=2029] you need to pull your head out.
[time=2032] You, vernacular for today, which basically means you need to get clear, my friend.
[time=2039] Somehow, some way it's gotten muddy.
[time=2042] Somehow, some way the things you're saying, the things you're doing, it's not good.
[time=2049] They say to me, get your head clear in essence.
[time=2054] Wake up.
[time=2055] Be sound.
[time=2058] The heart and mind of the Christ follower must be set and fixed on spiritual priorities.
[time=2066] How are yours?
[time=2069] How are your spiritual priorities today?
[time=2072] How's it going at home?
[time=2074] How's it going with your family?
[time=2075] How's it going with your wife or your husband?
[time=2078] How's it going with your time with God?
[time=2080] How is it going?
[time=2082] In the arena of those things in your life that you and I know we both desperately need, how are the spiritual disciplines of your life, the spiritual priorities?
[time=2092] How do they flesh themselves out these days for you?
[time=2096] We must be set and fixed on spiritual priorities,
[time=2102] holy living, God honoring choices.
[time=2105] 'Cause if we're not, if the gaze goes right or left, then all of a sudden the priorities are fleshly, not spiritual, the living is sinful, not holy.
[time=2118] The choices are self-serving, not God honoring.
[time=2122] And he says, no, no, my friends, the time is running out, there is so much at stake.
[time=2128] Be sound.
[time=2131] Secondly, write this down, he says, be sober.
[time=2134] We must be with the game winding down, with so much at stake.
[time=2142] We must be, back to first Peter 4, we must be sober in spirit.
[time=2149] You see it there?
[time=2150] The end of all things is near, therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit.
[time=2157] I want you to stop right there.
[time=2159] Spiritually, listen, spiritually, he says, you have got to be sober.
[time=2167] What does it mean to be spiritually sober?
[time=2172] Well, maybe I'll just illustrate it for you, okay?
[time=2176] All right, now watch.
[time=2180] If you were watching, like watch, like they were, watch.
[time=2186] If you were watching, like they were, I threw that thing pretty hard.
[time=2193] I don't think I hurt anybody, did I?
[time=2195] Okay, nobody got hurt because they were what?
[time=2198] They were what?
[time=2201] They were watching.
[time=2202] And I threw that thing pretty hard, and I can throw these things pretty hard, I can throw them up there, and I can throw them over there.
[time=2209] Now the whole room's going, man, he's lost his mind.
[time=2212] Oh, I'm back there.
[time=2214] Now you know what?
[time=2218] Every single person in this room is awake.
[time=2223] The few that we're dosing are not.
[time=2228] And you're thinking, man, he was throwing those with a little bit of punch, he had a little bit of energy.
[time=2236] Well, guess what?
[time=2238] If you don't wake up,
[time=2246] if you don't stay alert, if you don't keep your gaze fixed and your mind clear,
[time=2255] he will clean your clock.
[time=2258] One of those balls will come, and you will have been dosing, and it'll knock your head off.
[time=2268] It'll ruin your life, take away everything you know and love and hold to be dear because that's what he wants.
[time=2277] He wants to ruin you.
[time=2278] And God knows that.
[time=2281] God's word says to you and I this morning, "Hey, wake up, don't you dare not off." You can not off in here.
[time=2291] Don't not off out there.
[time=2293] No, be sober.
[time=2296] Don't be drunk.
[time=2298] I mean, he uses the phrase and he uses the word there.
[time=2302] He uses this picture of not being drunk.
[time=2305] Somebody asked me once, what does being sober really mean?
[time=2309] I meant it means not being really drunk.
[time=2312] It means not being intoxicated.
[time=2314] It means not being in a state whereby you are not in control of or aware of your own faculties and your own thinking, it just means a clear picture.
[time=2325] And yes, we can talk about it with reference to alcohol, but here spiritually it has a much broader reference.
[time=2333] Be alert.
[time=2337] Look around every bush, look under every rock.
[time=2344] You can't let it sneak up on you.
[time=2347] Be awake.
[time=2349] I wonder, just a question for you.
[time=2354] I wonder if in the next seven days, you'll ever turn on the television and see Lance Armstrong over this next week, I'm just wondering if you'll see Lance in the starting gate, in the starting block where they start each race, wonder if this week, if you'll ever see him yawning.
[time=2378] Anybody, what do you think?
[time=2383] Yeah, no, no.
[time=2385] Why?
[time=2386] Well, 'cause there's so much at stake.
[time=2388] And he's worked so hard and he's trained so long
[time=2394] and there's so much prestige and there's so much honor and there's so much at stake here.
[time=2401] I mean, it's the tour de France.
[time=2403] And you can bet he won't be yawning.
[time=2409] No, his gaze will be fixed and I'm simply suggesting to you today that you and I have a whole lot more at stake than champagne in Paris on Sunday with a couple of girls kissing them on the cheek.
[time=2424] So much bigger.
[time=2427] It's so much more important.
[time=2428] And the only way we're gonna finish is to be sound in our judgment, in our minds and sober, clear, alert in our spirit.
[time=2440] Number three says this.
[time=2446] Look at verse eight, this is amazing.
[time=2449] Look at the first two words of verse eight.
[time=2451] He says above all, above all.
[time=2455] You know what that means?
[time=2456] Here's what this means.
[time=2458] I mean, think this through with me.
[time=2459] Have the first two, I don't know what kind of job I've done communicating it, but have the first two points today seemed relevant to you, yes or no.
[time=2468] Have the first two points today as you thought it through, have they seemed important to you?
[time=2474] I mean, have you think through these first two things, being sound in our minds and being sober in spirit?
[time=2480] I mean, do you get a sense in your own life as you think about this?
[time=2483] Like for me, as I thought about these first two points, like, wow, that's really, really good stuff.
[time=2490] Yeah, me too.
[time=2492] Now he says above all.
[time=2496] In the Greek, when I looked at that, it's basically him saying, hey, you thought those two were important.
[time=2503] Hey, it's, hey, look at this, above all.
[time=2508] Even above the first two things I've said, keep fervent in your love for one another because love covers a multitude of sins.
[time=2521] He brings enormous importance to this phrase.
[time=2527] He says, in essence, above all, in essence, this is paramount.
[time=2532] Church, Christ follower, you have got to see this.
[time=2537] And what he says basically is this, if the end, if this is the end, and it is.
[time=2545] If this is our final push, I mean, if these are the last days, and if the church, if we are going to, as the church, change, reach, and change the world, which last I checked is what he called you and I to do.
[time=2561] To reach and change by his grace and through his strength for his great glory.
[time=2568] He has left us here to do one thing, and that is to fulfill the great commission and live out the great commandment.
[time=2574] And if you and I are going to, with the clock running out, reach and change by God's grace and through his strength, the world, the world, the globe, and your world.
[time=2587] Where you live, the people you get to reach, if you and I are going to do that effectively, he says, guess what, you're gonna have to do that together.
[time=2597] You're gonna have to do it warmly.
[time=2604] You're gonna have to do that with a great, great love for each other.
[time=2609] Fervantly, he says, for each other, not against each other, not critical of each other, not undermining each other, no.
[time=2617] Sacrificially agape, love, agape, sacrificially for each other.
[time=2627] Interesting word, the word fervent in the Greek
[time=2634] when you look at this, denotes the word fervent in the Greek, it denotes an athlete.
[time=2640] It paints a picture of an athlete running, stretching.
[time=2643] It's that 100-yard dash, dude, or gal at the end and they're making that stretch, right?
[time=2651] And you see the leg muscles are just taut and the veins are popping out on the neck and they're running as fast and stretching as far and flexing as much as they can.
[time=2664] Putting forth maximum physical, emotional effort.
[time=2669] You see that picture, he says, he connects that picture to your love for me and my love for you.
[time=2679] And I think, at least I know, I don't know about you,
[time=2686] but I think I know why he did that because I know how hard I am to love.
[time=2700] I know how hard he is, that guy sitting next to you today or maybe he's not sitting next to you today.
[time=2706] That woman sitting next to you, that family, four rows down and over to the left, I know.
[time=2713] Have we all figured it out yet?
[time=2716] We're all pretty hard to love.
[time=2719] And here, name, man, we've all got issues, we've all got struggles, we've all got things about us that make us difficult to love.
[time=2726] He in essence says, hey, you know what, get over it.
[time=2729] There's so much at stake here.
[time=2733] The clock is running down.
[time=2735] You've only got a couple holes left.
[time=2737] And if you're gonna make a difference in this world, see, here's the deal.
[time=2742] See, the world, anybody over here far from God, anybody over here living life today outside of a relationship with God, they're not stupid, they're not dumb, they know what's going on.
[time=2754] They see what life is about.
[time=2757] And they know that life is about me taking care of me.
[time=2761] They know that the system they live in is all about me, it's all about my satisfaction, it's all about my agenda.
[time=2768] And these people living life far from God outside of relationship with God, when they see, when they come up against, when they bump into a band of Christ followers that live life with a motto, that live life with a commitment, that live life truly and really radically in love with God and each other.
[time=2792] When acts of sacrificial service and kindness and love are everyday things, when giving and listening and serving and comforting and encouraging flow from their hearts and lives, you've got somebody over here far from God who bumps up against that and goes, okay, wait a second.
[time=2813] See, I believe that right there, a fervent love
[time=2819] for each other has an enormous capacity to impact another and draw them and for God to use, I believe God uses his word to penetrate and impact the hearts of people far from him.
[time=2834] I believe God uses the love of Christ followers to do the very same thing.
[time=2841] So you know what bottom line is, I know I'm hard to love.
[time=2846] If you're honest, you know you know you are.
[time=2852] And whether it's marriage, whether it's family, whether it's church body, we have got to be willing to stretch and strain and flex and reach and do whatever we've got to do to embrace
[time=2872] the unlovely, the difficult, the challenging and the hard to be with, you and me and fervently love.
[time=2880] Lastly, call me at this, don't miss this,
[time=2891] under love, under being loving.
[time=2894] With time running out, we must be loving.
[time=2898] Under that, let me just draw your attention.
[time=2900] He actually gives us a little application, lots of applications for that.
[time=2904] He gives you one right here.
[time=2906] It says there as verse nine, be hospitable.
[time=2912] There you go, write that down.
[time=2914] Under loving, he gives one example, one way you and I can do this.
[time=2917] You know what it is?
[time=2918] It's hospitable to one another without complaint.
[time=2923] It's a real basic concept, my friends.
[time=2928] Open your home, make a meal, take dessert over, find the weary traveler, find the struggling individual,
[time=2943] open your eyes, open your heart, open your home, open your gifts, take them in, care for them for an hour or two or three or maybe it's a week, I don't know, but do it.
[time=2958] Be hospitable and it says do it without complaint.
[time=2962] Be willing and grateful to open up what you can open up.
[time=2966] Don't worry about your house and don't worry about what they'll think, just love them.
[time=2973] Welcome them in.
[time=2975] Lastly, we must serve.
[time=2977] We must be with time running out.
[time=2978] We must be, you and I, my friends, must be servants.
[time=2982] I told you it was a basic text, right?
[time=2984] Look how it unfolds with time running out.
[time=2986] We must be sound, sober, loving servants.
[time=2990] It's right there and we could take weeks.
[time=2996] I mean, we could take verses 10 and 11 and I'm telling you we could stretch first Peter to Christmas, we won't, calm down,
[time=3006] but I wanna read this to you.
[time=3007] This is just rich with great, great truth.
[time=3010] As each one, look at verse 10.
[time=3013] As each one has received a special gift.
[time=3017] Question for you today, who has been given a special spiritual gift?
[time=3024] Who got the, who gets the spiritual gifts?
[time=3026] Who?
[time=3027] Everybody, who, everybody who knows who?
[time=3031] Everybody who knows the Lord.
[time=3033] Everybody who comes into a life-saving relationship with Christ.
[time=3037] Everybody who fully surrenders their heart and life to him.
[time=3041] God's word says, gets, receives, a spiritual gift, a divine gift specifically and uniquely designed by God in order to give it to you so that you would employ it
[time=3057] so that you would use it.
[time=3058] You got one, probably two or three.
[time=3062] I got a couple.
[time=3063] We've been given by God a special divine gift meant to be used so the body of Christ could be built up, so having been built up the body of Christ could be effective and a world far from God could be reached through the one agent, the one tool God chose to reach a lost and dying world, the church.
[time=3091] As each one has received a special gift, employ it, use it, serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
[time=3101] Here's where it always gets a little dicey for me, I know.
[time=3106] First Peter 4.11, my wife and kids gave me this Bible
[time=3112] a few years ago, presented to Kelly by Deborah and the kids.
[time=3121] Preach the word, Dad.
[time=3123] March 10th, 2002.
[time=3129] And on the cover, inscribed is first Peter 4.11.
[time=3135] Whoever speaks is to do so as one who is speaking
[time=3143] the utterances of God.
[time=3148] I gotta tell you, sometimes when I read that I just about come undone.
[time=3154] Sometimes when I read that, you know, I didn't ask for the gift that he gave, you didn't ask for your gift, I didn't ask for mine, he just gave it to us and he said, use it, so I try.
[time=3167] I read that sometimes and just think, you know what, I need to sit down.
[time=3170] Are you kidding me, the utterances of God?
[time=3179] And then I realized, you know what, it's not just those who speak.
[time=3184] I don't know if you realize this, this may be a new learning for some of you, but all the spiritual gifts basically by and large are found in Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and Ephesians 4.
[time=3199] And when you take all of those gifts, if you were to put them all on a sheet of paper, they basically come down to two different sections, two different columns, if you will, of gifts.
[time=3214] And guess what the two columns are?
[time=3217] There are speaking gifts and there are serving gifts.
[time=3222] And look at 1 Peter 4.11, so awesome.
[time=3227] Whoever speaks is to do so, as one who is speaking the utterance of God.
[time=3233] Whoever serves is to do so, as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies, so that in all things, God may be glorified.
[time=3246] That's the end result.
[time=3249] He is glorified.
[time=3251] He is lifted up.
[time=3253] People far from God get a glimpse of the church, the bride of Christ, they begin to see life in a different way.
[time=3261] They hear people speaking, as if it were the very utterance of God.
[time=3265] They see people serving with the strength that only God supplies.
[time=3269] They see sound, sober, loving servants.
[time=3276] And God has lifted up.
[time=3281] Ministry takes place.
[time=3285] You and I, we get changed and transformed and people far from God come to faith.
[time=3292] And he says to you and I this morning, my friends, the time is running out.
[time=3299] We need a good shot.
[time=3302] We need to step up, be who God's called us to be.
[time=3308] And I pray and I hope this morning that you would join me in that effort.
[time=3314] I needed to hear this today.
[time=3317] I really did.
[time=3318] I need to in my own life continue to work at these four things and I would invite you to join me in that endeavor.
[time=3328] I believe, if you will, I believe that we can together be the church that God's called us to be with so much at stake, with so much on the line.
[time=3338] I hope you'll join me.
[time=3340] Would you stand this morning and let's close in a word of prayer?
[time=3344] Let me just ask if you would to bow your heads and close your eyes and let me just say this to you before we pray and go.
[time=3354] There may be some in the room this morning and you may have been here with us now for a few weeks, a few months.
[time=3360] Maybe it's been over a year or so.
[time=3363] But you may be here this morning and truth be told between you and God, you know that you have not yet surrendered, really given him your heart and your life.
[time=3375] And truth be told, you sit here this morning and as you listen to the word of God, as you hear these ancient words explained, as you see this morning and as you sense what he wants from us, there is so much inside you that resonates with truth.
[time=3393] And yet you need to be reminded that this life, this kind of living for you is impossible.
[time=3401] It's impossible for anybody.
[time=3403] There will be no sound, sober, loving, serving, living without the power of Christ in you.
[time=3410] And so this morning, maybe you would just wanna make that commitment, maybe in the privacy and the quietness of your own heart.
[time=3418] You would want to just before God say these words quietly and privately.
[time=3423] Dear God, I know I have seen and have realized that I am a sinner, I am separated from you.
[time=3437] By my sin.
[time=3438] And God, I am so grateful because I have learned that your son died for my sin.
[time=3445] God, your son died so I could be forgiven.
[time=3449] And this morning, right here in the quietness of my heart before you, God, I accept that forgiveness and I offer you my life, all of it.
[time=3459] God, I fully surrender my heart and life to you.
[time=3463] And I pray, God, that you would grow me.
[time=3466] I pray, God, that you would help me know what it means to be a follower of Christ.
[time=3471] I commit, God, to share this decision with close and trusted friends.
[time=3478] I commit, God, to be a part of this local family.
[time=3482] And I thank you, God, for saving me.
[time=3486] I know, God, for others of us in the room who know you,
[time=3492] just the thought of one person praying that prayer to you today, God, it ignites our hearts again with great hope and encouragement.
[time=3502] Thank you, God, for entrusting such a mission to the likes of us.
[time=3508] And we commit again, God, to be your people.
[time=3511] Sound, sober, loving, and serving.
[time=3514] Willing to do whatever we might need to do and go, wherever we might need to go.
[time=3520] To help seeking people find and follow Christ.
[time=3523] God, we love you and we thank you for this time.
[time=3527] God, be with us as we go.
[time=3530] And all the people were thankful and said amen.
[time=3533] (upbeat music)
