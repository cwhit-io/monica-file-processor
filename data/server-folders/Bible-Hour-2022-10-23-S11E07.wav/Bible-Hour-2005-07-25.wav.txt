[time=30] Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=57] and on earth.
[time=63] Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=69] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=79] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=85] end of the age.
[time=90] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=100] I will bless the Lord forever, and I will trust him at all times.
[time=126] He has delivered me from all fear, he has said my feet upon a rock.
[time=154] I will not be moved, and I'll say of the Lord, you are my dear, my strength, my portion.
[time=172] I will live under my shelter, strong tower, my very present hell, in time of year.
[time=192] Who have I in heaven but you, and there's love I desire beside you.
[time=218] And you have made me glad, and I'll say of the Lord, you are my dear, my strength, my portion.
[time=239] Deliver my shelter, strong tower, my very present hell.
[time=254] You are my chief, my strength, my portion.
[time=265] Deliver my shelter, strong tower, my very present hell, in time of year.
[time=280] I will love you by my portion, my king, you are my fortress, I will never hurt.
[time=308] I will love you, and I'll say of the Lord, you are my shield.
[time=337] My strength, my portion.
[time=343] Deliver my shelter, strong tower, my very present hell.
[time=356] You are my chief, my strength, my portion.
[time=366] Deliver my shelter, strong tower, my very present hell.
[time=379] You are my chief, my strength, my portion.
[time=389] Deliver my shelter, strong tower, my very present hell, in time of year.
[time=409] My very present hell, in time of year.
[time=474] I will love you by my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend.
[time=506] my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend.
[time=531] You are my chief, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend.
[time=568] You are my chief, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my

[time=651] Would you stand together and let's sing one final song?
[time=655] (upbeat music)
[time=680] [MUSIC - 535 seconds]
[time=1216] I just have the privilege of meeting as many of you as I can, and thank you so much for your support of the broadcast. Thank you for being a part of our family, and we can't wait to see you that night, September 9th. God bless and have a great week.
[time=1246] [MUSIC - 69 seconds]
[time=1319] Well, if you'd open your Bibles this morning,
[time=1329] to 1 Peter chapter 4, we will continue this morning in our study.
[time=1334] This is a study that has taken us through this great letter that Peter writes to the Christ followers of this day.
[time=1341] And we find ourselves this morning at chapter 4 verses 7 through 12.
[time=1346] 1 Peter chapter 4 verses 7 to 12.
[time=1349] And I got to ask the question, how are you and I in God's eyes, how are you and I as Christ followers?
[time=1360] It's supposed to suffer.
[time=1364] How are we to suffer?
[time=1368] What should our suffering entail?
[time=1372] What should our approach to suffering be in a fallen and very confusing world full of very fallen people?
[time=1382] When you and I encounter the difficulties and the tragedies and the pain and the sorrows of life, when you and I find ourselves confronted by once again the confusion of suffering and the weight that that brings and all that is entailed there, how should you and I as Christ followers?
[time=1404] How should we suffer?
[time=1407] God's Word today, Peter, as he writes to this amazing band of Christ followers who you know and I know from our study, found themselves right in the midst of suffering.
[time=1418] And it was a scenario.
[time=1420] I learned this week it was a culture there in Rome with Nero that was about to get even hotter.
[time=1427] The suffering was about to get turned up.
[time=1430] It was going to get even more painful.
[time=1433] And so Peter writes and it's a reoccurring theme we've seen before.
[time=1437] He writes and he shares with them and he shares with you and I today how it is we should view how it is we should live in the midst of the inevitable suffering.
[time=1451] In honor of God's Word would you stand this morning and allow me to read to you 1 Peter chapter 4 verses 12 to 19.
[time=1461] It begins like this.
[time=1463] He says, "Beloved." And I'd like you to stop right there.
[time=1470] Can we just stop just for a moment?
[time=1472] I'm sorry.
[time=1473] I've got to say this to you.
[time=1476] Whoever you are, whatever your circumstance might be today,
[time=1482] as I was up here earlier and as we were looking at Psalm 18, whatever difficulty you might be facing, whatever suffering you find yourself today possibly in the midst of.
[time=1493] Whatever it is that has so confused you, whatever relationship has been broken,
[time=1499] whatever circumstance God has allowed that you just don't understand.
[time=1503] And as it builds and builds and as it seems to get a little darker and darker and the winds blow harder, I want you to remember today that he begins this passage with a very important phrase.
[time=1514] He says, "Beloved, divinely loved of God."
[time=1524] And you have to, you need to be.
[time=1527] I want you today to be reminded that he watched the God of this universe,
[time=1536] the creator and sustainer of all, the mighty and majestic one.
[time=1540] God, the God that we just sang about because there is no other God like him.
[time=1546] He is above all.
[time=1548] He is before all.
[time=1550] He is over all.
[time=1552] That God loves who?
[time=1557] You.
[time=1559] Deeply.
[time=1561] Perfectly.
[time=1564] He says, "Hey, I know the winds are blowing and I know the days may seem dark, but I want you to know before we say anything else, I love you."
[time=1576] And do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you
[time=1584] for your testing as though some strange thing were happening to you.
[time=1589] But to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing so that also at the revelation of His glory, at His second coming when all of this goes away and we move into eternity, at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exaltation.
[time=1608] If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
[time=1616] Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer or thief or evil doer or a
[time=1622] troublesome medler.
[time=1625] But if anyone suffers as a Christian, is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name.
[time=1633] For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God.
[time=1638] And if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
[time=1644] And if it is with difficulty that the righteous has saved, what will become of the godless man in the center?
[time=1652] Verse 19, "Therefore those also who suffer according to the will of God
[time=1659] shall entrust their souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right."
[time=1666] Pray with me, would you, Father God, we come before you again this morning.
[time=1671] So grateful that we can.
[time=1674] And so thankful for your word and so thankful for the text that we come to this morning that speaks to something so relevant and prevalent in our lives,
[time=1685] God, how we should respond.
[time=1688] When life hurts, when there is great sorrow, when there is mistreatment, God, when we experience difficulty and trial, we find today here in your word
[time=1699] God a way through. We find here in your word today, God direction.
[time=1705] And we pray, God, that as we give ourselves to it today, God, as we come and submit our minds and our hearts and our spirits to what you have to say, God, I pray that each person here would be held up, reminded, taught, encouraged, and shown in a fresh and new way.
[time=1725] The joy of suffering, the peace that can be found not necessarily even on the
[time=1732] other side of it, God, but in the midst of it.
[time=1737] We pray that is what you will help us see and will thank you for it in your son's name. And they all agreed and said, "Amen, would you have a seat?" And look with me if you would. At 1 Peter 4, we'll start right there in verse 12.
[time=1753] The Christian's view of suffering. We should, number one, write it down.
[time=1759] We should expect it. We should expect it. That's right.
[time=1765] My mind goes to John 1633, where Jesus said, "In this world you will have tribulation." And look with me at 2 Timothy 3.12.
[time=1775] If you go back just a few books to 2 Timothy 3, you find there in 2 Timothy 3.12.
[time=1781] It says, "Indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus." Stop right there. If you are in this room today and you would say that it's your heart's desire to live godly in Christ Jesus, would you please just raise your hand ever so briefly? Thank you. Put them down.
[time=1798] Those people will be persecuted.
[time=1805] It's just going to happen. It's just how it is.
[time=1812] You know me. Most of you know me pretty well. I am not, I'm not doom and gloom.
[time=1818] I'm not always over on the sad side of the store. I'm not always over here with the glass half empty. No, I'm a much more the other kind of guy.
[time=1827] I'm much more going to do my best to paint a picture for you that shows not even a glass half full but like overflowing. I'm optimistic.
[time=1835] I want to see the bright side. I'm positive.
[time=1839] But I got to tell you today we got to just go ahead and do a little reality check.
[time=1843] It's important for all of us to understand this.
[time=1847] You're going to suffer and it's going to be painful.
[time=1852] It's going to be heart wrenching.
[time=1855] It's going to bring at times great confusion.
[time=1858] God's word says to you and I expect do not be surprised.
[time=1863] Don't act or think or respond as if some strange thing were happening.
[time=1868] No, what is implied there is you and I should view it as normative.
[time=1873] In the Greek here he writes in the negative that implies they were doing it.
[time=1878] He was having to correct something they were already doing.
[time=1880] They were acting as if the folks that Peter writes to.
[time=1883] They were being surprised. Think about how you respond.
[time=1887] When you hear really bad news.
[time=1889] Think about how you and I visually verbally with our body postures.
[time=1893] Think about our response when something goes wrong.
[time=1897] You got to be kidding me. No, really?
[time=1903] Tell me it isn't so. You got to be kidding me.
[time=1910] So many times we act. What? Surprised.
[time=1915] But we have got to readjust our thinking.
[time=1921] Medical tests come back and the disease has spread.
[time=1925] We've lost a job due to downsizing our son and daughter.
[time=1928] The struggle that we have with them continues to heighten.
[time=1931] A heinous crime is committed. A loved one dies unexpectedly.
[time=1937] My friends listen in a sinful, in a sinful, broken world full of sinful, broken people.
[time=1944] It's going to be very, very messy.
[time=1949] It's just going to be that way.
[time=1953] It's broken.
[time=1956] I got a hose at home and a spigot and it's all bust.
[time=1960] It doesn't work.
[time=1962] I keep trying to get it to work. It doesn't work.
[time=1964] It just leaks. And you know me in fixing things.
[time=1967] I'm trying my best to get this hose and the spigot.
[time=1971] It's been dripping for like five years.
[time=1974] So there's the rust all over the side. It's just a mess.
[time=1978] It's broken.
[time=1981] A hose in the spigot. It doesn't work.
[time=1986] It's ugly. It's messy. It's broken.
[time=1993] It's stuff that's broken. It's just messy.
[time=1998] That's our world. To a degree that you and I.
[time=2004] And he doesn't say, listen, he doesn't say don't be sad.
[time=2008] He doesn't say walk around with a fake smile on your face and live in pretense like everything's rosy.
[time=2013] He doesn't say don't be sad. He says don't be what? Surprised.
[time=2020] Each day I get up. Pretty much you can count on it.
[time=2024] Each and every day from the moment my knees hit the ground next to my bed
[time=2030] or I may be just praying in the bathroom or it might be on the way to the office early.
[time=2036] Somewhere in there, each and every day, I say I recognize
[time=2042] I've grown to realize that something today is kind of a conversation I have with God.
[time=2046] I know something today is going to break my heart.
[time=2052] I'm going to hear something. I'm going to see something.
[time=2056] Something's going to come across my path.
[time=2058] You and I are going to hear about something, meet somebody, hear a story, and we'll see it all over again.
[time=2067] The heartbreak and the heartache of a broken world and all the pain and confusion that comes with it.
[time=2073] And I want you to see something here. Please don't miss this.
[time=2076] There's two things I want you to see. Number one, I think you've got the picture.
[time=2079] It's a life filled with fiery ordeals because it is a broken world.
[time=2085] That's true. But I don't want you to miss this.
[time=2088] Most importantly, it's a life filled with fiery ordeals because God, what does the text say?
[time=2096] God allows testing. God allows you and I to be tried.
[time=2104] He allows you and I in His providence and sovereignty, this loving, holy God who has your best interest at heart.
[time=2113] See, He allows you and I to face it.
[time=2116] He allows it to come our way. He allows the winds to blow hard and the night to get dark.
[time=2123] Because He has something for you. He has something for me to see.
[time=2128] He has something for you and I to understand or grasp more fully.
[time=2135] And some of you in the room right then, right there when I said that, some of you in this room go see Kelly right there.
[time=2140] That is what I don't get and that's what I don't like.
[time=2145] Because if He's so loving and if He's so kind and if He's so compassionate, then why did He allow this or why did He allow that?
[time=2158] And I'll tell you what, my friends.
[time=2162] As I age and see more of life, I feel much more comfortable and as I understand this maybe a little bit better, I feel much more comfortable saying to some of you at times.
[time=2174] I don't know.
[time=2179] I don't know. I don't understand that completely.
[time=2184] But I'll tell you this, when I don't understand Him, I default to what I do know.
[time=2191] And what I do know is that He loves you and gave His Son so you could be saved.
[time=2199] So don't you and I, let's not question His love for us.
[time=2203] If we want to question His methods, which sometimes are high and above and beyond, what we can understand fine, but what I do know is that He loves you and He's got something for you in the midst of this.
[time=2216] I love what it says there in 1 Peter back in our passage.
[time=2222] It says in 1 Peter 4, "The fiery ordeal among you which comes upon you for your testing, so you can be grown."
[time=2232] Okay, this in no way compares to some of the heavy duty stuff I know that many of you are facing, but here's the deal because some folks would say, "See, that's just not a very loving father."
[time=2242] Well, okay, my mind goes back to about a year ago, we got a couple of kittens for Wesley and Matty.
[time=2250] And I've gone on record before and I'll publicly say it again, I hate cats.
[time=2255] I dislike cats.
[time=2260] But you know, it was okay, these two black little kittens and they were just through the ceiling with excitement and we got these kittens and they were Wesley and Matty's and they began to take care of them.
[time=2271] They kind of grew on me a little bit, that's about all I'll say about that.
[time=2276] And it was just kind of fun and I'll never forget the day, I got a call in my office from Deborah and they had just been around for about maybe two months, little tiny things.
[time=2285] And the carpet cleaner guy had come into the driveway a little bit too fast and he didn't see one of these little guys and boom, it was over, just dead right there.
[time=2296] So she calls me and tells me and she says, "You've got to tell the girls." Because the girls were just about to get out of school. So I have Lori kind of track the girls down and she gets them and they come into my office and you're like, "Hi Daddy, how is your day? What's going on? Hurry, we got to catch our ride home."
[time=2314] And I said, "Girls have a seat. I got to tell you something." And they said, "Sure." And they kissed me on the cheek.
[time=2319] I'm just thinking, "Oh my goodness." And Lori can tell you, this is one of the saddest five minutes you've ever, you ever want to hear in your life.
[time=2326] And then what happened to the kitten. And the cries that came out of their mouths, I mean they, they lost it.
[time=2336] You've heard those cries that come from deep down inside and they just wept on the spot, lost it, crying their eyes out, clawing my shoulders, resting their heads on my chest, just weeping.
[time=2355] And I thought, at that moment, I thought to myself, "What the, and then these are my girls. I don't like to see this." And I thought, just for a moment, I thought, "What an idiot. Why didn't you just like say a hawk came down and swept it away or you're a great storyteller, Kelly?
[time=2373] Why didn't you like come up with some amazing tale of how the kitten got lost or better yet? Why didn't you tell Deborah to go to the pet store and get a black kitten and just put the stupid thing in the cage?
[time=2384] And they'd never know the difference.
[time=2390] They're weeping.
[time=2394] And one of the next thoughts that came to my mind was, you know what?
[time=2400] That's life.
[time=2403] Kittens die. Hard times come. And how dare I try to manipulate and rob my kids of an opportunity to begin to learn how to deal with that.
[time=2420] So I cried with them a little bit and I hugged them and, you know, it lasted about five minutes and let them know that a friend had offered to give them a new kitten and they perked up and their eyes were bright and was like, "Wow, that was quick."
[time=2439] Expect it. My friends, it's going to happen. It's going to come your way. It's going to hurt. It's going to be confusing.
[time=2452] Expect it. And don't just expect it, but look what he says. Go back to our text as though some strange thing were happening to you, but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing.
[time=2464] We're rejoicing about this so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exaltation.
[time=2474] I want you to stop right there and I want you to write this down. Embrace it. Embrace it.
[time=2481] Put your joy. Embrace it. Put your arms around the suffering. And you're sitting there going, "Oh, come on now. You've got to be absolutely nuts, Kelly. What are you talking about? No, trust me on this."
[time=2494] Expect it. It's going to happen. And when it comes, be willing. Be trusting enough of Him and what He has for you in it and put your arms around it.
[time=2507] Here's my point. We spend so much time, money, and effort today trying to get away from suffering. Do you realize that?
[time=2521] Do you realize the effort you put forth? Do you realize the choices that we make? Do you realize the kind of resources we throw at a lifestyle and an existence that we do our very best to keep it far, far away, embrace it?
[time=2536] Are you kidding me? I want to be as far away from it as I can.
[time=2541] Number of examples came to mind. One would be our kids. I just touched on it. We shall listen. We shelter. I shelter my kids.
[time=2553] You may as well. I'll just speak for myself. I find myself sheltering my kids from the painful consequences of theirs and others' choices.
[time=2565] I see this in school. I see it often. We've experienced it in our family. I've had to get better at this and I see it with others.
[time=2575] I see it in children's ministry. I see it. I see parents and kids and this dynamic. I see a kid get mistreated.
[time=2583] I see a kid who gets talked to a certain way. I see a kid who gets teased. I see something really not so good go down on a playground.
[time=2592] And the kid scurries home and does what a kid would do. A kid would tell his mom and dad, "Hey, Jimmy did this."
[time=2598] Or, "Hey, Susie said this." And here comes the mom and dad scurrying back to make sure that everything gets taken care of and that everybody gets dealt with.
[time=2609] So that little Sammy or Julie or whoever doesn't have to go through a bad playground experience.
[time=2615] Now, listen, I understand there would be something. Remember, I grew up with Mark Menendez.
[time=2622] There would be some things you would want to come to school and get straight.
[time=2628] But I'll tell you what, I've had to learn that sometimes the best response to a nine-year-old looking me in the eye saying, "Dad, you wouldn't believe what he said to me."
[time=2638] Is to say, "What did he say?" And then to hear what he said and say, "Back to my nine-year-old."
[time=2645] I'm really sorry. That hurts, doesn't it?
[time=2652] Yeah. Okay. Well, we'll just keep at it.
[time=2659] Well, but what do you... You know what I mean? Sometimes we need to just let them see a little bit of life and understand that it is the embracing of the suffering and not the ability to keep it at bay that grows them and matures them.
[time=2675] I see it all the time.
[time=2677] I see it in this situation. I see it when people act and work so hard to appear as if they're fine while all the while, their personal walk with God, their hearts, their marriages or their families are absolutely imploding.
[time=2694] Some of you in the room today, you know it's not going well.
[time=2700] And yet there's this thing in you that just doesn't want to admit it. There's this pride in you that doesn't want to seek help. There's this something in you that just wants to put on a smiley face and walk around here like everything's good.
[time=2713] It's all good.
[time=2715] And it's not. You're dying.
[time=2718] But you just don't want to embrace the fact that it's as broken as it is.
[time=2725] And I think that breaks God's heart.
[time=2730] We start to lose ground with a son or a daughter.
[time=2733] We get hard news from the doctor.
[time=2736] And here's something else I see us do. I see me do this. We immediately jump with great energy and determination to the solution side.
[time=2745] Does that make sense? You know somebody like that?
[time=2749] There is in some of us, there just isn't the willingness to just sit there in the midst of it all having kind of fallen down around us.
[time=2757] And just for a time, I'm not talking about getting lost here.
[time=2760] I'm just saying there I think is an appropriate place for you and I to not get on the solution side, embrace the suffering and just let it be what it is.
[time=2771] And in the midst of that, rely on, look to, get on our knees, cry out for our refuge and our rock.
[time=2783] Scripture says don't live in denial, embrace it, knowing that endurance, perseverance today brings even greater glory and rejoicing later.
[time=2794] See, I got to be honest with you my friends. I think at times in the past I've even been guilty of this. I really do.
[time=2801] I think at times in the past I may have taught you. I try to teach you well.
[time=2807] I think at times in the past I may have, even in my youth, taught you inaccurately.
[time=2812] I sometimes, as I look back, feel as if I can paint as we talk about this issue.
[time=2818] I can sometimes be guilty of painting a picture that says hang in there, which is true.
[time=2823] Endure, which is good. And at some point, I mean it might be a week or it might be three months or it could be five years, but at some point he's going to help you figure out what all this meant.
[time=2834] Here, and I'm learning, see, and I wouldn't say it to you that way anymore.
[time=2841] I would say to you, please friend, endure, please expect it. Oh, please embrace it.
[time=2849] Understand he's got something for you in this and know that it might be a week. It could be three months. It could be five years.
[time=2856] But also understand this. On this side of glory you may not ever fully understand.
[time=2862] It may not all come together here, but that doesn't mean that the God of God doesn't love you.
[time=2868] And I want to show you something here. Look at 2 Corinthians 4.
[time=2874] You go to 2 Corinthians 4, verse 16. This is so important. Look at this.
[time=2879] It says, "Therefore we do not lose heart as we experience the suffering."
[time=2885] He says, "We don't lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying because we keep facing the trial, because we continue to be tested, because we keep living life in a broken world as broken people.
[time=2899] Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day."
[time=2905] Look at verse 17. For momentary, that's what it really is.
[time=2910] We make so much more of it. It's momentary light affliction.
[time=2918] It's producing for us a temporal now weight of glory? No. No, it's producing for us an eternal weight of glory, far beyond all comparison.
[time=2932] Here it is. While we look not at the things which are seen, the suffering, the doctor's report, the relationship with the son, the marriage that's imploding,
[time=2943] we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.
[time=2948] For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[time=2955] He is preparing you. He is growing you. He is building into you and I for a better day.
[time=2963] And you may get some clarity here, and you may not, but he loves you deeply.
[time=2972] Number three, write this down. Evaluate. Evaluate your suffering.
[time=2978] Look with me at verse 15. It says in verse 15, "Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer or thief or evildoer or a troublesome meddler, but if anyone suffers, if you're going to suffer,
[time=2992] he says, all right, suffer as a Christian. But if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name."
[time=3005] You know what he says to you and I today, my friends? He says this.
[time=3008] "Suffer for being a faithful follower of Christ. Suffer for having loved deeply. Suffer for taking the right stand at the right place, the right time. Suffer for having integrity.
[time=3023] Suffer for loving the unlovely. Suffer for refusing to compromise. Suffer for the kindness you showed in serving another.
[time=3032] Don't suffer because of your self-serving sin. Don't do that.
[time=3041] Life's hard enough. You're going to face enough as it is. If you're going to suffer, suffer for doing what's right.
[time=3050] Many of you in this room know what that means and what that looks like. You've been there.
[time=3057] I can remember early on a situation. I've told you about it in the past. As I thought about it this week, I realized I've only told you about the end.
[time=3066] I never told you about the beginning, but I can remember the very first church I was ever at, the first chance.
[time=3072] I ever got to do what I get to do with my life. I was young, Deborah and I had just been married for a couple of years.
[time=3078] And we found ourself at a church and there were in the beginning days of that relationship some really, really good, sweet times.
[time=3085] As that thing kind of went on, it got really ugly. This is the place where, if you'll remember from the stories I've told you in the past,
[time=3091] this is the place where when it got really, really ugly at the end, I went to church one Sunday and all the deacons were in my office.
[time=3098] And I opened the door and there they all were and they fired me right there on the spot, remember that?
[time=3103] And that began a boy about a six, eight month period stretch in our life. They fired me. I had no job.
[time=3111] Deborah was pregnant and it was really, really, really scary.
[time=3115] That all got there, I believe, because one of those guys, three years before that, I had been there for about three weeks.
[time=3126] I mean, I was just as squeaky, clean and green as they came. I was just so excited to be getting to do this.
[time=3133] And I remember one of my first appointments was a gal and a guy coming in for kind of a premarital meeting.
[time=3140] And I remember them coming in and she was the daughter of a pillar in this church, one of these deacon guys.
[time=3148] He'd been there from the day they put the first brick down, one of those kind of guys.
[time=3152] He just, he had his life invested in that place and she comes in and I kind of knew her.
[time=3157] I didn't know this guy and we talked for about ten minutes and that was all it took.
[time=3160] I realized as clear as day and I appreciated the guy's forthrightness.
[time=3164] He didn't know the Lord. He didn't love the Lord. He wasn't committed to Christ and he had no plans to be.
[time=3172] And she was, but I think was struggling, but she knew the Lord and she knew the truth and she knew, she knew.
[time=3180] I'm sitting here thinking she's got to know what I'm thinking.
[time=3184] So I would do this differently today than I did that day, but nonetheless I jumped in on this and told them,
[time=3192] "I can't do this." I just, I just knew, I mean there's a lot of things you don't want to do.
[time=3198] One of the top of the list is you'd never, ever, ever marry somebody who didn't know the Lord.
[time=3203] It doesn't make him a bad guy. It just, it just doesn't work.
[time=3209] And God's words just don't do that. Don't join that.
[time=3212] So I lovingly tried to carefully say, "Can't do it. Not going to do it.
[time=3218] Let's think this through. Let's meet again." While she scurries home to Dad and by the time that day came to an end, he was in my office with the door slammed behind him.
[time=3230] He had his finger. He was a construction guy. I'll never forget his finger. I can see it right now.
[time=3236] I close my eyes. His, his, his old, crackly, big, thick, old finger.
[time=3241] And he was wagging it in my face. And he put his finger right on my nose and said, "You snot no seminary punk.
[time=3251] Who do you think you are? You will marry my little girl."
[time=3259] And I said, deep breath, "Oh, I won't. Not going to do it. Can't, can't do it."
[time=3270] And he just threw a fit. And he threw a fit for about three years.
[time=3275] And there wasn't a guy in that room that morning when they fired me who had a bigger grin on his face than that guy.
[time=3283] And what came from that was from my wife and I, some of the darkest days, you can ask her today, some of the darkest, hardest days of our life, were those eight to nine months.
[time=3292] And we just learned early on, and I'm still learning.
[time=3297] Just, just, if you're going to suffer, suffer for doing what's right.
[time=3301] And if you've suffered for doing what's wrong, you know what my friend? Make it right. Stop.
[time=3310] Number four, and trust, and trust our suffering to him.
[time=3320] And I'll just ask if you would to stand quietly, if you would. I want to just end with this.
[time=3325] Would you just stand right where you're at? And let me just, as you stand, let me just read to you what it says in 1 Peter 2, 23.
[time=3335] My friends, I beg you today to expect it.
[time=3339] I implore you, I plead with you, to embrace it. Don't try to live life without it.
[time=3346] Evaluate it. Make sure you're suffering for the right reasons.
[time=3352] But when it's all said and done, I want you to remember, verse 19 says, Therefore those also who suffer according to the will of God shall, what? Say that word out loud.
[time=3364] Shall entrust their souls to a faithful creator.
[time=3370] Peter has said this earlier in our study. Look what it says in 1 Peter 2, 23.
[time=3377] And while being reviled, he did not revile in return. While suffering, he uttered no threats, but kept what?
[time=3388] But kept entrusting. Kept it's a banking term. It means to deposit completely into.
[time=3395] He just gives it all. You and I just are to give it all, to deposit all of it into God's accounts.
[time=3402] Say, here it's yours. You do with me in the midst of this, whatever you're going to do with me.
[time=3407] But I entrust myself and this suffering to you.
[time=3414] He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously.
[time=3420] Verse 19, back in 1 Peter 4, entrust their souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right.
[time=3430] Amen? Amen. Let me pray for you. God, many in the room today are suffering.
[time=3439] And it takes on all kinds of shapes and forms and sizes.
[time=3443] God, some in the room this morning are beginning to suffer. God, some find themselves in the midst of it.
[time=3450] God, there are others who, for whatever reason, God, it just seems like they've been suffering for a long, long time.
[time=3459] And I think more than anything, God, I would want to give them not an answer today, but I would want to give them renewed hope in a God that really does love them.
[time=3468] For we know the enemy today would want us to grow skeptical in our view of you, God.
[time=3473] He would want us to be diminished in our faith and trust in you, God.
[time=3477] And yet we would be called by you in Scriptures today, God, to entrust our suffering all over again to you.
[time=3486] To accept it, to be expectant of it, God, to embrace it, to learn all that we can and see all that there is to be seen.
[time=3494] And so, God, we commit ourselves to that.
[time=3498] Journey, again, God, we thank you for the privilege of studying your Word.
[time=3503] We thank you for the people who have come today to share in this together.
[time=3507] God, we pray you would continue to grow us, continue, God, to give us opportunities to share this truth with others.
[time=3514] And we look forward, God, if it be your will, to being together again soon.
[time=3519] And we pray all of this in the precious name of your Son. Amen.
