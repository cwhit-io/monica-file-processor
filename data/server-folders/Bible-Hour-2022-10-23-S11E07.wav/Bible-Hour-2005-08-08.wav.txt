[time=1053] (thunder rumbling) - Let me read this to you.
[time=1058] I won't have it on the screen.
[time=1060] I'm not gonna ask you to open your Bible.
[time=1062] I just want you to listen to what God's word says in the book of Proverbs.
[time=1069] Listen and think about this.
[time=1073] It's not real long, it's not real complicated, but it is so very true.
[time=1079] Proverbs 23, seven, for as a man thinks, within himself, for as a man thinks,
[time=1092] within himself, so he, what, is.
[time=1098] So as a man thinks, God's word says,
[time=1104] so as a man or woman, boy or girl, young and old, as one thinks within himself, God's word says, so he is.
[time=1118] So who are you?
[time=1127] What are you?
[time=1130] What goes on in between those ears of yours?
[time=1134] What do you think about yourself?
[time=1138] Are you unattractive?
[time=1142] Are you successful?
[time=1145] Are you rich?
[time=1147] Are you poor?
[time=1148] Are you ugly?
[time=1151] Are you pretty?
[time=1152] Are you funny?
[time=1153] What do you think about you?
[time=1158] It's an amazing thing.
[time=1161] I've learned over the years that there is nothing more powerful or influential in people's lives than the mind.
[time=1167] Do you understand that?
[time=1169] It is one of the most powerful things God has ever put together.
[time=1173] The mind is an amazing instrument.
[time=1177] Nothing more powerful or influential in the lives of people than their minds.
[time=1181] Now listen, by mind this morning, as we discuss this, by mind I don't mean the brain as much as I do the spirit of a person.
[time=1192] Or maybe better yet said, the posture of your soul.
[time=1197] How's that?
[time=1199] Who you really, really are way down deep inside.
[time=1204] Your mind, my mind.
[time=1211] It's what I think about, yes, but my mindset is what I think about, run through the grid of what I long for, what I value most, what I, here you go, what I believe to be true, what you and I believe to be true, way down deep inside, that my friends is the mind,
[time=1234] the posture of our soul, the spirit that we possess.
[time=1239] What I believe to be true, what I value, the posture or the condition of my soul in mind, that is what I will be.
[time=1249] That is what I will do, it is where I will go.
[time=1256] It's pretty incredible for me to just think about that, that truth, that reality, even in my own life.
[time=1264] You see most of you know this, I've shared it with you in the past, before September 1983, before September 83, my mind, the posture of my soul,
[time=1278] what I really thought and who I really was.
[time=1284] Before September 1983, that point at which I fully surrendered finally, my heart and life to the person of Christ, I was, my mind was independent.
[time=1298] As I go, and I'm just gonna share with you what my mind was like.
[time=1303] Many of you in the room may identify, as you think back to what it was like for you, what your mind was like, what the posture of your soul was like prior to knowing him.
[time=1315] Others of you in the room, as I go through this and share this with you, you may be on your own journey, you may not be at a place of faith in relationship with him yet, you may hear this and go, "My goodness, that's me." My mind was then independent.
[time=1332] What do I mean by that?
[time=1334] Well, I'll tell you what I mean by that.
[time=1336] I, me, I was the authority in my life.
[time=1341] Most of you know my story, you know what I had been through from the age of 17 on to about 20.
[time=1346] And all I had seen and what I had endured, I'll tell you what, nobody was gonna be in charge of my life anymore.
[time=1352] It was me, I was in charge, I was the authority.
[time=1357] I trusted no one, not anymore.
[time=1361] My mind was prideful.
[time=1365] That's right, I lived for me.
[time=1367] See, I had spent my life, remember my story, I had spent my life living for some others.
[time=1373] And that hadn't gotten me anywhere, but devastated, destroyed, and confused.
[time=1377] So now I lived for me.
[time=1379] It was all about my agenda, it was about what I wanted, my mind, the posture of my soul was prideful.
[time=1386] My mind was lustful, that's right, lustful.
[time=1391] You say, "Well, what do you mean by that?" Well, everything that comes to your mind.
[time=1395] I lived for me, every night and every day,
[time=1401] I wanted my pain, and there was plenty of it.
[time=1405] I wanted my pain replaced by pleasure.
[time=1409] It's a pretty normal thing.
[time=1412] I wanted it relieved, and I would go anywhere and do about anything to numb the pain and ease the hurt.
[time=1420] My mind was independent, it was prideful, it was lustful, it was, and this will, this one thing, probably above any other thing, probably shows you the transforming work that God does in the life of a person.
[time=1437] I was pessimistic.
[time=1439] Can you believe that?
[time=1442] Me.
[time=1443] Yeah, boy, I hated life.
[time=1447] I was negative.
[time=1451] I was so burned, and I was so distraught, and I was so fed up, I believed the worst about people.
[time=1459] I believed the worst about life.
[time=1460] I believed the worst about everything that I faced, and I didn't care.
[time=1465] I was prideful, independent, lustful, pessimistic, and you know what I was?
[time=1471] You probably, fifthly, you can write this down, I was hopeless, and anybody far from God, anybody trying to live life outside of relationship with God, most of us in that state would never admit this.
[time=1485] I probably wouldn't have said this to you 23 years ago, but the reality was I was hopeless.
[time=1491] Are you kidding me?
[time=1493] God, heaven, and happiness?
[time=1497] It was a joke in my mind.
[time=1500] Posture of my heart toward all of that, are you kidding me?
[time=1504] Joy, blessing, and reward for faithfulness?
[time=1509] A pipe dream, and a painful pipe dream at that.
[time=1514] I wanted absolutely nothing to do with it, and there was in the end no hope.
[time=1519] And I want you to understand this morning, as we talk about it, and as we study and look at this issue of the mind, the posture of your heart and soul, all that I just detailed for you there, all that I just described, I need you to understand and see again today, my friends, that this is the mind, that is the mind of the unredined.
[time=1541] Whether they admit it, see it, talk about it, or not, that is the mind of the unredined.
[time=1550] Look at Romans 8, turning your Bibles to Romans 8, verses 5 through 8, talks about this, Paul speaks to this in Romans 8, 5 to 8, says there for those who are according to, or given to, or committed, right?
[time=1570] For those who are according to the flesh, set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to, or committed to, the spirit, the things of the spirit.
[time=1584] For the mindset on the flesh is death, but the mindset on the spirit is life and peace, because the mindset on the flesh is hostile, hostile toward God, prideful, independent, lustful, pessimistic, and hopeless.
[time=1600] For it does not subject itself to the law of God,
[time=1606] doesn't subject itself to that, for it is not even able to do so.
[time=1611] And those who are in the flesh, apart from God, cannot please God.
[time=1621] The mind, the posture of the soul, the unredeemment.
[time=1625] If you go back to Romans 1, 28, says in Romans 1, 28, and just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God, any longer God gave them over to a depraved what?
[time=1636] To a depraved mind to do those things which are not proper.
[time=1642] Go to Ephesians 4.
[time=1644] Galatians, Ephesians, Ephesians chapter 4.
[time=1650] Pick it up in verse 17, the unredeemed mind.
[time=1655] So this I say, Paul writes, "And affirm together with the Lord that you, believers, "Christ followers, walk no longer just as the Gentiles, "the unredeemed walk, in the futility of their what?" Say it, in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their heart and they having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness, stop right there.
[time=1691] This is the mind of the unredeemed.
[time=1694] Now, amazing truth, life-giving truth,
[time=1702] life-changing truth here.
[time=1703] I stood here and told you about two, three months ago what my favorite word in all of scripture is.
[time=1710] I told you then, I'll tell it to you again today.
[time=1713] Hands down, not even close.
[time=1715] My favorite word in all of scripture is what?
[time=1718] Redeemed, redeemed.
[time=1722] My friends, there is something really special about being made new.
[time=1728] There is something really glorious about that which was lost being brought back to home.
[time=1734] There is something amazing about that which was broken and devastated being put back together, shiny and new.
[time=1744] Redemption, being redeemed.
[time=1747] And you know what?
[time=1748] He does that.
[time=1749] He redeems us and he redeems our minds.
[time=1753] He redeems the posture of our souls, what we believe down deep inside, what we're capable of believing and thinking.
[time=1763] Watch what happens to the mind when it gets redeemed.
[time=1766] Stay in Ephesians four and just pick it up in verse 20.
[time=1771] But you did not learn Christ in this way if you have heard him and have been taught in him.
[time=1778] If you've been redeemed just as truth is in Jesus that in reference to your former manner of life you lay aside the old self which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of the seed and that you be renewed in the spirit of your say it.
[time=1795] Mind and put on the new self which is in the likeness of God which in the likeness of God has been created.
[time=1804] This new self, this new mind it's been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
[time=1811] That my friends, listen.
[time=1814] That, look at that last line.
[time=1818] Made in the likeness of God it's been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
[time=1823] Who are you?
[time=1826] That's you.
[time=1829] You understand that?
[time=1831] Hey, hey, you're not successful.
[time=1834] You're not poor, you're not ugly, you're not attractive.
[time=1837] You're not lonely, you're not funny.
[time=1840] You're holy and righteous.
[time=1844] And you've been made new and he loves you.
[time=1849] He loves you deeply.
[time=1850] You are a Christ follower.
[time=1853] And your mind has been completely the spirit and posture of your soul has been absolutely made new.
[time=1861] To think, move and go in new, exciting directions.
[time=1867] The truth of the matter is he saved me in September of 83 and he redeems people just like you and I.
[time=1874] He makes hard hearts and sinful minds new.
[time=1877] He alters completely the posture of our souls and says come and follow me.
[time=1882] Let's live, let's think, let's choose like this.
[time=1886] And whether you're 14 or 20 something or married with kids or divorced or married again or a mom and a dad or a grandma and a grandpa it doesn't matter whoever you are when you fully surrender your heart and life to him.
[time=1902] It is possible to have this life that he has called you to.
[time=1906] When you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him you now possess a fully surrendered mind.
[time=1913] It's all been changed.
[time=1916] And you have the posture in soul and spirit of a follower of Christ.
[time=1922] You say, well, what does that new mind look like?
[time=1926] What is that redeemed posture?
[time=1929] The posture of my soul.
[time=1930] What does that look like, Kelly?
[time=1932] Well, actually it's right here.
[time=1934] It's right here in our closing passage of 1 Peter 5.
[time=1938] That's right.
[time=1939] Our closing passage, what we began months ago.
[time=1942] I don't even know when we started 1 Peter.
[time=1944] Anybody know when we started 1 Peter?
[time=1946] I have no idea when we started.
[time=1948] If you know when we started 1 Peter, tell me afterwards.
[time=1951] But it was a while ago and it brings us this study and this discussion that we've been in.
[time=1956] It brings us today to the end.
[time=1959] And what a new mind, a spiritually transformed mind,
[time=1966] the posture of one's heart and soul, what that looks like, what it can be like.
[time=1970] It's delineated for us right here as Peter wraps this up.
[time=1975] As we come to the end of our study, we find that Peter in review fashion.
[time=1979] Here's the deal on this last chapter, you guys.
[time=1981] You won't hear anything.
[time=1985] He takes, look, he takes all of this.
[time=1988] He takes all of this amazing truth.
[time=1990] He takes all of these things that we've looked at and studied.
[time=1993] He takes it all and it's as if he just kind of created God just creatively and powerfully, packs it into one last passage.
[time=2001] I think it was important to him.
[time=2003] I think it is important to him that he would say to you and I, after all these months, when it's all said and done, when holiness, you as a believer, meets hostility, you all as you live out your faith in this world I've placed you in.
[time=2016] Here are some things that in your mind, in the posture of your soul, you're going to have to remember.
[time=2022] I'm going to tell you again.
[time=2025] Don't lose these things.
[time=2026] Be marked by, be characterized by these things in your mind.
[time=2033] It gives us one last look at the attitudes and mindset needed to persevere through this brief, sometimes painful life and be found in the end faithful in our love and commitment to follow him.
[time=2045] 1 Peter 5, 5 through 11, would you stand this morning in honor of God's Word and would you allow me the privilege of reading this for you before we study?
[time=2059] It says in 1 Peter 5, verse 5, you younger men likewise.
[time=2064] You younger men likewise.
[time=2067] Be subject to your elders and all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another.
[time=2074] For God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[time=2081] I can't ever read that without pausing.
[time=2086] I don't know about you.
[time=2089] I know my view of God is in process.
[time=2091] I know I'm learning as the days go by about my God.
[time=2094] But the view of God that I have today, my understanding of who he is, his majestic holiness, his great strength and might, my view of God and his power, and his love for that which is right and his willingness to execute judgment on that which is wrong.
[time=2111] When I read that God, not my neighbor, not the difficult co-worker, not the guy in an argument, no, when I hear that God is opposed to me or you,
[time=2128] I don't know how that strikes you.
[time=2131] But when I realize that, it's like I want to just get out of there fast, God is opposed.
[time=2137] He is, the word means he is against the proud,
[time=2143] but gives grace to the humble.
[time=2145] Therefore, no kidding, therefore humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
[time=2160] What a great contrast.
[time=2161] This God of judgment that is against, he also cares for you.
[time=2167] That word is a tender, soft, penetrating, almost like cuddly word.
[time=2175] He cares for you.
[time=2177] God does.
[time=2180] Wow, be of sober spirit.
[time=2182] Be on the alert, your adversary, the devil, your adversary.
[time=2186] Yours, you, you, you, you have an adversary.
[time=2193] He is against, and he is looking for, and he wants to ruin you, your personal adversary.
[time=2201] It's not some big general thing.
[time=2203] No, he is after you.
[time=2206] Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=2213] But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.
[time=2222] Great reality check there.
[time=2223] Listen, you and I, we're not the only ones going through it.
[time=2227] We're not the ones that are experiencing it worse than anybody else.
[time=2232] No, no, no, we are in this together, and no temptation, no trial has overtaken you, but such as is common to man.
[time=2242] Experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world after you have suffered for a little while-- great phrase-- after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
[time=2261] What a great day that will be.
[time=2264] To him be dominion forever and ever, and they all agreed and were thankful and said, amen.
[time=2270] You can be seated.
[time=2274] Wow.
[time=2277] My friends, the mind, not so much the brain, but the posture of the soul, the condition of your spirit, the mind of the Christ follower must be characterized.
[time=2290] Write this down.
[time=2291] Must be characterized by you and I.
[time=2294] Our minds must be marked by some things that he gives us here in this passage, all of which are review.
[time=2300] Let's just look at them.
[time=2301] Let's just write them down.
[time=2302] Let's just take one last look.
[time=2305] And hopefully in the midst of this last look, be encouraged and challenged.
[time=2309] Number one, write it down.
[time=2310] It says there in verses 5 and 6 that our minds should be characterized by submission and humility.
[time=2318] By submission and humility, you, younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders.
[time=2325] There's some talk and discussion here as to why he points out younger men.
[time=2329] The context kind of leans that way and yet as the context, as the passage continues, he obviously moves to everybody.
[time=2337] This is a passage designed for all of us.
[time=2340] Yet he specifies younger men.
[time=2342] Some would suggest he specifies younger men in this issue of submission because for some younger men, that's an issue.
[time=2352] I don't know.
[time=2354] I know some younger women who may struggle with that.
[time=2358] We all struggle with that, to some degree.
[time=2360] But nonetheless, he points out younger men.
[time=2362] And he talks about it and speaks to them under the umbrella of this issue of submission, coming under willingly, respectfully, with the understanding of the great purpose that it provides.
[time=2375] He says that we are to be submissive in our minds.
[time=2379] In the beginning of chapter 5, last week, if you were here, we talked about the call upon leaders in the church to submit to the chief shepherd.
[time=2388] And here now, he says to the rest of the family, you likewise fall under and submit to your elders, not in this case, not the older people.
[time=2398] In this case, the Prezbuteros, those men who have been called by God to lead and love and shepherd and teach and feed and guide the local family.
[time=2408] Submit to them.
[time=2410] And he says, do it well.
[time=2412] First hour, as I was thinking about this, my mind went to Hebrews.
[time=2417] Hebrews 13, 17, listen to what it says.
[time=2420] Hebrews 13, 17 says, obey your leaders and submit to them.
[time=2425] Obey your leaders and submit to them for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account.
[time=2435] Let them do this with joy and not with grief.
[time=2439] Don't make this painful for them.
[time=2442] Submit to them lovingly and submit to them respectfully and submit to them prayerfully.
[time=2447] Let them do this with joy and not with grief for this would be unprofitable for you.
[time=2456] I'll tell you what I'm struck by as I read that.
[time=2459] Anybody who shepherds and leads you in this place, I will one day stand before God and give an account for the kind of leadership that I gave you.
[time=2471] Unbelievable.
[time=2475] And I want to try and do that well.
[time=2477] And you can help me do that well by following well.
[time=2481] Doesn't mean you don't ever say anything.
[time=2482] Doesn't mean we don't ever have conversations.
[time=2485] It doesn't mean we don't ever wrestle with stuff.
[time=2487] It just means in the end, you're willing to with those that God has given.
[time=2491] You're willing to follow.
[time=2493] You're willing to be submissive in your mind in the posture of your soul.
[time=2497] And it also says back to 1 Peter 5, clothe yourselves with humility.
[time=2504] Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you at the proper time.
[time=2511] Your mind should be humble, my friends.
[time=2513] You should not think too much of yourself.
[time=2516] You should think more of others.
[time=2519] And the posture of our souls should lead us toward a humble countenance, not a prideful one.
[time=2526] Our minds must be characterized by submission, by humility.
[time=2530] Verse seven, our minds must be characterized by great trust, casting, look at verse seven, casting all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
[time=2542] You're looking at the screen right now.
[time=2544] I see many of you looking at the screen.
[time=2546] Some of you are looking at your Bible.
[time=2547] All of you, I would invite you to focus in on the one central operative word in that phrase.
[time=2554] It says there, casting how many of your anxieties?
[time=2558] Say it.
[time=2559] All, you and I, my friends, are really good sometimes at keeping one or two of them for ourselves.
[time=2568] Now watch how twisted this is.
[time=2575] Just think about this.
[time=2576] Because the God of the universe, the almighty, all knowing, all powerful God, invites you and I, no matter what it is.
[time=2586] See, no matter how scary it might be or no matter how unraveled you feel like you might be about to become no matter what pain could be there.
[time=2593] The God of the universe says to you, give it to me.
[time=2597] 'Cause I wanna take it and I wanna hold it and I wanna make it right and I wanna bring you the comfort that you need in the midst of this.
[time=2605] Hey, give me all of them.
[time=2607] Me, the God of the universe and you and I say, you know what, I, me, you know, me, I think I'll hold on to a couple.
[time=2616] And the ones we hold on to are the what?
[time=2619] The like pittily little no big deal ones?
[time=2622] No, no, you and I hold on to the biggies.
[time=2627] We hold on to the huge ones.
[time=2629] 'Cause what, 'cause we're gonna handle it, right?
[time=2633] We're gonna wrestle with it.
[time=2634] We're gonna chew on it.
[time=2636] We're gonna go over the edge, you know, fearful and ballistic.
[time=2639] I mean, we're gonna absolutely fall apart 'cause we didn't wanna give it to him.
[time=2647] I know that's not real complicated thinking there, but I just wanted to make sure we painted that clear.
[time=2651] It's just ridiculous.
[time=2653] He says, give me all of your anxieties, your fears and your concerns, the things you're just not certain about, the stuff going on at home, the things going on at work, the things that are dreadfully wrong in your marriage, give them to me and let me, well, because I care, the God of the universe cares for you.
[time=2675] We must be, in our minds, the posture of our souls, trusting.
[time=2679] I don't understand how you're gonna do it.
[time=2683] I don't know where in the world you're gonna go with this, 'cause I've thought it all through and I'm just, I'm, I'm nowhere.
[time=2688] This is just bad news, I don't know what, but you're you and I'm me and so take it.
[time=2694] He says, give it to me, all of it.
[time=2696] Mine's characterized by submission, humility.
[time=2701] Mine's characterized by trust.
[time=2703] Mine's characterized by sobriety.
[time=2705] That's right, look at verse eight.
[time=2707] Sobriety and awareness.
[time=2712] He says, be in your mind, be of sober spirit.
[time=2715] Beyond the alert, your adversary, the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=2725] We just talked about this a couple of weeks ago.
[time=2729] I won't belabor it, but I will remind you, sobriety.
[time=2732] Not a sloppy, listen, not a sloppy intoxicated life, but a spiritually ordered disciplined life.
[time=2742] How are you today?
[time=2743] In that arena of spiritual disciplines, spiritual, mental, emotional, physical disciplines, all of it going together to provide a stability and a constancy and a strength of heart and mind.
[time=2758] Sobri, not intoxicated, not sloppy, not here and there, but focused.
[time=2764] Your time with God, your time reading the word, your time memorizing the word, your time maybe just writing about the word, your time in prayer, your time in fellowship, your time in community with others, your maybe you fast, maybe I don't know what disciplines you give yourself to, but you and I should be giving ourselves to them.
[time=2784] Sobriety, clear in heart and mind and awareness.
[time=2790] Don't forget that.
[time=2792] Minds characterized by awareness, being alert.
[time=2796] We talked about this at length.
[time=2798] You and I had better be alert because you're your adversary.
[time=2802] His name is the devil.
[time=2804] Your adversary is coming after you.
[time=2807] Like a lion, like a lion it says seeking someone to devour.
[time=2814] I've seen this recently in kind of a light-hearted way,
[time=2820] but nonetheless in a very powerful way.
[time=2822] I've gotten a few cards and letters from you.
[time=2824] Recently about some comments I made about cats, I stand sorry, I stand, I stand confronted, not corrected really, but just at least I stand confronted.
[time=2835] I still think about them what I think about them, but anyway, we got a couple of cats.
[time=2841] There's the one cat, there's a black cat.
[time=2844] I don't even know his name, I just call him cat.
[time=2850] He's the black one, he's the one that didn't get hit by the van that I told you about a few weeks ago, so he survived.
[time=2855] Now we've got this new kitten.
[time=2856] I'm not sure of its name, I think its name is Tiger, but all of that to say, this black cat, it's amazing how this works.
[time=2868] My wife loves, you know, our backyard, out of our back door we've got this deck and on the deck she hung a big, really nice, cool bird feeder.
[time=2875] I mean it kind of hangs over the deck there and there's some bushes that kind of come up next to the deck and I'm telling you.
[time=2882] It was a while ago, I saw this cat.
[time=2884] Russell, what's his name, does it have a name?
[time=2888] I feel like I should call it a name, Kitty Bitty, well that's why I'm not gonna call it.
[time=2894] That's why I should have just kept my mouth shut.
[time=2899] See that's why I don't like cats, why would you call something Kitty Bitty?
[time=2903] So anyway, thanks buddy.
[time=2908] So I looked out there one day and in this, no kidding, in this bush, this cat had climbed up into this bush and out on the pretty big bush, out on this limb and this limb kind of rests against the rail of the deal and that cat is just sitting there.
[time=2923] He's just motionless and I watched him for good,
[time=2931] I'm drinking my coffee, watching him for a good 15, 20 minutes, he didn't move, I thought he was dead.
[time=2937] He was a little hopeful, but he just sat there, he just sat there, did not move.
[time=2944] There are times I see him in that position, I'll come back 30 minutes later, right, just looking at that bird feeder.
[time=2954] And I look at that and I go, come on, see that's my point right there, cats, you get a life, go chase a ball or go play with a kid, but no, 40 minutes.
[time=2966] And I'm thinking, you know what's useless, worthless waste of time.
[time=2970] Russell T and I, you'll tell you, we were in the garage of the day, we're cleaning out the garage.
[time=2974] And we make our way over to the corner of the garage and we move a few things low and behold to find, and I'm sorry, I don't wanna gross you out, but we find in the corner of the garage, decapitated birds.
[time=2986] There's a bunch of bird bodies and I'm going, wow, oh kitty bitty.
[time=2997] Just biding his time and just coming in for some seed, I'm just gonna go, just gonna go have a little fun.
[time=3007] You and I, we're just gonna, I'm just gonna cruise in there and just cruise out.
[time=3012] I'm just gonna go get some seed, I'm just gonna get a little satisfaction, I'm just gonna get a little something fun there, I'm just gonna fly in there.
[time=3021] Oh!
[time=3021] (audience laughs) And we laugh, but you know what, it's just, you have no idea where he is.
[time=3028] You have no idea what bush he's sitting at, what rock he's under, what corner he's just around.
[time=3036] You have no idea he may be coming up behind you, or he may be coming at you full steam straight ahead, either way, he's going to, if you are not alert, it's gonna clean your clock.
[time=3050] You're gonna take one right in the gut.
[time=3055] Peter says, your mind, our attitudes, the posture of our soul, it's gotta be alert.
[time=3062] We gotta be watching and looking, sober in our spirit, submissive, humble, trusting, first nine, strong.
[time=3071] Your mind and mind should be characterized by strength.
[time=3075] But resist him, firm in your faith.
[time=3078] You see that?
[time=3079] Resist him, firm in your faith.
[time=3081] That paints this picture, my friends, of you and I, and we got our foot, we got our foot against the ledge.
[time=3086] We're right there, we got our foot dug in, and you are not going to move me.
[time=3094] You can pull on me all you want, you can dangle, whatever you wanna dangle in front of me.
[time=3099] You can tempt me, you can prod me, you can prompt me.
[time=3102] But my foot is dug in, and I am going to, with the help of the spirit of God, and the word of God, and the people of God, I'm gonna stand right here.
[time=3114] And I will not move.
[time=3115] And our minds, the posture of your soul, it's gotta be that way.
[time=3122] It's gotta be that way all the time.
[time=3124] We have to discipline ourselves to be in that mode.
[time=3127] You know what, my friends?
[time=3128] Take it from me, you can't do that alone.
[time=3132] You have got to have the help, and the encouragement, and the support of the word of God, and the spirit of God, and the people of God.
[time=3144] To be strong in our minds.
[time=3147] Strength, and the posture of our soul.
[time=3150] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9, I buffet my body, he doesn't say I buffet it, he says I buffet, he says I buffet my body, I train it, I lift, I flex, I bend, I discipline, I do whatever I have to do, with the spirit of God's help to strengthen myself so I can run this race to the what, to the end.
[time=3178] Last I myself should be disqualified.
[time=3182] And then lastly, write this down, write this down.
[time=3189] Your mind and mind must be characterized by the posture of our spirit, the posture of our souls is to be characterized by hope, that's right.
[time=3200] Listen, when you have an accurate, look what it says in verse 10, after you have suffered for a little while, what a great phrase.
[time=3208] My friends, one of the hardest things I do, I mean this.
[time=3213] One of the hardest things I find myself having to do, and partly it's because I do what I do, partly it's because I'm like you, I live in community with others.
[time=3223] And when you live in community with others, you face all that they face, you go through what they go through, it happens all the time, and one of the most difficult things I have to do is to sit there or stand there or be on my knees next to one and say, stay at it.
[time=3241] I don't know what else to say.
[time=3247] And you know me, most of you know me, I love to make you happy, I wanna please you, I wanna relieve your pain, but there's times I'm just learning where in this life before heaven, we just have to be able to be on our knees next to each other and say, I'll go with you, but I don't know what to say, you just gotta stay at it.
[time=3269] And if I were to tell you that, or if you were to tell me that, and I did not have hope, boy, what a painful deal.
[time=3280] It's painful enough with hope, amen?
[time=3283] Boy, it's hard if there's no hope.
[time=3285] When you have an accurate view of God, he loves you, he loves you, he gave his son for you, he cares about you.
[time=3293] When you have an accurate view of God, when you have an accurate view of eternity, and what it will be like to eternally be perfected, confirmed, strengthened, and established, then guess what, you have the potential.
[time=3307] You and I gotta make some choices for it to be realized, but you, when you see all that, you and I have the potential to suffer with hope, to endure with great spiritual perspective, to persevere with great peace.
[time=3323] We will be perfected, confirmed, strengthened, and established, to him be dominion forever and ever, amen.
[time=3332] I'll tell you what, weak, but decent analogy here.
[time=3344] When we moved here, almost 10 years ago, I almost didn't, most of you know this, some of you might not, I almost didn't make it past the first 18 months.
[time=3355] It was so cold, it was so bitter, it was so gray.
[time=3362] It was October, like November, December, January, February,
[time=3368] you know, it was so bad.
[time=3371] I used to sit and look out the window, and I would try to mentally picture a leaf.
[time=3376] And I couldn't, I couldn't, it was so dark,
[time=3382] I couldn't picture, I tried to think of the color green, and I couldn't, it was hopeless.
[time=3390] I just couldn't, I think a few resumes got sent out, say the truth, I just couldn't do it.
[time=3396] And then you know what, year two turned into year three, and year three turned into year four, and I realized something.
[time=3407] Come March, the leaves came back, it happened.
[time=3414] I started to figure out what green was again, and I'd go through the spring and the summer, you had two days of spring, and then the summer, and then you'd get into the fall, and those first couple of years, when all the leaves would start to go away, I'd just like, oh no, no, don't fall, please stay there.
[time=3430] But you experience it, you go through the dark days, don't you?
[time=3435] And now, 10 years later, I'd rather be no place in the entire world, and I can stand there and look out the window in February, I can stand there and look out the window in December and go hey, you know what, March is coming, no big deal, it's called hope, it's not some pipe dream, it's based upon what you know to be true.
[time=3461] Leaves come back, right?
[time=3463] Let's stand.
[time=3464] Father God, we thank you for this time together, we thank you for the great truth of your word, and oh God, help us to be a people, a holy, righteous people.
[time=3474] So very flawed, yet so very loved by you.
[time=3478] Help us to grow, and our love for you, God help us to grow, and our ability and willingness to face all that life may bring, in a way that evidence is great submission, and great trust, and great humility of heart and mind.
[time=3491] God, thank you for this great study, thank you for what you've taught us, and as we go, God allow us to go through these doors today changed and willing and ready to be the people you've called us to be.
[time=3501] Bring us back together again soon, if that be your will, in your son's name we pray.
[time=3506] May I all agreed and said?
[time=3508] [AMEN]
[time=3518] (upbeat music)
[time=3547] (upbeat music) - No big deal, it's called hope.
[time=3577] Not some pipe dream, it's based upon what you know to be true, leaves come back, right?
[time=3584] Let's stand.
[time=3585] Father God, we thank you for this time together, we thank you for the great truth of your word, and oh God, help us to be a people, a holy, righteous people.
[time=3595] So very flawed, yet so very loved by you.
[time=3600] Help us to grow, and our love for you, God help us to grow, and our ability and willingness to face all that life may bring in a way that evidence is great submission, and great trust, and great humility of heart and mind.
[time=3612] God thank you for this great study, thank you for what you've taught us, and as we go, God allow us to go through these doors.
