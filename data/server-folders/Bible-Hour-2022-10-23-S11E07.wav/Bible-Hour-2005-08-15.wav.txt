[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=55] and on earth, therefore go and make disciples of all needs, baptizing them in the name
[time=66] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=77] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=83] end of the age.
[time=88] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=101] Welcome to this segment of the Bible Hour.
[time=104] It's been a treat for us to have pastors from around town come and be on the Bible Hour
[time=111] explaining what's going on at their churches.
[time=114] And today we have Pastor Jim Pearson from Brookside Community Church.
[time=118] And Jim is a long time friend of mine.
[time=120] I'm thankful for our relationship.
[time=123] And Jim has been my friend for over 20 years.
[time=126] I know he and his wife Linda, well, they're two sons Kyle and Drew and I've watched Jim be both a good parent and good husband.
[time=134] I'm not going to say anything about the bad times at all.
[time=136] He's been a wonderful family man and a great pastor.
[time=140] And I'm really thankful Jim that you're here today and welcome.
[time=143] Steve, this is just an honor for me to be here.
[time=147] It always is.
[time=148] And it's exciting.
[time=149] It's always great to spend time with you and come back to Blackhawk and be a part of this great ministry that I was a part of for years as a layperson and then as a staff member here from 1986 to 1992.
[time=162] Yeah.
[time=163] And then in '92, he went off to Fargo, North Dakota and pastor to church there, an evangelical
[time=169] free church and had a great ministry there.
[time=172] The church grew and Jim, we were blessed when Jim and Linda came back here.
[time=178] And what year did you come back to Fort Wayne to take Brookside on?
[time=182] We came back in 1997 and came to Brookside and have been there and it's almost eight years.
[time=188] Yeah.
[time=189] Tell us a little bit about what's happened at Brookside from that point to the present.
[time=193] I came to a great church, Steve.
[time=194] In 1997, Brookside Church was a church of probably about 500 people.
[time=200] And they had just completed a great family life center, gymnasium area with classrooms,
[time=207] a great addition to the ministry.
[time=209] And that had been done in '95.
[time=211] So in '97, when I came, we had that ministry, we were doing a lot of outreach through that.
[time=217] Over time, we've done some remodeling, but then of course, we got into a major project about a year ago that we're real excited about.
[time=226] Yeah, I want to know more about that in a minute, but Jim, you really have two different types of worship services on Sunday, don't you?
[time=234] Explain a little bit about how that works.
[time=235] People might be interested in knowing what you're doing there.
[time=237] Sure.
[time=238] Steve, we want to make sure that people that come to Brookside have a worship service that touches them.
[time=243] And so we still have a traditional worship service.
[time=245] We have that at 8.15 on Sunday morning.
[time=248] And we have an organ and piano, and it's a very traditional service.
[time=253] We sing a lot of hymns.
[time=256] It's a great, great time.
[time=257] I preach the same sermon in all three services.
[time=259] Then our second two services are contemporary, and we have a praise band, we have vocal teams, we have what we call the new community choir, and it's more of a contemporary feel.
[time=269] And then this fall, probably in late October, we're going to begin a new service on Sunday
[time=275] nights.
[time=277] And you mentioned a building project that you have going on.
[time=281] The future, your church, is really bright for the young people in your church.
[time=285] Your children's ministry has a new wing that you've added on.
[time=288] Why don't you tell folks about that?
[time=289] That's really exciting.
[time=290] It's about eight weeks away, Steve.
[time=293] Roughly early October, mid-October, we're going to be there.
[time=297] And we're working on it hard on it every day right now.
[time=301] It's a large addition, 38,000 square feet.
[time=304] The first floor is basically a children's ministry area.
[time=308] There is a two-story children's worship area that's just going to be great.
[time=314] There is themed classrooms.
[time=316] You enter through what we call Brookside Boulevard, which is kind of like a little street in
[time=322] an American Midwestern city.
[time=324] The kids will come into that.
[time=326] There's going to be some play areas as well, but each classroom will have its own theme.
[time=332] I really do believe it's going to be a children's ministry area like none other in the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=338] And then upstairs will be mostly adult classrooms.
[time=341] There will also be on the first floor.
[time=343] There will be a large youth area, a large fellowship hall area, just tremendous space, which we're going to add.
[time=349] Yeah.
[time=351] I've looked through some of it.
[time=352] It's pretty exciting.
[time=353] Jim, for the people that live in the area around here that aren't attending a local church right now, what would you say is true about Brookside that might have them come and join you and check out what you're doing?
[time=364] What would be interesting to people?
[time=366] I think the key would be the different styles of worship that we do.
[time=370] And as I mentioned, we're going to be starting a new service in the fall on Sunday nights.
[time=374] That's going to be for that 18 to 25-year-old demographic.
[time=378] It's going to be for college students and post-college individuals that are interested
[time=384] in a service for that age group, and we're going to start that.
[time=387] As I said, on Sunday nights, probably at 7.30.
[time=390] Don't know the exact date yet, but it will probably be in that mid-late October time frame.
[time=395] We're excited about that.
[time=396] But we try to offer something for the whole family.
[time=399] Lots for children, lots for youth.
[time=402] In the worship services, I believe our people get good sound, biblical preaching and teaching.
[time=407] No doubt about that.
[time=408] In our small groups and adult Bible fellowship classes, I believe they get the same.
[time=412] Good Bible teaching, good Bible study.
[time=415] We're grounded on the Word of God, we stand on the Word of God, and we don't apologize for that.
[time=420] And if someone is in that northeast portion of Fort Wayne or anywhere, for that matter, at Maple Crest and Evard near that intersection or in that neighborhood, we'd love to have them at Brookside on Sunday.
[time=431] Yeah.
[time=432] We're so honored to get to do church together with our brothers in Christ around town like Gem, and I'm really thankful for what's going on at Brookside.
[time=442] We're grateful that we get to partner with them as people come to Christ in our city and then get to grow there.
[time=448] You can grow there.
[time=449] Gem, I'm really thankful that you were here today.
[time=452] Thanks for being our guest.
[time=454] And God bless you.
[time=455] I love you.
[time=456] Steve, it is always a pleasure to be here at Blackhawk, but also just to be around you.
[time=461] I saw you earlier this week for a few moments, and it's always great just to touch base.
[time=466] Truly, friends for this life, and everybody over here at Blackhawk.
[time=471] We just have so many friends, some from the old days, some from now.
[time=474] It's just always great to come.
[time=476] Thanks for joining us, and just hope that you'll enjoy the rest of the Bible hour and hours we get back to our service.
[time=494] Be still, and know that he is God Even on a dark night like tonight, do you
[time=507] think He forgot, and do you think He doesn't care while He does?
[time=517] And He's more than just enough.
[time=524] I know you're going through this alone.
[time=533] You knock so hard on that door, but still there's no one home.
[time=541] But He will answer you, and answer you with love, and that's why He's more than just enough.
[time=556] You are more than just enough, you are more than just enough, yeah.
[time=570] Even when the times get rough, you're more than just enough.
[time=586] Hot tears and a heavy heart, everything is slipping away, you're falling apart.
[time=602] But He gazes down at you, beaming with love, saying child, you're more than just enough.
[time=614] You are more than just enough, you are more than just enough, even when the times get
[time=634] rough, you're more than just enough.
[time=649] There are times I feel the lines, slipping through my head's hair, my thoughts provoke
[time=679] my tears as I, I try to understand, but your hands sustain, your love remains, the only
[time=689] thing worth living for, that's why you're far, you're far, you're far, you're far, yeah.
[time=708] When I'm stumbling from you, I'm more than just enough, I'm more than just enough, even
[time=730] when the times get rough, you're more than just enough.
[time=737] You are more than just, you are more than just enough, you are more than just enough.
[time=766] Well what a privilege and what a joy, and I mean that, to get to be together this morning,
[time=782] I hope you have been as encouraged as I've been, being able to just take part in these first 30 or so minutes.
[time=789] I was asked recently, just the other day, while we were here at the Leadership Summit,
[time=795] what an amazing couple, two, three days we had, what a privilege to get to be together with so many.
[time=801] In fact, you can go out in the foyer today and look up on the rail, up above the balcony there, out in the foyer, look up, you can see over 25 churches and organizations that were here and a part of these last two and a half days as we gathered to be challenged and reminded again about the gift of leadership.
[time=817] And while I was there, somebody approached me and introduced themselves to me and just asked me, and I get asked it often.
[time=825] They asked me, why are you, why do you do, basically why do you do what you do?
[time=830] And I'm this person, this guy wanted to know why he watches the broadcast and has been around here somewhat and he said, and it wasn't just me, he said, you guys, it was like, you know, all of us around here, there's such, he said, there's such a passion that you seem to have for what you do.
[time=847] Why do you do what you do and not just why do you do it, but why do you do it the way you do it?
[time=854] And I didn't answer him this way the other day, but if I had been here this morning and
[time=860] heard what I just heard a few minutes ago, I would have said this to him.
[time=864] I would have said, because I know, I know from my own life's experience and I know from
[time=871] what I see going on around me every day, I know without a shadow of a doubt, nobody can ever convince me otherwise, it is the absolute truth.
[time=879] I know, why do I do what I do, why do we give ourselves to this ministry and the way that we give ourselves to it?
[time=885] I would have said to him, because I know that all other ground is sinking sand.
[time=896] You know that, right?
[time=898] You and I know in relationship with him that the ground marked Christ, the ground marked
[time=904] by a relationship, a fully surrendered relationship with him, that ground, and only that ground
[time=910] is solid, it's sound, it's firm.
[time=914] You and I are secure there and see there only.
[time=917] And so as we see it in the midst of all that we deal with and come across, you see much of it as well.
[time=923] All other ground is sinking.
[time=928] And so we, blessed by God and with hearts of gratitude for what God has not only done
[time=935] in us but what He's allowed us to be a part of here, we give ourselves to it and we give ourselves to it eagerly and with great passion and with great gratitude.
[time=943] And this morning we want to just come to you and take a Sunday and remind you, be reminded ourselves, Mitchell, Steve, and I, be reminded ourselves and do our very best to remind you why we, not just the three of us and not just our staff and those that give leadership, but why you and I, why we as a family are giving so much time and energy and effort to help
[time=966] seeking people, find and follow Christ.
[time=973] We mean that.
[time=974] That's a phrase.
[time=975] That's a statement.
[time=976] That means a great deal to us.
[time=977] It's right from the pages of Scripture and the great commission there in Matthew 28.
[time=981] And we have committed ourselves, you and I have, to do everything we can by His grace and for whose glory, His glory, to help seeking people, find and follow Christ and we want
[time=994] to just revisit that with you today.
[time=997] Before we begin though, I want to say this to you, this is really important I think that periodically we would as a family, just be able to say this, articulate what I feel like
[time=1008] God's kind of compelled us to say here this morning, here at the beginning.
[time=1011] I want to just say this to you, we're trying to do our best with God's help, to help seeking
[time=1018] people and I want to stop there and I want you to answer a question I'll just ask you.
[time=1025] Based upon your knowledge of me, based upon your understanding of my heart and the way
[time=1033] I come at this, based upon your understanding of these guys and our staff and the heart and spirit of this place, I think based upon the heart of God, how many seeking people
[time=1047] do you think we'd like to help?
[time=1051] What specific groups of seeking people do you think we're interested in trying to reach?
[time=1057] Anybody?
[time=1059] Say it louder.
[time=1060] [AMEN] Do you understand that, right?
[time=1065] And I think it's important for us to say this because you know, there is today in many circles and it's not a bad thing.
[time=1072] People will ask me, they'll say, hey Kelly, what's the niche that Blackhawk is after?
[time=1078] Like somebody asked me recently, what's your target audience?
[time=1082] And there are churches today and there's, I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with it.
[time=1086] You'll find churches today aimed at wanting to be a place that ministers to 20-something.
[time=1092] You'll find churches today aimed at wanting to minister to senior adults in a traditional setting.
[time=1097] Nothing wrong with that.
[time=1098] You'll find places wanting to kind of specifically minister to a certain ethnic group.
[time=1105] Nothing wrong with that.
[time=1106] Please understand that just in our hearts before God, we feel like He has led us to do
[time=1112] everything within our power by His grace and for His glory to help all, to help anybody,
[time=1121] to be a home and a place where anybody can come.
[time=1125] We want to be a place for the white and the black and the red and the brown and the yellow.
[time=1134] Doesn't matter.
[time=1135] It doesn't matter if you're educated or uneducated.
[time=1138] It doesn't matter if you're blue collar or white collar.
[time=1141] It doesn't matter if you're spiritually saved and secure or spiritually skeptical and still
[time=1147] trying to figure it out.
[time=1148] It doesn't matter if you're young or old or somewhere in between.
[time=1152] It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor or somewhere in that thing called middle class,
[time=1158] whatever that is.
[time=1160] It just doesn't matter to us.
[time=1163] We want to help all.
[time=1166] Know what it means to find Him and then follow.
[time=1170] Follow Christ.
[time=1171] And you see, that's the, that, my friends, that is so the way that sentence, the way that phrase ends, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=1181] I hope you don't ever forget.
[time=1184] I hope we're not ever to removed where we would lose sight of what a miracle that is.
[time=1190] I got a little removed in the last few days.
[time=1192] There have been so many things going on around here and I made my way back to my desk just the other day and it had been a while and there were a few more stacks than normal and I was looking through some things on my desk and found the sheet.
[time=1203] I think I had asked for it.
[time=1204] I'm not sure, but it was there and it had, it had baptism, still water.
[time=1210] August 21st, it's next week.
[time=1213] I think I had asked for a sheet and there was a sheet of paper with 54 names, 54 names.
[time=1223] And yeah, amen, praise God.
[time=1229] And I don't know how 54, I don't know how, as that rolled off my tongue, I don't know how that impacted you.
[time=1236] Shame on you and me if that ever wouldn't impact us, that 54 lives.
[time=1245] Think about it, 54 stories.
[time=1247] Think about it, 54 families, 54 neighborhoods, 54 workplaces, 54 young people and young adults
[time=1257] and moms and dads, don't ever, ever, you and I, we can't ever, ever lose sight of the miracle
[time=1264] of transformation that he lets us be a part of.
[time=1268] And so as we give ourselves to helping seekers find and follow Christ, we as a leadership.
[time=1274] God has let us and we've come before him again and again and said, "Oh God, please help us know what that would look like.
[time=1281] What would it look like for us to, as we give ourselves to this, what would it look like for you to be honored and for truth to be lifted up?
[time=1290] What is a follower of Christ?
[time=1295] What is that man or woman, boy or girl giving themselves to?" And I believe he could have led us to 12 things, he could have led us to two things.
[time=1304] He could have just landed at one, but he led us to five, I believe, five great truths,
[time=1310] I've great, you know, they're not just cute sayings, they're biblical principles, five ease, we call them, that you and I need to be aware of, that you and I need to be giving ourselves to, that you and I need to be growing in and so this morning, we come to just a
[time=1326] look at those five ease and just please open your Bibles, Romans 12 might be the first
[time=1332] place that we would turn to, Steve's going to start us out as he begins to take us through the framework, if you will, of this ministry that God has given us, our five E's and the first E being exaltation.
[time=1345] The framework of our ministry, that means it's the, the framework is the method by which we flesh out, work out what our mission and vision are to bring glory to God, reach the
[time=1357] loss that they might bring glory to God, that they might reach the lost and bring glory
[time=1364] to God.
[time=1365] And so exaltation, a life of worship, don't miss that, it's a life of worship.
[time=1373] It includes this 70 minutes that we have in here on Sunday morning, let's read that together,
[time=1379] it says this verse speaks of an entire life surrendered to him, Romans 12 does, our worship
[time=1385] extends beyond the 70 minutes on Sunday morning to every arena of life and our willingness
[time=1393] to offer him in those arenas, a living and holy sacrifice.
[time=1401] We often think of worship as that 35 minutes we just had, and believe me, I worship then,
[time=1409] and I'd like to worship then.
[time=1410] I enjoy collective worship, I bet the worship team knows that I like to worship.
[time=1416] I'll bet the musicians know that I like to worship him that way, because I'm engaged.
[time=1424] God is, I'm aware of God in that worship time when we sing together, and that's a great
[time=1432] time, and I do that not just with you, I love it when I'm with you, I do that sometimes in the car alone, I sing really loud then.
[time=1441] I worship to collectively with people, sometimes I've been in a van with junior high basketball, football players, and we sing those songs.
[time=1449] Sometimes I've done that in our little church that I grew up in, with that green hymnal,
[time=1455] and the piano that was out of tune, and matter of fact it had some of the plastic off of it, you know, and some of the keys didn't come back right away when you plucked them.
[time=1463] But we worshiped there, and across the street with organ and piano, and here, with organ,
[time=1469] now with all this, and I get to do that, there are lots of different styles that I can enjoy doing that.
[time=1474] I haven't bumped into the one yet that I can't do that in the form or the style.
[time=1480] There may be one, but for me it's been a treat, and not only have I been able to worship God in my singing with people, but there's something that mysterious happens, something mysterious
[time=1490] really happens, when I worship Him collectively with you, I get energized.
[time=1497] And that's an emotional experience that I have, I'm sure that's part of it, but part of it is I'm energized, and I'm ready to go out and do my worship the rest of the week
[time=1507] because I've collectively gathered with you and been taught the word and empowered by the word, and the Holy Spirit gets fed in me and I get filled up by the Spirit, and I leave here and I'm energized, and that's a mystery.
[time=1519] I don't know how that happens, but man I like it.
[time=1522] But then I have an opportunity to Monday through Saturday, do what Romans 12, 1 says.
[time=1530] It says I urge you, Paul says I urge you.
[time=1533] It's like he's taken a prod and he's jabbing you with that thing.
[time=1537] He says I really want you to do this.
[time=1539] I urge you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, we're able to do this by His mercy
[time=1545] and His mercy only, to present your bodies as living and holy sacrifice.
[time=1552] You're supposed to present your body as a living and holy.
[time=1555] A lot of people will lay their life down for people and die for them.
[time=1559] I find men that I counsel in marriage counseling, they're willing to do that.
[time=1564] They just won't live for their wives and their children.
[time=1567] God wants us to present our bodies living as sacrifices to Him.
[time=1572] Acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=1579] I get to worship God, so I brought this prop in just to head and answer to go up and get this calendar.
[time=1584] This isn't the one we use all the time, but this calendar has pretty pictures on it all over and it has 28 to 31 days a month.
[time=1591] Some years have 365, most of them do.
[time=1594] Some years have 366 in leap year and those are opportunities for us and I just want you to think about this, are you presenting your body as a living sacrifice Monday through
[time=1605] Saturday and Sunday?
[time=1608] Because that's what God wants.
[time=1610] He wants us to offer ourselves to Him as a spiritual act of worship, to bring Him glory
[time=1618] that He deserves.
[time=1621] In John 4, 24, Jesus interacting with the woman at the well, He says, "One day you'll worship in spirit and truth." We get to act upon that.
[time=1631] We get to look at the Word and worship Him in truth and we get to experience what the Holy Spirit is doing in us and we worship Him in spirit and truth.
[time=1639] I think perhaps the greatest act of worship you might do this week would be the time that
[time=1645] you're all alone and perhaps it's just that you're taking a thought captive and you're
[time=1652] saying, "O medians to you, oh God, Creator and Sustainer of this universe, Redeemer of
[time=1658] my soul." I'm going to take that thought captive and I'm not going to go there.
[time=1664] I'm going to think on pure and noble things like it says in Philippians.
[time=1667] I'm going to quote your Word back to you, acts of worship.
[time=1672] Are you doing those all week long?
[time=1675] I hope so.
[time=1676] That's what we are about.
[time=1677] The temptation of Blackhawk is about that, a life of worship.
[time=1682] Let me just say this about Steve and about many others I know in this family.
[time=1687] Hear me.
[time=1688] I believe that when someone is given to a life of worship versus a morning of worship, I believe
[time=1697] those that give themselves to a life of worship are those who for the past 30, 40 years haven't
[time=1705] met a worship style yet that they don't like.
[time=1709] Does that make sense?
[time=1712] I think those who make a big deal about it, those who want to fight about it, those who
[time=1718] want to make an issue of it, think sometimes those folks tend to be folks who see worship as a 35-minute deal.
[time=1726] And I've seen in this guy's life, I've seen him live a life of worship, a relationship with the Lord, lived out some good days, some bad days, but a genuine growing relationship
[time=1737] with him that then allows the work of God in his heart to hear organs and hymnals 30
[time=1744] years ago and drums and guitars today and hit not make a hill of beans difference.
[time=1752] It's just worship.
[time=1753] Does that make sense?
[time=1754] It's a good thing.
[time=1758] E, E number two evangelism.
[time=1760] E number two is evangelism and the first step in evangelism is not toward a lost and hurting world, but it's toward Jesus Christ.
[time=1768] And that's why exaltation comes first and that's what this verse says.
[time=1774] Verse Peter 3.15, "But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts."
[time=1783] He's always being ready to make a defense, or give an answer, to everyone who asks you
[time=1795] to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.
[time=1803] Every encounter is a divine appointment when in your heart you set apart Christ as Lord.
[time=1811] You commit to view each and every encounter as a divine appointment and regardless of how long or how short they are, they're an opportunity to reveal Christ.
[time=1824] This verse, 1 Peter 3.15, Peter understood the God of Second Chances is about three things
[time=1833] and I'm going to focus mainly on one, but if you want to write them down it's about connecting with the light, I brought a flashlight as a prop.
[time=1843] Connecting with the light, I connect with the light when I set apart in my heart Christ as Lord.
[time=1849] Light is a metaphor throughout the Bible to represent spiritual vitality, life.
[time=1856] And the life in my spirit happens when I surrender my heart to Christ as Lord.
[time=1861] And this little spark, John 1, 9, of a spirit that Christ put in every man, now it becomes a flame because I've humbled myself to Christ as Lord.
[time=1874] And so I connect with the light in order to reflect that light to others.
[time=1879] And then the spirit uses that to direct, connect, reflect, direct them to the reason for the
[time=1885] hope I have which is Christ as Lord.
[time=1888] I want to talk about that reflect, I want to talk about always being prepared to have an answer for anyone who asks, why would they ask?
[time=1896] Why would they ask?
[time=1906] They see something.
[time=1908] They see that you've connected with the spiritual vitality of life that they don't have.
[time=1916] And that came when you set apart in your heart Christ as Lord, your mind, your will, your emotions, your spirit, your thoughts, your choices, your feelings, your prayers are all
[time=1928] subjected to Christ as Lord.
[time=1930] And then you reflect that light to other people and they ask and they say, why?
[time=1937] Jesus said it this way in the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1941] He said, you are the light of the world because you've surrendered your life and your heart to me as Lord.
[time=1947] You are the light of the world.
[time=1950] Now go reflect that light.
[time=1951] Don't hide it under a bushel like we grew up singing in church.
[time=1955] Hide it under a bushel, no.
[time=1958] I'm going to let it shine.
[time=1960] You see Jesus Christ command you into me.
[time=1964] It's not to be the light you already are.
[time=1967] If you have set apart Christ as Lord, but don't hide the light.
[time=1973] And your pride will hide the light.
[time=1977] My girls and I were in our car and I watched some people pass by and now the group of people
[time=1983] and just ignore them.
[time=1987] And I told them this lesson that I want to share with you right now.
[time=1989] This is all I'm going to ask you to do and how to reflect the light.
[time=1991] I want you to write it down, notice, notice those around me.
[time=1996] Write it down, notice, write it down, notice those around me.
[time=2003] And I said, don't you ever walk by another human being made in God's image and ignore
[time=2011] that person.
[time=2012] Don't you ever not notice that person.
[time=2016] They were made in God's image.
[time=2017] And I said, you know, how am I going to notice them?
[time=2019] I said, lock eyes with them, smile.
[time=2021] If there's time, ask them about their day, find out who they are, but don't you ever
[time=2027] over the course of your life be characterized and known by ignoring other people.
[time=2032] You notice them and I'm asking you today that in every encounter you have with another human
[time=2038] being for the rest of your life, that you would reflect the light of Christ, the heartbeat
[time=2044] and the spiritual vitality of life of Christ who values the life he created.
[time=2050] And if you would notice those around you, if you would lock eyes with them, if you would smile at them, and here's what I found.
[time=2059] That every encounter does become a divine appointment that I've already connected.
[time=2063] I'm reflected and I'm part of the spirit directing them to Christ.
[time=2067] But when I notice those people, when I help seekers find and follow Christ, I find and
[time=2076] follow Christ, notice people.
[time=2082] [AMEN] One of the greatest, I believe one of the greatest blessings, one of the greatest joys
[time=2092] when someone comes to faith in Christ, it happened with me, it's happened with these two guys, I know hundreds of you that would say the very same thing.
[time=2100] One of the greatest joys in coming to know Christ is the privilege he allows us to live
[time=2106] in relationship with him, in relationship with others.
[time=2111] It's called community.
[time=2114] It is this privilege that we get to live life together.
[time=2120] And I want to just illustrate this for you this way today.
[time=2122] You know, most of you know me and you know I love people.
[time=2127] I love all kinds of people.
[time=2129] I love them.
[time=2130] I love about everything except cats, but we've already talked about that.
[time=2133] So I love people, so don't anybody feel left out here, but I have a growing, maybe it's
[time=2140] my stage of life.
[time=2141] I would admit that, but I have a growing passion and a deepening concern and a great, great
[time=2147] love for our young people, for students, for this world that they face and this challenge
[time=2155] that they have encountered in trying to live as younger Christ followers in a world that's
[time=2161] absolutely bent against that.
[time=2165] And so I want to just make sure that we look at this 30.
[time=2167] It's called encouragement.
[time=2169] And I want to just have you look at it and we'll just do it just with an example and then we're going to move on.
[time=2174] Okay, let me ask you four right here if you would mind.
[time=2176] I'm sorry, but just come up.
[time=2178] I think we've got Casey, Connor, Nate, right?
[time=2181] And Nick.
[time=2182] Awesome.
[time=2183] Two, four for four.
[time=2184] It was on the spot there.
[time=2185] We got him.
[time=2186] Come on up, you four.
[time=2187] I want you to look at it this way.
[time=2189] It's one more.
[time=2192] Actually we need one more.
[time=2193] Wesley, come up here and help us real quick.
[time=2197] Cassie, come over here.
[time=2198] Nick, stand right there.
[time=2200] Connor, stand in the front up here.
[time=2202] Wesley, come stand right here in the middle and Nate, back here in the back.
[time=2206] Okay.
[time=2206] Right in the middle.
[time=2208] Okay.
[time=2208] You guys squeeze in here.
[time=2210] Okay.
[time=2210] Back up one step.
[time=2212] Connor, right there.
[time=2212] Nate.
[time=2214] Okay.
[time=2214] All right.
[time=2216] Here's the deal.
[time=2216] Ecclesiastes.
[time=2218] Four.
[time=2218] And if one can overpower him who is alone, it's a rhetorical question.
[time=2226] Let me just ask you, can, can one, namely the evil one, can one overpower him or her
[time=2234] who is alone?
[time=2236] Yes or no?
[time=2237] Yeah.
[time=2238] The visual example would be this.
[time=2240] Wesley, she's in there.
[time=2241] Wesley, poke your head out there.
[time=2242] Can you see Wesley?
[time=2243] There she is.
[time=2245] Wesley.
[time=2246] Do you love the Lord, Wesley?
[time=2248] Yep, she loves the Lord.
[time=2249] Are you doing your best to try and follow him?
[time=2252] Doing her very best.
[time=2252] I can attest to that.
[time=2254] She's a good girl.
[time=2254] She's doing her very best.
[time=2257] There are times when that's hard though.
[time=2259] There are times when that doesn't go so well for a nine-year-old girl as well as with a 42-year-old dad, as well as with you, amen?
[time=2269] Sometimes that's a struggle.
[time=2271] And so Wesley or me or you in this position right here sees she is surrounded by, she
[time=2277] has chosen to join a small group.
[time=2280] She has chosen to develop friendships that she can actually share her life with and they love her and she loves them.
[time=2287] And so what happens literally and figuratively is that everybody decides that we're going to get through this to what?
[time=2295] Together.
[time=2297] And when Wesley chooses to live in community, when she chooses to live in honest, open,
[time=2304] accountable relationship, one cannot overpower her because she is not what?
[time=2310] Alone.
[time=2311] I'll tell you what though.
[time=2312] The day you are I, the moment you are I, the moment Wesley would or you would choose to
[time=2318] come out here and say, "Hey, you know what, I think I'm going to go it alone." Well then you know and I know that once we state our love for the Lord and our commitment to honor Him, we become targets, targets of the enemy.
[time=2332] And when it's like the briquette in the barbecue deal and the grill you know where you have the pile of briquettes and you throw the lighter fluid on and you light it and they all get wide around the edges and then they get red and then they're just absolutely hot, right?
[time=2347] That's this right here.
[time=2348] This is a pile of briquettes absolutely flaming, effective doing what they were meant to do
[time=2355] together.
[time=2356] You take one of those little briquettes, sorry, sweetie, you take one of those little briquettes, you're glad it's her, and you remove it from the pile, take a little some tongs and you just take that hot red hot briquette and you put it over here on the side, 20 minutes it's what?
[time=2370] It's out.
[time=2371] It's dead.
[time=2372] It's cold.
[time=2373] It's useless.
[time=2377] God didn't design us to live this way.
[time=2378] Now you know what, sometimes it's not Wesley, it's Nick.
[time=2382] Sometimes Nick's in the middle going, "Hey, you know what, I need some help.
[time=2384] I need some prayer.
[time=2386] I need some reminders.
[time=2387] I need some encouragement." And some days Nick's great and it's Nate.
[time=2390] Nate's in the middle going, "Hey, I need your help.
[time=2394] Here's what's going on.
[time=2395] Here's how he's tempting me.
[time=2396] Would you pray for me?
[time=2397] Would you call me tonight?" And then again tomorrow.
[time=2402] And when he's surrounded, there's strength.
[time=2405] When he's alone, he's toast.
[time=2408] It's not going to happen.
[time=2410] Thanks you guys.
[time=2411] Give him a big hand.
[time=2418] You can have that right there.
[time=2423] You just, you and I just need to say, "You know what, I need that." And we have opportunities for that.
[time=2429] There are home groups, there are classes, there are people in this community that would
[time=2435] love to welcome you in or would love to form that with you.
[time=2439] We could help move you in that direction if you'll ask, if you'll write me a note or make your Steve, if you'll come talk to us, if you'll call the church during the week, we can do our best to move you toward encouragement, community, not being alone.
[time=2454] Young, middle-aged, old, red, yellow, black and white, rich, poor, educated, uneducated,
[time=2462] it doesn't matter.
[time=2464] We got to live together.
[time=2466] Amen?
[time=2467] Number four, equipping.
[time=2468] Oh wait.
[time=2469] Don't you think pretty much all of these are to be done in community?
[time=2472] Absolutely.
[time=2473] Patient evangelism, equipping, excellent stewardship, all of our Es, absolutely well said, need
[time=2480] to be done.
[time=2481] We believe, should be done in community with each other.
[time=2486] Well equipping is being clearly taught to uniquely serve, clearly taught to uniquely
[time=2493] serve.
[time=2494] And equipping takes place in lots of different arenas.
[time=2497] I would have been equipped in a group setting just like he was describing right there.
[time=2502] I was equipped in Sunday school classes.
[time=2504] I've been equipped in my ABFs over the years, in small groups, in men's ministry, in women's
[time=2511] ministry, women get equipped around here, in legacy people get equipped, all kinds of ways we get equipped here.
[time=2517] I've been equipped by my senior pastors for all these years.
[time=2521] And they faithfully broke open the word and taught me the truth about the tool and the
[time=2528] tools that are in here.
[time=2530] The tool of the word and the tools, the principles that are in there.
[time=2537] And they faithfully taught me and I listened and then I'd try to do what I was taught.
[time=2542] And I'd try to do that in my unique way, clearly taught to uniquely serve.
[time=2548] Every single person in the room has unique opportunities for service because nobody can
[time=2559] serve the way you do, but you, you're the only one.
[time=2565] And we value that so much and we don't even know, we don't even know every unique opportunity
[time=2572] of service that should be out there for you.
[time=2575] But if you get engaged in the process and you become the servant, we'll discover it.
[time=2583] Because you're the one that can do it.
[time=2585] And I was equipped, you know, Mitchell was talking about a guy that people that would notice other people, I was noticed by somebody.
[time=2593] I was noticed by a man that looked me in the eye, made me feel like I had worth.
[time=2601] And then he, having been equipped by his pastor in Philadelphia and by the college professors
[time=2611] that he had at Grace College.
[time=2614] And by the brothers and sisters in Christ that he'd been around for years.
[time=2618] Having been equipped, he started equipping me.
[time=2621] And he, I brought this because, you know, you need to understand there are tools that we need to use.
[time=2627] I also brought this because Kelly jerked me around with that thing so much the last two weeks ago at Shepherd's Crook, I thought, a hammer, I don't know if you've ever been
[time=2639] taught how to use a hammer.
[time=2641] But before there were forklifts that put the shingles on the roof and you carried shingles
[time=2650] up on your shoulders, up the ladder to roof a house or a building.
[time=2656] I remember that.
[time=2657] Do you really?
[time=2658] With your hammer.
[time=2659] Yeah.
[time=2660] He had a little toy hammer that he used.
[time=2664] And before there were air nailers that stapled or nailed the roof on it, guys used hammers.
[time=2673] And on their forget, the guy that taught me how to use a hammer on a roof, he said, "What you want to do is find the hammer that's exactly the right weight and exactly the right length
[time=2684] so you can tap it once and hit it once.
[time=2690] Tap that roofing nail once to line it up and get it in there and then hit it once.
[time=2694] If your nail, if your hammer's really heavy, oh, it'll hit it once and it'll matter of fact, it'll put a hole through the shingle.
[time=2701] So you got to find the right weight.
[time=2703] As a matter of fact, that heavy one, you won't be swinging that all day, believe me.
[time=2706] So you find the right one.
[time=2708] The tools, there are right tools.
[time=2710] This is the right tool.
[time=2712] This is the right tool for you to learn the principles to live by.
[time=2715] It's the right weight.
[time=2718] You'll learn something unique to you about how to serve if you learn the tools that are
[time=2724] in here.
[time=2726] And he was faithful, Bill was faithful to teach me.
[time=2729] He took me to his house to paint his house and we talked about the word.
[time=2736] We did all kinds of jobs at his house.
[time=2737] I often thought about that afterward.
[time=2741] I learned from him at his house doing his work, Tom Sawyer kind of deal.
[time=2749] But you know what?
[time=2750] I loved it.
[time=2753] I remember Freeborn and I trying to hang drywall for this guy.
[time=2756] We didn't know what we were doing.
[time=2759] It took about four sheets to get that electrical receptacle little hole cut in the right spot.
[time=2765] But we learned the principles of the Word of God because he was faithful to teach us all the time.
[time=2771] Now are you, are you being equipped?
[time=2775] And he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the
[time=2785] building up of the body of Christ.
[time=2788] You are to be uniquely equipped to build up the body by service.
[time=2796] I hope you value it, we value equipping.
[time=2801] So much so that we're going to actually, some folks have been asking and I won't say too much about it this morning but beginning in September, September 18th we'll kick off the new ministry year, the new fall season with a six week series entitled A Life Beyond
[time=2818] You.
[time=2821] Because there is one, isn't there?
[time=2823] There is quite a life that God has called us to and it goes way beyond ourselves.
[time=2829] It's a life of service, it's a life of servanthood, it's a life of giving yourself away in all
[time=2836] kinds of ways and we're going to take about six weeks and we are going to, and we're going to do it all across this entire place with kids, with students, with adults in our worship times here we're going to teach about six weeks on serving and the joy and the beauty that comes when the body of Christ, everybody gives themselves the unique service.
[time=2856] Little plug there, sorry, right there, thanks.
[time=2859] The fifth E is excellent stewardship, it really ties into what Kelly said, it's a life
[time=2865] beyond me.
[time=2870] Our text says where your treasure is, there your heart will be also, there your heart
[time=2879] will be also, it's interesting that Jesus tells us that our hearts are inextricably
[time=2889] linked to what we value and so anybody seeing the movie Titanic?
[time=2896] Raise your hand if you've seen the movie Titanic.
[time=2898] How many people, when she fires that thing in the water at the end of the already jump out of your seat, I got out of my seat and said, no, what, I leaned in my wife, I said, you know what, that would be worth today, you know.
[time=2908] And we talk about it and I got this little replica of that necklace that she had that
[time=2914] was an interesting piece to the plot there and it's interesting, it's got treasures in a heart and I want you to remember that your heart is inextricably linked to that which
[time=2928] you value to your treasure and we take this from a context where Jesus is talking about
[time=2936] you either store up your treasures in heaven, that would be relationships or you store up your treasures on earth, that would be remuneration, either store up your treasures in heaven,
[time=2946] that would be people or you store up your treasures on earth, that would be profit.
[time=2952] And so life, like Kelly said, is either about others and about God or it's about me and Jesus says for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also, you're valuing what's
[time=2964] in your heart and we talk about giving T3 back to God, giving T3 back to God, that's
[time=2971] our time, our talent and our treasures, our time, our talent and our treasures, it's interesting,
[time=2980] those are the three gifts God gave us in the garden, gave us time, gave us talent, gave
[time=2987] us treasures. And the first sin, the first sin is to try to store that up on earth and
[time=2995] to make it all about me. Well you know, this has been a tough one for me in general. I
[time=3004] owned a business and how do you give out of that? Sometimes you know you're losing money
[time=3010] the next nine months, what are you going to do? You invest in the marketplace, sometimes the market goes up, sometimes it goes down, there are realized gains and realized losses,
[time=3020] there are unrealized gains and unrealized losses, it's complicated. Long time ago, years and years ago, I thought, you know what, I'll try this Thai thing because my uncle was meeting
[time=3031] with me, he was discipling me and he said, Mike of three says test God, God says test
[time=3038] him out. You know, I read that, I'm reading through the Bible with some guys, four chapters a day and if you're doing that, you blew through Mike of three a few days ago and it says that
[time=3049] you've turned your heart from me. And if you want to know how to turn your heart back to me, God says, just start giving your treasures and see what happens. I think back to that
[time=3062] little experiment I did years and years ago where I would give, I decided I would give 10% of any increase that came my way and I just write that check and I tell you what, because I was writing that check, I felt free from the bondage that possessions can have on me because that's the way one of the things I've struggled with. But after several weeks
[time=3082] of doing that, I thought, man, I don't care how you slice it, that ends up being a lot of money to anybody for anything. That's a lot. Well, I'll think about that later. And
[time=3094] I left it. My heart was hard. My heart was to store up treasures on earth. To one day
[time=3105] I didn't have any. All gone. On a very bad day, I got on my knees and he reminded me
[time=3112] ironically that it was not worth nothing, worth less than nothing. I said to God, you could have my business. I want to make it a ministry. God, I'm going to try something different though. Instead of giving you a percentage of my time, my talent, my treasures, I want
[time=3128] to give it all. And that change in my heart changed my perspective of life. And it's really
[time=3137] interesting. I started giving part of my treasures as I could. I owed so much money to people who expected to get paid that I paid them at the rate of tithing with the spirit of tithing.
[time=3148] But I started thinking about, well, what about my talent? What about the gifts that God's given me and using those for God? Am I doing that? What about my time, 24/7, 168 hours a week? Am I using that for God? You know, there's a verse in Ecclesiastes I love. It's
[time=3162] 7-12. I'm going to use it in an upcoming talk with marketplace leaders. And it says this,
[time=3170] wisdom and money are both a shelter. But wisdom will preserve your soul forever. And I'm telling
[time=3181] you, if you move from storing up treasures on earth to storing up treasures in heaven, something's going to happen to you. I prayed to God. I said, God, I got nothing to seek anymore. I've lost it all. I just want to seek your wisdom. And my life has dramatically changed by seeking the wisdom of God. I'll close it this way. I want you to just -- here's what exactly what I want you to do. I want you to pray that prayer. God, what if I would give all? Pray it all this week, pray it for a month, whatever it takes for the spirit to work in your lives. God, what if I give all? All my time, all my talent, all my -- what's that look like? All my time, all my talent, all my treasures. I think this. I think wisdom,
[time=3219] let me say it this way first. I think money is pride's measurement of our time, talent
[time=3225] and treasures. Money is pride's measurement, that hard heart of our time, talent and treasures
[time=3231] of our giftedness. Money is pride's measurement of our giftedness, but wisdom. Wisdom is humility's
[time=3242] measurement of our godliness. It's good. It's good. It's good. So boy, five really, really
[time=3257] sound truths that we as a family have said. You've all at one point or another for the
[time=3264] most part. You've all knotted your heads back and said we're in. And we're doing our very
[time=3270] best to provide you with opportunities to grow in these arenas. And we want to help
[time=3276] you continue to do that. And so please let us know how we can, all of you, remember all
[time=3283] of you. And I'm so grateful. I know Mitchell and Steve are as well, so very thankful for
[time=3289] the family that you are to us, the way that you give yourself to so much of this. But
[time=3295] we know you need help just like we know we do. We know that there is growth still to take
[time=3302] place in your heart, in your fully surrendered relationship with him. And so we would just
[time=3308] hope and pray. It would be our hope and our prayer that you would be a family that would continue, continue to live lives of worship. And where you fall short, please ask for help.
[time=3321] That you would be a family that would truly see every encounter as a divine appointment.
[time=3325] And where you need help doing that, where you need help and encouragement, knowing how to do that in a way that makes more sense, to do that in a way that's more genuine, to do
[time=3336] that in a way whereby you can give the answers for the hope that is in you. If you need some help with that, let us know. We'll help you. If you need a small group, let us know. We
[time=3348] want to help you be connected to live life and community. Equipping. I think about men and power equipment. Guys, you should be, there's two power equipment, Bible studies. One early in the morning, one in the evening, on Thursdays, you should go. You should stop at nothing to go and be in a Bible study where the truth of God can reach in and change your heart and life. And women, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, there's women's Bible studies. There's Sunday mornings. I hope you don't ever take this time lightly. Be equipped so that you can,
[time=3378] you see in the, like you see in the bulletin today, you see an opportunity with kids. You see a chance to give back. You see a chance to serve. You see a chance to teach or do
[time=3389] the arts or tell stories or just help. Do it. Give back. And then you're giving in your
[time=3397] stewardship. We've said, Mitch, he just said it so well. I pray that you would be willing to give back. I pray that every, you may make a hundred bucks a week. You may make a thousand bucks. It doesn't matter. We're talking about a heart. We're not talking amounts here. We're talking about a heart that says, God, I am going to sacrificially and on a regular basis,
[time=3418] give back to you. And you do with it what you will. It could take that crown course coming
[time=3424] up. Crown. That's right. Those of you wanting to better understand kind of a biblical approach to finances and stewardship and giving. You see it right there in your bulletin today.
[time=3433] You can sign up and be a part of a crown ministry group that will help you think all that through train you and equip you to do that well. So thankful we're in this together. Amen? Let's
[time=3444] stand and pray, shall we? God, we stand before you this morning with humble hearts. So grateful
[time=3451] for a family like this, God, for a ministry like this that you've allowed us to be a part of. We know you didn't have to do it this way, but you did. So God, give us grace and strength and courage to continue to give ourselves to these truths. And God, bring more and more
[time=3466] people that we can share in this journey with. God, thank you for the relationships that you've
[time=3472] given us. God, I pray that we would leave this place today, ready in our hearts and minds
[time=3478] and souls to honor you, to bring great glory to you, to magnify you. God, we love you and
[time=3486] we pray that you will be with us. We pray that you will strengthen us as we give ourselves to these five E's in your son's name. We pray. Amen.
