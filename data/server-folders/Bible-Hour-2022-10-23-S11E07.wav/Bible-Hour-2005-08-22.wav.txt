[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=52] and on earth. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name
[time=63] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=74] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to
[time=80] the end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=91] Hi, I am Kelly Bird and it is a privilege and joy again to welcome you to the Bible hour
[time=103] and it is a real joy to be able to just share with you each and every week some of the things
[time=109] that God is doing, some of the things that I have the privilege of being a part of.
[time=113] I do my best as Steve and Mitch whenever they're here.
[time=117] We just want to try to communicate to you the things that we're so blessed to be a part
[time=123] of, things that are so encouraging to us.
[time=126] And I got to tell you today, I am spiritually personally, I'm just about as encouraged as
[time=133] I could ever be.
[time=134] Just this last Sunday, we had a wonderful time, just a really special time of worship and teaching
[time=141] from God's Word, you'll see that today.
[time=143] But then last Sunday evening, I'm telling you, we were out at the lake where we typically go at the Stillwater facility and we saw about 60 people, 60, step into the waters of baptism.
[time=158] These are folks, kids, students, young adults, older adults, we saw about 60 people step
[time=165] into the water, people who had recently fully surrendered their hearts and lives to Christ.
[time=171] And we were able to have a time of communion and we were able to have a time of worship and then we took, it took a couple hours.
[time=177] We were there late, just getting people wet, dunking them in the pond, hearing their stories
[time=183] of life change and conversion and I'm telling you, there is absolutely nothing like it.
[time=190] I watch all that, I see all that, I hear all of their stories and I just get so thankful for what God allows us to be a part of here.
[time=198] But I want to tell you something, those 20 to 25 stories have their spiritual beginnings right here on the Bible Hour.
[time=205] I heard it time and time again, people standing there, young, old and between, saying that God began to move them toward faith as they would get up on Sunday mornings and watch
[time=216] church at seven o'clock.
[time=218] It just continues to bottle my mind.
[time=222] God uses His truth, He uses the worship and the praise of Christ followers and He uses
[time=229] the teaching of His Word to captivate and draw the hearts of people closer and closer to Him.
[time=235] And here's what I want to say this morning to you.
[time=238] Those folks ended up in that water that night being baptized, fully committing their hearts
[time=244] and lives to Him.
[time=245] I wonder where you are, I wonder how many of you are out there and the beginnings of your
[time=251] spiritual journey are taking place right now.
[time=254] You tune in week after week and you have questions about life and you're confused about faith and maybe somewhere along the line you've got a distorted picture of God but you watch
[time=264] the broadcast and maybe for you it's becoming clearer and clearer.
[time=269] Well I just want you to know how much we care about you, how interested we are in doing our best to encourage and teach you the truth about God's Word.
[time=279] And so I want to just say this to you, so many of these folks that were baptized who had their spiritual beginnings right here in the Bible Hour, each one of them talked about the day, they finally just got up, got in the car and came and experienced all of
[time=293] this live and in person and it gave them a chance to meet us and it gave us a chance to meet them and you know what I want to just keep inviting you, come.
[time=302] Come and be with us, 9 o'clock, 1045 on Sundays, 645 on Wednesday nights, common ground with
[time=309] Dr. Mitchell Cruz, we would love to meet you and we would love to do our part in helping
[time=315] you continue on your spiritual journey.
[time=318] Hey don't forget September 9th, Friday night we'd love for you to come and join us.
[time=322] We are so looking forward to meeting many of you whom we've never had the privilege of meeting, call the church office at 4937400, hit extension 450 or go on our website to
[time=335] blackhawkministries.org and click on an evening with Blackhawk.
[time=338] I've been talking to you about it for weeks, we have I think over 800 people currently
[time=344] registered to attend, it's going to be an amazing night of worship and time to gather Bill Hybels from Willow Creek Community Church is going to be there that night and we want you to join us down at the Grand Wayne Center for a huge night, our vision night.
[time=357] It's a night where we're going to kick off a new ministry year and we want you to join us.
[time=363] And then don't forget about Sunday, just two days later, September 11th, Sunday, we're going to celebrate 30 years of this right here, 30 years of the Bible hour and we want you to come, get a seat, come in there and join us that morning and we're going to give you a chance that morning to thank those who have faithfully brought this broadcast to you year after year after year and I know you'll want to be there that day to be a part of it.
[time=389] Hey, we love you and I mean that, we care about you and we want nothing more than to continue to encourage and help you in your spiritual journey.
[time=398] Thank you so much for tuning in and my hope and prayer is that we would meet you and see you soon.
[time=404] God bless you.
[time=406] [MUSIC]
[time=409] [MUSIC] Blessed be the name of the Lord [MUSIC] Blessed be your glorious name â™ª
[time=700] - Why don't you just remain standing?
[time=706] Let me pray for us and then we'll study God's word.
[time=709] Father God, we thank you so very much for the songs that we sing, the great truth that they represent.
[time=716] God, the message that they contain.
[time=719] And today we have sung about you.
[time=721] Today we have lifted our voices and proclamation and adoration of the great God, the only God, that we serve and love.
[time=729] God, we do love you and we have such respect for you
[time=735] and for your truth and we come to that this morning, God, we come to this book, these ancient words that are ever true.
[time=744] And we pray, God, that as we look again into these truths that you would grow us and change us and remind us and convict us.
[time=751] God, that you would do and your word would do what only it can do, that it can take people, flawed, sinful, hurting.
[time=760] God, you can take us, your word takes us.
[time=764] And it reminds us of what is true and right and good.
[time=768] It strengthens us to walk toward it.
[time=771] And God, we pray you would do that very thing today.
[time=775] Thank you for what it said there in Psalm 95 that when your name is proclaimed, when you are near people, people shout, they give acclimation, they announce the great things about you and we have done our best with your help, God, this morning to do that.
[time=792] We proclaim all that is good and right about you and we pray, God, that you would teach us and guide us in this time and your son's precious and holy name we pray.
[time=802] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=806] You can be seated.
[time=809] Well, last week, as many of you know, we took some time to revisit five very important truths, five very important principles, principles and truths that we live by around here at Blackhawk.
[time=822] We do our best to live by them.
[time=823] We do our best to model our ministry after them.
[time=826] We looked at our five Es.
[time=830] These five Es are biblical truths that help give us guidance in all that we do, all that we teach, all the ministry that takes place.
[time=837] And it's good once a year to just look back on those five things, to be reminded of how helpful they can be, how true they are, helps keep us kind of guided and on course, you call Blackhawk home and you weren't here last week, I would strongly encourage you to pick up a copy of the tape, get a CD, DVD of it, whatever you need.
[time=855] But look through that.
[time=856] And this morning I wanna just take some time, I just have kind of given these two weeks in our teaching schedule to remind us of something very, very fundamental.
[time=865] Not only the five truths that guide our ministry last week, but this week, what that should look like, what that should look like as it's happening it, and what that should look like in the end.
[time=882] I mean, when it's all said and done, what will they say about the ministry that God gave us here at Blackhawk?
[time=888] You and I know, especially in recent days, how important it is that we understand that this isn't just about us.
[time=895] This is about the church, big C, right?
[time=898] This is about other believers and other local fellowships and our effort to do all that we can, to be faithful with what God has given us here, but to also come alongside other churches and encourage and help them and all that God has given them to do.
[time=913] We're very committed to that these days, but at the same time we need to be who God has called us to be, and there needs to be an activity here in the hearts and souls of these people.
[time=924] You, me, this family, there needs to be a commitment, there needs to be an activity, there needs to be a mindset, the posture of our souls needs to be in a certain way so that we can be a church, a church that brings great honor and glory to him, a church that makes much of him.
[time=945] And so I bring you back today to one of the greatest pictures of that we could ever look at.
[time=953] I bring you back today to first Thessalonians chapter one.
[time=956] And if you brought your Bibles this morning, you can turn there if you don't.
[time=959] I'm sure you can look on with someone nearby.
[time=961] And I wanna remind you today that there isn't anything more powerful, there isn't anything more important, there isn't anything more transforming and life-changing than the truth of God's word, the gospel of Christ, lived out in the life of a church.
[time=980] I look around this room this morning and I see face after face after face, individuals, families, couples, young people, old people.
[time=988] I look around this room today and I see like I see every week the stories of transformed lives, the stories of the unfolding, ongoing stories of life change, eternity is being altered right before our eyes, as God does his amazing miraculous work.
[time=1008] And I realize as I see you that that's because you're a part of, God has in his sovereignty and providence brought you to a place that is so much more than a place.
[time=1021] It is a living, breathing organism designed by God to do his life-changing work.
[time=1026] It's called the church.
[time=1027] And when the church is all that the church should be, when you and I as individuals and you and I corporately as a family are what God has called us to be.
[time=1038] Amazing things happen.
[time=1039] In 1 Thessalonians, Paul writes, he had been the pastor of this church.
[time=1044] He had first-hand experience with this body of believers.
[time=1048] Now he's a bit removed and they continue to be the people that God called them to be a fully surrendered community of Christ followers.
[time=1058] And he does an amazing thing.
[time=1059] God, through the pin of Paul, God gives us a picture of that church.
[time=1064] And it is that picture that we come back to today.
[time=1066] We're gonna just take some time and go through six, seven, eight, eight points, truths, characteristics of this church that serve for you and I today to be a great, I think, great God-honoring model.
[time=1081] You wanna be a church?
[time=1083] You wanna be a church that makes much of him?
[time=1086] You wanna be a church that is faithful to execute the mission that God has given us?
[time=1091] I do.
[time=1092] And I want you to continue to do what so many of you have been doing, you have been contributing in that direction and in that fashion.
[time=1101] This is a great chance for you and I, just to stop for a week and say, hey, how are we doing?
[time=1105] How are you doing individually?
[time=1108] How are we doing as a family?
[time=1110] The fully surrendered church.
[time=1113] Hey, bear with me here.
[time=1115] In honor of God's word would you stand again?
[time=1117] We've been standing and sitting a lot.
[time=1120] Let me just have you stand.
[time=1121] Let me read this for you.
[time=1122] First Thessalonians chapter one, Paul and Sylvanas and Timothy of the church of Thessalonians and God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1129] Grace to you and peace.
[time=1130] We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers, constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ and the presence of our God and Father.
[time=1145] They are so thankful because of what you're about to read.
[time=1148] Here are the characteristics of the fully surrendered church.
[time=1153] Knowing brethren beloved by God, his choice of you.
[time=1156] For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction.
[time=1164] Just as you know what kind of men we prove to be among you for your sake.
[time=1169] Verse six, you also became imitators of us and of the Lord having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in a Kia.
[time=1185] For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and a Kia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth so that we have no need to say anything for they themselves report about us, what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead.
[time=1214] That is Jesus who rescues us from the wrath to come.
[time=1218] God, we stand humbly before you and we ask that you would move and in through this truth to do with us personally and corporately as a body.
[time=1230] God, whatever it is you might need to do to help us be the church that you've called us to be.
[time=1235] We ask it in your son's name, amen.
[time=1238] You can be seated, here you go.
[time=1240] Some characteristics of a fully surrendered church.
[time=1245] Number one, I want you to write this down, a fully surrendered church speaks or proclaims a spirit-powered message.
[time=1254] Think about that, write that down, a fully surrendered church made up of fully surrendered Christ followers, a fully surrendered church, a God honoring church speaks, A, watch how I say this, speaks a spirit, a spirit-powered message.
[time=1272] A spirit-powered message in contrast to a what?
[time=1279] In contrast to a what-powered message?
[time=1282] Say it, a man-powered message.
[time=1287] Does that make sense?
[time=1290] And let me just tell you.
[time=1292] First, let me read this to you, and then I'll tell you.
[time=1295] A fully surrendered church speaks a spirit-powered message.
[time=1302] Now, while it is true that there needs to be, look what it says in the text here, for our gospel did not come to you, see first Thessalonians 1-5, our gospel did not come to you in what?
[time=1314] In word only, but also in power.
[time=1317] Now, everybody, I'm sure this makes sense to you.
[time=1320] The message had to come in word.
[time=1324] I mean, that's a message, right?
[time=1325] I mean, there has to be a word.
[time=1326] Somebody's got to speak.
[time=1329] There has to be a communicator for the message to exist.
[time=1333] So there had to be the word, the spoken word.
[time=1336] Look at Romans 10 real quick.
[time=1338] Go ahead and look at Romans 10.
[time=1340] Romans 10, 13 says, "For whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved." That's a wonderful truth.
[time=1346] Look at the next verse, "How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed?
[time=1351] How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard?
[time=1355] And how will they hear without a what?
[time=1358] A preacher." Now, we've had this conversation before.
[time=1362] We know as we've studied this text that the word there in the Greek preacher is not talking about me alone.
[time=1368] It's not talking about Pastor Mitch.
[time=1370] It's not talking about Steve.
[time=1371] It's not talking about the guy who stands in front of your class and teaches.
[time=1374] It's not just the shepherd who breaks open and communicates God's truth in your small group or small home community.
[time=1381] No, this is talking about anybody and everyone who would communicate the truth.
[time=1387] This is my friend's talking about you.
[time=1389] Welcome to the club.
[time=1390] As far as the Greek goes, you are a preacher.
[time=1393] Everybody who communicates the truth.
[time=1398] Mitch talked about it last week.
[time=1400] Your readiness and mine to make a defense for the hope that is in us in those spiritual conversations that we get to have as we do our best to represent what's true and right and good in the car, on the trip, on the bus with the neighbor, wherever you might be, when you open your mouth and communicate what's true, you preach according to the Greek.
[time=1422] And they won't hear unless you speak.
[time=1428] So there's gotta be a word.
[time=1431] And this is where it gets really interesting.
[time=1433] So there's gotta be a word and you and I have to speak, but it can't be you and I.
[time=1439] What?
[time=1440] Speaking.
[time=1441] It's gotta be him speaking
[time=1447] through your surrendered, humble, opened mouth and heart.
[time=1452] Paul was a great example of this.
[time=1459] There's gotta be the word, the spoken word, Romans.
[time=1462] But look what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2.
[time=1464] 1 Corinthians 2, four and five, write that down.
[time=1467] And my message, listen, Paul was remembering how he came to the church at Corinth and he was reminding them what that ministry looked like, what it was characterized by.
[time=1477] And he said, my message, the spoken word, my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit, spirit of God and of power.
[time=1489] Verse five says, so that your, this is why it's so important.
[time=1494] And you and I can probably think of places where we've seen this go the other way.
[time=1498] The way it was supposed to go is this way, so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of who?
[time=1505] Say it, men, I don't want you, I don't need you.
[time=1509] God didn't design all of this for you to somehow be resting on me.
[time=1514] No, he designed it for you to be resting on him so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God, amen?
[time=1523] Now, this is very, this can be very tricky
[time=1530] because you and I are so sinful and we're so broken and we're so flawed.
[time=1536] We've gotta speak, but it can't be us.
[time=1540] We gotta open our mouths, but it's gotta be him.
[time=1542] And we gotta make sure when we open our mouths and communicate we are doing so by the power provided by the Holy Spirit.
[time=1548] So I want you to write these three things down.
[time=1550] Just please write these three things down quickly as we go through here.
[time=1553] Number one, there cannot be, there cannot be in the communication process, you over your fence in the backyard, you in the car with the seeking friend, you had a relationship with for two years or me standing behind this pulpit, there cannot be a personal agenda.
[time=1570] There cannot be a personal agenda.
[time=1575] Do you know how freeing?
[time=1577] Do you know how freeing that is for me?
[time=1580] I could have some agendas.
[time=1585] There could be some things I would want to further, just like there might be some things you would want to further.
[time=1590] I might want this all to start looking a certain way.
[time=1593] There would be roads I might wanna travel down, but you know what helps me with all that is I'm just supposed to stand here and tell you about this.
[time=1601] That's what we're supposed to do.
[time=1603] We're supposed to stand there and tell you and communicate to you in a relevant, loving way, this.
[time=1609] No agenda, just the truth.
[time=1613] Truth spoken in what?
[time=1615] Love.
[time=1616] No personal agenda.
[time=1618] You wanna be a spirit-powered messenger?
[time=1621] You want this to be a spirit-powered place?
[time=1623] No agendas.
[time=1624] Secondly, write this down, deep connection.
[time=1626] Deep connection, a deep personal connection to him.
[time=1631] The New Testament in the book of John, John the Apostle, the disciple John, calls it being in an abiding relationship.
[time=1641] Look at John 15.
[time=1643] Says in Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, John 15.
[time=1648] I am the true vine, Jesus speaking here.
[time=1650] I am the true vine and my father is the vine dresser.
[time=1654] Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away and every branch that bears fruit reminds you of the fruit, the spirit, right?
[time=1665] Every branch that follows and honors, every branch that bears fruit, every branch that is spirit-filled, spirit-powered, he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.
[time=1678] You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
[time=1681] Here you go, verse four, abide in me and I in you.
[time=1686] As the branch cannot bear fruit, you can't be fruitful.
[time=1692] It can't go the way it was supposed to go.
[time=1695] It can't be a ministry that brings honor to him.
[time=1697] It can't be a message that he uses to change lives when it's not connected to in a very deep and abiding sense, it's not connected to him.
[time=1709] As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine.
[time=1713] So neither can you unless you abide in me.
[time=1720] My friends, there has got to be in my heart as I stand here before you.
[time=1724] There has got to be in your heart as you stand before anybody.
[time=1727] As we bring this message, that message has to come from individual hearts that are on a regular basis, getting up whenever you might have to get up.
[time=1736] How's that alarm treating you these days?
[time=1739] Staying up, however long you might need to stay up, taking 45 minutes or so and removing it from your busy day, which I know we all have, but just making the time to read him, to sing him, to listen to him, to meditate on him, to memorize him, this truth, and not just that 45 minutes or that hour, but then you and I together living lives of worship, deeply connected to him, filling our minds and our sights with that which is right and true and good, asking for help when we need it.
[time=1778] Deeply connected, no agenda, and actively, third thing I want you to write down, actively putting to death the deeds of the flesh.
[time=1788] Where do I get that?
[time=1789] Well, look at Romans eight.
[time=1790] As it relates to a spirit-empowered life, as it relates to a spirit-empowered ministry.
[time=1799] Look at Romans chapter eight, I think we'll pick it up in verse 12.
[time=1802] It says there in Romans eight, 12, so then brethren, Paul writing to the church at Rome, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh, for if you are, listen, here's a warning for you and for me, for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the spirit, but if by the spirit, you are putting to death the deeds of the flesh, the deeds of the body, you will live interesting phrase there.
[time=1832] If you are living according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the spirit, you, who's putting to death the deeds of the body?
[time=1842] Who, you and who?
[time=1846] See, it's always, there's always this thing going on.
[time=1851] There is the responsibility that you and I have to act, to put to death the deeds of the flesh, but we do that by the power of the, what, spirit.
[time=1863] And you have the power of the spirit, listen, here you go, you have the power of the spirit available to you in whatever situation you're in, when you live life without an agenda deeply connected, deeply connected to him, reading him, singing him, studying him, memorizing him, meditating on him.
[time=1882] Secondly, a fully surrendered church says,
[time=1888] as we go back to our first Thessalonians passage.
[time=1893] Paul knew it was a God honoring church, because it says there in the text, you also look at verse six, you also became imitators of us and of the Lord.
[time=1905] I want you to stop right there.
[time=1907] You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, the fully surrendered church, my friends, becomes a fully surrendered community of Christ followers.
[time=1919] They become imitators of the Lord.
[time=1924] And Paul says they became imitators of him.
[time=1927] Imitator, we've talked about this before.
[time=1930] Do you remember that phrase?
[time=1931] That's the, to imitate is the word in the Greek that means to mimic, raise your hand if you've ever been in a minivan SUV or car with two or three kids in the back seat, one of whom was imitating another.
[time=1946] Everybody understands that joyful, lovely, encounter, and it goes on and on.
[time=1952] And then the one says to the other, stop copying me and the one yells back, stop copying me.
[time=1956] I mean, everything that's said, every motion that's made, copied, that's the picture.
[time=1963] He says a good God honoring church, full of fully surrendered Christ followers.
[time=1970] We're becoming copycats.
[time=1972] We'd be mimicking him.
[time=1975] We'd do what he would have done.
[time=1976] We say what he would have said.
[time=1979] We think and we choose and we live.
[time=1982] It's a, it's just, it's a copy.
[time=1984] We just, we're gonna do what you would do.
[time=1986] And there's a part of that, my friends, that I resonate with and I understand the health of that.
[time=1993] You know what, there's a part of that that scares me to death.
[time=1996] You know what part of that scares me?
[time=2000] And I don't know how you would feel if you were in these, in these 13s.
[time=2005] Standing up here, just doing what I do.
[time=2007] But here's the part that scares me about that.
[time=2010] Look at 1 Corinthians 4, 16.
[time=2012] I think this is worth just talking about for a moment.
[time=2016] 1 Corinthians 4, 16, look at that screen.
[time=2019] You can turn there in your Bibles or you can look up at the screen.
[time=2022] I want you to look at this verse.
[time=2023] This is Paul, the Apostle, pastor, shepherd, teacher, leader.
[time=2027] And he says to the church at Corinth, he says, "Therefore, I exhort you." This is a strong word.
[time=2034] He is saying, "I really, really, really want you to do this.
[time=2039] I'm exhorting you." And having said that, he goes on to say, and you know what, I don't even want to read it.
[time=2047] Do you understand how scary that phrase is to me?
[time=2055] Any of you want to come up here?
[time=2058] Come on.
[time=2061] Somebody come up here and stand on this stage.
[time=2064] And say, "Hey, everybody, imitate me." Come on, line up.
[time=2072] Come on.
[time=2075] Who wants to do that?
[time=2079] I mean, we've been down this road before you and I.
[time=2084] And you know me, and I know you.
[time=2086] And you know me, it's not all, it's not all spit and polish.
[time=2091] It's not all as it should always be.
[time=2094] There's a human here, full of weakness and frailty and sin at times.
[time=2099] So I read that and I can get a little bit confused, but then you know what?
[time=2104] Then I start thinking it through this week.
[time=2106] And I think it has to do with what it is that you're imitating.
[time=2113] Well, you say, okay, well, let's go with that.
[time=2118] He obviously is trying to make a point that it's good to follow someone who's, it's good to follow someone who's good.
[time=2126] This is a positive thing.
[time=2127] Well, okay, so define good.
[time=2131] What is it that you want me to imitate?
[time=2134] And then as I think about that, and as I look at the life of Paul, hang with me here, this gets really encouraging.
[time=2143] I go from being a little discouraged, like wishing I could say that, to being kind of encouraged, 'cause I come back to Romans 7.
[time=2151] And I want you just to listen this morning to the words that this very same man Paul spoke from his heart as he wrote to the church at Rome.
[time=2160] This is the man who said, imitate me.
[time=2164] He says in Romans 7, and we'll pick it up in verse 15, for what I am doing, the choices I'm making, for what I am doing, I do not understand, for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.
[time=2183] But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the law confessing that the law is good, so now verse 17 no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
[time=2193] For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is in my flesh for the willing, the wanting to do good is present in me, raise your hand if you can identify with that.
[time=2204] You want to do right, keep your hands up.
[time=2207] And keep your hand up if you can identify with this.
[time=2213] But the doing of the good is not.
[time=2218] Yeah, see we live in that tension.
[time=2221] For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.
[time=2228] But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
[time=2234] Verse 24, wretched, wretched, sinful, lost,
[time=2240] broken, damaged, wretched, sick man, that I am.
[time=2248] That's what that word means, wretched man, that I am who will set me free from the body of this death.
[time=2258] Thanks be to verse 25, thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.
[time=2269] So I study Paul and look at Paul's life as I've done all these years.
[time=2274] And you know what I conclude about Paul?
[time=2277] I conclude about Paul that his life was a life undoubtedly full of confession.
[time=2284] And a life undoubtedly full of repentance,
[time=2291] confessing your sin, agreeing with God about it and confessing it to him.
[time=2298] Repentance, changing, him changing you, you making decisions and moving in a different direction.
[time=2305] I concluded his life was a life full of confession
[time=2311] for all of his wretchedness, a life full of repentance, moving away, and you're with me on this I know again and again and what, again, and a life of growth.
[time=2326] And because the confession and the repentance, it really does lead to growth and it's painful growth, it's challenging growth at times.
[time=2334] So I believe that if what we're gonna imitate is that,
[time=2341] and I would call that authenticity, that's what you want me to stand here and be able to say,
[time=2352] if you want me to be able to say, hey, imitate me, the only way I can ever get my arms around that, and I bet the only way you could ever get your arms around that is if what we're saying is, let's be real, be authentic.
[time=2366] And I'm okay with saying and be holy and righteous
[time=2373] and God honoring, I'm okay with that as long as we understand that the bar is at authentic.
[time=2380] Amen?
[time=2384] Imitate him, my friends.
[time=2386] Let's imitate him together and let's do it honestly.
[time=2389] Number three, a fully surrendered church.
[time=2391] A fully surrendered community of Christ followers receives the word in hardship, I love this.
[time=2398] Go back to 1 Thessalonians one.
[time=2400] The fully surrendered church, it has a habit, it has a pattern, people who are a part of a God honoring family from what Paul says here, they receive the word of God in hardship.
[time=2413] I want to take that phrase if I can, let's divide that phrase in half.
[time=2417] I want you just to look up there at the screen kind of mentally draw a line, put a slash after word.
[time=2423] And I want to just remind us this morning that as fully surrendered followers of Christ, people trying with His help and by His grace to live in a life-changing relationship with Him.
[time=2435] If we're going to be that individually, and if as a church we are going to be known and marked by that, we have got to be a people who receive the word.
[time=2446] And I don't want to sound old school here, I don't want to sound like your dad, I don't want to sound like I've got a finger wagging in your face because I don't, I just don't know how else to say this, sometimes I just want to shout it from the nearest mountain top.
[time=2464] Hey everybody, you've got to go to church.
[time=2471] You've got to put yourself on a regular basis in a living room with those who are a part of your community, your small group, in a class with those folks you know and love in the sanctuary where we come gathered as the body, in that men's Bible study, in that women's Bible study.
[time=2493] And I'm not saying do it because that's what good Christians do, I'm saying you got to do it because you and I need it to live, you and I need it to survive, you and I need it to grow, you have got to receive the word, this word that cuts deep and moves into the most private personal parts of your heart and soul and life and it teaches you and it convicts you and it enlightens you and it changes you and you don't get any of that conviction, enlightenment or change if you don't receive it.
[time=2529] It meant so much to him that he gifted certain people to teach it so that you could receive it and so that it could do its work in you.
[time=2539] And when it's spirit empowered and not man empowered,
[time=2545] when it's spirit empowered and you're connected to him, see how all of this flows together, it does miraculous things in you but you have got to be here and you've got to be in your community and you've got to be in that time of study with your friends, you've got to receive it, now watch this.
[time=2565] You've even got to receive it and I would suggest the text implies that it's one thing to come and receive it on a regular basis when life is good, my friends it's another thing to receive it in hardship.
[time=2582] And let me just ask you this question to make this point, where do you go when it gets really, really tough?
[time=2589] When it gets really, really scary, when it gets really, really dark, when the wind starts to howl and the rain starts to come down, when it's really difficult for you, maybe just inwardly at a very deep personal level, where do you literally, where do you go?
[time=2613] Many of us would say, again in all honesty, many of us in the room would say to the store,
[time=2624] many of us would say to the plastic, some of us would say to the bottle, some would say to the pills, some would say to the cigarette, some would say to the refrigerator,
[time=2643] sorry, you know what I mean?
[time=2647] We go places when hardship hits, and he says, whoa, whoa, whoa, James, chapter one he says to Hoopamino to remain, he says to remain under, to endure, to stay put, and here he says in hardship you and I said, hardship should lead you and I to receive the word.
[time=2666] Hardship should lead you and I to the pages of scripture, difficulty, trial, and temptation should lead us to settings where we can receive what's true and right and can guide us through this.
[time=2678] I don't need a donut.
[time=2681] I need the truth, and I need it all the time.
[time=2688] Receiving the word in hardship.
[time=2691] Number four, write this down.
[time=2695] A fully surrendered church becomes a model, becomes a model to others.
[time=2702] A fully surrendered community of Christ followers becomes a model to others.
[time=2708] Says in verse seven, so you became imitators in verse six,
[time=2714] you received the word in much tribulation with joy, with the joy of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2720] Hey, don't miss that right there, I'm sorry, I'm kind of jumping around here.
[time=2726] I don't want you to miss that right there.
[time=2728] Before we go on to becoming imitators, I'm sorry, before we go on to becoming a model, I want you to see the last line in verse six.
[time=2736] If you and I are going to receive the word in much tribulation, if we take into account all that we've seen so far in this passage, look how it plays out, you and I are able to receive the word in much tribulation with the joy of the who, holy spirit, when you are deeply connected to him, when you are reading him and singing him and memorizing him and meditating on him and doing that alone and doing that with others and listening to and watching and filling your heart in mind with that, which is true and right and good.
[time=2773] When the alarm does what it should do and you're faithful to respond and when it's not just that hour, but the day to day of your life in mind, the Holy Spirit allows you and I to in the midst of great hardship, receive the word with joy and the hope that comes from that.
[time=2792] The fully surrendered church becomes verse seven, a model to others.
[time=2799] This is not a pride thing, my friends.
[time=2802] This is not a whoa, look at us.
[time=2804] This is not a, we've arrived.
[time=2806] This is a very humble, very delicate thing here, but I want you to see what he says, verse seven, so that you became an example.
[time=2815] Great phrase there in the original language.
[time=2819] It meant to leave a mark.
[time=2822] You and I, as genuine Christ followers and you and I as part of a broader community of Christ followers, here we are.
[time=2832] God says that when we do this right, we leave our mark.
[time=2836] It's a good mark.
[time=2838] It's like a brand.
[time=2839] It's like a brand on the back end of a cow, a cow walks around from then on.
[time=2844] Everybody goes, well, look who's been there.
[time=2846] It's a mark, it's undeniable.
[time=2850] Can't miss it.
[time=2853] And I get so encouraged.
[time=2855] You know many of you, a lot of you don't know this, but you're, and this is the truth, your neighbors talk to me about you.
[time=2866] You know that?
[time=2869] I go places just how this works.
[time=2870] It's part of the joy of getting to be who are getting to do what I do and maybe being the recognizable face, but see I'm at the grocery store or I'm at the gas station and they say, "Hey, aren't you?" And I go, "Yeah," and we talk and it's really cool.
[time=2885] And they say, "Well, my neighbor goes to your church." I say, and this is where it gets fun.
[time=2888] I say, "Well, who's your neighbor?" And they tell me who you are.
[time=2892] And then I ask them like 20 questions about you all the time.
[time=2896] No, I don't, but you know what?
[time=2897] They oftentimes, you're there going,
[time=2903] oftentimes they speak very, very highly of you.
[time=2908] Oftentimes they speak of your, your kindness and your gracious spirit
[time=2918] and your love for this place.
[time=2921] And sometimes they say it with that quizzical look like, I don't get it, but they do that and sometimes they're very, very dialed in.
[time=2931] Your employers, your employers, your boss talks to me about you.
[time=2939] 'Cause I meet them too.
[time=2941] I'll meet them at fundraising events or I'll meet them at dinners or I'll meet them downtown or I'll meet them out in the marsh, I'll meet them anywhere, same thing.
[time=2947] Hey, aren't you?
[time=2948] Yeah, I am and we'll talk and they'll say, "Well, you know what?
[time=2950] "One of your folks works for me." And I say, "Really?
[time=2954] "Tell me about it." And again and again and again, they talk about the mark that you leave on those that you work with.
[time=2962] Now, many of you are sitting here going, "Wow, "I hope you didn't meet my neighbor "and I hope you didn't talk to my boss." Maybe 'cause you're feeling like right now you're not making a mark.
[time=2977] I'll say it this way.
[time=2980] Maybe you're making a mark, but it's not the kind of mark you'd like to leave.
[time=2988] No, you can work at that.
[time=2991] We're being authentic, right?
[time=2992] We're gonna confess, we're gonna grow.
[time=2996] But we leave a mark.
[time=2996] I'm so grateful for the high school kids.
[time=2998] We had students from our own ministry this summer, make a mark in Yvonneville, in Russia.
[time=3004] Remember our team, they went over there and lives will never be the same because a band of high school students with some great leaders from Fort Wayne, Indiana came and gave themselves.
[time=3013] We make a mark.
[time=3016] That's what God has called us to do and that's what a fully surrendered community of Christ followers does.
[time=3021] Number five, write this down.
[time=3026] A fully surrendered church shares the gospel loudly.
[time=3031] I like how we said this.
[time=3033] It's because it's the way the text says it.
[time=3035] A fully surrendered church.
[time=3037] A church that makes much of him.
[time=3039] A church that really, really responds to the call that God has placed on us.
[time=3045] We are a people who share the gospel loudly.
[time=3050] Now this doesn't mean we do it obnoxiously.
[time=3054] It doesn't mean we do it without tact.
[time=3056] It doesn't mean that we do it in an offensive manner.
[time=3060] The loudly comes from the Greek.
[time=3062] Look at the text.
[time=3063] It says here, so that you became an example.
[time=3066] All believers in Macedonia and in a K of four, verse eight, for the word of the Lord has sounded forth.
[time=3073] You see that phrase there?
[time=3074] In the Greek that we've talked about this before, that was the idea of a trumpet.
[time=3080] It was a trumpet was blowing and it gives the picture of it being clearly and openly and with a sense of strength, it's being communicated.
[time=3093] And believe me, you can be clear and you can have that sense of strength and genuineness and not be offensive and not be rude.
[time=3105] And especially if you're trumpeting it, especially when you're doing the preacher thing, when you're just communicating it, especially when that happens in the context of a friendship that you have been willing to build and develop and cultivate or trust has been established.
[time=3122] And you first Peter 315, you get to communicate.
[time=3125] The hope is in you.
[time=3127] I get really, really bummed out.
[time=3133] Oh, I get really discouraged when you don't speak up.
[time=3136] When you and I keep our mouths shut,
[time=3142] when we have the opportunities to make the invitation, when we have the opportunities to have the conversation, when we don't trumpet it lovingly, but hold it in, how will they be saved if they never hear
[time=3161] and how will they hear if no one speaks?
[time=3164] And make sure that what you trumpet,
[time=3171] I wanted to say this and we'll move on, make sure that what you trumpet, make sure that what is what is sounded forth, make sure it's right.
[time=3182] Make sure you know and you think, oh gosh,
[time=3188] now see that scares me, Kelly.
[time=3190] What do you mean by that?
[time=3191] I didn't go to seminary.
[time=3192] You don't have to go to seminary to get this one right.
[time=3196] Watch, just remember this.
[time=3199] We are sinful.
[time=3201] You begin to argue?
[time=3205] You see a hand who wants to argue?
[time=3209] Do you wanna dialogue about the sinfulness in our natural inclination?
[time=3213] Oh, see, we are sinful.
[time=3216] Our sinfulness separates us from God because he is holy, righteous and perfect.
[time=3223] There's a dilemma.
[time=3224] We're sinful.
[time=3226] God is holy.
[time=3227] And he gives his son, Jesus Christ, the perfect spotless, what?
[time=3234] Lamb, the sacrifice.
[time=3236] We're sinful, he's not.
[time=3238] He gives his son, the person of Jesus Christ, to come and die, to forgive us of our sins.
[time=3244] Goes into the tomb, comes back three days, defeats death, so our sins could be forgiven and we could live forever.
[time=3252] And all of that comes in a fully surrendered art and life.
[time=3257] When you fully commit yourself to him, except the gift of life, they have a relationship, changes you, and that's what you and I are inviting them toward.
[time=3269] Now, I don't know all of you in this room, but I know most of you, and I know most of you well enough to know, you can say in your own way from your own spirit, in your own context, you can say, you can communicate that.
[time=3284] Keep it straight, sound it forth.
[time=3289] The fully surrendered church shares the gospel loudly, loudly, turns from idols.
[time=3296] Number six, we'll finish up here quick.
[time=3298] Turns from idols, look as the text goes on, it just paints a great picture of change.
[time=3303] The fully surrendered church has experienced this, for they themselves report about us, what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned, how you turned.
[time=3313] At the point of salvation, at the point of redemption, when he redeems you and I, he makes us new, and we move fully surrendered followers of Christ are in the process of, and it's a continual process, and we get better and better at it as life and relationship with him continues, we turn, we move away from, we don't go there anymore, we go in a different direction, and we're always doing that, but we're turning.
[time=3339] The pattern isn't there, the pattern is here.
[time=3342] You turn from, what does it say here?
[time=3345] We have a turned to God from idols.
[time=3348] Turn to God from idols.
[time=3351] I get so encouraged when I hear about you, I get so encouraged when I get to talk with you, and I get to read your letters, when I hear reports from staff people, many of you in this room, have been turning from idols.
[time=3368] Most of you aren't turning from the little statues on your fireplace mantle, most of you aren't doing incense and bowing and worshiping some little stone, but a lot of you have been, have been turning from your worship of success, money, drugs,
[time=3393] addictions, many of you have been experiencing the life changing, freeing experience of turning to God
[time=3404] away from that which is empty and futile and broken.
[time=3409] Many of you in the room are learning what it really is like to have your needs met, not in a man or a woman, but in a God who loves you deeply.
[time=3422] I see it all the time, turning from idols.
[time=3426] And notice that the fully surrendered church, they didn't just turn to God from idols and leave it at that, they turned to God from idols so that they could, what, what's the text say?
[time=3437] To serve, to serve people, having been given so much,
[time=3443] having been equipped, having been invested in, it says they turn from idols to serve, to help with those kids on Sunday morning, to help in the technical arena with PowerPoint or lights, to come alongside a student and be a mentor on our student ministry volunteer staff, to help as a greeter, to help with the grounds, to serve, to serve food downtown, to help build a shelter inside and outside these four walls.
[time=3473] They turn from idols to serve.
[time=3478] And we see that more and more around here.
[time=3480] I'm so thankful for the series that will begin in a few weeks, September 18th, we start six weeks, a life beyond me.
[time=3488] A biblical look at the heart and life of a servant.
[time=3491] I hope that you're gonna be here, I can't wait for it.
[time=3495] Number seven was they serve God.
[time=3497] And number eight, and I'll have you stand if you would, we're gonna just sing real quick here, just one verse of this song.
[time=3505] Number eight is they wait.
[time=3508] Number 10, a fully surrendered church waits.
[time=3511] And to wait, see what it says, and to wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead.
[time=3515] That is Jesus who rescues us from the wrath to come.
[time=3518] The fully surrendered church doesn't buy in to the cheap fix.
[time=3523] We don't jump at the first thing that comes our way.
[time=3525] No, we have decided to wait for that, which really satisfies.
[time=3529] (upbeat music)
