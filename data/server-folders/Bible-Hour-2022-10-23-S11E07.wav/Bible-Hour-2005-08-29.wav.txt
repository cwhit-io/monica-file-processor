[time=60] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=69] and on earth."
[time=76] Forgo and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=90] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=102] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=132] How great is our God, see with me how great is our God, and lo we'll see how great, how great is our God.
[time=184] The splendor of the King, of the majesty, and of the earthly choice, of the earthly choice.
[time=202] He wraps himself alive, a darkness tries to hide, a tremble's at his voice, tremble's at his voice.
[time=220] How great is our God, see with me how great is our God, and lo we'll see how great, how great is our God.
[time=246] Age to which he stands, and time is in his hands, again and again, again and again.
[time=264] The God had three in one, the Father's spirit sons, the lion and the lamb, the lion and the lamb.
[time=282] How great is our God, see with me how great is our God, and lo we'll see how great, how great is our God.
[time=308] And lo we'll see how great is our God, and lo we'll see how great is our God.
[time=358] Is our God, see with me how great is our God, and lo we'll see how great is our God.
[time=408] Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee.
[time=420] How great thou art, how great thou art.
[time=432] Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee.
[time=446] How great thou art, how great thou art.
[time=464] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, and it is a real joy to be able to welcome you again to the Bible Hour.
[time=468] We're so thankful that you've tuned in, and I'm so looking forward to what you're going to be able to experience today
[time=474] in the broadcast. You're really going to enjoy what you hear and see.
[time=480] This was a very special day in the life of our church. I mean, you talk about a legacy.
[time=484] You talk about the opportunity to kind of sit back and see what God has done through your efforts.
[time=492] This was a day where so many at Black Hawk were able to do that.
[time=496] You'll meet today a young man by the name of Josh Rang.
[time=502] Josh Rang is the gentleman who will be speaking today, and he delivers a powerful and very appropriate message
[time=510] to our family, and I hope you'll be encouraged. Josh grew up at Black Hawk.
[time=516] Josh was born and raised right here in Fort Wayne, came to our school, went all the way through elementary, junior high,
[time=522] high school, and the family of Black Hawk over the years has had the opportunity of investing in him
[time=530] and to see where God has taken him, to see the man that he has become, to know he and Paula, his wife, and their little girl, and Paula's even expecting a second child,
[time=542] and just to see God's hand on their life, and to see how God is using Josh.
[time=546] It's just an amazing thing. So many folks were so grateful to get to see him again,
[time=552] and I know you'll enjoy what he has to say as he teaches you this morning from God's Word.
[time=556] I also want to just take a minute, and I want to remind you, especially those of you in the viewing audience,
[time=562] this is very important. I want you to hear this, and I want you to understand the heart behind the invitation.
[time=568] We are going to celebrate a very, very special day, a very important day in the life of our church,
[time=574] and because we view you, the viewing audience, as part of this family, we don't want you to miss it.
[time=580] On Sunday morning, September 11th, for the first time in a long, long time, we're setting aside a day,
[time=586] a Sunday morning, both services, to celebrate 30 years of the Bible hour.
[time=592] This broadcast, this broadcast that has been coming to you and those in this community for 30 years,
[time=600] we want to celebrate what God has done. We want to tell some of the stories that God has allowed us to see and take part in.
[time=608] We want to give you the chance. This is big. We want to give you the chance to come, and we're going to ask you to do that.
[time=614] We want you to come that Sunday, and we want you to join us in thanking the many people who have helped bring this broadcast to you for years and years and years.
[time=622] There are so many faithful folks, men and women, who have given so much of their time in life, to make sure that the Bible hour broadcast was something that God could use in the hearts and lives of thousands and thousands of people.
[time=636] And we're going to take a Sunday and give you the chance to come and grab a seat and join us in that room and thank these people for all that they have given and all that they have done.
[time=646] It's going to be a spectacular morning. The guys are putting together a retrospect, a video. Look back on the 30 years.
[time=654] It will be both poignant and I'm sure funny. They've got some outtakes. They're going to let you see.
[time=658] I'm not sure how many of them I want you to see, but they're going to have fun with it, and we want you to come and join us.
[time=664] You may be a part of another church, which you know how we feel about that. We love the fact that you're a part of another church.
[time=670] If there's any way you can go to one service at your church and come be a part of one of ours, just so that you can say thanks, we would love to have you.
[time=678] Those of you that don't have a home church, you know what? Now's the time.
[time=682] This Sunday that we're referring to, September 11th, 9, 1045. I think it's your opportunity to finally come.
[time=690] Set foot in this place. Let us meet you. Let us get to know you and come and thank the people who have worked so tirelessly to bring you this broadcast year after year.
[time=702] We're celebrating 30 years of the Bible Hour, and we couldn't think of a better way to celebrate it than to have you there with us.
[time=708] So I hope you'll come. September 11th, 9 and 1045. We can't wait to have you here, and if you come, please make sure you come up and say hello.
[time=718] I'd love to meet you. God bless you and have a great week.
[time=748] Thank you for joining me. The purpose you created me for. What can I give? This life that I live.
[time=766] You've taken it all to use as you choose. So here I am.
[time=782] Be glorified in me. Every word that I speak. Be glorified in me.
[time=800] Every unspoken deed that the world may see Jesus shine through my heart so they'll know how wonderful you are.
[time=830] I see that I don't need to go far away to live at night days for you. Use me where you have me, Lord.
[time=846] My life is your doom. Father, you give this life that I live. And though I am failing, you have chosen me.
[time=868] So here I am. Be glorified in me. Through the scene and unseen. Be glorified in me.
[time=890] And every way, everything that the world may see Jesus shine through my heart so they'll know how wonderful you are.
[time=920] I don't want a glimpse of the praise. It all belongs to you. Let all of me fade away to all that's seen as you.
[time=946] It's you. Be glorified in me. When I'm broken and weak, be glorified in me.
[time=968] Be the source that I seek. The world may see Jesus shine through my heart so they'll know.
[time=980] If they will know, be glorified in me. In the life that I need, be glorified in me.
[time=998] As I serve you my King that the world may see Jesus shine through my heart so they'll know how wonderful you are.
[time=1014] Be glorified in me. How wonderful you are.
[time=1044] It was several years ago that I met this guy who was going to come and speak to you this morning.
[time=1062] He is for some of you in the room you've never met Josh Rang. You don't know the name and you're not familiar with him at all.
[time=1070] For others of you in the room though, Josh, his name and the name of his family, Josh is the son of Ron and Sally.
[time=1078] The Rangs have been around here for a long, long time. Josh Rang was born and raised right here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1086] Born and raised right here at Blackhawk. I got to know him several years ago through Russell Moore.
[time=1092] He was born and raised right there. His wife Paula moved out to California when Deborah and I were still out there and we got to spend a little bit of time together out there.
[time=1106] Our friendship has been a sweet one and I have been so thankful for Josh and his beginnings were here.
[time=1112] I think the screen will show you a little glimpse of that. Josh's beginnings were where he is right there.
[time=1120] That's him and he's a little guy and then he grew up a little bit more after that and there he is leading worship.
[time=1126] He didn't know that he had a voice and I sat next to him first hour and this hour and he doesn't but he did lead worship.
[time=1134] He did lead worship with the two gals there. Was that the 80s right there? It has to be the 80s.
[time=1142] What was that? Late 80s? Yeah. Leading worship over at the high school and then I think there's a picture of him getting his 21 alive player of the week.
[time=1152] If you go down the hallway by the gym and look at all the school records in basketball, you will see the name Josh Rang often.
[time=1160] Josh was given a gift by God, an athletic gift and he used it well. There's his 91 class of 91 picture.
[time=1168] There graduated with 26 others and there he is graduating from Cedarville University. Go Jackets. Is that right? Jackets.
[time=1180] And he went on from Cedarville and went on to the Masters Seminary, which is where I graduated from.
[time=1188] Josh and I know a lot of the same people and it was at the Masters Seminary that God began to just kind of further his work in Josh preparing him
[time=1196] for several years of ministry after seminary down in Mobile, Mobile down in Mobile, Alabama.
[time=1204] And now Josh and Paula and their little girl Hollis and Paula is expecting in about three weeks.
[time=1212] Another little girl, the four of them for now home is up in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Did I say that right?
[time=1218] Kenosha and Josh is involved in marketplace ministry and God's doing great things. And I just couldn't wait for the right time and I felt like this was the right time.
[time=1230] Couldn't wait to have Josh come and share with you and you're going to be blessed and you're going to be encouraged and would you please give a really, really gracious and warm welcome to Josh Rang.
[time=1240] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1252] Wow. You know, I'm amazed that I'm standing here knowing that I used to sit where you sat or sitting for so many years.
[time=1258] It's a really fun thing to be a part of. And this truly is, as you saw on the screen, it truly is a homecoming for me.
[time=1266] I told the story earlier that Sarah Siglin, you know her, Sarah Crook, and I used to, after Sunday evening services, we would race down the center aisle, but we would race doing forward roles.
[time=1278] And so we did all sorts of fun stuff in this auditorium. And I just have lots of memories.
[time=1284] And as I look out and see so many different faces, I'm just so very thankful for my time here and for what God did.
[time=1292] I was thinking about how I wanted to kind of introduce this message. Really one thing continued to keep coming to my mind.
[time=1298] And that was the sovereign plan of God in my life and how he has shaped me, but specifically how he used this place to shape me.
[time=1308] And I'm just very thankful. So I just want to say a quick thanks to Black Hawk.
[time=1314] A quick thanks to those of you who had such a huge impact in my life. And ultimately thank you to God for allowing all that to happen.
[time=1320] So, and Kelly, thanks for allowing me to come. It's really fun. I'm enjoying it very much.
[time=1326] So if you have your Bibles, turn to the book of Joshua, very appropriate since my name's Josh.
[time=1332] We're going to look at Joshua chapter one. So if you have a Bible, turn to Joshua chapter one, and when you get it, say, "Got it."
[time=1338] Okay. Thank you. We'll give some of you a little bit more time. That's okay.
[time=1344] If you got it, say, "Got it." Thank you. All right, one more time. A little bit more participation, giving you plenty of time to find it.
[time=1354] Even if you had to go to your concordance, and that's totally fine, no big deal.
[time=1356] If you got it, say, "Got it." Excellent. Beautiful. Beautiful. Okay, we're going to read this, and here's the deal.
[time=1364] If you would like to stand, you can stand. If you would like to sit, please stay sitting.
[time=1370] However you want to honor God in your heart as a reader's word, that's fine with me. But here's the catch.
[time=1374] If you're one person who stands, don't look at the person next to you who's sitting and think, "What a schmuck. Why aren't they standing?"
[time=1380] And if you're somebody who's sitting down and you're looking at somebody who's standing up, don't think that they're just some righteous person who thinks that they're, you know, they got everything together. Okay? Fair?
[time=1390] All right, let's read this. Joshua chapter one, then you do as you feel appropriate in your heart to honor God's word.
[time=1396] It says this, "Now it came about after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of none, Moses servant, saying, "Moses, my servant is dead.
[time=1406] Now therefore arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel.
[time=1412] Every place on which the soul of your foot treads, I have given it to you just as I spoke to Moses.
[time=1418] From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, and all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the great sea toward the setting of the sun, will be your territory.
[time=1426] No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you. I will not fail you or forsake you.
[time=1436] Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
[time=1442] Only be strong and very courageous, be careful to do according to all the law which Moses my servant wanted or commanded you.
[time=1448] Do not turn from it to the right or to the left so that you may have success wherever you go.
[time=1454] This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.
[time=1462] For then you will make your way prosperous and will make your way successful, you will have success.
[time=1466] Have I not commanded you be strong and courageous? Do not tremble or be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.
[time=1472] Verse 10, "Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying, 'Pass through the midst of the camp.'
[time=1478] And command the people saying, 'Prepare provisions for yourselves for within three days you are to cross this Jordan to go and to possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess it.'
[time=1488] And to the Rubenites and to the Gadites and to the half tribe of Vanessa, Joshua said, 'Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you saying, 'The Lord your God gives you rest and will give you this land.
[time=1500] Your wives, your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan.
[time=1506] But you shall cross before your brothers in battle array all your valiant warriors and shall help them until the Lord gives your brothers rest as he gives you.
[time=1516] And they also possess the land which the Lord your God is giving to them.
[time=1518] Then you shall return to your own land and possess that which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'
[time=1524] And they answered and they said to Joshua, 'All that you have commanded us we will do and wherever you send us we will go.
[time=1532] Just as we obeyed Moses and all things so we will obey you only may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses.
[time=1538] Anyone who rebels against your command and does not obey your words and all that you command him shall be put to death only be strong and courageous.'
[time=1546] Let's pray.
[time=1548] Father thank you for your word.
[time=1550] Thank you for your graciousness to us and God I just ask to please feed each and every one of us from your word that we would go out of this place.
[time=1560] I encourage that we would go out challenged that we would go out just having a greater glimpse of your power and of your grace and of your strong desire to be involved in our lives.
[time=1572] Lord thank you in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1574] Thank you you may be seated and if you're sitting you can continue to sit.
[time=1578] As we walk through this passage we're basically going to look at three different points.
[time=1582] Three main points as we walk through this entire chapter chapter 1.
[time=1586] Number one is this God has great plans for his people.
[time=1590] Number two is this God gives leaders to his people to help accomplish the plan.
[time=1600] And then number three is this it's very gracious of God.
[time=1604] God gives his people opportunity to respond.
[time=1608] And just a quick FYI for you I'm going to spend the majority of my time on the second point.
[time=1614] So if you're a clock watcher and you're thinking man he better get rolling on this because I'm at the second point I still got one to go and we only have a few minutes don't worry it's a part of the plan.
[time=1622] So let's get into this very one.
[time=1624] Number one God has great plans for his people.
[time=1630] As we read and as you see and as you may know this passage opens up with a scene of epic proportions.
[time=1638] God is about ready to make good on a promise made several hundred years earlier which still has impact in the world today.
[time=1648] Here's where they are they're getting ready to occupy the promised land.
[time=1652] They're getting ready to cross the Jordan and go into this land which God had promised to Abram several hundred years earlier.
[time=1660] You can look at it in verse two it says it he says now therefore rise cross this Jordan you and all this people to the land which I'm giving them the sons of Israel.
[time=1668] In verse six he says it again for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
[time=1674] God's making good on a promise that he made several hundred years ago it's a huge deal for these people.
[time=1682] As we back up let me just trace the steps back to it.
[time=1686] The promise was made to a man named Abram you can first see it in Genesis chapter 12 but in essence what happened is this.
[time=1692] God chose one man and he said to this guy Abram he said listen I'm going to take you to a new place and I want you to leave everything behind for a new life that you've never seen before.
[time=1706] And I'm going to do three things for you.
[time=1708] One I'm going to make you a great nation.
[time=1712] Two I'm going to give you a land and three which I think is the greatest because this is where I come in.
[time=1718] I'm going to cause you to be a blessing to all the world to the rest of the nations.
[time=1724] Sounds pretty good doesn't it? A great deal.
[time=1728] I mean wouldn't you accept?
[time=1730] I mean there's some difficult things where you have to leave everything behind to come to a life and to a land which you've never seen before but look at the payoff.
[time=1738] I mean you get to be involved in the plan of God to impact the entire world.
[time=1744] Long story short he accepts.
[time=1746] I would too.
[time=1748] Now let me take you from Abram to Joshua chapter 1.
[time=1750] Abram had a son actually Abram got changed his name to Abraham.
[time=1756] If you remember Abraham had a son named Isaac Isaac had a son named Jacob.
[time=1760] Jacob had 12 sons the children of Israel.
[time=1762] One of those sons named Joseph got sold into slavery he ends up in Egypt.
[time=1766] Remember he becomes basically second in power.
[time=1772] There's a huge famine in the land and all of the children of Israel now come to Egypt because that's where the food is.
[time=1778] They're there for a long time but they're put under slavery.
[time=1784] Moses shows up on the scene he does the let my people go thing with a little help from God they cross the Red Sea and now they're sitting across from the promised land on the other side of the Jordan and here's what they do.
[time=1798] They send 12 spies into the land 10 of those spies come back and they say listen this place is beautiful.
[time=1806] It's wonderful but there's one problem.
[time=1808] There's giants in the land.
[time=1810] There's Kelly birds in the land.
[time=1812] They'll destroy us.
[time=1814] There's no way that we could battle against these people.
[time=1818] And so as a result you guys have heard of a thing called the wilderness wanderings right.
[time=1822] God says well if you're not going to have faith in me then you're going to wander around this wilderness for 40 years.
[time=1830] The generation that doesn't believe is going to die off and I'm going to take a new generation into this land.
[time=1836] Here's where you get Joshua chapter one.
[time=1838] It's a new generation of people the old generation has died off and they stand poised to cross the promised land.
[time=1844] Cross the Jordan into the promised land to embrace God's promises for their future to ultimately impact the world for Christ.
[time=1852] I mean what an exciting time this must have been right.
[time=1856] As I was thinking about this message you know I couldn't help but just think man what I wouldn't give to be there to be a part of that mission.
[time=1862] I think man what an exciting time to be a part of God's people and I found myself just thinking about you know what a sad life I have.
[time=1872] Maybe you can relate right.
[time=1874] As you start thinking about how exciting it must have been then and then to start thinking about man what I wouldn't give to be there with him to participate in God's plan to impact the world.
[time=1886] Maybe you think your humdrum life doesn't matter much.
[time=1890] You know you think how can clocking in for another 40 hours a week at a job I don't even like matter in the end.
[time=1896] Maybe you think I'm so far behind on my bills that you know I can't even think about my life having purpose and excitement like they had back then.
[time=1906] Or I'm so disappointed in my marriage that you know what I just want to give up I can't have an exciting life.
[time=1914] I'm so stuck in my lifestyle of sin that I can't imagine God wanting to use me.
[time=1918] I tell you something those are all just lies from Satan.
[time=1924] God still has great plans for his people which means that in the midst of whatever circumstance you may find yourself today God has great plans for you.
[time=1936] God is building his church he said it in Matthew 16 and we as God's people have the privilege of participating with God in the great commission.
[time=1946] You know what it says right go therefore make disciples of all nations teaching them to observe all the things that I've commanded you.
[time=1954] For those of you who call black off your home this is translated helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=1960] This is the mission of the church and you can participate with God as you embrace this endeavor and it's just as exciting as it was 3300 years ago.
[time=1972] God is still working and he continues to choose people like you and like me to participate with him to accomplish his great plans in this world.
[time=1982] Isn't that amazing?
[time=1984] It's the first truth I want you to grasp to understand God has great plans for his people.
[time=1990] It was true back in Joshua's day in Joshua 1 it's just as true today for you.
[time=1996] If you are a child of God your life has purpose.
[time=2000] It's true for the people of Israel it's true for black today.
[time=2002] There's a second point that I want you to go home with and again remember I'm going to spend the most of my time on this one.
[time=2008] It's this God gives leaders to his people to help accomplish the plan.
[time=2014] The very first verse of Joshua chapter 1 tells us that there is a leadership vacuum.
[time=2020] The people of Israel stood at a pivotal point of their history and their leader was dead.
[time=2028] It's amazing how it says it there it's kind of interesting it says now it came about after the death of Moses.
[time=2034] The servant of the Lord that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of none and what does he say?
[time=2040] Moses my servant is dead.
[time=2042] It's almost like yeah you just said that.
[time=2044] What's he trying to do?
[time=2046] He's setting us context which we'll get to in a minute but here's what's going on.
[time=2050] Arguably one of the greatest leaders of all time was no longer available.
[time=2054] Moses was dead.
[time=2054] I mean stack this guy up against any world leader of all time and you'd be hard pressed to find one who had a greater impact upon the course of history.
[time=2062] I mean can you imagine what the people were thinking?
[time=2066] Moses is dead.
[time=2066] We've come so far.
[time=2068] We've done so many things and now God's just going to leave us here.
[time=2072] We're so close to seeing this promise fulfilled.
[time=2074] What now?
[time=2076] What are we going to do?
[time=2076] The people had seen awesome amazing things through the leadership of Moses.
[time=2080] This was the man who went twelve rounds with the then known ruler of the world Pharaoh and won.
[time=2086] This was the guy who met with God on Mount Sinai and when he came down from the hill the people of Israel couldn't even look at him because he was glowing because of the presence of God.
[time=2098] This was the guy who caused the Red Sea to part the guy who caused water to come out of Iraq.
[time=2102] This is the guy who led the people to the promised land only to die before bringing them in.
[time=2108] I mean this is drama people.
[time=2112] This is where understanding context plays such an important role in understanding scripture.
[time=2118] If we opened up Joshua one right here and that's all we read and we didn't understand what came before it.
[time=2122] This wouldn't be such a big deal.
[time=2126] But there's a history here.
[time=2126] There's a context.
[time=2128] You know when you think about context let me just help you real quick.
[time=2132] Syncing a pot, a 16 foot pot on the 18th hole really isn't that big of a deal right?
[time=2138] If you're out playing golf wherever you like to go you get to the 18th hole.
[time=2140] You got a 16 footer no big deal you sink the pot right?
[time=2144] But think about this.
[time=2146] When you're one of the best players on the PGA tour never to win a major tournament.
[time=2150] And when you're sick and tired of reporters asking you why you haven't won your major tournament yet.
[time=2156] And when people begin questioning your mental toughness and when you're in the last pairing on Sunday at the Masters at Augusta National tied for the lead and when you stand over a 16 foot pot on the 18th green
[time=2168] to win your first major title.
[time=2170] Now all of a sudden that putt is a little bit more difficult isn't it?
[time=2174] That's context.
[time=2176] That's exactly what God is doing here by letting us know that Moses is dead.
[time=2182] He's given us context.
[time=2184] So you know what?
[time=2184] These people had a history and now they're leaders dead.
[time=2186] In the midst of the people wondering what now God graciously steps in
[time=2192] and provides his people with a new point man.
[time=2194] He doesn't leave his people just waiting on a committee to decide when and how and even if to go forward.
[time=2200] He provides a new spokesman, a new leader to direct his people around his great plan.
[time=2206] He calls him in verse 2.
[time=2208] You can look at it.
[time=2210] But he says he speaks to Joshua and he says arise go over this Jordan you and all this people to the land which I'm giving you.
[time=2216] This was a huge assignment for Joshua.
[time=2220] But God was not going to leave his people without a leader because God provides leadership for his people to accomplish his plans.
[time=2228] When you look at there his call God's call upon Joshua was specific.
[time=2232] It was verbal and it was certain God had been preparing Joshua throughout his life.
[time=2238] And now he was God's man for this time for this task and for this people.
[time=2244] If the children of Israel were going to have a problem with Joshua they were ultimately going to have a problem with God because Joshua was God's man.
[time=2254] This appointment was a gracious gift demonstrating the awesome love and care of Almighty God.
[time=2260] You know the same is true today God still cares for his people and God still calls specific people to lead specific churches I believe.
[time=2270] And understanding that I can confidently say that some 20 or 30 years ago God was doing something very specific very strategic in the heart of a young man named Kelly Bird.
[time=2284] Because God knew that one day Blackhawk would have a leadership vacuum.
[time=2288] He knew that this church would be at a pivotal point in her short history.
[time=2294] He knew that this church would be growing and changing and adapting and striving to embrace the Great Commission in new ways.
[time=2302] He knew that the church would be poised for greatness.
[time=2304] And he also knew that the people would be wondering what now?
[time=2310] What direction do we have? What's our vision? What's our mission?
[time=2314] Who's going to lead us into this direction? And in God's sovereign plan he said to Kelly Bird arise.
[time=2324] Lead this people, my church, to embrace my great plans I have for them.
[time=2330] This is context again right?
[time=2332] This is real drama because according to God's perfect timing he graciously and specifically called Kelly Bird to be your leader for this time.
[time=2342] For this task and for you people.
[time=2348] I say graciously because I don't know if you've ever looked at it this way.
[time=2352] But God gives pastors as gifts to congregations.
[time=2358] In Ephesians chapter 4-11 it says and he talking about God gave some as prophets and some as apostles and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers.
[time=2368] The little word is gave. Literally pastors are a gift to the church from the hand of God.
[time=2376] Have you ever looked at your pastor that way?
[time=2378] Have you ever looked at your leadership team and said what an awesome gift these people are to us?
[time=2384] That's what the Bible says.
[time=2386] Oh be thankful people for your leadership.
[time=2392] You know I have you hugged your pastor today.
[time=2394] In fact I'm going to take advantage of this right now because I love again getting just engulfed in this guy's embrace.
[time=2402] I love you.
[time=2410] Your leadership team is a gift from God.
[time=2412] Hug them.
[time=2412] Encourage them.
[time=2414] Support them.
[time=2416] Write them.
[time=2416] Do whatever you can to be on board with them.
[time=2420] They are a gift from the hand of God for you.
[time=2424] Back to Joshua real quick.
[time=2426] Can you imagine what he was be thinking right now?
[time=2430] Okay Moses who did all these amazing things led the people here.
[time=2434] Now God you want me to take them across this Jordan to occupy the Promised Land?
[time=2438] Can you imagine just I mean a little bit overwhelming I think right?
[time=2444] But these next few verses are so key these next few verses would give me great confidence.
[time=2450] Because God not only calls Joshua but he also equips him and instructs him.
[time=2456] God gives him three main provisions in the midst of this assignment.
[time=2460] He gives him his promise, his presence and his word.
[time=2466] His promise first Joshua can have great expectations going into this adventure.
[time=2470] Listen to these words in verses three, five and six.
[time=2474] Verse three.
[time=2474] Every place that the soul of your foot will tread upon I have given you.
[time=2478] It's past tense literally God is saying listen it's a done deal.
[time=2482] You just need to go forward with faith and you'll have victory.
[time=2486] Verse five.
[time=2486] No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life.
[time=2490] Verse six.
[time=2492] To this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
[time=2496] I mean do you hear the decisiveness in this speech?
[time=2500] I mean literally just confidence just oozes from these statements.
[time=2504] You know when I played basketball here at Blackhawk Steve Lumbrick was my coach and he gave some pretty good locker room speeches before we went out.
[time=2512] But this has to go down in history as one of the best locker room speeches I have ever heard.
[time=2518] I mean if God is telling me this of course I'm ready to go out put me in the game coach I'm ready to play.
[time=2524] Because God is just going forth with his promise to say listen no matter where your footsteps I'm going to give you victory.
[time=2532] Kelly the same is true for you today.
[time=2536] Leading the church of any size can be overwhelming let alone a large church like Blackhawk.
[time=2542] But please know again God's word is packed with promises for you.
[time=2546] Your mission helping seekers find and follow Christ rests on some very tangible words God said in Matthew 16 I will build my church.
[time=2556] He's doing it it's going to happen so go forward with great confidence Kelly.
[time=2560] Because no person no power as the songs has no scheme of hell can for you as you partner with God in building his church.
[time=2568] God plus one is always a majority.
[time=2572] Now it may play out a little bit differently than you expect and look a little bit differently but he's still going to build his church.
[time=2578] That's God's promises.
[time=2580] Secondly under the second point is this God is going to give him his presence as well.
[time=2586] Joshua can move forward knowing that God is with him every step of the way.
[time=2590] Verse five as I was with Moses so I will be with you.
[time=2594] I will not leave you or forsake you.
[time=2596] Verse nine he says the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.
[time=2602] Does that sound familiar?
[time=2604] New Testament stuff going on there because the great commission you know how it ends and low I am with you always even to the end of the age.
[time=2614] Kelly again God's presence as you move forward is right there with you taking encouragement from that.
[time=2620] Pursue him walk with him enjoy his presence.
[time=2624] Number three is his word.
[time=2626] So God's not just leaving him out in the deep end of the pool but he's giving him his promises, his presence and then finally his word.
[time=2634] I don't know if we can put this diagram up on the screen but verses five through nine form a Hebrew structure called a chiasm.
[time=2642] It's a little bit difficult to explain but it's easy to see but here's what's going to happen okay.
[time=2648] There are certain things oh did they got it you got it on there all on one screen.
[time=2654] These are amazing okay look at that the lines that are underlined in the first phrase it says I will be with you.
[time=2660] Now look down at the very bottom for you will for with you will be Yahweh your God those two themes are repeated.
[time=2668] Now it goes in one it's almost like a little arrow head and it keeps getting tighter and tighter toward the middle okay.
[time=2674] The second one is be tough and courageous.
[time=2676] It's repeated twice at the beginning there and then look down before it says be tough and courageous.
[time=2682] Now it's going to go in one more level be careful to do all the law underneath there again it says be careful to do all that is written in the law.
[time=2692] And then so you've got these phrases repeated and it gets a little bit tighter a little bit tighter just like it's getting to the point of an arrow head.
[time=2698] Then there's one phrase that's not repeated and in essence this structure is giving all or pointing all the attention to this one phrase.
[time=2706] Do not let the book of the law depart from your mouth but meditate on it day and night.
[time=2712] This structure the Hebrews would have known that the main point of these verses is that phrase right there.
[time=2720] Yes Joshua has God's promises yes Joshua has God's presence but he also has his word.
[time=2730] This is the key to Joshua's effective leadership God boils the section down to one thought let my words be your life.
[time=2738] If Joshua were going to participate with God in this awesome plan for his people then he must do this one thing.
[time=2746] The mind was to absorb it and the mouth was to speak it.
[time=2750] In other words the law of God was to dominate Joshua's life and thinking.
[time=2756] I think we can all relate to that type of idea right?
[time=2760] I first met my wife and at Cedarville University go jackets and I walked into my sophomore year as my first year there
[time=2768] and I walked into the James T. Jeremiah Chapel and I was with my good friend named Jim Spaulding.
[time=2772] And Jim looked at me and said hey Josh where do you want to sit?
[time=2776] And so I had had my eye on this young woman and I saw her sitting down there and I thought you know what I would love to sit by her.
[time=2784] And so Jim said okay let's go because I had no idea that he actually knew her.
[time=2790] So at that point I am freaking out because I was not ready to meet her.
[time=2796] I had no idea you know how I was dressed how I looked how my hair looked if I had any zits all those type of important things.
[time=2802] But that's where we met and ever since that time at Cedarville I had Paula on the brain.
[time=2808] I couldn't stop thinking about her when we were there and when my mouth opened it usually spoke about Paula.
[time=2814] In essence that's what this is talking about to think on the word of God constantly and when your mouth opens up to speak it.
[time=2824] That's what that main point is.
[time=2826] Kelly again elders and pastors as you lead this church embrace God's promises enjoy God's presence and let the word of God dominate your life.
[time=2840] Effective leadership is a result of thinking on God's word and speaking God's word.
[time=2846] So God filled the leadership vacuum and his people stood across the Jordan ready to enter the Promised Land.
[time=2852] He graciously gave his people a leader Joshua.
[time=2856] He also gave Joshua three great provisions for his leadership.
[time=2860] Black Hawk as you stand poised to help seekers find and follow Christ God has brought you a leader Kelly Bird.
[time=2866] And the same provisions he made for Joshua are the same provisions he has available for your leader.
[time=2872] Isn't God good?
[time=2874] I mean as I was understanding this passage and I was thinking about the application for today the thing I got amazed about was just the consistency of God.
[time=2884] I mean the same things that are true in this scene in Joshua chapter one are the same things that are true today.
[time=2894] God is so consistent and God is so gracious and God is so strategic.
[time=2898] It's amazing.
[time=2900] There's a third point that I want you to see.
[time=2904] This gets really fun.
[time=2906] Because God has his plans God gives his leaders to help people accomplish the plan but God gives his people point number three an opportunity to respond.
[time=2916] That's where you guys come in.
[time=2918] God gives his people an opportunity to respond.
[time=2922] This is true not just for you but it's also true for the leader as well.
[time=2928] God's provision and God's calling didn't guarantee Joshua's obedience.
[time=2934] I mean think of all the obstructions that could have come his way.
[time=2938] He could have just let pride come in the door and think okay look at me I'm the leader of Israel at this point.
[time=2946] He could have let the doubts that were probably running around and around in his head. I'm no Moses.
[time=2952] Am I the right guy for this job? What do I think I'm doing here?
[time=2958] He could have let the people's opinions sway him right?
[time=2962] And he could have been more interested in pleasing people rather than God.
[time=2966] All those things could have led to his disobedience.
[time=2970] And yet as you look over the book Joshua comes through with flying colors.
[time=2976] Joshua's instructions in verse 11 to the people are almost verbatim to what God called him to do in verse two.
[time=2984] God said in verse two arise go over this Jordan.
[time=2988] Joshua told the people within three days you will cross over this Jordan to go and to possess the land.
[time=2994] Literally what God had told him to do he's doing it right here.
[time=2998] Said I'm going to obey God I'm going to follow you.
[time=3002] Later on in that section it confirms that point as well that Joshua was relying upon God's word.
[time=3010] He reminds the Rubenites, the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh of Moses' words in Numbers 32.
[time=3016] See God had given them the land east of the Jordan and that land had already been conquered by Israel.
[time=3022] But these people the two and a half tribes mentioned were supposed to go with Israel across the Jordan and fight with their brethren.
[time=3030] And so Joshua reminds them of this fact and he literally again calls them back to the commands of God.
[time=3040] And he says listen you need to obey.
[time=3042] Joshua accepted God's called embrace the mission took full advantage of the provisions of God and was well on his way to becoming the servant of the Lord as he's finally called at the very end of the book.
[time=3058] As you notice what he called at the very beginning he's just basically called Joshua the son of none Moses' servant.
[time=3064] At the very end of the book Joshua chapter 24 he's called Joshua the servant of the Lord.
[time=3070] He has a legacy of faithfulness and obedience to God's calling on his life.
[time=3074] Now this doesn't mean that Joshua was perfect.
[time=3078] In fact all you have to do is go to Joshua chapter 9 and see an episode where he failed to be dependent upon God.
[time=3086] But what it does show us it shows us that this man Joshua had a desire to follow God and to be God's man.
[time=3098] Again the consistency of God the same is true today.
[time=3102] God's call and God's provision do not guarantee a leader's obedience.
[time=3108] Kelly again the obstructions today are just as many as they were in Joshua's day.
[time=3112] Don't let pride have a foothold in your heart.
[time=3116] Don't give in to doubts you are God's man for this place and don't let the people's opinion turn you away from God's word.
[time=3124] Kelly when you speak and when you as a leadership team speak let it be God's word from God's heart packed with God's grace.
[time=3134] That's the leaders part now how about you guys.
[time=3138] Again God's plan and God's provision of a leader doesn't guarantee the people's obedience.
[time=3146] We only need to look one generation earlier to see this.
[time=3150] Do you remember what I mentioned earlier the wilderness wanderings?
[time=3154] They wandered around the wilderness for 40 years it's a long time.
[time=3158] Why?
[time=3160] Because they grumbled because they whined because they lacked faith because they were disobedient.
[time=3168] And as a result God would not let them enter the promised land.
[time=3172] In fact that entire generation had to die off before the new generation could enter.
[time=3178] Their problem wasn't their leader they had Moses.
[time=3182] Their problem wasn't that they didn't know the plan they knew the promise of God.
[time=3186] Their problem was disbelief and disobedience.
[time=3192] But this Joshua one generation wasn't going to let history repeat itself.
[time=3198] Listen to these words.
[time=3200] They come back to Joshua and they say all that you command us we will do.
[time=3204] Wherever you send us we will go just as we heeded Moses so we will heed you.
[time=3210] Whoever rebels against your command that does not heed your words shall be put to death.
[time=3214] As that for a response to leadership.
[time=3218] I would that do something for me.
[time=3220] I mean that's just amazing.
[time=3222] And can I share with you I just want to say thank you to you people because Kelly has shared with me that this is the attitude of this place.
[time=3232] And I'm so encouraged that you as a people of God would get behind your leaders and say
[time=3238] I'm ready to follow you.
[time=3240] You're God's man we're going to follow God's plan and let's go and let's do this for God's glory.
[time=3246] Thank you for doing that.
[time=3250] There's no doubt that these people here in this book were ready and eager to embrace Joshua as God's man.
[time=3256] If you read the rest of the book you'll see that God gave his people rest.
[time=3262] But you know let me just as I know that Kelly told me that that's what you do.
[time=3266] That that's the attitude of this church.
[time=3268] Let me just challenge you.
[time=3270] I know your leader isn't perfect.
[time=3272] But I know his heart.
[time=3274] And I am confident that he like Joshua has a great desire to do nothing but be God's man.
[time=3282] Knowing that let me ask you which generation are you more like today.
[time=3288] Would people characterize you like the earlier generation?
[time=3292] The grumblers, the winers, the ones full of unbelief?
[time=3296] Still happens today.
[time=3300] You don't grumble about the same things.
[time=3304] But here's what happens.
[time=3304] I hear this not just in this church but in lots of different churches.
[time=3306] You know people say things like this that service is way too long.
[time=3310] Or that service was way too short.
[time=3312] I wish they would go on and on.
[time=3314] Or I wish they would can that electric guitar or such and such a church still has a Sunday evening worship service.
[time=3320] Or I don't have time to build a relationship with my neighbor.
[time=3322] Or why are so many people concerned about lost people around here?
[time=3328] I mean the whining can happen today but let me tell you don't go for that.
[time=3332] God has way more for you than that.
[time=3338] Don't lose out on all that God has for you.
[time=3340] Be full of faith when your leadership makes every effort to speak God's word to embrace God's mission.
[time=3346] Get behind them and say all that you have asked us to do we will do.
[time=3352] That's how the latter generation responded and this is what God calls you to as well.
[time=3358] You know even though we're not fighting for land.
[time=3362] God still gives his people rest.
[time=3364] It's just a little bit of a different rest.
[time=3366] It's a spiritual rest.
[time=3368] It's not a rest in a land but it's a rest in a person.
[time=3370] A person of promise Christ.
[time=3374] And that spiritual rest comes from obedience and faith in him.
[time=3380] Man I want you guys to enjoy that rest.
[time=3382] To just know you know what I'm in the right place.
[time=3386] Blackhawk is seeking to embrace God's mission.
[time=3392] He's given us a leader that has a heart that wants to embrace that as well.
[time=3398] I'm ready to join in.
[time=3400] That's rest.
[time=3400] It's peace.
[time=3402] It comes from obedience and faith in God.
[time=3404] Do this for me though as a challenge.
[time=3406] When you go home today ask someone you trust.
[time=3408] Look at them in the eyes and just say you know be brutally honest with me but also be gracious at the same time.
[time=3414] Which generation am I more like?
[time=3418] Ask somebody that. How would you characterize me?
[time=3420] Because I don't want you to miss out on the rest which comes from faithful obedience to Christ.
[time=3426] To following this leadership that God has given you.
[time=3430] Alright.
[time=3430] I want you to know that God has great things for you.
[time=3434] I want you to know that God has done great things through you already.
[time=3438] I'm evidence of that just standing here in what God has done through this place.
[time=3442] But as you go forward God has great plans for you.
[time=3444] First of all God is building his church and he wants you to participate.
[time=3450] Ask God what he wants you to do to embrace and participate in the mission helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=3458] Secondly God has graciously given you a leader who has a huge heart to help you accomplish this plan.
[time=3464] Thank God for your leadership.
[time=3466] Thank God for Kelly.
[time=3468] Pray for him.
[time=3468] Encourage him to let God's word be his life.
[time=3472] And if you found yourself to be one of those winers maybe you just need to seek forgiveness from him as well.
[time=3478] Finally God's rest is available to you.
[time=3484] Get behind your leaders and follow them as they speak the words of God with the heart of God packed with the grace of God.
[time=3494] And be ready to watch God put his name on display for his glory and honor.
[time=3500] Let's pray.
[time=3502] God thank you so much for your consistency throughout time the fact that you never change.
[time=3506] Thank you God that you still have plans for us your people.
[time=3510] Or no matter what circumstance we find ourselves in today you have a plan for our lives that we can participate with you.
[time=3516] And you're so into us wanting wanting us to participate with you that you've given us leaders.
[time=3522] Thank you for the gift of leadership God.
[time=3526] What I pray that each and every one of us from Kelly on down that we would follow you.
[time=3532] That we would strive to have hearts full of obedience and that you would put your name on display in this place.
[time=3538] For your glory and for your honor Christ name we pray amen.
[time=3556] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=3616] You
