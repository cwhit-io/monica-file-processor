[time=60] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=69] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=81] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=86] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always,
[time=96] even to the end of the age.
[time=101] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=117] It happens every Sunday morning at 7 a.m.
[time=121] for the past 30 years.
[time=124] It's the Bible hour, it's the weekly television production of the worship services that we have here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=133] Do you ever wonder if it really makes a difference?
[time=137] Do you ever wonder if there's anybody out there who is or ever has been listening?
[time=143] Do you ever wonder if the camera and all this equipment makes any difference or if it's just in the way?
[time=153] Well, listen to these true stories as told by our actors, and then tell me what you think.
[time=171] I'm the kind of person who doesn't even think about it.
[time=174] I mean, if there is a God, fine.
[time=177] If there's not a God, that's fine too.
[time=180] I don't really care.
[time=181] I just live my life as I see fit.
[time=184] I do what I want, when I want, and I figure out what's right for me.
[time=189] After all, it is my life.
[time=192] Plus I'm turned off by religion.
[time=195] There's just too many hypocrites in legalistic ways of thinking.
[time=198] I just don't bother with any of it.
[time=200] That is until I started my new job.
[time=203] I'm an accountant for a real estate company.
[time=206] I'll spare you the boring details.
[time=208] It's really only interesting to people who love members.
[time=211] But what is interesting is my co-worker, Lisa.
[time=216] She's one of those people you can't help but like.
[time=219] She's always smiling, always talking to people, always acting like she's interested in everybody's business.
[time=225] And she's one of those people who's very open about her religion.
[time=230] When I first started working there, I thought, great.
[time=233] She's probably going to want to talk to me about it.
[time=236] I mean, she always manages to bring it up in conversation.
[time=240] This one day we took lunch together, and voila.
[time=244] Surprise, surprise.
[time=246] Came up in conversation.
[time=248] She just straight up asked me in a very casual way if I believed in God.
[time=253] I told her I had issues with religion.
[time=256] Maybe there was a God and maybe there wasn't.
[time=259] I just didn't really care that much to think about it.
[time=262] She didn't prod.
[time=264] But she told me that she had issues with religion too.
[time=268] And that religion and faith were two totally different things.
[time=272] Or faith is more of a relationship with Christ.
[time=276] I could tell she didn't want to make me feel uncomfortable or burdened.
[time=281] So she just ended the conversation there and said if I were ever interested.
[time=286] Her church service is broadcast every Sunday morning and I should check it out sometime.
[time=295] I am your typical guy.
[time=297] I have a great wife, two kids, full-time job stocking vending machines.
[time=302] I play poker out of my garage every Monday night.
[time=305] I get up every Saturday morning to mow my grass.
[time=308] And I have waited seven months for a football to start back up.
[time=312] Yes, I am your typical guy.
[time=315] I've never had anything real traumatic happen in my life.
[time=318] I mean knock on wood.
[time=320] But sometimes I get this feeling in my gut that something isn't right.
[time=324] I can't explain it any better than that.
[time=326] It just feels like this empty-like feeling.
[time=330] One of my poker buddies says, you know, that's the place where Jesus belongs.
[time=335] He's one of those religious guys.
[time=338] Don't get me wrong.
[time=339] Super nice.
[time=340] I love the guy.
[time=341] And we have a blast playing poker every Monday night.
[time=344] And all the guys enjoy hanging out with him because, you know, it's obvious he's religious.
[time=349] But he's not obnoxious about it.
[time=351] But I tell you what, that man has got something figured out.
[time=355] He always seems to be at peace.
[time=357] And like I said earlier, I sometimes feel like something's missing.
[time=362] I thought about going to church, but to be honest with you, I'm not a big fan of leaving my house on football Sundays.
[time=369] And I'm not too keen on the idea of being stuck in a room with a bunch of religious people.
[time=375] Get this.
[time=377] The other Monday night, he stayed after the guys have left to help me clean up.
[time=381] You know those religious guys?
[time=384] Well, he asked me if I could do him a favor.
[time=387] He asked me if I could get up early the following Sunday.
[time=391] Not to go anywhere, but to watch something on TV.
[time=395] I grew up in a Christian home.
[time=400] Always taught to obey God and to do the right things.
[time=403] I was your ideal child, really.
[time=408] But when I hit the college years and things started to go really wrong in my life, let's just say that my beliefs came into question.
[time=417] You see, my freshman year, my dad had an affair and my mom found out about it.
[time=424] Not only was I unbelievably angry with my father, but I was so disappointed with my mom.
[time=430] I mean, she should have left him, but she didn't.
[time=433] She wanted to stick to her vows of marriage.
[time=436] And my jerk father, yet he didn't even bother apologizing to me or my sister.
[time=441] He just pretended like nothing ever happened.
[time=444] In that same year, my boyfriend and I of three years had this really ugly breakup.
[time=450] And this new guy was dating, had a stroke, and died at 19.
[time=456] As if that's not enough drama to blow your mind, well, then came my sophomore year.
[time=463] It started out okay, and I was slowly healing from the trauma of the year before until I did something really stupid that messed up any progress I had made.
[time=473] I went back with my ex-boyfriend for one night, and I got pregnant.
[time=480] Well, I was an absolute turmoil for weeks about what to do, and I thought I was set on having the baby and giving it up for adoption, but that didn't fly with my ex-boyfriend.
[time=491] And before I knew it, my mom was driving me to the doctor's office to take some pill to make it all go away.
[time=499] Now, I am a type of person who has a need to understand things.
[time=504] And I'm going to tell you, I was a bit perplexed.
[time=507] I mean, why in the world would a loving God allow these things to happen to me?
[time=512] I just didn't understand. I wanted to know why.
[time=517] Is it so that I could be a comfort to someone else down the line who goes through the same things?
[time=522] Great. Thanks for choosing me. What a privilege.
[time=526] Well, these were the things I was going through.
[time=529] These were the questions I was asking.
[time=532] As far as my faith was concerned, well, I'd have to say that was almost non-existent.
[time=537] Until one day, my sister called.
[time=540] She told me she had been up early one Sunday morning, unable to sleep, and she was flipping through channels, and she came upon something on TV that she thought I should see.
[time=555] So I sat down, turned on my TV, and I watched.
[time=585] For over 30 years, the Bible hour has presented the unchanging message of Jesus Christ
[time=600] to a world desperately in need of hope, to share the truth that never changes.
[time=607] But the way that message has been presented has grown from the use of borrowed cameras from a local television station to the pre-recorded program produced in Black Hawk's own studios today.
[time=620] The Bible hour began late in 1974 as the Heritage Hour, named for the desire to preserve the biblical heritage of our faith, presenting music as well as teaching by Black Hawk's founding pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=636] The response to the program proved that it was meeting a need for those in the community and surrounding areas.
[time=643] The formation of the Founders Club and television rallies helped with the finances needed to keep the program on the air.
[time=650] The Heritage Hour would continue as a live program weekly, every Sunday morning at 7 a.m. for 12 years.
[time=658] Along the way, it became possible for the church to purchase their own cameras and set up a small studio
[time=664] where they could provide the live feed to the local television station for broadcast.
[time=669] Also, the decision was made to change the name to better describe the purpose of the program,
[time=675] which was, and remains to be, studying the Bible.
[time=679] And so the hour-long service from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church became known as the Bible Hour in 1978.
[time=688] With the purpose being to reach out to those not yet in relationship with Christ, as well as to offer the homebound of worship experience, there came an opportunity to reach out even further.
[time=700] The Bible Hour began to be broadcast across Indiana in cities such as Indianapolis, South Bend and Terre Haute,
[time=708] but also in other areas like Chicago, cities in Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as the Bay Area of California.
[time=718] Now, primarily focusing efforts here in the Fort Wayne region, the Bible Hour continues to be broadcast each week on Channel 21, even helping some prepare for worship at their own church.
[time=731] In 1981, Pastor Jeremiah left Fort Wayne, and yet the faithful presence of the Bible Hour remained on air.
[time=740] The solid truth of Scripture found its way into many living rooms every Sunday, as Pastor Rick Hawks became Black Hawk's senior pastor in 1983 and the primary teacher on the Bible Hour.
[time=754] During this time, the look of Black Hawk changed as the growing congregation outgrew their facility,
[time=760] and the worship center was built.
[time=763] With these larger, improved facilities, the Bible Hour was even more equipped to carry the unchanging message of God's love to our community.
[time=772] Also, during these years, the Bible Hour changed again.
[time=776] The previously live broadcast changed time slots, and by necessity, became a taped, delayed broadcast.
[time=784] This took away some of the unpredictability of a live broadcast and allowed more flexibility in what was presented.
[time=791] The Bible Hour continued to present a message and music each week, but the timing during the service didn't need to be regimented.
[time=800] It was in May, 1991, that Pastor Russell Moore began serving as senior pastor.
[time=806] The desire to continue the ministry of the Bible Hour remained as there continued to be a need.
[time=812] The purpose of the program has always remained the same, regardless of the changing world around us.
[time=818] To reach out to those who are lost, hurting, or homebound with the truth of God's love for them.
[time=825] The presence of cameras in the worship center is the main way the congregation senses this ministry.
[time=832] In October 1999, Pastor Kelly Bird stepped into the role of senior pastor,
[time=838] and the Bible Hour continued to evolve, offering an artful mix of worship and teaching times.
[time=845] Also, the program has recently begun telling more about other local churches and ministries that are available in this area, in addition to the music and message.
[time=855] Hope sometimes seems out of reach in this pain-filled world.
[time=860] But the faithful presence of the Bible Hour reaching out beyond the church walls, ministering to those who are homebound or who've never heard the gospel, even providing a supplement to other churches' teaching, the ministry is still committed to the purpose it began with.
[time=878] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=881] Well, hey, we want to take a few minutes here this morning as we come to celebrate
[time=897] and thank God for 30 years of the Bible Hour.
[time=901] We want to just take a minute and give you the opportunity to do what I know is on many of your hearts, and that is to say thank you, and I hope this morning that you'll say that powerfully.
[time=910] I hope you'll say it from the bottom of your hearts.
[time=912] There are a lot of people to thank.
[time=915] Probably no way we could do that endeavor justice, but we're going to sure try to do it in a way that would be meaningful and, I think, appropriate.
[time=923] First of all, I want to just do it this way. I want you to just realize that 30 years ago, September 1974 is when this began, and there have been literally hundreds of folks who have volunteered over the years to help bring the broadcast to this area.
[time=937] I want to show you up on the screen right now a current list.
[time=940] I believe this would be fair to say this is a current list of folks from directors to engineers, audio people, production assistants, camera, lighting, graphics.
[time=949] That is our current list, and there are some folks up there on that screen who have been doing it for a couple of years,
[time=957] and there are some folks up there who have been doing it for a very, very long time.
[time=962] And I want to go to the next slide to give you an idea of what that looks like.
[time=966] Chris Omen, Tom Baker, Bob Lee, Ross Bowman, 10, all the way down to 14 years,
[time=972] Tammy and Greg Nott, 14 years, Tim Bland, 17 years, Bruce Bone, 18 years.
[time=979] And you have Ed Richard, Paul Ponert, Paul Taylor, Dave Pells, Dale Seagland, 2027, 29, 31, and 31.
[time=990] That's 31 years.
[time=993] And they have been doing this because they believe in their hearts what God did.
[time=999] You know, when He birthed this vision, they believe in their hearts that their service and them using their gifts
[time=1005] and their willingness to come early on Sundays and stay late sometimes and help with equipment.
[time=1011] They believe in their hearts that it makes a difference.
[time=1014] And I believe everybody in this room probably knows that it does, that it has.
[time=1021] Raise your hand if you watched the Bible hour at some point in time before coming to Blackhawk.
[time=1026] There you go. Raise your hand if you know somebody who's come to Christ and that started or somehow the Bible hour was involved in that process.
[time=1035] Absolutely. It's so good for us to just be reminded of that.
[time=1039] So I'm going to ask, we've got a bunch of these guys sitting down here.
[time=1042] I see the knots and Eddies down there and Bob Lee and there's Mr. Baker, Mr. Bland and Dave Pells and Paul Ponert.
[time=1048] I'm going to ask you folks who are out here to stand just and then hold on the applause.
[time=1052] This team right here, stand up there. There we go.
[time=1055] You all stand. Thanks very much. There's Bruce.
[time=1058] I also want to say this. There's some folks back in the studio right now working and putting all this on so that they could hear you if you were loud enough.
[time=1066] And then I also want to do this. If you're in the audience today, I hope this is okay, Eddie.
[time=1070] If you're in the audience and you've ever helped with the Bible hour, you've ever done anything with the Bible hour.
[time=1075] Maybe you're not doing it currently, but in the years gone by you manned a camera or you helped in the back or you did something to help this ministry move its way along.
[time=1084] If you're here today and you've served in that capacity in any way, would you just stand quietly where you are?
[time=1090] Would you do that for us please? Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Good. Thank you very much.
[time=1096] All right. Would you all, from the bottom of your hearts, from the ones who have been at it for a few months to the ones who have been doing it for 30 years, would you all please, as a family, thank these people for their faithful service?
[time=1110] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1118] Oh, that's good.
[time=1119] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1127] Awesome.
[time=1128] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1130] Awesome. Thanks, guys.
[time=1132] Steve, would you come on up? I'm going to ask Steve Longbrake, and I'm going to ask Dale Seagland and Ed Richard if they'd come on up.
[time=1139] I know everybody who's ever been a part of the Bible hour would think it appropriate
[time=1145] and a good idea to do this and we're going to. I'm going to ask Ed.
[time=1149] Richard, who currently gives leadership to this ministry and gives so much of his time and energy to it to join us here.
[time=1157] Steve Longbrake, our wise old sage on staff and teaching pastor, and Dale Seagland joins us here. Hi, guys. Have a seat.
[time=1167] Dale, as you saw on the screen a little bit ago, has been at this for 31 years,
[time=1173] and Steve Longbrake has been here. I realized this week as I was thinking about this.
[time=1177] Steve's been here for most of these 30 years, and I just wanted Steve to speak briefly this morning.
[time=1184] As you look at the video, Steve, and you see all that God has done, and as you look at these two guys, as you see Dale, and you see Eddy sitting up here with us, I know you have great love and respect for them both, and I know you've seen a lot in this ministry over the years.
[time=1197] Just share with the folks some of the things that come to your mind.
[time=1200] I think I kind of got my blubbering out of the way first service, so you guys won't have to bear up under that.
[time=1205] I love these two men. I love and respect them.
[time=1209] And Kelly's right. I've been able to watch a lot of things happen here.
[time=1212] You know the Bible hour started in the church. It's the asylum.
[time=1216] You know, that was the church when the Bible hour started and the cameras were in there, and Dale was involved in that then, 1974. That's a long time ago.
[time=1225] And Dale and Mary Kay Siglin have been faithful servants in this church all of these decades.
[time=1233] Mary Kay ran our nursery for two decades.
[time=1238] It's a long time to work in the nursery and to find all those people in there.
[time=1243] And Dale was our business administrator at the church, and the director of the Bible hour, and has just done an incredible number of things to help us grow.
[time=1253] Built the building across the street, and really was a huge participant in this too. I shouldn't say he built it.
[time=1259] He was a great participant. He led the charge in the building constructions that we've had.
[time=1263] And I'm just so thankful for Dale and Mary Kay. They've been wonderful servants of God.
[time=1268] You know the Bible hour is really important in our family.
[time=1271] Stephanie was born on December 7, 1980, and Dave Jeremiah announced that Renee was in labor on the Bible hour.
[time=1279] So Steph soys enjoyed that, that she was on TV while she was being delivered.
[time=1284] You know, I caught a lot of flack for that because I was there teaching my Sunday school class that morning.
[time=1290] And women that saw me, they were really angry when they found that out.
[time=1294] Dr. Eastland had said it was fine. I could be there. I had plenty of time, so don't be angry about that women.
[time=1300] Ed Richard was drug here by Pete Coby to participate in a group called Sounds Alive that traveled around the country,
[time=1311] representing the Bible hour often in different settings, and Ed came and became the leader of that group,
[time=1318] and he was the technical, the sound man, okay, and sang as well, didn't you?
[time=1324] You didn't even sing then? Well, you developed your voice later then, yeah.
[time=1330] Ed was instrumental in what went on here technically, and in this building, Ed was very much a participant with Dale and these guys,
[time=1339] and the engineers, Jack Van Till and a whole bunch of other guys, that pulled all the cables for this building
[time=1347] and the Bible hour could function in here. You don't know what that means, we're talking about miles of cables.
[time=1352] They worked for weeks every night, incredible thing, and Ed and Marsha have sacrificed tremendously to serve God in our church,
[time=1361] and they have been faithful to do that, and Ed and Dale have been giving and taking from each other all of these years,
[time=1370] learning from each other, and teaching each other, and serving together so that the Bible hour has had a huge impact on building the kingdom.
[time=1379] I am really thankful. Absolutely. Hey, yeah, thank you.
[time=1384] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1388] Hey, Eddie, I know you've got it. There's a special friend down there in their front, would you introduce him?
[time=1392] A guy who I know has served with you for a number of years.
[time=1396] Welcome, Glenn.
[time=1402] Thank you for the Bible hour, and they were there almost from its inception, and he was listed up there under engineering,
[time=1410] which is what he did, and Debbie was an assistant producer, and they were here kind of from the beginning,
[time=1418] and I think he came out, I think we talked about this first service, he'd come out when the other engineer couldn't be there,
[time=1424] or he'd fill in for the guy, and the other guy came to Christ by being on the Bible hour staff when Channel 21 still did the production,
[time=1435] and then Glenn would fill in, so he got saved. He's still a Christian, or still going to church somewhere, I think, in town,
[time=1441] but Glenn and Debbie have since moved on, but we still kind of call him part of the Bible hour because once a year, I'll call him up,
[time=1449] and I don't know a better engineer in town, and when we have the kind of problems that none of us here can solve, I call Glenn,
[time=1456] and he comes up, and so about once a year, he'll spend a day with me, and make sure that everything stays tweaked and working well,
[time=1463] and I thank you for that, and Deb, for letting him come up.
[time=1466] Eddie, talk a little bit about Dale Seagland. I know you guys have been together for a long time, but share with the folks kind of what comes to mind when you think about the investment that Dale has made not only in this ministry,
[time=1476] but in your life as well, and there is a great picture of Dale, by the way, right there.
[time=1480] Oh my.
[time=1482] That looks like it hurt, Dale. Did that hurt? It looks painful.
[time=1486] Those old headsets did hurt. Man. It had director on the top.
[time=1490] Don't wonder you guys lost your hair.
[time=1493] This is scraping it right off, it looks like.
[time=1497] I had three things that came to mind, and I wrote them down so that I wouldn't forget.
[time=1502] The first one I learned from Dale was leadership, and I heard somewhere from somebody that a lot of what you learn is caught more than taught.
[time=1511] I know that's true in our families, with our children, and I didn't spend a lot of time with Dale saying,
[time=1517] "How did you do this, or what did you do there?" I just watched.
[time=1520] I watched, by his example, I watched what he did, and I watched in all the situations that we were in, and when it came time for me to take over, I had a pretty good idea of what was expected of me,
[time=1534] not because we sat down, but because he spent time doing what he does.
[time=1539] The other part of that was that when it came time for me to do that, I don't know how you guys are,
[time=1550] but a lot of times, and I know these guys will say, "This is true of me." When I'm trying to teach somebody something new, if I know how it should be, it's really hard for me to let go.
[time=1559] I want to get in there and say, "No, no, no, you got to do this." I always try to remember what Dale taught me, and that is, "Okay, it's their turn." When I would go up and do something, he wouldn't say, "Gee, that was really stupid." Or reach in to fix it, he'd just say, "You know, you could have done better if you'd have done this on that shot.
[time=1576] You could have improved, and I'd just marked that away." And he let me do my own thing.
[time=1580] And so what was difficult at first, taking over, became a lot easier.
[time=1585] And in a real short time, I was comfortable with Dale being there, and it taught me more.
[time=1590] The second thing was quality.
[time=1594] One of the things that I learned from this church, and from the people specifically in the Bible Hour,
[time=1600] is that what we do, our ministry is our gift, and how we exercise that gift is our offering to the Lord.
[time=1609] And a sloppy camera shot, or a bad take, is not our best work.
[time=1617] And I learned from Dale that every day, every time we go on the air, we need to do our best work.
[time=1624] And the last thing, and this is true of all of the guys that are involved here, as well as Dale, as you can see by the number of years that a lot of these guys have served.
[time=1633] I learned how to volunteer. I said, "First hour, I'm paid to be here." And so I don't punch a clock, but I'm salaried, and I'm supposed to be here, and I love doing it.
[time=1643] But I'm here because of that. These guys are here because they believe in the ministry.
[time=1647] And I don't have to call when they're on the schedule. I don't have to worry about if they're going to make it.
[time=1653] They're there. I don't have to follow them around and see if they've done their job right.
[time=1657] They're faithful. They love the Lord.
[time=1659] And they know that the job they're doing is going to produce results that they may not see.
[time=1665] And for that, I want to thank you guys for teaching me what a volunteer is.
[time=1671] Because I wouldn't have learned it without guys like you, and you other guys that stood up that are here.
[time=1678] I saw Gary over there. I saw Mark Archer.
[time=1681] Mark, Tim Barker back there. Thank you guys for coming, too.
[time=1685] Dale Siegelin.
[time=1687] As you watch the video this morning and as you think back on 31 years, I know your mind and heart must be filled with a lot.
[time=1695] Share with the folks some of the things that you reflect upon as you think back on this ministry and all that God's allowed you to be a part of.
[time=1704] When I came to the first hour, I had no idea I was coming up to say anything, so I was completely caught off guard, so I'm not much more on guard right now.
[time=1714] But I will say, you know what? I love singing how great thou art.
[time=1720] [AMEN] Singing has never been one of my gifts, and most of the words I couldn't get out.
[time=1733] I just couldn't sing. It was great. Thank you.
[time=1738] You know, there's a lot of stories. We're listening to Bill Hywell's on Friday night and telling stories and painting pictures, and I can't do that, but I do want to share just a couple of stories of things that create memories.
[time=1752] When the Bible R started, it was staffed with equipment and people from WPTA, and the only involved but from the church was just to be coordinators and kind of coordinate the way the music,
[time=1767] happened, and so we could inform the people that were doing the director, so they had a director, they had an engineer, and they had two camera people.
[time=1775] We had two very old, very big cameras. You saw one of the pictures up there.
[time=1782] Some interesting things happened in that. About a year into that, we were able to replace the cameramen with our own camera people.
[time=1793] Then there was a snowy morning when the director couldn't get here, and they said, "Dale, would you like to direct?"
[time=1805] I'd never switched those buttons and pulled that or called those camera shots and that sort of thing, but that was my first introduction, and then for a long time after that, I directed actually most of the programs.
[time=1818] There was the time when those two cameras, neither of them having very good reliability, one of them began smoking during the service.
[time=1829] There's this whiff of smoke going up. We also had an organ catch on fire, too, back in those days.
[time=1836] It was more than we would like to remember. We had one camera show, and we were live, so we began seeing how great our art at 10.59, and at 11 o'clock, we picked up the signal on WPTA.
[time=1853] We could watch it on the television as it was being produced, so there was a little bit more adrenaline and a little bit more excitement punching the buttons in the live environment.
[time=1865] How many remember the blizzard of 1978? Is that right?
[time=1873] It was pretty hard, came in on a Thursday and Friday, and people weren't moving very much by Sunday morning, but we had the microwave tower out here, so we could communicate with WPTA.
[time=1886] They were still on the air, and we had, by that time, our own equipment. We were in the Convocation Center,
[time=1893] and we decided to go ahead with the program rather than playing a backup program that was there.
[time=1900] And I think that there was a totality of less than 20, maybe 20 or 30 people in the total sanctuary at that juncture.
[time=1910] We sent snowmobiles out to pick up some special musicians, and I know that David Jeremiah made a special presentation encouraging people to be faithful in their stewardship to their local church, so that he was trying to help all the other local churches out, but that was a very memorable activity.
[time=1932] So those are just some stories you heard Steve talk about the worship center here and all the work that went into that.
[time=1941] The thing that I look back on most is the people.
[time=1947] When Blackhawk began to supply the camera people, it was Dave Pills, somebody by the name of Brent Overholt, who's now in the Phoenix area, and Dan Steeman.
[time=1958] There might have been another person, but primarily those three individuals did on a little bit of a rotational basis, and Dave took a little sabbatical in the middle, but has been working with us most of that time since then.
[time=1969] Paul Taylor came in early and has just been a super faithful person.
[time=1976] Paul Ponert, Glenn, and I mean, I will omit people, but just so many people that have had a really significant impact on my life by their faithfulness.
[time=1990] As Ed said, this is a group that you don't have to nag and persist and check and all that sort of thing.
[time=1996] If they're scheduled, they're going to be here and they're going to do their job well.
[time=2001] And I guess the last thing in closing is that in all of this, the Bible hour has been about the message.
[time=2011] It's been about quality. It's been about doing the very best job we could.
[time=2015] It's been recognizing that we're not competing on air with another church program.
[time=2024] We're competing with broadcast network television in terms of quality and expectations.
[time=2030] And so it's always pushed us to try to do as good as we possibly can.
[time=2035] But it is the message that goes out through the music and through the teaching of God's Word that's been consistent and faithful, and that's why God has chosen to bless this ministry.
[time=2047] So that's my thoughts.
[time=2049] Thank you so very much. Well, I just wanted you all to hear from these two guys, and I wanted you to be able to say thanks.
[time=2055] I do want to say this first. I know that behind every good man is an even better woman most of the time.
[time=2061] And I know I don't know if Mary Kay is in here again this hour. She's in the nursery. Is Marsha here? Marsha, could you just raise your hand?
[time=2068] Where are you? Raise your hand. She's back there on the back. There's Marsha, Richard. And thank you, Marsha.
[time=2073] And so for Marsha and for Mary Kay, for Dale, for Ed, their team, especially these two, and all that they have given, would you just please graciously thank these men for all that they have done.
[time=2085] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2090] There you go. Absolutely. Praise God.
[time=2095] [APPLAUSE - 5 seconds]
[time=2107] Love you very much.
[time=2109] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2114] All right.
[time=2117] Well, let me just, if I can remind you of a few things here before we go this morning.
[time=2122] And I'm going to do that just by reading a couple of things, a couple of notes to you that I've received over the years.
[time=2129] A few years ago, an abandoned wife and mother of four wrote me this note.
[time=2144] She says, "Thank you so very much.
[time=2148] As I sit here in the cold darkness of another January Sunday morning watching you on my television while my kids sleep,
[time=2157] I'm overwhelmed with the notion that someday I may actually set foot in a church once again.
[time=2164] The betrayal and hurt have hit so deep over the years, and though I swore to never allow the church to manipulate and abuse my trust ever again,
[time=2173] I must admit, I can sense as I listen to you teach God's word as I'm given the privilege of worshiping quietly here in my room, along with Corbin.
[time=2182] As I observe the heartfelt worship of those special people gathered there week after week,
[time=2188] I must admit that God is rekindling hope in a very weary heart."
[time=2195] And we hear that, and I read that again and again and again.
[time=2203] Please thank your team for their faithfulness, and please don't ever forget that there are thousands of me's in this world.
[time=2215] Thousands of me's that need to see and hear the truth lived out and spoken with honesty and integrity.
[time=2223] Praise be to God for the Bible hour, and thank you so very much for all of you that give so much to bring it into a wounded but slowly healing soul like mine.
[time=2235] Please keep speaking, leading and loving.
[time=2237] We're listening and learning more than you'll ever know, sincerely yours.
[time=2242] And she signs it learning to trust again in Garrett.
[time=2248] Another friend shared with us recently, he wrote saying, "I've been attending church for over 35 years.
[time=2256] And never in all my days did I know that the Bible had so much for me personally."
[time=2264] Do you ever hear anybody say that?
[time=2267] We hear it all the time.
[time=2271] Thirty-five years and never in all my days did I know that the Bible had so much for me personally and that it spoke to the everyday issues of my life.
[time=2280] As I watch each Sunday morning now, I actually feel cheated and a bit angry I must confess.
[time=2286] It's as if my church kept this amazing gift from me that could have both helped and prevented so much in my life.
[time=2294] Thank you for teaching me the Bible, thank you for passing along the gift, and thanks so much for a broadcast that's reaching me and so many others that need to hear and understand the Scriptures.
[time=2306] P.S., how do you get so many people there at 7 a.m. in the morning?
[time=2313] We had to write him a quick note back and help him understand that whole concept of tape.
[time=2321] But you know what my friends I share that with you especially that last note.
[time=2326] Because I believe in my heart that it's that last note there from that guy who felt cheated for 35 years because he never had anybody explain the Bible to him.
[time=2338] I believe it's that note that strikes at the heart of what thousands of people over the last 30 years have sensed and shared with many of us time and time again.
[time=2348] And what they've said time and time again in essence capsulated is this.
[time=2356] Though the, and the video just helps us with this this morning, though the styles have changed and they have, haven't they?
[time=2367] It's amazing looking back.
[time=2369] Though the styles have changed, though the look and the staging are different, though coats and ties have given way to new shirts from Marshals and golf vests and khaki pants.
[time=2384] Though the forms have come and gone forms right forms, ties, coats, robes, hymnals, choir lofts, forms, though forms have changed.
[time=2403] It's what they say again and again in their own words, our function, our function, what we do, what we are fundamentally committed to has never, ever been altered.
[time=2420] We have for 30 years, 35 and growing as a church, 30 years as a broadcast ministry, we have always tried to lift up, teach and explain the Bible.
[time=2434] Period.
[time=2436] That's it.
[time=2437] That's what so many people have said again and again over the last 30 years.
[time=2441] And I got to tell you, I am so grateful for, and I want you to hear this from me, I am so, and I would just echo what our good friend Dale Siegelen just said.
[time=2451] I thoroughly enjoyed singing that song this morning.
[time=2456] The way we sang it, with the voices that you sang it with, I absolutely loved it.
[time=2462] You know, I grew up singing that song.
[time=2465] When I hear that song, I think of being under a pew with my mom reaching down, kicking me, trying to get me to get back up as we would sit in that front row at my dad's church.
[time=2476] I love, I love the heritage that God has given us.
[time=2482] And you might think, well, yeah, but you also have certain styles today that you like and you have certain preferences and we're doing certain things and it looks, oh, you know what I do.
[time=2492] We do, it always changes, my friends.
[time=2496] It always looks different.
[time=2498] But I tell you what, I'm so grateful for the heritage God has given us.
[time=2502] It was just a couple weeks ago.
[time=2504] Do you remember when Josh Rang came and spoke, came and taught us on Sunday morning, Josh was a graduate of our school, it was just a couple of two Sundays ago.
[time=2512] That Saturday night before, Josh had gotten ahold of an old videotape.
[time=2516] He had gotten it from his grandmother, Sarah Langis, bless her heart. Sarah has been a part of this church for years and years and years and Sarah had given Josh this video.
[time=2524] Well, Josh and Paula came over to our place.
[time=2527] Kevin and I and the kids and Josh and Paula popped this video in.
[time=2530] It's the Bible Hour broadcast from May 19, 1991.
[time=2536] It was my good friend, Russell Moore's, very first Sunday here in this room.
[time=2545] Raise your hand if you were here May 19, 1991.
[time=2549] Yeah, still a bunch of us, a bunch of you, I wasn't.
[time=2552] But I just, I got to tell you, I was so encouraged and I was so amazed again at how God just takes different times and different seasons.
[time=2561] And He just does it a certain way and it looks a certain way and it sounds a certain way, but it's special.
[time=2567] We looked at the screen and it was just amazing to see there were there were 200, there were 200 voices up in the choir loft that was up there, robed and just looking great and sounding spectacular.
[time=2582] It was just amazing.
[time=2584] Oh gosh, the organ was over here at that time and there was our friend Scott Schindler.
[time=2590] He was over here just banging away, I mean my TV was shaking, this room had to be shaking.
[time=2597] It was just a powerful, powerful scene.
[time=2600] The pastors used to sit up here on the stage still, you might remember that.
[time=2605] And in the middle was the brass section, the horn section, it was so funny.
[time=2609] Gary Kans and Jeff Flowers and Wade Holbrook were the three guys they showed on the screen.
[time=2614] That's the same three guys that are still blowing their horns over here every week.
[time=2618] It was amazing, they just had more hair and it was darker, but it was the same three guys.
[time=2624] Rich Leedeky, bless his heart, Rich had the bell choir in full array.
[time=2628] I mean they stretched from here all the way down to here, all of them were gals.
[time=2633] And remember the bell choir, some of you don't remember the bell choir, but the bell choir was an amazing thing.
[time=2638] And a special ensemble group called Reflection Sang and it was just incredible.
[time=2645] At one point at the conclusion of a big choir number, Pete Kobe turned around and the whole church stood up
[time=2651] and they just bellowed out the church as one foundation.
[time=2657] And I just sat there so thankful for all that he has given us, the heritage and the lineage
[time=2664] and the privilege that we have today to continue to be who God's called us to be.
[time=2669] In a day and a time that's a little different than 1991, but on we go faithfully trying to be God's people,
[time=2677] carrying God's message of hope and healing and faith.
[time=2683] And so it's amazing to see and when I hear people respond, when I get the letters and when I get the emails,
[time=2693] I hear again and again and again and again, thank you for the word of God.
[time=2699] Thank you for the word of God. It reminds me of what it says in Nehemiah.
[time=2703] Can I just read this to you?
[time=2705] In fact, why don't you just stand in honor of God's word.
[time=2709] We'll sit again and then we'll go in just a bit here, but let me just read this to you.
[time=2713] Nehemiah.
[time=2722] Nehemiah chapter 8, it says in all, well, let me read the last verse of chapter 7 because it gives great context.
[time=2730] Whenever I think about people responding to the word of God, my mind and heart often come back to Nehemiah.
[time=2737] Listen to how this unfolds.
[time=2739] And when the seventh month came, the sons of Israel were in their cities.
[time=2743] That's how chapter 7 ends.
[time=2745] It's important that you understand that they were in their cities.
[time=2748] My friends, they hadn't been in their cities.
[time=2751] They had been in captivity.
[time=2754] This is the end of the Babylonian exile.
[time=2756] And now the people of God have been allowed to come home.
[time=2758] And it's been a long, long time, but they're finally home.
[time=2762] And all the people gathered as one man at the square, which was in front of the water gate.
[time=2767] And they asked Ezra, first thing they do is they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses,
[time=2773] which the Lord had given to Israel.
[time=2775] Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women, and all who could listen with understanding on the first day of the seventh month.
[time=2783] He read from it before the square, which was in front of the water gate from early morning until midday.
[time=2789] It would have been about six hours that he stood there and read publicly the Scriptures.
[time=2798] In the presence of men and women, those who could understand all the people, all the people were all that time.
[time=2804] All the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.
[time=2809] Ezra the scribe stood at a wooden podium, which they had made for the purpose.
[time=2815] It goes on in verse 5 to say, "Ezra opened the book.
[time=2818] Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people.
[time=2823] And when he opened it, all the people stood up." People have asked me, "Why do you have a stand when we read God's Word?" Well, because that's what God's Word teaches us to do, to show it the kind of reverence and respect that only it deserves.
[time=2838] They stood spontaneously.
[time=2840] Then Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people answered, "Amen, amen," while lifting up their hands.
[time=2848] Then they bowed low and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground, because the Word of God was being read.
[time=2860] If you go on to verse 9, then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra, the priest, and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, "Watch this.
[time=2870] This day is holy to the Lord your God. Do not mourn or weep."
[time=2876] Why were they mourning and weeping? Look what it says.
[time=2879] For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law.
[time=2889] You can be seated.
[time=2896] Just a few things I see there that I don't want to just remind you of this morning.
[time=2901] I bring this up because I believe we just need to be careful to give respect and honor where respect and honor are due.
[time=2909] We need to, I think, as a people be willing to just say thank you for the incredible investment that's been made.
[time=2915] When I read this story, when I see God at work in other passages, my friends, when I see the work of the church,
[time=2921] any time I see an anointed or an empowered ministry, there seems to be some things that are always there.
[time=2930] And one thing I want to just remind you of this morning is that there was here in this passage, and there has been here in this place over the last 30 years.
[time=2938] There seems to always be a resilient voice.
[time=2941] There seems to always be one who is willing to stand and speak, not perfectly, but faithfully.
[time=2948] There seems to always be one who is willing to lead and love and shepherd, one who is willing to stand for his people and teach them as best he can the truth of God's Word.
[time=2958] David Jeremiah began that at the beginning of this church's lineage.
[time=2964] What do you know today?
[time=2966] And that's what I'd like to ask all of you here in this auditorium and wherever you hear my voice, what do you know?
[time=2973] And I'm not answering that question with any of the tried expressions with which we often answer it when we are addressed by one of our fellow citizens,
[time=2983] but I'm answering that question from the Word of God.
[time=2986] What do you know?
[time=2988] And what is it that God wants you to know?
[time=2990] In the Word of God today, we're going to study a passage of Scripture that tells us two things we can know for sure.
[time=2997] And in a world of uncertainty, when no one seems to be sure of anything anymore, one of the great blessings we have as believers
[time=3005] is that we have a no-so faith in which we may express great confidence and boldness.
[time=3011] So I trust that you will have your Bibles ready to turn in a few moments to the book of 1 John, and we're going to talk together about what we can know for sure from the heart of God.
[time=3022] He was followed by Rick Hawks. Rick Hawks was followed by Russell Moore.
[time=3026] And now I get the privilege of being here with you along with men like Steve Longbrake and Mitchell Cruz and others.
[time=3032] Plato would reason, does man do good things because he is good?
[time=3038] And does man do bad things because he is bad?
[time=3042] Or is a man good and therefore he does good things?
[time=3049] Or is a man bad because he does bad things?
[time=3053] Which came first? The innate spirit that had a propensity for good or evil?
[time=3057] Or did he do good or evil and that corrupted him?
[time=3061] This passage says it's born in us.
[time=3066] There are basically three themes which leapfrog throughout the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=3072] I want to remind you of those themes because they need to be re-implanted in our minds so that we'll understand the flow of the book
[time=3079] and the significance of these eight verses here on prayer.
[time=3083] You remember that the church at Ephesus, that's where Timothy is, was confronted with some serious obstacles.
[time=3088] They were caught in a pagan culture which was dominated by the temple Diana or the temple Artemis,
[time=3094] full of prostitution, both male and female, and all the pagan cults and fertility rites that were associated with it.
[time=3101] And this was such a spectacular temple that it really dominated all of the culture of the city of Ephesus.
[time=3107] And so it was an ungodly worldly city in which to live.
[time=3112] Beyond that though, they were being corrupted by false doctrine.
[time=3116] There were teachers in their own church and teachers from outside the church which were attacking the purity of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[time=3124] and we're making it into a works religion instead of true faith, true salvation by grace through faith.
[time=3131] We are so honored and it is such a privilege to try to do our best with God's help to be that voice,
[time=3141] but understand again it's a voice, it's our vocal cords, it is and always has been and always will be the truth of God's word
[time=3149] that forms and provides the foundation for what we do and teach.
[time=3154] There's also always been I think as I look at Nehemiah 8 when I look at other passages, when I see God at work in places,
[time=3161] not only is there a voice but there's a response of people.
[time=3165] And I want to thank you this morning and I want to thank the 30, 35 years worth of folks who have always so faithfully responded to that voice, to that teaching.
[time=3177] I want you to note here in Nehemiah there were a couple of responses and I think the responses we see here are worth noting.
[time=3183] Please note that they were and you have always been, so many of you have always been, they were it says a tenive.
[time=3190] That word a tenive speaks to kind of the mental cognitive side of this thing.
[time=3195] They were people here in Nehemiah 8 who were considering mentally what was being said, their minds were engaged.
[time=3204] And that is so important that we would be a people who are attentive to the teaching of God's word, but don't forget not only were they cognitively and mentally considering they were also weeping with their faces to the ground
[time=3220] or their hands raised in praise, they were emotionally engaged at a very deep and passionate level.
[time=3233] There was a balance. It reminds me of what Jesus says in John 4 where he says that God is searching for those.
[time=3240] He is looking for those who will worship Him in spirit and in what? Truth, in both.
[time=3247] And I'm so thankful that you are a people and I'm so grateful that this is a ministry.
[time=3252] And I'm so thankful that the heritage that we've received has allowed us to continue down this road where we are not one as it is in some places where you are going to be one or the other.
[time=3262] Because I don't want to be in the spirit and truth discussion. See, I don't want to just be about truth because I've seen what that does to a place when it's just about truth.
[time=3275] When you're just about truth and you're void of the spirit, you become dry, rule keeping people void of passion.
[time=3285] I don't want to be that. And when you're just about the spirit and you begin to neglect the truth, then you become a people who are absolutely prone to excitement and passion but void of depth.
[time=3302] And you don't want to be that. You want to be both. You want to be a people who respond to the teaching of God's Word in spirit emotionally, volitionally and in truth.
[time=3318] We want to be connected mentally, cognitively and these people give us a great, great example and you have for years and years.
[time=3325] There's a resilient voice and a response of people and Dale said it so well and I'll just end with it.
[time=3332] A biblical message. A biblical message. For 30 years the broadcast has been about that and we will continue to be about that.
[time=3342] And it's not about opinion, it's not about pop culture, it's not about the latest fad, it is about week after week trying our very best with God's help to teach you and explain to you and encourage you with the life changing truth of God's Word.
[time=3360] And from the cradle to the grave around this place, no matter where you go, no matter what season of life you're in, it will always be the foundation of what we do and teach.
[time=3374] The life changing truth of God's Word.
[time=3379] Let me ask Corbin and the team to come on up and as they do I want to read this to you if I could.
[time=3387] Colossians chapter 1, would you all stand with me just quietly?
[time=3399] Just kind of our commitment to you, my commitment to you, our leadership's commitment to you all over again as it relates to this biblical message and this ministry that God's given us.
[time=3410] And Colossians 1.25, let me read this to you, Colossians 1.25 it says of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit so that I might fully carry out the what, the preaching, the preaching of the Word of God.
[time=3433] And so we proclaim him admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom so that we may present every man complete in Christ and that's our hope.
[time=3445] Our hope is that this ministry that God has given us for 30 years, this broadcast and this church, our prayer is that he would continue to allow us the privilege of teaching and encouraging and equipping and we're so grateful for all of you.
[time=3460] You help us do that and we wanted to just end this morning by kind of in our hearts being able to just say thank you to God for an amazing ministry of 30 years.
[time=3470] We also can't come to today September 11th and to see recent events down on the Gulf Coast you know you can't come to today and not just pause and maybe just take some time and say thank God again for this amazing country.
[time=3488] This amazing nation that he's allowed us to be a part of you and I know we have our struggles but again in recent days we have seen a resolve come to the surface again.
[time=3498] And in recent days more specifically we have seen a resolve in a heart among God's people come to the surface in our efforts to help and meet needs and we will as a church have more and more opportunities I'm convinced in the days to come.
[time=3513] But we didn't want to leave today without just taking a moment to celebrate not only our great God but this great country and the opportunity we have to serve and be a part of it.
[time=3523] And so Corbin and the team are going to lead us in a song you know the song and I would just invite you today with grateful hearts to sing it from the bottom of your heart and praise God for what he's allowed us to experience today.
[time=3534] Let's sing and lift our voices to him.
[time=3564] Land that I love.
[time=3570] Stand beside her and guide her through the night with life from above.
[time=3584] Sing that together.
