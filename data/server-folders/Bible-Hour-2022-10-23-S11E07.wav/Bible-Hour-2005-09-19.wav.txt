[time=2245] of you regard one another as more important than himself.
[time=2251] Do not merely look out for your own personal interest, but also for the interest of others.
[time=2257] Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed
[time=2263] in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied
[time=2270] himself taking the form of a bondservant, and being made in the likeness of men, and
[time=2276] being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point
[time=2282] of death, even death on a cross, our Father in heaven, we read those words, and it causes
[time=2294] all of us to realize that only because Jesus was willing to descend, and you sent him here,
[time=2306] that he obeyed you, even to death on a cross, it's because of the reality of that that
[time=2313] we can even pray to you and feel confident that through the blood of Christ we are forgiven
[time=2321] people, and now as forgiven people made righteous by you, we want to have his attitude.
[time=2330] We want to take the form of a bondservant.
[time=2336] We want to serve you and others because you've told us to.
[time=2340] God please help us understand how to do that.
[time=2345] In Christ's name I pray, amen.
[time=2350] Well, if you look there in the text, we want to take you back to the beginning, and what
[time=2358] you're going to see as we go through this passage this morning is three things, and here's the deal, we're trying to make this memorable, we're trying to make this easy
[time=2368] for you to connect with, and we're trying to honor Mitchell, because he came up with the three words, and you'll get that in just a moment here.
[time=2375] If you're going to live, if you're going to discover and live a life beyond yourself,
[time=2382] and I want you to think about this now, for six weeks, if you're really willing, whoever you are, if you would be really willing to consider what God may want to do in your
[time=2392] heart and in your life as it relates to the way you live, the way you think, the way you choose, if you're really open to discovering this life that exists beyond ourselves, there's
[time=2404] going to be three things, especially here in week one, that we're going to want to challenge you with some things that you're going to need to do.
[time=2410] Number one is you're going to need to shrink, and we'll talk about that here in just a moment.
[time=2415] You're going to need you, and I are going to need to shrink.
[time=2419] We're not talking weight loss, we're talking about the heart.
[time=2424] You're also going to need to think, Steve's going to talk to you about that, you're going to need to think differently than you and I are accustomed to thinking, and you're going to in the end then be given the opportunity.
[time=2435] If you'll shrink and think, you have the opportunity to sink with him in a way that really can
[time=2442] make a difference in the way you live your life.
[time=2445] Shrink, think, and sink, hang on, and just listen, I think it'll all come together for you.
[time=2450] Number one, you're ready, you and I are going to have to shrink.
[time=2455] My friends, God's Word says to you and I this morning right here at the beginning of this passage, that if we are going to live a life beyond ourselves, we are going to have to do that in the midst of, we're going to have to make some changes, we're going to have to make some adjustments in the midst of a culture that is absolutely me crazy.
[time=2478] Do you understand that?
[time=2481] That's not shocking news for anybody here, right?
[time=2485] It's not even subtle anymore, right?
[time=2488] This culture has gone absolutely me crazy, whether it's the entertainment world, whether
[time=2496] it's the athletic world, but I don't care what station you turn on, I don't care what movie you go and watch, it's on the news, it's on the sports, it's in the schools, it's everywhere you and I go.
[time=2508] The message is blatantly and clearly and loudly proclaimed, take care of you.
[time=2515] It is about your health and your body and your looks and your fulfillment and your success
[time=2522] and your wealth everywhere you go, it's about you.
[time=2528] Make you better, make you safe.
[time=2530] What about your rights?
[time=2532] It's a me crazed culture and in the midst of a me crazed culture, God's word says to
[time=2539] you and I today that we are going to have to in order to live this life beyond ourselves become others crazed, others crazed, absolutely.
[time=2552] And thoroughly devoted to, focused on, sensitive to, committed to and ready to lift up the needs of others.
[time=2562] The text says don't be selfish, look at verse 3, do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility, direct contrast, but with humility of mind regard, one another is more important than yourselves, don't merely look
[time=2580] out for your own personal interests, but also look out for the interests of others.
[time=2589] Text says don't be selfish, again most of you in the room I think would understand that
[time=2596] the sin of selfishness is the root sin of all other sins, you realize that, it is the beginning
[time=2606] of all sin, selfishness is at the foundation, selfishness is what led the favored angel
[time=2613] in Isaiah 14.
[time=2615] Many of you know that story, the one who became Satan was once a favored angel in the
[time=2622] angelic hosts and he wanted to put his will above the will of God.
[time=2627] It was about selfishness, me being more important, my agenda, what I want in Isaiah 14 you read
[time=2635] about his fall from the heavenlies, the same thing with Adam and Eve, the sin in the garden,
[time=2642] the sin of selfishness, my will, what I want, when I want it, the way I want it, I want it tasted, I want to feel it, I want all that I believe will come with it, me, me, I, I,
[time=2653] selfishness, again at the root and it's been that way ever since and as you study selfishness
[time=2662] in the scriptures and as I look through it this week, I think it's worth noting, listen, wherever you see selfishness, an absolute priority given to my desires and my wants and
[time=2674] my agenda, my will being lifted over gods, remember that though that's true, it's important to see that not only does it serve one's own needs and further one's own agenda, selfishness
[time=2685] always does so to the exclusion or detriment of others because it is always about me.
[time=2694] What you're lacking, what you don't have, the extreme needs you possess I don't see and I don't consider because I'm not consumed with you, I'm consumed with me, selfishness,
[time=2708] I'm governed by what the text says, look back at Philippians 2 there, do nothing from selfishness or what's it say, empty conceit, empty conceit, you may want to write this down, it means
[time=2721] a highly exaggerated view of one's self, see it's so dangerous when you and I begin to function
[time=2729] and live and choose with this exaggerated view of us as if we're really something special
[time=2735] and we really, really deserve all that we would want and demand, it's an arrogant pride,
[time=2742] empty conceit, an arrogant pride, Paul says don't be deceived by pride but look at the
[time=2749] text but in humility, read it there, do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit but with humility of mine, regard one another as more important than yourself, this is so important
[time=2764] my friends, listen this is where the shrinking, this is where the shrinking begins, you and
[time=2770] I are to regard, you see that word there, you and I are to regard others as more important,
[time=2779] now I'd like you just for practical purposes right now to think of somebody in your life who that would be hard to do with, go ahead, I just want you to think of somebody in your world who because of the way they act or because of the way they talk or because of the choices that they've made, somebody in your world who it would be really hard for you to just humble yourself and to just view them and see them as more important than you, maybe for
[time=2805] a while I mean you've just gone the opposite direction and you're so tired and you're so fed up and you're so weary of but think of one person in your life and listen to this,
[time=2816] I want you to look at that word regard from the Greek, here's what it means, it's a Greek
[time=2822] verb that means more than just having an opinion, when Paul says to regard each other as more
[time=2829] important than yourselves, it refers to a carefully thought out conclusion based on truth, it doesn't
[time=2837] mean to pretend that others are more important but to believe deep in one's soul that others
[time=2843] are actually more important, people this is the beginning of this life beyond ourselves,
[time=2851] a willingness to humble yourself, to view others as more primary to shrink, to reduce,
[time=2860] so that they can be cared for, shrinking is where it begins and to live a shrinking life,
[time=2869] it's not natural, it's not normal at all, he wouldn't even have to tell us to do this
[time=2875] if it was natural for us, what's natural is for me to be that selfish, empty, conceited
[time=2881] person that Philippians 2 tells me not to be, that's who I am by nature, it takes forms
[time=2889] sometimes that are little deceptive and people don't always know it, sometimes people even
[time=2896] think you're being good when it's about you, but to live a life beyond me, I need to shrink
[time=2903] back from who I am naturally and I need to be transformed by renewing my mind, for some
[time=2912] of us, no I shouldn't say this one, for some of you that are really smart, for some of
[time=2918] you that are really smart, the tendency would be for you to figure it all out on your own,
[time=2924] the Bible says it's harder for smart people because they become really foolish in their
[time=2930] intellectual pursuits, the simplicity of the gospel doesn't ring as true as early or as
[time=2938] easily to them, and so for you that are really bright, I'd encourage you to think about renewing
[time=2945] your mind because he says you need to or you'll naturally be really slick about how you deceive
[time=2952] yourself and others into thinking that you're being selfless when it's really about them liking you or them later on giving to you what you want.
[time=2964] Life beyond me means that I'm going to think differently.
[time=2969] If I'm thinking in my natural condition, and I know that's selfish and it's about me, then
[time=2976] how am I going to be renewed so that I am different from that?
[time=2981] Look at, look at verses 4 again, O Kelly Red, says do not merely look out for your own personal
[time=2989] interests, but also for the interests of others.
[time=2992] I need to pursue other people's interests, how am I going to do that?
[time=2996] Have the attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed
[time=3003] in the form of God, did not regard, same word, Kelly had, equality with God, a thing with
[time=3010] God, a thing to be grasped.
[time=3013] We're to regard one another as more important as says in verse 3, it says we're supposed to have a humble mind with humility in mind, it says in verse 3, so how do I do that?
[time=3024] Well, the Bible says about itself in Hebrews chapter 4 that this is a living and active
[time=3032] book that the words in here will pierce my heart and help me understand, discern the
[time=3041] attitudes and thoughts of my own heart so that I won't deceive myself or you.
[time=3047] So first of all, I need to understand the vitality of the words in this book.
[time=3053] They're alive and they'll change me.
[time=3056] He says in Romans 12, I urge you therefore brethren and view of God's mercies to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God which is your spiritual act of worship.
[time=3065] Do not be conformed any more to the patterns of this world, that's just doing what comes naturally folks, I don't have to work at that at all.
[time=3073] Do not be conformed any more, the patterns of this world, but be transformed by renewing
[time=3079] your mind with this living and active book, it's powerful.
[time=3088] If you're smart, you'll read this and look for what's simple.
[time=3094] If you're simple, you'll read this and look for what is simple as well and help you change
[time=3100] because in your own, on your own, in your own condition, you'll pursue your selfishness.
[time=3108] So we have to shrink in our attitude, being humble and we have to think really differently,
[time=3116] supernaturally by the power of God, by meditating on, feeding on and thinking about and then
[time=3123] applying the truths of his word, think his way.
[time=3130] Think, think, sink, sink, write it down, that's why NC, sink means, it's short for synchronize,
[time=3139] sin, the prefix means together and cronize comes from cronos which means time, so it means the same time like we synchronize our watches, but think of it this way, the same
[time=3151] timing, the same timing, so we sink our lives and our behavior with Christ.
[time=3161] And what we lift this from is a literary chiasm, it's called a chiasm, and it's a pendulum.
[time=3169] It means that we start at the top and we come down to the lowest point and then we come
[time=3177] back up.
[time=3179] So in verses five through eight, which is what we're focusing on today, is the fact
[time=3185] that God came down to be a bondservant and to die on a cross, the most horrible, torturous
[time=3198] death ever devised by mankind.
[time=3200] There is no greater descent than God dying on a cross as a man.
[time=3208] Think at the verses, who Christ, who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard
[time=3218] equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself.
[time=3225] He emptied his platinum cart of the French benefits of heaven.
[time=3230] Instead of grasping, white knuckling, he emptied, open-handed, a picture of his heart, and took
[time=3237] the form of a bondservant, doulas, a dusty slave.
[time=3243] And being made in the likeness of men, we're going down, see we're going down the ladder.
[time=3247] We started out as God and we're coming down to the bottom of the pendulum.
[time=3250] And being found in appearances, man, he humbled himself to make yourself lower than, to make
[time=3258] yourself lower than, and always has an object.
[time=3263] And on Psalm 113, 6, God humbles himself to creation.
[time=3268] There's something in the heart of God that does this, the gospel message is that God came down.
[time=3275] And becoming obedient, obedient means to listen to the point of death, even death on
[time=3281] a cross.
[time=3284] God comes down, will I sink my life with his.
[time=3294] And what we mean here is serve, write that down, by sinking I mean to serve.
[time=3299] Serving is the beat at which we sink with God.
[time=3318] Which is, Kelly mentioned Adam wanted to ascend when we talked about that first sin in the garden in pride a couple weeks ago.
[time=3327] God's asking us to sink our lives with him and to descend.
[time=3333] So what would that look like for you?
[time=3337] What would it look like to sink your life with God?
[time=3341] God came down for you to sink your life with his, for you to empty yourself, for you to
[time=3347] humble yourself, for you to obey, what would it look like for you to serve?
[time=3354] With your spouse, your spouse says something that kind of tortures up a reaction in you and you're ready to lash back out.
[time=3361] What would it look like God came down, I'll sink my life with his, I'll serve him or her.
[time=3368] You're at work and a peer shoots right up there and ascends and you're ready you know
[time=3376] inside it just cuts against your grain, it cuts against what you learned today and here comes attention.
[time=3381] What are you going to do?
[time=3384] God came down.
[time=3385] Will you sink your life with his and will you serve that person who isn't so lovely?
[time=3392] You might be in a relationship of some kind with went south and you, in your flesh like
[time=3398] Steve talked about you want to lash out.
[time=3402] Maybe they took money from you, maybe they were deceptive.
[time=3408] God came down, am I going to sink my life with his and serve?
[time=3413] What about the poor that you walk by or don't walk by?
[time=3422] God came down and lived the life of a homeless person, the son of man has no place to lay
[time=3429] his head, am I going to come down and sink my life with his?
[time=3437] Serving is the beat at which we sink our lives with God.
[time=3442] It might be religion, are you going to come back down off of that religious legalistic
[time=3449] high horse and sink your life with God's and serve?
[time=3456] I have an iPad, how many people have a pda of some kind, an iPad, a palm pilot, well you know that idea that they're designed to sink with the computer, right, they're designed
[time=3468] to sink with the computer and it's interesting that I bring that iPad in and I put in its cradle and it empties into the server and then they sink because they're emptying into
[time=3482] the server, just what we've seen here.
[time=3486] I found something very interesting, that when they conflict, you got something on the same day at the same time, maybe spell a differently different way, one of them has to be the boss and you got to click a button and say that one's the boss, take his word for it, not his.
[time=3504] And so what I'm asking you to do this week is when that tension arises and you want to us send and you want to do these three things, you want to be right, you want to be against,
[time=3514] you want to fill your cart, I'm asking you to obey God and remember that God came down
[time=3523] and will you sink your life with his and serve.
