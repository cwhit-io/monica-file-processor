[time=299] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I'm grateful for this time that we get to spend together here.
[time=307] And today, there's something on my heart that I've been looking forward to sharing with you and experience I had this past week that I think in many ways probably has forever changed
[time=318] the way I view things.
[time=321] It probably has impacted me, I think, at a level and to a degree that I haven't ever been impacted.
[time=329] I just this past week had a chance to travel with three other pastors from the Fort Wayne area,
[time=336] and we were able to go down on a plane, an individual graciously flew us down to Biloxi, Mississippi.
[time=344] And while we were there for the day, we were able to tour around with an individual we've met recently,
[time=352] an individual who heads up a relief organization, a wonderful guy with a huge heart,
[time=359] and a wonderful organization that's doing amazing things to help these people in that area down there,
[time=367] that area that was absolutely devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
[time=371] We were down there for a day. We went down on Monday, and I was able to, and we were, as a group, able to see in about an eight, nine-hour span of time,
[time=381] destruction and devastation and hopelessness and hurt and confusion
[time=391] at levels that I've never ever experienced or seen in all my life.
[time=396] I'm a decent communicator, but I cannot begin to describe to you what we witnessed and saw,
[time=404] what that storm did, what that hurricane did to that community and those surrounding areas.
[time=410] The level of devastation is beyond words, and as we walked literally through the streets,
[time=417] and as we met people, literally, we're able to walk into their homes and meet people
[time=423] who were there trying their best to hang on. My heart was so moved,
[time=429] and there was something stirred inside of me that I am, I'm so thankful that it got stirred.
[time=436] I just, I can't begin to tell you how looking forward I am to the days I had
[time=443] and the opportunities that you and I may have to continue to come alongside these people.
[time=448] Here's what I want to share with you today. I would love it if you would, as part of our family, or as part of the community of faith here in this amazing city and here in our broadcast region,
[time=458] I would love it if you would be maybe willing to join us in an effort.
[time=463] And here's the effort we have along with these other churches in town.
[time=467] We have decided to focus our efforts in two arenas.
[time=471] One arena is the medical arena. We have, through this organization that we're now partnering with down there,
[time=477] we have an opportunity to send on a weekly basis doctors and nurses, nurse practitioners,
[time=484] anybody in that medical arena, doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, there is a huge need presently for folks like that to go down for a week at a time,
[time=495] and we have the means by which to get you down there.
[time=498] And if you're willing to do that, I want you to just think about it and hang on, I'm going to tell you what to do. On the other side, there's a second arena, and that would be general cleanup, chainsaws and shovels and a little bit of muscle
[time=511] and a whole bunch of folks with busted broken homes that need our help to physically begin to remove things and fix things and clear things.
[time=521] And so on the physical cleanup side and on the medical side, we're asking you
[time=527] to come and be a part of this effort. We're currently working on a number of ways in which we're going to be transporting teams of people down on a weekly basis.
[time=537] But right now, the best thing you can do is go to our website at blackhockministries.org.
[time=541] I mentioned this to you, I think last week, there's a form there that you can click through and fill in as you go, it's a volunteer form, and if you'll give us the information, and on the form, kind of designate where it gives you the chance to talk about what you can contribute,
[time=555] designate either medical or cleanup.
[time=558] And then we'll have your information, and then as these plans come to fruition, we'll be able to contact you and let you know that there is, in fact, a chance for you to go.
[time=567] Can't begin to tell you how desperately they need our prayers and our love and our support.
[time=573] It talks about in 1 John chapter 3, though, how we can't just talk about it, how we have to be willing to have our love and concern for them evidenced in deeds.
[time=584] And so I hope that you'll take us up on this. You'll hear a lot more from me on this in the days to come,
[time=590] and thank you so very much in advance for your kindness and your graciousness and your response.
[time=597] We're thankful for you and can't wait to continue in our partnership of life and ministry together.
[time=604] God bless you. Visit the website soon, sign up, and have a great week.
[time=609] You, I just want to continue this spirit of worship, and let's proclaim once again that we want to lift him high in this place.
[time=639] How low can I go?
[time=644] I am rich to high and proud and low. How high can you be?
[time=653] How low can I go? I am rich to high and proud and low.
[time=661] How high can you be? How low can I go?
[time=691] It's all about you. Jesus, I know this is for you.
[time=715] For your glory and your faith, it's not about me.
[time=724] As if you should do things my way.
[time=729] You know my God and I surrender to you. Jesus, lover of my soul,
[time=751] all consuming fire is in your gaze. Jesus, I want you to know,
[time=769] and I will follow you on my days.
[time=778] Go on else the history is like you, and history itself belongs to you.
[time=794] How far and away you have loved me, and I will share eternity with you.
[time=810] It's all about you. Jesus, I know this is for you.
[time=823] For your glory and your faith, it's not about me.
[time=832] As if you should do things my way. You know my God and I surrender to your gaze.
[time=849] You will not count as surrender to your gaze.
[time=878] Thank you for the cross, Lord. Thank you for the price you paid.
[time=890] Bearing on my sin and shame in love you came and gave amazing grace.
[time=903] Thank you for this love, Lord.
[time=909] Thank you for the hell he used in this.
[time=915] Wash me in your cleansing flow. Now all I know is your forgiveness and embrace.
[time=930] For the is the land, seated on the floor.
[time=942] From your ground we're beneath ground.
[time=948] You make the glory eyes, high and lifted up.
[time=961] Jesus, I'm the God, darling of heaven who is divine.
[time=977] We're the is the land, we're the is the land.
[time=991] We're the is the land, seated on the floor.
[time=1003] From your ground we're beneath ground.
[time=1009] You make the glory eyes, high and lifted up.
[time=1021] Jesus, I'm the God, darling of heaven who is divine.
[time=1037] We're the is the land, we're the is the land, seated on the floor.
[time=1050] We're the is the land, we're the is the land.
[time=1063] How long, how long, how high, how deep, how endless is your love for me?
[time=1104] We're the is the land, we're the is the land, we're the is the land, we're the is the land,
[time=1174] [MUSIC - 378 seconds]
[time=1570] Who makes all things new? He does. He and he alone. He makes all things new. He transforms. He changes. He heals. He restores. He redeems. Ephesians 2 says, he saves. He seals and he sanctifies.
[time=1586] He does it all and you and I need to be reminded of that again and again and again. He is the one who makes all things new and it's the craziest thing, my friends.
[time=1599] It's just the oddest thing. To this day, I still don't understand exactly why when you consider all the components. It really doesn't humanly make sense. And he didn't have to do it this way. But he has this crazy thing.
[time=1615] He has allowed you and I to help. He has allowed you and I to partner. He has required. He has called you and I to partner with him in this greatest endeavor of all. He transforms and he changes and he makes new and he lets you and I help.
[time=1640] And all of his sovereignty and all of his providence and perfection. He takes the one thing that represents hope for a lost and hurting world. The only thing that represents hope, the message in person of Christ. He takes the message in person of Christ.
[time=1656] And he gives it to these twelve uneducated Jewish young men and says, "Upon you, I will build the church."
[time=1667] And the church, he says, the church. Remember, not the building, not the bricks, not the mortar, not state and lame iron so to speak, but you and me, Christ followers, the body of Christ.
[time=1682] He says, "Here, I'm giving you." He gave it originally to those twelve who buy his grace and power and might build and establish the church. And he looks at the church, the bride of Christ and says, "Here, I'm giving the only hope."
[time=1696] The only hope there for a lost and dying world, I'm giving it to you, to teach and proclaim it, to model it, to serve and give it to others, to offer them.
[time=1707] The redeeming life-changing truth of the gospel. He told the disciples and he has told each of us that know him personally to go, to go, to be active.
[time=1719] He clearly indicates the opportunity and privilege that we have in partnering with him in Matthew 28 where he says to you and I, says to the disciples, he says, "Go.
[time=1730] Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them and teaching them all that I have commanded." He could just do himself, but instead he says to you and I, "Go."
[time=1743] He could save, he could serve, redeem and restore, all on his own. But instead he says, "I'll do it through you."
[time=1752] When a small group of high school boys gets a small group leader, he makes things new. When a Sunday school class gets a teacher or a helper, he makes things new.
[time=1762] When a poor struggling widow receives a bag of groceries from a kind and gracious Christ follower, he rekindles hope and he makes things new.
[time=1770] When musicians and vocalists and actors and dancers and artists and the technically gifted use and express their gifts, he makes things new.
[time=1779] When greeters greet, when teachers teach, when leaders lead, when cameramen stand behind cameras, when ground crews lay down mulch, when diapers get changed and when memos get typed, he uses all the above to make things new.
[time=1801] And it is such an absolute privilege. It is such an absolute joy to be able to be engaged in that endeavor, the greatest endeavor of all. It's so good to be in that with so many of you.
[time=1813] I had a wedding yesterday. Maybe I think it was like 10th wedding in the last 15 weeks. It's been quite a summer.
[time=1823] And I enjoy them. I love them. I love being in that setting. And I did a wedding yesterday. It wasn't on site. It was off site. I had a little Lutheran church way out in the middle of nowhere. I had never been there before. I didn't know Cook Road went that far.
[time=1837] I was out there, literally cornfields all around this church on Cook and Oday. And there was this couple. This couple that God has given us the privilege of coming alongside here at Blackhawk in the last two, three years.
[time=1853] Quite a couple. Quite a story. A long one. An involved one. A beautiful story. If God's redeeming work.
[time=1864] And I got to go and be a part of this day with them. And I was so grateful to get to do so. And we did the wedding. And we got done with the wedding.
[time=1874] And I did what I normally do. I just tried to kind of find them down there in the basement with all their friends. And they were high-fiving and hugging and laughing about things that had taken place during the ceremony.
[time=1885] And I just kind of snuck in and just wanted to thank him. And so I thanked him and I thanked her, told him they did a great job and began to make my way out to the car. And in 20 years of ministry, this has never happened.
[time=1895] And not that it should happen. I'm not saying that. It's just never happened. He just caught my eye and he said, "Could I walk you to the car?"
[time=1902] And I said, "Sure. I'd be happy to have you with me." And we walked out to the parking lot. And the moment we got out of the door, he just broke down and began to weep.
[time=1914] He just cried. Couldn't walk any further. Just stood there in the parking lot and just cried.
[time=1919] And I kind of reached out a hand. And as soon as I reached out my hand, he just threw his arms around me, his groom and his tucks.
[time=1926] And he just buried his head in my chest and he just cried. And he kind of pulled back and he composed himself. And now I'm crying.
[time=1933] And I'm not sure what he's about to say, but he just looked at me and just kind of touched my arm. He says, "I just needed to tell you how thankful I am for you and for Blackhawk."
[time=1943] He said, "Thank you so much for all that you all have done. Thank you for teaching me and thank you for loving us and thank you for coming alongside."
[time=1954] And I said, "You're welcome." I spoke on your behalf. I thought, "I hope that was okay." And I just was struck by how lives get touched around this place day after day, week after week, month after month.
[time=1972] And I'm so thankful that we get to be a part of this.
[time=1976] There is a problem, though.
[time=1980] There are some concerns. We talked a little bit about that last week.
[time=1985] And as I look at it, and as we observe maybe the health of the church, big sea, and as I even look at our family here,
[time=1992] you know there are many, many things that I'm so grateful for, so many things that I'm so encouraged by.
[time=1998] But there are some concerns, concerns that we need to address and speak to as we come to this six-week series
[time=2005] on living a life beyond ourselves, discovering the life-changing value of serving.
[time=2013] There is a problem. There are, I believe, too many.
[time=2018] Too many Christians today.
[time=2020] Too many card-carrying Christ followers who would agree with all that we've just communicated.
[time=2026] They would nod their heads in agreement that God makes all things new and that He has, in fact, chosen to partner with us, to flesh out His redemptive work.
[time=2034] They would agree that He redeems and saves and that He calls us to do the work of ministry, the work of serving
[time=2041] and carrying that redemptive message to others.
[time=2045] But today, too many of them are, in their own words, too busy.
[time=2053] It's what I hear.
[time=2059] It's what I get in the notes.
[time=2062] It's what comes across my desk. It's what I hear in the hallways.
[time=2067] Too busy.
[time=2069] Too busy to help.
[time=2071] Too many other things. Sorry. Too many other things going on.
[time=2076] Or maybe I hear I've put in my time.
[time=2080] And I don't just mean senior adults when I say that.
[time=2083] There are some in my age group who I hear saying, for some reason, that their time has been put in.
[time=2091] Too many today that are too busy.
[time=2093] They've got a lot going on. They've put in their time, or they just don't feel like it, or they're over committed elsewhere.
[time=2099] And I want to just say this to you so very lovingly and so very clearly.
[time=2103] My hope and my prayer for these next five weeks has been and will continue to be that those of you who are too busy.
[time=2112] Those of you who have put in your time, who have too many other things going on, that you might catch a fresh glimpse of God's design for serving.
[time=2122] But new opportunities might surface, that new spiritual learnings from God's Word might engage and invigorate tired or wounded hearts.
[time=2130] My hope and my prayer has been that biblical truth about serving inside and outside these four walls.
[time=2138] Please be reminded or hear for the first time today, my friends, that's serving.
[time=2143] The serving life that God has called us to, yes, it transpires on Sundays and Wednesday nights.
[time=2149] Yes, there are classrooms that need to be taught. Yes, there are things that need to be done within the context of this place.
[time=2155] But my friends, a life of serving goes beyond these walls to your neighborhood, to your workplace, to the woman down the street, to the elderly couple on the corner.
[time=2165] God has called us to a 24/7 experience of serving and giving sensitivity toward others.
[time=2176] And yet some would say they are too busy. And so let's each of us. What do you say?
[time=2184] Let's each of us in the room this morning be willing to move from the selfish to the selfless.
[time=2190] To whatever degree you feel, maybe selfish. Maybe you would, in all honesty, admit it to be a lifestyle.
[time=2197] Maybe it pokes its head up every once in a while, I don't know.
[time=2201] But would you be willing to journey with me as we study God's Word from the selfish to the selfless and see what God has for us in this life beyond ourselves?
[time=2212] This morning, let's begin from selfish to selfless, the transformation of a servant. Let's look at Romans chapter 12.
[time=2219] Would you turn there in your Bible's Romans chapter 12 verses 1 and 2.
[time=2226] This morning we'll be focusing really on verse 1. And in honor of God's Word, would you stand with me and allow me to read this to you?
[time=2234] Romans chapter 12 verse 1, it says therefore. Romans 12 1, therefore I urge you, stop right there and remember that word urge.
[time=2244] We've seen that before in other passages that we've studied where you see that word urge, where Paul says I urge you.
[time=2250] It's as if Paul were just going to just get on his knees and he would just implore you, he would beg you, he would plead with you.
[time=2260] He would say Christ followers here at Blackhawk Church, don't miss this one.
[time=2268] I urge you, I beg you, and I stand here today and I do the same thing.
[time=2275] I implore each of us. I plead with you to not miss this truth, therefore I urge you, brethren.
[time=2282] By the mercies of God, your translation may read in view of God's mercies to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=2299] And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=2311] Would you pray with me, Father God, we stand here humbly before you, realizing already, even in these first few minutes, our great need for you.
[time=2323] We need to have motives exposed, God, we need to have our desires assessed, our view of you, God, our understanding of service, all of it, God.
[time=2334] We need a light of your word to shine brightly into the darkness of our hearts.
[time=2343] God allow us to see our humanness move decide, may your spirit and your word come and fill us.
[time=2351] And having been filled with your spirit and your word this morning, God, may we see a life of selflessness, a life of service, a life that goes beyond our own agendas, our own needs.
[time=2363] And God, may you lead us and guide us in that direction and we'll thank you for it in your son's name, we pray.
[time=2370] They all agreed and said, amen, you can be seated.
[time=2375] I would just encourage you to write this down this morning, my friends, the selfish becomes servants.
[time=2380] That's right, the selfish becomes servants through, and we'll see all of this in Romans chapter 12 verse 1.
[time=2386] The selfish becomes servants through salvation, through gratitude and through full surrender.
[time=2392] Let's look at the first point there.
[time=2394] The selfish becomes servants through salvation.
[time=2397] That's right, by salvation, look at the text, it says in Romans 12 1, therefore I, wait, stop.
[time=2404] Therefore, it's very important as we study this text to just stop right there.
[time=2410] And remember, I hope you can remember, we've talked about this in the past.
[time=2413] I hope you've listened, I hope you've learned over the years.
[time=2417] Mitch has stood here and told you this.
[time=2423] Whenever you see therefore, what does it mean?
[time=2428] Whenever you see therefore at the beginning of a passage, at the beginning of a chapter, it means to stop and look where?
[time=2435] Stop and look back.
[time=2436] Stop and realize what you've just seen.
[time=2440] Stop and think about what it is leading up to that point that you've just seen the word of God communicate.
[time=2448] Stop, consider that, and then what you read next, read or study in light of that truth.
[time=2459] The selfish becomes servants, my friends, through salvation.
[time=2463] And chapter 12 verse 1 starts with therefore, so if we're in 12 1, and it says therefore, the question that's asked is,
[time=2472] well then what would, if we were in a study of Romans, what would we have seen in chapters 1 through 11?
[time=2478] Chapter 12 is a definite break in the book's outline.
[time=2481] It begins a brand new section.
[time=2483] So obviously, what had just been communicated and taught in chapters 1 through 11 was very important as we move now to this life of service.
[time=2492] This life of worship, therefore, well you know what, if you looked back on chapters 1 through 11, let me just spare you the study for now,
[time=2503] and I'll just tell you that if you were going to summarize 1 through 11 in one statement, it would be this.
[time=2509] You would see, if you looked back, God, graciously saving, sinful man.
[time=2518] Romans 1 through 11, God graciously saving, sinful man.
[time=2525] Those 11 chapters are packed with the great truth of salvation.
[time=2529] Look at Romans 1, 16, we're going to just fly through these, here you go.
[time=2532] For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
[time=2540] He goes on in chapter 3 for all have sinned and falls short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.
[time=2552] In Romans 5 it says, "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=2559] In chapter 5 verse 6, "For while we were still helpless at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly."
[time=2567] He goes on in chapter 6 to say, "For the wages of sin, wages, wages, what you earn, right, what's coming to you.
[time=2574] For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life." In Christ Jesus our Lord goes on in chapter 8 to say, "Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[time=2589] Chapter 10 I believe, goes on from Romans 8, goes on to chapter 10.
[time=2596] Romans chapter 10, can we get there?
[time=2599] There it is, for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek.
[time=2602] None, for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding and riches for all who call on Him.
[time=2608] And it says in verse 13, "For whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved."
[time=2614] Romans 1 through 11, right there.
[time=2619] God graciously saving sinful man.
[time=2624] You get done with 11, you come to 12.
[time=2628] Chapter 12 verse 1, "Our first text on this life of serving begins with a look back at the great truth of salvation."
[time=2636] Now watch this, and I believe it is an appropriate look back, because true biblical life-changing and life-giving serving can't take place without it.
[time=2651] If we're going to learn about serving, if we're going to learn about biblical servanthood, if we're going to really learn about this life beyond ourselves and this offer that God makes to allow you and I to partner with Him in this redemptive work,
[time=2664] if we're going to learn about serving, we have to start with salvation, because it is the saved who have the privilege of serving.
[time=2674] God's redeeming work takes place through the redeemed.
[time=2680] His Holy Spirit empowered service flows through the saved.
[time=2687] It's important for you and I to take note of this. Without salvation, listen, without salvation you can be nice, you can be charitable.
[time=2699] Without salvation you can even be benevolent.
[time=2704] Without salvation you can do some decent stuff, but it's just not the same.
[time=2712] And that's why we get so excited for those of you who are on that spiritual journey and here asking your questions and you're in the spiritual dialogue and you're considering a life of being fully surrendered to Him,
[time=2729] because I know many of you and many of you help in different ways doing different things.
[time=2734] I just long for the day when you can do more than just help.
[time=2739] And that's not to diminish your help, it's just that it's such an amazing thing when you come to know Him and then you are gifted and freed up to serve in the ways that He has called us to serve.
[time=2750] And you remember this, remember this, serving these good deeds, this redemptive work you and I being willing to put on serving towels and go and do the things that God has given us to do.
[time=2762] It's what He planned from the very beginning for you and I, go to Ephesians 2, would you?
[time=2769] Let me just remind you of what it says, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, go to Ephesians 2.
[time=2778] And I want you to go to Ephesians 2 verse 8, very important that we I think just delineate here the order of how this works.
[time=2784] Sometimes folks get this confused, look at Ephesians 2 verse 8.
[time=2788] It says in Ephesians 2, 8, "For by grace you have been saved through what?"
[time=2794] You and I have been saved through what?
[time=2797] Say it louder.
[time=2798] Faith.
[time=2799] Did anything you do count?
[time=2801] Did anything you or I bring to the table get us saved, yes or no?
[time=2805] No, we have been saved through what?
[time=2807] Faith.
[time=2808] By grace we have been saved through faith, you see it there in verse 8, and that not of yourselves.
[time=2815] It is the gift of God this faith.
[time=2818] Not as a result, watch, not as a result of works so that no one may boast for we are His workmanship.
[time=2826] Here come the works.
[time=2828] The works now come back into the equation.
[time=2831] Do the works come back into the equation as something that gets us saved?
[time=2835] No, now He brings the works back into the equation at verse 10, "For we are His workmanship created
[time=2842] in Christ Jesus through salvation for good works," which He prepared when beforehand.
[time=2849] See, it is not your works and your good deeds that get you saved.
[time=2855] You don't go paint a house and go to heaven.
[time=2858] You don't go give somebody a bunch of money and get eternal life.
[time=2862] You don't help an old woman across the street.
[time=2864] You don't buy a bag of groceries and get redemption.
[time=2867] No, because you got redemption, because you got saved, you go buy a bag of groceries.
[time=2876] You go paint a home.
[time=2877] You go clean some carpet.
[time=2879] You go do whatever it is we're going to go and do because that's what the redeemed do.
[time=2884] They do works and deeds that God prepared beforehand.
[time=2887] And it is an evidence of their salvation, not the proof of.
[time=2891] I hope that makes sense.
[time=2893] Salvation is at the beginning of any conversation about true biblical service.
[time=2901] Number two, write this down.
[time=2902] The selfish become servants.
[time=2904] The selfish become servants through gratitude, my friends.
[time=2911] I want to take you back to Romans 12, and you know what?
[time=2914] You may not in the English translation.
[time=2916] You may not see this clearly, but I tell you, as you study the verse, you see that it is directly
[time=2922] implied.
[time=2924] It says, "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God." Again, your text may read, "In view of God's mercies." The whole idea here is that as you and I would become in view of, as we would on a regular
[time=2938] basis, notice and see and identify the mercy of God that saved us.
[time=2946] That was at work in our redemption.
[time=2948] The whole idea here is that as you view it, as you and I take it in, we are so overwhelmed
[time=2956] by it.
[time=2957] We are so grateful for it that we respond with this act of service, this act of worship.
[time=2968] We were having dinner a few weeks ago at home.
[time=2972] It was one of those rare nights where actually all seven of us were around the table.
[time=2976] It doesn't happen all the time.
[time=2978] It usually doesn't last long, but we were all there and we were having dinner and we were just getting started.
[time=2984] It turns out that nobody had anything to drink, and one individual of the seven realized this,
[time=2991] got up and got seven glasses, filled them up with ice, all seven, filled them up with water, and brought all seven glasses over and put them on the table and spread them out and gave everybody water.
[time=3003] Nobody said a word.
[time=3007] They just kept talking and they just kept eating.
[time=3011] I watched it for just a moment and I went, "Whoa, hold on, time out.
[time=3018] Did everybody just see what happened?
[time=3022] Let me ask you, do you all have water?" They all kind of get shaken out of their stupor and go, "Yeah, yeah, I got water."
[time=3030] Well, did you see who brought you the water?
[time=3033] You know, half said yes, half said no.
[time=3035] They weren't even paying attention.
[time=3038] So I just took a moment right there and said, "Hey gang, we need to say thank you."
[time=3045] Gratitude responds.
[time=3050] Real true gratitude reciprocates.
[time=3054] Somebody just got you a glass of water.
[time=3057] Look him in the eye and say, "Thank you." I remember being a little boy.
[time=3062] Well, not too little.
[time=3063] I remember being eight, nine, ten years old going over to my grandpa Joe's house.
[time=3065] I've told you about grandpa Joe for years.
[time=3067] Grandpa Joe was deaf, couldn't hear a thing.
[time=3069] Quite a guy, though, he could read lips.
[time=3072] Or he could, in this case, he could read the absence of lips.
[time=3075] My grandma would bring me stuff and I wouldn't say a thing and he'd whack me up on the back of the head.
[time=3079] I'd say, "What?
[time=3080] I'm thinking good night.
[time=3081] He's deaf.
[time=3082] How could he..." "Hey, Kay Buck.
[time=3087] Why don't you say thank you?" And I'd say stuff to him like, "You know, grandpa, I'm not a very responsive.
[time=3092] I'd say, "I'm not real good at, you know, what I'm trying to get out of it.
[time=3095] I'm not real good at talking or I'm not real good at responding or I'm not very..." He'd say to me in his big, rough voice.
[time=3102] He'd always look at me and say, "No, it's not that you're not responsive.
[time=3105] You're just not that thankful." Because if you were, you'd respond.
[time=3113] So, in view of God's mercy for you, what's your response?
[time=3123] I'll get a few letters for this.
[time=3126] I know, I always do, but we'll just kind of plug along.
[time=3129] I discipline my kids as a dad.
[time=3132] My wife disciplines are kids.
[time=3134] By discipline, I mean we have a big wooden spatula and we apply it to the backside of
[time=3142] a disobedient child lovingly and privately and with purpose and we pray with them and we
[time=3149] hug them and we get them back in the game, but we discipline our children.
[time=3155] Now listen, you know my kids, huh?
[time=3163] We try not to ever do that mad.
[time=3167] There's times we back out because we know we're not in a good state.
[time=3171] But I learned early on from some folks who taught me.
[time=3175] I learned it even from my own dad and my own mom.
[time=3179] I learned early on that disobedience hurts.
[time=3185] You know that, don't you?
[time=3188] You and I know the pain of disobedience.
[time=3191] And so we've just tried from a very early age with our kids to help them associate the fact that they have choices to make and when they're disobedient that hurts.
[time=3200] That's the wooden spatula.
[time=3203] And I just want to tell you, I don't, you know, I don't go excessive on it, but I just, I use it and it hurts.
[time=3210] And they learned that early on with me and with my wife.
[time=3214] It hurts.
[time=3215] It's not fun.
[time=3216] And then they know we don't enjoy it, but it's not a light, light deal there.
[time=3221] It hurts.
[time=3222] You get the picture.
[time=3223] So now they know.
[time=3225] And so, you know, now when they are at the, you know, we have them go and we sit on the end of the bed there and we come in and close the door and they just know that, you know, when you're walking with that spoon, that spatula, it's just, it's going to hurt.
[time=3237] And so, I also have learned this about God.
[time=3240] Others have taught me this, talks about it in the Old Testament, how He does justice.
[time=3245] And He loves what?
[time=3248] Mercy.
[time=3249] And so there are times and there's no percentage and I don't, you know, think it through prior
[time=3256] to that.
[time=3261] I just kind of tried to let the spirit of God lead, but for instance, just a couple of weeks ago, my jaker boy, man, my five-year-old little man, he was real, this obedient.
[time=3271] And he ended up back on the, on the bed.
[time=3273] And I let him sit there for a little bit.
[time=3275] You know how that is.
[time=3276] You let him sit there and just think about it and you walk in.
[time=3278] And he's already got these big tears weld up in his eyes.
[time=3280] And I always talk him through what they did.
[time=3282] And I helped making sure they understand why we're here and why we're going to do this.
[time=3285] And it's time when I would begin to administer the discipline and I paused.
[time=3290] And he sits there and the tears get in his eyes and he kind of looks at you.
[time=3294] The corner of his eyes and he looks back and he looks at you because he kind of knows all of a sudden because we've been here before what might be coming.
[time=3301] And I look at him and I say, Jake, this time you deserve to be disciplined, but Daddy's
[time=3310] going to give you mercy.
[time=3313] Oh, and the tears he rocked and the hands go up.
[time=3317] And he jumps up on the bed, literally wraps his arms around my neck and squeezes me and sits back down and looks at me and says, oh, Daddy, thank you for mercy.
[time=3327] Thank you for mercy.
[time=3329] And we'll pray and we'll kind of talk that through.
[time=3333] And he knows that that's not always how that's going to go.
[time=3336] But here's my point.
[time=3340] If, as Jake and I were leaving the room that day, I looked down at Jake and I said to Jake,
[time=3347] hey, Jake, buddy, could you help me bring these clothes down to the washroom?
[time=3353] Do you think for a moment that he would look at me and say, Dad, you know what?
[time=3357] I'm a little too busy right now.
[time=3361] I got a lot of things going on, Dad.
[time=3364] I appreciate what you just did.
[time=3366] You know, I've kind of done my clothes carrying for the day.
[time=3371] I mean, come on.
[time=3372] Do you think he's going to say that?
[time=3375] No.
[time=3377] Gratitude in view of God's mercy.
[time=3381] Gratitude reciprocates.
[time=3384] It responds visibly, literally.
[time=3390] True gratitude over real salvation leads my friends to full surrender.
[time=3396] Trove 1, Romans 12, 1, therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies who are in view of
[time=3402] and light of God's mercies, to present your bodies.
[time=3405] To present your bodies in the text, it would mean all of you, all of you.
[time=3410] To present your bodies, all of you, as a living and holy sacrifice that would have been so
[time=3416] significant to them because they would have been very familiar with dead sacrifices.
[time=3419] They would have been very familiar under the law and the stipulations of the law.
[time=3423] They would have had a picture of offering sacrifices, goats, cheeks, bloody, all prepared now.
[time=3430] Christ has come and fulfilled all of that and they offer living sacrifices to them.
[time=3436] All of them, holy and living acceptable to God, which is their spiritual service of worship.
[time=3444] Bodies, my friends, your feet, your feet, sorry, your feet.
[time=3450] Your hands, your minds, your hearts, your souls, your time, your talent, your treasure.
[time=3458] All of it, all the time.
[time=3461] In the Greek, this is written in the present tense, which indicates an ongoing and continuous action.
[time=3467] You can't be too busy.
[time=3471] We don't put in our time.
[time=3475] There aren't other things going on.
[time=3477] There isn't anything else going on as important as the continual, ongoing, habitual, normative
[time=3483] sacrifice of your life, your body, all of it as a spiritual service of worship.
[time=3489] It's the way God designed it.
[time=3491] From greeting at the doors to the flower beds around our property here at Blackhawk.
[time=3496] From painting a widow's apartment downtown to a high school boys and girls small group that needs a leader from the choir that needs more voices to the garbage cans you can take down for the elderly couple across the street.
[time=3509] He calls us to and makes possible by our salvation.
[time=3514] And through our gratitude, he makes possible a life of worship that serves.
[time=3522] Not me, crazed.
[time=3526] Like we talked about last week, but others crazed.
