[time=401] [AMEN] Hi everybody, welcome again to the Bible Hour. It's great to be with you. My name is Kelly Bird and I have the privilege and I mean that.
[time=410] It is a privilege to serve here at Black Hawk as the senior pastor. I have the joy of working with an amazing team and I'm so thankful for this broadcast and those of you who tune in week after week.
[time=422] We're actually finding out these days that there are more and more and more of you who are tuning in. We're so encouraged to see this ministry expanding and I'm so grateful for what God does through the broadcast and through our relationship that we're able to have with you.
[time=439] I want you to know that what you're going to see today is the third part in a six part series. It's a very, very important series. This series I think is one of the most important that we've tackled in recent years.
[time=454] This is a series that we've entitled A Life Beyond Me, discovering the life changing value of serving. We believe that God has called us to a life of giving. We believe God's called us to a life of offering ourselves.
[time=471] We believe that the Christian life, a life of full surrender is a life whereby God empowers us not to necessarily get and take care of ourselves or meet our own agendas.
[time=483] We believe God's called us to a life that allows him to meet our needs while we're freed up to give and offer ourselves to others.
[time=493] Now, I can say that and it sounds good, but you and I both know that sometimes it's a very hard thing to do to actually be and live with an others centered mentality.
[time=505] Today's message, a message that Pastor Mitchell Cruz and I gave to our family here at Blackhawk this past week is a really, really simple, very, I think, profound message.
[time=518] We take it right out of the Book of Matthew and we take it right out of the life of our Lord who models for us in a really powerful way, this heart and this life, this mindset that seizes the opportunities in life to give and minister to and serve others.
[time=537] I hope that you'll watch, more than watching though, I hope that you'll pray, maybe even right now.
[time=544] I hope that you would just take a moment and just say, "Oh God, open my heart and mind to whatever you would want me to see and hear and understand today.
[time=554] God, open my life to a level of serving and giving that maybe I've never known before.
[time=560] My hope is that you would ask God right here in this moment to change you today, to really get deep inside of you and do something very special in your heart.
[time=571] I believe the power of God's Word can do that and I just am so grateful that we get to, guys like Mitch and Steve and I, so thankful that we get to try our best to bring you that Word.
[time=584] And so listen today as you learn a little bit more about the regular everyday opportunities that God gives you and I to serve.
[time=593] God bless you. Thanks so much for tuning in and we'll see you again soon.
[time=598] Can I take your coat too?
[time=600] No, I'll hang on to it for now. This is not the way I remember it.
[time=604] Well, we did some painting recently.
[time=606] And a new rug.
[time=608] We know, don't we? The way things are supposed to be? So we look to make corrections to the system that'll take care of the poor and all the rest who don't seem to have what they're doing life.
[time=619] If we can just make the right adjustments to the system, well then everybody will have what they need, right? A job, a home, a family.
[time=630] And the dishwasher is right over here, although it hasn't been used in quite some time.
[time=636] We're not even sure it still works.
[time=639] Suppose you could try it if you like.
[time=641] Yeah, but make sure one of us is around because, you know, the seals and gaskets will probably leak.
[time=646] We got the sink, then the microwave.
[time=649] The microwave's only three, you know, that's four years old.
[time=652] Right, right.
[time=653] And of course the refrigerator.
[time=656] I guess we don't need to be telling you what's right in front of you.
[time=659] It's fine.
[time=661] Well, okay.
[time=663] Got the pantry around the corner here for canned goods and things.
[time=669] And this goes upstairs.
[time=671] Right.
[time=672] What's this?
[time=673] That's the basement, washer and dryer.
[time=675] This switch and the one over there, that works this light.
[time=679] I'll take care of that right away.
[time=682] Oh, you don't have to.
[time=683] No, I don't want anybody falling and getting hurt.
[time=685] It needs to be done.
[time=687] You're going to want to remember that.
[time=690] Okay.
[time=691] Let me dial you in.
[time=693] This is June and her young friend, Hannah.
[time=698] So this will work, huh?
[time=701] Uh-huh.
[time=702] Down this way is the powder room.
[time=705] The powder room?
[time=707] You know, the commode.
[time=709] The bathroom?
[time=711] Yeah, yeah.
[time=712] Well, there's a tub in there too.
[time=713] And you can take a shower with that contraption.
[time=718] Well, the blue flower is a nice touch.
[time=721] I didn't know you solely boys had such a decorating eye.
[time=725] Paul did that.
[time=726] It's for Hannah.
[time=728] He figured it might be a welcome thing.
[time=731] Bingo.
[time=732] Hey, if you guys need a light bulb, they're up in the top shelf there in the pantry.
[time=740] You don't know how long Paul struggled with trying to find something that would touch Hannah.
[time=744] Yeah.
[time=745] He's a 40-year-old mother hen already.
[time=749] Finally decided on the blue flower, went with a hunch, just like when he stood up in church last week.
[time=757] And your bedroom's right over here, although there's not a lot of room outside the bed, but you got to like it.
[time=764] But that closet there, it's got plenty of room in it, and you can feel free to move things around however you like.
[time=771] Well, we better get things going for dinner.
[time=777] Awkward moments will make you do things.
[time=780] Make you slide into appropriateness.
[time=783] Kind of like the awkwardness you're feeling watching this, lying around your feet like dew on the grass.
[time=788] You're saying, "What's up with this guy?" Well, as Paul's brother, I can assure you there's nothing in it at all, but a heart to bring joy to a child who's facing things.
[time=797] She shouldn't be facing it, 15.
[time=800] Somehow her story got into him.
[time=804] And now he says, "Whatever it takes to bring a little ray of sunshine into her life, no matter how small, a little hope, a little respect, a little love."
[time=818] So, what do you think?
[time=821] It's so weird.
[time=823] I know, honey, but you just have to let it go 'cause these are really weird days.
[time=830] They're nice?
[time=831] They are.
[time=833] A little bit weird at times, but they have hearts of gold.
[time=836] Have you known them all my life?
[time=838] You know, I never would have thought of it, but God has found you a fine place to live for the next few months.
[time=847] June was in Paul's class all the way through high school.
[time=851] June's mom used to joke that the two of them would get married someday, start a family of their own.
[time=857] That never happened.
[time=859] Paul's still a bachelor.
[time=861] As am I, I don't know, maybe it's something in the water.
[time=865] We still go to the same church as June, though.
[time=867] She's a good woman.
[time=871] We have no idea what we're in for.
[time=873] I mean, this house hasn't seen a woman's touch in 20 years.
[time=878] What about then?
[time=881] After.
[time=882] Well, we'll just have to deal with that when we get there.
[time=885] In the meantime, you go to school and work whenever you can.
[time=889] They said they'd take it to the doctor, and if you need anything else, just ask them.
[time=894] You can always call me.
[time=896] Only if I need to, though.
[time=899] I can't take you in, but you can call me anytime, okay?
[time=905] Okay.
[time=906] Hannah's mother won't have her anymore.
[time=909] No other family.
[time=911] June was Hannah's teacher back in the seventh grade.
[time=913] How desperate do you have to be to go knocking on the door of a former school teacher?
[time=919] This little gal's got more courage than her shadow can hold.
[time=923] She stayed with June for a few days, but June's dad lives with her, and he's got Alzheimer's, and it's getting serious.
[time=930] He cornered Hannah last week while she was brushing her teeth.
[time=933] Scared her.
[time=936] Everybody's dealing with their stuff, aren't they?
[time=940] I have to use the powder room.
[time=943] Wait.
[time=944] You know, I don't want you to think that you're a burden to them.
[time=947] They want to do this.
[time=949] They stepped right up and said so.
[time=951] No arm twisting, okay?
[time=958] I'm still not sure.
[time=960] Neither is she.
[time=961] Yeah.
[time=962] You know, sometimes you can't be with things like this.
[time=964] You just have to jump.
[time=966] Well, we sure did that, didn't we, Paul?
[time=968] Yeah, we did.
[time=969] After credit you with that, credit her blame.
[time=971] This is all on you, buddy.
[time=973] No blame.
[time=974] Paul just got tugged by the Holy Spirit.
[time=977] Wasn't any of his doing?
[time=979] Look, do you think she's going to be okay out here with a couple of over-the-hill bachelors?
[time=985] She's going to bring a ray of sunshine to this place.
[time=988] Just you watch.
[time=989] I just want to make her comfortable.
[time=991] She's going to have a baby in three months.
[time=995] I don't think comfortable is what she needs right now.
[time=999] Anyways, thanks guys.
[time=1002] Yeah, it's like Paul says.
[time=1005] We got the room and besides, it's time we started thinking about something else other than car parts.
[time=1009] Don't you think?
[time=1010] We need to, don't you think?
[time=1014] Well, cats out of the bag, she's pregnant.
[time=1017] And a couple of guys who don't know her are going to take her in.
[time=1021] What do you think of that?
[time=1023] Yeah, me too.
[time=1026] But for a second, go beyond what's appropriate.
[time=1031] That's what Paul did.
[time=1033] Go to the fact that here's someone with so little who's carrying so much, and here's a couple of guys who have more than enough and too little to care about.
[time=1041] I know you don't hear about this sort of thing too often.
[time=1045] I know I didn't.
[time=1046] Not until the pastor stands up on a Sunday morning and talks about putting your feet to your faith.
[time=1051] And what's it going to take?
[time=1052] And is God talking to you about this?
[time=1056] And that's when the most unlikely candidate responds.
[time=1060] Mr. Solley?
[time=1062] It's Ron and Paul.
[time=1065] Thanks for the flower.
[time=1068] You liked it.
[time=1070] It's nice.
[time=1072] Hey, just so you know, that bathroom.
[time=1075] That's all yours.
[time=1076] Yeah, and Ron and I will use the one upstairs.
[time=1079] Okay.
[time=1082] Yeah.
[time=1084] Paul stood right up in church and said, "I will pastor!"
[time=1090] Whole church turned around to look.
[time=1092] Jack Behrens was sitting right in front of me and whispered for me to shut my mouth because it was hanging wide open.
[time=1099] See, Paul's not like that.
[time=1100] He doesn't care for people all that much.
[time=1103] And a 15-year-old girl, people are going to wonder.
[time=1109] But I know.
[time=1111] I know it's just God reaching a little deeper into his chest, saying it's time.
[time=1116] It's time to think about somebody else for a while.
[time=1119] You know, he's been wondering why he's taken up space.
[time=1123] Maybe June's mom was right.
[time=1124] Maybe the two of them are starting to put together a little scrap of a family after all.
[time=1128] Well, I should go.
[time=1132] You're going?
[time=1133] I really should.
[time=1134] Well, I thought you were staying for dinner.
[time=1136] Maybe next time.
[time=1137] Are you sure?
[time=1138] You're not going to stay next week.
[time=1140] No.
[time=1141] You'll be fine.
[time=1142] No.
[time=1143] Please, don't...
[time=1144] You'll be fine.
[time=1146] Okay.
[time=1157] Okay, now's that moment that makes you not do things like this.
[time=1160] I mean, is God really calling us to this?
[time=1163] Can he find a woman to take care of our Hannah?
[time=1166] Or a mother that'll take her back?
[time=1168] Or maybe even a classmate's house she can stay at?
[time=1171] No.
[time=1174] Sometimes God uses radical ways to do his work.
[time=1178] A prostitute washes the dust between Jesus' toes.
[time=1182] A famished widow feeds a flake of a man.
[time=1186] Armies fight in battles, walking in circles.
[time=1190] You see, God isn't bound by common sense or today's standards.
[time=1194] He's got a much higher view of things, a much longer vision.
[time=1200] Appropriateness gives way to compassion in the mind of God.
[time=1211] How does Ham and sweet potato sound?
[time=1215] Sounds good.
[time=1217] I'm hungry.
[time=1218] Well, great.
[time=1219] We can't have that now.
[time=1221] No, we can't.
[time=1222] We can't have that.
[time=1223] I'll get the sweet potatoes.
[time=1225] In Jesus' name.
[time=1242] In Jesus' name, I've been changed.
[time=1246] I've been filled.
[time=1247] I've been found.
[time=1248] I've been freed.
[time=1250] I've been saved.
[time=1254] In Jesus' blood.
[time=1256] I've been loved.
[time=1258] I've been cleansed and redeemed and re-released, re-arranged.
[time=1264] But how can I show you that I'm grateful?
[time=1271] You've been so chanderous to me.
[time=1276] How can I worship more than singing?
[time=1282] I live in redemption's melody.
[time=1288] I have been blessed.
[time=1291] Now I want to be a blessing.
[time=1294] And I have been loved.
[time=1297] Now I want to bring love.
[time=1300] And I've been invited.
[time=1303] I want to share the invitation.
[time=1306] I have been changed.
[time=1308] You've been changed.
[time=1312] In Jesus' name, we are changed.
[time=1329] We are called.
[time=1331] We are chosen, adopted, and named.
[time=1337] In Jesus' blood.
[time=1339] We are loved.
[time=1341] We are healed.
[time=1342] We're forgiven and freed of our shame.
[time=1347] And we want to show you that we're thankful.
[time=1353] And fight in your world through open peace.
[time=1359] Help us to worship more than singing.
[time=1365] Giving redemption's hands and be.
[time=1370] We have been blessed.
[time=1373] Now we're going to be a blessing.
[time=1376] We have been loved.
[time=1379] Now we're going to bring love.
[time=1382] We've been invited.
[time=1384] We're going to share the invitation.
[time=1388] We have been changed.
[time=1390] To bring change, to bring change.
[time=1393] Lord, we have been changed.
[time=1396] To bring change, to bring change.
[time=1401] Thank you for this new life.
[time=1404] Thank you for the invitation.
[time=1412] God, we want to live it loud and not to shake the nation.
[time=1420] In your day, we have been saved.
[time=1425] Going to shout about the Savior.
[time=1428] We have been found.
[time=1431] Going to turn over every storm.
[time=1434] We've been empowered to love the world and heaven.
[time=1440] We have been changed, to bring change, to bring change.
[time=1451] And we have been changed, to bring change.
[time=1459] To bring change.
[time=1477] Well, what a powerful drama.
[time=1480] What a picture that vignette painted.
[time=1483] Two guys who were willing to do what we've been talking about for the last few weeks now, as most of you know, we have started a series entitled A Life Beyond Me.
[time=1494] You and I are willing to live lives beyond ourselves, beyond our own comfort and beyond our own agendas.
[time=1500] A life that God has called us to a life of serving and giving.
[time=1503] And what a powerful drama, what a great, great song that kind of captures the very essence and heart behind that message.
[time=1510] We are here.
[time=1511] Mitch has joined me to continue on in this series.
[time=1514] A life beyond me, and Mitch is going to get us going.
[time=1518] All of that in order to achieve what God does in us and through us to serve.
[time=1524] And this is a series on serving, as Kelly mentioned, we're in the third part of a six part series of a life beyond me, discovering the life changing value of serving, discovering the life changing value of serving.
[time=1539] And Kelly outlined three concerns for the church, for those who are in Christ, for the expression of the local body of believers.
[time=1548] And one is that we have to win, that we have to be right rather than gracious or kind, that we have to be right rather than gracious or kind.
[time=1555] And sometimes we get involved in discussions that escalate into arguments and we got to be right.
[time=1562] We got to speak truth and sometimes we're right and ineffective.
[time=1567] And so it's about, not just about being right, but it's about loving and being gracious, undeserved love, unmerited favor.
[time=1575] Second concern Kelly mentioned was that maybe we need to take a look at how often we're against things.
[time=1583] And what if we were not known for what we're against but known what we were for?
[time=1588] For forgiveness, for grace, for mercy, for full surrender, for love, for wisdom.
[time=1594] And then Kelly talked about this image of a shopping cart on how, for us, it can be real tempting as a believer to make a relationship with God all about filling my cart.
[time=1607] Worship music needs to look a certain way, preaching needs to sound a certain way.
[time=1610] God, do this for me, fill me up, let's go.
[time=1615] But what about emptying the cart?
[time=1617] And so in series number one, we look at Jesus as the ultimate example in Philippians two where Paul describes a heart, a heart that shrinks, thinks, and sinks with Christ.
[time=1630] Shrinks our own agendas, thinks with the mind of Christ as the text says, and sink, serve.
[time=1637] God came down, will I?
[time=1640] And then Kelly last week talked about moving from selfish to selfless.
[time=1646] And he talked about how it begins with salvation, with God's work in me by him,
[time=1653] not enough myself, and how that results in an attitude, a gratitude.
[time=1659] And I'm thankful.
[time=1661] And then my life, I begin this journey of fully surrendering all of my life, and that leads us to what we want to talk about today, which is the actual act and the heartbeat of serving.
[time=1673] Serving, what do you think about when you hear the phrase?
[time=1678] What comes to your mind when you hear us stand here before you, two pastors in a church, people in pews, Sunday a.m.
[time=1685] And we're going to talk to you about serving.
[time=1688] See what I think comes to most people's minds.
[time=1691] I know what comes to my mind and has for years.
[time=1693] Whenever you mention serving, I always tend to think about what goes on on Sunday mornings
[time=1699] or Wednesday nights.
[time=1700] My mind typically goes to the activity of serving that takes place within these four walls.
[time=1707] And I want you to hear us this morning say that that's not a bad thing.
[time=1711] That's a good thing.
[time=1712] The ministry and the serving opportunities that presents itself to you and I here inside these four walls is critical and much needed.
[time=1721] There are still openings that need to be filled in the children's ministry classroom situations.
[time=1728] There's still room for folks to serve on technical teams and to help edit videos.
[time=1733] There's greeters that can greet.
[time=1735] There's small group leadership that's needed.
[time=1737] You could lead a small group of high school boys or girls, middle school boys and girls, adults and home groups.
[time=1742] There's choir voices that are still needed.
[time=1744] You could play an instrument in the band.
[time=1746] There's office and administrative help that could be done on a regular basis as a volunteer.
[time=1751] There's all kinds of stuff, meaningful stuff that you and I can give ourselves to inside these four walls.
[time=1757] Our hope today though is that you can begin to understand and see more clearly that serving
[time=1763] a life of giving that goes beyond our own agendas.
[time=1768] That allows us to exercise our gifts and talents.
[time=1770] Our hope is that you would see that it goes beyond.
[time=1773] It includes inside these four walls, but it goes beyond these four walls to the everyday of life that you and I see outside of this place six days a week.
[time=1785] Mitch is going to talk to you a little bit about that.
[time=1786] Ordinary opportunities.
[time=1788] I think they come in two forms.
[time=1790] One are those that fit within our agenda, like family and work.
[time=1794] And those, other ones are agenda adjusters.
[time=1798] So I have our agenda if you want to write it down and then we have agenda adjusters.
[time=1802] Let me just talk about the agenda for a minute.
[time=1804] It's picking up in the kitchen, husbands are cleaning or washing or drying dishes without
[time=1810] being asked by our wives.
[time=1813] It's not making a big deal when we, you know, help out and clean in the house and I say, "Look what I'm doing.
[time=1819] I'm bending over.
[time=1820] I'm picking up this clothes that somebody left out." You know, it's just, it's serving our families as we go through our agenda.
[time=1827] It's the same thing in work, agenda items and the way we serve.
[time=1831] When a car salesman is fair with a customer, he honors God and he honors people and he
[time=1839] serves them because they have a need for a car.
[time=1842] When an attorney draws up an accurate agreement, he honors God and he honors the people he's serving to protect their interest under the law.
[time=1851] When a teacher puts together a good lesson plan and actually the kids learn.
[time=1856] The teacher serve the kids and serve the faculty and serve the administration.
[time=1861] Does that make sense?
[time=1862] This is really clear.
[time=1863] When auctioneer does a really good job auctioning, he serves the people's needs.
[time=1868] But then there's agenda adjusters.
[time=1873] And those are the people who are in need financially, physically, maybe emotionally.
[time=1883] And their paths cross ours.
[time=1887] And we have an ordinary opportunity for our agenda to be adjusted.
[time=1896] And what we're going to talk about today is when we'll serve when those crossroads come, those agenda adjusters.
[time=1905] Here's what we'll see.
[time=1907] God uses ordinary opportunities to achieve extraordinary outcomes.
[time=1914] Write that down please.
[time=1916] God uses ordinary opportunities to achieve extraordinary outcomes.
[time=1932] And our hope this morning, everybody in this room, our hope this morning is that you would today
[time=1938] when we leave this place be a little bit more or maybe a lot more sensitive to these opportunities.
[time=1944] These are opportunities that take place in the everyday of life, my friends.
[time=1949] Moment by moment stuff.
[time=1951] We're talking about in the everyday of life your willingness in mind to as we move along
[time=1957] and as this opportunity and you never know where it's going to come from.
[time=1961] Sometimes it's the most amazing thing as this boom opportunity crosses your path and mind.
[time=1967] And we get a chance to respond.
[time=1970] And our hope is that you can see this morning as we work through this text in Matthew 8 some things that would help you, some things that would encourage you, do that well.
[time=1979] Turn to Matthew 8 if you would.
[time=1981] Matthew 8 verses 1 to 3.
[time=1983] First book there in the New Testament, Matthew 8 verses 1 to 3.
[time=1987] Would you stand with me this morning, with us this morning in honor of God's word, allow me to read this to you and then we'll begin our study.
[time=1994] Matthew 8 verses 1 to 3.
[time=1998] It says here in Matthew 8.
[time=2000] It says, "When Jesus came down from the mountain," and I want to stop you right there.
[time=2005] "When Jesus came down from the mountain," what we have here at the beginning of chapter 8 is Jesus coming off the mountain.
[time=2012] He has just finished preaching what is known as the Sermon on the what?
[time=2017] The Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2019] Mitch and I were talking about this earlier.
[time=2021] The Sermon on the Mount is a dialogue.
[time=2024] It's a discourse.
[time=2025] It's a message that our Lord brought over a span of hours this day, probably to how many people?
[time=2032] Probably 20,000.
[time=2033] Experts would say probably about 20,000 people gathered this day in this valley as Jesus spoke on this mountaintop.
[time=2041] He gives all that he has.
[time=2044] He communicates this great truth of Matthew 5, 6, and 7.
[time=2049] Pours his heart out to the people, delivers this message.
[time=2053] Some of you who teach, some of you who speak know how draining that can be.
[time=2057] I know I go home on Sundays and sleep until about four.
[time=2061] I'm only doing it for 40 minutes.
[time=2064] He's tired.
[time=2067] What an amazing undertaking he's been involved in.
[time=2070] When Jesus came down from the mountain, large, 20,000 or so folks,
[time=2076] do they go home?
[time=2077] What does the text say?
[time=2079] No, they follow him.
[time=2082] When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
[time=2086] And out of the crowds comes this and a leper.
[time=2090] A man with lepercy comes to him and bowed down before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, he's just been teaching for hours.
[time=2101] He's just given himself on this mountaintop." Now he begins to try and move away.
[time=2106] He's followed by 20,000 people and the leper comes and says, "You are the opportunity crosses his path." And he says, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." Point of decision.
[time=2121] How's he going to respond?
[time=2123] What will he do?
[time=2125] Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing.
[time=2134] I am willing.
[time=2135] Be cleansed." And immediately his lepercy was cleansed.
[time=2141] Father, God, we stand here before you this morning asking God that you would give us fresh and new and life-changing insights.
[time=2149] As we look at your truth and as we consider this text this morning, God, I pray, we would collectively pray together, God, that you would reach deep
[time=2159] into parts of our hearts and minds, parts of our thinking, God, that need to be adjusted, parts of us that need to be changed.
[time=2166] God, where conviction is needed, oh, please bring it.
[time=2169] And for those in the room today who have never heard of this, who have never thought of this, God, we pray that the newness of your Word and the power of your truth would continue to draw them to yourself.
[time=2181] Thank you so very much for these who are here today.
[time=2184] May you be honored and blessed, Father, as we do our best to worship you through the teaching of your Word.
[time=2191] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=2193] You can be seated.
[time=2195] I want to just mention to you here as we begin that if you were to ask Mitch and I, maybe what the one thing is that we would want you to catch today, that we would want you to see today.
[time=2205] If there's one thing we want you to take with you today, it would be this.
[time=2209] And it's always interesting, whenever you use as we are today, Jesus, as an example, sometimes folks will kind of immediately check out or at least begin to kind of struggle because you know it's like it's Jesus.
[time=2222] Kelly, what am I supposed to do?
[time=2224] How can I match up to this?
[time=2226] And now not only is it Jesus, but in this text, he does a miracle.
[time=2230] And we just want to make sure you hear us today.
[time=2232] We are hoping today you leave this place having learned from, having been encouraged by, maybe even convicted or challenged by his mindset.
[time=2242] Not so much the miracle.
[time=2245] The miracle is a wonderful thing.
[time=2247] We can come back to that later.
[time=2249] Our hope today is that you would be open to catching the mindset, the heart, the attitude with which he approaches people and in situations and circumstances because that is something that you and I can apply.
[time=2264] That is something that we can take home with us.
[time=2267] Well, let's begin.
[time=2269] Even though he was tired, even though he was spent, even though he had a lot going on, even though he was busy, there's three things that he models for us here.
[time=2278] Mitch is going to take the first, three things that he models for us, that we believe represents a compassionate, gracious, kind heart that's willing to serve and move beyond himself.
[time=2288] Mitch, take number one.
[time=2289] The first thing that we see if you want to write this down is he's aware of the need.
[time=2294] He's aware of the need.
[time=2302] Look at Matthew 8, verse 1.
[time=2304] And when you come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
[time=2308] 20,000 people bumping into him.
[time=2311] You know, there have been people saying, all right, this is how we're going to get the word out.
[time=2315] Jesus is a Messiah and we're looking for a political, governmental revolution.
[time=2321] And here's how we do it.
[time=2323] I'm going to get with these people, those people and the influential people and the leaders, and we're going to get the word out.
[time=2329] Well, you know, it's the same way for you and for me.
[time=2334] Everything around us in our culture, which stems from the Greek culture back then, tells us there's a certain way to do things, a certain way to move up, a certain way to move up the corporate ladder, a certain way to be seen, a certain way to be heard.
[time=2348] And again, it comes back to making life about me.
[time=2352] It's even the same in ministry.
[time=2354] If you do ministry this way, then everybody will see it and they'll know it.
[time=2357] And then we'll get this thing going and it'll get bigger and bigger and bigger.
[time=2361] But look at verse two.
[time=2365] And we see that there's another way.
[time=2368] And it's when you let your agenda get adjusted.
[time=2372] And many ways for Christ is always available to be adjusted.
[time=2379] And behold, the leper came to him and bowed down to him saying, "Lord, if you are willing,
[time=2385] you can make me clean." Wow.
[time=2392] Leprosy.
[time=2394] Leprosy was just the worst kind of thing that could ever happen to a person.
[time=2402] It came suddenly, like what happened literally overnight.
[time=2407] It would be about the size of pin heads or needles on your face, little dots
[time=2414] that would start around your eyes and your nose.
[time=2417] And there were three kinds, red, white and black, depending on the color.
[time=2422] And then it would, over a period of years, the little dots, little bumps would get bigger
[time=2429] about the size of a pea or a bean.
[time=2433] And then it would spread all over the skin of your body.
[time=2440] And it wouldn't stop there, it would go down into your bones and into your marrow.
[time=2446] And it would literally, lepersy would literally eat you alive.
[time=2451] The pain was excruciating.
[time=2454] And because of leprosy, you had to be isolated from the community.
[time=2458] We see this in Leviticus 13 and 14.
[time=2460] You had to be isolated from the community.
[time=2463] You were defiled.
[time=2464] And when people got anywhere close to you, you had to cover the bottom of your mouth because lepersy wasn't contagious.
[time=2471] And it was also hereditary.
[time=2472] It could go for generations.
[time=2474] And you'd have to shout if someone got close to you, "Unclean!
[time=2477] Unclean!" You're being eaten away, eaten alive.
[time=2485] And I think about this.
[time=2487] You got these 20,000 people saying, "Jesus, let's go.
[time=2490] Let's do it this way.
[time=2491] Here's our agenda.
[time=2492] Here's the way we do it.
[time=2493] Here's the Greek culture.
[time=2494] We're going to move up." And then an agenda-adjuster comes and says, "If you're willing, you can make me clean."
[time=2507] And you know, it's that same way for us.
[time=2511] Every day, we walk by agenda-adjusters.
[time=2516] People in physical need, financial need, emotional need.
[time=2520] And they're really saying, and might not say it in words, but they're saying, "If you're willing, you can make me clean.
[time=2528] If you're willing, you can make me clean." You know, Luke's account of this, and Luke 5, says that this leper fell face down.
[time=2537] And I thought about the pain that he would have gone through just to get there and end up face down before Jesus.
[time=2544] The all pride had been stripped away, and he heard, and he says, "If you're willing, you can make me clean."
[time=2554] You might say, "Well, how do I do that?
[time=2555] How do I be aware in my own life?
[time=2557] How do I become aware?
[time=2558] It's real simple.
[time=2559] When we come to the crossroads of an agenda-adjuster, a crossroads where their path meets with ours,
[time=2566] what we do is exactly what we tell our kids to do when they come to a crossroads in the street.
[time=2570] Stop it down, stop, look, and listen.
[time=2575] Write it down.
[time=2576] Stop, look, and listen.
[time=2577] Stop.
[time=2578] Stop our own agenda.
[time=2580] Much of what happens in our day is this has been designed by us, may be prompted by God, may be not.
[time=2587] And when an agenda-juster comes by, somebody needs a roof, somebody needs their lawnmower, a widow that needs her leaves rake.
[time=2595] Stop your own agenda, or a door that just needs to be opened.
[time=2599] Or a door that just needs to be opened.
[time=2600] Garbage can that might need to go down the driveway.
[time=2604] Big, little, small stuff, just the everyday stuff.
[time=2609] Ordinary opportunities, and do what Jesus did.
[time=2612] Look.
[time=2613] Look at the need.
[time=2615] Look and see the person's need.
[time=2619] Like Kelly said, a door that needs to be opened.
[time=2622] Garbage needs to be brought down the driveway.
[time=2624] Whatever it is.
[time=2625] And then listen, listen to two things.
[time=2627] Listen to what they're telling you.
[time=2629] They may not be using words, but then also listen to the Holy Spirit.
[time=2635] Listen to that whisper of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2638] It's probably saying stop your own agenda.
[time=2641] Look at the need and listen.
[time=2643] And when we do that, when we're aware of the needs around us like Jesus was, ordinary opportunities are used by God to achieve
[time=2651] extraordinary outcomes.
[time=2653] We mentioned this first hour, and I think it's worth mentioning it again.
[time=2656] We would, Mitchell and I would encourage you.
[time=2658] We've both done this in recent days, and God has responded to our request.
[time=2663] We have begun to pray, and I didn't used to.
[time=2667] I'm sorry, but now I've started to.
[time=2670] I've started each day, or most days, I begin by asking him in my time with him, among other things that he and I talk about.
[time=2677] One of the things I have started to ask God to do is just the simple prayer, "God, make me aware."
[time=2684] Oh, please, God, make me more aware.
[time=2687] Help me see what I need to see.
[time=2689] Help me notice what I need to notice.
[time=2691] God, give me the whisper from your spirit to know what to do when this comes across my path.
[time=2697] God, I cannot begin to tell you.
[time=2699] Mitchell would say the same thing.
[time=2701] The years that we spent moving through life, missing.
[time=2705] Everyday ordinary ops.
[time=2708] To do something that was needed.
[time=2711] To do something that would have been called for.
[time=2713] To do something that would have evidenced his gracious, compassionate spirit.
[time=2718] He was aware, my friends.
[time=2720] Number two, write this down.
[time=2722] He connects.
[time=2723] He's aware, and he connects.
[time=2725] Don't miss this.
[time=2726] He connects, and my friends, he doesn't just connect, connect.
[time=2729] He connects, I believe, and the text indicates, I believe, at a very, very deep, very personal,
[time=2736] very meaningful level.
[time=2738] Look what it says, and when Jesus came down, large crowds followed him, and a leper came to him and bowed down before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." And here you have it, right here.
[time=2748] Jesus, point of decision.
[time=2750] What does he do?
[time=2751] He stretches out his hand.
[time=2753] And I want you to stop right there.
[time=2755] And I just want you to realize, and I want you to recognize, that the stretching out of the hand, when there were so many places to go, and there were so many things to do, and there were so many people to see, when he stops and stretches out his hand, he is connecting
[time=2772] with the opportunity, he is exercising and evidencing compassion.
[time=2777] Here's a word for you, I believe, he is modeling for you and I, empathy.
[time=2782] Write down the word empathy.
[time=2785] Define the word empathy in your own mind right now.
[time=2788] What does empathy mean?
[time=2790] When you empathize with someone, what do you do?
[time=2794] I'll help you out here a little bit.
[time=2796] To show empathy, to exercise empathy, it's when you, it's when you look at me, in my condition,
[time=2804] it's when you having stopped and looked and listened, and when you take in the reality
[time=2810] of my circumstance, you feel deeply.
[time=2816] You, having listened to me, having observed me, you feel deeply.
[time=2823] My pain or my loss or my struggle or my confusion.
[time=2830] It's you being willing to stand in my shoes and emotionally and literally feel what it must
[time=2837] be like to sense what I sense and have to walk the road that I'm walking.
[time=2844] He connects, he empathizes, cannot, I can't talk about that.
[time=2853] And my mind not go to John chapter 4.
[time=2857] Bob Purdy sent me an email this week and reminded me, and it was, it's just such a good, turn
[time=2863] to John 4, pick it up in verse 7.
[time=2866] You want to see empathy, you want to see compassion, you want to see Jesus watch this.
[time=2870] You want to see Jesus seeing into a circumstance and being willing to connect and respond.
[time=2878] Look at John 4.7, there came, there came a woman of Samaria.
[time=2883] Jesus has stopped at this well, the disciples have gone into the city.
[time=2887] There came a woman of Samaria to draw water, and Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink." The disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
[time=2895] Therefore the Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you being a Jew ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan?" Samaritans and Jews had nothing to do with each other.
[time=2907] There was a racial ethnic thing going on here that was bitter and longstanding.
[time=2913] Jews didn't talk to Samaritans, and Samaritans certainly didn't talk to Jews, and then on top of that she's a woman.
[time=2920] Why would you stop in the midst of your day?
[time=2924] Why would you stop and speak to me?
[time=2928] Why would you stop and ask me a question?
[time=2930] Why would you stop and engage me in discussion?
[time=2937] When Ohai did, he seized into the circumstance.
[time=2941] He observes and go down to verse 16.
[time=2947] He said to her, "Go call your..." Jesus says in the essence, "Okay, I'll tell you why, watch this." He says, "Go call your husband, and come here." And the woman answered and said, "I have no husband."
[time=2964] Jesus said to her, "You have correctly said I have no husband, for you have had five husbands.
[time=2971] And the one whom you now have, the one whom you're living with, the one whom you're sleeping with, is not your husband.
[time=2978] This you have said truly." And I don't think for a moment he said that judgmentally.
[time=2985] I don't think for a moment he said that harshly.
[time=2990] I don't think he was castigating her.
[time=2992] I don't think he was calling her out, I think, with all the love and graciousness and sensitivity and gentleness.
[time=2999] I think he spoke the truth, and in doing so he sees into the circumstance and he connects, he stretches out his hand and he says, "Hey, I'll tell you why.
[time=3008] I'm talking to you because I love you and I want to give you, I want to quench your thirst."
[time=3014] You're obviously going the wrong place, trying the wrong things.
[time=3017] And he offers her life and as the story progresses it's an amazing text.
[time=3022] But he sees people, he sees into the circumstance.
[time=3025] And he stretches out his hand and he connects.
[time=3029] He's aware, he connects.
[time=3031] You say, "You say to me, I say to you." That sounds really this whole empathy thing.
[time=3035] Really, really like really feeling someone else's pain in the midst of my life as fast as I'm going, as quickly as I'm moving.
[time=3043] With all the stuff I've got going sounds foreign, sounds very strange, sounds very difficult.
[time=3049] And I would say you're right, you know what it sounds too foreign.
[time=3052] It's become too strange for us because you don't exercise empathy and you don't connect
[time=3059] real well in a hurry.
[time=3062] Takes a little bit of time.
[time=3064] He was aware.
[time=3065] He connects.
[time=3066] And number three, wow, he touches.
[time=3070] You know, Kelly, I was sharing with you that I came across this that the aware things kind
[time=3078] of a matter of the eyes and the ears.
[time=3081] The connecting thing is really a matter of the heart.
[time=3083] And in Mark's account in Mark 1 verses 40 through 45 of this same Matthew 8 passage, Mark says
[time=3090] that he was filled with compassion.
[time=3093] That Jesus in this moment with a leper was filled with compassion.
[time=3097] I came across this little interesting bit of information that in the Greek, they could
[time=3103] have chosen a very common word for this situation and it's what we would translate mercy.
[time=3108] You know, he could have been merciful.
[time=3110] He could have felt mercy.
[time=3112] Then there's another word and that's pity.
[time=3115] He could have just had pity.
[time=3116] Very common word to use for this.
[time=3118] But the writer, Mark, chose to use filled with compassion, one word in the Greek, filled with
[time=3125] compassion.
[time=3126] Compassion, calm meets together and passion and suffering come from the same Latin root, which
[time=3134] means to suffer.
[time=3135] So passion and suffering, compassion means to suffer together inside my heart for that
[time=3141] other person.
[time=3142] And that's what Kelly's talking about, about empathy.
[time=3145] So we're aware of the need with our eyes and our ears.
[time=3149] We connect with the heart and then Jesus touches or he serves, which is a matter of the hands.
[time=3158] He touches or he serves, which is a matter of the hands.
[time=3163] Look in verse three and he stretched out his hand and touched him saying, "I am willing." There's this heart, "Be cleansed." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
[time=3180] How many people are around us who are saying, are saying, "If you're willing, make me clean."
[time=3192] If you're willing, I've been a widow for many years now, could you put in the wheelchair
[time=3199] ramp?
[time=3201] If you're willing, would you make me clean?
[time=3203] If you're willing, would you paint this room that never got painted?
[time=3208] If you're willing, would you make me clean?
[time=3210] How many agenda adjusters are in our paths and provide us the opportunity, and they may
[time=3217] not be, they're probably not saying it with words, if you're willing, make me clean?
[time=3223] And it's our opportunity to be the hands of Christ.
[time=3227] And this whole scenario here in the Bible got me thinking about what happens when the
[time=3235] hands of Christ touch someone who's untouchable?
[time=3243] What happens when the hands of Christ touch someone who's untouchable?
[time=3248] And this question kept going through my mind, do they become more aware of their need for God?
[time=3255] When the hands of Christ touch the untouchable, do they become more aware of their need for God?
[time=3266] And I think, you know what?
[time=3267] I think so.
[time=3268] Because, you know what, Jesus tells the leper in verse 4, he said, "Go straight to the priest," which was the law.
[time=3274] Leviticus 13 and 14, "Go straight there.
[time=3276] Do not pass, go.
[time=3277] Do not collect $200.
[time=3278] Go straight to the priest and tell him what happened." There's a couple reasons probably.
[time=3282] Number one, Jesus didn't want an opponent to beat him to the priest.
[time=3284] It was 50, 60 miles away to Jerusalem, and he didn't want him to discredit the miracle.
[time=3290] Number two, Jesus didn't want a political revolution.
[time=3294] But you know what?
[time=3295] The text tells us the guy didn't do it.
[time=3297] In Mark 1, it tells us that the guy went telling everybody, "I'm clean, I'm clean."
[time=3305] And so, I think it's really clear that when the hands of Christ touch the untouchable,
[time=3315] they become aware of their need for God, whether skeptic, whether seeker, whether surrendered.
[time=3321] There's something about the church, the body of Christ, when we're the hands, and we touch and serve the untouchable, that they become aware of their need for Christ.
[time=3330] And we don't do it for an agenda.
[time=3332] We don't do it so they'll look a certain way or act a certain way.
[time=3335] We do it because Jesus Christ in Mark 1045 said, "I didn't come to be served, but I came
[time=3342] to serve and give my life as a ransom for many."
[time=3348] So are we?
[time=3348] That's right.
[time=3350] Are we the body of Christ going to be the hands of Christ and not expect to be served, but to allow the agenda, just as when they crossed our paths, will we serve and give our lives?
[time=3362] And so when we paint a fence, when we open a door, when like I hope this week, when a
[time=3373] girl gets who's thinking about having abortion gets taken to a hope center and sees an ultrasound,
[time=3380] when a group tours a Wellington home and sees a group of people who are committed to touching
[time=3386] the untouchable, women who have had babies and have no place to go, somebody goes to the rescue mission and serves a meal to someone who doesn't smell good.
[time=3398] When somebody's willing to take time out of their busy schedule to go and sit with a
[time=3406] woman at the Kerris House who's been abused and is running from a deranged spouse who's
[time=3413] trying, I mean, all kinds of opportunities.
[time=3417] And don't forget the Sunday school class.
[time=3419] And don't forget the administrative help in the office that's needed, member, inside and outside, regular, ordinary opportunities.
[time=3427] And God will use, absolutely, those ordinary opportunities to achieve extraordinary outcomes.
[time=3436] It's amazing, you know, just to not belabor it, but just remember this, if there was one thing you'd never, ever, ever, ever do with a leper, and if there's one thing you would
[time=3446] never, ever, ever do with a leper, it would be to what, to touch it.
[time=3454] Kelly, I don't think I said that when the guys running out saying I'm clean, I'm clean and clean, and Mark it tells us that such crowds started following Jesus that he couldn't enter a city publicly anymore.
[time=3465] Right.
[time=3466] He was saying, you know, that when we do that, when we touch the untouchable, there's something that happens that God does.
[time=3472] Yeah.
[time=3474] He was willing to just write this down or actually look at what you've written down.
[time=3477] He was willing to act.
[time=3478] You see that?
[time=3479] He was aware.
[time=3480] He connected.
[time=3482] He touched.
[time=3483] He was willing when the ordinary, everyday opportunity crossed his path.
[time=3488] He was willing to act.
[time=3490] Are you?
[time=3490] Are we 24/7?
[time=3493] Yes, on Sundays and Wednesdays, we need your help, but when you leave this place, there's a waiting world out there, and God will bring them right across your path, one after the other.
[time=3502] Some will be small, some will be medium, some will be big, the opportunities will be varied.
[time=3506] But our hope is that you would every day in every situation that you would view every encounter as a divine appointment.
