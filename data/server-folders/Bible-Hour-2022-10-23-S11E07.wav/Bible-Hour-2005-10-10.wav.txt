[time=1212] [MUSIC - 83 seconds]
[time=1299] - I'm thankful for all the preparation that Corbin and all this team does all the time to lead us in singing our praises and worship.
[time=1309] It's great.
[time=1310] It's especially nice when he schedules my daughter to sing.
[time=1314] I really like that part.
[time=1316] Our daughter, Stephanie, Nancy and I, she's been Nancy's daughter for the past seven years.
[time=1326] She's also her mom's daughter.
[time=1331] Her mom is in heaven, wherever that is.
[time=1335] Often when she gets to sing or do something like that
[time=1341] that I know Renee would just be bursting with pride.
[time=1344] Nancy is too.
[time=1345] I love that about you.
[time=1347] I think about, you know, can her mom see that?
[time=1353] Can she hear that?
[time=1357] People, those of you that had somebody die, you'd find yourself talking to them once in a while and even say it out loud and you, then you wonder, can they hear it?
[time=1366] Do they know what's going on?
[time=1366] We don't know much about what's going on there.
[time=1370] I was with a guy whose wife had died and he was much older and wiser than me.
[time=1375] And I was telling him, you know, sometimes I kind of feel like a nut.
[time=1378] You know, this was saying things out loud to somebody who's died.
[time=1382] And he said, he said, I don't know.
[time=1384] He said, I figured that one out.
[time=1385] I said, what is it?
[time=1386] He said, we don't know if they can hear us or not, but we know who can.
[time=1390] And if he wants to tell him, he can.
[time=1395] We don't know if they can see us or not, but we know who can.
[time=1400] And if he wants to tell them what he sees, he can.
[time=1403] That's a, that's really comforting, isn't it?
[time=1406] Felt good.
[time=1408] So today I'm hoping that the thing, she was the blonde one here that looks like me without a beard.
[time=1416] (audience laughing) Fortunately, she's a lot prettier than I am.
[time=1423] What?
[time=1427] Me a minister, I want you to think about him seeing and hearing, we know he does, all through this message.
[time=1436] He sees and he hears.
[time=1440] What, me, a minister of his?
[time=1443] That's the question today.
[time=1446] What, me, a minister?
[time=1448] I remember in my childhood at our church, the only person called a minister was the person who got paid to do it full time.
[time=1456] And I grew up thinking that if you were gonna be in the ministry, it meant that you got paid by people to think about God all the time and do God's work.
[time=1471] We called him the minister at our church.
[time=1474] And then I got in some other churches where they didn't call the person who did that, the minister and I wondered why.
[time=1482] And then I looked at the passage of the scripture that talk about ministry and who the ministers are.
[time=1487] And I realized, you're the minister.
[time=1491] If you know Jesus Christ as your savior, if you've been chosen by God and our child of his, you're a minister from that point in the rest of your life, you're a minister of the gospel.
[time=1507] You get elevated to it 'cause it doesn't matter what the job is, the job can be the lowest job in society, from culture.
[time=1514] As a matter of fact, those may be the highest jobs.
[time=1517] Our culture may see those as, but when you're doing it for him and you're ministering to people, in order to reach the lost and in order to build up the saved, when you do that, that's a high calling.
[time=1532] As a minister, what, me a minister?
[time=1535] Yeah, you're a minister.
[time=1537] This is what Luther said.
[time=1538] While the outer man labors, the heart of the new man says,
[time=1550] he makes in treaties with the Lord.
[time=1552] The heart of the new man makes in treaties with the Lord, begging the Lord.
[time=1559] Says, as his cares press upon him, he says, I follow thy calling.
[time=1568] I know Luther didn't say thy, so I don't know how this guy wrote that, Luther said something in German, but he said, I follow thy calling, therefore I do all things in thy name.
[time=1582] I follow thy calling to the marketplace,
[time=1590] in my neighborhood, in my house, at church.
[time=1595] I follow the calling that you have called me to as a minister of the gospel.
[time=1606] Don't you just feel something when you realize that you're called by God to a vocational calling that's ministry, to a household that's called to be the place where you get to minister, to the neighborhood, where you get to be the minister.
[time=1623] And some people say, I don't feel much like a minister.
[time=1631] And some reasons that I don't serve in roles of ministry are these.
[time=1635] Let's look at a few.
[time=1637] Some reasons I don't serve.
[time=1639] I don't feel worthy.
[time=1643] Well, if you're waiting for that, you'll never serve.
[time=1647] It's not gonna happen because we aren't worthy to serve him or each other.
[time=1654] I don't feel worthy.
[time=1658] You're made worthy by the blood of Christ.
[time=1664] He paid the penalty for you're not being good enough.
[time=1668] Bade you in it, forgave you so that you can sense forgiveness.
[time=1675] You need to know you're forgiven when you have received the debt payment of Christ's blood.
[time=1682] When you repent and say, then you need to sense that.
[time=1687] You need to know that.
[time=1690] You're worthy because he's worthy.
[time=1692] That's the only reason.
[time=1695] Or I don't have time, number two.
[time=1698] Some people say, I'd like to, but you know what?
[time=1703] Just I put a lot of, I'm really busy.
[time=1707] That word's pretty commonplace today.
[time=1711] I'm busy.
[time=1712] I don't have time.
[time=1716] I'm doing this, that, and the other.
[time=1718] And I don't have time.
[time=1719] Well, let's listen to this.
[time=1721] Minister, while you're doing this, that, or the other.
[time=1725] Realize your opportunity to do ministry isn't just a program that we put together in our local church.
[time=1736] Your opportunity for ministry is every day, all day.
[time=1740] And while you're doing this, that, and the other, be the minister that God designed you to be.
[time=1745] And I'd also say this, carve out some time to do one of the things that your local church is doing.
[time=1754] Carve out some time, subtract something, to do something outside the local church.
[time=1759] Do one in both arenas, where you're light there in your edification building up people here.
[time=1767] You got time, the same amount everybody else has.
[time=1772] Number three, I've already put in my time.
[time=1780] It used to be that people were about 70 when they said that.
[time=1784] And then I've watched in my lifetime as that just keeps going down.
[time=1788] There are a lot of 45-year-olds that feel like they've done their duty.
[time=1792] I'll tell you when you've already put in your time, when the last one of these occurs, (screaming) then your time's up.
[time=1810] But until then, you have opportunities to minister in every setting of your life.
[time=1818] You have all the time, and you know what?
[time=1820] You need to keep thinking about that I've done my part, I hope then, I hope I get a chance to do my part for the rest of my time, for the rest of my breathing time.
[time=1831] And then, I don't know what it's gonna be like, but I believe with all my heart, we're gonna be working for eternity.
[time=1838] 'Cause he designed us to work, and to enjoy work.
[time=1842] I've not had more fun, and in years than I had yesterday morning with my team.
[time=1848] No, with Doug's team, no, with God's team that I was on.
[time=1852] I had a blast there yesterday, mostly.
[time=1855] They came with that camera, they didn't show it, thank you so much, Ed or Mark, or whoever edited that.
[time=1861] They show up at our place, I'm the only one drinking a cup of coffee, and I've been working really hard before that.
[time=1868] I had a little cinnamon roll and a cup of coffee, and Mark Archer shows up with that camera.
[time=1873] What nerve to come then?
[time=1874] I had a great time though working too yesterday.
[time=1879] It was so good to watch, as people use their gifts.
[time=1884] My gifts are limited when it comes to that stuff.
[time=1888] My garage is full of mechanical equipment and tools.
[time=1892] It's tools to work on engines and I like that kind of stuff, 'cause usually it's not the detail stuff, you know?
[time=1898] And when it is, I have to call somebody else to do it.
[time=1900] I can only do like one inch nuts and bigger.
[time=1903] (laughing) I like those kinds of tools.
[time=1907] I'm not, so yesterday I got to...
[time=1909] Barbell and I did, and Christian did a lot of boards for the ramp of this wheelchair ramp that we were doing, and we put the screws in, I could handle a drill and...
[time=1919] And man, but you know what, we kept doing that, and somebody else was, Steve was measuring and cutting, 'cause he could do that, and Doug was supervising the whole thing and working at the same time, 'cause he could do that.
[time=1930] And everybody had a different role there, and Ty was able to do a lot of stuff.
[time=1934] He's done it around here a lot.
[time=1936] We had all kinds of different, differently gifted people,
[time=1942] uniquely gifted to do, and we got done.
[time=1945] There was a ramp there.
[time=1947] (laughing) There was a ramp.
[time=1952] And Charlene, who'd read the Scriptures with us before, oh my goodness, did she like that ramp.
[time=1960] And more than that, do you hear what Corbin said when he got up, finished with the video?
[time=1966] Did you notice all those people worshiping around town at those tabernacles?
[time=1970] That's what he said.
[time=1972] 'Cause when you do works of service for the living God, you are worshiping him, and that's what was going on yesterday.
[time=1980] You haven't already put in your time, folks, until you've breathed that last breath.
[time=1984] Don't do what John Piper, I love what he says.
[time=1987] He admonishes his people.
[time=1988] He says, yeah, you can go on vacations to Florida, you can do, and you can.
[time=1992] You can go there for the winners, and I don't mind that.
[time=1994] Just don't think that your shell offering at the Bemisin, he's gonna say, what do you have to show me?
[time=2000] Don't show him what your collection, your shell collection, and think that's what he's expected out of you the last 30 years of your life.
[time=2009] We need to serve him.
[time=2010] No matter how much we've already done, as a matter of fact, if we've done a lot, he's taught us a lot through it, we have more to offer, the older we get, we ought to be serving more and leading these younger people, showing them how to do it.
[time=2026] I'm getting old enough to say this with some authority now, I like that.
[time=2030] I used to say that when I was 30, and everybody'd look and be like, who do you think you are?
[time=2034] I'm gonna do it 'til I breathe my last breath.
[time=2039] And then I bet you I get a chance to do it there too.
[time=2042] Sometimes people say number four, I'm not prepared, I don't have training.
[time=2050] That's an excuse sometimes.
[time=2053] I need more thorough training to get ready.
[time=2056] We're trying to offer some of those things around here.
[time=2058] Sign up, we have electives.
[time=2061] You can learn how to be.
[time=2062] Get alongside somebody who knows how to hammer something.
[time=2065] I took a little toy hammer in honor of Kelly yesterday.
[time=2070] Some of you were here when he described his first roofing job.
[time=2073] He kind of showed up with a little tack hammer.
[time=2074] They had a good time laughing at him on the job there.
[time=2077] We can help you get some training.
[time=2081] Start putting some time in with some people that minister, that do what acts of service, and you'll learn.
[time=2087] And fifthly, sometimes people say, I'm not mature enough to minister.
[time=2092] They're thinking about ministry as far as spiritual ministry to people.
[time=2096] And sometimes they say, I'm just not mature enough.
[time=2099] Well, here's what maturity is.
[time=2101] Maturity in Christianity is being in training, living and working with eternity in mind.
[time=2113] It's not about how much knowledge you've accumulated.
[time=2116] It's about being in the process of learning, being in training.
[time=2122] It's about being in the process of living it out, in the process of working in the workplace or at home.
[time=2132] Thinking about him and having eternity on your mind
[time=2138] when you do those things.
[time=2139] You can be that mature now, whoever you are.
[time=2143] You can be in process now.
[time=2147] And all God needs is a willing, available heart in process, hanging on to him, moving through life to use you as a servant.
[time=2157] He'll do it through you.
[time=2159] Don't feel worthy, don't have time.
[time=2165] Put in my time already.
[time=2166] I'm not prepared, no training.
[time=2169] I'm not spiritually mature.
[time=2171] We use those as excuses, but those aren't good, they're not real.
[time=2175] God says there's something else about you.
[time=2178] If you know him, first Peter, chapter two, verse nine is about you.
[time=2184] Let's look at it.
[time=2187] This is who you are.
[time=2189] You are a chosen people.
[time=2191] You didn't choose God, he chose you.
[time=2195] You are a chosen people.
[time=2198] He said, I'm going to, out of, among all the people I've created, I'm going to choose some.
[time=2205] If you know him, if you're in relationship with him, you're chosen by him.
[time=2210] You're a chosen people.
[time=2213] Look at this next part.
[time=2215] You're a royal priesthood.
[time=2218] Don't think less of yourself than you ought.
[time=2220] Romans 12 says you shouldn't think more highly of yourself than you ought, but you also shouldn't think more less of yourself than you ought.
[time=2229] You're a royal priesthood, the priesthood of believers.
[time=2234] You can do the role of the priest in your home with your neighbors and we're a royal priesthood.
[time=2242] We're a priest serving the king of kings, not just a king, the king of kings.
[time=2250] And we get a chance to be his priest, serving him as a priesthood.
[time=2256] We're a holy nation.
[time=2258] Not holy because I'm good.
[time=2259] Holy because I'm forgiven.
[time=2263] I had a mom call me one time from the school and she called and she said, I just have to tell you something.
[time=2269] She said, my daughter came home and every time you see her, you tell her she's not good.
[time=2275] In my first response, I didn't say it, but I wanted to say, well, of course she isn't.
[time=2281] She's your daughter.
[time=2282] She's not good.
[time=2284] Well, she wouldn't be if she's my daughter either.
[time=2286] Because I used to greet kids when they'd say, if you heard, I'd never heard this until, well, I don't know, 20 years ago or so, but you say, how are you or hello?
[time=2296] And people say I'm good.
[time=2298] The kids would respond, say, how are you?
[time=2300] I'm good.
[time=2302] I just always say, you're not good, but you might be forgiven.
[time=2304] I don't think she went home and told her mom that second part.
[time=2309] I just always said, you're not good, but you might be forgiven.
[time=2315] You're forgiven if you've really received the sacrifice that was made to make you a forgiven person, a holy nation, we're set apart by God as his chosen holy nation to be his ministers.
[time=2330] That's powerful.
[time=2333] Then it says, a people belonging to God.
[time=2338] Have you ever, you ought to think about it.
[time=2340] Now, maybe I need to get one of these earrings that you stick in there.
[time=2343] The bond servants used to put a pierced earring in their ear to signify that they were bound to, they chose to be the servant of.
[time=2353] They were bonded, a bond servant of Christ.
[time=2358] Maybe I ought to get something stuck in my ear.
[time=2364] I doubt it, but I belong to him.
[time=2368] I belong to him.
[time=2372] I really don't have anything outwardly that expresses the reality that I belong to him, but I know it.
[time=2378] I hope the expression of this, that outwardly, is a life lived out in front of people that would say, oh, he's a child of him, he's his.
[time=2388] He belongs to him, he's serving him.
[time=2392] I hope that's obvious to people.
[time=2394] You're a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God who's called you out of darkness.
[time=2403] Rejoice in it.
[time=2404] He's called us out of darkness.
[time=2406] We would be wallowing in that mess if he hadn't called us out of that darkness a long time ago.
[time=2410] We'd still be just groveling in the mess of darkness that appears to be light.
[time=2415] He's called us out of darkness into his marvelous life.
[time=2423] We get to sing the praises that he's chosen me so that I may declare the praises of him who's called me out of that.
[time=2430] And I do that with my voice, and I can do that as a minister, uniquely gifted to uniquely serve.
[time=2441] (coughing) You know what?
[time=2446] I don't know what was going on in everybody's heart yesterday.
[time=2450] When people were certain.
[time=2453] There may have been one of those 300 in the gym, might have been doing that so that one of you would see them serving.
[time=2459] I don't know what's going on there.
[time=2462] But I know who knows.
[time=2466] I don't have to judge that.
[time=2471] What I really need to be careful of is I deceive myself into being that person sometimes.
[time=2475] But I know who knows.
[time=2477] I know to whom I'm accountable.
[time=2479] And I can be real nervous about that, or I can rejoice in that.
[time=2485] That's who you are right there.
[time=2490] If you're a believer in Jesus Christ, you're a chosen people.
[time=2494] You're a royal priesthood.
[time=2495] You're a holy nation.
[time=2496] You're a people belonging to God, not because you deserve it, just because that's who you are by His grace.
[time=2502] Rejoice in that.
[time=2504] Enjoy that.
[time=2505] That's who you are.
[time=2506] Don't beat yourself up.
[time=2508] That's who you are.
[time=2509] Let's look at Ephesians 4.
[time=2514] 11 and 12.
[time=2517] What?
[time=2519] Me a minister?
[time=2520] Yeah.
[time=2521] This passage says so.
[time=2522] Ephesians chapter four says, "It was He who gave some to be apostles." Ephesians 4, 11.
[time=2528] Some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers.
[time=2533] Let's read verse 12.
[time=2534] "To prepare God's people for works of service
[time=2540] "so that the body of Christ may be built up." Let's go back and look at those words.
[time=2545] Ephesians chapter four verse 11.
[time=2547] It says, "He's called some to be apostles, "an apostle and an evangelist." I mean, and a prophet are two offices that were held by people chosen by God, and they were the earlier in Ephesians 4.
[time=2563] It says they were the foundation of the church, the prophets and the apostles.
[time=2568] The prophets, all those people who prophesied for God, two people about God and the apostles.
[time=2578] Those chosen by God to be the disciples of Jesus Christ,
[time=2584] the 12, and then Matthias taking Judas's place.
[time=2589] And then Paul, who was confronted on the road to Damascus by Jesus himself, the risen Lord, and he was told he's gonna be an apostle.
[time=2597] He'll represent God to the Gentiles.
[time=2600] Those are the apostles.
[time=2601] They did miracles to establish the church.
[time=2605] He called some to be apostles and some to be prophets,
[time=2611] some to be evangelists.
[time=2612] And evangelists is one who preaches, I'll get this, preaches and explains the good news of salvation.
[time=2624] And evangelists is consumed with reaching people who don't know Christ.
[time=2630] And there's an office in the church for an evangelist.
[time=2635] It says so here.
[time=2638] Billy Graham is a pretty good one.
[time=2643] Billy Graham knew that his calling, his calling wasn't to be in a seminary to expose the Christ's scriptures or to be in a church setting like this, a local body to expose the, his calling by God was to be an evangelist to preach and explain the good news of Jesus Christ
[time=2662] so that people who didn't know him could understand who he was and receive the gift of salvation.
[time=2669] And he did that really well.
[time=2670] And there have been a lot of them.
[time=2672] Dial Moody was a great evangelist.
[time=2674] Whitefield was a great evangelist.
[time=2677] Jonathan Edwards was a tremendous evangelist.
[time=2680] God has raised up evangelists as an office in the body.
[time=2685] Some people have the gift of evangelism.
[time=2689] It's a spiritual gift.
[time=2691] Others of us who don't necessarily have that gift, we're not compelled to do that as much as the person with that gift is.
[time=2698] We are called to do that on a regular basis because the great commission is to all of us.
[time=2703] We're to go preach the gospel, tell the truth.
[time=2705] We just aren't compelled like they are.
[time=2707] Evangelists is one who preaches and explains the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ for salvation to the lost.
[time=2717] And then there's the pastor and teacher it says.
[time=2720] And some be pastors and teachers.
[time=2723] In this particular passage, it's not really clear that this is one office.
[time=2728] A couple other places in the New Testament, this is a joint office.
[time=2732] It's one person holding this pastor and teacher function.
[time=2735] But here it's not real clear about that.
[time=2737] And some people I believe have pastoral gifts.
[time=2741] They're shepherds that office in the church for shepherding.
[time=2746] Keith, you weren't in here first service.
[time=2748] I talked about you then.
[time=2749] I'll do it again now even though you're in here.
[time=2751] Here's a man that has a shepherd's heart.
[time=2755] He's got a pastoral gift.
[time=2757] He's used it for years.
[time=2758] How old are you Keith?
[time=2760] 82, have you breathed your last breath yet?
[time=2764] Okay.
[time=2766] He's got the pastoral shepherding gift.
[time=2770] When he visits people in the hospital, they feel like they've been cared for because he cares for them.
[time=2777] Kelly's like that too.
[time=2783] Kelly's got a pastoral heart.
[time=2785] I'm not so good at that.
[time=2788] I kind of want to just tell people to buck up, straighten up, get up, get to work.
[time=2791] I'm not real good at that.
[time=2795] I'm better about just teaching.
[time=2796] I love the passages about obedience.
[time=2798] I have to be careful about that.
[time=2801] Sometimes the most encouraging passages people walk up thinking I beat them up.
[time=2807] Teacher, two.
[time=2812] One who preaches and explains the word of God.
[time=2818] That teacher function is real important in the body of Christ.
[time=2821] People that are teachers, they teach and explain the word of God.
[time=2827] We need to be careful to move through the whole council of the word of God as teachers and teach the whole council of God not just selected passages that we enjoy.
[time=2838] We need to expose what God has revealed to us and that's what expositional preaching is.
[time=2844] It's exposing what's revealed here rather than just what's on my own heart.
[time=2850] We need to move through the scriptures.
[time=2853] Exposing God's revelation to the people that we teach.
[time=2857] It was he who gave some to be apostles,
[time=2864] some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers.
[time=2867] Some of you probably are in that office.
[time=2869] Keith is in that office.
[time=2871] Let's go on with the rest of that passage.
[time=2873] Verse 12, to prepare God's people.
[time=2875] Well, who's that in here?
[time=2877] The saints to prepare God's people.
[time=2882] The saints, that's all of us for works of service.
[time=2887] To prepare God's people, the saints for works of service
[time=2894] so that the body of Christ may be built up.
[time=2901] We need to equip the offices of the church.
[time=2909] God's people, the saints with equipment
[time=2915] to do the ministry that God needs done.
[time=2919] Man, oh man, no wonder the guy in our town couldn't get it all done.
[time=2925] How could he minister to all of our town by himself?
[time=2930] Our whole church should have been out there doing the ministry in our town instead of sending him out because he's the guy we gave money to.
[time=2938] Do you understand that you're one of God's people
[time=2949] and that you're equipped.
[time=2952] You're to be prepared for works of service so that the body may be built up, so that the whole body gets to be built up.
[time=2959] When all the body serves, do you know how effective that is?
[time=2964] If we were out there, just think about it.
[time=2968] If all of us in this room were doing ministry all week this week, every day at work, every night at home, Saturday in the neighborhood,
[time=2982] we were really doing ministry.
[time=2984] We were really building up the body.
[time=2985] Would that be incredible or what?
[time=2987] How effective would that be?
[time=2990] Well, here's a point to take home and ponder.
[time=2995] You're each uniquely gifted.
[time=3004] The body of Christ to be complete, all of us doing our part.
[time=3009] You're uniquely gifted to serve in the body
[time=3015] and be light outside the body.
[time=3018] Your unique gifts will show up as light when you do them as unto the Lord.
[time=3022] You don't have to get real creative about exposing light.
[time=3026] You'll be light.
[time=3027] You don't have to get real creative about a light bulb
[time=3033] functioning as a light bulb.
[time=3034] If it's hanging in your garage, it'll do just fine.
[time=3039] You turn it on, just turn it on.
[time=3042] Just turn on your consciousness about being a minister this week.
[time=3049] And the light of Christ will be exposed out there and at home.
[time=3054] And you need to do it here as well.
[time=3058] Each uniquely gifted, each uniquely needed, we need you
[time=3069] as part of the body to serve.
[time=3073] Well, I see you out there, folks.
[time=3075] I see you out there.
[time=3077] I see you out there around town.
[time=3079] I see Milt Lonegger in servants' hands doing projects once a month or twice a month to help people who really have needs.
[time=3090] The men in our church are good about doing that.
[time=3092] I see him.
[time=3093] I see Audrey Handel.
[time=3097] She doesn't do her job here like a job.
[time=3101] She cleans spots off windows that everybody else would just let.
[time=3106] She does things with people who have deaths in their family that nobody knows about.
[time=3110] I see her.
[time=3113] I see Gary Cooper at Masterworks Foundation putting people together, networking people so that they'll build the kingdom together in all kinds of ways.
[time=3121] I see John and Liz Nussbaum in their neighborhood patiently waiting for their neighbors to come to Christ 'cause they love them.
[time=3131] They love their neighbors.
[time=3134] I see Doug and Carol Ford at Touch Plate thinking about that business, that for-profit business, as a kingdom-building enterprise, doing God's business, God's way, in a for-profit business.
[time=3145] I see them doing that.
[time=3147] They talk about that.
[time=3149] How are we gonna use the money?
[time=3151] How are we gonna treat our customers?
[time=3152] How are we gonna treat our employees?
[time=3156] I see you guys doing that.
[time=3157] A lot of you are doing it.
[time=3158] I rejoice in that.
[time=3160] I just wanna challenge all of you to realize this.
[time=3164] We can all do it.
[time=3165] We're all called to be ministers.
[time=3171] Me a minister?
[time=3172] Yes.
[time=3174] You.
[time=3175] Our Father in Heaven.
[time=3178] I bow down before you.
[time=3180] And I tell you that I love you.
[time=3184] I love the opportunity to be up here.
[time=3186] And I pray that you will be glorified in our ministry this week.
[time=3191] I pray that the body will be built up, that the lost will be reached, and that will be a suite of aroma in your nostrils as we serve you as ministers of the gospel.
[time=3204] Please help us in Jesus' name I pray.
[time=3207] [AMEN]
[time=3218] [MUSIC - 222 seconds]
[time=3443] Hebrews 4, it says,
[time=3455] "Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight.
[time=3470] Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of Him to whom we must give an account.
[time=3479] That's not a threat.
[time=3483] For people who are serving, it's a rejoicing passage saying, "Oh yeah, he knows."
[time=3495] He knows what's going on in your heart when you do it.
[time=3500] You're laid bare before Him.
[time=3504] We're all exposed before Him.
[time=3506] He sees and it's not a threat.
[time=3511] Accountability is a promise to those who believe.
[time=3516] We look forward to it.
[time=3520] How you feeling in your heart?
[time=3527] You are uniquely gifted and you're very uniquely needed.
[time=3531] Please serve Him here and there.
[time=3557] (Silence)
