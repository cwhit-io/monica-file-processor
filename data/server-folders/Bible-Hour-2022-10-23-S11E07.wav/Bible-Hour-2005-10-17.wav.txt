[time=27] >>And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=50] and on earth, therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name
[time=61] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=72] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=78] the end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=89] >>Well, hello again to all of you who are tuning in, we're so thankful for the opportunity
[time=100] to share this time with you so thankful for this broadcast and the encouragement that we
[time=106] know it brings to so many.
[time=108] It is a privilege to partner with you in this and we're so thankful for the relationship that God continues to give us here at Blackhawk with those of you in the viewing audience.
[time=118] I'm just recently back from a nine-day trip to Russia.
[time=123] What an amazing time me and those from our team, several of us went, and we were able to encourage the church over there in the Yvonnevo region, a region that we have along
[time=135] with a few other churches here in the Fort Wayne area, partnered with to come alongside those folks and encourage them and teach them, and you know how it always is, you go to encourage and teach and come alongside and they end up encouraging and teaching you.
[time=150] We had a phenomenal trip, and I'm so thankful for the relationship that God is building with
[time=156] the church in Russia and those of us here in this area in Fort Wayne, but really thankful to be back, really thankful to be here at home and able to continue in what God has us doing here.
[time=167] I want to say to you that our website has some things on it that I think you'd be interested in.
[time=173] I want to draw your attention to blackhawkministries.org.
[time=176] If you go to the website, first of all, you can click on the Katrina icon, and when you do that, we've talked about this before, you can go to a sheet that allows you to fill out a volunteer form.
[time=187] If you're interested in being a part of an ongoing effort between blackhawk and several other local churches here in Fort Wayne, there's medical teams that you can be a part of and
[time=198] there are clean up teams that you can be a part of.
[time=201] All you have to do is indicate which one as you make your way through the volunteer signup.
[time=206] Click on the Katrina icon, let us know of your willingness, and we would really appreciate your help.
[time=212] Many people down there are continuing to try to rebuild their lives, and we're thankful for the opportunity God's given us to, in some small, but I think significant ways, contribute to that effort.
[time=223] Also, as you make your way down that homepage on our website, you'll notice down at the
[time=229] bottom on the left-hand side, you can click on to our new worship album.
[time=234] Blackhawk has over the years, I know, been a source of encouragement for many of you.
[time=240] You mention it often when you write us and when I bump into you out in the community, you always talk about how much our music and our worship, the instrumental and vocal talent
[time=252] God has given this place.
[time=253] I know it has been a real encouragement to many of you.
[time=256] Well, we have finally captured that, to a degree at least, on a worship CD that has just
[time=262] been released.
[time=263] I think you can download one of the songs on an MP3, but I want to let you know that not only can you download a song on an MP3, you can get the CD itself just by coming on a
[time=274] Sunday morning, they are available in the four-year.
[time=277] We would love to put one in your hands and we're so thankful for what God allows our musicians and vocalists to be a part of as they lead us in worship and as they encourage so many.
[time=288] Hey, the message you're going to hear today is a message from this past week about spiritual gifts, spiritual gifts.
[time=295] You know, it's an amazing thing when you come to know the Lord, when you enter into that
[time=301] life-saving, eternity-altering relationship with Him, when He redeems us, the Bible says
[time=307] that He gives us gifts.
[time=309] He gives us divine spiritual enablements that allow us to minister and serve and make a
[time=316] difference for all of eternity, especially in the church.
[time=320] And so as you watch and as you listen today, I hope that you'll keep your heart and mind open.
[time=325] Many of you may know about your gifts.
[time=327] Many of you may have a very clear understanding of how He has uniquely gifted you to make
[time=333] a contribution to the life of the body of Christ.
[time=336] Others of you may know Him, but maybe to this point in your relationship with Him, you've
[time=342] never discovered that special gift or gifts that He's given you.
[time=346] Gifts that you need to not only know what they are, but you need to exercise them.
[time=351] You need to use those gifts because when you use your gift and I use my gift and they're using their gifts when the body of Christ's willing to use their gifts, He does amazing
[time=362] things.
[time=363] The church is equipped, the church is grown, the church is strengthened when everybody does what God designed you to do.
[time=370] So listen, be encouraged as we continue in this series called A Life Beyond Me, Discovering
[time=377] the Life-Changing Value of Serving.
[time=380] God bless you.
[time=381] Thanks so much for tuning in and we hope to see you soon.
[time=385] Is this the place to sign up to volunteer?
[time=387] Yes, it is.
[time=388] Good.
[time=389] But we don't open for another six minutes.
[time=391] Oh, sorry.
[time=392] And could you wait behind the line, please?
[time=395] Right.

[time=405] Is this a place...
[time=412] Is this a place to volunteer?
[time=413] Yes, it is.
[time=415] We put those idle little hands in a needy, needy place to build a great, big heart with a happy, happy faith.
[time=424] Is this the place to...
[time=427] Are you the person to talk to about, you know?
[time=431] I'm sorry.
[time=433] You know, talk to about, begins with an S. It's really painful.
[time=439] Does it think church people try to avoid at all costs?
[time=443] Sin?
[time=444] Yes.
[time=445] Serving.
[time=446] Oh.
[time=447] Is... is this place to volunteer?
[time=452] Sure is.

[time=511] Blue BMW, with a license plate that reads "Hot One B-A-B".
[time=519] Perspective member of the church for 37 months.
[time=522] You think that moosing your hair on Sunday mornings is an adequate replacement for a shower.
[time=527] And just the little clue from me to you, you might want to try contacting your mother more than once every six months.
[time=533] The man upstairs is not pleased.
[time=535] The birdman?
[time=536] No.
[time=537] The man way upstairs?
[time=539] Oh, yes.
[time=544] M.C.
[time=545] Farland.
[time=546] Number?
[time=548] 555-1212.
[time=549] 1212.
[time=550] I have no idea what ministry to get involved with.
[time=554] Oh, well, we can help you with that.
[time=556] I just, I never thought I'd be doing this in a million years.
[time=559] Look, if you are not ready, you can always come back when we don't want to rush anyone.
[time=564] I think I'm ready?
[time=566] Hmm.
[time=567] How long have you been coming to the church?
[time=569] Oh, it's been about 28 years, 17 minutes, a little over three years.
[time=576] Okay.
[time=577] And can I just try it out to see if I'm any good at it?
[time=579] Oh, absolutely.
[time=580] That's what first serves all about.
[time=583] Yeah.
[time=584] Great idea.
[time=585] No commitment.
[time=586] All right, try it out.
[time=587] And if I don't like it, sayonara.
[time=589] Yep.
[time=590] Yeah.
[time=591] It's like ministry prenup.
[time=592] I should have had one of those with my wife.
[time=596] It's really great that you're willing to give this a try.
[time=598] So what are you interested in?
[time=600] Medieval torture devices fascinate me.
[time=603] So what are you interested in?
[time=606] Cinnamon crunch bagels.
[time=609] So what ministries are you interested in?
[time=612] What are my options?
[time=613] Let's see.
[time=614] We need help with hospital visitation.
[time=616] I knew it.
[time=618] Fine.
[time=619] It was a handicap spot, but it was just 10 minutes.
[time=621] Isn't this a little extreme?
[time=625] Hospital visitations, men's ministries.
[time=628] Oh, do you have anything in the single young adult female 20-something ministry?
[time=635] Men's ministries, traffic team.
[time=638] Traffic team.
[time=639] I could probably do traffic team.
[time=640] Oh, good.
[time=641] Yeah, I kind of like being outdoors.
[time=642] Well, we could sure use your help out there.
[time=643] You can't seem to keep enough of those traffic guys around.
[time=645] Why is that?
[time=646] Oh, it's all the escalates in the lot.
[time=648] They just seem to eat up those bright orange jackets for breakfast.
[time=656] Do you have anything where I could work with my hands?
[time=659] Can you do carpentry?
[time=660] That's one of my hobbies.
[time=661] How's Thursday night sound?
[time=662] Are you asking me out?
[time=667] That's the night of my bail hearing.
[time=669] And Mr. Viver, Thursday nights really don't work for me.
[time=674] I'll be coming back from Indy that night.
[time=676] Oh, well, that's OK.
[time=677] We want this to be a good fit for you.
[time=679] Let's see what else we have.
[time=681] Oh, and anything that doesn't involve-- this is embarrassing.
[time=686] No, no, it's OK.
[time=688] We all have our sensitive spots.
[time=690] It's just that-- I'm sorry.
[time=692] I'm not sure if I'm ready to-- You don't want to work with someone.
[time=695] We understand who is it.
[time=696] No.
[time=697] The opposite sense?
[time=698] No, and it's definitely not that.
[time=699] The homeless?
[time=700] No, there's nothing wrong with them, just me.
[time=703] The incarcerated.
[time=705] Is there any way that I could avoid working with?
[time=708] Yes.
[time=710] Church people?
[time=711] Well, what a great look into the mind and thinking of many,
[time=721] I would suspect, at different times in your journey serving.
[time=725] And all that comes with it.
[time=728] Well, dobe-utra.
[time=730] That's all I know.
[time=735] So you just-- you got all my Russian in one word there.
[time=738] Dobe-utra means good morning.
[time=740] I think it means good morning.
[time=741] I kind of took it to mean let's eat, but either way, it was a-- it was one of the things they said early on in the day.
[time=749] Wow, it's good to see all of you.
[time=751] As many of you know, some of you may not know, but we just got back last night, myself and Brent Imer, who is our global ministries pastor, Jason Maley, who's one of our elders, and Andrew Maley, Jason's brother, and part of this family for a long, long time, and a good friend.
[time=768] We all got back last night from Russia, where we were for the last nine days.
[time=773] And what an amazing trip.
[time=776] We'll tell you more about it in the days to come, so many things, to communicate with you and catch you up on.
[time=780] But I just want to tell you, we are so very, very thankful that we went.
[time=785] So glad to be home, but so thankful for what we were able to experience, the people, that we were able to meet.
[time=792] It is an amazing, amazing place with some of the most precious people that you would ever, ever want to meet.
[time=800] And I am better.
[time=802] I got-- God did a work in me.
[time=806] God-- God grew my heart, and God expanded my mind.
[time=809] And God showed me some things that I will be forever grateful for.
[time=815] And I just want to thank you for your prayers.
[time=817] I know, Kebra, thanks you, the wives, and the families of us guys that went.
[time=821] Thank you.
[time=822] They all felt prayed for, and your kindness and that respect was much, much appreciated.
[time=828] I want you to know that I had the privilege this last week to teach.
[time=835] Most of you know that what I went to do was, as part of our coalition, North Park Community Church, Blackhawk, Wallen Baptist, and Miriam Chapel, out in Cher busco.
[time=845] The four of our churches have come together as a unit, really minister, reach out to, equip, and encourage these churches in the region of Ivanovo and Vladimir.
[time=857] There are about 25 to 30 churches that have been started.
[time=860] These churches are led by a man named Vladimir.
[time=865] And Vladimir and Sergey are the pastors at the Central Church there in Ivanovo.
[time=868] And these two men are giving leadership to this team of men who are out there trying their very best in a very, very rough place, in a very, very complicated world
[time=880] there.
[time=881] They're trying their very best to teach God's word and to be the church.
[time=886] And it was an amazing thing to see.
[time=888] I want you to know that of the 20 men that I spent a week with, these men are now-- it's like an irreversible deal.
[time=896] They're just-- they're in my heart now.
[time=898] I see their faces.
[time=900] And I grew to know their stories and them as men.
[time=903] And I am so grateful for them.
[time=905] They humbled.
[time=909] They reminded me of what this is about.
[time=913] And I want you to know that of these 20 men or so that I was with all week, we would teach from nine in the morning.
[time=918] I would teach from nine in the morning till five at night.
[time=922] And I would take breaks.
[time=925] And they would take them, I think, more obligatory than anything else.
[time=929] They just wanted to hear more teaching.
[time=932] They wanted to ask more questions.
[time=934] They wanted to be encouraged.
[time=936] They wanted to be together.
[time=937] They wanted to spend time with me.
[time=939] And so we would do that every day.
[time=940] And of this group of 20, 25 or so, I just want-- just for some perspective, I want you to realize that one of them was a pretty decent range.
[time=950] One of them pastors at church of three.
[time=952] And one of them pastors at church of 300.
[time=959] And it's all in between there.
[time=963] The wealthiest of the 20 makes $300 a month.
[time=968] Has a wife and four kids.
[time=972] And half of them don't get paid anything in terms of support.
[time=976] They just work.
[time=977] They have jobs, and they just do their best to make ends meet and pastor a church.
[time=982] And they all took time off from their jobs to come for a week.
[time=986] They all wore the same shirts and the same pants
[time=995] and the same ties and the same jackets.
[time=999] I got them to back off on that two or three days in.
[time=1002] I got them to loosen up their ties a little bit.
[time=1004] But I was a little worried.
[time=1006] I was telling the guys.
[time=1007] I was a little worried by Friday.
[time=1009] I caught myself in the hotel room thinking, man, I'm going to have to wear a sweatsuit because all of my shirts were dirty.
[time=1020] Because I had worn them one day.
[time=1024] And I almost said to the men, I'm so thankful.
[time=1026] The spirit of God, I think, just shut my mouth.
[time=1028] But I almost said to them, I'm sorry.
[time=1030] I'm so casual this morning.
[time=1031] All my shirts were dirty.
[time=1034] And I didn't say that.
[time=1035] I'm so thankful.
[time=1035] I didn't.
[time=1036] They're just a really, really precious, precious people.
[time=1041] And they are so grateful for you.
[time=1043] They are so thankful for Black Hawk.
[time=1045] They're so looking forward to the days ahead.
[time=1048] We will continue to take trips.
[time=1050] We'll take medical people.
[time=1051] We'll take folks to work in the orphanage.
[time=1053] We'll take young people.
[time=1054] We'll take musicians.
[time=1055] We'll just continue to invest.
[time=1057] And I just want you to know it's a really-- it's a good thing.
[time=1060] Hey, we left, just so you know, I might fall asleep midway through the message this morning.
[time=1065] I don't really know what day it is.
[time=1067] I'm not sure what time it is.
[time=1069] I'm a little foggy, if that makes any sense.
[time=1072] We left-- from the time we left our hotel to come home to when we got home last night, it had been 43 hours.
[time=1079] And that included the last day of ministry.
[time=1082] And then a eight-hour train ride and a 12-hour plane ride and a stay over in Atlanta.
[time=1087] So anyway, it's just great to be home.
[time=1089] And it's so good to see you.
[time=1090] And I'm so thankful for what we got to experience.
[time=1092] And like I said, more to come.
[time=1094] Open your Bibles, if you would, this morning.
[time=1098] The first Corinthians chapter 12.
[time=1100] We will get there in just a moment.
[time=1101] That is where we will begin.
[time=1102] But before we get to the text this morning, I want to just give you a brief recap of where we've been.
[time=1107] Let's do that, shall we?
[time=1108] This is the fifth week in a six-week series that we have entitled A Life Beyond Me.
[time=1115] A Life Beyond Me, discovering the life-changing value of serving, serving, giving ourselves to others.
[time=1122] We began week one, for those of you who weren't here, many of you have been here each week.
[time=1126] But let me just give you a brief recap for those who are catching up.
[time=1130] Week one, we talked about some concerns.
[time=1132] And the concerns basically boiled down came to this.
[time=1135] We have in many cases, at many times, we have become as a church about, remember the three props?
[time=1142] We want to win the debate.
[time=1144] We always want to be right.
[time=1145] We become critical and analytical to an extreme ad nauseum.
[time=1149] We wave our red flags and begin to be known for what we're against.
[time=1154] And then we had the shopping cart.
[time=1155] We've also, at times, become a people who are more about what we get from church, filling up our carts than we are about being a people who are consumed with giving, emptying the cart into the lives of others.
[time=1169] That was the week that we talked about.
[time=1170] Steve and Mitch and I, we talked about shrinking our agendas.
[time=1174] Philippians chapter two was our text.
[time=1176] And we talked about shrinking, doing away with our agendas, doing away with our demands, being a people who would entrust those things to God and then be freed up to give ourselves, all of ourselves to others.
[time=1191] We talked about shrinking and thinking, taking on the mind of Christ who didn't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped, it said in Philippians two, but he emptied himself so that he could be the ultimate servant.
[time=1206] That was week one, this mindset, this shift that has to take place, that moves us toward others instead of ourselves.
[time=1213] Week two was Romans 12.1.
[time=1215] It talked about the transformation of a servant moving from being selfish to selfless.
[time=1221] And how do we do that?
[time=1222] How do we, by God's grace, make this transition from the selfish to the selfless?
[time=1228] Well, we looked at Romans 12.1 and we were reminded there that by the mercy of God it said in view of God's mercy.
[time=1235] Remember, when you and I stop long enough to consider where we've been, when we stop long enough to consider what he has saved us from, when we stop long enough to consider the great mercy and grace of God that saw us in all of our sinfulness, in all of our fallenness, and he saved us.
[time=1254] He sent his son and he gave us life and hope and in view of God's mercy.
[time=1259] Remember Jake, my son, and the illustration of the discipline and how in view of God's mercy, the father's grace, our hearts are full of gratitude and willingness to do anything that he would ask, to go anywhere that he would lead, to offer ourselves in any form or fashion.
[time=1278] And it's the being in view of, it's the vision of, it's the realization of his mercy that moves us to selfless living.
[time=1288] And in that passage, we saw that we're to offer our bodies, all of us, our minds, our feet, our hands, our eyes, our mouths, and when all of that is dedicated to him, the text said, we serve and we accomplish his perfect will.
[time=1303] Week three, week three, we looked at serving and the ordinary everyday opportunities.
[time=1310] We looked at that woman at the well that Jesus came across and we learned that with serving, sometimes it's not in a, sometimes it's not in a program.
[time=1319] Sometimes the serving that God allows us to do isn't in a program, it's more about people and it's more about the opportunities.
[time=1326] Remember the opportunities that he brings across your path and they can come at any time, they can come at any moment, they can come at any place.
[time=1333] We learned that sometimes it's a room with kids or teaching a class of adults, but sometimes it just crosses your daily path, like the leper.
[time=1344] We looked at in Matthew eight, remember the leper?
[time=1347] Remember that story we looked at?
[time=1348] Mitch and I were teaching that morning and we came across this leper in Matthew eight who in essence said to Jesus, I know you're busy.
[time=1357] He had just preached the sermon on the mount, remember?
[time=1361] He's coming off the hill.
[time=1363] Had spent hours teaching thousands of people.
[time=1365] He says, in essence the leper says, I know you're busy.
[time=1368] I know you got a lot going on.
[time=1369] I know you're probably on your way to the next healing or hillside sermon.
[time=1373] I realized that you've put in your time, but do you think that you could stop long enough to touch me?
[time=1381] I'm a leper and I know it may not be the most attractive ministry option.
[time=1390] I know it might not be your thing.
[time=1392] It's funny, I hear that phrase sometimes in conversations with people about serving.
[time=1401] Some people actually say that, I'd like to help, but it's whatever it is we're talking about.
[time=1407] It's really not my thing, they say, interesting.
[time=1412] The leper in essence says to Jesus,
[time=1418] could you press pause long enough to extend the hand?
[time=1423] And as we taught through that passage, we realized that in a powerful way, Jesus did more than pause in extend the hand.
[time=1429] He healed the leper.
[time=1431] He took this ordinary everyday opportunity that just crossed his path and he was willing to stop what he was doing and give.
[time=1438] And we learned that the way Mitchell said it that morning is God takes everyday opportunities and turns them into extraordinary outcomes.
[time=1447] I want to thank many of you who were involved in that very endeavor this past Saturday.
[time=1452] It was so encouraging to be in Russia and hear about the big serve.
[time=1455] Over 300 of you came that day.
[time=1456] You were willing to give three hours.
[time=1459] And I'm thankful for those of you who were willing to give three hours to come and help meet everyday ordinary needs in the lives of everyday people.
[time=1467] I got up this morning somehow early enough to kind of stumble into the living room and watch the Bible hour at the beginning of which was the video the team had put together of that day and had absolutely just thrilled my heart to see young and old alike banding together to help serve in such basic but meaningful ways.
[time=1485] And we will do that very thing again and again and again.
[time=1488] When you do that, when I give myself to that, he does extraordinary stuff.
[time=1492] And then Steve came last week and talked about how every one of us is a minister.
[time=1497] That's right.
[time=1498] Everybody that knows the Lord.
[time=1499] Everybody who's in the family of God.
[time=1501] Everybody who has fully surrendered their heart and life to him.
[time=1503] Everybody.
[time=1505] You got your little business card.
[time=1506] You're a minister.
[time=1509] And you think sometimes that's just me.
[time=1512] You think sometimes that's just guys who get a check.
[time=1514] But no, by God's design and we'll see it even more so today.
[time=1517] By God's design, you.
[time=1520] You are a minister.
[time=1521] You are an ambassador.
[time=1522] You are an official representative of God called to do ministry in the everyday of your life inside and outside these four walls.
[time=1534] And so that's where we've been.
[time=1536] And today we come to this arena, this discussion again of serving.
[time=1541] And we ask, and I'll start us this morning by asking it a very important question.
[time=1546] Please think this one through.
[time=1549] It's a doctrinal question.
[time=1550] Yes, it's also a very, very practical question.
[time=1553] What is it specifically?
[time=1555] Here you go.
[time=1556] What is it specifically that allows our serving efforts to be spiritually effective?
[time=1563] The spiritual serving efforts that you and I would engage in.
[time=1568] What is it about those efforts?
[time=1572] What is it about that activity?
[time=1574] What is it about a serving effort that allows it to be spiritually effective?
[time=1580] What allows your service and mind to be unique?
[time=1583] Watch this, not just unique, but even transformational?
[time=1587] Think about that.
[time=1590] I mean, I think about it sometimes.
[time=1592] I stand here and I do my best to teach God's word on a weekly basis.
[time=1599] Me, me, me, me with all of my faults,
[time=1605] with all of my issues, with all the things about me that aren't as they should be, yet, me with all of the sin in my life, with all of the things I've still got to get better at.
[time=1620] Me, trying to teach, and I do it.
[time=1625] And then the next week I get an email and somebody's eternity.
[time=1636] God altered.
[time=1636] God took that effort and He transformed a human life.
[time=1642] Are you kidding me?
[time=1644] How?
[time=1646] How does that happen?
[time=1647] Or you?
[time=1649] I won't just put me out there.
[time=1651] I'll go ahead and include you, you and all your issues, you and all your faults, you and all of your weaknesses, all the stuff about you that isn't quite yet as it should be, but he's working on you, but still you and you lead a small group, or you help teach some kids, or you go and help do odd jobs for the homeless, you doing whatever you do, and he takes what you do, and then two weeks later we hear that he took that, and he spiritually did something through it that changed somebody, forever.
[time=1684] How in the world does that happen?
[time=1690] Greeders, greet at the door, people at the guest center point folks toward bagels, cameramen shoot tape and it gets edited in a room by gifted technicians and God uses it all and we hear about it.
[time=1704] Lives changed forever.
[time=1707] How?
[time=1708] How does this take place?
[time=1711] How are these endeavors done by normal people like you and me?
[time=1715] How do they lead the lives being touched and spiritually transformed?
[time=1718] The answer, it certainly isn't about us.
[time=1722] Amen?
[time=1724] The answer has nothing to do, really.
[time=1727] At its most fundamental level, the answer has nothing to do with you or me, our talent, our ability, no.
[time=1736] In God's unique design to build up his church, listen, in God's design to reach out, lovingly embrace and transform the human heart, he doesn't rely on human talent, he instead infuses.
[time=1749] Now this gets a little mind boggling, but it's really true and this is exactly what he does.
[time=1754] He infuses, he transports, he gives at the point of salvation,
[time=1760] whenever you or I came to that place of faith in Christ where we fully surrendered our hearts and lives to him.
[time=1766] The Bible says that he at that moment, he infuses, he injects into your spiritual DNA, gifts, spiritual,
[time=1777] gifts, and he gives you these gifts.
[time=1781] And he gives you these gifts, these gifts are uniquely designed to be used in a uniquely powerful way.
[time=1791] These gifts have been given with a divine purpose as well, my friends, don't miss this.
[time=1796] Not only have they been uniquely designed for you to be given so that you can exercise them and use them, but it's not just kind of meaningless exercising and using them, no, there's a very specific purpose.
[time=1810] He gave you and I the gifts to build up, to strengthen, to encourage, to further the church, not the building, but the people.
[time=1823] It was amazing being in Russia.
[time=1824] Our kids this summer told us about it, but we saw it with our own eyes again.
[time=1829] They would feed us meals over in the house of prayer.
[time=1831] We would gather in the morning for early meetings in the house of prayer.
[time=1835] On Sundays, the body came together for worship in the house of prayer.
[time=1839] They didn't call the building the church.
[time=1842] The brick and mortar aren't the church.
[time=1844] And if ever there were a people having experienced all the persecution that they've experienced, having seen all that they've seen, having endured all that they've endured, they above everyone else knows that the church is them.
[time=1859] Followers of Christ, we are the church, the body of Christ.
[time=1864] And we happen to assemble.
[time=1866] We happen to gather in a building.
[time=1868] We're thankful for it, but that's the truth.
[time=1871] We're the church and these gifts we're given to build the church.
[time=1875] Now this is where it all starts to come together.
[time=1877] Watch this, the Scriptures teach that not only have we been given specific and unique gifts, divinely designed by God for us individually, but these gifts have been given so that we can all use them collectively together to accomplish great things.
[time=1891] 1 Corinthians 12, verse 4.
[time=1894] 1 Corinthians 12.
[time=1897] Verse 4.
[time=1898] And in honor of God's word, would you stand with me this morning?
[time=1904] It was so amazing to watch these people in Russia, these fellow believers, so amazing to watch them in the reverence and the respect that they had for the Scriptures, for the house of prayer, for prayer itself.
[time=1917] I want you to know that these dear people, many of them old and decrepit, I mean literally bodies failing from 80, 90-year-old women in scarves to the young kids that would come into the room.
[time=1932] They stood, I noticed this about them.
[time=1935] They stood a lot because they see that as a way of respecting.
[time=1939] We would gather for devotions in the morning, the men and I.
[time=1942] One of the brothers would lead a devotion and then we would pray.
[time=1945] We would go from 9 to 10.
[time=1947] And I just want you to know the devotion would last about 5 or 10 minutes.
[time=1952] And you and I come into this place and we stand and we sing and we sometimes get three or four songs in and start wondering, well, when are we going to sit down?
[time=1963] You know, they stood respectfully and they stood lovingly.
[time=1969] And they would pray for 40, 50 minutes.
[time=1972] I was dying.
[time=1974] I was trying to figure out ways to lean and I'm trying to figure out ways to ease my back.
[time=1979] And I'm just looking at these guys and they're not thinking about their backs.
[time=1984] They were so given to what they were doing.
[time=1987] Standing and showing respect.
[time=1989] It says in 1 Corinthians 12, 4, now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit.
[time=1995] Regarding spiritual gifts, he says back in verse 1, now concerning spiritual gifts, I do not want you to be unaware.
[time=2002] There are verse 4, there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit and there are varieties of ministries and the same Lord.
[time=2009] There are varieties of effects but the same God who works all things in all persons.
[time=2015] But to each one, stop there.
[time=2018] Everybody, look, look up here.
[time=2021] Serving.
[time=2022] In this game, in this arena, in this endeavor of serving.
[time=2026] I've come to the conclusion.
[time=2028] I used to kind of use the sports analogy and I would always talk about how I would love for you to get in the game.
[time=2034] Let me just say it to you this way.
[time=2035] I'm coming to the realization that in the serving arena, biblically speaking, there is no sideline.
[time=2043] There just isn't.
[time=2045] There's no bench.
[time=2047] There's no time out.
[time=2050] We're just, we're in it, my friends.
[time=2052] And each one of you, it says, verse 7, you see it there?
[time=2057] "But to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit."
[time=2063] For the what?
[time=2064] Say it.
[time=2066] You use yours and I use mine.
[time=2069] And when we're all using our gifts collectively and together to serve the body and to make much of God, to bring great glory to him, he does amazing, amazing things.
[time=2081] Father God, we pray that we would be a people today and in the days to come that would use our gifts, God, that we would exercise what you have divinely instilled in us, God that we wouldn't be afraid, but that we would be courageous, that we wouldn't be lazy, God that we would be diligent, God that we would be a people ready in our hearts to go where we need to go and do what we need to do, God to serve in whatever form or fashion you would call us to by the design, God, that you've placed in us.
[time=2112] Thank you for these gifts and may we understand them better in the days to come.
[time=2115] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=2118] You can be seated.
[time=2119] So we see the Word of God.
[time=2121] Listen, we see the Word of God teaching that the people of God are transformed by gifts, gifts given by the Spirit of God
[time=2130] to accomplish God's design for the church of God.
[time=2133] The church, the church, God's singular chosen instrument, not the building, the people.
[time=2140] The church set aside to reach out to lovingly embrace and transform a lost and searching world by the power of Christ as we use and exercise our gifts,
[time=2156] spiritual gifts.
[time=2158] Where do we find these gifts?
[time=2159] Well, look with me.
[time=2160] Quickly, we're going to kind of make our way through three of the classic texts in the New Testament.
[time=2165] We're going to start with 1 Corinthians 12, 8 to 10.
[time=2168] 1 Corinthians 12, 8 to 10.
[time=2173] We were just there.
[time=2174] I'm going to keep reading.
[time=2175] And you'll pick a few up as we go.
[time=2176] And then I'm going to bring them up on the screen in just a moment.
[time=2179] 4 to 1 is given the Word of Wisdom.
[time=2182] There's a gift, the Word of Wisdom.
[time=2184] 4 to 1 is given the Word of Wisdom through the Spirit.
[time=2186] And to another, the Word of Knowledge, according to the same Spirit.
[time=2190] It goes on to say to another faith, the gift of faith.
[time=2194] We'll explain that.
[time=2195] By the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing, by the one Spirit.
[time=2199] As the passage continues, it says, "And to another, the affecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another, the distinguishing of spirits,
[time=2209] to another various kinds of tongues, and to another, the interpretation of tongues."
[time=2216] Now we're going to move on to a different passage, I believe 1 Peter chapter 4.
[time=2219] You can turn in your Bibles there.
[time=2221] 1 Peter 4, verses 10 and 11.
[time=2225] It says in 1 Peter 4, 10, and there it is again, "As each one has received a special
[time=2233] or spiritual gift, employ it in serving one another.
[time=2238] As good stewards of the manifold grace of God, whoever speaks, whoever's been gifted to speak, do so.
[time=2245] As one who is speaking the utterances of God, whoever serves, is to do so." This is the gift of helps, whoever serves, or whoever helps is to do so, as one who is
[time=2256] serving by the strength which God supplies so that in all things, God may be glorified
[time=2263] through Jesus Christ to whom belongs to glory and dominion forever and ever.
[time=2268] And then back in Romans 12, if you'll join me there, Romans chapter 12, verses 6 to 8.
[time=2275] Paul writes to the church at Rome about spiritual gifts.
[time=2279] He says, "Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly.
[time=2286] If prophecy according to the proportion of his faith, if service in his serving, or he who teaches in his teaching, or he who exhorts in his exhortation, he who gives with liberality,
[time=2298] he who leads with all diligence, he who shows mercy with cheerfulness."
[time=2305] And there we have a pretty decent listing of the spiritual gifts that God seems to have
[time=2312] addressed and infused, injected into those of us in the body of Christ.
[time=2318] Let me do something here that's a little bit risky just because I would never in any way shape or form want to categorize or box God and what he does or how he works.
[time=2330] But for the purpose of just kind of clarifying and listing and allowing you to see and kind
[time=2337] of identify with certain things here, I'm going to create two categories of gifts.
[time=2342] And it's pretty clear in the text.
[time=2343] There are some gifts that are very blatantly verbal in their expression.
[time=2349] And there are some gifts that aren't, that are very blatantly and clearly non-verbal.
[time=2354] So you've got two columns of gifts.
[time=2355] I want to just kind of go through these gifts.
[time=2357] I want to say a few things about each gift, just quickly, I would encourage you to write them down.
[time=2363] I would encourage you to take this opportunity to, as we go through the gifts, jot a few notes down and you're possibly your ongoing effort to further determine what yours, your one or two or three, folks ask me about that, do we just have one gift?
[time=2378] I believe God gives us really a, I believe he gives us a package of gifts, usually one, two or three that kind of work together in a very unique way.
[time=2387] And so I'd invite you to just kind of take some notes as we go through.
[time=2390] Column number one, I think we started with the verbal gifts, okay?
[time=2393] You can just write these down.
[time=2395] Number one, we see prophecy.
[time=2396] And let me just say this about prophecy.
[time=2399] I'll say a little bit more about it later, but when you see prophecy up there, understand that what we mean by that is, and I believe God's word teaches this, that prophecy has
[time=2411] to do with, the word itself means to proclaim.
[time=2414] It means to herald.
[time=2416] It means to announce.
[time=2417] It means to stand and state that which is true.
[time=2420] And we prophesy that which has been revealed.
[time=2424] And so the prophecy that takes place in the church today, I believe is prophecy or reiteration,
[time=2432] reiteration of what has been revealed.
[time=2434] We believe that the word of God in its total is God's revelation.
[time=2440] And in Revelation 22, 18, it says this, Revelation 22, 18 says, "I testify to everyone who hears
[time=2449] the words of the prophecy of what book, of this book, John here writing at the end, inspired
[time=2457] by the Holy Spirit says, "If anyone adds to them, if anyone stands up in a room, if anybody
[time=2465] comes to you, if anybody pops up in a group and says, I have more revelation for you.
[time=2474] I have a new word for you than we lovingly, I lovingly in those situations, make sure
[time=2482] to try and carefully but forthrightly communicate, no, no you don't, because what He gave us,
[time=2489] He gave us." This is my word and Revelation has been revealed and so we prophesy in the sense of proclaiming
[time=2497] and reiterating and amplifying that which has been spoken.
[time=2503] Knowledge and wisdom.
[time=2505] Let me read this to you.
[time=2506] I came across it last night on the plane or yesterday on the plane, I forget what it was night or day, but I was on the plane and let me just explain these two gifts to you
[time=2516] this way.
[time=2517] We'll start with knowledge.
[time=2519] The word of knowledge, this is the word itself, kind of takes a speaking gift.
[time=2523] This gift may have been revelatory in the first century, but it is today the ability
[time=2529] to understand and speak God's truth with insight into the mysteries of His Word.
[time=2536] There are people in the body of Christ who have been given a gift and the gift is that by God's grace you have great insight into the mysteries of His Word.
[time=2546] You seem to as you study and read, you grasp it, you understand it and you can speak it.
[time=2552] It's this word of knowledge.
[time=2553] The word of wisdom, watch how this works, they're very connected.
[time=2558] Word, word of wisdom indicates again a speaking gift.
[time=2561] In the New Testament, wisdom is most often used of the ability to understand God's Word very similar to knowledge and His will and to skillfully apply that understanding to
[time=2572] life, your own and the life of others.
[time=2574] It makes sense, right?
[time=2575] That's what wisdom is.
[time=2577] Wisdom has insight into this and wisdom has a way of sitting across from you with a cup
[time=2583] of coffee and saying let me help you think this through from a really healthy perspective.
[time=2590] Wisdom, some have been given, that gift, teaching, teaching to interpret, to open this
[time=2596] and to study it and to read it and to interpret and clarify and explain in some kind of public
[time=2603] setting it's meaning.
[time=2605] That's what our teachers do.
[time=2607] They interpret, they study and then they organize it in a clarified fashion to communicate it
[time=2613] and to teach it to God's people.
[time=2617] Exhortation, write that one down, exhortation.
[time=2620] Many of you in this room, most of us in the room have experienced exhortation.
[time=2624] There are many with this gift.
[time=2626] It's the gift of coming alongside others, coming alongside others.
[time=2631] In relationship with others, there's a spiritual gift that allows people to do this in a very effective way and it's twofold.
[time=2638] On one hand, the exhortor can come along and kind of provide you at times with that much
[time=2644] needed spiritual punch in the gut.
[time=2648] Kick in the back.
[time=2651] When you and I are choosing what we shouldn't choose, when you and I are going where we shouldn't go, when you and I are harboring attitudes, we shouldn't harbor, the exhortor comes along based upon the truth of God's word and has a way of communicating confrontation,
[time=2663] admonishment.
[time=2664] They lovingly tell you to wake up and move in a different direction, usually with them.
[time=2672] The exhortor also has a way not on the confrontational front but on the comforting front.
[time=2677] They have a unique way of bringing God's truth through the relationship and the words that they speak and they leave you feeling comforted and encouraged and you and I know how important
[time=2687] that is and how God uses that gift at times in our lives to really further His work, exhortation.
[time=2695] Let's go to the non-verbal side, leadership.
[time=2698] Leadership means the word itself here in the text, it means the one who steers the ship.
[time=2704] Think about the captain of the boat as he looks forward and as he navigates the course, as he first of all sets the course, he then navigates the course, he's seeing these folks
[time=2715] are usually men or women, big picture people.
[time=2718] They see big picture and they think and they live strategically and they love not only
[time=2724] being able to set this course but they love calling other people to join them on the journey.
[time=2730] Leaders, God uses them in great ways, helps, helps, or again you can just write down here
[time=2737] service, basically the person with the gift of helps.
[time=2740] We talked about this during our trip this past week, it came up and it was great just so I think try and boil it down for these men by saying that this is a gift that will basically do anything.
[time=2753] If you need it, this person just has the spiritual gift of wanting to help you accomplish it.
[time=2759] They will clean your house, they will mow your yard, they will give you a ride, they will
[time=2766] take you to the store, they will build sets, we will have a team of men and women who love
[time=2773] and who have the gift of helps, they will decorate this place and they will build a stage and they will all be done to kind of help promote and further God's work through CWB.
[time=2784] There are helpers all over this place, that might be you.
[time=2788] You may not be a teacher, you may not be a preacher, you may not have the gift of wisdom but you may be a great helper and God uses that to accomplish great things.
[time=2798] Giving, giving's an interesting one, giving, oh how do I say this?
[time=2802] Like evangelism, everybody in the family of God, everybody who knows Christ, everybody who has fully surrendered their heart and life to Him, every one of us by virtue of Matthew 28 has been called to fulfill a great commission.
[time=2815] Every one of us has been called to in the day to day of our lives be willing to share our faith, to redemptively reach out to others, everybody.
[time=2824] God also seems to have gifted some Ephesians 4 would indicate to be evangelists.
[time=2830] He's given some, this special dose of that thing and they use it for His glory.
[time=2838] Everybody in the church, everybody who knows the Lord has been called to give.
[time=2842] We've taught on that, we've discussed that here amongst our family for years.
[time=2847] Everybody has the opportunity and privilege and responsibility before God to give financially
[time=2854] to Him on a regular and sacrificial basis, but there are some who have been given this
[time=2860] gift of giving and it's that same idea, it's the giving of resources, but somehow with some people, He's just kind of gotten into their skin, into their soul and they just do it and they do it on a regular basis and they do it generously.
[time=2876] They do it liberally, they do it, they do it with like no holds barred, they just give.
[time=2882] Sometimes you see people like this adjusting their own style of living.
[time=2886] You see them cutting back on things so that they can give more, people with the gift of giving and it's not just the wealthy, it's not about wealth, it's not about whether you have this much or whether you have this much, it's like whatever you have, you just, God's given you this desire to give and so you give.
[time=2903] Mercy, mercy, spiritually able to show great levels of sympathy and sensitivity.
[time=2910] So guys, don't worry about it, if you don't have the gift it's no big deal.
[time=2913] Faith, there's a joke, I was just kidding, everybody should be sympathetic and sensitive.
[time=2919] Some have the special gift of showing great levels of spiritual sympathy and relational sensitivity, the gift of mercy, the gift of faith, not saving faith, write this down,
[time=2930] not saving faith, really persistent trust in God.
[time=2935] These are oftentimes the folks who pray, who pray and pray and pray and pray, they feel
[time=2941] drawn to prayer, they feel at home in prayer, they feel closest to God in prayer.
[time=2946] These are the folks who have faced a great deal in their life and God has gifted them with this gift of faith.
[time=2953] These people are the rocks, these people are the pillars that you and I lean on when times
[time=2959] are tough, they are persistent, consistent prayers and trustors in God and their faith,
[time=2967] this gift of faith, he does great things with it, discernment, the ability to see into a situation.
[time=2974] This is important, very important.
[time=2976] Some in the body have been given this gift, they can see into, do you know somebody like this?
[time=2981] They can see into a situation, somebody kind of runs it by them or they watch from a
[time=2989] distance and they are able to just sense that something is not right, they can, they are
[time=2995] perceptive of error, they can sense an attitude that is maybe a bit out of whack, they just
[time=3002] have a way about them.
[time=3004] These are the folks oftentimes who, if you have the gift of discernment, people are oftentimes coming to your office and saying, hey, can I grab five minutes and run something by you?
[time=3012] I want to get your take.
[time=3015] Sometimes, these are folks who have great insight.
[time=3019] Let me say this, there is a list, what you will not notice there, there is a lot of discussion
[time=3025] about and we can talk about it at length in the days to come, but this morning I want to say this, as it relates to tongues, healing, some of the miracle gifts that Paul mentions
[time=3036] there and Peter mentions, tongues healing, some of the miracle gifts and prophecy.
[time=3040] I've got prophecy in quotes there because, again, there are some who still to this day
[time=3046] believe that they are receiving new words from God and they've got their reasons for
[time=3053] believing that and they will teach that and they will practice that and I just, we want you to know that we don't believe that to be normative for the church today based upon
[time=3064] what we see there in Revelation 22 especially.
[time=3068] We believe that God's word is complete.
[time=3073] Now on the miracle side of things, let me just say this to you, it was really clear in
[time=3079] the early church from Acts 2 on there for a while, it was very, very clear that tongues,
[time=3088] the ability to speak in a language, a language that the speaker, the apostles were going out
[time=3094] to places they had never been and God supernaturally gives them this gift, this ability to preach
[time=3100] and proclaim the gospel in languages and tongues, they didn't even know, but God did that to validate the gospel message and to validate these men and their ministry, these
[time=3113] languages.
[time=3114] Now today in our setting right here, it would appear to me personally that that's not normative
[time=3121] for our experience here, I don't need to speak in a different language for you to understand me, I don't think.
[time=3129] If I did, I would have no questions at all, hear me on this, I get misquoted on this often.
[time=3136] I have no question or doubt that God could do something today.
[time=3141] God could do anything he wanted to do today, if I needed tongues he would I believe give me tongues.
[time=3147] There are places in the world today where the gospel is going for the first time and I get reports, we get reports back of this happening, I have no problem with that.
[time=3155] None, if God chooses to give somebody the gift of another language, so that person can
[time=3161] communicate the gospel wherever he or she might be, I say praise God, in the intent that
[time=3168] we see in Scripture, it appears as if in our setting today in this culture, it appears
[time=3174] as if that was accomplished.
[time=3176] If God wants to change that, I believe God can change that, healing God used human beings
[time=3182] like me, fallen sinful men, God used men, apostles to heal people physically and I believe
[time=3189] he did that, he did those miracles in that time to validate the gospel.
[time=3196] People were questioning these men, this was a whole new deal, it was a whole new day.
[time=3201] So when Paul and Peter and the apostles, when they would physically heal someone, it brought
[time=3207] great validation to the gospel.
[time=3210] Now today I believe that God heals and I believe that God heals miraculously and I have seen
[time=3218] in our own setting here and in other ministry settings I've been in, I have seen us, I have seen the men of the church gather together and anoint an individual with oil and pray and beg for God's healing power but I didn't nor did anybody in those settings slap anybody
[time=3235] on the head or blow on their face and somehow connect the healing with us.
[time=3248] If that were the case then let's go to part view and let's just empty the place.
[time=3256] I believe God heals, I believe he healed through men for a time to validate the gospel.
[time=3261] I believe he heals today and you know what, I'll tell you what again, hear me on this, if somehow, someway in some place and time God chose to do something through me or you
[time=3271] in some direct way, he's free to do that.
[time=3275] I wouldn't constrain or box God in any way, I'm just trying my best to communicate to you how we come at this and it's time to go.
[time=3284] So let me just say this to you, discover your gift.
[time=3288] Please write this down, discover my friends.
[time=3292] Some of you in the room know your gifts and you're using them faithfully, praise God.
[time=3297] Others of you in the room today, if you know him you've got a gift.
[time=3301] You're in the game, discover what your gift is.
[time=3305] Secondly, use it, use it, figure out a way with our help to come alongside the body of
[time=3312] Christ and build it up, equip it, further his work by you using your gift.
[time=3317] I promise you I'll make a deal with you, I'll keep using mine and you keep using yours.
[time=3324] And let's get a few others around us to discover theirs and use theirs.
[time=3328] And I'll just say this my friends next week, after second hour go get a hot dog, get something to eat and join us at the ministry expo and go around and begin to kind of figure out what a couple, two or three first serves are that you would connect with.
[time=3343] One of the best ways for you to discover your gift is to jump into some ministry situations,
[time=3349] try to help out, do what you can and see where the connection takes place.
[time=3354] You might, it might happen the very first time.
[time=3356] You may need two, three or four of them, but I promise you will help you figure this out.
[time=3361] And if you want further study on gifts, talk to your small group leader, talk to your class leader, talk in those settings, maybe think about going through a study of spiritual gifts.
[time=3371] We can help you with that.
[time=3373] Lastly, discover it, use it, now watch this, don't ever, please, please don't ever be constrained by your gift.
[time=3381] And what I mean is this, don't ever, go down this journey, discover your gift, start to
[time=3387] use it, maybe you discover your gift is the gift of teaching.
[time=3390] So you're using your gift of teaching and you're over here just really enjoying the unique design that God's given you and you're using your gift and God's using it and over here somebody needs help moving their refrigerator.
[time=3403] And they say, hey, could you come help me move my refrigerator, please, oh please don't
[time=3411] ever say, hey, I'm really sorry, but that's not my gift.
[time=3416] See now we've just gone from, hey, you know what, it's not my, what, that's not my thing.
[time=3421] Now we've spiritualized it and said, hey, you know what, it's not my gift.
[time=3425] Good luck with the fridge.
[time=3426] No, put your notes down, move away from your lectern and go over there and help the guy
[time=3432] move his fridge, amen?
[time=3435] Don't ever be constrained by them just because you find it and you use it, doesn't mean that in each and every situation we face, we can't collectively kind of cross over gift lines
[time=3447] and help and do whatever we need to do to encourage others and bring great glory to God.
[time=3453] Amen?
[time=3454] Let's stand.
[time=3456] Don't forget tonight, six o'clock, communion and baptism and a great, great opportunity for us to be together as a family.
[time=3465] And if you're a guest this morning, please stop by the guest center on your way out.
[time=3468] Let us meet you, put a name with a face and maybe help you find out a little bit more about our family.
[time=3473] Let's pray.
[time=3474] We thank you for your word and we thank you for what it tells us and teaches us this morning about gifts.
[time=3479] God, thank you for ours.
[time=3481] Thank you for entrusting us with these gifts that mean so much.
[time=3486] God, I pray that everybody in the room this morning that knows you would be faithful to use theirs.
[time=3492] To exercise theirs faithfully.
[time=3495] God, I pray that as we exercise, discover and exercise our gifts, God, that you would
[time=3501] buy your grace and through your power and by your strength, God, that this church, this family, these people, God, would be grown and established and edified and equipped.
[time=3512] God, we look forward to what you'll do.
