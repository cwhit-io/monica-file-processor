[time=108] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I want to thank you for joining us in the concluding message of our series, "A Life Beyond Me." And maybe today's the day.
[time=120] I just want to invite you to come to Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=124] Maybe you've included yourself in our extended church, and you're not attending a local body anywhere else.
[time=131] We'd love for you to make today-to-day that you come visit us, and just be our guest.
[time=137] Say hi if you do.
[time=138] The first service is at 9 a.m., you still have time to get ready and come, or the second service is at 10.45 a.m., and you'll be out just a little bit after 12 noon, so please join us.
[time=149] Also, if you're not available on Sunday mornings to come to our church, and you'd like to join us for our Wednesday night worship service, it's called Common Ground, and it takes place Wednesday nights.
[time=159] It's from 6.45 to 8.15 p.m., and there's also a program for children.
[time=166] So if you want to come and say hi, I do most of those.
[time=170] We have a great time of fun, authentic, purposeful, and relaxed worship and teaching of the Bible.
[time=176] We share prayer requests, and it's just a meaningful, meaningful time to build intimacy in an authentic way with the God of the universe and with those around us.
[time=186] And it doesn't matter where you are on your journey.
[time=189] You're invited to come to Common Ground on Wednesday nights.
[time=193] Also, I want you to be looking and listening and visiting our website at blackhawkministries.org for the upcoming Christmas with Blackhawk ticket information.
[time=202] We will have public ticket distribution in just a few weeks here.
[time=206] So be watching out for that, be planning for that, and visit our website for more details on Christmas with Blackhawk, just a tremendous, tremendous presentation this year.
[time=217] You know, the message you're about to see to conclude our series on a life beyond me, his Jesus answering, "I think the three most important questions we will ever address in our lives." And those questions are, "Who am I?
[time=231] What am I called to do and why?
[time=235] Who am I?
[time=236] What am I called to do and why?
[time=240] Who am I? That's our identity.
[time=242] What am I called to do? That's our initiative.
[time=246] And why is the influence, it's our influence of who we are and what we do.
[time=251] Jesus answers those three questions with two metaphors, salt and light.
[time=257] And we hear a lot that Jesus commanded us to be salt and to be light.
[time=261] He did not.
[time=263] He told us that we are the salt and we are the light, that that's our identity.
[time=269] And salt and light not only have an identity, they have an initiative.
[time=273] Salt adds flavor, salt preserves, light illuminates.
[time=278] And then each has an influence.
[time=282] Salt makes somebody thirsty, adds flavor, draws out flavor, it's for taste is the influence, and light helps people see.
[time=292] Well, he uses those metaphors as a disciple, actually as a disciple, under the scrutiny of an inspection, not only by God, but by the world around him.
[time=303] And Jesus said, who you are, your identity as a disciple, is that you're a servant.
[time=309] You're a servant of the king, you're a servant of Christ, and you're a servant of others.
[time=315] And he says the initiative, what you're called to do is to serve, to actually seek needs and meet those needs of others.
[time=323] And then the influence, why, what this whole thing is about, Jesus says, is so that he uses that, so others will surrender their hearts and their lives to him.
[time=332] It's very simple, but yet very, very clear.
[time=337] And one of the things that we'll see here is that our identity and our initiative, in Christ, are inseparable.
[time=345] Who we are and what we do, in Christ, are inseparable.
[time=350] And the influence that that has is that others will be drawn to surrender to him.
[time=356] This is the meaning of life.
[time=358] This is something that will change your life if you can get your mind around what God's called you to do,
[time=366] who he's called you to be, what he's called you to do, and the influence that he's designed it to have.
[time=371] This is the truth.
[time=373] And so maybe grab a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate, sit back, enjoy the worship,
[time=379] do a little examination with the Spirit of God and your soul, allow him to move in you.
[time=385] And just at the conclusion of this, I'd just love for you to ask yourself those three questions, God, who am I?
[time=391] What have you called me to do and why?
[time=395] Thank you so much for joining us.
[time=396] And be sure to come and visit us and say hello when you do, either Sunday morning, today, or Wednesday night, thank you.
[time=403] The clouds be rolled back as a throne.
[time=416] The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
[time=429] even so, it is well with my soul.
[time=442] It is well, it is well with my soul, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=472] It is well with my soul, it is well with my soul.
[time=486] I want to ask you this morning, is it well with your soul really?
[time=515] Is it well with your soul really?
[time=521] You know each one of us came in here today with a soul that is all jumped up.
[time=525] Our mind, our will, and our emotions, just in many cases a mess.
[time=533] Reminds how we think, thoughts, our wills, our choices, and our emotions, our feelings.
[time=541] And I want to ask you today, is it well with your soul really?
[time=547] You know the guy that penned those words, Horatio Spafford, was a wealthy attorney in Chicago,
[time=553] and he lost almost everything in the 1871 fire.
[time=558] And he scrounged out what he had left of his resources, and he sent his four daughters and his wife to Jerusalem on a ship where he was going to open a hotel.
[time=568] And on the way the ship that traveled with his four daughters and his wife collided with another and it sank.
[time=579] And his wife was found later by rescuers on a piece of driftwood, and the four daughters didn't make it,
[time=585] and she sent him a telegram with two words, saved alone.
[time=591] And so we got on a ship, and when he got to the spot where he knew he had lost his daughters,
[time=601] he wrote this poem, which is now a hymn.
[time=605] And he said, "It's well with my soul, because he knew who David referred to as the restorer of the soul.
[time=615] And so I want to ask you this morning, is it well with your soul really?
[time=622] Do you need to bring to the restorer of the soul right now, that which is jucking up your life, that which is jucking up your soul?"
[time=636] And so what I'd like you to do is close your eyes and as a symbol of what we're going to do here, I want you to hold your hands palms up.
[time=645] So close your eyes and hold your hands palms up, and the team's going to sing one more time.
[time=652] And I want you to come to the restorer of the soul right now and ask him to take what it is that he needs to take.
[time=660] And what Horatio Spafford knew and what you know today is that he right now, right here with the humble heart, surrendered to him, he will restore your soul.
[time=672] The last few weeks have been very difficult for me.
[time=675] I've had a mostly intensive working in my soul by the spirit of God that I can't hardly describe.
[time=685] And what has seemed to parallel that has been a tremendous awareness of my sin, my desire for life apart from God.
[time=698] And I'm going to join you here right now with palms up as they sing.
[time=706] They're going to sing that line, "My sin not in part but the whole." And I just want you to palms up, soul open, come to the restorer of the soul like I am right now and say, "God, restore my soul."
[time=722] I see all the bliss of this glory as thought.
[time=737] My sin not in part but the whole.
[time=752] He's nailed to the loss and I bear in no more.
[time=765] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh, my soul.
[time=780] It is well with my soul, with my soul.
[time=795] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=810] Well, this morning, as I said, we continue, actually we conclude this six-week study, what a study it's been.
[time=819] And we are so thankful for the privilege that is ours.
[time=822] Today Mitchell is here with me, Pastor Mitchell Cruz, part of our teaching team and we have the privilege of drawing your attention again to the Scriptures
[time=830] and this morning a passage in the book of Matthew and a message that we've entitled, "Service that leads to surrender."
[time=837] And Mitch is going to get us going this morning.
[time=842] Today we believe that Jesus answers three questions in the text that are three of the most important questions, if not the most important questions, we will ever answer.
[time=852] And it's who am I, what am I supposed to do, and why, who am I, what's my identity, who am I supposed to do, what's the initiative I'm to take,
[time=866] and why, what's the influence, or what's the purpose.
[time=871] And I will share with you a story that involves identity and initiative and influence.
[time=877] Some of you know, some of you don't, that my whole life used to be selling collector cars at auction.
[time=882] And I was in Scottsdale, Arizona, several years ago, when a .com multi-millionaire walked into his very first collector car auction.
[time=891] And up comes on the turntable, a beautifully restored 1937 Mercedes-Benz supercharged four-door convertible, believed to be the only one in the world.
[time=901] So the auction, the price is going up and it's approaching $700,000 and I learned later he leaned over to his wife and he says, "Watch this."
[time=911] And he puts his hand up and sold $670,000 and it was a great moment.
[time=917] Until a little closer scrutiny revealed that the car's identity was not what was described.
[time=927] Now see, it looked like a .37 Mercedes supercharged four-door convertible, it looked like it should.
[time=936] In fact, parts of it were authentic and it did what .37 Mercedes supercharged four-door convertibles did.
[time=945] And its influence was the kind of influence that a car like that has.
[time=950] Somebody will pay $670,000 for it.
[time=955] But in the end, the car under the scrutiny of a closer inspection was pretend.
[time=963] What we're going to look at today is our identity, who we are, where to be servants, servants.
[time=973] Our initiative is to serve.
[time=978] And our influence, which we'll see, is God uses that for surrender.
[time=984] And what I want you to get today is that there is no pretense with God.
[time=990] You cannot pretend that your identity is a servant of the king, if you're not.
[time=997] Servants of the king will serve and it will lead to the king drawing people to surrender.
[time=1004] Today, Jesus talks about service that leads to surrender.
[time=1009] So if you could please stand, we're going to read the passage.
[time=1012] Jesus is at the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1014] He's just said his disciples down.
[time=1016] He's gone through the Beatitudes and he's talked a little bit about persecution for being a follower of his.
[time=1022] And probably 20,000 people are around.
[time=1026] And here's what he says.
[time=1028] Matthew 5, 13 through 16.
[time=1032] You are the salt of the earth.
[time=1036] But if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again?
[time=1042] It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
[time=1049] You are the light of the world.
[time=1052] A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
[time=1055] Nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket but on the lamp stand.
[time=1060] And it gives light to all who are in the house.
[time=1064] Let your light shine.
[time=1066] Let your light shine before man in such a way that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven.
[time=1076] Let's pray.
[time=1078] And now, God, may it be so.
[time=1080] May your Holy Spirit touch the spirit of every single person here with service that leads to surrender.
[time=1086] God, may we realize today through your word and through your spirit revealing your word to us that our identity is that of a servant.
[time=1095] And the initiative what we are called to do is to serve.
[time=1099] And God, that the influence that that has is that you use it for surrender.
[time=1105] Service that leads to surrender.
[time=1107] God, may the words from Cali may not be ours but yours.
[time=1111] And we pray this in Jesus mighty name.
[time=1114] [AMEN] You may be seated.
[time=1120] Number one, we see here in our passage as it begins to unfold.
[time=1123] And if you've got a pen, you can write this down.
[time=1125] I want to draw your attention first of all to the fact that we see our identity.
[time=1129] God, in His word here, in this passage in Matthew 5, He reveals through the words of Jesus our identity.
[time=1137] Very important thing for you and I to consider.
[time=1139] It says in verses 13 and 14, if you look there in your Bible, you can just see as you look at the beginning of 13, the beginning of 14.
[time=1146] These two very powerful phrases.
[time=1148] It says you are the light.
[time=1150] You are, excuse me, verse 13, you are the salt of the earth.
[time=1155] You are the light of the world.
[time=1158] I want you to think about that this morning.
[time=1160] I don't know how your imagination is.
[time=1162] I don't know how creative you can be mentally right now.
[time=1165] I don't know if you've had enough coffee or if you're plugged in enough to the discussion yet.
[time=1169] But I want you to think about that.
[time=1170] I want you to envision.
[time=1171] I want you to just right now in your mind's eye kind of come up with a picture that describes what that looks like.
[time=1177] You are the salt.
[time=1179] We could have some fun with this.
[time=1180] Think about it.
[time=1181] You're the salt of the earth.
[time=1184] You're the light of the world, he says.
[time=1189] What does that mean?
[time=1190] What does that look like?
[time=1192] Envision that picture that.
[time=1195] You're the salt.
[time=1196] You are.
[time=1197] It doesn't say you might be.
[time=1198] It doesn't say you have potential to be.
[time=1199] It says you are.
[time=1201] In relationship with him, he says you are.
[time=1204] The salt of the earth, the light of the world.
[time=1208] I love passages like this.
[time=1210] I love all.
[time=1211] I love all truth.
[time=1212] I love all passage.
[time=1213] I love passages like this.
[time=1216] I love passages like this where God takes a couple few verses and just packs them with divine insight.
[time=1224] Life-changing, life-shaping truth.
[time=1227] I got to tell you, 23 years ago, right after I had first come to faith in Christ, many of you know that story.
[time=1233] I've shared it with you in the past, and I was probably maybe two, three months into that journey of knowing him.
[time=1238] And it was in that church where I came to know Christ that I heard for the first time someone preached through
[time=1244] and teach through this passage right here today where we find ourselves.
[time=1248] You are the salt of the earth.
[time=1250] You are the light of the world, and it changed me.
[time=1254] It shaped me.
[time=1255] It formed me.
[time=1256] I got to tell you, 23 years ago, and now we come to this passage again.
[time=1260] I cannot begin to tell you the possibilities that exist right here for you and for me this morning to have our hearts
[time=1268] and our lives and our minds and our faith stretched and grown and shaped by this great truth in just these few verses.
[time=1279] As I believe in these two verses, the Lord summarizes the singular and paramount priority of all Christian living.
[time=1290] It's a big statement, I realize, but I think it's very true.
[time=1293] He takes all of this, and it's as if in relationship to our function, our purpose, our calling in life,
[time=1301] he kind of brings it all together and says, "You are the salt of the earth.
[time=1308] You are the light of the world." Now you want to whittle all that down?
[time=1315] Some folks, I don't like to whittle things down.
[time=1317] They like to get down to the basic common thread, the basic common denominator.
[time=1322] If you want to do that with these two truths, if you want to do that with this passage, I believe you can.
[time=1328] I believe our text this morning will reveal that the one word, as you look at this passage, if we whittle it all down,
[time=1335] would be the word influence.
[time=1339] God has given you and I this unspeakable privilege of being influencers in this world that he has placed us in,
[time=1348] in this body of Christ that you and I belong to.
[time=1352] The scriptures teach that we as Christ followers have been divinely designed by God to influence, to impact this broken and searching world as well as the body of Christ, the churches to influence culture,
[time=1364] all of culture, struggling culture, immoral culture, debauched culture, confused culture.
[time=1373] All of it, we have the opportunity to influence.
[time=1378] And Jesus says this can be done because we are salt.
[time=1382] What does that mean?
[time=1384] We are light, but comes to your mind.
[time=1389] Well, I'll tell you this, if we're salt and if we're light, what I believe the text presupposes,
[time=1395] and I would stand here and agree with this, you may disagree, you may want to debate this, you may have some reservations about this, I would just say from the bottom of my heart and from the study of God's Word
[time=1406] and from our experience here in the everyday of life, I would say that this world of ours needs both.
[time=1413] I would say that this world of ours needs salt because I believe it is corrupt in its very nature,
[time=1423] at its base bottom line level, I believe this world of ours, this society, humanness and the sinfulness that comes with it,
[time=1432] I believe is corrupt, maybe a better word more appropriate for the terms we're using today is rotten or rotting.
[time=1442] And I believe our world is dark.
[time=1447] I believe society as a whole, man left to himself.
[time=1451] I believe it's dark and you know what, I think it's getting darker.
[time=1457] It's why moms throw babies into the ocean.
[time=1461] It's why violent crime is on the rise, that's why you, you know what, you just read what, you just pick up a newspaper.
[time=1470] You just watch the news.
[time=1474] You just talk to your teenager after a day at school.
[time=1480] It's dark.
[time=1482] It's not getting lighter, it's getting darker.
[time=1485] Jesus says to you and I today that we are the salt and the light.
[time=1490] So what does it mean for you and I to be salt?
[time=1494] Let me tell you this, before we jump into it, there have been many interpretations of what Jesus meant when he said, for instance, you're the salt.
[time=1501] Let me say this about salt before we just go through a few of those and land.
[time=1506] In this day, in the context, you always want to study the scripture, you always want to read God's Word in the context.
[time=1514] Not only the immediate context here in these pages, but the context within which it was spoken.
[time=1519] And Jesus finds himself on the side of a hill outside the city of Jerusalem.
[time=1524] This is in the midst of the Sermon on the Mount and in first century Jewish culture.
[time=1529] Actually, first century Roman culture, first century Greek culture, it wouldn't matter on this one.
[time=1534] In this day, if you talked about salt, you talked about something that was very, very valuable.
[time=1542] People got paid with salt.
[time=1546] You can imagine. Wars were fought. Wars were fought. Over salt.
[time=1550] People got paid with salt. Salt was like gold to the folks in the first century audience that would have heard him use these phrases.
[time=1561] And so when he says you are the salt of the earth, whatever he meant by that, which we'll talk about, one thing you and I can know for sure,
[time=1568] that just the mention of it helped these people understand that this function, this calling that he was bringing them to was something of great importance.
[time=1578] Something that was extremely vile and to be valued.
[time=1583] He said you are the salt of the earth.
[time=1587] So what does this mean that we're salt? Some would say, you know, I've read a lot on this.
[time=1592] Mitchell has read a lot on this. We have studied. You can open up commentaries.
[time=1596] Many different perspectives on this. Some would say that salt is white in color and represents the purity that should be present in our love for him and our service to others.
[time=1608] Not a bad idea. Not an altogether, you know, horrible interpretation.
[time=1614] But as you study the text, you realize that the saltiness of salt is what Jesus is referring to here.
[time=1623] Not so much the color, so you can kind of move on from that.
[time=1626] When others would emphasize the issue of flavor, maybe you've heard that said before, salt has flavor.
[time=1632] Salt brings flavor, saying that when we live out our faith with others, when we live out our faith in the body of Christ, when we live out our faith with those far from God, that we bring value or a greater taste, if you will, to those around us.
[time=1646] It could be. Some think you are the salt of the earth means that because salt creates thirst, that Jesus is saying we are to faithfully live out our faith in such a way that someone far from God might see our patience.
[time=1664] They might witness or observe your humility. They might notice your acts of kindness.
[time=1670] Somebody far from God or even somebody in the body might as you live out your faith be made aware of their own spiritual need or thirst.
[time=1680] Maybe that's happened to you before. Maybe somebody has lived out their faith in your presence and in them living out their faith that kind of reveals what's lacking in you.
[time=1691] There's this thirst that comes with that. Very well could be. There have been many interpretations. I think there's one, though, that makes even more sense, especially in light of the text.
[time=1704] I believe the text speaks to the issue of, and you can write this down, preservation.
[time=1711] Salt, my friends, is a preservative. Do we understand this? If we have a cooler of steaks and we leave that cooler of steaks out and we don't do anything to it, you give it a day or two and the steaks become rotten.
[time=1729] You take those same steaks and you pack them in that cooler and you pack them covered with and surrounded by salt and those steaks are, for a time, preserved.
[time=1742] They don't turn rotten. They stay fresh. They get better.
[time=1749] I believe the text speaks to this issue of preservation. My friends you and I, in relationship with Christ, we've been given this unspeakable privilege of being salt.
[time=1758] Packed in around the reality of this world that we live in. In proximity, see I hope you're in proximity. I hope you're in relationship. I hope you're living close enough.
[time=1773] I hope you're around it enough. I hope you're involved with it enough. I hope there is in your day to day of life this opportunity to live out your faith in such proximity that you are able to function as salt.
[time=1787] A preservative. God in His providence, He brings people to faith. God in His sovereignty, He does work in people's hearts and lives and I believe He uses you.
[time=1800] And I believe He uses me as we live out our salty faith to preserve what's going on in that bigger grander scheme, that picture that He has.
[time=1811] I'll tell you what's interesting when you look at 2 Thessalonians 2 and you study what takes place during the end times.
[time=1820] It's interesting that when the church is removed from the scene, I believe it's 2 Thessalonians 2, 7 to 12, you should read it sometimes.
[time=1829] When the church is removed from the scene, everything just goes south quick. I'm talking about evil.
[time=1838] I'm talking about unrighteousness. You see, there is a sense where God allows you and I, the church, the body of Christ, to stay in this cooler of meat packed in here, doing our preservation work, our preserving work.
[time=1851] God's preserving work through us. But you and I know that day will come when we will no longer have that opportunity, that relationship.
[time=1863] Salt preserves. And you know what light does, my friends? Just real briefly. You know what light does? Most of you know what light does?
[time=1870] Two things. I want you to think about. Light, when it's dark and light comes in, light exposes. Light brings clarity.
[time=1882] And not only does it bring clarity, but light in its clarity allows those who were in the darkness to see their way to the door, if you will.
[time=1891] To see their way to the path. Light comes into darkness and it exposes and it reveals. You and I have the opportunity.
[time=1899] In proximity, in relationship with others to be a preserving force that also brings light, exposing and pointing, hopefully lovingly, the way through.
[time=1910] I can't tell you how many times someone has come along. Maybe it's happened with you. I can't tell you how many times somebody has been a light.
[time=1920] Been a light into my marriage. How many times someone's come along and been a light into my parenting?
[time=1931] I can't tell you how many times somebody close to me has come along and they've been a light into the disciplines of my life and the things that I desperately need needed and need to work at.
[time=1946] And I tell you what, whether it's you and I in the body of Christ or whether it's the opportunities God gives us outside the body of Christ.
[time=1953] I've got a couple of friends right now and they say it to me, they say it to me often.
[time=1959] A couple of guys who don't know the Lord and they say to me, "You know what? They say, Kelly, it's amazing.
[time=1966] We have these conversations and when you say what you say and when you let me into your life and I see what I see, I feel convicted.
[time=1974] I don't feel beat on. I don't feel fumped on the back of the head. I just feel convicted.
[time=1980] I feel like something should change in me," they say. Maybe you've had those conversations.
[time=1985] You and I get to be, hopefully lovingly, salt and light, salt and light, preserving and shining a loving light that not only exposes but points away to the door.
[time=1997] That is our identity. You are the salt of the earth. You are the light of the world.
[time=2004] Our initiative. What is it that we do?
[time=2006] Mitchell, show us here in these next few verses.
[time=2009] Well, our initiative is to serve. I want to write that down.
[time=2012] Our identity is that we're servants and our initiative is that we serve.
[time=2016] Let me just kind of recap 13 and 14 again.
[time=2019] It says, "You are what Kelly said. You are the salt of the earth. You are the light of the world. End of story.
[time=2025] You are if you are in Christ." Can I say this real quick?
[time=2029] Yes. It just came to my mind. Not only do you and I have the privilege of being light, but most importantly, my friends, this is the light.
[time=2038] Psalm 119 says that thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[time=2048] It is the opportunity that God gives you and I to be this, but again, fundamentally and most importantly, it's when this is lived out.
[time=2056] It's when this is proclaimed. It's when this is modeled. The light.
[time=2062] I just want to make sure we made that point.
[time=2064] That's great. Go down to verse 15.
[time=2068] And Jesus says, "Nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket but on the lampstand.
[time=2074] And it gives light to all who are in the house. So let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works."
[time=2084] So we know that good works is the initiative of salt and lights.
[time=2089] So serving good works must be the initiative. So therefore, salt and light must mean that I'm a servant of Christ.
[time=2098] I'm a servant of Christ because salt and light Jesus refers to as what they do.
[time=2104] Their initiative is serving or good deeds, and it's the way that He designed it.
[time=2111] And I think what we'll see here is that identity and initiative, who I am and what I'm called to do, are inseparable.
[time=2119] They're inseparable. In fact, let me say it this way. They're in Christ and inseparable.
[time=2125] Turn to Ephesians 2, 10, Ephesians 2, 10.
[time=2132] While you're turning there, you know, He said that salt doesn't lose its taste.
[time=2139] It didn't, you know. Sodium chloride is a stable compound, and it cannot lose its saltiness.
[time=2147] In quantum physics, light is the absolute. Light doesn't change.
[time=2155] So you are the salt, and you are the light when you are in Christ as a disciple, as a fully surrendered follower of His end of story.
[time=2165] And so therefore, you're a servant of the King, and you will serve.
[time=2169] And it happens our identity is in Christ, and the identity and initiative are inseparable.
[time=2175] Okay? Now, the only reason you would put that two-gallon bowl that it's talking about on the light,
[time=2181] in a modest home in Jewish Palestine, you would have this lamp, this oil lamp.
[time=2188] It kind of looks like the genie bottle and the laden with holes on it, and there would be a wick in there, and it would be burning. And you'd put it on the top of a lamp stand so it would light the whole house.
[time=2197] Right? The only reason you'd put this two-gallon bowl that it refers to there, on top of it, is to extinguish the light.
[time=2206] And so what Jesus is saying is that your identity and your initiative are inseparable in Christ,
[time=2212] because here's what happened.
[time=2214] People claimed to be salt and claimed to be light. They claimed to be in Christ.
[time=2219] But under the scrutiny, remember the scrutiny of the inspection of the Mercedes?
[time=2223] Under the scrutiny of the inspection of the world and of God 2,000 years ago, and even today they proved not to be salt and not to be light, and therefore the salt is trampled underfoot by men when people would see the hypocrisy.
[time=2237] They would just trample over that person underfoot.
[time=2240] And then that's the only way a light could be extinguished if it never really was the light of Christ to begin with.
[time=2246] Which is insightful because in the context that we're in here in 13 through 16, the verses that came before that, the verses that come just before this, blessed are those back in the Beatitudes, blessed are those who have been persecuted.
[time=2259] Blessed are you in verse 11 when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
[time=2268] The whole context here is what Mitchell is describing.
[time=2272] We're going to be under the scrutiny. Difficult times.
[time=2275] Times that reveal who you and I really, really are.
[time=2280] Now let's get personal. Ephesians 2, 10.
[time=2283] For we are His workmanship.
[time=2285] If our identity is in Christ, we're His workmanship created in Christ Jesus.
[time=2290] For good works. There it is again. Good works.
[time=2293] Which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
[time=2297] The designer has designed it so that the identity in Christ and the initiative are inseparable.
[time=2304] For we are His workmanship. The Greek word there is poemay.
[time=2308] It's where we get our word poem.
[time=2310] And every time you and I serve another human being, we are God's poem, God's salt, God's light, God's poem to our world, to our culture.
[time=2322] Let's get real personal. Let's look at James 2, verses 14 through 17.
[time=2328] James 2 verses 14 through 17.
[time=2333] While you're turning there, there was this rabbinical saying prior to Jesus' time that salt cannot lose its saltiness. It was actually phrased as a question.
[time=2343] And so I really believe that our identity in Christ determines our initiative.
[time=2348] That if we're in Christ, we're servants, and our initiative is that we will serve.
[time=2353] We will be characterized and known by it.
[time=2356] Our identity and our initiative in Christ are inseparable.
[time=2361] Now let's look at James, what he says in chapter 2 verses 14 through 17.
[time=2365] What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith, but has no works,
[time=2372] can that faith save him?
[time=2375] If a brother or sister is without clothing in a need of daily food, and one of you says to them, "Go in peace. Be warmed and be filled." And yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body.
[time=2388] What use is that? Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead being by itself.
[time=2396] Faith without works is dead. It does not exist.
[time=2400] Identity as a servant leads to the initiative of serving in Christ.
[time=2407] The identity and the initiative are inseparable.
[time=2412] You with me? In Christ, our identity as servants
[time=2418] and our initiative to serve are inseparable.
[time=2422] And under the scrutiny of the world, those who are not really Saul and those who are not really light will be exposed.
[time=2430] Good works serving another human being.
[time=2435] 300 of us did it when we served outside the church and we went and met needs.
[time=2441] And it's amazing what happened.
[time=2444] Today our focus is about inside the four walls and how we can serve people inside the four walls that we ask to come from our culture.
[time=2452] And remember, we're designed to serve 24/7.
[time=2457] We talked about ordinary opportunities in our daily lives, in our families, in our work with our friends.
[time=2463] Wherever we go, we open a door, we serve through our careers, we serve our spouses, we serve our families, that all happens within our agenda, and then there's our agenda adjusters.
[time=2472] Our agenda adjusters, the poor, the people in need, who say, "If you're willing, you can make me clean." And we have to adjust our agenda to serve.
[time=2484] But if your identity is in Christ and you're a servant,
[time=2490] you will take the initiative to serve those agenda adjusters.
[time=2496] Before we went out, I shared this story.
[time=2500] Before we went out and did the big serve.
[time=2502] And so I want to share it with the rest of you, because I think it really sums up this situation of what Jesus is saying.
[time=2511] A peasant had one acre and he had a garden.
[time=2514] And the best he had to offer out of that garden was a carrot.
[time=2518] And so he went to the king, whose land was next door to his, and he said, "Here," and he gave him the carrot.
[time=2526] And the king said, "Thank you." You know what? I'm going to give you a hundred acres.
[time=2533] Your land's next to mine, right? Yep.
[time=2535] I'm going to give you a hundred acres.
[time=2537] I just want to show my appreciation for you.
[time=2540] And a nobleman was watching all this, and he thought to himself, "A hundred acres for a carrot, I wonder what I would get for a horse." So he takes a horse and he gives it to the king, and the king says, "Thank you, be on your way." And the nobleman says, "I don't get it." The peasant gave you a carrot and you gave him a hundred acres.
[time=2562] I gave you a horse and you didn't give me anything.
[time=2566] And the king says to the nobleman, "The peasant gave his gift to me." You gave your gift to yourself.
[time=2578] And people, I think that's what Jesus is saying.
[time=2582] We are designed to take our identity and to give it to serve other people, to serve the king.
[time=2591] And it's quite possible that you're sitting here today and you've used your gifts really just to serve yourself.
[time=2598] And I want to challenge you today, and I'm challenging myself by saying this, that if our identity is in Christ, then our initiative is that we will serve.
[time=2609] Our identity and our initiative in Christ are inseparable.
[time=2614] And we've been designed to serve the king, and we can only serve the king if we serve others.
[time=2626] And watch this.
[time=2630] Watch what God does.
[time=2634] Watch what He does. Be amazed all over again with what God does, with your willingness and your readiness in mind to be servants who serve, who do good deeds, not deeds that save us, deeds that evidence we've been saved and redeemed.
[time=2657] Watch what He does.
[time=2661] Back in our text, it says in chapter 5, verse 16, "Let your light shine before men, in such a way that they may men, in such a way that men, those observing, those watching, those being impacted by, let your light shine in such a way." You see it there?
[time=2682] "That they may see your good works." And do what? Read it out loud, say it.
[time=2690] Glorify your Father who is in heaven.
[time=2694] That, my friends, is a very, very powerful statement.
[time=2697] And as you read this text and as you study other texts, you realize that this is a very common theme.
[time=2704] This miraculous truth is a very common theme throughout Scripture.
[time=2709] We see God doing this.
[time=2710] We see God through the works, through the service of others.
[time=2715] He can do it different ways than He does, but one way that He does it, one way that He brings people far from God to Himself.
[time=2723] One way that He encourages those already in the family is through your good works, your service, your teaching of a class, your raking of a yard.
[time=2735] Inside and outside.
[time=2738] Inside the body of Christ.
[time=2739] Look what it says in 1 Peter chapter 4.
[time=2741] We talked about this a few weeks ago as we, our last week actually is we talked about gifts.
[time=2745] Look at the wording again in 1 Peter 4.
[time=2747] Again, a passage that deals with life inside the body of Christ.
[time=2751] He's talking about gifts.
[time=2753] He says whoever speaks is to do so, verse 11, as one who is speaking the utterances of God.
[time=2758] Whoever serves is to do so, as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies, so that in all things, God may be what?
[time=2766] Say it.
[time=2767] Glorify.
[time=2768] By those in the family here, obviously, glorify through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever.
[time=2776] Your service, your willingness to serve allows those already convinced to give great glory and honor to God.
[time=2785] But look back a few pages.
[time=2786] Go to chapter 2.
[time=2788] 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 12.
[time=2790] Peter says keep your, you there?
[time=2792] Keep your 1 Peter 2, 12.
[time=2793] Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles.
[time=2798] Gentiles would have been in this context, those who were far from God.
[time=2802] Those outside the family of God.
[time=2804] Keep your behavior excellent among them, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers, they may because of you or what?
[time=2812] Say it.
[time=2813] Good deeds.
[time=2814] Good deeds as they observe them, do what?
[time=2817] Say it.
[time=2818] Glorify God.
[time=2819] Glorify God in the day of visitation.
[time=2823] Servants who serve leading at times to surrender.
[time=2829] It's a great picture.
[time=2831] Write these passages down.
[time=2833] Would you just get a pen, Rocha?
[time=2834] I want to give you some things to look at today.
[time=2836] I want to give you a few passages to look at tonight.
[time=2838] Would you take these passages and would you as a small group or a home group, would you as a class, would you with some friends, would you on your own, would you with your kids tonight before you go to bed?
[time=2849] Would you just look at a few of these?
[time=2851] Write these down.
[time=2852] Matthew 9 verses 1 to 8.
[time=2854] Write that down.
[time=2855] Won't be on the screen.
[time=2856] Just write it down.
[time=2857] Write down, Matthew 9, 1 through 8.
[time=2860] Matthew 15, 31.
[time=2864] Mark 2, 12.
[time=2867] And look at the verses surrounding these verses that I'm giving you.
[time=2871] Luke 2, 20.
[time=2873] Luke 5, 25 and 26.
[time=2877] Luke 7, verse 16.
[time=2879] Luke 7, 16.
[time=2881] Luke 13, 13.
[time=2884] Luke 17, 15.
[time=2888] John 15, verse 8.
[time=2891] And look at Acts chapter 4, verse 24.
[time=2894] And again, the verses surrounding these verses.
[time=2897] I just want you to see it for yourself.
[time=2899] I want you to look tonight or this afternoon or tomorrow with a few friends or folks that you live life with.
[time=2904] Look and see how this happens.
[time=2906] It happens again and again and again.
[time=2909] God uses good works.
[time=2911] God uses service to encourage the body of Christ, allowing them to bring great glory and honor and praise to God.
[time=2918] And he uses good works to actually bring people to salvation.
[time=2924] And it's so encouraging for me.
[time=2925] I'll just tell you this.
[time=2926] It's so encouraging for Mitchell.
[time=2928] It reminds Mitchell and it reminds me and it reminds our team and it should remind every one of you.
[time=2937] God doesn't, first of all, God doesn't need us, right?
[time=2941] But he chose to use us.
[time=2942] So in using it, using us, it reminds us that he doesn't need bells and whistles to bring people to himself.
[time=2952] It doesn't have to be really complicated.
[time=2956] It's a very simple picture, really.
[time=2959] He penetrates and comes into, he moves into the hearts and lives
[time=2965] of people and he brings them to faith those outside the family.
[time=2969] And he encourages in a deep and profound way not through complicated strategy and bells and whistles in ministry, but through Christ followers who serve.
[time=2984] End of equation.
[time=2987] Christ followers who serve.
[time=2989] Inside and outside these four walls because that's who you are.
[time=2994] You are the salt of the earth.
[time=2997] You are the light of the world.
[time=2999] Let me show you what happens.
[time=3001] Lights are going to go down.
[time=3003] Please don't leave.
[time=3004] Please watch this.
[time=3005] Be encouraged.
[time=3006] I want you to watch the screens.
[time=3008] And I just want you to see an example.
[time=3011] I know most, everybody you're about to see in these pictures, not all, but I know most of them.
[time=3018] And most of them wound up in these pictures because somebody in their life or somebody's in their life was willing to serve.
[time=3029] To serve them or to serve those around them, but watch.
[time=3032] Watch this morning.
[time=3033] Be encouraged.
[time=3034] Listen to the words of the song and be so very encouraged at what happens when the body of Christ serves.
[time=3041] It leads to surrender.
