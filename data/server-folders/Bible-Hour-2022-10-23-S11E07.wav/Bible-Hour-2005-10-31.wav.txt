[time=47] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=59] And therefore go and make disciples of all of them, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

[time=75] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you.
[time=78] And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.

[time=89] [MUSIC]
[time=99] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=102] And let me just say thank you again for joining us on the broadcast.
[time=106] I'm so thankful that we get to spend this time together and so grateful today to be able to bring to you a segment here,
[time=113] a segment that we have in recent months really, really enjoyed being able to do.
[time=118] We call it Celebrating the Church of Fort Wayne.
[time=121] And God has really been teaching me.
[time=124] Personally, He has been really growing us here at Black Hawk in our collaborative hearts.
[time=130] And what I mean by that is we have realized something we probably should have realized years and years ago,
[time=136] and that is that God has put in Fort Wayne and in this surrounding community.
[time=141] A lot of really, really good people, a lot of incredibly effective ministries, churches, just like ours,
[time=148] who are doing their best with God's help to reach people and love people and encourage people.
[time=154] And instead of competing with churches like so many times, you know, we've done in the past,
[time=160] God's really been growing our hearts to celebrate them, to embrace them, to encourage them,
[time=167] to come alongside and learn from them and encourage them in what they're doing.
[time=172] We are having a great time in a collaborative way of appreciating and learning from the Church of Fort Wayne.
[time=180] I've met a new friend in recent days and his name is Jeff Carroll.
[time=184] And I'm so thankful for the relationship that God has given us.
[time=187] I met Jeff this past summer here at Black Hawk at our Leadership Summit.
[time=192] And we were able to strike up a friendship, and I learned that Jeff and his wife and family have been here for about a year and a half.
[time=199] They come to the Fort Wayne area, actually Huntington, Jeff is the senior pastor at Union Church there in the Huntington area,
[time=206] and they have come to Huntington from Paducah, Kentucky.
[time=210] I love saying that word, Paducah.
[time=212] They are a year and a half at Union Church, and God has been doing some really encouraging, some really amazing things
[time=220] that have really encouraged us.
[time=222] And so, Jeff and I's friendship, I thought it would just be appropriate for him to come, and to share with you a little bit about what's going on these days at Union Church.
[time=231] Many of you who watch the broadcast may be in that neighborhood.
[time=236] In Paducah, maybe they would say that neck of the woods, but maybe you're around there.
[time=242] Maybe that's not a far drive for you.
[time=244] Maybe you'd want to go and see for yourself.
[time=247] So, I just would love it, Jeff, if you would share with the audience what God's doing at Union Church,
[time=253] what you're encouraged about, what's going on in the near future.
[time=257] Tell the folks about that ministry.
[time=259] Thanks, Pastor Kelley.
[time=260] What an honor it is to be here today.
[time=263] It's been quite a ride for a year and a half at Union Church through miraculous circumstances.
[time=268] God brought us there, and we knew that we was going to keep the main thing the main thing.
[time=273] And Jesus said, "My house should be called a house of prayer." And at that particular point in the history of the church, we started praying like never before.
[time=282] And through that prayer, we have seen lives change.
[time=285] That's our mission, to see lives change for Jesus.
[time=288] And we've seen salvation, we've seen marriages put back together.
[time=293] And we are so excited to be able to share in God's work there at Huntington.
[time=299] We're also excited about November 13th.
[time=303] We will be celebrating 135 years of our history.
[time=307] What a wonderful foundation has been laid.
[time=309] And I've asked Pastor Kelley to come and to share what God has laid on his heart.
[time=314] And I am excited about what God's going to do on November 13th.
[time=318] What an absolute honor it was for me.
[time=321] I was so thankful that Jeff and the family there at Union Church was willing and ready to have me come.
[time=328] And I will be there.
[time=330] As you're watching this broadcast, that will be next week, the 13th.
[time=333] And Jeff and I were talking today, it would just be so encouraging for us.
[time=338] If maybe some of you, again, who are looking for a church home or maybe you live out in that Huntington area, we would love for you to come and join us that morning.
[time=346] 10 o'clock is when that service begins at Union Church.
[time=351] You've seen here on the screen as we've been talking some information about the church you can call and get any information that you might need.
[time=358] And again, I am so grateful for this relationship.
[time=361] So thankful that we can partner together in what God is doing here in this community.
[time=367] So I hope you'll come and join us.
[time=369] I also want to encourage you as it relates to today's broadcast.
[time=372] What you're about to see is a very special Sunday.
[time=376] We even titled BCS Sunday.
[time=378] We do it once a year.
[time=379] It's a Sunday where we allow Black Hawk Christian School to just kind of take the morning and bring to our people and you and the Bible, our audience a look in to this amazing ministry that God has had here for over 25 years.
[time=392] Black Hawk Christian School is ministering to hundreds and hundreds of kids and their families and under the leadership of Dr. Sam Barfel, who you'll hear preaching this morning.
[time=403] God is doing some really encouraging things in the hearts and lives of many, many of our students.
[time=409] You'll hear our faculty choir.
[time=411] You'll see kids leading worship.
[time=413] It's going to be a great broadcast.
[time=415] And I hope that God will as he often does speak to your heart and encourage you as you join us this morning.
[time=420] Thanks so much for tuning in.
[time=422] We love you.
[time=423] God bless you.
[time=424] Have a great week.
[time=425] [MUSIC - 190 seconds]
[time=629] Good morning.
[time=630] My name is Sam Barfel and I have the absolute joy and privilege and honor of serving as the Superintendent of Blackout Christian School.
[time=636] And I just want to take a moment to just express my appreciation to Kelly and the Church for allowing one Sunday a year to highlight the Ministry of Blackout Christian School.
[time=644] You know, Blackout Ministries is comprised of many, many varied kinds of ministries.
[time=649] From the Bible hour to children's ministries of student ministries to Awana to the electives to just all of the things that happen here at Blackhawk.
[time=657] And we just feel honored to be able to highlight the Ministry of the School occasionally.
[time=661] Thanks so much for being here.
[time=663] I know there are some visitors and some guests here of some Blackout Christian School students who normally worship somewhere else and maybe today came to be a part of this special day.
[time=672] And I want to say thank you and welcome.
[time=674] Do you know that of the student body at Blackout Christian School, 740 students, about almost 40% of the students attend Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=682] That's their home church.
[time=683] So approximately 60 plus percent attend churches elsewhere in the city.
[time=688] We think that's really a sign of strength and health.
[time=691] Matter of fact, the faculty that you saw sing just a few moments ago, about 65 of those people.
[time=696] And they are kind of a cross section too of the Blackhawk Christian student body. Almost 50% of them attend here and worship here and make this their church home and a good portion of them worship elsewhere.
[time=707] And again, we see that as a sign of strength and health.
[time=710] When we did our first Blackhawk Christian School Sunday about a year ago, we did a little presentation called Blackhawk Christian School by the Numbers.
[time=717] And we kind of did a statistical overview of the school.
[time=719] We're not going to do that today.
[time=720] But I thought it would be appropriate to just explain a little bit of a historical vignette of a sneak peek way back in 1972, the first year of Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=731] And here's how the story goes.
[time=733] A guy named Dr. David Jeremiah was the senior pastor of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=739] And the vision back then, even in the late 60s, early 70s was to have a church with a Christian school and the Bible hour television ministry as well.
[time=748] And so even the original buildings that were built in the North Campus across the street were built with a school in mind.
[time=754] They were built to house, obviously a church and a school.
[time=758] And so early in the 70s, I think it was 1972 was our first year.
[time=762] Dr. Jeremiah knew he needed to have a good school. He needed to get good educators, people who were qualified and professional and competent.
[time=769] So he called on two ladies and their names are Aida Tofolo and Happy Waltz.
[time=774] And we went back to the scrapbooks of the first year of Blackhawk Christian School and resurrected some old pictures of Happy and Aida.
[time=783] And I want to show those to you now. This is Aida right here, 1972 Aida Tofolo.
[time=789] She was a teacher and principal. I think in that first year there were about 35 or 40 students somewhere in there.
[time=795] And so she served a dual role of teacher and principal. And then her partner, her compadre, Happy.
[time=803] She also was a teacher. And these two ladies, go ahead to the next slide.
[time=807] These two ladies not only roommates, but they were colleagues right here at all these years.
[time=813] A teacher and principal right here at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=816] I thought it would be appropriate since I revealed what they looked like and how beautiful and astounding they were back in 1972.
[time=822] That you ought to see how beautiful they are today. Happy Aida, would you guys come up here?
[time=826] These two ladies are just pretty incredible ladies.
[time=853] These two ladies have served all these years for the 32 year history of Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=859] They've been here, plugged in and involved. Today, Happy has hung up her teacher, erasers.
[time=866] And she serves as the assistant elementary principal with Larry Wilhite, who's our elementary principal, and she's his assistant.
[time=872] Aida retired about five years ago, but she's here almost every day volunteering for something and doing some sort of volunteer work.
[time=881] And if I did my math right ladies, between the two of you are about 64 years of service right here at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=889] Here's another interesting part of the story, and that is about three years ago when it was announced that Steve Longbrake, who was a superintendent for 24 years before me, announced that he was kind of moving on to a new passion and a new area of responsibility.
[time=902] And it was announced that I was the new guy. I want to tell you, here's what happened.
[time=906] These two ladies were like, who is this new guy? We got to go check him out.
[time=911] So they left Fort Wayne and drove to Anderson, Indiana to visit me an entire day and see my former school back in Anderson.
[time=919] And this is a picture of us on that day when they came to visit me at my former school.
[time=924] And I've often wondered ladies, I'm assuming I passed.
[time=928] I'm thinking if I didn't pass, I probably wouldn't be here, right?
[time=935] Up, ladies. Thanks, Ayita.
[time=938] Hey ladies, let's give them another round of applause from our appreciation.
[time=942] Love you.
[time=942] Love you, Ayita.
[time=944] [APPLAUSE]
[time=948] The faculty of Blackhawk Christian School is made up of people just like Happy in Ayita.
[time=957] Again, you saw those 65 people up there who make up the faculty, the staff, the clerical staff, the administrative support.
[time=964] All the people that go into making a school a great place to be.
[time=970] And it is just my high honor to work with such a fine group of people and over these two years, now in my third year,
[time=977] I have just really fallen in love with that group of people and enjoy coming to work every day to spend my time with my colleagues
[time=984] and to spend time with the great students at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=987] Have you noticed they're kind of sitting up front? You see them kind of around up front?
[time=991] And I asked them to do that just to be an encouragement to me, so I really appreciate you guys doing that today.
[time=996] And would you take your Bibles and turn to 1 Peter chapter 1?
[time=1000] I am so excited to share what's on my heart today concerning the mind of faith.
[time=1005] I want to tell you a little bit of a journey that I went through in the journey that we went through as a school
[time=1011] in declaring our theme for this school year, 2005, 2006 school year.
[time=1017] We've decided our theme for the year is mind's prepared for action hearts choosing self-control.
[time=1023] If you walk through any part of the building in North Campus or South Campus, you'll see those posters all around.
[time=1027] And that is our theme for the year taken from 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 13.
[time=1032] And about a year and a half ago when Kelly and Mitch and Steve, our teaching pastors opened up a new series,
[time=1039] a new study on the book of 1 Peter, it was about a year and a half ago when we covered this passage.
[time=1044] And as an educator, I have to tell you that my passion is education.
[time=1049] And I love the process of school and seeing young people, young hearts and minds being trained and nurtured
[time=1058] both with knowledge and with scriptural knowledge.
[time=1062] And so as an educator, when I come across something in scripture that speaks of learning or teaching or reason
[time=1070] or are thinking or the mind, it captures my attention.
[time=1074] And I want to know what is Peter saying here when he says in 1 Peter 1 verse 13,
[time=1080] "Therefore prepare your minds for action, be self-controlled, set your hope fully on the grace to be given you
[time=1090] when Jesus Christ is revealed." And so when Kelly preached on that a year and a half or so ago, I just decided I'm going to study that passage.
[time=1099] I want to wrench out of that passage everything that Peter was thinking about and implying when he said prepare your minds for action.
[time=1109] You know, he didn't say prepare your bodies for action and he didn't say prepare your soul for action,
[time=1115] although those are important to be prepared as well.
[time=1118] What he's highlighting here is the fact that it's important to prepare our mind.
[time=1123] So the first thing I did, I wanted to know what is Peter talking about when he uses the word mind?
[time=1129] And as you know, the New Testament, the original language that it was written in was Greek.
[time=1134] And so if you go back to the Greek lexicon and look at the original language, you get a meaning of what he was speaking of when he said the mind.
[time=1145] The Greek word is de anoia and it's not the human brain, it's not that organic gray matter between our ears.
[time=1153] Peter is not saying prepare your brain for action, he's saying prepare your mind, de anoia, which means it's the sum total of the function of our brain,
[time=1164] which gives us the ability to understand, to feel, and even further than that, it's a way of thinking or a pattern of thinking.
[time=1173] So mind in Scripture, and we're going to look at three passages today that speak of the mind in the role of faith and the role of our Christian life.
[time=1184] And in all three of those passages, it's this concept, de anoia, which refers to our ability to understand, to feel, a way of thinking or a pattern of thinking.
[time=1195] It's both perceiving and understanding. It's more than just intellectual capacity or intellectual ability, it's the ability to understand, think, to process information, to perceive.
[time=1206] And then even more importantly, it speaks of a mode of thinking or a pattern of thinking that ultimately guides and directs our behavior.
[time=1214] Here's an illustration of what the mind is. How many of you have a computer or a PDA? Raise your hand.
[time=1220] If you've got a desktop computer or a laptop or a PDA, that thing has in it something called a microprocessor.
[time=1227] And that's the physical piece of equipment that serves a function.
[time=1234] And the function of that is the ability for your computer to do high-level processing to actually compute.
[time=1241] So the microprocessor is like the brain, and what it ultimately produces is the ability to compute.
[time=1247] And it's just like that with this concept of de anoia. The mind in Scripture is our ability.
[time=1252] It's not the brain, it's our ability to understand, to reason, to think. It's a process or a pattern of thinking that leads to a behavior.
[time=1259] So here's why that is important. Thinking about the mind in relationship to our faith and our Christian life.
[time=1267] Here's why it's important. It's important because, well, our heart is part of that as well.
[time=1273] We often speak of our relationship with the Lord. We use the term our heart.
[time=1278] Matter of fact, if you were a little child, I remember leading my children to the Lord and talking that through with Him
[time=1284] and praying with them and helping them understand that process.
[time=1287] And we even use the imagery of asking Jesus into your heart, your innermost being.
[time=1293] The heart in our spiritual life is important. Our soul in our spiritual life is important.
[time=1298] But so is our mind. And Peter speaks to that and the New Testament writers speak to that and it's important.
[time=1306] And here is why it's important because the habits of the mind, the pattern of thinking, the process of thinking,
[time=1313] the habits that we get into in our mind and our thinking ultimately become the passions of our heart.
[time=1322] The habits of our minds become ultimately the passions of our heart.
[time=1328] Let me illustrate that. My son and I, we love to hunt.
[time=1332] And, you know, October 1st opened up the whitetail season.
[time=1335] And so my son and I have studied the whitetail deer.
[time=1338] We have read every article we can get our hands on.
[time=1342] And we have learned everything that we can learn about the whitetail deer of how they habitate and when they move and how they feed
[time=1350] and all that, we've studied that and over time the pattern of the habits of our mind have become the passion of our heart.
[time=1359] We are today passionate about whitetail hunting yesterday morning.
[time=1363] We got up on a Saturday morning at four o'clock. You have to be passionate to get up at four o'clock on a Saturday morning.
[time=1369] But it's because the habits of my mind concerning that became a passion.
[time=1375] And that's true in every area of life. That's why it's so critically vitally important that we develop sound thinking concerning our faith and the truth of Scripture.
[time=1385] Because ultimately the habit of our minds becomes the passions of our heart.
[time=1393] So let's go now to 1 Peter 1.13 and look there again.
[time=1398] "Therefore prepare your minds for action. Be self-controlled. Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed."
[time=1405] I wanted to know what does it mean to prepare your minds?
[time=1408] That word in the Greek prepare is actually, and it, let me see if I can get this right, and it's onumi.
[time=1413] And it's onumi brought up in the Greek culture an image, a picture that was very common to them.
[time=1421] You know, in the Eastern culture they were the tunics or the long robes all the way to the feet.
[time=1426] And so when it's time to run or it's time to work or engage in some sort of action or activity,
[time=1432] it's cumbersome to have all that material around your feet.
[time=1435] So they gird it up. They prepared. They ended no zumi.
[time=1439] And they literally went down and pulled up their robes and put a belt around their waist and they girded up their robes so that they could be prepared for action.
[time=1449] That is the picture of prepared.
[time=1452] We are called upon by Peter to prepare our mind to gird up our minds.
[time=1456] That is literally to tie up, to cinch with a rope, or tie something down for some future activity.
[time=1464] And it's onumi. Prepare. Gird up.
[time=1468] We are to gird up our mind. And what are we to gird up our mind for?
[time=1473] We're to gird it up and to prepare it and to cinch that rope and to get ready for action.
[time=1478] And what is the action? Look at the following verses in 1 Peter 1 there.
[time=1484] Prepare your minds for action.
[time=1486] Be self-controlled. Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you as obedient children.
[time=1489] Do not conform to the evil desires you have when you live in ignorance.
[time=1493] But just as he who called you as holy, so be holy in all you do, for it is written, be holy because I am holy.
[time=1501] We're to gird up our minds and get prepared our minds to do what?
[time=1506] To live a holy life.
[time=1510] Now don't confuse this right here. This is important.
[time=1513] Our salvation comes first, placing our faith in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1518] That is the foundation to preparing our minds.
[time=1521] And then after that happens, God asks us to do something very specific.
[time=1525] Prepare our minds for holy living.
[time=1529] Matter of fact, in studying this passage here, 1 Peter 1, 13 through 14, it occurred to me that the main point of this passage is not necessarily preparing our minds and being self-controlled and living a holy life.
[time=1544] The main idea of this passage is actually in the middle there when he says, set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.
[time=1556] And so in Scripture, the word hope is not like, "Oh, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope I don't get that speeding ticket." Just a couple weeks ago, I saw the red lights in my rearview mirror, and my heart began to pound, and immediately I was thinking, "Oh, I hope, I hope he doesn't give me a ticket." He did.
[time=1574] But I was hoping that he wouldn't. It's not that kind of a hope.
[time=1578] Hope in Scripture is something very different than I'm hoping for the best.
[time=1583] I hope in some crazy way that he doesn't give me a ticket.
[time=1586] No, it's different than that.
[time=1588] Hope in Scripture is our attitude as believers towards future things.
[time=1594] In its purest form, in its most basic essence, biblical hope is faith.
[time=1602] But here's the difference between faith and hope.
[time=1605] Faith in Scripture is believing God today.
[time=1609] That what he said is true today, that what he said he did in the past is true and real.
[time=1616] That's faith.
[time=1618] But biblical hope then is a belief that what God said he will do in the future he will do,
[time=1625] specifically in relationship to the coming of Jesus Christ, the second coming, and are being caught up in the clouds with Jesus if we're here, and if not the eternal resurrection of our soul and our eternal state in heaven, that is our biblical hope.
[time=1639] Our biblical hope is a faith in a future event, a future faith.
[time=1645] That's biblical hope, and that's the point of the Scripture.
[time=1648] But he says to have that hope, to fix your hope, or to set your hope on that future event,
[time=1654] he said this, prepare your minds for action, be self-controlled, live a holy life.
[time=1663] So the sum total of the text is simply this, prepare your mind for action, gird up your mind for action, pull up the loose ends of your life, cinch them together, tie it together, discipline your thoughts, live according to the Bible and its precepts and its principles, disentangle yourself from sinful and carnal and fleshly desires, conduct a holy, righteous, godly life all in view of the future grace
[time=1690] and the future mercy that's going to be bestowed on us through the coming of Jesus Christ.
[time=1695] And that is awesome, isn't it?
[time=1697] Our hope is in what's to come.
[time=1701] And Jesus coming again and our eternal state in heaven if we have a relationship with him.
[time=1707] So prepare your minds for action, be self-controlled, set your hope on that future event of Christ's return.
[time=1718] You might be asking, well, how do I prepare my mind?
[time=1720] How do I gird up my mind then for action?
[time=1722] And you know what?
[time=1723] Let me suggest just three simple ways to gird up your mind for action.
[time=1726] I think it's implied in this text.
[time=1728] The first one is know the living word.
[time=1731] You know, Jesus Christ is referred in Scripture as the living word.
[time=1735] He is the full expression of God the Father as he sent his son to live on this earth for 33 years
[time=1741] and to die at the horrible death at the hands of the Romans and then be resurrected.
[time=1747] That is the full expression of the living word.
[time=1750] Do you know the living word today?
[time=1752] Do you have a faith relationship with God through his son, Jesus Christ?
[time=1756] If not, I encourage you, make that decision today.
[time=1759] Settle that once and for all so that you know what your future hope is and you have that faith for the events to come.
[time=1766] So the first thing, how do I prepare?
[time=1768] Know the living word.
[time=1770] Secondly, know the written word.
[time=1773] Here it is, right here, the whole council of God, everything that we need for life and for godliness, right here.
[time=1781] And let me ask you this question.
[time=1783] What are you doing to know the living word and the written word?
[time=1789] Do you spend time every day in Bible study and in prayer?
[time=1792] Do you take full advantage of all the opportunities in this church or in your church if you're visiting?
[time=1798] Just in this church alone, just off the top of my head, I can think of many opportunities that there are for us to prepare our minds with the truth of God's Word.
[time=1807] Our ABF program, our electives on Sunday mornings.
[time=1811] Awana, student ministries, youth ministries, children's ministries.
[time=1815] Maybe you're in a Bible study in someone's living room and there you're preparing your mind for action with the truth of God's Word.
[time=1823] Or perhaps you listen to preaching and teaching, Bible preaching and teaching on the radio, or you read good books, good spiritual, Christian, godly books.
[time=1832] Those are all ways to know the written word.
[time=1836] But let me give you the third one, not only to know the living word and know the written word, but also want to encourage you to develop the personal spiritual discipline of daily time in God's Word.
[time=1849] You know, I have a good friend whose name is Tom Cashin.
[time=1852] Tom and I have just hit off a neat friendship in the last couple years that I've been here two and a half years or so now.
[time=1858] And Tom is a teacher in public school in the Northwest Allen system.
[time=1863] And Tom has an incredible ministry as a teacher in a public school.
[time=1867] I just love hanging out with Tom Cashin because I get to hear about all the ministry he's engaged in there in the public schools.
[time=1873] And we need great Christian educators in our public school systems.
[time=1878] And Tom is the epitome of that.
[time=1880] I've learned to love him and grown to admire him over the time I've known him.
[time=1884] Tom and I lead a Bible study of young men.
[time=1887] Matter of fact, there are 16 of them.
[time=1889] I'm going to read you their names because I want to tell you something about these guys.
[time=1891] Here they are, these 16 guys that meet every Monday night, no matter if they've got studies or athletics or all the other things that teenagers are engaged in in their busy world.
[time=1900] These 16 guys meet on Monday nights with Tom and I.
[time=1903] John Wessel, Josh Summer, Andrew Nelson, Richard Barfeld, Joe Fouts, Luke Johnson, Joel Burdles, Michael Cashin, Matt Campara, Matt Childers, Chris Bello, Scott McGee, Ryan Winkler, Nick Carter, Adam Birch, Jared Teter.
[time=1916] Just reading their names, a smile comes across my face because I love the guys so much and I've learned to know them this year.
[time=1922] But the reason I tell you about these guys, we call ourselves brothers keepers.
[time=1926] We're holding each other accountable.
[time=1928] You know, there hardly is a day that goes by that one of those 16 guys, and not all of them go to our school, there are three high schools represented.
[time=1934] Hardly a day goes by that one of those guys that attend here doesn't come up to me and say, "Dr. Barfeld, have you had your devotions today?"
[time=1941] Yeah, or not yet, but I will.
[time=1946] And then I get the opportunity to ask them the very same question.
[time=1949] And the reason for that is our heartbeat is we want to teach these young men and all of the students, whether they be at this school or other schools, the personal spiritual discipline of daily time in God's Word.
[time=1962] Our time in God's Word is like breathing. If you don't fill your lungs with God's Word, you're going to run out of air and suffocate.
[time=1972] And I just want to encourage to develop the personal discipline of daily Bible reading.
[time=1978] And I've been so encouraged to watch these young men who are now seniors developing that habit as one of their personal disciplines.
[time=1985] Well, the mind of faith is first of all prepared.
[time=1990] Second of all, the mind of faith is also transformed.
[time=1995] Would you take your copy of the Scriptures and turn to Romans 12, again, a very familiar passage of Scripture.
[time=2002] Romans 12 verses 1 through 3.
[time=2006] It says this, "Therefore, Paul is writing to the Christians, the believers at the Church of Rome.
[time=2013] In the first 11 chapters of this book, he has spent the entire time talking about God's grace and God's mercy.
[time=2020] And so now this is the hinge of this chapter of this book.
[time=2024] This chapter is the hinge of the book.
[time=2025] And he says, "Therefore, because of all I just taught you about God's grace and God's mercy, I urge you, my brothers and sisters in Christ, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices,
[time=2035] holy and pleasing to God, this is your spiritual act of worship.
[time=2039] Present your bodies." That's our physical bodies.
[time=2041] But then he said this, "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by what?
[time=2049] Say it with me, the renewing of your mind.
[time=2054] Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is, his good, his pleasing and perfect will.
[time=2062] For by the grace given me, I say to every one of you, do not think of yourself more highly than you all, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you."
[time=2072] And in this passage, there are two key words I want to look at today.
[time=2076] "Do not be conformed, but be transformed." So let's look at those two words, "conform and transform." Don't be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=2089] What does the word conform mean?
[time=2092] Let me just illustrate exactly what it means.
[time=2094] This is just a lump of clay right here.
[time=2096] And I can take this lump of clay and I can conform it to take on the likeness of anything I choose.
[time=2105] But let me illustrate that a little bit further.
[time=2108] When I was in eighth grade, I can remember in art class in eighth grade.
[time=2111] Given an assignment to take a piece of clay, the kind where you shape it and form it, and then you put this glaze on it, goes in the kill, and then it turns into a piece of ceramic.
[time=2118] And our job was to take a lump, a hunk of clay, and fashion a person's head.
[time=2125] And so I got busy on that thing and I spent a couple of class periods, and I conformed that piece of clay into the shape of an old man's head.
[time=2135] And I got the nose on there, and then I got the mouth gone, and I put the ears on.
[time=2140] And this old man that I made was bald, but he had this little strip of hair around, and I had all that on there.
[time=2146] And then we covered it with this chemical, put it in the oven, and boom, there was my old man.
[time=2152] Well, it was conformed.
[time=2154] It was not an old man, but it took on the image and the likeness of an old man because it was fashioned and took on that image because of external pressure.
[time=2166] Let me give you another illustration of what conform means in Scripture.
[time=2171] This illustration is from our home. My son Richard is a senior this year, and I can remember when he was quite a bit younger, he loved to imitate things.
[time=2180] And to this day, he's a great imitator. He could be an impersonator, I think.
[time=2184] But I remember the day we first watched Indiana Jones.
[time=2187] I think it was the last one of the three. Harrison Ford and, you know, Indy Jones that whole thing.
[time=2192] And we watched this movie together, and Indy Jones wore the big brim hat, and he had this leather satchel that he put across here with a belt and had this leather satchel over here.
[time=2200] And then he had this whip that he used, and he rolled it up and put it in his belt and had that rolled up here.
[time=2206] And we watched that adventure and enjoyed it. And then the movie ended, and here's what my son did.
[time=2211] Five years old, he jumps up out of his seat and disappeared into his room, and I heard the rummaging in something was going on his room.
[time=2216] I didn't know what he was doing. And two minutes later, out he comes, and guess what, he had taken on the likeness of Indy Jones.
[time=2224] He had the big brim hat. He found something to put across here and had a little deal and found a piece of rope and wound it up and stuck it on his belt.
[time=2231] And he was Indy Jones, but only in his mind. He had taken on the likeness. He had conformed to that likeness or that image.
[time=2239] And that's what conformed is in the Bible.
[time=2243] We're not, in this passage, we've been commanded not to take on the image, not to be conformed to the image of the world.
[time=2251] It's a command. It's an imperative. Do not be conformed to the image of the world.
[time=2258] Here's what I found this quote this week. Ken West says this, "Stop assuming an outward expression which is patterned after this world.
[time=2267] It's an expression which does not come from nor is represented of what you are in your inner being as a regenerated child of God.
[time=2276] Don't be conformed to the image of the world. The world in this passage literally means age. It's not the planet. It's not the cosmos.
[time=2283] It means the age that we live in. Let me show you this first. You don't need to turn it, but you'll see it on the screen.
[time=2288] 2 Corinthians 4-4 says this, "The God of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God."
[time=2299] The same word translated "world" in this passage in Romans is the same one translated "age" in 2 Corinthians 4-4.
[time=2307] The God of this age, Satan is the God of this age. And the world's system, everything the world believes, its opinions, its judgments, its thoughts, its aspirations, its hopes apart from God is part of the age that Satan is the God of small g.
[time=2324] And our command is not to take on that image. That's not who we are. We are a new creation and we are not to take on the image of a fallen world.
[time=2335] Listen, here's what happens in the conforming process. It happens to us. We take on that image of the world without any effort.
[time=2349] Here's why. When left to ourself and our fallen nature in the surroundings, in the age of this world and all that stands against God, we just naturally become like our surroundings unless we're a discerning believer who take God's word seriously that we will not be conformed to that image.
[time=2369] Or if we're not in spiritual slumber, so many times believers become undissearning and are in spiritual slumber that they don't even recognize that they're taking on the image of the world.
[time=2382] Well, do not be conformed to this image. Elsewhere in Scripture, Paul also uses conform in a positive way. He said this in Romans 8.29, those whom God foreknew, he also predestined, to be what, conformed to the image of the likeness of God's Son.
[time=2401] So in that passage, that is the positive side of it. We're to take on the likeness of Jesus Christ. Don't take on the likeness of the image of the world. Instead, take on the likeness of Jesus Christ.
[time=2413] We're not Jesus Christ, but we take on his character and his image and his nature.
[time=2419] Well, the next word is transform. Do not be conformed, but instead be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=2429] Transform literally means to change into something new, and it's an internal change that has an outward expression, to change into something new.
[time=2438] In the Greek, it's literally the word metamorpho, which we get, the word metamorphosis. And if you're a student and you remember your days in school, the first thing you think of when you think of metamorphosis from science class is what?
[time=2451] The caterpillar turning into a beautiful butterfly. That is a metamorphosis. That's an internal DNA change that from the inside, that calipiter really is a butterfly, and it comes out with an outward expression of a beautiful butterfly, and that's the word transform.
[time=2465] Jesus was transfigured or transformed on the Mount of Olives. He went through what the Scripture calls a transfiguration.
[time=2473] In other words, for a brief time and to a certain degree, his godly nature came out from inside and was made evident, or at least partially evident there, the transfiguration, and three of his disciples was able to witness that.
[time=2485] I want to illustrate transformation one more way. Come up here, Samuel. This is Sam. Sam Kennedy is a fine student at Black Hawk Christian School. Hi, Sam. How you doing, buddy? You're looking good today. You got the right shirt on too, I see.
[time=2499] What are you holding in your hand? That thing is called a transformer, and so right now, what it is is a tank with this huge cannon. Can you see that? That is an awesome toy.
[time=2511] I remember these transformer toys. They're pretty cool, but there it is. It's a huge tank. Now, Sam, would you demonstrate to us how that thing transforms into something else?
[time=2522] Now, Sam is quite talented and gifted here, and he can transform this thing. He's been practicing a little bit, and he's going to turn that tank into something completely new and different.
[time=2537] I think we almost got it. There it is. Now, instead of a tank, now what we've got is a robot. Isn't that cool? That's an illustration of transformer, transformed metamorphosis, a change from the inside out. Sam, you're awesome, and by the way, I like your name.
[time=2557] Would you give him Sam a hand? [applause]
[time=2564] Well, you may also be thinking, "Okay, how do I transform my mind? How is my mind renewed, and how does that transformation process take place?"
[time=2574] Can I show you a couple passages of Scripture? Here's how you renew your mind. First of all, Colossians 3, verse 2. Here it is. It's coming.
[time=2588] Colossians 3, 2. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. Remember, the habits of the mind become the passions of the heart.
[time=2600] The next passage is Ephesians 4, 20 through 24. Watch this one.
[time=2606] You, however, did not come to know Christ that way. Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
[time=2615] You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires, and to be made new in what?
[time=2624] Say it with me, the attitudes of your minds. And to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
[time=2633] And then 2 Corinthians 10, 5. We demolish arguments in every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God.
[time=2641] And we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. That's the transformation process.
[time=2649] And can I just say parenthetically here, that's what we get to do 180 days a year for 7 hours a day at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=2657] We get to be involved in the process of and investing ourselves in the process of the transformation and the preparation of the mind.
[time=2665] Training young hearts and young minds to go through this very process.
[time=2670] You know, it's part of what we call our formal Bible curriculum at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=2674] Every student has a Bible class, kindergarten through 12th grade, preschool through 12th grade.
[time=2680] And then there's the other part of the formal Bible education, and that is every academic discipline that is taught is taught from a biblically directed or biblical perspective.
[time=2690] We call it biblical integration.
[time=2692] Every academic discipline is integrated with the truth of God's Word. We're trying to prepare young men and young women who not only know the living Word and know the written Word and have developed personal discipline of Bible study, but they know what they believe and why they believe it.
[time=2709] So when they go off to that college, whether it's a state college or a Christian college, they'll be able to defend and articulate their faith, what they believe and why.
[time=2719] And what a huge privilege it is to be able to do that.
[time=2723] Listen, the transforming process, when we change how we think and what we think, it changes how we live.
[time=2731] And then we affirm or put into practice God's will. Look at the last part of our passage in Romans.
[time=2739] Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=2744] And then, here's the result of that, you will be able to test and approve what God's will is, His good pleasing and perfect will.
[time=2754] Well, remember the habits of the mind become the passions of the heart.
[time=2760] And with a mind of faith, not only is it prepared and transformed, but the mind of faith, thirdly, also loves.
[time=2769] The mind of faith loves. Would you turn with me to Matthew chapter 22?
[time=2775] Or follow along on the screen. But Matthew 22, starting in verse 34, says this.
[time=2782] Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.
[time=2788] One of them, an expert in law, tested him with this question. They were trying to trap and trick Jesus.
[time=2794] He said, teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
[time=2798] And I think Jesus' answer is very, very enlightening.
[time=2802] Jesus replied, love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
[time=2811] This is the first and the greatest commandment.
[time=2814] And the second is like it, love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=2818] All the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments.
[time=2822] Here's what Jesus was saying.
[time=2824] God is so worthy that we're to love him with our entire being, our heart, the sum total of who we are,
[time=2832] the expressions of our emotions and our will, our soul, and even our mind.
[time=2838] That's right. We've been commanded to love God with our mind.
[time=2841] Love, inscripture, agape, that is a verb.
[time=2846] It's based on action. It is an act of our will and our intellect to love.
[time=2852] You know, in our relationships, my relationship with my spouse, it's fun and it's exhilarating and it's romantic.
[time=2858] And all that is great. And I love that part of our relationship.
[time=2862] But that's not what love is.
[time=2864] Love is the fact that I've chosen to love my wife.
[time=2867] And Jen has chosen by her intellect and her mind to love me in light of, in spite of all my shortcomings and weaknesses.
[time=2875] That's what love is.
[time=2877] Love is a fulfillment of the law. It's an act of our will.
[time=2881] And Jesus says love God.
[time=2883] A changed, a prepared and a transformed mind will ultimately love God and love people.
[time=2890] I wanted to tell a story that's real dear to me to kind of illustrate these three points.
[time=2896] The mind of faith is a mind that is prepared, transformed, and loves.
[time=2901] And this story is real dear to me because it is the story of my wife, Jen.
[time=2905] Jen was born back in 1962.
[time=2908] And she was born in a hospital in Manhattan, downtown New York City.
[time=2914] And she was born to a young gal. Her last name was Dela Torres.
[time=2917] We don't even know what her first name was because this young gal was 16 years old and was pregnant out of wedlock.
[time=2923] And this young 16 year old kid gave birth to Jenny Dela Torres.
[time=2928] But there was a Puerto Rican family in this hospital there.
[time=2931] And it was Francisco and Luisa Rodriguez, I'm trying to say it like she would say it.
[time=2936] And they got to know this little gal who just gave birth to Jenny and they did a private adoption.
[time=2942] And then they went back to Puerto Rico where Jen spent the first seven years of her life on an island.
[time=2948] With Francisco and Luisa Rodriguez, Francisco and Luisa were old, older.
[time=2953] They were 53 when they adopted Jen. They had four kids that had all four of them had already been married
[time=2959] and had children of their own and all were living back in the States.
[time=2962] And they took Jen on because they loved her.
[time=2964] And they just felt like they wanted to have another child and so they did this adoption.
[time=2970] But something happened at age five.
[time=2972] Age five, Luisa Rodriguez died. Jen's adopted mom died.
[time=2977] And so Francisco, now about going on 60 years old, continued to raise Jen.
[time=2985] And this is a picture of Jen when she was nine.
[time=2989] Isn't that cute?
[time=2992] You know, there are very few pictures that we have of Jen because of her story.
[time=2996] This is one we only have about three or four pictures of when she was a child.
[time=3000] And, you know, when we pull this picture out, our daughters just tease Jen mercilessly for her hairdo.
[time=3007] But you know what? Think about it. She's being raised by a 60-year-old man who's trying to do his best to love her.
[time=3013] And that's probably about the best hairdo he could conjure up right there.
[time=3017] Well, then something happened at age nine. Francisco died as well.
[time=3022] And so Jen, her adopted mom and dad, are now passed away.
[time=3026] And so Jen can recall the time that all the families sitting around the table and they're trying to figure out who's going to take Jenny. She remembers that conversation.
[time=3035] And it ended up an older brother who lived on Long Island and said, "I'll take her." And off she went to Long Island at age nine.
[time=3041] And from nine to 16 she lived with this older brother who had children her age and older.
[time=3047] But there were problems in this household because this brother had battled alcoholism for years.
[time=3052] And horrible abuse took place in this home. And Jen was the target of that as well as the other kids.
[time=3058] And at age 16 she was so angry and so fed up and so confused she just scrapped it all and left.
[time=3065] Ran away. Ran away. And guess what?
[time=3069] A friend from school said, "Why don't you come and live in my basement?" And for two weeks Jen lived in the basement of this house and the parents didn't even know it.
[time=3077] Well, this kid was a Christian and she gave Jen her first Bible.
[time=3083] And as the story goes another older sister Rachel Rodriguez decided, "Look, I'll take Jen in.
[time=3092] I know there's problems there at the brother's house so I'll take her." So they found her and at age 16 another sister Rachel came and picked up Jen and driving from Long Island through New York City and across the George Washington Bridge into North Jersey where they lived, Rachel Rodriguez shared with Jen for the first time the gospel story. Because a month earlier Rachel herself had trusted Christ
[time=3114] and gotten saved. So Jen is now living with another sister who has children, small children herself.
[time=3121] And it wasn't long through the ministry of a church there in North Jersey.
[time=3126] Jen recognized her need for a savior and placed her full faith and trust in Jesus Christ.
[time=3132] But the story doesn't end there and this is where it gets really neat.
[time=3135] She decided as a 16 year old kid, a 10th grader, "I want to go to a Christian school." And so she enrolled at Hackensack Christian School in North Jersey.
[time=3144] Even got a part-time job to help pay for the tuition.
[time=3147] And there at Hackensack Christian School, Janine Rodriguez met a lady named Eunice Hummus.
[time=3155] Eunice was the English teacher at Hackensack Christian High School.
[time=3159] And this is a picture of Eunice. That's in 1970 something. It's back there.
[time=3165] And Eunice has three sons herself, three boys who are teenagers.
[time=3170] And here was this young kid, this new baby infant Christian sitting in her classroom.
[time=3175] She was obviously struggled, obviously had a lot of baggage.
[time=3178] Matter of fact, she was even behind in her work.
[time=3181] So Eunice said, "I'll tell you what, why don't you come to my house on Saturday mornings and I'll tutor you in English and get you caught up in that grammar thing.
[time=3189] So you can get that credit and get that thing out of the way." And so Saturday mornings, Jan started going over to the Hummus' home.
[time=3194] And Eunice and Harry and their three sons just kind of took her on as their own.
[time=3198] She never lived there, but a unique and special relationship was birthed right there with Jan and Eunice.
[time=3205] And as the story continues, she graduated from high school, and this is her graduation from high school.
[time=3212] There's her senior picture, and then the high school graduation is next.
[time=3215] And Harry and Eunice Hummus, mom and dad Hummus, as they're now known, packed Jan up and put her in their big suburban and drove her off to college.
[time=3222] Sent her money almost every month for spending money, just helped her out and just took her on as their own and just loved her, nurtured her, discipled her, spent time with her.
[time=3232] And that's the process that illustrates what I'm talking about here.
[time=3237] Eunice Hummus began a discipling relationship with Janine Rodriguez back in high school.
[time=3244] And to this day, that relationship still exists.
[time=3246] As a matter of fact, just a year ago, mom and dad Hummus packed all their stuff up from a life in New Jersey
[time=3252] and moved to the great city of Fort Wayne to be with Sam and Jenny.
[time=3256] And that relationship was birthed right there in a Christian school, part of a great church just like this one.
[time=3262] And it illustrates how the mind of faith needs to be prepared and transformed and ultimately loved.
[time=3270] And I saw, I've seen that happen in the life of my wife.
[time=3274] That transforming, that preparation, and how Eunice and Harry and the whole Hummus family just gathered around her
[time=3282] and nurtured her and discipled her so that her mind was changed.
[time=3286] She saw her need for Christ and then it was further prepared, transformed, and ultimately, I get to be the beneficiary of that
[time=3294] because she loves me.
[time=3296] I haven't figured that one out yet, but she has a natural expression and a very loving wife and a loving mom and it all happened because her mind has been prepared, transformed, and ultimately loves.
[time=3309] I've asked the audition choir if they'd come and sing our benediction today and they're on their way up.
[time=3315] While they're on their way up, I just want to say too that one of our teachers, Mr. Darren McCown, who was our secondary vocal instructor,
[time=3322] his father passed away very unexpectedly this week due to a complication from a surgery.
[time=3327] And so Mr. McCown, who was going to be leading the faculty choir and our audition choir, is rightfully with his family today.
[time=3335] And Mitch told me earlier that the song that our faculty choir sang was sung at Tom McCown's funeral, and it was his favorite song.
[time=3345] And I think that is appropriate. Listen now, as our high school choir, audition choir sings our benediction and I'll come in close.
[time=3365] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=3440] Would you stand with me as we dismiss in prayer?
[time=3443] By the way, our high school choir sang that song in Latin, which basically means "I adore you Christ."
[time=3449] And let's do that together. Father, thank you so much for your great grace and mercy.
[time=3453] I thank you for your word and how fresh and relevant it is and how we can open it today and be fed from your word and understand what it is you want us to do and understand who it is you want us to become.
[time=3463] And Lord, I thank you for the ministry of blackout Christian school and the huge opportunity and privilege it is to be a part of the process of the preparation and the transformation of the hearts and minds of hundreds of young men and young women.
[time=3478] Lord, I pray for your blessing on that ministry and the ministry of the school, the ministry of our church and all the ministries where the training of the mind
[time=3487] is paramount and important.
[time=3492] Lord, I pray that as we consider the passages before us today, that we would be so diligent to protect and direct
[time=3502] the habits of our minds knowing that that becomes the passions of our hearts.
[time=3508] And Lord, we want to follow you full and hard.
[time=3513] And we can't do that, Father, if our thinking is not aligned with the truth of your word.
[time=3518] So prepare us, transform us so that we can love you and love people.
[time=3523] And I pray these things in Jesus' strong, strong name. Amen.
