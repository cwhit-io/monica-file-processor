[time=576] (singing in foreign language)
[time=603] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and it is good to be with you again.
[time=608] I'm so thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=610] Let me tell you if I can about what you're about to see as you view our broadcast this week.
[time=616] This all took place last week when we were together, and it was a really special Sunday.
[time=621] You'll have to bear with me at the beginning of the message.
[time=625] I think I get off track a little bit as I just share with the family.
[time=630] About an experience I had recently at a college football game, and I won't say anything else to you.
[time=636] I'll just let you watch it.
[time=638] But I think there's something that we can learn.
[time=641] I really do.
[time=642] I think there's something that we in the church can observe from those
[time=648] who gather together, deeply passionate about something, deeply devoted to something.
[time=656] I think there's some things for us to think about.
[time=658] There may be some things for you and I to learn.
[time=660] As we observe large numbers of people coming together on a Saturday afternoon really, really stirred in their hearts about something that means a great deal to them.
[time=670] And I won't say any more.
[time=671] I'll let you just watch and you can draw your own conclusions.
[time=674] But after I get done with the football illustration, we begin a new series.
[time=679] We begin what's going to be, I think, about a five-week study that begins with this concept of self-examination.
[time=688] You see, I feel like it's time for me and I feel like for the family here at Black Hawk, and maybe for you in our viewing audience, maybe you would agree that it's time periodically.
[time=698] It's a good idea, I think, to just take a little bit of time and really ask yourself some very serious and very honest questions.
[time=707] And we begin this week with this idea of self-examination.
[time=711] God's Word speaks to it in many, many instances.
[time=714] And it's very clear that there is something very healthy about you and I periodically stopping pressing pause, if you will,
[time=723] and really asking ourselves, allowing the Spirit of God and allowing the Word of God and allowing the people of God to ask us very serious, very forthright, very honest, very penetrating questions about the reality of our lives.
[time=739] And I want to just ask you this morning, would you be willing to join us over the next five weeks?
[time=745] Would you be open in your heart and in your spirit to coming together with us on a weekly basis and really asking God, how am I doing?
[time=756] How's my life?
[time=759] And not so much how's my life circumstantially, but what am I doing with my life?
[time=765] What am I doing and with this life that God has given me?
[time=769] Am I using it? Am I investing it?
[time=772] Am I spending my days, my time and my talent and my treasure in such a way as to bring maximum glory and praise and honor to God?
[time=783] And so I want to ask you, how are you doing?
[time=785] I mean really, and would you be willing in the days to come to allow God's Word and the Spirit of God to maybe look inside of you and help you answer that question in a very clear and I think very powerful way.
[time=799] So join us today as we begin this journey of spiritual self-examination as we look at our lives and where we're going and what we're doing and how we're doing it.
[time=811] I hope you'll join us.
[time=812] I'm so thankful that you're here today, and I hope the broadcast is an encouragement to you.
[time=818] And God bless you, have a great week, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=823] Good morning.
[time=824] I'm privileged to be here with you this morning.
[time=827] For those of you who don't know, my husband and I were in family.
[time=831] We're a part of Black Hawk for about seven years, and we recently moved back to North Carolina where we're from.
[time=838] God in his sovereignty, though, allowed us to be able to be here
[time=844] on this weekend.
[time=845] I was able to come and visit Marty and I this weekend, and I was able to be a part of the Black Hawk women's retreat.
[time=854] That was special for me to be able to come and be with the ladies, a lot of my old friends, and God had a message for me this weekend about contentment.
[time=866] Right now we have been looking for a house, looking for a church, and a lot of things in our life are just up in the air, unknowns.
[time=876] And it was good, as it always is, to just be reminded that we,
[time=886] one thing the lady said this weekend that really stuck out in my mind was that we must choose to display God's glory in our circumstances.
[time=894] And that's my prayer as we go back.
[time=897] And again, I'm just privileged and honored to be here today and to sing this song for him, for his glory.
[time=905] [MUSIC] Wonderful Savior, my heart belongs to thee [MUSIC] I will remember always the blood you shed for me [MUSIC] Wonderful Savior, my heart will know you're well [MUSIC] So I will embrace you always as I walk [MUSIC] This side, be blessed, be loved, be lifted high [MUSIC] Be treasured here, be glorified [MUSIC] I owe my life to you, my Lord, here I am [MUSIC] Beautiful Jesus [MUSIC] How may I bless your heart [MUSIC] And these two years I bow down to everything you want [MUSIC] Beautiful Jesus [MUSIC] You are my only word [MUSIC] So let me embrace you always as I walk [MUSIC] This side, be blessed, be loved, be lifted high [MUSIC] Be treasured here, be glorified [MUSIC] I owe my life to you, my Lord, here I am [MUSIC] Be blessed, be loved, be lifted high [MUSIC] Be treasured here, be glorified [MUSIC] I owe my life to you, my Lord, here I am [MUSIC] Here I am, here I am [MUSIC] Here I am, here I am [MUSIC] Be blessed, be loved, be lifted high [MUSIC] Be treasured here, be glorified [MUSIC] I owe my life to you, my Lord, here I am [MUSIC] Here I am, here I am [MUSIC] Here I am, here I am â™ª
[time=1154] Hey, I'm gonna, I'm gonna step out on a limb here this morning.
[time=1158] I did first hour and it held, so I'm figuring I'm okay.
[time=1162] Maybe I'll just step out again here and hopefully it won't break off and I won't crash and burn, but I just, I felt very compelled this morning in light of the last 24 hours of my life and some experiences I was privileged to have.
[time=1178] God just kind of did a work in my, in my brain as I kind of made my way here today
[time=1185] and I'm just gonna try and get some of it out to you this morning and I apologize if it doesn't come out just right or if it's a little rough.
[time=1193] I'm trying to kind of think it through and process it all as we go here, I just felt compelled to share it with you and I hope this won't scare you away, bear with me as I say this, but I want to talk to you about, feel compelled to share with you about the church.
[time=1209] Now strike that, the, the gathering, this, that we get to participate in each and every week.
[time=1217] I want to talk to you a little bit about the gathering where the body of Christ comes together and Notre Dame football.
[time=1227] Bear with me, no, no, easy, this is not a plug, just, just listen, just bear with me here.
[time=1233] I want to talk to you about the gathering and, and college football.
[time=1239] I got to, if you can, I don't know if you can tell from my voice, I went to a football game yesterday.
[time=1243] I had the privilege of going, my best buddy, Jeff, best friend in the whole wide world, he came out and we got to go to the game together with Mitch and Mark Kaufman from our team here and what a great, great day.
[time=1253] And I've been a couple of times, I think my third or fourth time to South Bend.
[time=1257] And I know, I know, it's the same way in Lafayette, it's the same way in Bloomington and Ann Arbor, I know, I know.
[time=1263] But I just, I just got to tell you my experience.
[time=1265] My experiences is that that town is nuts.
[time=1269] Those people are fanatical and what goes on there is absolutely amazing.
[time=1275] And I was just taken back all over again as we pulled into South Bend and began to experience that day.
[time=1282] And some of you have experienced it and maybe some of you haven't, but I just want to make a couple of observations if I can.
[time=1288] And then I want to just engage you in some questions and some thoughts.
[time=1291] So I'm going to try my best, so here we go.
[time=1293] They, those people up there, those people in that town, those people that kind of run the stadium,
[time=1301] those people on campus, the, the 80,000, somebody correct me on my number, somebody who's a Notre Dame.
[time=1307] Is it 80,000 that fit in?
[time=1309] Yeah, thanks Dave.
[time=1311] The 80,000, the 80,000 people that move their way into that stadium, they are, watch this.
[time=1318] Something stirs in their hearts deeply.
[time=1325] And they, my friends, are passionate about something.
[time=1331] And that something is Notre Dame football.
[time=1335] And they are ballistically out of control, passionate and devoted and committed to the green and gold.
[time=1344] And you see it everywhere.
[time=1346] I mean, as soon as you drive into town, these people, their hearts down deep inside, their hearts are stirred.
[time=1351] And they are passionate and they cannot wait to get into that stadium.
[time=1358] And there's things going on though around that even kind of, I think, to it and that express it even more, I mean, the concession stands, you know, are open to hours before the game.
[time=1368] And the people are streaming in and they're, they're celebrating and they're talking and they're laughing.
[time=1375] And they are so, you get the sense.
[time=1377] They are so glad that it is Saturday.
[time=1382] You get a sense of, and they've been anticipating.
[time=1386] And now it's here and they, they are in Nirvana.
[time=1390] It's like, whoa, there's smiles everywhere and there's energy and there's excitement.
[time=1394] Watch this.
[time=1396] The band comes.
[time=1398] I don't know if you've been up there before, but at some point, the band makes its way across campus and into the stadium.
[time=1405] And as soon as the first drum is hit, I'm telling you they just come streaming the people who have come to the event, the gathering.
[time=1413] See, something stirs in their heart.
[time=1416] And they are passionate about Notre Dame football.
[time=1419] And when they hear that band, they know it.
[time=1421] And they come streaming to the stadium and they form a tunnel and the band comes across the campus with all of the people yelling at them and, and high-fiving them
[time=1432] and shouting their, their, their affirmation and their encouragement to them.
[time=1436] And the band yells back and they are all so excited.
[time=1442] So deeply moved about this event that brings them together.
[time=1448] I'm telling you, it's just amazing.
[time=1450] They're passionate in the parking lot.
[time=1454] And they're passionate out on the, on the city streets where people like me end up parking because the parking lots are full.
[time=1462] And so then you start going down little side roads and it's amazing.
[time=1465] We'll side note here, we found a, a family.
[time=1468] I love America.
[time=1469] We find a family with a sign out in front of their house that says parking.
[time=1472] They're charging $30 to park your car in their backyard.
[time=1477] And there's nowhere else to park.
[time=1479] So they got you.
[time=1480] And they got their three kids out there in the front with Notre Dame, Jersey's on big smiles and money belts tied around their waists.
[time=1487] And the kids are standing there at the driveway with the dad behind them going welcome.
[time=1493] And you're, I drove in this driveway, hand it over my 30 bucks.
[time=1497] You kind of go up a little crest and then you come down this hill.
[time=1500] They've got like five acres.
[time=1502] There were 150 cars.
[time=1505] Do the math.
[time=1507] I know one of the dads down at their smile and saying welcome.
[time=1511] These boys are going to go to college.
[time=1516] But they're even happy and they're excited.
[time=1519] And then, and then that time comes.
[time=1523] That time draws near.
[time=1526] It's almost 2 30.
[time=1529] And the energy level just begins to escalate.
[time=1533] And, and then you start making your way into the stadium.
[time=1537] And you come through that tunnel and you give that guy your ticket.
[time=1540] And you walk into that thing and, and whatever energy you were feeling outside,
[time=1546] it just, it just absolutely goes through the ceiling because you're, you're there.
[time=1550] You're inside now.
[time=1551] And you can just, and I'm not really talking about external things that you're necessarily seeing people do.
[time=1555] There's just an energy because something in their hearts is stirred deeply, and they are passionate about being in that place.
[time=1563] And you go and you take here.
[time=1564] We took our seat with a 30 yard line about 50 rows up.
[time=1567] It was perfect.
[time=1568] We could see everything.
[time=1570] We could hear it all.
[time=1571] And then the energy and the momentum begin to build.
[time=1574] And all of a sudden the band comes onto the field and boom.
[time=1577] People go nuts again.
[time=1578] Then the players come onto the field.
[time=1580] Then watch this.
[time=1581] Then we sing God bless America.
[time=1585] And you've just never heard anything like it.
[time=1587] 50,000 people sing in God bless America.
[time=1589] And guess what?
[time=1592] Everybody sang.
[time=1599] Nobody sat with their arms folded and didn't sing.
[time=1604] Everybody sings because they're so passionate and something in their hearts been stirred so deeply.
[time=1610] And at this point it's about their country and it's about Notre Dame football.
[time=1614] They sing and then the Star Spangled Banner.
[time=1616] And then at the crescendo of the Star Spangled Banner from Tara Hote, or Tara Hote as you say here, four F-16s come perfectly timed at the crescendo of the song.
[time=1627] All of a sudden you look up and these four dudes come flying through.
[time=1632] And the places goes nuts and there's this guy two rows behind me.
[time=1636] I look back tears are streaming down in space and he goes, "God, I love this!"
[time=1643] I think he meant it.
[time=1644] I don't think he was cursing.
[time=1645] I don't think he was being inappropriate.
[time=1647] I think in his own raw way he was worshiping.
[time=1651] That was amazing.
[time=1654] And then watch this.
[time=1656] Not only -- oh, this is cool.
[time=1659] Not only is something stirred way down deep in their hearts about Notre Dame football, and not only is there all this energy and anticipation about the event, but most of the 80,000 show up four or five hours, what?
[time=1674] Early so that they can be what?
[time=1678] Together.
[time=1680] They just -- they can't wait until 2.30.
[time=1685] So they pull up RVs and pickup trucks and vans and they unload blankets and chairs and
[time=1692] grills and coolers and a lot of other stuff as well, I realize.
[time=1697] And they are together and they laugh and they tell stories and they -- and they fellowship
[time=1705] and they play catch and they have the TV on and they just bask in this thing called community.
[time=1714] They're all there for a common cause and they are so devoted to it and so committed to it
[time=1720] that they come hours before until they hear the band.
[time=1724] And then they start running because then it's time.
[time=1732] So what's your point?
[time=1734] You're sitting there asking.
[time=1735] So what's your point?
[time=1736] My point is a few of them.
[time=1738] But one thing that just kind of came to my mind driving home is that's all about football.
[time=1749] And please don't take this as sacrilegious.
[time=1754] Please don't.
[time=1755] Know my heart and how I'm saying this.
[time=1757] These are thoughts.
[time=1758] These are things God's helping me think through.
[time=1761] I found myself wishing that our gatherings were like theirs in many respects.
[time=1776] I wish in my own heart I'm not shaking my finger at you.
[time=1781] I wish sometimes that there was that much anticipation in my spirit and my soul.
[time=1786] And it got me thinking, you know, you know when all that starts for them, it is not a switch
[time=1795] that they turn on Saturday morning.
[time=1798] Do you know what all those people are doing right now, today, Sunday?
[time=1803] They're reading the paper about what?
[time=1806] About next week's game.
[time=1808] And all week long they'll read the paper.
[time=1810] And all week long they'll go on the internet.
[time=1812] And all week long they'll talk amongst themselves.
[time=1814] All we see today the anticipation for what they'll get to experience again.
[time=1819] See today it begins all over.
[time=1821] And all week they'll go to work and they'll do the family thing and they'll do go to school.
[time=1826] But they will just long in their hearts to be together again to celebrate this thing that stirs deep in their hearts.
[time=1834] It's not a switch, it's a lifestyle.
[time=1838] It brings them to that gathering full of passion and energy and love and devotion.
[time=1845] I don't think many, I don't think there were many, you know, that slept through it yesterday.
[time=1854] I don't think there were a whole lot that woke up and went, you know what I'll catch the highlights later.
[time=1861] Because it means so much to them.
[time=1867] We'll have had a couple thousand people around here today.
[time=1871] I'm not trying to compare the two to the eighty.
[time=1874] I just happen to believe in my heart that what's in me and what I'm trying to live my life for
[time=1883] and who we're trying to be as a family.
[time=1885] I believe it's so much bigger and so much deeper and so much better than football.
[time=1893] But yet you and I don't, we don't come in here like that.
[time=1902] Many of us didn't wake up last Monday and think, oh my goodness, I cannot wait to be back
[time=1912] in that gathering with those people and get to sing what we sing and share what we share.
[time=1920] Nobody planned a tailgate breakfast party today.
[time=1923] You weren't out there at seven going, man, where are they going to open those doors?
[time=1929] And I'm not really saying you should, although you have my permission to, and if you do please invite me, because I'll bring my football and we'll have a blast.
[time=1940] Am I making any sense?
[time=1942] So I just leave you with this and I'm not trying to be real, real philosophical and deep here, but why isn't it for you?
[time=1952] I just leave you with that. Why?
[time=1955] Why isn't it stirred that deep?
[time=1959] Why isn't there that kind of anticipation and passion?
[time=1964] And it's not a guilt trip.
[time=1965] I'm just asking you to give some thought and I believe it has something to do with a lifestyle.
[time=1969] With a relationship with a living God, and when you and I are giving ourselves to that,
[time=1975] when we're reading the paper, when we're talking about it, when we're on the Internet, when we're getting our hearts and our minds and our souls ready all week long, then I feel like we have
[time=1985] the opportunity to experience together a sense of passion, God honoring energy.
[time=1992] All right, thanks for letting me get that out.
[time=1995] If I didn't offend anybody, more than anything, I hope I encouraged you to give some thought to our times together.
[time=2002] Well, again, thank you for being here this morning and I want to just let you know that I feel
[time=2008] as if in my heart over these last couple of weeks.
[time=2011] I really sense that God is leading us to a time, a season here.
[time=2017] We've got a few weeks until Christmas and I have asked and I have prayed and I have begged God
[time=2023] to give us some direction on what it is we are to study and what it is we are to consider
[time=2029] together in our times here over the next four or five weeks or so and I really believe in my heart that as he often does, as he always is, he has been faithful to kind of nudge me
[time=2040] in a direction and so I'm going to ask you to come with me in this direction over these next few weeks and let me just start by saying this.
[time=2052] I oftentimes walk by people in the hallway here.
[time=2056] I'll oftentimes walk by folks out in public.
[time=2058] You and I will oftentimes walk by people and we will in our typical courteous and that's kind of give a greeting.
[time=2064] Everybody kind of has their own greeting.
[time=2066] We all kind of say it different ways and do it different ways but a lot of times, you know, it kind of comes out what's up or what's happening or how are you or how goes that or how's life.
[time=2076] I mean, we kind of we ask those real quick kind of flippant questions and it's not that we're being disingenuous.
[time=2081] It's not that we're trying to be shallow.
[time=2084] We just we say, you know, how's it going?
[time=2087] And most of the time you and I respond, you know, pretty good, great or okay about you,
[time=2093] great, good, see you later and I'm not saying I'm offended by that.
[time=2098] I participate in those shallow exchanges all the time.
[time=2103] But sometimes, sometimes, and I'm so thankful for this, maybe you are too, sometimes in
[time=2111] our life, we have people who know us, who we trust, who we have a relationship with.
[time=2117] And sometimes somebody will come along and look you and I in the eye and you kind of know
[time=2123] that look and they'll say to you, how, how are you?
[time=2128] And the penetrating probing nature and the genuine nature of the question allows you
[time=2136] to consider and think about this question.
[time=2142] How, how are you?
[time=2146] Really.
[time=2148] So how am I, how am I doing?
[time=2153] And when you start going down that road and when I start going down that road, as I have, I have tried to do on a somewhat regular basis in my life, you begin to realize how very important it is that we would be people, you and I, in relationship with God, who would give ourselves to on a periodic or dare I say regular basis, something that we will call
[time=2174] for the sake of this discussion in the weeks to come, spiritual self-examination.
[time=2184] Self-examination, spiritual self-assessment.
[time=2189] In all of life, in all that God has brought my way, in all that's going on, in all that
[time=2196] He has put before me, how really, really am I doing?
[time=2203] First Corinthians 1128, would you open your Bibles there?
[time=2207] Let me just show you a couple places where we see this idea and this concept, this truth,
[time=2213] and not only is it a principle, my friends, but it's something that God's word calls you and I to participate in on a regular basis, spiritual self-examination.
[time=2224] How are you?
[time=2226] Really.
[time=2228] In all of your life, 1 Corinthians 1128, oftentimes when we gather for communion you'll hear us,
[time=2235] you'll hear me or another pastor reference this.
[time=2237] This is a very important passage of Scripture.
[time=2240] It says in 1 Corinthians 1127, "Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord
[time=2247] in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord."
[time=2253] Now look at 28, "But a man must, if you don't want to be guilty of the body and blood of
[time=2259] the Lord," in other words, if you caught the gist there in verse 27, you can approach the
[time=2268] table, the bread and the cup in a way that's very, very dangerous, that brings with it consequences.
[time=2277] And he goes on to say here, "What's dangerous about it is if you don't examine yourself."
[time=2284] Look at verse 28, "But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the
[time=2291] bread and drink of the cup." Spiritual self-examination.
[time=2296] Hey, I don't want to be graphic here.
[time=2298] I'm not trying to be funny.
[time=2299] I'm not trying to be too graphic, but just bear with me on this one, okay?
[time=2302] I'd like you to think about, because I want you to kind of have this picture in your mind's eye.
[time=2306] I'd like you to think about an exam.
[time=2310] I would like you to think about an examination.
[time=2313] I'd like you just to allow yourself to think about the old family practitioner and the yearly trip, and maybe it's your kids, or maybe it's you, but I just want you to think about the way the exam goes.
[time=2326] And it's a very, very healthy picture, and it helps us understand this concept, because you see, when you and I go in, and we sit on the paper, on the table with the paper, that it just wrinkles really bad when you sit on it.
[time=2338] It always bugs me, but I'm weird.
[time=2340] I know.
[time=2341] You sit on that paper, and the doctor comes in.
[time=2344] You just think about what goes on there.
[time=2345] There is a visual thing that happens.
[time=2348] You see, he or she, they look at you, and they observe you, and they look at all of you.
[time=2356] Head to toe, they make a physical kind of visual assessment.
[time=2361] They look at you.
[time=2362] They also have found all kinds of ways, and we won't go into it, to look into you.
[time=2369] Right?
[time=2370] They look inside you, and they don't just look inside you in a few places.
[time=2377] They go ahead and just look inside you where?
[time=2380] Everywhere, because they don't want to miss, what?
[time=2384] They don't want to miss anything.
[time=2386] They look at you.
[time=2389] They take pictures of you that show all kinds of things.
[time=2394] They take that cold little thing and stick it on your back so that they can what?
[time=2399] Listen to you.
[time=2401] They look at you.
[time=2403] They take pictures of you.
[time=2404] They listen to you.
[time=2405] They examine you.
[time=2409] All of you, because your health, your health is on the line, and they want to be able to
[time=2416] be good physicians, but to do that, to be healthy requires a thorough exam.
[time=2424] Look at 2 Corinthians 13-5, just one more book over.
[time=2427] If you don't have a Bible, just maybe look on with somebody.
[time=2430] 2 Corinthians 13-5.
[time=2435] It says, "Test yourselves," slightly different word in the Greek, but bear with me.
[time=2445] "Test yourselves," Paul says to the church at Corinth, "to see if you are in the faith." Here it is.
[time=2451] "Examine yourselves, or do you not recognize this about yourselves that Jesus Christ is
[time=2458] in you unless indeed you fail the test."
[time=2464] Examine yourselves.
[time=2468] Back in 1 Corinthians 11, let a man examine himself.
[time=2471] Question for you so far.
[time=2472] Who's doing the testing?
[time=2474] So far as we look at this concept, who is it that God is placing the onus of responsibility upon to do the examining?
[time=2481] Who?
[time=2482] You.
[time=2483] Us.
[time=2484] He says that you and I are to engage in this process.
[time=2488] Look at Galatians.
[time=2489] Go one more book.
[time=2490] Galatians 6 verses 1 to 5.
[time=2502] Brethren, it says there, brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are
[time=2508] spiritual, restore such a one.
[time=2511] In a spirit of gentleness, each one looking to yourself so that you too will not be tempted.
[time=2518] Share one another's burdens and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.
[time=2522] For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself, but each
[time=2528] one must examine his own work.
[time=2531] There it is.
[time=2532] But each one must examine his own work, his work, his work, his spiritual life, his spiritual
[time=2543] ministry, his spiritual activity.
[time=2545] Each one must examine his own home.
[time=2550] Each one must examine his own relationships.
[time=2554] Each one must examine all that he or she is giving himself or herself to.
[time=2560] We must be willing to examine our work and then he will have reason for boasting in regard
[time=2568] to himself alone and not in regard to another for each one in the end.
[time=2575] Right?
[time=2576] We will bear his own load.
[time=2586] Sometimes what I wish I could do, just me being me, wired the way I'm wired and feeling
[time=2593] about you the way I feel about you, loving you like I do and caring for you and your
[time=2599] spiritual lives the way I do.
[time=2602] Sometimes I wish I could just take each and every one of you, find a booth somewhere,
[time=2609] get a cup of coffee or a shantico and sit down and look you in the eye and just ask
[time=2619] you, "How are you?" I mean really.
[time=2626] And I would love it, you know, in this make-believe picture.
[time=2630] I would just absolutely love it if you would, you know, do the same and if I could go with you and have you ask me and me share that, I wish there was a way we could at that level all of us together experience that but I can't do that, you know that and I know that.
[time=2645] So this is for now in this endeavor.
[time=2647] This is Plan B. I'm going to ask you this morning if you would be up for something and
[time=2653] I'm serious.
[time=2654] I'm going to ask each and every one of you if you would be willing to give yourself to Plan B here.
[time=2662] Plan A was you and me at the coffee shop.
[time=2665] Plan B is this, "I'd like to invite you over the next four or five weeks to ask yourself
[time=2675] some very, very and allow me to ask you and allow God's Word to ask you.
[time=2681] I'd like to invite you, each and every one of you, to give yourself to a four or five week process of self-examination."
[time=2692] Here you go, listen, to take all of your life and if you're going to hold back a few
[time=2700] compartments, if you're going to hold back a few areas, if you're going to kind of close off a few sections, then you're out, then you can't do it.
[time=2712] You can listen and maybe you'll get a few things, but what I'm inviting you to is a
[time=2718] four or five week process.
[time=2719] I'm going to ask you to be here.
[time=2721] I'm going to ask you to make plans to be here and to over four or five weeks span, engage
[time=2727] in it and I realize it's a very personal thing.
[time=2730] It'd be better in the booth and I hope, we'll get to that later, I hope you're doing that
[time=2736] in restaurant booths and in living rooms and in board rooms, wherever you meet with those that you love and trust, but we'll get to that.
[time=2743] But we're going to do it publicly in a sense, we're going to do it very privately and I'm going to pray and hope the Word of God and the Spirit of God will move in your heart, but I want to invite you to what is, I know, a very personal thing that we'll just do right
[time=2757] here together as a family in a very personal way.
[time=2761] And there's a couple of reasons, there's about 20 actually, but I just wrote down two this morning that I really feel like this is a time in the life of our family.
[time=2771] Couple things I wrote down that I think speak to why it is so important that you and I would be willing to do this today in this season.
[time=2782] And one of them is, and I'll just have them show it to you here, I'm sure most of you will identify with this, today's pace of life.
[time=2789] Why are we going to take four to five Sundays and do a study and a look at God's Word and
[time=2795] consider this issue of self-examination?
[time=2797] Why over the next four to five weeks would I think it to be so important that you would and I would actually in this setting give ourselves to that kind of discipline?
[time=2807] Well, you know what, if we don't, if we don't do this, if we don't speak to this, if we
[time=2815] don't give ourselves to this discussion, I fear that in many of your lives, maybe it
[time=2823] will never happen, the pace of life.
[time=2827] If I had everybody in this room raise your hands, if I said hey, everybody in this room who on a regular basis, you have carved out time in your day or week and the spiritual
[time=2839] discipline of self-examination is a spiritual discipline that you give yourselves to often.
[time=2847] You understand it and you're practicing it and God is growing and changing you through your regular participation in the spiritual discipline of self-assessment.
[time=2859] And I said, okay, raise your hands.
[time=2860] Everybody who does that on a regular basis, I don't guess a lot of hands would go up.
[time=2870] If I said raise your hand, if in the last 20 minutes your interest has been has been peaked, raise your hand, you know, if as we begin to discuss this, you sense in your soul
[time=2881] before God that this would be something that you would need to and want to give yourself to.
[time=2887] I bet a lot of you would raise your hands and I'll tell you what, if I asked you, well then why, you know, why isn't it happening?
[time=2893] Some might say that you're not even quite sure how to do it.
[time=2898] You maybe could just use some help which we can give you.
[time=2902] But many of us would just have to kind of cower and kind of raise our hands and say, you
[time=2908] know what, I just haven't made the time.
[time=2913] And I want to make sure I say this to you about the pace of life.
[time=2917] The pace today's pace of life.
[time=2920] Even the way I've said that, two reasons why we're going to examine ourselves.
[time=2925] Number one, today's pace of life.
[time=2926] When you see that, you've got to be real careful with that phrase.
[time=2929] It almost can send you into victim mode.
[time=2933] And let me just stand here and lovingly remind every one of you that your pace of life is
[time=2939] the pace that you've chosen.
[time=2943] It's the choice that you've made to live your life that way.
[time=2948] That fast, that scattered, that busy, that overdone, that spread out.
[time=2957] The pace of life is a choice that you and I make based upon the values and the priorities
[time=2963] of our hearts.
[time=2965] And so, I'm not blaming the pace of life.
[time=2968] I'm just putting that up there to help you understand that I really feel like this discussion leads you and I to the very core principles of our lives.
[time=2976] Because when we value and prioritize that which we should and can, then we're freed up to make decisions that are good for us.
[time=2986] But I know you've got a lot of work to do in that arena and so do I.
[time=2989] So we'll do that work.
[time=2990] And in the meantime, I wanted to just make sure that in these four to five weeks we actually jumped into this process and that we jumped in together.
[time=2998] Secondly, personal growth.
[time=3000] Another reason why we are going to examine ourselves over these next few weeks is the opportunity, I believe in my heart it brings to you and I for personal growth.
[time=3010] You know what my friends, I'm not doing well in some areas of my life.
[time=3015] I still need help.
[time=3017] I still need growth.
[time=3019] I still need to understand some things more clearly.
[time=3023] I still need to become more and more of the husband that he's called me to be, the father that he's called me to be, the leader that he's called me to be.
[time=3033] I need this process of self-examination in my life because I desire to be the husband,
[time=3039] the father, the leader that he's called me to be.
[time=3042] And you know what I need you, I need you to be engaged in that same process.
[time=3046] Hey, hey listen, if we're going to prevail, you hear us use that phrase, if we are going
[time=3052] to be the family of God that he has really called us to be and given us the capacity to
[time=3058] be, if we are going to as a family, make a really eternal difference in this world,
[time=3065] in this world that he's given us here, if we are going to as a church, bring great glory and great honor to him.
[time=3072] We have got to be bringing great glory and honor to him personally.
[time=3079] Before we can do that corporately, and you and I, as we read the scriptures, we will begin to see that this self-examination process is a very, very, very vital part of you and
[time=3090] I being who God has called us to be.
[time=3093] Now, let me just say this to you, I think we need some help in doing this.
[time=3103] And I love the scriptures, how they do this.
[time=3105] The scriptures have said clearly in the three passages I've taken you to this morning.
[time=3109] The scriptures have clearly said that the onus of responsibility in the self-examination process is who, you, it says examine yourselves and there's a period.
[time=3121] At the same time, my friends, the balance of God's word and the totality of what he has
[time=3127] given us here makes it clear that while I believe he wants you and I to do that, Jeremiah
[time=3133] 17-9, turn there.
[time=3135] Jeremiah 17-9 says the heart, if you and I are going to move into this process of trying to self-examine ourselves, Jeremiah 17-9 gives us this warning, the heart, look what it says,
[time=3148] the heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick.
[time=3154] Some translations might say wicked.
[time=3157] So if it's just you and me and our hearts and us just trying to do this self-assessment by ourselves, though God has called us to do that, God's word also reminds us that that heart that would be engaged in this self-examining process is desperately sick.
[time=3174] Who can understand it?
[time=3176] Who can assess it?
[time=3178] Who can really look into it on their own?
[time=3180] Look at the next verse, what a great verse, 17-10, "I, the Lord, search the heart.
[time=3189] I test the mind even to give to each man according to his ways, according to the results of
[time=3196] his deeds." I think God's word is very clear, my friends, that on this self-examination journey, you and I desperately need the Spirit of God and the Word of God to guide us in that endeavor.
[time=3212] Why?
[time=3213] Well, think about it.
[time=3215] Think about this.
[time=3217] Listen, we can tend to, I'll speak for myself.
[time=3221] When I'm self-examining me, you know what I can do?
[time=3227] I can tend to justify things.
[time=3232] I can tend to justify my sinful deeds.
[time=3235] I can excuse sinful responses, or I can downplay sinful attitudes and patterns.
[time=3244] We have a way of you and I, we have a way of blaming others.
[time=3251] We have a way of assessing others.
[time=3252] We have a way of examining others, more so than we do ourselves, and I believe we need
[time=3259] His help.
[time=3260] First and, and let me read this to you, Psalm 139, verses 13 and 17.
[time=3268] Psalm 139 verses 13 through 17, 139, what a great passage I would encourage you.
[time=3280] You know what?
[time=3281] If you're willing to take me up on this, if you're willing to really give yourself to a season here of four or five weeks where you would examine all arenas of your life, next week we're going to look at the life of community that God has given you.
[time=3295] How are you, how are you managing, how are you stewarding the relationships in your life?
[time=3302] We're going to just celebrate community and in the process ask you what that looks like
[time=3308] in your life and be what steps you could take to further experience and benefit from the
[time=3314] relationships, the spiritual relationships that God has given you or wants to give you.
[time=3320] Says in Psalm 139, verse 13, "For you form my inward parts.
[time=3327] You wove me in my mother's womb.
[time=3330] I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, wonderful are your works, and my soul knows it very well.
[time=3337] My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the
[time=3343] depths of the earth.
[time=3344] Your eyes have seen my unformed substance, and in your book we're all written the days
[time=3350] that were ordained for me when as yet there was not one of them.
[time=3355] How precious also are your thoughts to me, O God." And look what it says in verse 23, "Search me," the psalmist understood God's examining
[time=3365] power.
[time=3366] "Search me, O God, and know my heart." If you're willing to give yourself to this process in these next few weeks, could you say this?
[time=3374] Would you be willing to just in the privacy and quietness of your own heart, say this to him this morning, "Search me, O God, I'm going to do my part, but will you help me?
[time=3383] Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[time=3386] Try me.
[time=3387] Examine me.
[time=3388] And know my anxious thoughts.
[time=3390] And see if there be any hurtful, sinful, shameful, wicked, ungodly way in me.
[time=3402] And if there is, and lead me in the everlasting way."
[time=3408] I would propose to all of you this morning that there is no one better to help you and I examine ourselves than the great physician, the one who according to Psalm 139 knows you
[time=3419] intimately.
[time=3420] So come back, join us over these next few weeks.
[time=3423] We're going to continue to study this spiritual discipline of self, spiritual self-examination,
[time=3432] and I am so, so looking forward to it.
[time=3436] Join me in a word of prayer, would you?
[time=3438] Father God, we come before you this morning and we pray, many of us, I would guess in the room, maybe willing to embark upon a journey of really assessing our lives, all of our
[time=3451] lives, God.
[time=3453] And I pray that for the mother and the father, I pray that for the business man or woman, I pray God for the old and for the younger ones, for those in the middle of the road, God, I pray for those that have known you for years, and I pray God that for those new on this journey of faith, I pray for everybody in this room that knows you, that as they would
[time=3473] give themselves to this process of self-examination, and as they would open up their hearts and lives to your probing power, God, I pray that you would change us, I pray that you would
[time=3485] deepen our love for you, God, whatever needs to be confessed, I pray you would lead us toward confession, whatever needs to be realized, God, I pray that you would lead us toward that spiritual realization, God, whatever patterns need to be adjusted, God, whatever relationships
[time=3500] need to be deepened, whatever things might need to be said, God, I pray that as we give
[time=3506] ourselves to the study that you would move us down that road with great strength and with
[time=3512] great power, we thank you, God, for your great love, and we thank you for the opportunity, God, to know you and to serve you, we want to do that with great passion, we want it stir deep in our hearts, and I pray, God, that as we examine our lives, you would grow that
[time=3529] in us in your son's name we pray, amen.
