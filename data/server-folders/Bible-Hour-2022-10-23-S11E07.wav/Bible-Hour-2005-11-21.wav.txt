[time=478] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=490] It's good to have you with us and I am so thankful for the opportunity that we have to share with you today what took place in our worship service this past week.
[time=501] You may remember if you watched a couple of weeks ago, I invited not only our family here at Blackhawk, but I extended a special invitation to you in the viewing audience.
[time=513] I asked you if maybe you would be willing over the next several weeks to engage in something that I think is very, very important, important for you, important for me, something very necessary in our ongoing spiritual development.
[time=530] A couple of weeks ago I asked you, would you be willing to spend a season of time self-examining ourselves, our lives, looking closely at the reality of our lives, who we are, what we're giving ourselves to, the way we're conducting ourselves.
[time=549] I asked you the question, how's your life?
[time=552] And I have continued to ask that question over the last couple of weeks and I wanna ask it to you again today, how is your life?
[time=559] And not so much circumstantially, what are the circumstances of your life, but what are you doing with it?
[time=567] What are you giving your life to?
[time=570] How are you spending it?
[time=571] These days that keep going by, days that we'll never get back.
[time=576] How are you living your life?
[time=579] And today what you're gonna see is the first of three messages that will deal with this issue of stewardship, you and I being faithful to use all that God has given us in a God-honoring way.
[time=594] And we begin today with this issue of time.
[time=597] That's right, the 24 hours a day that he gives us, the 168 hours in a week, you back a few out for sleep and you end up with about 125 or so.
[time=611] What are you doing really with this time that God has given you?
[time=617] The scriptures teach that there is great, great opportunity, like kingdom opportunity.
[time=623] I mean, stuff that really matters, God's word says there is great opportunity that he gives us with this time that we've been allotted.
[time=631] And this morning I want you to just open up your heart and open up your mind and see for yourself what God's word has to say.
[time=639] And as you look into with us as we look at God's word, I want you to just be willing to look at your life.
[time=645] And I hope today as you watch the broadcast and as we spend this time together, I hope that you would be open to maybe changing some things, maybe adjusting some things, maybe altering some things in your life.
[time=658] The way you and I use our time is so very important.
[time=662] And I hope that as you listen today, I hope you'll be encouraged.
[time=666] And I hope that you'll today consider how it is that you could use your time maybe more wisely, maybe more intentionally to bring great glory and great honor to him.
[time=678] Next week we'll go on to talent, stewarding and investing our talent in a way that brings great glory and honor to God.
[time=687] And then a couple of weeks from now we're gonna hit on this issue of our treasures.
[time=692] Our finances, stewarding our time, our talent and our treasure over the next three weeks.
[time=698] You and I willing to take a very close and personal look with great honesty, I hope and with great sincerity so that we can see in each of those areas the things that God may have for us.
[time=711] So join us today, come back next week and let's continue this journey of self-examination with the spirit of God's help and the word of God's help.
[time=720] God bless you, have a great week and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=724] - Psalm 11, verse four says, "The Lord is in his holy temple.
[time=732] The Lord is on his heavenly throne.
[time=735] He observes us, the sons of men, his eyes examine them.
[time=740] The Lord examines the righteous.
[time=743] The Lord is in his holy temple.
[time=748] The Lord is on his heavenly throne.
[time=750] He observes the sons of men, his eyes examine them.
[time=754] The Lord examines the righteous." (gentle piano music)
[time=779] [MUSIC - 126 seconds]
[time=915] (gentle piano music) - Well, what is your life, song, singing these days?
[time=932] Everybody's got a song, right?
[time=940] I mean, everybody's got a life.
[time=942] And your life, and my life.
[time=946] And in the way that we live them and the choices that we make, the direction that we go, the thoughts that we think, the priorities that we possess, your life and mine has a song.
[time=960] And it is our hope, it is my hope, I know, as we spend time together here in this setting, as I mentioned to you a couple weeks ago, I would invite you to a season of examining your life.
[time=973] Many of you have responded, many of you have sent emails and written notes or just pulled me aside and said, you know what, I'm in.
[time=980] I'm a little afraid, I'm a little leery, but you know what, I will for these next four, five weeks with you, I will examine, allow the Spirit of God, ask for the Spirit of God and the Word of God, for God Himself to search out my life.
[time=997] And I am so grateful that many of you in this room are willing to do that very thing.
[time=1002] How's, as I've asked you before, how's your life?
[time=1005] How is it these days?
[time=1008] Really?
[time=1011] How's your life?
[time=1013] All of it.
[time=1015] If you asked me, well, how's yours?
[time=1019] I would have a couple of things to report to you today.
[time=1023] I'm encouraged on a few fronts, some very good things taking place, things I'm extremely grateful for.
[time=1031] The other day, those of you that know me know that my wife and I, Deborah, have five kids.
[time=1036] Those of you that know us well know that three and a half, almost four years ago, now when that fifth one came, rather unexpectedly, we were thrown for quite a loop, but it was a loop we were thankful for, but boy, God has taught us an awful lot over these last four years now.
[time=1053] We have been through many a journey, we have learned many a lesson all over again.
[time=1057] Many of you have helped us in those days.
[time=1060] You've helped our marriage, you've helped our family, you've encouraged us with notes.
[time=1065] God has really been faithful as we have made it through these last four years.
[time=1069] She is gonna be four, heavy is, and just a week or so.
[time=1073] And there was a really, really significant, this might not mean anything to a bunch of you, so bear with me.
[time=1080] But it was a very, you're asking me, if you're asking me how I'm doing, I gotta tell you this.
[time=1084] There was a very significant moment in our garage a couple weeks ago.
[time=1088] We, the birds, went on a bike ride.
[time=1091] And what I wanna tell you about the bike ride, and this is the key, here's the key setup for the bike ride, there were seven of us on seven separate bikes.
[time=1101] All seven birds went on a bike ride.
[time=1105] Did you catch that?
[time=1107] All seven on seven bikes.
[time=1109] The key thought there, the thing I want you to pick up on is there was no bike seat on my wife's bike for the first time in forever.
[time=1122] I don't know, 12 years, it seems like forever.
[time=1125] And it was an amazing thing.
[time=1127] We kind of gathered around the bike, as dad got out the tools, you know, me and my tools.
[time=1132] I got out the tools, and I figured out how to take this bike seat off Kevin's bike, and I took that thing off, and we went on a bike ride, and we rode down to the end of the street, we dumped the bikes behind these trees, we found these trails, we went on a hike for about an hour and a half, came back, it was an amazing day.
[time=1148] Evie, three years old riding a bike by her, she's three, she ties her shoes by herself, she gets dressed by herself, and don't you dare try and help her do anything.
[time=1158] Russell T. Donner had to ride the bike, she rides it now on her own, completely self-sufficient for the most part.
[time=1164] And we had an amazing day, we laid in bed that night, my wife and I, and she rolled over, and we were talking about the day, and she had tears, just streaming down her cheeks, and I asked her, you know how you guys, you know how real quick you go, oh gee, what did I do?
[time=1183] (audience laughs) What did I say, what didn't I say?
[time=1188] Did I do something wrong?
[time=1189] She says no, no, no, she's back at the bike seat.
[time=1192] She's back at the bike seat, and all that we've learned, and how good God has been, and it was such a, it was just a bike seat, and somebody reminded me after first hour that the day will come when we'll get the bike seat back out again, and you know, Lord willing, not for our kids, no, but for maybe, gosh, don't even think that.
[time=1217] (audience laughs) But for maybe, you know, grandkids, they were telling me about how fun it was to have car seats back in the car again, and we'll look forward to that, but God's good, isn't he?
[time=1229] It's faithful to bring you, and us through all that we face.
[time=1233] I am so thankful for that.
[time=1236] Life, life in many respects is good.
[time=1238] I tell you what, I'm so thankful for some of the friendships I find myself in the midst of these days.
[time=1245] Many of you, and I have had the privilege of living life together for years.
[time=1249] I continue to meet people, though, you realize that, don't you?
[time=1252] I continue to meet folks every week, and God allows me in different circumstances to connect with them, and many of them are on a journey.
[time=1259] You understand that?
[time=1262] Many of the people that I get the privilege of speaking to, and maybe even getting to spend some more time with, and they're on a journey, and God brings them to us through all kinds of avenues, through all kinds of means.
[time=1276] But the people that I meet and the conversations that I have, it just leads me to wanna, A, I just want you to know how thankful I am for that.
[time=1282] B, it reminds me that I wanna tell you that never, ever forget, my friends, that the people that he brings, and the opportunities that we have with them, spiritually, personally.
[time=1293] Folks that walk through those doors, the folks that tune in at seven o'clock on a Sunday morning, the people who make their way into my office, or however it is, we might get to meet them.
[time=1303] As I meet them and speak with them, I'm reminded that in this spiritual journey, the ground that we meet on is level.
[time=1313] Level ground, I'm reminded of it all the time.
[time=1317] Rich, poor, somewhere in between.
[time=1320] Red, yellow, black, white.
[time=1324] White collar, blue, Republican, Democrat.
[time=1331] Young, old, middle-aged, it just doesn't matter.
[time=1338] In this spiritual journey that he allows us to take with these folks, we get to meet on level ground provided by the person of Christ.
[time=1346] And I hope you and I never forget that.
[time=1349] I hope you're as willing and ready to always embrace any opportunity he might bring your way.
[time=1355] With the same enthusiasm and the same readiness and the same willingness, no matter who it is, no matter where they're from.
[time=1361] And I am so thankful for several ongoing opportunities.
[time=1367] He's got me right in the middle of, so very thankful.
[time=1371] So how's your life?
[time=1373] This morning I want to ask you about your life as it relates to in our ongoing self-examination here.
[time=1379] I want to ask you how your life is as it relates to your time.
[time=1383] See, because while I'm thankful for the garage and the bikes and all of that, and I'm thankful for so many other things in my life, I got to stand here today and tell every one of you that I need help.
[time=1393] I really need some help.
[time=1397] There continues to be arenas of my life where I continue to struggle and continue to need God's guiding hand and God's building edifying and equipping work in my life.
[time=1409] There is so much in me that still needs so much help.
[time=1413] And as I think about it, the help that I need and the growth that has got to continue, if I'm gonna be the man and the husband and the father and the leader that God's called me to be, my mind goes to three arenas of my life.
[time=1427] Now hear me, this is not all inclusive.
[time=1429] I know that there would be other ways that we could say this, but I want you, if you're willing to look at you as I look at me and as we self-examine with the spirit of God's help, I want to invite you to join me at a very personal, honest look at our time, the way we use, the way we approach, the way we spend our time, our talent, the giftedness that God has given each and every one of you in this room and our treasure.
[time=1459] Next three weeks, I want to ask you how you're doing.
[time=1463] As it relates to you and I, stewarding, being good stewards with our time and our talent and our treasure, and I want to begin today with your time.
[time=1472] And what is a good steward?
[time=1473] I wrote this to you in an email recently.
[time=1476] I gave you a definition.
[time=1477] I want to remind you of that definition this morning.
[time=1480] Good stewardship is the faithful God honoring use of all that he has given you.
[time=1485] Write that down.
[time=1487] Use that this morning as a point of reference for our discussion.
[time=1490] Good stewardship here at Blackhawk, one of our five E's, is excellent stewardship.
[time=1496] And a lot of you ask me, well, what is stewardship?
[time=1498] It is the faithful God honoring use of all that he has given you.
[time=1503] And in my opinion, the key word, the most important word in that statement is the word what?
[time=1511] All, the faithful God honoring use.
[time=1514] And listen, of every single thing that he has given you.
[time=1521] And just wrap your mind around that for a moment.
[time=1528] Everything, everything that he has given you, he asks that you would steward it well, that you would faithfully and in a God honoring way, use it.
[time=1541] Invest in it further, take care of it.
[time=1544] Good stewardship.
[time=1545] And let me ask you this morning, are you honoring God with the way you approach and use your time?
[time=1552] Or is your time using you?
[time=1556] Maybe look at it that way.
[time=1557] Are you honoring God in the way you use and conduct yourself and approach your time?
[time=1562] Or is your time using you?
[time=1564] Are you spending your time or are you investing your time?
[time=1571] Are you spending it?
[time=1572] Boom, there, you used it and it's gone.
[time=1575] Or are you using it?
[time=1576] Are you investing into it so that it can come back again and again and again in a way that would bring great glory and honor to God?
[time=1586] What's the bottom line motivation for you when it comes to the use of your time?
[time=1592] What is the use of your time all about?
[time=1594] Bottom line, what's the bottom line motivation when it comes to the use of your time?
[time=1600] Look with me at Ephesians, would you?
[time=1602] Ephesians, chapter five.
[time=1604] You say, well, what does God's words say about the use of time?
[time=1607] Actually, it says a great deal I found out in recent weeks.
[time=1610] Look at Ephesians, chapter five.
[time=1612] Here Paul writing to the church at Ephesus addresses this issue.
[time=1616] He says in Ephesians five, we'll pick it up in verse 15.
[time=1621] Listen to the words carefully.
[time=1624] He writes, therefore, be careful how you walk.
[time=1629] That word walk there, meaning how you live.
[time=1631] Therefore, be careful how you walk.
[time=1634] Not as unwise men, but as wise.
[time=1637] Verse 16, making the most of your, what, say it?
[time=1641] Time, making the most of your time.
[time=1644] There's a way that you can waste it.
[time=1646] The scripture seems to indicate.
[time=1648] There's a way that you can not make the most of it.
[time=1651] There's a way that you can lose it.
[time=1653] He says here, be careful, making the most of your time because the day's time, in essence, because the days are evil.
[time=1663] Interesting.
[time=1664] What does that mean?
[time=1667] What does it mean that the days are evil?
[time=1673] Is a day in and of itself evil?
[time=1676] I don't think that's necessarily what he's implying.
[time=1678] I think if in the context, though, you look at what he said, I think it's really clear that if you and I aren't careful, if you and I aren't wise in our approach, right?
[time=1691] If we don't make the most of it, it has a tendency to get away from us.
[time=1699] You with me?
[time=1700] Make the most of it. Be careful. Be wise, he says.
[time=1705] Do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
[time=1711] A day can get away from you.
[time=1714] Time can be lost.
[time=1717] He says, don't be foolish.
[time=1719] I've given it to you and I want you to make the most of every single moment.
[time=1725] Well, I thought this morning that in order to be as practical as possible, I would do my best to paint a picture for us, and I'm going to try to do that for you.
[time=1735] Paint a picture for us this morning, a picture of our time.
[time=1739] And I hope as I try and paint this picture, I hope that all of you will give me a little bit of grace.
[time=1744] I don't attempt to in any way capture everybody's days
[time=1750] just perfectly, but I want to try and capture it in a sense.
[time=1754] I want to be general enough where I hope everybody can identify to some extent, but I want to paint a picture of a day, of the time that God gives you and I.
[time=1764] Where does our time go?
[time=1769] How is our time spent or invested?
[time=1772] Write this down.
[time=1773] Are we time spenders or are we time stewards?
[time=1779] Are you a time spender or are you a time steward?
[time=1785] And to get us going in this direction, would you please, in honor of God's word, would you stand with me and allow me to read for you 1 Corinthians 10, verse 31.
[time=1797] First Corinthians 10, verse 31, many of you who have known the Lord for a number of years, those of you who have studied or heard God's word taught over the years, many of you are familiar with this verse.
[time=1807] This is an off quoted verse.
[time=1809] This is a saying that we've heard many of us who have grown up in the church.
[time=1812] We've heard it for years and years and years.
[time=1815] There may have been a grandmother or grandfather who quoted this to you with his or her finger wagging.
[time=1821] You may have learned it as a young child.
[time=1824] It's a great verse, but this morning, I want you to really, really look at it.
[time=1829] This morning, as we talk about the use or the investment of time, the way you and I conduct ourselves each and every moment of each and every day.
[time=1839] I want you to think about what the Word of God here is saying, what it so clearly teaches and so clearly implies.
[time=1849] 1 Corinthians 10, 31, whether then you eat or drink or read
[time=1857] that out loud.
[time=1860] Say it again.
[time=1863] Whether you eat or drink or listen, whatever you do,
[time=1871] do all, do all to the glory of who.
[time=1877] My friends, the Scripture here in 1 Corinthians 10, 31 clearly states that from the moment your eyes open
[time=1887] to the moment your eyes close, every single moment
[time=1894] in between what it says it, whatever you do,
[time=1901] every part of your day, every component of your life by virtue of 1 Corinthians 10, 31 has now been put directly up on the table.
[time=1912] And he says to you and me, in whatever you do.
[time=1917] And it's kind of a daunting truth, but it's kind of cool to think that God would give you and I the capacity to use every single moment, to use every single choice, to use every single action somehow someway to his wife.
[time=1933] I hope it encourages you.
[time=1936] I hope it interests you.
[time=1939] I'll tell you what, my friends, it convicts me.
[time=1943] It just convicts me.
[time=1945] I have got a lot to learn when it comes to whatever you do.
[time=1950] Do all to the glory of God.
[time=1952] So let's examine ourselves and maybe learn some things together.
[time=1957] Father God, thank you for this opportunity to honestly and sincerely look at the reality of our lives.
[time=1964] God, as we do so, please, give us wisdom.
[time=1968] God, thank you for the time, for these days, for these moments, for these breaths that you give us.
[time=1976] Our desire, I believe God, many in the room, would desire to use all of it, to bring great glory and honor to you, help us know what that looks like.
[time=1985] Teach us, God, to do that.
[time=1987] And we'll thank you for it, in your son's name we pray.
[time=1989] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1991] I did the math for you, just in case you want to write this down, 168 hours in a week.
[time=1995] Most of you know that.
[time=1997] Seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 168 hours.
[time=2001] But if you back out of that, 42 for sleep.
[time=2006] I don't know if that's low for you or high.
[time=2007] It's six hours a night.
[time=2009] Everybody good with six hours a night?
[time=2011] Oh, come on.
[time=2013] What's the deal?
[time=2014] Okay, seven.
[time=2016] I hear an eight.
[time=2017] Where's Mitch?
[time=2018] Give me eight, give me eight, give me eight, give me eight.
[time=2020] I'm staying with six.
[time=2021] 42 hours, 168, 126 hours.
[time=2026] Generally is what you and I have got to work with.
[time=2030] What are you gonna do with 126 hours?
[time=2035] All right, so here's the day.
[time=2038] Okay, by and large, bear with me.
[time=2040] The day usually starts with this.
[time=2045] Raise your hand if an alarm clock wakes you up each day.
[time=2049] Go ahead.
[time=2050] All right, thank you.
[time=2051] Others of you I realize have other things that wake you up.
[time=2055] It's all kind of stuff that wakes us up, right?
[time=2057] We won't get into that.
[time=2058] Sometimes it's kids, sometimes it's a noise.
[time=2061] Sometimes we just have alarm clocks kind of built into us.
[time=2064] But an alarm clock, some kind of alarm clock goes off and you and I are up and Adam.
[time=2071] The alarm clock goes off.
[time=2072] We grab the robe or the sweatshirt or whatever it is you grab to make that walk down the hall and you walk down that hall to a number of different things.
[time=2082] Sometimes you make your way, if you're me, when that thing goes off, the first thing I do is I get to the kitchen and I push that button that gets that water dripping and that drug brewing.
[time=2094] It's called caffeine, kids don't flip out.
[time=2097] The pastor's not doing drugs.
[time=2099] Well, he is, but not bad drugs.
[time=2102] Oh, never mind, forget that.
[time=2103] Just talk to your parents about drugs.
[time=2109] Gosh, I got to get out of this conversation.
[time=2113] I make coffee.
[time=2115] Or you go to the toaster.
[time=2118] Or you might push that button and get the coffee going.
[time=2122] You might go to the toaster.
[time=2123] You know what, walking down the hall, moms or dads, maybe this is one of the first things that you do.
[time=2130] Maybe some relief is needed in one of the rooms or cribs.
[time=2134] So that's a possibility as far as those first five, I'm talking about those first five, those first 10 minutes or so.
[time=2140] You got the coffee going possibly.
[time=2142] You get the toaster going.
[time=2143] You got a bagel maybe going in there.
[time=2145] Sometimes we make our way out to the road or possibly it's already been delivered to your porch.
[time=2150] You might pick up the paper and you may start to read about current events and things that are happening.
[time=2155] Some guys want to find out who won what or what place they finished in.
[time=2159] Or look at their players on their fantasy team as disappointing or as exciting as that might be.
[time=2166] All kinds of things going on.
[time=2167] You know coffee, toaster, paper, those first 10 minutes
[time=2174] turn into the next half hour, 45 minutes, and you get dressed and then you're on your way.
[time=2179] Some of you are on your way.
[time=2180] Some of you stay there in that setting.
[time=2183] But either way you kind of go from those first 45 minutes to an hour into that kind of the rest of your day.
[time=2189] And for some, you know, they get in the car.
[time=2191] And when you get in the car, all kinds of possibilities kind of pop up.
[time=2196] When you get in your car, you might get going on this.
[time=2200] The phone calls might be made.
[time=2203] You might get into the car and throw one of these babies in and turn up the volume and kind of off.
[time=2210] You go into that world.
[time=2213] You could do that.
[time=2214] You might be a little bit hipper, a little bit cooler, and you might have an iPod.
[time=2220] Who has an iPod?
[time=2221] Raise your hand.
[time=2223] Oh, we are so on hip.
[time=2224] What happened?
[time=2225] Gee whiz.
[time=2227] I thought these things were like popular.
[time=2229] I don't have one yet.
[time=2231] But anyway, you could throw the ear plugs in and get this thing going.
[time=2234] You may be listening to this.
[time=2235] You may be on this and driving at the same time, which isn't a good idea.
[time=2239] John Brandenberger tells me.
[time=2242] Maybe you stay home.
[time=2245] Maybe you stay home and maybe you-- I don't know.
[time=2247] Maybe you tune.
[time=2249] I don't know if you tune into this.
[time=2251] You might throw a CD in here if you stay home.
[time=2253] You maybe talk radio.
[time=2255] Maybe you dial into 1190 or whatever you listen to.
[time=2259] But you get something going there on that front.
[time=2262] Those who stay home do the things they do at home.
[time=2265] Others might head into the office.
[time=2267] You might head into the classroom.
[time=2270] And when you do that, maybe at the classroom or in the office, you start dealing with this stuff.
[time=2277] This would be a laptop.
[time=2279] And this would be a briefcase.
[time=2282] You go to work.
[time=2284] I don't know where you work.
[time=2285] I don't know what you do.
[time=2286] But you go to work and you write memos and you call meetings and you get on the email and you work on projects.
[time=2295] And you do all that you do.
[time=2298] Not only plan meetings, but you conduct them or you participate in them.
[time=2302] There are decisions that need to be made.
[time=2304] There are customers that need to be serviced.
[time=2306] There are phone calls that need to be returned.
[time=2309] You go and you do what you do between 8 and 5.
[time=2311] My point is that in the midst of all the 8 to 5, there is a lot of interacting going on.
[time=2319] God brings across your path in mind a lot.
[time=2322] But we'll get back to that.
[time=2324] Off we go, laptops and briefcases and meetings.
[time=2329] Maybe we stay home and we're planning things.
[time=2332] Working on stuff with the kids.
[time=2334] Could be maybe some educational stuff going on there.
[time=2337] Whatever it might be.
[time=2338] Maybe getting together with some other friends who stay at home and more interaction taking place there.
[time=2344] Then 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock comes.
[time=2347] And this just kind of depends on who you are.
[time=2349] And it depends on the stage of life I realize.
[time=2352] But oftentimes 4 or 5 o'clock comes and you've got to practice to get somebody to.
[time=2359] You've got to practice to get someone to.
[time=2362] And that practice might look like this, or that practice might look like this.
[time=2367] Or maybe the practice doesn't look like this or that.
[time=2370] Maybe the practice looks like that.
[time=2374] Little gymnastics leotard there.
[time=2377] Precious, isn't it?
[time=2379] They go to the gymnastics place and they tumble and they stretch and they flip and they turn and they walk on that beam.
[time=2386] And maybe that's what 4 to 5 to 6 to 7 p.m.
[time=2392] I don't know what it looks like for you.
[time=2394] These are some things that I know go on in my life.
[time=2397] Then when you get home at some point in time, maybe they all come home to you or everybody kind of meets home.
[time=2403] And then at home, I brought this just as a reminder.
[time=2407] Oftentimes, it's time to eat.
[time=2409] And I've got this right here for the dinner thing.
[time=2413] And I realize, as I hold it up, this is not meant to be a guilt trip.
[time=2416] I realize it may just be Wendy's, all right?
[time=2419] It could be Burger King.
[time=2420] It could come in a bag.
[time=2421] But either way, maybe it's been made.
[time=2423] And it's sitting here in the pot and the pans and all that.
[time=2426] But dinner happens and there's a meal and there's more interactions, more things going on there at the table.
[time=2434] And then the dinner gets done and it's time to maybe either throw away the Wendy's bag or maybe you've got to wash them dishes and put some pots and pans away.
[time=2445] And then it's homework time and maybe bath time.
[time=2448] And then possibly, for some of us-- maybe this comes into the picture-- at some point in the evening.
[time=2457] This is the-- some have called it the God of this decade, the remote control.
[time=2463] And this may come into your world in the morning.
[time=2466] This may present itself to you in the afternoon when you feel like you should be doing other things.
[time=2473] As this just comes into the picture maybe in the evening or at night, possibly it comes into the picture when everyone else is in bed and maybe you should be.
[time=2485] But either way, there's a choice to make.
[time=2489] There's a choice to make with this.
[time=2492] The night-- the night winds down.
[time=2494] And then it's time to go to sleep.
[time=2499] And you go to sleep.
[time=2501] You've got to get your six hours, right?
[time=2504] And you get your six hours.
[time=2505] And then when the six hours is done, something happens.
[time=2513] And off we go again.
[time=2516] So that, my friends, is a day.
[time=2524] If any of that sounded familiar in just-- maybe in just a small way.
[time=2530] Raise your hand.
[time=2532] OK, thanks.
[time=2533] Now, you've got to be careful with that.
[time=2537] I'm glad you raised your hands.
[time=2538] Thanks for the honesty.
[time=2539] Now, here's the point.
[time=2540] I just went through an entire day and at no place, at no time
[time=2548] in that brief discussion that I mentioned, allude to or reference God and His part in all of that.
[time=2563] And I stand here this morning with all of you.
[time=2566] And I say to you, I don't know about you.
[time=2570] But I am capable, me, me, and me.
[time=2572] I am capable of going through a day like that, just like that,
[time=2579] without Him.
[time=2580] And with all of that time, and with all of those interactions,
[time=2588] and with all of those possibilities, what a waste of time that you and I would go through all of that.
[time=2598] And at some point, maybe at the beginning or at some point during the midst of or at some point towards the end, not include Him, not invite Him in, not look to Him for the direction and guidance He may want to give you in the midst of this or this or this or that.
[time=2619] So what I'm going to do is just give you just in a few minutes.
[time=2622] Let me just give you a couple things to think about, can I?
[time=2625] And for some of you, you know what?
[time=2627] I'm learning from some of you how to do this.
[time=2631] So I realize that for some of you in the room, this is a discipline, this is a spiritual discipline, the use of time and an approach to a normal day.
[time=2640] This is something maybe you've been doing for years.
[time=2643] And I thank you for your faithfulness, your good stewardship with the time.
[time=2648] Others of us are learning still.
[time=2650] And I want to just share with you some of the things that I've learned, some of the things that folks have taught me, some of the ways I believe you could in very practical ways as you make your way through your day, keep one ear to the ground and one ear toward heaven, one ear to the realities of every day and one ear toward the whisperings of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2673] One ear, attentive to the everyday needs that you and I experience and face and one ear listening to the nudge and the prompting of God.
[time=2685] Just some things to think about.
[time=2686] Let's go back to the alarm clock, can we?
[time=2689] The alarm clock and I want you to look at this alarm clock and I want you to think about Psalm five versus one to three.
[time=2695] Psalm five versus one to three.
[time=2698] I'm not sure when this goes off in your world, but maybe possibly, possibly there's room in your world.
[time=2705] Is there for this to go off maybe 15 minutes or 20 minutes or 30 minutes earlier?
[time=2713] 'Cause the fact of the matter is, I would bet most of you in the room today, like me, if you're not purposeful, if we don't get intentional, this goes off and in the next moment, we're off.
[time=2726] I mean, we might drag out and put something on, but as soon as we drag out and put something on, off we go.
[time=2732] The day has started and it has started without him.
[time=2737] In a sense, I want you to think about this, the alarm in Psalm five, it says there, give ear to my words, O Lord, at 615 or 545 or 715,
[time=2748] whenever it might be, give ear to my words, O Lord,
[time=2755] consider my groaning, heed the sound of my cry for help, my king and my God, for to you I pray in the morning.
[time=2764] Say that again with me, in the what?
[time=2767] In the morning, O Lord, you will hear my voice.
[time=2772] In the what?
[time=2774] In the morning, I will order my prayer to you and then I will eagerly watch.
[time=2780] I know you, you know me.
[time=2784] I know you well enough to know that you and I wake up with plenty on our mind.
[time=2790] Enough has happened in those last 24 hours.
[time=2796] Enough is about to happen in the 24 that's ahead.
[time=2801] There's enough going on in those rooms down your hallway and they might still be sleeping.
[time=2806] There's things happening at work.
[time=2809] There's spiritual things, God's dealing with it.
[time=2811] There is so much going on inside here and here.
[time=2815] And if you need to slap some water on your face, if you need to get a mug or two down in you before you can do it.
[time=2823] But my encouragement to you is to not even begin to think about facing all of this without first starting with him.
[time=2834] Maybe you take 10 minutes and you read through a Psalms.
[time=2841] Maybe you take five or 10 minutes and you write some notes down as you read questions that come to mind, things that you're thankful for.
[time=2849] And then you take five minutes, maybe and you just pray and you thank God for all that you just read and the stuff that came to your mind and you ask them for the help and the insight that you know you need.
[time=2857] 20, 25 minutes and not that it's a time thing.
[time=2860] Not that 15 would be unspiritual and 40 would be, you know, Nirvana.
[time=2863] I'm just saying, give it some time.
[time=2867] There's a lot, there's a lot ahead.
[time=2870] So it starts here.
[time=2871] Then when you go to the changing table and you're changing that first diaper of the day or you go into the kitchen and you go to the toaster or you're over there at the coffee maker.
[time=2883] Maybe still it would be a good idea to be reminding yourself of some things.
[time=2888] Maybe somewhere in that kitchen or somewhere in that bathroom.
[time=2892] You would wanna just put up on a card or you wanna get a plaque or you wanna just laminate it on your mirror.
[time=2898] Whatever you wanna do, lamentation is 322 and 23.
[time=2901] I think everybody in this room would be wise to start each day with a passage like this.
[time=2909] Visibly present so that you could read it and say it to yourself and really, really mean it.
[time=2915] Look what it says, the Lord's loving kindnesses indeed never cease for his compassion's never fail.
[time=2923] They are new every what, say it.
[time=2926] Morning, great is your faithfulness.
[time=2929] He is a faithful God whose loving kindness never ceases.
[time=2933] His mercies are new every morning and I know for one I am really, really grateful for that and that he is promising again in this day to be faithful.
[time=2943] While you're making that coffee, while you're changing that diaper, while you're working on that lunch, whatever you might be doing, you should be reminding yourself of these kinds of truths.
[time=2954] Then when you get in the car, I don't, you know what?
[time=2957] I'm not gonna mandate something here for you.
[time=2960] I'm not gonna get real rigid with you.
[time=2962] I'm just gonna tell you after 42 years, I will say with great confidence and without apology to anybody, even though I fought my parents when I was 17, now I stand here and tell 'em both that they were right, that it really does matter what you fill your head with.
[time=2981] It really does.
[time=2985] What you fill your mind with, what you listen to again and again and again, it really does affect you.
[time=2995] If you wanna fill your head, if you wanna fill your heart with junk and with stuff that's morally or ethically or whatever, if you wanna kinda go that way and kinda head down that road and get all into that, that's your choice.
[time=3013] When you fill your heart and your soul with that, somehow, someway, it comes out.
[time=3021] So I would encourage you, slip something in or listen to something that's going to remind you, educate you, teach you, challenge you, encourage you along the lines of that which is true and right and good.
[time=3037] David seemed to understand this, my friends, and Psalm 119, excuse me, yeah, Psalm 119.
[time=3045] Look at Psalm 119 verse nine.
[time=3051] Psalm 119, verses nine through 11.
[time=3054] Look what it says.
[time=3055] How can a young man, oh, what a question.
[time=3058] What a question for today, huh?
[time=3062] How can a young man keep his way pure and don't let the translation there allow you to tune out?
[time=3070] You know what, it's real easy.
[time=3071] We can just say, how can a housewife keep her way pure?
[time=3076] How can a businessman or business woman keep their way pure?
[time=3080] How can you as a student at the age of 12 or 13 or 14 keep your way pure?
[time=3086] How can you as a senior adult who continues to wrestle with
[time=3092] and engage in the struggles of, well, how can anybody keep their way pure?
[time=3100] Anybody want to know?
[time=3102] I do.
[time=3105] I do, fathers of five, pastors of churches need to keep their way pure.
[time=3110] And I have found there's one way to do that.
[time=3113] Look what it says.
[time=3115] By keeping it according to your word.
[time=3118] I keep reminding you here this morning to try and in the midst of your first couple, two, three hours, fill your day with the truth.
[time=3125] And you can fill it with truth in a number of different ways, but my plea to you is this, fill it with truth.
[time=3132] It says, with all my heart I have sought you.
[time=3135] Do not let me wander from your commandments because I'll do it.
[time=3140] I'll wander.
[time=3141] Your word.
[time=3142] I have treasured.
[time=3144] Your word I have hid.
[time=3145] Your word I have deposited.
[time=3147] Your word I have placed.
[time=3152] I have treasured your word in my what?
[time=3156] In my heart that I may, here you go, that I may not what?
[time=3160] Sin against you.
[time=3162] Verse 15, verse 15 says, Psalm 119, 15 says, I will meditate on your precepts and regard your ways.
[time=3171] And verse 16 says, I shall delight in your statutes.
[time=3175] I shall not forget your word.
[time=3181] There are opportunities for you in and throughout your entire day to keep that truth front and center.
[time=3187] There's another thing I want to mention to you.
[time=3189] Dean, would you hand me this?
[time=3191] I found these and I'll give these to you.
[time=3193] Anybody who wants one can have one today.
[time=3195] This is a sticker that we gave out about three years ago.
[time=3198] And on it, it says, take five.
[time=3200] And I want to just remind you of something before I let you go this morning.
[time=3204] Take five.
[time=3206] This was a, it says, take five and then there's two hands in a worshipful position on it.
[time=3211] Oh, you see it there, thanks.
[time=3213] And you peel off the back and you can stick this anywhere.
[time=3218] And the take five was an encouragement to you and I.
[time=3222] To take five seconds before, you know, you take the iPod and you put the take five sticker on there.
[time=3230] You take the cell phone and you put the take five sticker on it.
[time=3233] You get the remote control and you put the take five sticker on it.
[time=3239] You take five seconds.
[time=3240] You take the sticker and you put it on your briefcase.
[time=3243] You put it on your laptop.
[time=3245] The take five is a visual reminder to take five seconds before
[time=3251] you do what you're about to do before you put it on your phone.
[time=3254] You put it on your computer in the office before you answer that email, before you make that phone call, before you have that meeting, you take five seconds and you say, oh, God.
[time=3267] May I in these next few moments represent you and honor you?
[time=3272] Well, God, God, okay, I'll take ten seconds.
[time=3275] May you help me see what you have for me.
[time=3278] Kingdom wise, not just business wise, not just school wise, not just this, but kingdom wise.
[time=3285] God, if in this phone call there's something you want me to do or say, you let me know.
[time=3290] And you just, you know, you just plaster these things all over your world and if that sounds like a crutch to somebody.
[time=3299] All right.
[time=3303] I'll take a crutch.
[time=3305] If my options are a crutch, which somebody reminded me after first hour crutches are prescribed oftentimes for health
[time=3315] and continued growth and rehabilitation.
[time=3318] So I might need one or two or three or four, but I'll take that if it means moving me down this road and taking me down this path.
[time=3328] I'll tell you what, the soccer game, if you want one, you can just have one.
[time=3332] I'll have them up here.
[time=3333] You can take five of them, you can take ten.
[time=3334] At the basketball game and soccer game and in the gymnastics place, don't ever forget, my friends.
[time=3340] Don't ever forget that it's not just a practice and it's not just a game.
[time=3344] There's always somebody on the sideline.
[time=3347] There's always somebody across the way.
[time=3349] More than likely, there's somebody that God's going to place there next to you or nearby you who might could just use a handshake.
[time=3356] They might could just use a hello.
[time=3358] Bill Hibles talked about it at our vision night downtown in September.
[time=3362] You and I never, ever should forget to take that walk across the field, that walk down the sideline, that walk across the studio to say hello to someone who may need to have you say hello to them.
[time=3374] And at nighttime, boy, I'll tell you what, dads, I hope you're doing everything you can to help.
[time=3380] When you get home, I understand that you and I need some rest and we need some renewal.
[time=3386] I'm completely for that.
[time=3388] I also know that kids need help with homework.
[time=3391] Young ones need baths.
[time=3393] Hope that you're not watching a lot of TV.
[time=3396] There's not a whole lot to watch.
[time=3398] Hope that you're spending time, two, three nights a week with your kids on the floor in the living room, reading a Bible story, asking them some questions, praying with them at night.
[time=3407] I hope after you get them tucked in, guys.
[time=3410] I hope a couple, two, three nights a week.
[time=3412] You're in the bedroom with your wife and you've got a book.
[time=3415] We've got a stack of books next to our bed.
[time=3417] We're just working our way through.
[time=3419] And you know what?
[time=3420] We read maybe about a page at night.
[time=3422] We sit up.
[time=3423] If we lay down, we go to sleep.
[time=3424] I don't know about you.
[time=3425] But if we lay down, we're dead.
[time=3426] We're gone.
[time=3427] So we sit up and we might read a page.
[time=3429] And we might get through a paragraph or two.
[time=3431] Questions come up.
[time=3432] We start talking.
[time=3433] The talking always leads to just a chance to pray about what we're learning there or reading.
[time=3439] I might make my way down the hall one last time.
[time=3442] Get to each bedside and say a few more prayers.
[time=3446] And then I hit the pillow and then the alarm goes off.
[time=3449] And somebody challenged me with this recently.
[time=3452] When the alarm goes off, do you hit the ground running?
[time=3456] Or do you hit the ground kneeling?
[time=3459] And I would encourage you to hit the ground kneeling.
[time=3462] And I would encourage you to keep kneeling throughout your entire day.
[time=3468] It's the only time you'll get.
[time=3471] These moments are the only moments we'll get.
[time=3474] There's no do-overs.
[time=3476] I pray and I hope that you and I will use the time well.
[time=3481] He is a God who redeems it.
[time=3483] He redeems the time.
[time=3484] He promises to come alongside and honor that effort in you.
[time=3488] And I pray that you will as you look at your life and your time.
[time=3492] I hope these things will encourage you.
[time=3493] Let's stand and go.
[time=3495] Father, thank you for the time this morning.
[time=3497] I pray that you would in a very strong and powerful way give a strength to steward our time well.
[time=3502] Thank you so very much for this family.
[time=3504] God, thank you for what we mean to each other.
[time=3507] Thank you for the strength to work through difficulty together.
[time=3510] And God, I pray that you would keep us unified in the end.
[time=3513] Stewarding our time and our talent and our treasure well.
