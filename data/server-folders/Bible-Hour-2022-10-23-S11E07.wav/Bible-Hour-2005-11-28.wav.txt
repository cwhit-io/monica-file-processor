[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=52] and on earth. Therefore go and make disciples of all nature, baptizing them in the name
[time=64] of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=74] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
[time=85] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=109] Let's do that again.
[time=113] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=118] Blessed be your name.
[time=122] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=126] Blessed be your glorious name.
[time=133] [AMEN]
[time=139] [MUSIC]
[time=168] Let my walks be loud, and my words be true.
[time=176] Let my light be cold with my eyes on you.
[time=183] Lord, I'm stepping out from the comfort zone, letting go of me, holding on to you.
[time=197] Let my feet on comes, when I call you the Lord, you are Lord my God, you are the center
[time=212] I've been on, the universe declassmen on, the majesty, I surrender all, I make you the
[time=226] center of my life, Lord, I'm stepping all by now.
[time=232] You place me in the song of heavens melody, no majesty, a light is to sing your song.
[time=244] [MUSIC]
[time=261] I have found your peace, it replaces any fear, you have done it all, I can trust in you.
[time=273] Lord, I'm stepping out from the comfort zone, letting go of me, holding on to you.
[time=287] Let my feet on comes, when I call you the Lord, you are Lord my God, you are the center
[time=304] I've been on, the universe declassmen on, your majesty, I surrender all, I make you
[time=317] the center of my life, Lord, I respond with all I am.
[time=323] You place me in the song of heavens melody, no majesty, a light is to sing your song.
[time=339] [MUSIC]
[time=357] My father I adore, my father I enjoy more than anything my heart could wish for.
[time=368] I just want you, Jesus my love and Savior, everything that I want to you, I hope it all
[time=382] to you, and angels come, and I adore you, and we all our children worship you.
[time=407] You are my world, you are my God, and I laid down my life for you.
[time=422] You are my Lord, the one out of love, no one could ever take your place.
[time=433] Let's do that again, you are my world, you are my God, and I laid down my life for you.
[time=445] You are my Lord, the one out of love, no one could ever take your place.
[time=472] And I am Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and what a privilege it is to be with you again on the Bible Hour broadcast.
[time=480] I am so thankful for these times, I have told you that again, and again in the past.
[time=485] I am so grateful for the relationship that we have, and I realize in many, many cases
[time=491] I never get to see you, I never get to shake your hand, I never get to hear your story, I never get to really kind of bump up against you, but I tell you what, it means the world to me when I get to hear from you.
[time=504] And I want to just invite you today, if you would just take a moment and maybe write out
[time=510] a note or better yet, just send me an email.
[time=513] You can reach me and the team here at kbird@blackhawkministries.org, and that's my email, and I don't
[time=523] mind giving it to you, because here's what I'd love you to do, you know, if the broadcast in some way has encouraged you, if you have received teaching that God's used to further
[time=533] grow you in your faith, if our times together here are helping you on your journey toward
[time=539] faith.
[time=540] I mean, however it is that God has used this to encourage your heart and soul, I would love to just hear that from you.
[time=547] And not just for my sake, really for the sake of others, there is an entire team of folks who give time and effort to bring you this broadcast and it means the world to them when they hear about the things that God is doing in the lives of real people that our broadcast is able to reach.
[time=563] And so if you have a minute this week, just shoot us a note, give me an email and let me hear about how God has been encouraging you through what he does here on the broadcast.
[time=573] Secondly, I want to say this to you, everybody watching, everybody listening today, if you're out there in the Bible Hour viewing audience, I want to make a special invitation to you.
[time=584] As you know, Christmas and the Christmas season and all that we get to celebrate as believers
[time=591] is coming upon us quickly.
[time=593] And at Blackhawk for years, we have established a tradition of celebrating Christmas through
[time=600] the arts.
[time=601] For years it was the living Christmas tree and in recent years we have started a new tradition.
[time=607] It's called Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=609] And Friday night, December 9th at 830, I would like to invite you to come and be a part of
[time=615] a very, very special night.
[time=617] It is the premier concert, the premier concert showing of our 2005 CWB series.
[time=625] And I would love it if you would come and be with us that night.
[time=628] There are plenty of seats, you can just come on your own, you don't have to do anything in advance, just come and be with us.
[time=636] The doors will open, I think, probably about 8 o'clock.
[time=639] You can come in, get some seats, and we would love to have you with us that night.
[time=643] I would love to meet you, I would love to be able to shake your hand, I would love to be able to wish you the best at this time of year, and thank you for your support.
[time=652] So not only you, but tell some friends, bring some family, talk to some folks at work.
[time=658] It's going to be a fantastic night, 830 is when the concert begins.
[time=662] I've seen a little bit of the production, I've talked to the folks who are involved.
[time=667] I'm telling you from the video work that's been done, to the musical compositions that have been made, the vocal stuff, the choir, the special effects, the staging.
[time=677] It is going to be an absolutely spectacular, and more than that, I think, deeply encouraging
[time=683] time for all of us as we celebrate again this incredible Christmas story.
[time=687] So come and be with us.
[time=689] We'd love to have you here Friday night, December 9th, 830 for the premier concert of this year's Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=696] We hope to see you then.
[time=698] God bless you, and have a great week.
[time=703] It's all about you, Jesus, and all this is for you.
[time=723] For your glory and your fame, it's not about me.
[time=732] As if you should do things my way, you alone are gone, and I surrender to your ways.
[time=748] Jesus, love her on my soul, all construe me fire is in your gaze.
[time=764] Jesus, I want you to know, I will follow you on my day.
[time=777] Though one else in history is like you, the history itself belongs to you.
[time=793] I'll find a man you have loved me, and I will share eternity with you.
[time=809] It's all about you, Jesus, and all this is for you.
[time=822] For your glory and your fame, it's not about me.
[time=832] As if you should do things my way, you alone are gone, and I surrender, it's all about
[time=846] you.
[time=847] Jesus, I want you to know, for you, you alone are gone, and your fame, it's not about me.
[time=863] As if you should do things my way, you alone are gone, and I surrender to your ways.
[time=880] For the last couple of weeks, we have been talking about, the Word of God has been asking
[time=903] you, I've been trying to kind of follow up and ask you a pretty serious, very important
[time=909] question about your life, how is your life?
[time=917] And as we've asked that question, we've tried to kind of differentiate, we've been asking it not so much in regard to your circumstances, but more with respect to what are you doing with your life?
[time=929] What are you giving it to?
[time=931] What are you investing in?
[time=932] What are you valuing?
[time=934] How are the priorities?
[time=937] What kind of life song are you singing?
[time=942] And we established the fact that everybody's singing one, we're just now trying to figure out what kind of song it is.
[time=950] We've talked about being good stewards with our lives, being faithful and God honoring with all that God has given us.
[time=957] And as Corbin sings for you here in these next few moments, I want you to kind of view it just as an introduction to the message and a beginning of our time in the Word together.
[time=967] And I would just invite you to, if you want to just close your eyes, if you want to just bow your head, you may want to keep them wide open, but as he sings, don't allow these words to escape the opportunity that they present to just consider your life and the
[time=984] direction that it's heading, the things that you're valuing, the kind of life that you're
[time=990] leading, and I'll come back up in just a moment, and we'll continue on in our discussion.
[time=1020] You reach a world that needs to be your hands and feet.
[time=1028] Show me the words I sing, and the things I do, make my life song sing, and you smile to
[time=1042] you, and I'll let you hear, I'll let you hear, I'll let you hear, I'll let you hear, I'll
[time=1070] let my life song sing to you, I'll let you hear, I'll let you hear, I'll let my life song
[time=1091] sing to you, I'll let my life song sing to you, I'll let my life song sing to you, I
[time=1112] want to sign your name to the end of this day, knowing that my heart was true, and my life
[time=1121] song sing, and my life song sing, let my life song sing to you.
[time=1139] Hey, I wanted to ask you to do something this morning.
[time=1145] If you would, I know a lot of you aren't note takers, no big deal.
[time=1149] I'm going to just force you to do something for just a couple of minutes.
[time=1152] Could you grab a pen?
[time=1153] Maybe something to write with.
[time=1155] Everybody just, for the sake of our beginning here, I need you to have a pen and a piece of paper to write on, grab some scratch sheets from the back of your Bible, some old sermon notes, use the bulletin, whatever you can, try and find something to write on.
[time=1170] And I want you to just write a few things down here as we start.
[time=1175] Thank you for doing that.
[time=1180] I've told you about this guy, I've referenced this guy many times in the past.
[time=1188] Over the years that we've been able to spend time together in settings like this and in other settings, I've often referenced my grandpa Joe.
[time=1197] Grandpa Joe's full name was Joseph R. Jackson.
[time=1204] And Grandpa Joe, as I've said before, he was an amazing man.
[time=1208] And when I think about the legacy that he left and the influence that he had on my life, it was an amazing thing.
[time=1214] Grandpa Joe overcame repeatedly in a number of different seasons of his life.
[time=1219] He overcame poverty.
[time=1222] He by and large, when it was all said and done, had really battled alcoholism pretty well.
[time=1230] And again, as a young boy growing up and even as a high school and college student, I was more impressed by and more deeply grateful for the way that he battled it.
[time=1242] Not so much thrown by the presence of it, if that makes sense.
[time=1245] I was just so grateful for the way he stayed at that.
[time=1249] He had a complete hearing loss and survived the depression and in the midst of all that
[time=1256] left an enduring legacy that lives on today in I think 18 or 19 grandchildren and I think
[time=1263] maybe 17 or 18 great, it's some amazing number of great grandkids, all of whom, some of whom
[time=1270] experienced him personally, all of whom now have heard about him.
[time=1274] And I want you to just write this down if you would, humor me or honor me and just write down grandpa Jackson, 1916 to 1989, 1916 to 19, 1916 to 1989.
[time=1292] Just write that the way you would see it there in your mind's eye, 1916 to 1989.
[time=1297] Hey and do this, why don't you?
[time=1301] Maybe just think of somebody in your life, if you can, maybe many of you in the room could do this, maybe some of you can't.
[time=1307] But think of somebody in your life who made an impact in your world.
[time=1313] They influenced you, they encouraged you, they made a great deal to you, they may have been younger, they may have been older, we may have said goodbye to them too soon.
[time=1320] But nonetheless, think of somebody in your life who's faithfulness and whose love and
[time=1326] whose commitment is something that today you still look back on with great gratitude and thankfulness and write their name and then just write their dates the way you would see those dates in your mind's eye, go ahead.
[time=1339] Go ahead and just write that name down, whoever that is, could be a son, could be a daughter, could be a husband, a wife, a grandfather, a grandmother.
[time=1349] Write that name down and write those dates.
[time=1356] And as you do that, I want to just share with you a conversation that we had this week, we were in staff meeting.
[time=1363] And as we were in staff meeting this week, this topic came up and we were discussing these things that you and I will discuss this morning.
[time=1370] And Mitchell referenced, Pastor Mitch, he referenced a conversation he had had recently
[time=1378] where in this conversation they were talking about dates, these kind of dates, the dates
[time=1387] that you just wrote down.
[time=1389] And there was a question asked that I thought was very profound and I want to share it with you this morning and Mitch just relayed this to it and the question went like this, what will you, you, what will you do with your dash?
[time=1409] What will you do with your dash?
[time=1415] You say, well, what do you mean by, by dash?
[time=1419] Well, if you wrote those dates, like most of us write those dates, you got a dash, a
[time=1427] little hyphen in there in between those dates.
[time=1434] I had him digitize something up here, don't get whacked out or weirded by it, but I just,
[time=1441] I was just thinking about it this week.
[time=1444] And I realized again that every one of us in this room, right, everybody in this room,
[time=1451] though there's so much more to the end of our earthly stay than this, everybody's going
[time=1459] to in some way shape or form, we're all going to kind of end up here.
[time=1464] And I want you to look at that dash, my friends, that dash right there after 1963, you see
[time=1472] that dash is the sum total of your entire life right there.
[time=1481] Your whole life, all that you did, yes, but more importantly, all that you were.
[time=1487] That dash is all that you represented, all that you stood for, all that you gave yourself to.
[time=1493] It is your entire legacy right there in one little black mark.
[time=1501] And I think little black mark is appropriate because it's really just a, it's really just
[time=1507] a very little thing in the scope of eternity, right?
[time=1512] Long breaks always telling me, "Birdman, it's just a blip.
[time=1516] It's just a blip on a screen." James said it's a hot breath, it's a vapor, it's a hot breath on a cold night.
[time=1525] It's just here and it's gone.
[time=1529] That dash, your entire existence.
[time=1535] And if you're here today, if you're watching on the broadcast, if you're listening online
[time=1541] wherever you are, if you're alive, then your dash, don't miss this, your dash is still
[time=1547] in progress.
[time=1550] Your life story is still being written.
[time=1552] Your life song is still being composed.
[time=1560] Now I want you to, I want you to notice something else.
[time=1563] And again, as I thought about it, it was, it was a little, I was a little unsettling
[time=1570] and at the same time it was kind of interesting to think about.
[time=1573] There is a, somewhere on that tombstone, on that headstone, usually some folks get together
[time=1580] and they look back on your dash and they write some words about you.
[time=1588] Right?
[time=1589] It's called an epitaph.
[time=1592] And I wonder what your epitaph will read.
[time=1596] I wonder what it will read, I wonder what it would say today.
[time=1602] Let's see, sometimes that's a different deal there.
[time=1606] I wrote one down, bear with me here.
[time=1609] I just said this, I just was in my office, boy, it took me longer than I had imagined.
[time=1614] It was an interesting exercise.
[time=1616] I just wrote down, "He loved God, her, and them more than anything and more than any
[time=1622] others and he cared for his flock." Now bear with me lest you think that sounds self-serving.
[time=1633] If you still have breath today, you still get to influence the epitaph, my friends.
[time=1640] You still have opportunity to honor God and impact others in meaningful ways.
[time=1644] If you're alive today, you can grow, spiritually grow, and you can make much of God with your
[time=1650] life.
[time=1651] And as you look at my epitaph there, what I want you to see and understand is this.
[time=1656] That's what I, that's what I hope it will say.
[time=1662] Please hear me.
[time=1663] I am not standing here today saying to you that that's what it says.
[time=1666] I am saying to you, I hope and pray to God that that's what it could say or something
[time=1673] like that whenever that day comes.
[time=1677] I hope with all of my heart that I will have handled, that I will have managed, that I will have been an excellent steward with all that he gave me, with all that God entrusted
[time=1690] to me, in all of my lifetime in such a way that they would be led to write something like that.
[time=1696] And you know what maybe you should do?
[time=1697] It's an interesting exercise.
[time=1698] Why don't you just take a moment today, maybe tonight, that pen that you've got in your
[time=1704] hand, why don't you just pull it back out this evening?
[time=1707] Why don't you, in some quiet place, at some quiet moment, if you can have or find one
[time=1713] of those, just take a few minutes and why don't you write down what you hope and pray.
[time=1718] They might say about you when it's all said and done.
[time=1723] And you know what, if you're 13 years old, if you're 14 years old, it doesn't matter if you're 17, 18, 24, 37, doesn't matter, just go ahead and just do it.
[time=1732] Just take a moment and write out your epitaph.
[time=1734] And then you know what you should do?
[time=1735] You should take that epitaph that you've written out and share it with your small group or your small community that meets there in that living room.
[time=1743] You should take it to your best of friends.
[time=1745] You should go to your accountability group.
[time=1747] You should go to your class.
[time=1748] I mean, go to where it is you live and share your life and say, hey, this is what I'm hoping
[time=1755] it might say.
[time=1757] Maybe they can share with you what they're hoping it might say.
[time=1759] It'd be a great family exercise if your crew's old enough to kind of maybe think through that
[time=1765] or work through that.
[time=1766] But given some thought, it all deals with your life.
[time=1772] How's your life?
[time=1775] Last morning, how's your life?
[time=1777] Last week we talked about being good stewards of your time.
[time=1781] How is your life?
[time=1782] How are you handling all this time that God has entrusted to you?
[time=1786] We define good stewardship as the faithful God-honoring use of all that He has given
[time=1792] us.
[time=1793] And this morning I want to ask you not so much about your time.
[time=1795] I want to take you to another topic.
[time=1798] It's very related.
[time=1799] It's your talent.
[time=1802] And Black Hawk, you'll hear us talk often about our five E's and one of those E's is excellent stewardship that you and I would be people who are growing in our commitment to honor God by being excellent stewards with our time, our talent, and our treasure.
[time=1819] And this morning I'd like to invite you into a discussion and into some teaching here from God's Word that will address this issue.
[time=1826] And listen, as it relates to this word talent, as it relates to this idea of talent, I want
[time=1833] for the purpose of our discussion today, I want you to keep that pen out, just one more minute and write this down, okay?
[time=1838] This will be helpful I think as we use certain terminology today, talent in the midst of this
[time=1845] discussion today is going to be this, it is your unique ability.
[time=1850] See, here's why I'm defining it because when I say talent, you think Tiger Woods.
[time=1855] See when I say your talent, you think Donald Trump, when I say talent, you think Martha
[time=1862] Stewart, you might not think about Martha Stewart anymore, but you might think something else.
[time=1865] I say talent, our minds go boom.
[time=1868] We go to the top upper echelon of folks and then we sit there and you look back at me and
[time=1874] you say I'm going to sit this one out because I don't have much.
[time=1877] And that's not the kind of talent that we're talking about today.
[time=1882] Today we are talking about, write this down, your unique, your, your, every single person
[time=1889] in this room has been given some unique ability, your unique ability to do whatever it is,
[time=1898] here's the key, to do whatever it is you do, there, everybody's in the mix now.
[time=1904] Your unique ability to do whatever it is you do in a way that brings great honor to God to things, in a way that brings great honor to God and in a way that influences those in your world, whatever your world might be, wherever it might be, whatever it might entail,
[time=1922] whoever it might entail, to bring great honor to God and influence those in your world toward
[time=1929] Christ.
[time=1930] You might be an artist, you might be an athlete, you might be a teacher, you might be a surgeon,
[time=1937] you might be an entrepreneur, you may own a small business, you may make 650 an hour,
[time=1943] you may change diapers all day long, or at least it feels that way, you might drive
[time=1950] a truck, you might grow corn, I don't know, whatever it is you do.
[time=1959] You are called by God and you are called by the Word of God to be, we are called by God to be an excellent steward with the abilities and opportunities that God has given you.
[time=1967] Well you might sit there this morning and say hey Kelly, does it really, I mean does it really, really matter?
[time=1975] I mean it's just a, it's just a dash, it's just a bunch of words you know on a rock.
[time=1983] I mean does it really, really matter and see I would stand here this morning and I would say back to you, I would say back to you with every ounce of energy and persuasion that the Spirit of God would allow me to muster and say oh it does, oh it does.
[time=2000] It absolutely does.
[time=2002] It matters a great deal and I just wrote down a few examples, those people that you make 650 an hour with or those folks who make 850 an hour with, wherever it is that you punch
[time=2013] in and punch out, wherever it is that you spend those 8, 9 or 10 hours, those people, they
[time=2021] desperately need to have truth and love lived out in the everyday of your life with them.
[time=2028] So many of those folks that you work with, so many of those people that you rub shoulders with, they don't have the hope and they don't have the assurance and they've never ever
[time=2038] gotten the clarity that the Spirit of God has brought to your own heart and life as you've embraced relationship with Him.
[time=2047] They live in the midst of a very, very confusing world, a discouraging reality in many cases
[time=2053] and they desperately need the light that you can bring and the hope that you can offer.
[time=2061] You bet it's worth it.
[time=2062] I wrote down this, the lender, the lender, the banker that you're interfacing with as
[time=2068] you close on yet another one of your entrepreneurial deals, he or she needs to see your character
[time=2074] and your integrity and your love for God.
[time=2078] He or she may not see that anywhere else ever.
[time=2082] He or she may live in a world that is absolutely void and absent of character and integrity.
[time=2090] And as you do what you do in those settings, as you make those deals and as you close those deals for them and all those in that world to see you do that with your expertise, yes, but with your heart and your love for Him and your character, it's an amazing opportunity
[time=2106] for the kingdom of God to be advanced in the midst of deal-making, the employees that
[time=2114] you're small business, or how about those kids that you're parenting 25 hours a day?
[time=2123] Seems like that sometimes, doesn't it?
[time=2126] How about them?
[time=2127] You know what?
[time=2128] They desperately need as well for you and I to be good stewards with all that God has given us so that they can be, so that they can be, so that that five-year-old and that eight-year-old and that 14-year-old and that 20-year-old so that they can be equipped and prepared to in their lives make much of God and point others in their world toward
[time=2149] Christ.
[time=2152] You say, "Does it matter?" I would say to you, "Oh, absolutely, it matters." What you do with that dash, the words that would be written on that stone, here's one
[time=2164] more reason though, and I want to just share this with you this morning.
[time=2167] I think one more reason, there's probably several others.
[time=2170] One more reason, though, that I think you may want to give some thought.
[time=2176] You may want to give some thought to the way you steward the unique abilities and opportunities that God has given you.
[time=2183] One more thing I want you to keep in mind, Scripture teaches, my friends, Scripture teaches that God will judge you.
[time=2195] Scripture teaches that as it relates to those opportunities and abilities that God gave you to bring great glory to Him and point others toward Christ to be faithful, Scripture
[time=2207] says that God will judge you.
[time=2211] As it relates to that, you will be judged by God upon His return for what you did or didn't
[time=2217] do with your abilities and your opportunities.
[time=2222] This takes place or we read about it taking place.
[time=2225] Look in your Bibles at 2 Corinthians chapter 10, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, you go through
[time=2231] the Gospels, go through Acts and Romans, and then you come to 1st and 2nd Corinthians.
[time=2236] Look at 2nd Corinthians 10, well, excuse me, 2nd Corinthians 5, and we're going to look
[time=2244] at verse 10.
[time=2249] There's there in 2nd Corinthians 5, Paul writing here to the church at Corinth.
[time=2254] It says in verse 9, "Therefore we also have as our ambition whether at home or absent to be pleasing to Him," verse 10, "for we must all appear," Paul writes here to the
[time=2264] church at Corinth, Paul here speaks to believers.
[time=2270] Those there and those of us here who have entered into that personal relationship with Jesus Christ, he says, "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ so that
[time=2282] each one may be recompensed, so that each one may be blessed, so that each one may be
[time=2289] rewarded, so that each one may be given to for His deeds in the body according to what
[time=2296] He has done, whether good or bad.
[time=2302] Now this is something that we don't speak to a lot, it's, I think, an area of teaching
[time=2308] that we probably need to do a better job of, and let me just say this to you about this judgment seat of Christ.
[time=2315] The judgment seat, it's so amazing too that this would come in a letter to the church at Corinth.
[time=2320] They would have been, you'll see here in just a moment, they would have been very, very aware of what He was getting at here.
[time=2325] Let me explain this to you.
[time=2326] The judgment seat was, the judgment seat itself was an elevated platform.
[time=2333] In the Greek it was called a Bhima, B-E, long E-M-A, Bhima seat.
[time=2340] It was a Bhima platform.
[time=2343] It was an elevated platform called a Bhima.
[time=2346] It was a place where faithful, victorious athletes received their rewards, their crowns,
[time=2355] if you will.
[time=2357] It's incredible in Corinth.
[time=2359] They would every few years or so have an enormous event.
[time=2362] It was a, it was a then kind of a worldwide gathering of athletes that was called the Istmian Games, ISTH, Istmian Games, all the great athletes in all the world would come
[time=2373] to Corinth, and they would participate over a two week period of time.
[time=2378] Sound familiar?
[time=2379] It's, it's exactly like what the Olympics are for us today and in modern times, and they
[time=2385] would come and compete, and they would race, and, and they would throw, and they would wrestle, and the winners, the faithful ones who had trained hard, those who had come out
[time=2395] on top, those who had persevered to the end, those who had won the prize were put up on
[time=2401] the Bhima platform, and these wreaths, these crowns were placed on their head.
[time=2409] When Paul says the judgment seat, and in their minds they hear Bhima, they know exactly what he's talking about here.
[time=2418] Important to take note here for you listening today, this is not about this judgment here
[time=2424] at the Bhima.
[time=2425] Remember, this is not about sin.
[time=2429] This is not about sin.
[time=2431] Praise God, my friends, that the judgment and the consequences, and all that came with
[time=2439] your sin and mine, past, present, and future, got dealt with completely once and for all
[time=2448] on a brutal thing called the cross.
[time=2452] There we see our sin being judged.
[time=2456] This is not about sin, this is about faithfulness, and at the Bhima seat, at the judgment seat
[time=2462] of Christ, heavenly kingdom rewards.
[time=2466] Now we're not talking about wreaths, now we're not talking about those kinds of earthly crowns, now we're talking about eternal crowns.
[time=2476] Heavenly kingdom rewards will be given or withheld based upon your stewardship, your
[time=2483] faithfulness in life to live and choose with eternal priorities.
[time=2488] To put it simply, the Bhima seat judgment is where God asks and answers one very important
[time=2494] question.
[time=2495] Did you make the most?
[time=2498] With your effort and by God's grace, did you make the most spiritually?
[time=2503] Did you?
[time=2504] With all that he gave and all that he gifted you with and all the opportunities that he brought, did you show yourself to be one who was faithful in that?
[time=2514] Did you make the most of what God gave you, the opportunities and the abilities he entrusted to you, were you faithful to make much of him or did you squander the opportunities?
[time=2527] In the boardroom, how did you do?
[time=2531] With so much at stake, who did you honor?
[time=2535] Who did you point people towards in the way that you conducted yourself?
[time=2539] In the kitchen, in the operating room, in the car, in the classroom, wherever it is you
[time=2550] are doing whatever it is you do, remember?
[time=2553] He gives you the opportunity to faithfully, daily, make much of him while pointing others
[time=2561] toward Christ.
[time=2565] The judgment of sin for those who have rejected Christ, you can look at Revelation 20 and
[time=2575] you can see how all that unfolds.
[time=2577] It's an amazing picture of God's zeal and his justice and his wrath and his judgment
[time=2585] Revelation 20, the great white throne.
[time=2588] But at the beam of seat, you and I will be judged as it relates to our faithfulness
[time=2595] in executing and giving ourselves to the opportunities and the abilities that God gave us.
[time=2600] Well, let me ask you to do this.
[time=2603] I know we're already into this a bit, but I want to read to you a passage and I want to read to you a passage that I think really in many respects kind of captures the essence of what we're talking about here this morning.
[time=2615] I want you to turn in your Bibles to Matthew 25, if you would, and I want you to just read through this with me, and I hope as we read through this I hope that you'll be able to and I'll try and help you as we go.
[time=2625] I want you to sense that you, whoever you are, whatever it is you do.
[time=2631] My friends, you and I have been given opportunities to be excellent stewards with the talent,
[time=2639] with the abilities and opportunities that God has brought to your life.
[time=2642] Look at Matthew 25, this parable of the talents, Matthew 25 verses 14, and we're going to go
[time=2652] down through verse 28, and in honor of God's Word, would you stand with me and allow me
[time=2658] to read this to us?
[time=2662] Before it is, it says in verse 14, "For it is just like a man about to go on a journey." From the parable here, the man, the master, this refers to the person of Christ, the ultimate
[time=2674] ruler and king, our Lord and Savior, it says here for it is just like a man about to go on a journey who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them.
[time=2685] To one he gave five talents, and I'll stop you right there and tell you that a talent, in this case, in this text, yes, the talent is referring to an amount of money, and we're
[time=2696] going to talk more about that issue in your life and mind in the weeks to come, but bear with me here, this is something that's being given, and it has great opportunity that comes with it, and a talent was about, watch this, one talent was about 15 years worth of wages
[time=2714] for a slave.
[time=2716] This guy's dishing out quite a bit, there's a lot on the line.
[time=2721] To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his
[time=2727] read it out loud, say it, his own ability, and he went on his journey, now verse 16 immediately,
[time=2735] the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them.
[time=2739] This guy actually goes out and kind of steps out there a little bit, he goes out there and he takes a little bit of risk, he goes out there and he kind of mixes it up, I mean this guy is motivated to go and take what the master had given him and do something with
[time=2754] it that hopefully would bring a return, he trades with them and gained five more talents.
[time=2760] In the same manner the one who had received the two talents, in the same manner meaning he went out and traded as well, in the same manner the one who had received the two talents gained two more, but he who received the one talent went away and dug a hole, he dug a
[time=2779] hole, no risk, no activity, no movement, no walking out on any limb at all, just went
[time=2786] and dug a hole and hid his master's money.
[time=2791] Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
[time=2797] You see that now after a long time, again my friends after a long time it has already been a long time, but we're reminded as we read this that after a long time the Lord
[time=2808] will return, amen, and when he returns he comes to settle what?
[time=2814] He comes to settle accounts and you and I will stand there face to face and our faithfulness
[time=2826] will be assessed, he comes to settle accounts with them, the one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents saying master you entrusted five talents to me see I have gained five more talents, his master said to him well done, you got to love
[time=2843] this phrase well done good and faithful slave, you were faithful with a few things I will put you in charge of many things, notice he said five, he referenced five talents as being a few things, you were faithful with a few things, to the guy with five I will
[time=2860] put you in charge of many, enter into the joy of your master, also the one who had received the two talents came up and said master you entrusted two talents to me see I have gained two more talents, his master said to him well done, good and faithful slave you were faithful with a what, with a few things see the five gets called a few and the two gets called a few and in the end they get entrusted with many, enter into the joy of your master
[time=2886] and the one also who had received one talent came up and said master watch this now, master
[time=2894] I knew you to be a hard man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered
[time=2900] no seed and I was afraid and I went away and hid your talent in the ground see you have
[time=2908] what is yours as you study this passage you know what you find out and I see this often
[time=2914] I see it in you and I see it in me, this third guy you see how he describes the master I
[time=2922] don't know if you caught the verbiage there but that was not a good description but his
[time=2928] master, your master in mine he's a very very good, he's a very good master the sky didn't
[time=2937] know his master this guy had an inaccurate view of his master and when caught when exposed
[time=2947] and when being revealed for who he was all of a sudden he just starts spewing stuff that's
[time=2955] not even true as he attempts to kind of back pedal and cover himself but his master answered and said to you you wicked lazy slave you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather
[time=2966] where I scattered no seed then you ought to have put my he he says in essence okay you know what if that were true about me which it's not then you ought to have verse 27 you
[time=2976] ought to have put my money in the bank and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest therefore take away the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents you can have a seat I want you to see three things before we go
[time=2991] this morning if you've got those pins out you might want to just write a couple things down stewarding our talents it's real simple it's real basic but you know what it's very
[time=3000] profound when you think about the implications it has in your life in mind look at verses 14 and 15 it's just like a man about to go on a journey calls his own slaves and entrusts
[time=3010] his possessions to them to one he gave five to one he gave two and to one he gave one my friends listen when it comes to the opportunities of life when it comes to the unique abilities
[time=3023] that God gives us okay it's really okay in fact it's the way God designed it that some
[time=3029] would have an opportunity picture that looks like this there are there are five talent people
[time=3037] in the kingdom of God and for whatever reason God gives them what he gives them and God calls them to be accountable with all of that and in the end and in the end what matters
[time=3049] most is that they were faithful and brought a return there are some who's whose opportunity
[time=3056] or ability picture looks like this you know you might be a two talent guy or gal and to
[time=3064] some he gave and to some he gave one and what breaks my heart what tears me up is times
[time=3072] where I see where I see certain people and it's because I think of the way we work this in our minds and culture we have placed such value and we have put such priority and we
[time=3082] have built up this this five talent picture over here and it kills me when I see two talent
[time=3089] or one talent folks live in their lives trying to be five talent and gauging or judging their
[time=3095] lives and their effectiveness based upon this picture over here and I want to just remind
[time=3101] you differing abilities he gave based upon differing abilities he wired you he made you
[time=3111] he put you in the spot that he put you in and how big it is or how broad it is or what
[time=3117] it looks like isn't the issue second Corinthians 5 10 the beam of seat you and I standing before
[time=3124] him the issue is your faithfulness to make the most of what he's given you look what
[time=3133] it says there one goal one goal one goal five talent guy two talent two two talent guy one
[time=3141] talent guy as you read through that passage you get the distinct impression that all that really mattered in the end was that the master wanted so desperately to see that they had taken what he had given them and that they had gone and traded with it that they had
[time=3157] whatever you were going to do you know what's like in the end there you realize he didn't want you to just dig a hole and hide it and hoard it and keep it to yourself he wanted
[time=3168] you to go and give it he wanted you to go and invest it he wanted you to go and and and deposit it into the hearts and lives of those in your world and in the process make much of him and point others toward Christ same goal it doesn't matter don't you don't you
[time=3184] for a second nobody nobody in this room nobody watching on the broadcast don't you for a second look at me or anybody else who stands behind a podium like this and think to yourself
[time=3199] oh my goodness lots and lots of people and cameras and broadcasts and wow and blah blah
[time=3208] blah blah blah blah blah no don't you dare even think about looking at at me and for
[time=3216] a moment forgetting the utter significance of that one or two or three that gather around
[time=3224] your table every night don't you forget that the size of the picture isn't the issue the
[time=3231] issue is what did you do with those that God put right in front of you did you invest
[time=3238] truth in their heart did you spend time with them did you evidence to them God's love did you teach them about life did you spend time with them did you sit down with the Bible
[time=3249] two three four nights a week and help develop in them a love for what God's word says did
[time=3255] you point them toward Christ whether it's the three of them or the thirty of them or the three thousand of them it doesn't matter what matters is are we being faithful with
[time=3267] the talent with the ability and opportunities that God has given us and then don't miss that third one there you can just write that down hearts exposed as this parable kind of
[time=3278] unfolds for us what you see there in the end with that last guy what you see there in the
[time=3284] end is what maybe I don't know maybe you see in you today I know I've seen it in me before
[time=3291] you see what listen what we do with the unique ability and opportunities that God's given
[time=3297] us what we do with them the way we approach them it says it says everything about what's going on in here and if that's about your kingdom if that's about your profit if that's about your prominence if that's about your reputation if that's about your leisure if that's about your satisfaction if that's about your name if it's about you if all you're
[time=3320] really doing with all that he gave you was digging a hole and hoarding it to yourself
[time=3327] see all that gets exposed in time that comes out but don't let it be about you let it be
[time=3334] about him let it be about him boardroom operating room kitchen bedroom classroom a cab of a
[time=3343] truck a combine wherever it is you are doing whatever it is you do he's given you unique
[time=3352] opportunities to make much of him and point others toward Christ and when you and I do that we steward our talent well and I hope that's what you're willing to do you know
[time=3363] what my friends if you need some help with that if you really need some help trying to figure out how to be you in that unique place that God has you if you're really interested
[time=3374] in being in that unique place and making much of him and pointing others toward Christ so that in the end he looks at you and says well done good and faithful servant I love what Paul says at the end of it all Paul Paul says this in 2nd Timothy 4 4 I am already
[time=3390] being poured out as a drink offering and the time of my departure has come I have I want you to say this I want you to be able to articulate this I want each and every one of us to be able to in the end communicate this I have fought the good fight I have finished the
[time=3405] course I have kept the what the faith and the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not
[time=3416] only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing let's stand and let me pray for you as we go our Father in heaven we pray today as we stand here in this room together
[time=3429] we pray that our life song will continue God to be a song that as it's composed God as
[time=3437] we're learning what we're learning as we're seeing what we're seeing in your word and in our lives God I pray that we would be people who would steward well who would be
[time=3448] faithful and God honoring and the way we conduct ourselves and the way that we live

[time=3507] joy of relationship with you thank you for this family and God I pray that you would continue
