[time=30] Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and
[time=49] on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all news, but baptizing them in the name of the Father
[time=61] and of the Son and of Holy Spirit."
[time=71] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=77] the end of the age, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=92] Right now we stand together in this room, and we sing about the holiness of our God and
[time=101] how this whole earth is filled with this glory, and the psalmist says that the heavens are
[time=107] telling the glory of God, it says that the rocks and the hills cry out.
[time=112] All of his creation declares his majesty, his glory, his holiness.
[time=119] Sometimes it's hard for us, his creation, to remember what we were created for.
[time=126] And so it's moments like this where it's really good for us to just pause and stop and remember that we were created for his glory and that we were created to proclaim his greatness.
[time=137] And so we're doing that together here through songs, and we're going to do it again as we study and understand his word, but we want his praise to always be on our lips, and
[time=147] we want there forever for the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts to be pleasing in his sight, as the psalmist says.
[time=155] And so as we sing this song and we continue to join the elders and angels in saying, "Holy,
[time=161] holy, holy is the Lord God almighty, the God who was and is and is to come." Maybe you need to just close your eyes and remind yourself that that's what you were created for, and that's what this life that God has given you, this breath and this air that he's given you in your lungs, that's what it's all about, it's to make his name known and to declare his fame and his greatness into all the earth.
[time=184] Let's sing together.
[time=190] Alleluia.
[time=196] For the Lord God almighty, praise.
[time=205] Alleluia.
[time=217] For the Lord God almighty, praise.
[time=224] Alleluia.
[time=226] For the Lord God almighty, the God who was and is to come to be His name, the God who
[time=242] was and is to come to be His name.
[time=248] For the Lord God almighty, the Lord God almighty, the Lord God almighty, the Lord God almighty
[time=458] [MUSIC - 8 seconds]
[time=473] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I want to welcome you today to the Bible Hour, and I want to welcome you to the set of Christmas with Black Hawk.
[time=483] We are so thankful to, again, have the privilege of inviting this entire community to come and to celebrate with us this most amazing of stories, the story of our Lord's birth, and for almost 30 years now, we've been doing it.
[time=500] Today, we call it Christmas with Black Hawk, and as most of you may know, we're already into the first weekend, as you view this this morning.
[time=508] Most of you are viewing this on Sunday morning, and we've already had a Friday night opening and a Saturday, and there still is a concert today, Sunday at 3.30.
[time=518] We would love for you to come.
[time=520] If you don't have tickets, you can come to the door and pick a few up, we'll squeeze you in, and today at 3.30, you can take part in what is really an amazing celebration.
[time=529] I've got a friend here at Black Hawk who has been a part of our Christmas celebrations for over 20 years.
[time=536] He mentioned to me just the other day, he said his involvement this year has probably been the most special and the most meaningful of any of his 20-plus years.
[time=546] He says what God is doing and what our team has been able to do with God's help is one of the most special, most amazing productions he's ever seen, and I would have to agree.
[time=556] I hope you'll come and visit us.
[time=557] Next weekend, there are more shows coming, more opportunities for you to come, for you to bring a friend and come.
[time=564] On the 16th, 17th, and 18th, on the screen here, you'll see those times, and if you need some tickets, some special reserved seating tickets, or just some general admission tickets, you can call this phone number during office hours, Monday through Friday, and they would love to help you get some tickets in your hands.
[time=583] So come and join us for Christmas with Black Hawk.
[time=586] We would love to have you here.
[time=588] We would love for you to say hello to us afterwards.
[time=590] It would be great to be together.
[time=592] And speaking of being together, let me just extend this special and I hope very personal invitation to you.
[time=599] Those of you in the viewing audience, you know how much we appreciate you, you know how in a sense we view you as part of this family, and the Black Hawk family is going to gather again on Christmas Eve.
[time=611] What a special night that is, and it is going to be a beautiful celebration of our Lord's birth at four o'clock and six o'clock, four and six p.m. on Christmas Eve, two services, and we would love for you to come.
[time=624] Bring your family, and bring your friends, and be a part of what is going to be a very special night.
[time=629] Musically, we're going to sing together.
[time=631] We're going to remember our Lord's birth and His sacrifice as we come to the communion table, and we're going to fellowship together, and we would love to have you with us.
[time=641] So come and join us Christmas Eve, four and six p.m.
[time=645] and our hope is that whether it's today, this afternoon, whether it's next weekend at the concerts, or maybe even Christmas Eve, our hope is that we could connect with you in a more meaningful way.
[time=657] We love you, and we're thankful for what God is doing in your life, and our hope is that we could be together soon.
[time=663] God bless you.
[time=664] Have a great week, and Merry Christmas.
[time=666] [MUSIC - 95 seconds]
[time=766] - Let your life song sing.
[time=780] If you've been around for the last, oh, a couple weeks or so, I guess it's been more than a couple.
[time=787] Maybe the last three or four weeks, you know that Corbin's been singing that song and we've asked him to sing that song with real purpose and with real intent because we've been asking you and we've been asking ourselves a very important, very serious question.
[time=807] How's your life?
[time=814] I mean, really.
[time=816] And if you've been around for a few weeks, you know that we're not asking so much, how's your life circumstantially?
[time=822] What's happening that's hard?
[time=825] Or what's taking place that's so frustrating?
[time=827] Or what's gone south at the workplace?
[time=831] Though there may be some things there for you and I to consider on the circumstantial side, we've been asking the question with a little bit different angle.
[time=840] When we say how's your life, we've really been asking more specifically what are you doing with your life?
[time=850] What are you doing with it?
[time=853] How are you living it?
[time=855] What are you giving it to?
[time=857] What are the priorities?
[time=859] I mean, really, when you get right down to it in the everyday of your life and mind, what are you doing with your life?
[time=866] We've talked about over the last several weeks what God's word has to say about how we live our lives.
[time=873] We've looked at this concept of stewardship, stewardship, being good stewards.
[time=879] We've defined it in the most basic and simplest way we could as we've looked to God's word and as we've thought about you and I being good or excellent stewards with our lives.
[time=891] We've said it this way.
[time=892] Stewardship is the faithful God honoring use of all that he has given us.
[time=899] And I want you to think about that this morning before we go any further again, all that he has given you.
[time=905] Think about all that you've been given by him and he says he wants you and I to faithfully and in God honoring ways, use it, invest it, offer it.
[time=919] My mind goes back to 1 Corinthians 10.
[time=924] We were there just a few weeks ago and I read this verse to you.
[time=927] It says in 1 Corinthians 1031, look at that definition on the screen right there and think about what we saw in 1 Corinthians 1031.
[time=934] Whether then you eat or drink or whatever you do.
[time=939] God's word leaves no room.
[time=944] There's no way out on this for anybody in the room today.
[time=947] Whatever you do, wherever you are, whatever your vocation, whatever your age, whatever your stage in life, he says whether you eat or drink in whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[time=964] Be a faithful steward with this life that God has given you.
[time=969] And so over recent weeks, we have looked at what it might mean.
[time=972] We've looked to the scriptures and tried to paint a picture of what it would be for you and I to faithfully steward our time.
[time=980] We talked about that.
[time=981] Our talent and now today we come to our treasure.
[time=986] Our treasure, our resources.
[time=990] Whatever amount that is that God has made available to you, however it is he has chosen to bless you.
[time=997] At this point in time, the resources that you have to work with, the finances, the dollars, the cash, however you wanna say it, God's word says a great deal about the way you and I are to approach money.
[time=1009] The way we're to approach giving, the way we're to approach, approach investing, our treasures and the way we steward it.
[time=1018] God's word says a great, great deal about it.
[time=1022] And there are all through the scriptures.
[time=1024] There are examples of those who have done that well.
[time=1028] And there are examples of those who have not done so well in stewarding their treasure, stewarding the resources.
[time=1036] Mitch has an example, I think, is it Luke 12?
[time=1039] - Luke 12, Jesus tells this parable of a bad steward, of a foolish steward.
[time=1045] And tucked away in that parable is a verse, it's real easy to blow by and it's Luke 12, 15 and it says, a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.
[time=1055] Let me say that again, a man's life.
[time=1058] A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.
[time=1064] And Jesus goes on to describe what he's saying and he concludes that parable by saying, you know what, the guy was rich toward himself and not rich toward God.
[time=1073] And this is kinda the deal what we're seeing here today is that this comes down to a heart condition.
[time=1079] It comes down to a heart condition, it's either humble or it's proud, either functions in humility or pride.
[time=1085] And the heart condition is determined by the direction of my desires.
[time=1090] You might wanna write that down, my heart condition is determined by the direction of my desires.
[time=1095] I'm either rich toward God, that's humility or I'm rich toward myself, that's pride.
[time=1102] And so we wanna ask you today to examine yourself, examine your heart in that realm.
[time=1110] Where, to find out the condition of your heart, you gotta ask this question.
[time=1114] Where do I direct my desires?
[time=1117] What's the object of my desires?
[time=1119] You notice that he said, "Examine your heart." And I just wanna tell ya, it's as natural as can be for me to listen to a passage like this.
[time=1130] Listen to these guys talk about, or anybody talk about money and for me, to think about the person next to me.
[time=1137] The person that has more or less, doesn't matter.
[time=1143] I have a tendency to think about the person that's next to me instead of examining my own heart and understanding what it is that God wants me to do with mine, I'll tell ya something.
[time=1154] If the person next to ya has more than you do when it comes to cash, you need to pray for them.
[time=1161] The burden that comes with money and what to do with it to build a kingdom instead of using, the burden is huge and we need to pray for the people that have more, for the people that have less, we need to give to them and pray for them.
[time=1179] And I'll add to that just real quickly, and this is very important, I think for all of us to hear this morning, oftentimes when we get into a message like this, again, as Steve mentioned, the shift in thinking goes to those who have.
[time=1196] And I want you to just understand, as you see this message this morning developed, I want you to see so very clearly that the principles that God's word addresses, especially these principles that you'll see addressed this morning.
[time=1208] This pertains to the guy or the gal that makes 28.5 a year.
[time=1213] This is for the $7.50 an hour kid.
[time=1219] This is for the guy who makes 300 grand.
[time=1223] It doesn't matter.
[time=1224] This isn't today about amounts, it's about your heart.
[time=1227] - Yes.
[time=1228] - This isn't about amounts, this is about your heart and what God says to your heart this morning.
[time=1235] And as Mitch referenced, and I'm gonna let him just describe a few things here in a second, your heart as it, listen, your heart as it relates to money, your heart and mind as it relates to our resources.
[time=1246] We are either motivated by what rests at the center of our hearts and souls as it relates to money is either a thing called pride.
[time=1256] And if that's the case, then we make money and our pursuit of it and all that comes with it about us.
[time=1264] Or what rests at the center is a thing called humility.
[time=1268] A humble part that doesn't make it about us, it makes it about him.
[time=1276] And if a heart makes it about him, then we know that as soon as we make it about him, he helps us make it about others.
[time=1282] And as you think about your life, and as specifically this morning, as you think about this arena of resources, we believe the three of us would stand here and tell you we believe that there are four universal desires, four universal motivations, God given that motivate all that we do, especially as it relates to this issue of resources.
[time=1306] Mitch is going to take you to Genesis and explain that to you briefly.
[time=1309] - Let's look at Genesis beginning 127.
[time=1312] Genesis 127, if you want to turn there, I'll go through this quickly through about 30.
[time=1317] And it says that God created man in his own image.
[time=1320] In the image of God, he created him, male and female, he created them.
[time=1324] I want you to write this down.
[time=1326] This is the desire of significance.
[time=1328] Our desire for significance comes from being made in the image of God.
[time=1336] There is nothing more significant than that.
[time=1339] And then the fact that God would love us, die for us, resurrect and provide a spirit to dwell in us, actually take residence in us.
[time=1345] Our significance comes from being made in the image of God.
[time=1350] And I believe that what you're seeing here is a creation of a humble heart with the desires directed toward God.
[time=1355] Okay, so it goes on, and it says God blessed them.
[time=1360] And God said to them, be fruitful and multiply.
[time=1363] And fill the earth and subdue it.
[time=1366] God blessed them.
[time=1368] This is the desire of contentment.
[time=1370] Write that down, contentment.
[time=1371] Our contentment, our desire of contentment, comes from the blessing of God.
[time=1377] Our desires fulfilled in the blessing of God.
[time=1380] And it says God said be fruitful and multiply.
[time=1383] They're content enough to give, generous, multiply and fill the earth and then subdue it.
[time=1389] The Hebrew word for subdue is kibosh, and it literally means bring contentment to the earth.
[time=1393] So this is God's desire for contentment placed in us, I believe.
[time=1398] The third one is control.
[time=1400] If you wanna write that down, the third desire is control.
[time=1402] And look what he says, I need to go back up where we were.
[time=1406] He says, rule over the fish.
[time=1409] Rule over everything.
[time=1411] Rule over the fish of the seas and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
[time=1416] This is called the dominion covenant.
[time=1418] God said to man, you rule over it.
[time=1421] I'm giving you this desire for control.
[time=1423] And this comes from my authority.
[time=1427] My authority, significance comes from being made, created in the image of God.
[time=1432] Contentment comes from the blessing of God.
[time=1434] And this is, this offer control comes from the authority of God.
[time=1439] And then finally we have security, if you wanna write it down.
[time=1444] Security.
[time=1446] And then God said, behold, I've given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth and every tree which has fruit yielding seed, it shall be food for you.
[time=1454] I'm taking care of you, God says.
[time=1457] There's this desire for security that's only gonna be fulfilled in me.
[time=1461] And I'll do that, God says.
[time=1464] But then in Genesis three, Adam and Eve take humble hearts and they commit the first sin of pride.
[time=1473] And for the first time, the direction of their desires are moved away from God and to themselves.
[time=1482] And since that moment, every person that comes through this side on this earth, every single person in this room is born with this kind of hardened heart, this proud heart, a heart that's quick to say, and we see a little children, to make life all about me.
[time=1498] But we wanna ask you today, where's the direction of your desires?
[time=1505] Where's the direction of your desires, the desires of your heart that God put there?
[time=1511] Where's the direction?
[time=1512] 'Cause that determines the condition of your heart.
[time=1515] They're either toward you and our culture's measurement of our pride is money.
[time=1522] I say this way, pride's measurement of our giftedness is money.
[time=1526] That's like the common denominator by which we'll measure our pride in today's world.
[time=1532] And so that's making life all about me.
[time=1535] So where are the desires of your heart?
[time=1538] Are they directed toward you or in humility?
[time=1540] Are they directed toward God?
[time=1542] Really, no, really.
[time=1544] And that's what we're gonna look at.
[time=1545] - Next week, we're gonna emphasize humility, pursuing God in humility and desiring these good things.
[time=1555] See, significance is a really good thing.
[time=1561] And we need to desire significance validated by him.
[time=1564] And so next week, it'll be all good news.
[time=1567] But today, get ready 'cause just feel convicted.
[time=1571] It's okay.
[time=1572] We're gonna walk out of here feeling some conviction because we're gonna dwell on what our pride in our flesh can drive us to do.
[time=1581] And when it comes to significance, money and the things that money buys can come between us and other people because we want them to see us through our things.
[time=1594] We want them to evaluate us based on how much we have because that might make us feel more significant.
[time=1604] I've been in some settings like that.
[time=1608] We'll talk about those in a minute, but let's look at Matthew chapter six, verses 19 to 21, just to start.
[time=1616] Pride seeks significance for money.
[time=1618] Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
[time=1627] But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
[time=1631] That's why you're here, folks.
[time=1633] We can store up for ourselves treasures in heaven while we're on earth.
[time=1637] Where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[time=1644] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
[time=1649] Read that again.
[time=1650] Where you invest your treasure, your heart will follow.
[time=1656] Be selective about where you're investing your treasure.
[time=1660] Make it, put it in a place that you're once your heart to go because your heart will go there.
[time=1670] I've been in some settings where I felt like from a worldly perspective, the least significant cat in the land.
[time=1681] I remember once we were at a hotel, it may be the finest hotel in the United States.
[time=1689] We were staying there for a few days and in the morning we went down to have breakfast.
[time=1694] They treated us like, it was really nice.
[time=1698] And we went down to have breakfast and over here, I noticed there were some Colorado Rockies that I knew, major league baseball players.
[time=1706] And I was like, wow.
[time=1707] And over here were a couple of people from Hollywood that I recognized.
[time=1712] And I thought, well, it didn't take long for me to realize.
[time=1717] I was longing for the significance that they were experiencing.
[time=1723] I wasn't experiencing it.
[time=1726] And I realized why, you know, Nancy and I talked about this later, like our red shirts were a little faded 'cause they'd been washed.
[time=1735] Our navy blue wasn't quite, you know what I'm talking about, don't you?
[time=1740] And their stuff was all really bright.
[time=1743] And I don't think it took long for the servers to figure out who the significant people were.
[time=1749] I mean, most of them they could tell by their faces, they could recognize them, they didn't know me.
[time=1754] They look like Sean Connery.
[time=1755] (audience laughing) - It's true.
[time=1758] - Actually, they mistake me for a lot uglier people than that.
[time=1763] - Sean.
[time=1765] - Man, you really can't think, he's all prone.
[time=1771] - I like that.
[time=1773] The insignificance that I experienced there, and you know what?
[time=1776] Danger, danger when you feel like you're the least significant person, when you're being, when you're judging yourself by the same human standards that are dangerous for those of us who have the most.
[time=1790] And I've been there too, folks.
[time=1792] I've been in a country where we were the richest people in the country.
[time=1797] I had more than anybody in the country, including the rulers, they didn't have Nintendo.
[time=1804] I know that.
[time=1808] I've been insignificant, and I've been really significant by the world standards, and they're both as meaningless as can be.
[time=1817] Because if we are pursuing our significance through cash or things that cash buys, the result, the result of that, is in significance.
[time=1831] That'll go up there now.
[time=1833] In significance, be careful.
[time=1838] So you think you're gonna find it by stoning up on Earth, and God's designed it a different way, we'll talk about next week, but the result is, thieves break in and steal.
[time=1846] You know, miles and rust destroy, and that's the insignificance of it all.
[time=1852] We're hardwired with these desires to only be fulfilled in one place, Psalm 145 16 says that, only in one place.
[time=1859] - You're not allowed to talk about that until next week.
[time=1861] - I'm sorry, I'm gonna preach.
[time=1863] - It's all right, pride.
[time=1864] When pride rests at the center of your approach, your pursuit of money, finances, resources,
[time=1876] and that whole arena, when pride sits at the middle, you seek significance from money.
[time=1882] Secondly, write this down, you seek contentment from money.
[time=1890] Go back to our passage, look at Matthew 6.
[time=1892] The verses will come up on the screen.
[time=1895] Matthew 6 verse 22, it says the eye is the lamp of the body.
[time=1900] So then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light, there's contentment right there.
[time=1907] But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.
[time=1912] If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness?
[time=1918] There is a sense where it can be very deceiving in this pursuit of contentment.
[time=1923] We can go all kinds of places, thinking or feeling as if we've actually found something or have something when in fact it's darkness.
[time=1932] Contentment, pride seeks contentment from money.
[time=1935] Here's an illustration for you.
[time=1937] Here's a picture for you right from the pages of scripture, of a guy who gave himself to quite a journey.
[time=1946] It made quite an effort in his hope that he might find contentment for his soul and his desire to be truly satisfied.
[time=1955] Next to contentment, you might wanna write, you might wanna write satisfaction, you might wanna write boldness.
[time=1962] Listen to this, Ecclesiastes chapter two, this is our friend Solomon.
[time=1968] Solomon, Ecclesiastes chapter two, listen to this.
[time=1972] And as I read this, I want you to sense, it won't be hard, believe me, it'll be very obvious.
[time=1976] I want you to get a sense for the direction of his pursuits.
[time=1981] How did you say that, the object?
[time=1985] - The object or the direction of his desires.
[time=1987] - Yeah, listen to this, listen till you can just see it.
[time=1989] It jumps off the page where he's going with this, what this is about, who this is about.
[time=1997] Ecclesiastes chapter two, verse four.
[time=1999] I enlarged my works, Solomon said.
[time=2002] I built houses for myself.
[time=2004] I planted vineyards for myself.
[time=2007] I made gardens and parks for myself, and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
[time=2013] In verse six, he goes on.
[time=2014] I made ponds of water for myself, from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees.
[time=2021] I bought male and female slaves, and I had home-born slaves.
[time=2025] Also, I possessed flocks and herds, larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.
[time=2032] Also, I collected from myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and provinces.
[time=2038] I provided for myself.
[time=2040] Now, you get in the gist of who this is for?
[time=2043] What this is about and whose empire he's trying to bring
[time=2049] and provided for myself, male and female singers, and the pleasures of men, many concubines.
[time=2057] I think there were about a thousand.
[time=2059] Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.
[time=2064] My wisdom also stood by me.
[time=2066] Now, look at verse 10.
[time=2068] All that my eyes desired, I did not refuse them.
[time=2071] Think about that.
[time=2072] I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, from my heart was pleased because of all my labor, and this was my reward for all my labor, verse 11.
[time=2082] Thus, I considered all my activities, which my hands had done, and the labor which I had exerted, and behold, all was, what?
[time=2093] Vanity, and striving after wind,
[time=2099] and there was no profit under the sun.
[time=2103] When it was all said and done, all the striving,
[time=2110] and all the building, and all the pleasure, and all the stuff that was supposed to come, and bring rest, and fullness, and satisfaction, and contentment to his soul, he says it's vanity.
[time=2127] I don't know what word comes to your mind when you hear me say the word vanity.
[time=2131] I think about empty.
[time=2133] I think about useless.
[time=2136] Pride seeks contentment from money.
[time=2141] The story of Solomon here shows how empty and dissatisfied he was.
[time=2145] You don't ever catch the wind, do you?
[time=2149] You are always left wanting.
[time=2153] Pride seeks contentment, and you all can fill in the blank.
[time=2159] What's the result?
[time=2160] It's just like significance.
[time=2162] What's the result?
[time=2164] Discontent.
[time=2165] Write it down.
[time=2166] Discontent.
[time=2168] Jesus said, many of you will remember this.
[time=2171] Jesus said, what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but loses his what?
[time=2178] His soul.
[time=2179] See, your soul and mine, they were made and designed by God to find contentment, to find peace, to find rest in him.
[time=2188] Not in cash, not in resources, not in possessions, not in acquisitions.
[time=2194] And for you and I, the opportunity is there, and we'll talk more about that next week, but just be reminded today that pride, when it gets going, it tries to find this thing that only God can provide, it tries to find contentment from money.
[time=2210] Thirdly, you know what?
[time=2213] We all know people, we all know people that have a lot and aren't content, and we all know people who have a lot and are content.
[time=2224] We all know people that have very little or nothing and are very content, and we know people who have nothing and are not content.
[time=2233] It's obvious that it doesn't depend on anything obvious, because in Philippians four, maybe we can talk about that next week, we know the secret to contentment.
[time=2244] - It all comes back to a heart condition and what the object of your desires or the direction of your desires are.
[time=2252] You know, a good eye or a clear eye, good eye and an IV, a clear eye was a focused, content, generous eye,
[time=2261] a heart, and they use that term.
[time=2263] A bad eye was a greedy, hard heart, selfish, discontent heart.
[time=2270] That's what Jesus is down at right in here.
[time=2274] And third, he talks about control, and I think you might want to consider memorizing this next verse.
[time=2280] Matthew 624 here in the Sermon of the Mount, Jesus now says, "No one can serve two masters." Let that sink in.
[time=2288] No one can serve two masters.
[time=2298] For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other.
[time=2306] And here's the biggie, "You cannot serve God and wealth.
[time=2312] "You cannot serve God and money.
[time=2315] "You cannot serve God and mammon." Big idea here, serving two masters is serving one.
[time=2323] Serving two masters is really serving one.
[time=2330] And I know because I lived it.
[time=2332] At age 18, I became the youngest realtor in the nation, and the Indianapolis star did a little article on it, and they quoted me as saying, "I wanted to be a billionaire by the time I'm 40, "and then tell everybody I was a Christian, "and I did that that way, and good guys can do it too." When I was 18, I wanted to be a thousand there.
[time=2351] (laughing) When I was 18, I wanted to weigh 200 pounds.
[time=2360] (laughing) When I was 19, I wanted hair.
[time=2366] (laughing) Where are we?
[time=2372] You wanted to be a billionaire.
[time=2374] In Indianapolis star.
[time=2375] And the quote.
[time=2377] (laughing) This is my head red.
[time=2381] So basically what I'm saying in that quote is, "I want to serve two masters." And for the next 10 years, I did it.
[time=2389] For the next 10 years of my life, I served two masters.
[time=2392] And you know what I learned?
[time=2394] Serving two masters is serving one.
[time=2396] And I did it because I wanted control of my life.
[time=2401] I wanted control of my life.
[time=2402] I saw that's what other people who had money had, and I wanted control of my life.
[time=2407] But control of my life with money as my master, and with God as my master.
[time=2412] At the end, only one was my master, and that was me, and that was money.
[time=2416] And my life was out of control.
[time=2420] Screwed up my family, my heart, people around me, my business.
[time=2429] Totally out of control, and lost it all.
[time=2433] (audience laughing) Girl, the baby sits for us.
[time=2437] She's on our team here.
[time=2439] I left my house last night, and was in an accident in total.
[time=2443] Her car and the car that hit her was total.
[time=2446] And so she called me right away, and I just took off, and I was gonna go to the accident site, and on my way there, I determined I'd better just go to the hospital and meet her there.
[time=2455] And she's okay, she banged up, she's okay.
[time=2458] But on my way there, I thought about my first accident.
[time=2462] I was on the snow.
[time=2464] How many people have had an accident on Snowrise?
[time=2466] Yeah.
[time=2467] And you know-- - And I've lived your 10 years, I haven't had one yet.
[time=2470] - Are you serious?
[time=2471] - Seriously.
[time=2472] - Oh, my goodness.
[time=2474] (audience laughing) - What's with all you people?
[time=2478] You can't drive in the snow?
[time=2479] - They think it's gonna happen to you today.
[time=2481] (audience laughing) - Oh, man.
[time=2483] The number eight car needs to get behind him and get him loose today, let him see.
[time=2487] Okay, so anyway, you know what that, now you know what I'm talking about?
[time=2491] No matter how tightly you hold onto that wheel of an out of control car, you're out of control.
[time=2499] No matter what, that car is out of control.
[time=2503] And that's exactly what happened in my life and what happens in yours.
[time=2507] No matter how tightly we try to control our lives apart from God, and in this case seeking money, apart from God, we live in a life that's totally out of control, totally out of control.
[time=2519] And Jesus says here, you can't serve two masters.
[time=2524] You weren't designed for that, back to Genesis.
[time=2528] You were designed to serve one.
[time=2531] And this is a control issue.
[time=2534] Serving two masters is serving one.
[time=2538] You cannot serve God and money.
[time=2542] - Man, that's good.
[time=2543] - You know, a prideful pursuit of significance
[time=2549] for your own sake, results in insignificance.
[time=2554] And a prideful pursuit of contentment, a selfish, self-gratifying contentment that results in discontentedness.
[time=2564] And a prideful pursuit of control results in being out of control.
[time=2570] And a prideful pursuit of security leads to insecurity.
[time=2578] You look for your security in anything that a moth and rust and thieves can grab hold of and destroy and you're in trouble.
[time=2591] But it's as natural as can be.
[time=2594] It's absolutely natural for me in my flesh to think that I'll feel more secure if I just have more of that.
[time=2603] More money, more things that money buys.
[time=2609] Matthew chapter six goes on.
[time=2611] And verse 25, you start to worry about that stuff.
[time=2616] If you have it, it's interesting.
[time=2618] The more you have, the more you worry.
[time=2621] And your security disappears.
[time=2625] He says, for this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life as to what you will eat or what you will drink nor for your body as to what you will put on.
[time=2634] It's not life more than food and the body more than clothing.
[time=2638] Look at the birds of the air that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them.
[time=2645] Are you not worth much more than they?
[time=2649] And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life?
[time=2655] And why are you worried about clothing?
[time=2657] Observe how the lilies of the field grow.
[time=2658] They do not toil nor do they spin.
[time=2661] Yet I say to you that not even Solomon, Kelly was reading about him, in all his glory, clothed himself like one of these.
[time=2669] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will he not much more clothe you, you of little faith?
[time=2681] Do not worry then saying what will we eat or what will we drink or what will we wear for clothing.
[time=2687] For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things.
[time=2692] For your heavenly father knows that you need all these things.
[time=2696] But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness.
[time=2701] And all these things will be added to you.
[time=2706] The problem is we do the mammon thing
[time=2712] that Mitchell was talking about.
[time=2714] We seek those things and we lose our security.
[time=2723] I know somebody who had a piece of property and he loved his piece of property so much
[time=2734] that every time he left his property, he spent a half hour preparing the property to look like he hadn't gone.
[time=2745] A radio on here, a newspaper out there, a television on in there, lights perfectly, the outside, the locks, locks, locks, locks, locks, locks, locks.
[time=2757] You get it, locks, locks, locks, all over the place.
[time=2760] Now I'm talking about going out to eat, not going away for a week.
[time=2766] When you have things, they rob you if you let them.
[time=2774] They don't have to.
[time=2778] In the first Timothy six, it says command those who are rich in this present world not to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides them with everything for their enjoyment.
[time=2791] If they're not worried about losing it, you can really enjoy it.
[time=2795] But when you're worried about losing it, when you've built up a pile around you so that you can feel more secure on this earth, the result is insecurity.
[time=2808] The rich young ruler, Mark chapter 10, walked up to Jesus and he said to him, what must I do to be saved?
[time=2818] And Jesus said, you know the rules and he told him.
[time=2821] He said them back to him.
[time=2822] He knew what he was supposed to do.
[time=2824] No adultery, no murder, keep the rules.
[time=2828] And Jesus said, one thing you haven't said that I want you to go do.
[time=2831] He said, I want you to go sell everything you have and come and follow me.
[time=2836] You know what, he didn't say that to every person.
[time=2839] Everybody doesn't have to do that.
[time=2841] That guy, his security, his control, his significance and his contentment were wrapped up in his wealth.
[time=2851] I know that because the next thing that happened was the Bible said, this is so sad.
[time=2856] The last words we hear in the Bible about this guy is he walked away sad because he had a lot of wealth.
[time=2865] Let me ask you this, today for him presently right now.
[time=2875] What's his wealth mean to him today?
[time=2888] Who or what?
[time=2893] Are you finding significance, contentment, control and security in?
[time=2900] We want you to think about that.
[time=2902] As you think about being a good steward of your treasure, understand the role that pride can play.
[time=2908] It can really move you and die away from the life and the experience and the opportunities that God has designed for us.
[time=2917] I'm going to invite a friend of ours to come on up to the stage.
[time=2920] Steve, would you help Carl up?
[time=2922] I want to introduce you to Carl Pearson, some of you left at this because he doesn't need help, it's a joke, but I'm really glad to be over here.
[time=2928] Some of you know Carl and Emily, they are a part of our family here, have been for a while.
[time=2933] And Carl is a good friend.
[time=2935] And while Carl's actually, while Carl's taking his seat, I want you to throw up that circle, Katie.
[time=2940] Would you do that?
[time=2941] While Carl's getting ready, I want you all to see, some of you are more visual, so there you have it.
[time=2946] There's a visual for you, if that helps you to look at it, you got pride in the middle and then just watch as the circle progresses.
[time=2952] When money is what, you're after there as it relates to those four desires, that's where it all ends up, out of control, insignificant, discontent, and insecure.
[time=2963] Next week, we're going to come back and look at the circle with Christ in the middle, and you will be amazed and encouraged by what you'll see when you're willing to really allow him to play that role.
[time=2974] Carl, good to see you, Carl.
[time=2976] I have known Carl for a number of years now, good to see you, my friend.
[time=2980] And he has been, this man has been, for me, a huge encouragement.
[time=2986] I'm so thankful for he and his wife, Emily, just went through a back surgery.
[time=2989] I think she's here today and feeling, no.
[time=2992] Thought you said she was here.
[time=2994] Oh, okay, she's not here.
[time=2995] But she's feeling better.
[time=2997] Somewhat, awesome, awesome.
[time=2999] Well, I've talked to Carl many times about stewardship and about resources.
[time=3005] And I know that many of you in the room today, I know that because it's the same with me, I know that we sometimes bring an approach,
[time=3020] we bring a mindset to this whole issue of money and resources.
[time=3026] And it's the mindset that we grew up with.
[time=3029] It's what we saw.
[time=3030] It's what got modeled for us.
[time=3032] And what we saw and what got modeled for us oftentimes dictates, in many cases, the way we function, the way we choose.
[time=3040] And I know because I've talked with Carl, I know how grateful he is for his father.
[time=3045] And I know how thankful he is for his mom and for the family experience that he had.
[time=3050] And as it relates to this issue of stewardship, I just wanted him to share briefly this morning his story.
[time=3057] It's an amazing story.
[time=3059] It's a story that not only just brings great encouragement, but I think for you and I today, we've got to listen.
[time=3064] We've got to listen to this because there is a lot of responsibility and a lot of opportunity that has been placed at your feet in mind as we raise up another generation of stewards.
[time=3079] And so I just want Carl to share with you briefly.
[time=3082] And I hope you'll be encouraged as he tells you a little bit about his life and the things that he learned as it relates to money and resources in the way we give him.
[time=3092] - Hi.
[time=3094] As Kelly said, my name is Carl Pearson, and I'm not part of the bird family.
[time=3099] - Stick that thing right in your mouth there.
[time=3101] - Okay.
[time=3102] - There you go.
[time=3103] - Stick it right in your mouth.
[time=3105] There you go.
[time=3106] - But I've always considered myself Kelly's who's your father with lots of fatherly advice.
[time=3113] Several weeks ago, while we were having breakfast, and I said, what gives with the giving at our church?
[time=3121] He said, I don't know.
[time=3123] I said, do you realize that if every person attending Black Hawk, young and old, would tithe, we would never be in the red?
[time=3134] I then shared with him the following story about my father.
[time=3140] He asked if I would share this with you this morning and said I could take three to five minutes.
[time=3148] And he said, if I went beyond, he'd just pull his collar and they turn it off upstairs.
[time=3155] Those of you who know me know I'm a talker, so I wrote out what I want to share.
[time=3161] - And let me say this before he goes on.
[time=3163] For many of you in the room, you understand the phrase, the tithe.
[time=3166] In the Old Testament, we see this idea of the tithe.
[time=3170] And it is a concept that has kind of stayed with us in the church for years and years and years.
[time=3177] And the idea there is a 10% gift.
[time=3181] And while today we still believe that the tithe principle is a good and healthy principle.
[time=3189] In the New Testament, we see God's word clearly stating that we're to be willing to give sacrificially on a regular basis.
[time=3198] And so in our church today and here, as we teach and as we try and communicate about this, there isn't anything at all wrong with the idea of the tithe.
[time=3206] It is a good gauge.
[time=3208] It is a good beginning point.
[time=3210] And as Carl shares this with you, I want you to kind of keep that in mind.
[time=3214] It is a great beginning point.
[time=3217] It is a good gauge for you and I as we think about our willingness to give.
[time=3221] Tell 'em your story.
[time=3223] - In 1927, my father and mother lost three farms in Iowa when the crash hit the farm area first.
[time=3234] Dad moved to Chicago with a wife, three daughters, and a hundred dollars.
[time=3240] He took a job as a streetcar conductor.
[time=3243] In 1929, I was born.
[time=3246] We lived on the third floor of an apartment building
[time=3252] that today would be considered a tenement building.
[time=3255] We were not wealthy.
[time=3256] A lady watching three little girls playing as my mother,
[time=3262] if she could take them to Sunday school.
[time=3265] My mother said, "Yes, as long as she could go with them." And it was in Chicago where my father and mother met the Lord, which changed their lives completely.
[time=3277] Due to the crash of '29, the Chicago streetcar company always paid salaries by cash, never by check.
[time=3287] As a young boy, I remembered seeing my dad.
[time=3290] On payday, take his pay envelope and count out his 10% which he considered his tithe to the Lord and placing it in the church envelope before anything else was paid for or purchased.
[time=3307] This he did first with every pay envelope as his first fruits of his labor.
[time=3315] We learned that God provided for our needs, never our greed.
[time=3322] - You told me you remember, as a boy, knowing your dad didn't make much, you would watch him do that every other week and you knew there wasn't much left, but you told me that you remember your mom and dad inviting people over for meals.
[time=3340] Talk about that. - We never had a table that did not have somebody sitting at our table in the evening sharing the food, always, always.
[time=3350] - That's amazing.
[time=3351] - Well, here in Fort Wayne, my family attended Emmanuel Baptist Church and those of that you don't, that don't know it was the mother church of Blackhawk.
[time=3363] And our pastor, Tom Younger, would encourage people who had never tied to give to the Lord.
[time=3371] He would say, try this for six months and see how far your money goes.
[time=3376] And let me just say this, we all hear the story of salvation and in except Christ is our savior.
[time=3386] Now it's time to trust him.
[time=3388] You can't out give the Lord.
[time=3391] - Amen, thank you Carl very much.
[time=3395] Would you guys come on back over here and we'll pray.
[time=3399] If you would just stand with us this morning, let's close in a word of prayer.
[time=3406] Father God, thank you so very much.
[time=3408] Thank you for Carl and Emily and many, many others in this room right here this morning and many others who are a part of this family.
[time=3417] Many others who have lived life with you God for years and years and years and in doing so God, they have provided people like us, the rest of us.
[time=3428] They have provided us a great legacy.
[time=3429] They have provided an example of faithfulness and trust.
[time=3433] And God, I pray that every person in this room this morning that we would identify, that we would be willing to admit the temptation to allow pride to rest at the center of our financial mindsets, our giving habits, our saving, our spending.
[time=3455] God, as we admit that at the same time, God, I pray that every person in this room would also admit that you have given us another option.
[time=3463] You have given us this amazing relationship with your son.
[time=3466] You have allowed for us to find true and meaningful significance and contentment and control and security and relationship with you.
[time=3475] And God, would you please move us more and more in that direction?
[time=3479] And may we trust you, as Carl mentioned.
[time=3482] May we trust you with that which you have given.
[time=3484] May we trust you with that which is yours in the first place.
[time=3489] And God, as we do that, may you grow our hearts.
[time=3492] Hearts that are willing to steward all that you've given us.
[time=3496] Lives that are willing.
[time=3498] Lives that are willing to live completely and absolutely
[time=3504] with great conviction for you.
[time=3506] And God, as you do this work in us, we will be so grateful.
[time=3511] We look forward to the opportunity, God, to be together again soon.
[time=3514] We thank you so very much for this life that you've given us.
[time=3518] And we pray, God, that we would live it well.
[time=3521] In your son's name we pray.
[time=3523] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3548] (upbeat music)
