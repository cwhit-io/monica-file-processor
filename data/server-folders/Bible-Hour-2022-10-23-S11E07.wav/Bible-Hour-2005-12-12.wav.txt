[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=55] and on earth.
[time=62] Therefore go and make disciples of almost, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit."
[time=77] Teaching them to observe all I have to command you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=83] end of the age.
[time=88] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=95] Hi, I'm Mitch, a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and as you can see I'm
[time=105] amidst our Christmas with Black Hawk set, and we still have two performances remaining today at 3.30 and tonight at 7.30.
[time=113] So please just come, even if you don't have tickets, we'll do our best to find a seat for you.
[time=118] It's really a compelling presentation of Christmas.
[time=123] And so please come, Christmas with Black Hawk, word on the street, and you'll love the fact that you did today at 3.30 and tonight at 7.30.
[time=131] Also I'd like to invite you to our Christmas Eve services at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Christmas
[time=137] Eve on Saturday at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. and to our Christmas Day service, if you don't attend
[time=143] a local church or your church is not meeting that particular morning on Christmas Day,
[time=149] December 25th Sunday we'll be here at 10 a.m. we'll have about an hour long service, so you're all invited to come to that and we hope to see you there.
[time=158] Also I'd like to invite you to our common ground services, that's our Wednesday night worship services, it's from 6.45 to 8.15, we will not be meeting the 21st and the 28th, but we'll
[time=169] resume in the new year every Wednesday night.
[time=172] It's just a great feel of worship, of prayer time, of sharing of stories, of teaching the Bible and it's authentic, it's relaxed, it's purposeful, and it's just fun.
[time=184] We have a really good time on Wednesday night, 6.45 to 8.15, but not December 21st and December
[time=190] 28th.
[time=191] Well what you're about to see is our message on how's your life, how's your life really,
[time=202] and Kelly had focused on time and on talent in the last two weeks including this one we're focusing on treasures and we see that in Genesis God I think put in us four desires.
[time=214] He created us with four desires, one for significance being made in his image, one for contentment
[time=221] being blessed by God and being commanded by him to multiply, to be content enough to give
[time=227] and bring peace to the earth, so for significance, for contentment, for control.
[time=233] God says in Genesis you rule over the earth and one also for security, says in Genesis
[time=239] that God gave man everything to live.
[time=242] It comes from the gift of God, control comes from his authority.
[time=246] So we fast forward to the Sermon on the Mount and we see Jesus addressing these four desires and how a hard heart, a proud heart, seeks money as fulfillment of those desires and
[time=258] you'll see that we'll talk about it's kind of like a wheel where we go to the outside of the wheel, try to cover more ground, faster and make life all about us and since that first
[time=267] sin in the garden by choice and by birth we have these hard hearts that seek fulfillment
[time=274] of the desires oftentimes in money.
[time=277] But it is a heart condition, whether you have money or you don't you can still have a heart condition that either honors God or doesn't honor God, a heart that does not honor God is proud, it tries to find satisfaction of the desires in money apart from God.
[time=293] A humble heart however, finds satisfaction of its desires in Christ and we'll see that
[time=299] Christ's love satisfies our desire for significance and it frees us up to use money and to use
[time=306] our time, talent and treasures in a way that honors God and serves others.
[time=311] We'll see that when we surrender our heart to Christ that our desire for contentment is
[time=317] found in His peace and it frees us up to bring that peace to others.
[time=322] When we surrender our desire for control to Him in our weakness we become strong and we
[time=328] experience the power of God in Jesus Christ and it frees us up to serve others again and to honor God.
[time=334] And then finally when we surrender our desire for security to Christ and He satisfies that desire in His truth as you'll hear that He's the only entities, the only person who's true
[time=346] all the time, truth is a person and then that frees us up once again to minister to others
[time=352] and to honor God.
[time=353] Now we're going to see four key things that Jesus says that we should do out of our heart condition.
[time=358] It's evidence of the heart condition that He desires a humble heart and He says this in
[time=364] the sermon on the Mount.
[time=365] Last week we talked about what a proud heart looks like.
[time=368] This week you're going to hear what a humble heart looks like.
[time=370] Again, it doesn't matter if you have a gazillion dollars or you have nothing.
[time=374] Your heart when it comes to resources, to treasures, might honor God and it might not and the key is this and you'll hear it a couple times in the message.
[time=382] The key is this.
[time=384] What is the object of my desires?
[time=390] That's evidence in what my heart condition really is.
[time=395] A proud heart, the object of its desires, the direction of its desires is myself and that's
[time=403] evidence in this culture and money.
[time=404] It's going to the outside of the wheel you'll see in the illustration.
[time=408] But a humble heart, its desires are directed toward Christ.
[time=413] And that's the only place that our hearts will find satisfaction.
[time=419] And it's just amazing how that humility toward Christ frees us up to live in humility toward others.
[time=425] And it's amazing what God does with that.
[time=429] So grab a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate and join us and engage in the message and I just would encourage you to examine your own heart and ask yourself this simple question.
[time=439] What's the object of my heart's desires?
[time=442] Is it me or is it Christ?
[time=445] Merry Christmas.
[time=472] Oh, little town of Jerusalem, looks like another silent night.
[time=496] That Father gave His only Son the way the truth, the life had come, but there was no room for
[time=510] Him.
[time=511] In this world He came to sing Jerusalem, a gift of history as a city with the Lord for His
[time=524] King.
[time=527] Jerusalem, what you have missed while you were sleeping, the Savior of the Lord is dying
[time=536] on your cross today.
[time=540] Jerusalem, you will go down in history as a city with the Lord for His King.
[time=550] While you were sleeping, while you were sleeping.
[time=567] The United States of America looks like another silent night.
[time=581] As was sung to sleep by philosophies that saved the trees and to the children.
[time=593] And while we're lying in the dark, there's a shout her cross the eastern sky.
[time=606] For the bridegroom has returned and has carried his bride away in the night, in the night.
[time=617] America, what will we miss while we were sleeping, will Jesus come again and leave us slumber
[time=628] in where we lay.
[time=631] America, what will we go down in history as a nation with the Lord for His King, while
[time=642] we were sleeping, while we were sleeping, the United States of America looks like another
[time=663] silent night.
[time=676] Thank you, PT.
[time=677] Thank you so much.
[time=678] Thank you, Corbett and team.
[time=680] What a great morning.
[time=681] It's been already.
[time=682] I see a few more of you have made it in from the snow and again we want to say welcome to you.
[time=688] It's great to be together.
[time=689] And this is Mitchell Cruz next to me.
[time=691] My name's Kelly and we are so thankful both Mitchell and I.
[time=695] We get to be a part of an amazing team of people, a great family that he is building
[time=701] here in this place.
[time=702] We're so thankful for the ministry that takes place here.
[time=705] So thankful for you and the role that you all play and it is good to be together.
[time=710] For the last five, six weeks or so, we have been asking you a question.
[time=715] And today we come to the conclusion of this little series that we've been, that we've been a part of, this teaching, this discussion that we've been in over the last several weeks and the title of this series and the question that we've been asking is, "How's your life?"
[time=730] And we want to ask you again this morning.
[time=734] One more time for now at least.
[time=738] How's your life?
[time=740] Not so much circumstantially, not how is it at work, not the trials or the pressures or the joys that you might be facing.
[time=747] We can talk about that and we can delve into that later.
[time=750] But in this discussion and in these last several weeks we've been asking the question, "What are you doing with your life?" I mean, really.
[time=760] What are you prioritizing?
[time=762] What are you valuing?
[time=764] What are you giving yourself to in the everyday of life?
[time=767] I mean really, what gets you up early, what keeps you up late, what is it in the day-to-day of your existence that you are giving yourself to?
[time=778] Everybody's got a life song.
[time=779] We've been hearing that song, Corbin's been singing that as the weeks have gone by and
[time=785] your lyric and mine, these life songs that we have, they say something.
[time=791] They point us in a direction, "What are you doing?
[time=795] Where are you going?
[time=797] And why?
[time=798] What rests at the foundation of your life journey today?
[time=803] How is your life?" In recent weeks we've taken this question about our life and what we're doing with it and we've kind of connected that to this biblical concept of stewardship, stewardship as we've
[time=816] defined it, you and I being faithful, persistent, consistent, regular, dependable, trustworthy,
[time=825] being faithful and God honoring in the use of all that He has given us, everything from
[time=832] the possessions to the relationships to the breath you just took.
[time=837] We've talked about being excellent stewards of our time and our talent and our treasure.
[time=846] And last week we came to the first part in this discussion of treasure, how you and I
[time=852] will faithfully steward the treasure that God has entrusted to you.
[time=856] You say, "Well, He didn't give me much treasure." Well, last week we took care of that.
[time=860] We made sure that in this discussion, in this teaching, in this look at God's word, it wasn't going to be about amounts because God's word doesn't make it about amounts.
[time=869] God may have given you a 6.50 an hour job.
[time=872] God may have provided you with 28.5 a year.
[time=876] You may make 300,000, it doesn't matter.
[time=879] Scripture points to the condition of your heart in the midst of whatever treasure He's provided
[time=887] you and He asks you and it calls you and I to steward it well.
[time=894] And so last week, as Steve and Mitch and I came to this discussion of our treasure,
[time=900] Mitch took us to Genesis and he's going to take you there again this morning just to kind of catch you up.
[time=904] It's there in Genesis that we see as it relates to all of life and especially this discussion of treasure, these four God-given universal desires, four God-given universal desires.
[time=918] We've all got it.
[time=919] It's in each of us.
[time=921] God put it there.
[time=922] And the way we respond to and the way we view these desires says a great deal about the way we live life and about the way we, more specifically in today's discussion, handle our treasures.
[time=933] Mitch, take us back to Genesis if you will.
[time=936] Genesis 127 through 30, if you want to turn there on your Bibles or we'll come up on the screen.
[time=941] And the first desire that I believe we see is significance.
[time=945] Says God created man in His own image and the image of God He created him, male and female He created them.
[time=952] Our desire for significance is fulfilled in the fact that we are created in God's image and are we going to surrender our desires to God because the condition of the heart is
[time=963] evidence in the direction of my desires.
[time=966] The condition of my heart is evidence in the direction of my desires.
[time=970] And so my desires, when my heart desires God, I see that significance is found in the fact
[time=978] that He created me in His image and some other things we're going to talk about as well.
[time=982] Second, we'll see that the desire for contentment is here from God and Genesis.
[time=990] God bless them and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it." Contentment comes from the blessing of God, from the blessing of God.
[time=1001] And He says, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
[time=1004] Be content enough to give and subdue it." Subdue it in Hebrew is kabosh, we've made it a negative term in our culture but it literally
[time=1014] means to bring peace or contentment to the earth.
[time=1017] So the desire for significance being created in God's image, we have the desire for contentment from the blessing of God and we have the desire of control.
[time=1025] God said by His authority, you rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
[time=1033] This desire for control came from God.
[time=1035] God says you do it and it's from the authority of God that He gives us this control.
[time=1041] And then finally the desire for security.
[time=1043] Then God said, "Be whole, I've given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth and every tree which has fruit yielding seed.
[time=1051] It shall be food for you and for every beast of the earth and every bird of the sky and
[time=1061] everything that moves on the earth which has life.
[time=1063] I've given every green plant for food and it was so.
[time=1067] Security comes from the gift of God.
[time=1070] But then in Genesis 3 for the first time we watch humble hearts go proud.
[time=1075] And for the first time the direction of their desires are not going to be God, it's going to be me.
[time=1080] It's going to be pride.
[time=1081] They're going to do it a selfish gratification of their own desires.
[time=1084] They won't use them to glorify God.
[time=1087] They're going to use them to glorify themselves and so ever since then we by birth and by choice have proud hearts and it's like a wheel where we try to go to the outside of the wheel and cover more ground faster and this hurry in our lives that really is a heart condition
[time=1102] is evidence in every part of our life.
[time=1103] And so we go to the outside of the wheel with pride and we try to seek significance.
[time=1108] We try to seek significance apart from God and we do it with money.
[time=1111] Money tends to be pride's measurement of our giftedness.
[time=1118] And so we go the outside of the wheel and the irony of it is the more I try to seek significance in money or whatever it is apart from God the more insignificant I will feel.
[time=1125] The more I seek contentment in money apart from God the more discontent I will become.
[time=1132] The more I seek security apart from God from money the more insecure I will become.
[time=1139] And the more I seek control of my life from money apart from God the more out of control my life becomes.
[time=1147] Money is pride's measurement of our giftedness.
[time=1153] But God desires it a different way and it's a shift in the direction of our desires.
[time=1159] It's back in essence to Genesis.
[time=1161] Back to Genesis and back to the original design which would be a fully surrendered heart
[time=1167] and life.
[time=1168] A fully surrendered, a fully devoted heart and life to the person of Jesus Christ and you see when you and I in that relationship are able to experience Christ centrally located
[time=1179] right there in the middle and thick of it all.
[time=1182] It's amazing.
[time=1183] I'm going to see this this morning.
[time=1184] Mitch and I want to just before we get into our outline which you'll see there on your bulletin before we get there.
[time=1189] We just want you to see and take in the sheer reality of what happens with these four desires
[time=1196] when you and I come into that life changing eternity altering relationship with Jesus
[time=1202] Christ.
[time=1203] We want you to see how a fully surrendered life what it looks like when it intersects with these four desires.
[time=1210] And first of all you'll see there let's just look at significance.
[time=1214] When significance is found you might want to write this down somewhere else.
[time=1217] When significance this is good truth for all of us.
[time=1221] When significance is found in Christ and you can write down John 3 16.
[time=1226] Look what the screen says.
[time=1228] We experience the love of God.
[time=1234] Understand this my friends there is in every one of us in this room the desire for significance.
[time=1239] We want to feel down deep in us as if there is something significant and prominent about
[time=1245] us in our experience.
[time=1247] You see God designed us that way and he designed us to feel that significance in him.
[time=1253] And when we come into that relationship with Christ here's the deal you and I have to remember that he gave his son John 3 16 he gave his son so that you and I could experience the
[time=1266] significance and the love of God the Father.
[time=1269] How much more significant did you want to feel.
[time=1275] And where else were you going to find anything?
[time=1279] Where else were you going to purchase something?
[time=1283] What is it that you were going to acquire but somehow was going to bring a deeper sense
[time=1289] of significance to your life than the fact that God in heaven sent his son so he could
[time=1295] have a relationship with you.
[time=1299] When significance is found in Christ we experience the love of God.
[time=1303] Christ is the love of God.
[time=1304] If you want on your blank under number one where it says the result right in there the love of God in Christ right by the blank beside result right in there the love of God in Christ.
[time=1314] Christ is the love of God.
[time=1316] Second thing we find is that contentment when contentment is found in Christ through a humble heart because Christ is the object of my desires then I experience the peace of God if you want
[time=1327] to write that in the peace of God in Christ on number two under the result the peace of God in Christ and it's because Christ is the peace of God.
[time=1335] Christ is the love of God it's who he is Christ is the peace of God it's who he is Christ is the peace of God and we experience that when he is the object of our desires Ephesians
[time=1346] 2 14 says he himself is our peace he has reconciled us to the Father and he has provided peace
[time=1353] to exist in our relationships with each other.
[time=1357] When significance is found in Christ we experience the love of God when contentment is found
[time=1363] in him we experience the peace of God in Christ.
[time=1366] Thirdly look at that when control is found in Christ right down 1 Corinthians 1 24 1
[time=1373] 1 Corinthians 1 24 when control that God given desire for that is experienced or found
[time=1379] in Christ we experience the power of God.
[time=1383] 1 Corinthians 1 24 says but to those who are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power
[time=1390] of God you see it and I see it all the time people groping for it people looking for it
[time=1396] people searching for it they want that sense of power they want to be able to impact and
[time=1402] you and I what we find out and realize is we can't do it in and of ourselves in relationship with him we receive and we have access to the power of God made manifest in the person
[time=1415] of Christ our Savior and Lord.
[time=1418] So when significant is found in Christ we experience the love of God when contentment is found in Christ we experience the peace of God when control is found in Christ we experience the power of God and finally when security is found in Christ we experience the truth of
[time=1434] God John 14 6 Jesus said I am the truth and security seeks something that is true all the
[time=1443] time a foundation that's absolutely sure will never change and truth is a person truth
[time=1449] is not some idea not some concept truth is Jesus Christ and that's what I where I was
[time=1455] divine to find where I was designed to find my security God designed it this way and so Christ it's what Psalm 145 16 says Christ God satisfies my desires and the more this
[time=1469] is last week's message the more with a proud heart I make myself or I make money the object
[time=1475] of my desires and more dissatisfied I will be I'll still be thirsty I'll still be hungry
[time=1483] I'll be greedy everything we talked about last week but when Christ is the object of my desires only he satisfies these desires that God put there truth is a person before Mitch goes
[time=1497] on I just got to say this I didn't really this didn't come to me first hour but I'm sitting here looking at the screen and it's a little off subject but in a way it's very it's very on I just want you to look at that screen and I want to just shift your attention just for a moment to marriage and if you look at that screen I just want to remind you men
[time=1520] women you know we could probably take some time here and kind of divvy up the four and assign them to different ones of us but we won't do that I'll just make sure that as a spouse if you're here in this room today significance security contentment is not designed
[time=1541] by God is not meant to be found or experienced in him little age or her and yet I'm here
[time=1551] to tell you that for 18 years of it marriage I have been I have been having to be I have
[time=1558] had to be reminded of that truth again and again and again and young people I want to remind you you've been you've been in many ways sold a bill of goods because sometimes in your minds and it's come from a lot of different directions but sometimes in the mind of a 17 18 19 20 year old you're thinking somehow if you can find that guy or somehow
[time=1578] if you can find that gal all of a sudden you'll be significant all of a sudden you'll be content all of a sudden you'll be in control all of a sudden you'll be secure and no human being
[time=1590] man or woman was ever designed to meet those needs in you you were designed by God to have
[time=1596] those needs met in Christ so that you could be freed up to go and love a spouse unconditionally
[time=1604] and that's what God calls us to sorry for the diversion it's beautiful I just want you
[time=1611] to get this and I don't want you to miss this everything we're talking about it's about a heart condition and my heart condition is either proud or humble and my heart condition
[time=1621] is evidenced in the direction of my desires my desires are about me or money that's a
[time=1627] proud heart if my desires are about Christ that's a humble heart humility is lowering
[time=1636] my position to something and we all do that so there's irony there to something but God's
[time=1644] designed it so that we would humble our hearts to Christ he is the satisfaction of our desires and money is pride's measurement of our giftedness but wisdom wisdom is humility's measurement
[time=1659] of our godliness and we're gonna see that unfold through here that wisdom is humility's
[time=1665] measurement of our godliness and so if you want to turn to Matthew six we're gonna go
[time=1671] through the passage again that we went through last week now seeing what a humble heart what Kelly just said what a humble heart in Christ is free to do okay so turn to Matthew six
[time=1683] Jesus on the storm of the Mount probably is 20,000 people around him and I'm gonna start up in verses six chapter six verses 19 to 21 and Jesus says do not store up for yourselves
[time=1695] treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but store
[time=1702] it for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves
[time=1708] do not break in and steal look what humility does humility if you want to write it in stores
[time=1717] up treasures in heaven not on earth like we talked about last week but humility stores
[time=1723] up treasures in heaven and yes you can do it with money we'll talk about that if I don't
[time=1729] remind me and the result is the love of God in Christ what are treasures in heaven it's
[time=1737] just great discussion about it but there are really only two things are eternal and that's
[time=1743] the word of God and the souls of men so I believe that it's relationships that's treasures
[time=1750] in heaven are relationships and so what Jesus is saying is it's never been about storing
[time=1757] up the stuff in fact I go the opposite direction Jesus says I want you to store up relationships
[time=1767] and let the stuff just be the stuff nothing wrong with owning the stuff but when the stuff
[time=1776] owns you there is a problem and so Jesus is asking to say we got a choice when it comes
[time=1782] to money we're going to store up the stuff or we're going to store up relationships and
[time=1788] maybe how about this use the stuff use the money to be relational to love people to build
[time=1797] relationships and you know it's true it's what Kelly saying it's true in marriage try to
[time=1804] store up stuff start the relationship love love the husband loved the why it's true as a parent it's true as a child back to the parent but you know where it's also true it's
[time=1816] true every single place you go God's designer there would be about the relationship not
[time=1823] about the stuff wherever you work this is the way God's designed it it's amazing to me
[time=1830] money really is in business and in our economy a byproduct of the relationship it's the way
[time=1836] God designed it if you make it about the money then you're going to be insignificant you're
[time=1842] going to be thirsty you're going to be hungry you will be dissatisfied and it will not work it's a short term plan I know because I've lived it but when you make Christ the object
[time=1853] of your desires and he fulfills he fulfills that desire for significance in his love then
[time=1862] you're free you're free to be relational and you don't have to you don't have to win the money money's a byproduct of a relationship I tell you where this really rang true for me is amazing story to me is I was sitting across the desk from a from the conference
[time=1879] room table from the co-founder of eBay and here he is telling me about the story of his
[time=1885] company and I'm really struggling with a stock that I'm going to receive for my all
[time=1893] my livelihood I'm going to receive all their stock for my company and it really bothered me I said I just got to ask you something I said you have 97% of the auction internet auction market and your stock has just gone through the roof I guess got to ask your question
[time=1909] what keeps Microsoft who's a gazillion times bigger than you from flicking you off the screen and owning the auction market and the answer he gave me really really impacted my
[time=1923] life he said well it's easy Mitch he said we're about love relationships and community I said
[time=1931] what he says we're not about the money we're about love relationships and community I said
[time=1937] what are you talking about he says let me tell you a story he said there was this lady who was trading I think she wasn't from Idaho and she was buying and selling antiques and he said we believe in relationships love community and he said one day she kind of disappeared
[time=1953] and after about 30 days of not being around the people who traded with her most often
[time=1959] started they really had to investigate and see what was going on and so they discovered that she had a husband who basically discarded her threw her out took everything from her
[time=1969] and she was just left alone penniless he says Mitchell those guys went together bought
[time=1976] her a computer got her back on the internet and got her enough stuff to get going again and he says Mitchell no amount of money can ever buy that and I want to tell you today
[time=1988] no amount of money will ever buy your significance you will always leave feeling insignificant
[time=1994] you'll want more but only Christ you it's how you were hardwired hardwired only Christ
[time=2001] only Christ will fulfill that desire for significance and when he does when you humble your heart to him you are free to store up to store treasures in heaven to be relational
[time=2013] to love other people Proverbs 1922 says what a man desires really is unfailing love and
[time=2019] you're only going to get it in one place and that's Jesus Christ so what would it look like for you to be free to realize this truth and be free and be relational and yes relational
[time=2030] use your money to be relational what would that look like for you well said well said
[time=2036] number two follow us along on the outline if you will when contentment let's go to that desire when contentment your pursuit of it in mind when contentment is found in relationship
[time=2048] with Christ write this down humility gives go ahead and write it down humility gives
[time=2055] with money it really does look at our text back in Matthew if you will says in Matthew six twenty two the eye is the lamp on this issue of contentment the eye is the lamp of
[time=2068] the body so then if your eye is clear I think in the niv it says if it's a good eye if your
[time=2075] eye is clear your whole body will be full of light Mitchell described that for us last week that good eye or that that clear eye in this text in the context of this day in
[time=2085] the Jewish culture that referred to an eye that referred to a heart that referred to a life that was gracious that was gracious and willing to extend graciousness because
[time=2096] of the contentment that it was experiencing Mitchell made a great point first hour listen to this in the NIV it says a good eye he made a great connection I wanted to share it with
[time=2107] you with the good eye and the contentment thing I think I thought about it sometime this week that a good eye was a it's a content eye a focused eye a generous eye and I got to think
[time=2117] and we've used that term today in our culture when a girl steps up to the softball plate or a guy steps up to the baseball plate and he lets a pitch go by because he's content enough to know that that wasn't a good pitch we all yell what good eye good eye and that's the
[time=2133] same concept and that's what Jesus is saying here be content enough be focused enough to let this this this discontentment go by listen to this now contentment okay I don't know again
[time=2145] what word comes to your mind I want to give you a few just to kind of have in your in your in your mind's eye as we think through this let me just have you write this down or think about full
[time=2155] fullness or think about satisfied fullness or satisfied when I find contentment in Christ
[time=2165] I am full and watch how this works I'm going to appeal to I know many of you in the room I know
[time=2172] a lot of you enjoy a good meal raise your hand if you enjoy a good meal all right thank you amen I want to just appeal to your your appetite you may want to go back to Thanksgiving just
[time=2182] you know a week or so ago you may want to go forward to Christmas Eve or or you may just want to think
[time=2188] about that that meal that you love and maybe it's maybe it's not a full meal maybe it's a special piece of pie maybe it's a cake somebody makes but I just want you to think about that feeling
[time=2199] that sense that you and I get when we are full when we have sat down to that meal and I'm not
[time=2206] talking that feeling that we get when we're full like sick full okay not not going over the line
[time=2212] that far but just right at that line you with me not the sick full but the wow that's good full
[time=2221] right you're full and it's been enjoyable and it's been fun and it's it's met that need and
[time=2227] you're just perfect you're just you're full right I've seen that expressing a lot yeah thanks
[time=2234] now listen listen listen when you get that way when you're full
[time=2240] guess what it leads to I'll I'll I'll give you an example from this past Wednesday I could give
[time=2249] you an example from our table at home I mean you and I we see this all the time I would suspect with kids and and adults we have breakfast every Wednesday Mitchell and Steve Longbreak and I and
[time=2260] Ed and Doug and sometimes other guys join us but Wednesday we're always over there at cosmos cosmos on Colosseum or or cosmos House of Pancakes up there on Saint Joe and Saint Joe Center and I'll tell you what they've got this multi-grain pancake oh my I'm at the House of
[time=2276] Pancakes the one up on Saint Joe and Saint Joe Center it's the best pancake oh you can't describe it's kind of like a cinnamon flavor really really good so watch this I'm trying to like kind of hold back on the whole pancake thing right so I go in there and do my eggs and my bacon he has the pancake one but he had the eggs with one big pancake he has the eggs and bacon and he gets a little what say it full he's a little full so we're talking everybody's talking and Mitch and I
[time=2302] have a conversation and he notices and I do this sometimes I'm sorry but I'm looking at his eyes when we're talking but then my eyes go to the pancake and then my eyes will be back on him and then my eyes will go to the pancake I just couldn't get the pancake out of my mind because I wasn't what right and it had powdered sugar on it and just the right amount of syrup oh yeah are you
[time=2322] with me I'm telling Mitch Mitch is full and he sees that look in my eye he sees a brother in need
[time=2331] right and I'm telling you I didn't say a word he just mid-sentence he just picks his plate up
[time=2338] reaches over slapped that baby on my plate puts his plate back down we don't stop talking I don't
[time=2344] miss a beat I cut into that baby I offered you my best that's right hey my friends when you're
[time=2351] full you give you're satisfied not with stuff not with what you drive not with how much you make
[time=2366] not with toys not with vacation destinations no no no when you are full in that life-changing
[time=2374] relationship with Christ he places in you a giving and gracious spirit born out of contentment
[time=2382] a satisfaction like absolutely none other it is an amazing thing look at second Timothy
[time=2391] excuse me look at first Timothy look at first Timothy chapter six write this down first Timothy six six through ten watch this progression it's amazing but godliness actually is a means of great
[time=2402] gain when accompanied by say it out loud by contentment for we have brought nothing into
[time=2410] the world so we cannot take anything out of it either he goes on in verse eight if we have food
[time=2417] and covering with these we shall be say it goes on in verse nine to say but those who want to get
[time=2425] rich fall into temptation you see it right here they fall into temptation and a snare and many
[time=2431] foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction but there it is there it is
[time=2438] desires that's right verse ten for the love of money not money the love of money is a root
[time=2447] of all sorts of evil and some by longing for it there it is some by longing for it for the money
[time=2454] instead of Christ have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs
[time=2462] you can't take it with you it's the it's the you don't see a u-hall behind a Hearst passage
[time=2470] and I've been around some funerals in my day and there have been many a many a situation when I
[time=2482] have found myself the over at McCombs or somewhere else and the the folks are gathering and we're
[time=2489] in that room and I'll tell you what I can't remember the last time that that family came
[time=2496] together and put out on display that guy's financial portfolio I've never seen that once
[time=2504] but I'll tell you what I have seen they're in frames they're called what pictures and who's in
[time=2512] the pictures people relationships and praise God for those men and women who we've gathered to
[time=2522] celebrate who figured that out at some point in time and they gave themselves completely
[time=2528] not to some worldly measure of success but they gave themselves to Christ and in that
[time=2535] found great contentment and great joy please please don't miss it do you get filled up or
[time=2541] satisfied by a purchase let's just be real practical here do you get filled up or satisfied by a
[time=2548] purchase do you get filled up or satisfied by a good day on the stock market do you get filled up
[time=2554] or satisfied by a raise from 725 to 750 think about it it's okay to be thankful
[time=2565] it's okay to be thankful for these things but not content do not for a moment allow
[time=2573] your fullness to come from any of the above allow that to come from the one who God designed you
[time=2580] to experience it with the person of Christ amen you know I've been thinking as you're talking
[time=2589] back to Genesis God blessed them and you know told them to be content enough to multiply
[time=2597] and to bring peace to the earth I'm convinced that we're not content enough to give unless we see that what we've been given was from the blessing of God and that he replenishes that we tend to think that's all we're going to get or something and so we're not content enough to give but when we recognize that what we have comes from the blessing of God it's his blessing then I think
[time=2618] we experience what Paul wrote in Philippians 4 12 and 13 he says I know the secret to contentment he says you know I've lost a lot of stuff I've had a lot of stuff but I know that
[time=2629] the secret to contentment is this I get to do all things through Christ that's good
[time=2635] now you can see it right there on the screen first 13 I can do all things through him
[time=2643] who strengthens me well humility stores up treasures in heaven humility gives and third we're going
[time=2655] to see humility serves if you want to write that in humility serves with money and the result is the power of God in Christ Matthew 6 verse 24 Jesus says no one can serve two masters we talked about
[time=2666] this last week no one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to one and despise the other you cannot serve God and wealth you cannot serve God and money serving two masters is serving one is what he's saying we have been designed to
[time=2683] serve one master that's how we're designed and so the object of our desires once again it's either
[time=2689] going to be me or money or whatever that gets manifested in a proud heart or it's going to be Christ I'm going to serve one or the other and so what's that look like for us to serve with this
[time=2701] authority that God has given us he's given us this control and he's asked us to serve you know it
[time=2708] kind of looks like this I think a synchronous 12 9 and 10 talks about in my weakness I'm strong he said there it is he says he said to me my grace is sufficient for you it's enough for power is perfected in weakness there's this idea that when there's less of me there's more of him most gladly therefore I'll rather boast about my weakness so that the power of Christ may dwell in me look at that look at that go back to verse nine look at
[time=2734] that I will rather boast about my weakness so that the power of Christ may dwell in me when I humble
[time=2745] myself to Christ there's this power there's this power of Christ manifested in my life and in my
[time=2754] relationships and we see it when we serve you can go and do the next verse then and therefore I'm
[time=2761] well content with weakness look at these words that keep popping up therefore I'm well content with weakness with insults with distresses with persecutions with difficulties for Christ's sake
[time=2774] for when I'm weak then I am strong because I'm revealing Christ's heart in me you know I
[time=2781] struggled immensely with these things my life has been a roller coaster of struggling with these
[time=2788] things but about 13 years ago I felt God was telling me to change the mission statement of
[time=2796] my business to serve God and serve others and I made sure my team knew it my employees knew it
[time=2803] but I didn't know if I really wanted to tell the customers that because I didn't want to turn off people far from God because as soon as they see something like that it tends to develop a connotation and and I wanted to develop authenticity and relationships and humility and wisdom but I felt God prompted me to do it so that's why I did it so I tucked away on every brochure we sent about three million brochures a year a hundred different unique brochures and I put
[time=2829] kind of under our logo near the postal and dasha that our mission was to serve God and serve others well I got this call one day from a guy from australia and I could tell that he was just kind of checking out whether or not it was trustworthy and as I got to talking with him I realized that
[time=2846] he had owned all the batmobiles from the most recent movies and he had licensed to to display
[time=2853] those and he had the boat and he had all kinds of stuff and he said as we got to talking more and more and more we're kind of hitting it off and he said you know I I just want you to know I saw
[time=2864] that line in your brochure and I said well what are you talking about I really didn't know I didn't know what he meant and he said well you know that line kind of by your logo I said oh and I
[time=2874] thought well what's he gonna say now which way is he gonna go with this and he said I just want you to know that I really think that anybody who's willing to stand up and be counted deserves a shot
[time=2888] and he was he was wondering whether or not he could trust somebody to send all this stuff across the earth and have that person have the stuff because there were war stories all over the place of people who would take a guy's collectible cars and then you know run off with him he says I think
[time=2904] anybody will stand up and be counted so we're taking a chance with and you know I don't think it's the line at all I don't think it's the mission statement words at all I think it's the heart I think it all comes back to a heart condition and I'm telling you when people in my company caught on that it wasn't about scoring with the people in front of you it was about serving their needs I'm telling you money took care of itself are you I want you to hear that today
[time=2929] whatever your career whatever it is you're doing with your life serve the needs of those around you this authority has been given to you by God this control
[time=2942] in order to serve others you cannot serve God and money serving two masters is serving one you can only serve God and have your desire satisfied and that happens when Christ is the
[time=2952] object of our desires. Proverbs 24 5, Proverbs 24 5 says a wise man has great power, a wise man
[time=2960] has great power, price measurement, money is price measurement of our giftedness, wisdom is
[time=2969] humility's measurement of our godliness. Number four write this in right this in there when
[time=2976] our security is found in Christ we've made our way all the way through the four desires lastly look at this with me would you when our security is found in Christ humility with humility we seek
[time=2988] God's kingdom first humility seeks God's kingdom first with money Matthew 6 25 to 33 let's go to
[time=2998] the text and I'm going to have you skip down to verse 31 can we do that? Verse 31 do not that was all all the verses preceding it's all about worry it's all about you and I wanting to be secure and find security in the stuff the clothes the place we live the needs that we have and he
[time=3015] says in 31 do not worry don't worry then saying what will we eat or what will we drink or what
[time=3021] will we wear for clothing for the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things you understand that statement
[time=3027] people people far from God people who don't have Christ centrally located they worry
[time=3035] about those things don't you worry no you be secure but seek first he knows that you need
[time=3044] all these things verse 33 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things
[time=3051] will be added to you with Christ my friends at the center of a fully surrendered heart
[time=3062] with a humble heart you and I will want first listen first and foremost to support
[time=3071] and give to what he is doing we'll want to give we will want to support we will want to invest
[time=3077] in his agenda his program and you know what his agenda and his program what he's doing the kingdom
[time=3084] of God my friends that is according to the New Testament the church the ministry of local
[time=3091] churches just like this one ministries that he has designed to reach in a powerful and relevant way
[time=3098] a lost and searching world and what our text teaches us and what we see today is that when you and I
[time=3105] in a fully surrendered relationship with him with Christ and humility centrally located will
[time=3113] want to will desire to will need to because of our commitment to him will make the offering
[time=3119] and it'll be first and foremost seeks God's kingdom first I'm reminded of Carl Pearson
[time=3128] sitting up here last week telling the story of his dad in the in the tenement building there in Chicago bringing the cash home from his work on the streetcar and the very first thing it's the
[time=3138] Proverbs three nine I think you can look it up or you can write that down Proverbs three nine it's the first fruits it's you and I bringing home whatever we bring home and that first check that first bit that we take out doesn't go to the mortgage it doesn't go to
[time=3154] the visa it doesn't go to the fund over here no it goes to God first and foremost that sacrificial
[time=3164] regular amount the heart that is secure in him gives first to the kingdom of God with Christ as
[time=3173] Lord and with a humble heart our worries about stuff begin to disappear and all of that stuff gets
[time=3181] met in the right time in the right place through the right means when our commitment to him is
[time=3187] secure would you look at Ecclesiastes I'm gonna ask Corbin if he'd come up at this time and would you look at Ecclesiastes 7 Mitch turned me on to this passage this week and I spent some time
[time=3198] looking through it and studying it and I couldn't wait to share this verse with you this morning Ecclesiastes 7 12 I want you to see as it relates to this issue of security especially for wisdom
[time=3210] verse 12 for wisdom is protection just as money is protection you could make a case that money
[time=3217] provides a sense of protection you can make a strong case that wisdom provides the same but look at this but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessor
[time=3232] do you see that you want to be you want to be secure you want to be protected you want to be
[time=3239] preserved you want to be held on to money's not going to provide that for you the only thing that
[time=3246] provides that is wisdom is the truth and the person of Christ a fully surrendered heart and
[time=3254] those four desires leads us my friends to a life a life that can be stewarded well
[time=3262] your time your talent your treasure I'm gonna ask you to do something I'm gonna ask Corbin if
[time=3271] you'd just play first here just for a moment it's gonna lead us in a song at the end but before he leads us in the song I just want to ask if you would just bow your heads and close your eyes for just a moment and if Corbin would just play we want to pray for you today and here's Mitch on I was just talking about it earlier and we thought maybe we'd give you an opportunity with your heads bowed and your eyes closed you know we've been working our way through this
[time=3295] passage and working our way through this concept of your life for the last several weeks and you
[time=3301] know what we we love you I hope you realize that we care deeply for you as part of this family
[time=3311] and we want to just pray for you this morning I know because I've talked with many of you Mitchell knows Steve knows because we've heard so much response but there are some in the room this morning and before God in all honesty you you would admit I'm sure that you need some help in being a good steward of your time in being a faithful and excellent steward with your talent
[time=3334] those unique opportunities that God has placed you in I know there are people in the room this
[time=3340] morning and as you've heard God's truth not our words but God's truth about treasure as you've
[time=3346] considered this battle between pride and humility I know there are some in the room and you could use some prayer and you could use some encouragement and you could use some support and some accountability maybe as it relates to you being a steward of the treasures that he has
[time=3363] entrusted to you however much that might be and so if in just the genuine honesty of your heart
[time=3370] if you would if you would like to be prayed for this morning with heads bowed and eyes closed we
[time=3378] just invite you to just slip up your hand if you just slip up your hand on any of those three fronts
[time=3386] your time your talent your treasure there you go just slip it up there in any of those arenas
[time=3396] if you're honest enough this morning to say before God God I need some help being more faithful and
[time=3402] God honoring and the way I give these things to you just hold them up for just one more moment
[time=3408] bless your hearts amen well Mitch why don't you pray for these hands that you see raised
[time=3416] just briefly and then we'll have Corbin closes God I just pray by the power of your Holy Spirit
[time=3422] that you would reveal yourself to each person who had his or her hand up and the God they would
[time=3430] realize that their desires are satisfied only in you only in Christ only you satisfy our desires
[time=3438] and God we need help we need help kind of like so what now what now God what do I do
[time=3444] how do I steward my time how do I steward my talent how do I steward my treasures God I pray that you will come alongside as the comforter and give wisdom to each person who held up his or her hand God help him to store up treasures in
[time=3462] heaven help him to be content enough to give God help him to serve to take the authority
[time=3469] that you've given them the control you've given them to serve and God help him to seek first
[time=3475] your kingdom and your righteousness the advancement of your divine rain rule and order on this earth
[time=3481] now God whether that be through it through tithing through offering or God just through
[time=3487] stewarding our resources so that we would be relational with people around us that would use our cars in our homes in our offices in our phones to reveal who you are and to advance your heart
[time=3500] God I'm just so reminded today that Jesus Christ is the humility of God that he said come to me
[time=3508] if you're weary and burdened I'll give you rest I'll restore your soul I'll satisfy your desires
[time=3515] because I'm gentle and I am humble in heart my desires are all directed toward the Father
[time=3522] you can trust me and so may it be so God and we pray these things in Jesus
[time=3552] [MUSIC]
[time=3582] you
