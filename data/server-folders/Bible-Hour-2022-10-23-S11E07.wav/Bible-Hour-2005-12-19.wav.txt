[time=214] "This one, this one will be our peace." And I hope this morning, I really do.
[time=225] My hope and my prayer for you is that you would today as you celebrate this season that is upon us as we consider the baby and his birth and all that that met.
[time=239] I hope this morning that there is in you a great sense of peace.
[time=243] That peace that surpasses all understanding.
[time=248] The peace that comes from knowing that a loving and gracious Heavenly Father because of his deep commitment to you sent his son, Emmanuel, who came near.
[time=260] And it is his coming, his birth, his life, his death, and his resurrection that allows you that great peace, that great comfort in knowing that you are his, absolutely and completely his.
[time=274] Why don't you bow your heads?
[time=276] I'll read that for you from Philippians 4.
[time=279] It says, "Be anxious for nothing.
[time=281] "But in everything, by prayer and supplication "with thanksgiving, let your request be made known "to God and the peace of God, "which surpasses all comprehension.
[time=292] "We'll guard your hearts and your minds in Christ, Jesus." [MUSIC - 201 seconds]
[time=514] (piano music) (audience applauds)
[time=524] - I'll tell you all this talk about the baby.
[time=530] Not Corbin's and Tanya's, but you know, the season that we celebrate.
[time=536] And I think what I just read to you there from Micah.
[time=538] And that last phrase there where it says he will be our peace.
[time=544] I just wanted to share this with you.
[time=546] Maybe a week ago, I held a baby, it had been a while.
[time=551] But, and I know there's a flip side to this description
[time=557] I'm about to give you.
[time=558] I've lived that flip side so you all know I realized that.
[time=562] But I held this baby who had just eaten and was hungry and was tired.
[time=567] And those of you who have been around babies or those of you who have had them or babysat them or just you know what that, there's that face that they make.
[time=580] There's that look about them.
[time=583] They're full, they're happy, they're asleep.
[time=587] And they're in someone's arms who loves them deeply.
[time=593] And there's just, I was just standing there looking at that face and the person asked me make you want to have another, I said no.
[time=604] (audience laughs) No, it doesn't mean you want to have another, it just reminds me and I hope you'll go with me here.
[time=610] That is, that's a baby, yeah, but that's you.
[time=615] That's me.
[time=619] And I know from infancy up to you know, now over some were talking 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years old, but I just, I hope and pray this morning that you could get your arms and your mind and your heart around that picture.
[time=633] 'Cause he loves you that much and he fills you like that.
[time=638] And he allows you and I to rest in his arms with that full, happy, sleepy face and just chill.
[time=646] And at a season where we tend to go so hard so fast, I hope you'll take some time to experience the peace
[time=656] of our God and the joy of being held and loved, not only the way he does.
[time=661] So anyway, what's the deal with the Magi?
[time=666] You know, I started thinking about that lately.
[time=671] This is a, this is this remarkable story, you know, that we've read and we've had read to us and I mean, you know, a Christmas season doesn't go by and we don't hear the songs about the three kings and the books get brought out and there we are at bedtime and there we are in the living room and we're telling the story of the three wise men.
[time=694] These Magi who came from the East, I can remember being a child and I can remember from my earliest days just kind of being fascinated by the story and the pictures that came with the story.
[time=706] And it seemed as if the pictures were all pretty much the same.
[time=710] We've got a few of them here I think for you this morning.
[time=714] I had them throw them up.
[time=715] We've got the caravan, you know, going across and there's the star and they're making their way.
[time=721] The next picture shows the manger scene and we know these wise men are making their way with their camels and their big golden boxes and then they get there and I think it's gonna come up here for you.
[time=736] And then they're there, they find the baby and they got their crowns and their robes and they give them their gifts and it's all a pretty amazing story.
[time=744] And you know, when you look into it, when you actually, as I've done in the last week or so, it is truly a fascinating story.
[time=755] And as I've looked into it and as I've studied and as I've thought about just spending some time together as a family this morning, trying to maybe learn a little bit more about this whole story of these men and their journey.
[time=769] I found some amazing stuff.
[time=772] And as I read, I just, I wrote some things down and I wanna share that with you this morning.
[time=776] Few biblical stories are as well known, yet so clouded by myth and tradition as that of the Magi mentioned in Matthew two.
[time=788] During the Middle Ages, for instance, there were countless and numerous legends and stories that were birthed about these guys and their journey.
[time=799] Some said that they were kings.
[time=801] The other legends and stories that were propagated said that they were three in number and that their names were Casper, Balthazar and Melchior because they were thought to represent the three sons of Noah.
[time=816] Some traditions have always kind of painted one of them to be Ethiopian in appearance, dark skinned in nature.
[time=824] A 12th century bishop of Cologne even claimed to have found in an archeological dig their three skulls all wrapped in gold inceptors.
[time=834] Fascinating stuff, fun to kind of speculate but none of that at least really biblical.
[time=841] And so it just kind of leads you and I to ask the question so, so who are these guys?
[time=849] Where did they come from?
[time=851] Well, what can we know about them?
[time=853] What can we learn, not just about them but what can we, if anything, what can we learn from them?
[time=859] What can we see in their journey to Bethlehem from the East?
[time=864] What can we take away from their response to the Christ once they finally found him?
[time=870] I would just invite you this morning to just kind of open your heart and mind and let's take a look at this truly remarkable story and see what we can learn from these magi in Matthew chapter two.
[time=882] If you got your Bibles, open up to Matthew two verses one through 12.
[time=888] Matthew chapter two verses one to 12 and why don't we read it together in honor of God's word?
[time=893] Would you stand with me this morning and allow me the privilege of reading this to you?
[time=899] It says in Matthew two verse one, now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea and the days of Herod the King, Magi from the East arrived in Jerusalem, in Jerusalem saying, where is he who has been born king of the Jews?
[time=916] Now I just want you to stop right there for a moment.
[time=918] Magi, we're gonna fill in the blanks as we go.
[time=924] Magi from the East, not from these parts.
[time=929] Magi who have traveled a great distance come and they say, the first thing that they say is where is this king who has been born?
[time=943] What does it say, king of the Jews?
[time=945] For we saw his star, how did they know?
[time=951] It was his star.
[time=954] For we saw his star in the East and have come to worship him.
[time=959] When Herod the king heard this he was troubled and all of Jerusalem with him, gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.
[time=972] Let me just say this at this point and then we'll move on.
[time=974] There was in this day, historically this is a recorded fact.
[time=978] There was in this day, in this season, there in Jerusalem and there in this region, there was great public and not just spiritual, there was great public and spiritual anticipation of the one who would come.
[time=992] This wasn't just for the God followers, you see, culture had gotten to a point, government had gotten to a point, Herod had gotten to a point where there was widespread talk of and great anticipation, it's written about, of the one who would come and redeem, the one who would come and save when they said to him verse five, where?
[time=1015] Where will he be born?
[time=1016] It says, in Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written by the prophet.
[time=1022] And here in verse six, he quotes from Micah and you Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you shall come forth a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.
[time=1036] Then Herod secretly called the Magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared.
[time=1044] He's working on something there and we'll come back to that.
[time=1047] And he sent them, he sent the Magi to Bethlehem and said, go, go and search carefully for the child.
[time=1053] And when you have found him, report to me so that I too may come and worship him.
[time=1059] After hearing the king, they went their way and the star, the star which they had seen in the east went on before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
[time=1070] When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
[time=1074] After coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother, and they fell to the ground and worshiped him.
[time=1081] Then opening their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
[time=1088] In verse 12, having been warned by God in a dream, not to return to Herod, the Magi left for their own country by another way.
[time=1098] Let's pray.
[time=1099] Father God, thank you so very much for the privilege
[time=1105] of being here in this room, together with these people on this morning.
[time=1111] And God, I know as I read this passage and as we begin
[time=1117] to consider this journey that these men made, I know that there are many in the room this morning who find themselves on quite a journey.
[time=1127] God, they have needs and they have questions.
[time=1134] They've got concerns, there is confusion.
[time=1137] And God, I pray that as you continue to draw them to yourself, those here in this room that don't know you yet, personally.
[time=1147] Oh, some may know about you.
[time=1149] And some in this room may be familiar with the Christmas story, but God, you know, and they know that they don't know you yet personally, intimately, as their Lord and their Savior.
[time=1161] And so God, do your miraculous work, like only you can do in the hearts of those that continue to search.
[time=1167] And for God, God, those in the room that know you.
[time=1171] For those in the room this morning who are Christ followers, who have given themselves completely to a relationship and a life with you, God, I pray that we would be so deeply profoundly grateful for this story as we watch it unfold.
[time=1186] God, may we identify with your saving work, the way you draw people to yourself, and may we today be so grateful that you did that very thing with us.
[time=1198] We love you, Father.
[time=1201] It is our desire to make much of you, to bring glory and honor to you, to your name, and to this story of salvation.
[time=1209] We pray, God, that you would allow us to do that.
[time=1213] In the name of your Son, we pray, amen.
[time=1216] You can be seated.
[time=1220] Well, the only legitimate, all right, the only legitimate facts that we know about these particular magi are the few given by Matthew in these first 12 verses of chapter two.
[time=1233] We are not, please note, we are not told their number.
[time=1238] There is no biblical mention of their names.
[time=1241] There is no mention of their means of transportation, and there is no talk or no reference made to the specific country or countries from which they came.
[time=1250] What we do know about them stems from some very interesting and insightful historical data.
[time=1257] There are some historical places of reference that you and I can go, and I went in these last couple of weeks, and I was amazed at what there was to see and what there was to glean.
[time=1268] What we do know about them stems from some interesting historical data, as well as some other biblical references, other than Matthew too, that kind of help us put a very interesting, very fascinating picture together.
[time=1281] Let's just do it this way.
[time=1283] Why don't we just ask some questions?
[time=1285] We'll ask some obvious and maybe even familiar questions and allow God's word and what we can learn from history to kind of steer us in a new direction.
[time=1295] Who were they?
[time=1296] Number one, write this down.
[time=1298] Who were they?
[time=1299] Who were these magi and where did they come from?
[time=1307] The phrase or the concept of magi, and I want to explain this to you, the first time we see magi appearing in history is in the seventh century BC, seventh century BC, hundreds, hundreds of years before Christ.
[time=1325] They come on the historical scene as a tribe within the median nation in Eastern Mesopotamia.
[time=1332] Many historians consider them to have been semites, which if so, made them descendants of Noah's son, Shem.
[time=1340] The magi, as they progressed, they became skilled in astronomy and astrology, which in that day were closely associated, and they were involved in various occult practices, including sorcery and magic, and they were especially noted.
[time=1359] This is where it starts to get interesting.
[time=1362] Right out of the gate, I hope you got your antenna up.
[time=1365] These magi were especially noted for their ability to interpret dreams.
[time=1372] This was what they had become known for.
[time=1376] This was their strength.
[time=1378] This was their gift.
[time=1379] The magi were monotheistic.
[time=1383] Monotheistic, big word, real simple meaning.
[time=1386] Mono, meaning one, theistic God.
[time=1389] They believed in the existence of only one God.
[time=1392] Because of their monotheism, it was easy for the magi to adapt to the teaching of the sixth century Persian religious leader named Zoroster, who believed in a single God and a cosmic struggle between good and evil.
[time=1406] Darius the Great, the leader of the Persian nation at that time, he established Zoroastianism as the state religion of Persia in that day.
[time=1416] Now, because of the magi's combined knowledge, and this group, this sect, they became extremely bright.
[time=1425] I mean, they had given themselves to a number of studies and because of their combined knowledge of science, agriculture, mathematics, history, and the occult, their religious and political influence continued to grow until they became the most prominent and powerful group of advisors in the Medo-Persian and subsequently the Babylonian Empire.
[time=1451] The Babylonian Empire to the east.
[time=1455] It's not strange, therefore, that they often were referred to as wise men.
[time=1463] It may even be that the law of the Medes and Persians, as referenced in Daniel 6, was founded on the teachings of these magi.
[time=1472] Now, check this out.
[time=1474] History books will tell you, and from some of the reading that I did this last week, history will tell you that no Persian, no Persian was ever able to become king.
[time=1487] No Persian could ever be crowned king without the mastering of scientific and religious disciplines presented forth by the Magi, and no king was ever approved, and no king was ever crowned without the Magi being present.
[time=1508] They were king makers.
[time=1510] They were king declarerers.
[time=1514] That was what they did.
[time=1516] Now, we learn from the book of, now it gets really interesting, least in my opinion.
[time=1523] I hope you're with me.
[time=1525] I hope you're moving along this road with me.
[time=1527] We learn from the book of Daniel.
[time=1529] Now Daniel, stop there.
[time=1530] Daniel, Daniel, young, Daniel, young Jewish boy, probably 13, 14, 15 years of age.
[time=1538] Remember Daniel, taken captive in the exile.
[time=1541] He gets moved from Jerusalem.
[time=1543] He's captured by this crazed king named Nebuchadnezzar, and he's deported to this place called what?
[time=1550] Babylon, where Nebuchadnezzar rules.
[time=1554] And now when you go to the biblical record and you go back to Daniel, you learn from Daniel that the Magi were among the highest ranking officials in Babylon.
[time=1563] Because the Lord, remember the story?
[time=1566] Because the Lord gave Daniel the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, which none of the other wise men were able to do.
[time=1575] Daniel was appointed as ruler over, look at Daniel, 248.
[time=1580] Or you can write that down.
[time=1581] It'll probably be on the screen for you.
[time=1583] Because Nebuchadnezzar has the dream.
[time=1585] He wants it interpreted.
[time=1587] He goes to the men who were supposed to be able to interpret it.
[time=1591] The Magi, the Magi can't interpret it.
[time=1594] Daniel comes onto the scene, Daniel interprets it.
[time=1597] And it says because he was able to, Daniel was appointed as ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the, what?
[time=1609] Wise men of Babylon.
[time=1613] Daniel, Daniel, who understood.
[time=1618] Daniel, who knew the story.
[time=1620] Daniel, who had a clear understanding of what would transpire, put in charge of ruler of, over, responsible for the Magi, the wise men.
[time=1631] Because of his great wisdom and because he had successfully pleated for the lives of the wise men who had failed to interpret the king's dream, you see that in Daniel 2.24.
[time=1643] You can write that down.
[time=1645] Daniel 2.24, see Daniel felt for these guys.
[time=1648] These guys, their heads were literally on the line.
[time=1651] It says in Daniel 2.24, therefore Daniel went into area whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon.
[time=1660] The Magi were gonna get wiped out.
[time=1662] Daniel goes and spoke to him as follows.
[time=1665] It says there at the end of 24, do not destroy the wise men, the Magi of Babylon.
[time=1672] Take me into the king's presence and I will declare the interpretation to the king.
[time=1680] Now, for me, just as I've thought this through, as I've had the chance to study and read, this, my friends, is where it gets really, really cool.
[time=1692] For me, as I think about this story, this, this is where it starts to really, really take shape.
[time=1699] And here's what I mean by cool.
[time=1701] Here's what I mean by exciting.
[time=1703] My friends, I've been, I've been reading this and I have been trying my best to study it and I've been doing my best with his help to communicate it.
[time=1714] I have been giving myself to this great truth in this amazing book here for about 20, 22 years.
[time=1721] And I have a lot to learn.
[time=1724] There's a lot that I haven't seen yet, I'm sure.
[time=1728] There are many truths I've yet to discover, but I'll tell you what, if you made me, if somebody forced me after 20-some years of reading and studying, if you said, "Hey, we need you to whittle all this down to one concept." Could you take all of the scriptures and everything that you've read and all that we see here and is there, as you've read it and experienced it, a common thread or theme that runs throughout, I would say to you, yes, I would say that in all my years, I have been amazed again and again and again at how God, the God of the Bible, from beginning to end in so many different and unique situations, what he seems to do repeatedly is that he points people toward, he prepares people for, he is leading and he is guiding and he is pointing back here at the beginning and even back here towards the end, it always seems to be God pointing people to who?
[time=1790] Jesus.
[time=1792] Christ.
[time=1796] And it's just, it's spectacular the way he does it.
[time=1799] I think about, I think about all the law and the prophets.
[time=1803] I think about the Old Testament and the nation of Israel and how all of the law pointed toward Christ and the fulfillment that he brought.
[time=1812] I read story after story, you read account after account and he is always again and again pointing people toward, steering people toward Jesus toward faith.
[time=1826] And as I read this story and as I've studied and thought through this fascinating scene with these magi and who they were and where they came from, it just hit me like a truck this week and I was amazed all over again.
[time=1844] Watch this, because of Daniel, because of Daniel's high position and great respect that he now had from the magi.
[time=1855] And again, all of that was God ordained, all of that was the providence and sovereignty of God, working in that situation to put Daniel now over the magi and now he has this great position of respect and admiration and it seems for certain that the magi would have learned much from Daniel about the one true God, the God of Israel, about his will and that God of Israel's plan to one day bring a king.
[time=1884] And as they would have known Daniel and as they would have listened to Daniel, as they would have become familiar with the prophecies of Daniel, those men living now up close with Daniel would have, I'm sure, come to understand certain things that were to transpire in the days to come.
[time=1904] Now Daniel aside, I learned something this week that was really interesting, many of the Jews in that setting when the exile was over, when they were allowed to go back to Jerusalem, when the Babylonian captivity came to an end, yes, many of them went home, but guess what?
[time=1920] Not all of them.
[time=1922] History will tell you that many of the Jews in that culture stayed and they intermarried with those from the Babylonian far Eastern community and their presence with what they believed and with what they knew was coming, stayed right there.
[time=1942] It didn't go back to Jerusalem, it stayed right there in Babylon in that Medo-Persian empire, hundreds and hundreds of years before it was to be Christ's coming, even in Babylon, think about it,
[time=1962] would have been anticipated, hundreds of years before.
[time=1966] I believe these magi, it's my conviction and I thought about it this week, I think hands down, these magi in Matthew two, I believe they were surely influenced by Judaism and by the prophetic writing and the prophetic teaching and the prophetic living of a prophet named Daniel.
[time=1986] And so having seen, so having seen the star,
[time=1992] a historical event, my friends, we can dig right back into the history books and we can read about this star, this amazing phenomenon that happened in the sky at this time and you know what?
[time=2007] They would have even known about that through the influence, the Judeo influence, go back to numbers, write this down, numbers, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus numbers, go to numbers 24-7, numbers 24-7, they would have even known about this, it says I see him, I see him, but not now, I behold him, but not near, a star shall come forth from Jacob, a scepter shall rise from Israel and shall crush through the forehead of Moab and tear down all the sons of Sheth, this star was something the Old Testament had prophesied regarding, they were aware of this and so having seen the star, these magi, my friends, they begin their journey.
[time=2055] And I say, I say, thanks, thanks to God.
[time=2061] Thanks to God, the divine seed planter who had hundreds of years earlier planted seeds of faith and anticipation in the hearts and minds of those far from him in a land very far away in the midst of a drastically different culture.
[time=2079] God had prepared hearts for the birth of his son.
[time=2082] He planted seeds that in time would prepare people and lead people on a journey to the Savior.
[time=2089] People like the magi, and you know what?
[time=2094] People like you, people just like you.
[time=2099] Many of you here today, and I was thinking about this first hour, a little bit different, second hour 'cause there's a few more of you.
[time=2112] But it's just so nice for me because of how I view you and because of the relationship that we have.
[time=2122] I was just about to say, many of you here today find yourselves on that spiritual journey.
[time=2127] Well, you know what, the fact of the matter is I know that that's true because I have the privilege of knowing so many of you.
[time=2135] You have graciously and so many of you have willingly
[time=2141] opened your life and your journey to us.
[time=2145] And I see your faces and I know that you're here and I know that there are many in the room this morning and you have not come.
[time=2151] You have not come to that place of full surrender.
[time=2154] You have not come to that point yet where you have in your heart before God been willing to submit and subject all of you to him.
[time=2162] You know about him but you don't know him yet.
[time=2166] But as I think about you, those of you on that spiritual journey and as I think about this story of the Magi and as I think about the seeds that God planted hundreds of years before, it just amazes me as I watch him do what he does.
[time=2184] As I watch him do what he did here and as I watch him do what he did with you, I wrote a few things down.
[time=2190] Some of you are here today on a spiritual journey and God planted spiritual seed in your heart through a faithful friend or spouse.
[time=2199] I know that's the truth.
[time=2202] I know there are some in this room this morning where you're watching on the broadcast or you're listening on the internet or somebody's giving you a CD and you're listening and you're engaged in this discussion and you are on a spiritual journey and it was a faithful friend or maybe a spouse who not only loved you enough to talk to you about the truth but they've loved you enough to model it genuinely in their life.
[time=2227] And that seed may have been planted three months ago or three years ago but I am so thankful and we are so grateful that you continue on this journey.
[time=2237] A journey began when God planted a seed in your heart through a faithful friend or spouse.
[time=2243] Some of you listening today, some of you here in this room, you're on this spiritual journey and he planted this spiritual seed one Sunday morning three, four months ago.
[time=2254] Two years ago, as I talked with a lady following first hour,
[time=2261] she came right up to me afterwards and she just wanted me to know, probably late 50s, early 60s, a couple of grandkids here on her side.
[time=2269] She's coming on her own and it was about two years ago she said that she was flipping through the channels early one Sunday morning, came to channel 21, 7 a.m.
[time=2278] and before she knew it, she was watching church.
[time=2281] And she was real gracious and kind how she said this.
[time=2286] It wasn't so much the speaker, it was the message which I can identify with.
[time=2292] And maybe you're here this morning and you can identify with that.
[time=2297] Maybe that broadcast, something about not the speaker but the message.
[time=2302] It connected with your seeking, searching heart and God planted a seed in you right there, a seed of faith and anticipation and you've been walking that journey since.
[time=2312] You know what, maybe he planted this seed in you years ago through a faithful grandmother or grandfather or mom or dad or uncle.
[time=2320] Maybe somebody years ago used to sit with you and tell you the stories of those Bible heroes from a time long ago and as you heard those stories and as she or he implanted that truth and you maybe now years later, some of it is beginning to make sense.
[time=2339] Maybe now years later you're continuing to move down this road toward faith.
[time=2343] Maybe you know what, maybe the seed that God planted in you came through an employer.
[time=2348] Maybe it was a neighbor.
[time=2352] Possibly it was a classmate who first invited you or befriended you.
[time=2358] Maybe it was at Christmas, maybe it was at Easter.
[time=2361] You know what, possibly it was at a time of personal conflict or crisis.
[time=2365] Maybe at a time of great confusion for you but here's my point, my friends, you know what, he does it in a thousand different ways.
[time=2372] The seed, it gets planted, the seed, it gets thrown and he does it in a thousand different ways in a thousand different settings in a thousand different scenarios.
[time=2385] But here's the point, it always leads to the same place.
[time=2390] It always leads to Jesus.
[time=2394] It always leads to the manger.
[time=2398] Amen, that's the way he does it.
[time=2401] It always leads Matthew 121.
[time=2405] Write that down or just look across your page.
[time=2408] It always leads to what?
[time=2410] She will bear a son, Matthew 121.
[time=2413] She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus for he will what, say it, for he will save his people from their sins. It always leads to salvation.
[time=2425] And again, I know some of you.
[time=2430] And I get really, I get really excited and I get really hopeful on mornings like this because I know many of you and I know, I know a few of you are really, really close.
[time=2443] I know that he has been at work.
[time=2446] I know that you have been greatly encouraged.
[time=2448] I know that you've learned a great deal on this journey and I know many of you in the room this morning are really close to drawing that line in the sand and putting that stake in the ground and saying that's it.
[time=2461] I believe and I fully surrender my heart and life
[time=2467] to the Lord Jesus Christ and I hope and I mean that.
[time=2469] I hope and we have prayed.
[time=2471] But today and in this season that you would identify and realize what a journey he has brought you on just like these guys.
[time=2479] He planted seed and he has led you to the manger.
[time=2482] And now my question for you today is how will you respond?
[time=2486] What are you gonna do?
[time=2490] He's an amazing God.
[time=2491] Remember, he gives you choice.
[time=2494] He could have done this thing completely differently.
[time=2496] He could have been a God with strings and puppets and he could have made you and I do or believe or say, but he didn't.
[time=2502] He gave you and I choice.
[time=2504] And he said, here's my story and here's what I've done and here's what I'm offering and you and I have the chance to respond.
[time=2512] And before I show you, it's gonna be really, I'm looking forward to it.
[time=2516] I wanna show you the response that the magi had.
[time=2520] Before we do that, let me just, if I can, maybe clear up one more popular misconception.
[time=2527] You can write this question down.
[time=2529] When did they actually see the magi as they make this journey and now they come to where he is?
[time=2537] When did they actually see baby Jesus?
[time=2540] Look at the text.
[time=2541] Would you go to back to chapter two, verse 11?
[time=2543] It says in Matthew two, 11.
[time=2546] It says, after coming into the, what did it say, house.
[time=2551] Matthew two, 11.
[time=2553] After coming into the house, they saw the child.
[time=2557] Now, Luke, Luke, if you go over to Luke and if you read the Luke narrative, if you go through the story that's given there and Luke, you realize, and then we believe it's true, that at the time of birth, there was no room for them and the what?
[time=2570] There was no room for them in the end and biblical record and we believe historical record would indicate that the baby Jesus was born in the stall, that the baby Jesus was born in the mangers where he was laid.
[time=2583] It was a lean to, there were some animals, the straw, the mud, the whole thing.
[time=2587] We believe that's exactly how that happened.
[time=2591] What we see now in Matthew two is that some time has passed.
[time=2594] They are now no longer taking up residence in a barn, they have now made their way to a house.
[time=2600] How they got it, who's it was, we don't know, but some time has transpired.
[time=2604] Interesting, just a few thoughts on that for you.
[time=2607] Luke also tells you that at eight days he was circumcised.
[time=2610] Luke also goes on to tell you that he was at 40 days, he was presented or dedicated to God in the temple.
[time=2618] And so for whatever it's worth, and I say that kind of tongue in cheek because there are some who want to make a really big deal about how old Jesus was when these guys came.
[time=2628] Personally, I don't see it.
[time=2630] I don't think it's as significant as what we're about to get to here.
[time=2635] But I will tell you somewhere between 40 days and two years of age.
[time=2639] The little infant picture in the straw with the gifts and the camels, probably not the most accurate.
[time=2648] Probably 40 days to two years somewhere in there.
[time=2652] Not incredibly significant though, but this is.
[time=2657] What we want to see next, I think,
[time=2663] is the most significant thing in this entire story.
[time=2668] And the thing I want every single one of you in this room this morning to see and to catch and to take in. Last question.
[time=2678] When the journey led them to Jesus, write this down and give this some thought.
[time=2684] When the journey led them to Jesus, what was their response?
[time=2689] These magicians, these sorcerers, these noble, smart guys from over in Godless Babylon,
[time=2702] when they finally found him, when they finally see him, when they finally come into his presence, what is their response?
[time=2710] Come with me back to the text.
[time=2711] Would you, Matthew, chapter two, verses nine to 11.
[time=2716] After hearing the king, Herod.
[time=2719] And again, Herod was saying, come back to me and tell me where he is.
[time=2724] After hearing the king, the Magi, they went on their way.
[time=2727] And the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood over, or literally in the Greek there, came almost to rest upon, what does it say there?
[time=2742] The place where the child was.
[time=2744] Now, there's some debate about that.
[time=2746] There would be some who would say that, and it's kind of funny to me.
[time=2750] It's humorous that they would say this because this is a discussion about God.
[time=2754] But there are some who would say that that was physically or scientifically like impossible.
[time=2759] There is no way that a star, that star, that historical star, they say no way that star could physically, in the laws of nature, come and reside on top of a house.
[time=2772] Some would speculate that what they now saw as they leave Herod and make their way to the house would be the Shekinah glory.
[time=2782] Often referred to in the Old Testament there, the literal, the Shekinah glory, the light, the glow that represented or manifested the presence of God, the place of God, I don't know.
[time=2794] If you're telling me it's physically impossible for a star to rest on a house, well, yeah, there's a lot of things physically impossible that God did, amen?
[time=2805] So it could have been, it might have been the glow, it could have been the Shekinah, either way, here's the point, God leads these men to the place.
[time=2814] Because it always, my friends, he does it a thousand different ways, but it always ends up at the same place at Jesus, at the manger in this place, in the house.
[time=2827] It says in verse nine, the place where the child was, now watch this, this is great, this is where I start to get even more excited.
[time=2834] When verse 10, when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
[time=2842] And I looked at that sentence, I thought, wow, that's a little repetitive.
[time=2846] And then I looked at the Greek and then if you translate it from the Greek to the English, just word for word, here's how they, this is what it's saying about the beginnings of their response.
[time=2857] They were joyful beyond joyfulness with great and increasing joy.
[time=2862] These guys were a little fired up.
[time=2866] These guys, they realized, they were now beginning to sense
[time=2872] where this journey had led them.
[time=2876] And they were joyful beyond joyfulness, these magicians, these sorcerers, these wise guys from a godless place,
[time=2887] a long way away, drawn by God, and they are joyful beyond joyfulness with great and increasing joy.
[time=2896] They had traveled so far, they had experienced so much, and now God leads them to this house in Bethlehem.
[time=2903] Listen, it was there that the magi found the one for whom they had so diligently searched.
[time=2909] And at last, they fell down.
[time=2913] They fell down.
[time=2918] And what, say it, worshiped Him, these magicians,
[time=2924] these sorcerers, these guys from a land far away.
[time=2932] Now, interesting, in the Greek there, there is a phrase that He could have used, and it would have been extremely appropriate.
[time=2944] There's a phrase that the writer there inspired by the spirit of God could have used that would have allowed Him in that passage right there to communicate what would have been inappropriate.
[time=2956] They could have easily said that He knelt, that they knelt.
[time=2962] There's a fell down phrase in the Greek that would have communicated this, because they were in the presence of one who deserved their respect.
[time=2973] But my friends, that is not the phrase that the spirit of God prompts the writer here to use in describing these men's response.
[time=2988] Now remember this, whether He was 40 days or two years, what we know is this, there was no message given.
[time=2997] There was no fanfare, there were no lights.
[time=3002] Well, there was a big one on the roof, maybe, but there weren't any lights inside.
[time=3006] You with me?
[time=3007] They were just in His, what, presence.
[time=3012] And the Greek word here and the phrase that's used is not kneeled down, no, it's fall down.
[time=3019] And it represents, it just represents a face in the ground with arms spread in absolute and utter humiliation,
[time=3030] appropriate humiliation.
[time=3034] It is just a face in the ground.
[time=3036] I cannot look at you.
[time=3038] I dare not stand in your presence.
[time=3042] There is no way that I can be here in my unworthiness and be even seen by you.
[time=3049] And so I will lay here with my face on the ground and I will adore you, I will worship you.
[time=3054] These magicians, these sorcerers,
[time=3062] these guys who had been on quite a journey, who had been through so much and they come into the presence of the King.
[time=3073] It's King they had heard about and learned about for years and years and years.
[time=3079] And I think about 1 Corinthians 14.
[time=3083] We've looked at that passage before.
[time=3085] 1 Corinthians 14, Paul talks about the ungifted or unsaved man who comes into your assembly and he hears or he sees you prophesying, proclaiming what is true, he walks in, this ungifted, unsaved, unbelieving man.
[time=3100] He walks into the assembly and when he experiences the assembly in worship, he falls down, puts his face on the ground and says, surely God must be among you.
[time=3112] The blind man and the gospels falls on his face, read the book of Revelation, everywhere you look in the book of Revelation, as far as the physical posture.
[time=3123] And see, we get so hung up on this thing.
[time=3129] We get so nervous, some of you get nervous with me laying there on the carpet.
[time=3135] We get so hung up on these genuine acts
[time=3142] of these biblically portrayed, genuine acts of reverence.
[time=3147] And yet again and again and again, we see people physically responding to the presence of God with a heart and a mind that says, I have got to lower myself here, I have got to humble myself.
[time=3163] And this is their response, absolute, unadulterated face-down worship.
[time=3172] And yet if a dear soul sitting next to you were to get up and kneel down during a worship time, if someone nearby was to, without drawing great attention to themselves, just simply and humbly lay face-down in a posture of respect and adoration, there are many who would struggle.
[time=3199] And yet the Psalms proclaim it and the gospels proclaim it in Revelation proclaims it and that was their response.
[time=3212] Charles Wesley captured the experience in his beautiful Christmas hymn, Hark the Herald Angels sing, veiled in flesh the Godhead sea, hail the incarnate deity, pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus our Emmanuel.
[time=3234] In his wonderful grace God had led them to his son and he allowed them to see him face to face.
[time=3243] Now I want you to note something here.
[time=3245] Matthew was careful, I believe, in the way he communicates this, to indicate that they worshiped him, that is the child.
[time=3254] They didn't worship the mother.
[time=3259] Cornelius, I believe it was Cornelius and Acts,
[time=3266] got a little confused and tried to worship.
[time=3268] Peter, it was the group of folks in Listra in their excitement tried to worship Paul and Barnabas and at every turn, that's not how that goes.
[time=3279] Our Lord, our Savior, our King is the one
[time=3285] and the only one who is worthy of our praise and our face down humble-hearted worship.
[time=3293] What's your response?
[time=3300] You know what I ask that to everybody in this room?
[time=3303] Those of you on the journey, what's your response?
[time=3307] He has brought you to the manger.
[time=3309] He has allowed you to see face to face, this King who came to give you life.
[time=3313] What are you gonna do?
[time=3314] Are you gonna do it your way?
[time=3315] Are you gonna continue to live independently from him?
[time=3318] And you know what?
[time=3318] Those of you in the room who are believers, those of you who are Christ followers, it's okay to ask you again, what's your response?
[time=3327] This season, in this time, as we give ourselves to this celebration, are you going to allow yourself to respond in a way that deeply and genuinely expresses your gratitude and your thanks?
[time=3342] One last thing I wanna show you and I wanna take you back to the passage.
[time=3348] One last thing, look at verse 12, and having been warned by God in a dream could have been Gabriel again.
[time=3355] As we've noted recently, Gabriel got pretty busy all of a sudden.
[time=3359] He made a few visits, and here we see another visit, having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way, and a dream God had warned them not to return to Herod.
[time=3373] Now listen, what we know about Herod, amazing, amazing story here.
[time=3377] What we know about Herod is this, is that he was absolutely and utterly ruthless.
[time=3384] He was insanely jealous.
[time=3387] He was insanely and deeply wicked and full of evil to his core.
[time=3392] He had killed just in recent days, historically, as you piece all this together, they'll tell you that within days of all of this transpiring, in his rage and nervousness, and in saying jealousy, he had killed his own wife and murdered his own three kids.
[time=3409] And in a last ditch effort to kill the baby Jesus as you go on in Matthew, you see that he orders the murder of all two-year-old and younger male babies in an attempt to somehow, in an attempt to somehow physically stop the spread
[time=3427] of hope and peace and the gospel, in an effort to somehow squelch the king, in an effort to somehow cut him off and remove this one who God said would come.
[time=3443] I want to remind you today, it didn't work.
[time=3445] God comes to Joseph, another appearing and another warning, and he sends Joseph and Mary off to Egypt and they escape the sword of Herod.
[time=3455] And God protects the Magi.
[time=3458] Don't think for a moment, you know, that Herod had some soft place in his heart for them.
[time=3463] Can you imagine what he would have done to them, knowing they had given him gifts?
[time=3471] I want you to think about this as you go today.
[time=3473] He protected the Savior, he protected the Magi, he protected Mary and Joseph.
[time=3478] And you know what, you can look back like I can.
[time=3481] I can tell you the night, I can tell you the night and the day in September of 1983, in the back row of a church on the right side on a Sunday night in the middle of Romans 7, when I fully surrendered my heart and life to Jesus Christ.
[time=3497] And I will tell you that at that moment, it became incredibly clear to me what he had protected me from.
[time=3504] And I just want you to realize, especially those of you that are so close today, he has protected you, he has guarded you, he has guided you, he has put a, he has put a hedge around you and he has brought you to this point and given you the opportunity to end this season, open your heart to a king who came to give life.
[time=3527] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3558] (upbeat music)
