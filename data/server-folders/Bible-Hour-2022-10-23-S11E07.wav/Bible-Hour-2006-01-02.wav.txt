[time=30] Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and
[time=48] on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=62] of the Son and the Holy Spirit."
[time=70] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=76] the end of the age, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=88] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and it is great to
[time=98] be with you again.
[time=100] What you are going to see today on the broadcast, I just want you to know, is probably from what I've seen and from what I've heard from many others, probably the most powerful, most compelling message you've ever heard from our own Dr. Mitchell Crews.
[time=115] I am so grateful, as I know many of you are, for Mitchell, so thankful for his heart and his love for the Word of God and his love for what God has allowed us to be a part of here in the church today.
[time=126] And what you're going to hear, I promise you, will challenge you and encourage you.
[time=130] So get ready, open your heart and be prepared for God to really, I think, work in your heart
[time=137] and in your spirit today.
[time=138] Hey, I also want to take some time to introduce to you a friend of mine.
[time=143] This is my good friend and partner, partner in life and ministry, and his name is Marshall
[time=150] White, and Marshall and I have been friends for a couple, two, three years now.
[time=155] And I am so grateful for Marshall, so thankful for the things that I have learned from him, and I am not only thankful for his friendship, I am incredibly grateful for what he does with his life.
[time=166] Marshall is the president and CEO of an organization entitled UPAF, Unity Performing Arts Foundation.
[time=174] And UPAF is this incredible organization that has this deep drive and passion to work with
[time=180] young people as it relates to the arts.
[time=183] And I'm going to have him tell you a little bit more about that in just a minute or so, but I want you to know this, tonight, January 8th, as you're viewing this, it will be coming
[time=192] up tonight at 5 p.m., Marshall and Unity Performing Arts Foundation family and all these kids that
[time=199] are a part of this choir, underneath the UPAF umbrella, one of the things they do is a youth
[time=205] choral program.
[time=206] It is an amazing youth choir, 70 to 80 or so young people will be here along with a band
[time=214] and orchestra, and it's going to be an incredible night, a five-year reunion for this winter
[time=220] soulful celebration that they do each year.
[time=223] And I can't wait for you to see this amazing group of kids and folks that Marshall gets to work with.
[time=230] We want you to come tonight and be a part of it.
[time=232] Marshall, tell the folks just briefly about the organization, tell them how you got started, what you're about, and then tell them what they're going to experience tonight if they'll come and be with us.
[time=241] What I'm excited about is how much you know about it already.
[time=245] It's like, wow, I mean, it's incredible, I'm telling you, Unity Performing Arts Foundation,
[time=251] an organization that we started five years ago, and we're on the campus of Indiana Purdue University, and it's basically an organization we started to allow young people to experience
[time=264] the arts from mainstream perspective.
[time=268] We know that mainstream music today is basically drawing our kids' attention.
[time=273] So we thought, why not take an educational environment and place it in a community organization
[time=281] and start a program that, or an organization, that would actually study and train kids in
[time=287] mainstream music, and so that's what we've done.
[time=290] And so we have six artistic modules, dance, creative writing, oratory, instrumental and
[time=297] drama, and then choral.
[time=299] And so the Voices of Unity Youth Choir is the youth choral program of UPAF.
[time=304] And we are so excited the kids are from the ages of eight to 20, and we got about 83 kids
[time=310] in this program now, and it is booming, and these young people are phenomenal.
[time=314] Awesome.
[time=315] And you know that.
[time=316] You've heard of them.
[time=317] I've seen them.
[time=318] And when we say soulful, when Marshall says a soulful celebration, I know I may not be
[time=325] the person you would think knows a lot about soul, but I know a little bit about soul.
[time=331] And this is more soulful, I promise you, than anyone's ever seen.
[time=335] And so we want to make sure that you come and join us tonight.
[time=338] And can I add this point, that tonight what they're going to experience is music, sacred
[time=345] music, praise and worship, gospel, spirituals, all types of Christian music tonight.
[time=349] And so they're going to have an exciting time.
[time=352] And we're looking forward to them being with us here in this room, and we can't wait for you to come tonight and join us.
[time=359] Please give it some thought.
[time=360] 5 p.m.
[time=361] It'll go until about 7 p.m. and we cannot wait to see how God uses these young voices,
[time=367] and I promise you, you will be not only encouraged, but inspired by their love for music and
[time=374] the gifting that God has placed on them.
[time=376] It's truly amazing.
[time=377] Come and be with us tonight, 5 p.m. right here at Black Hawk.
[time=380] We'll look forward to seeing you then.
[time=382] God bless you.
[time=383] So how's everybody doing?
[time=388] Well, I want to start off 2006, the new year, by confessing a sin in front of all of you.
[time=398] And picture's going to come to the screen.
[time=401] Oh, I love you guys.
[time=406] But 2006, Mercedes, SLR McLaren, built to be, how many people saw the article?
[time=414] Yeah, built to be the fastest car on the planet, V8 supercharged, 0 to 60 in 3.8 seconds.
[time=423] In fact, it doesn't do anything below 60, so I don't even know why they do that.
[time=427] Oh my goodness, and the price is not for the faint heart, $455,000.
[time=436] 2006, Mercedes McLaren, supercharged V8 SLR, 617 horsepower, $455,000, gold-winged doors,
[time=446] less than one per dealer.
[time=448] And all the men said, amen, that's right, oh, that's right.
[time=456] Well, several weeks ago, a friend of mine who I sold lots of cars to and lots of cars
[time=465] for, who has one of the most significant car collections in the world, said, hey Mitch,
[time=473] I have tickets, as you know, at the Cincinnati Bengals game, just wondered if you'd want to come to the Bengals game, you have my seats, they're playing the Colts, and you can come look at the cars and you can drive my new 2006 Mercedes SLR, to which I replied, yes.
[time=494] So we go down and they let me drive the Ferrari F-41st, which was built to be the fastest car
[time=501] on the streets, it's not even street legal in some places, and after that little slice of heaven on earth, he said, well, do you want to try it?
[time=509] And I said, well, you go first, and I'm not kidding you, what I experienced was unbelievable.
[time=519] My heart started beating fast, I was breathing hard, this car is incredible.
[time=525] When he stood on it to get out of his parking lot, the back end starts coming around one way, then it starts coming around the other way, and I said, are you doing that?
[time=532] He says, no man, it's the car, to which I said, yes.
[time=540] So he takes him around all these side roads, going really fast, and then he pulls into parking lot and says, do you want to try it, to which I replied, yes.
[time=551] So I said, well, I'm not sure that I want to accelerate quite the way that you did because with that back end comes around, you know, I don't want to put us in a spin and hurt your car or anything.
[time=559] And he said, no problem, it's all electronically programmed that it won't come around, it stops
[time=565] itself.
[time=566] I'm not kidding you, this thing was like a Learjet when you take off like you're on a millennium at Cedar Point, it pushes your skin back, I've been in a lot of fast cars.
[time=576] Never, ever have I felt the life that I felt when I was in this car and the acceleration, the speed was unbelievable, did I say 617 horsepower?
[time=587] So I'm driving on these little side roads, kind of in town, and Harry goes, wait a minute,
[time=595] get on the interstate, I said, okay, actually I said, yes.
[time=599] And he goes, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, let that car get out in front of you.
[time=603] I said, okay.
[time=606] And Harry then said to me, probably the three most meaningful words one man can say
[time=614] to another man, stand on it.
[time=620] To which I replied, yes, I'm not kidding you, 3.8 seconds, I don't think so.
[time=628] I'm just like that, I'm on that car that I let get on the highway in front of me, I'm on it so fast I got to go down in that place where two lanes, you're not supposed to be where they come together and get over there and I'm in the middle lane and I'm telling you this thing is just like a jet, it's unbelievable, it makes me excited just thinking, I see
[time=645] the picture, it's driving me crazy.
[time=647] So anyway, I'm just on the tail of this car and I see out of the corner of my eye 55 miles
[time=654] per hour, I said, Harry 55 miles per hour, I didn't think they'd do that anymore.
[time=659] Harry, I'm going blank, the speed limit, a multiple of the speed limit.
[time=666] And I saw it, a wide open left lane, nobody there.
[time=678] And Harry said, stand on it.
[time=681] And I said, yes, and I'm telling you that car just practically leaped off the highway.
[time=690] The next thing I feel is Harry's hand hitting my chest and he said, there's a cop and I
[time=696] said, I thought you'd be more gracious than he said and I said, yeah, right.
[time=703] And I responded to what's that guy doing standing there on the left side of the berm
[time=709] by his car and then I realized who it was because this is what I saw.
[time=727] And so it was a cop and I pulled over on the left side of the highway with my head in my
[time=734] hands and I said, hey, Harry, you're the devil.
[time=743] I didn't.
[time=744] Have I mentioned that Harry's Baptist, by the way.
[time=748] And I said, what are we going to do now?
[time=751] He goes, you are going to get your ticket.
[time=755] And so I'm thinking, what do you do?
[time=757] I say, Harry, you don't understand.
[time=759] I am going to be banished from my driver's license, banished Harry from the highway.
[time=765] You cannot go a multiple of the speed limit and not go to jail.
[time=770] Harry, you're going to be estranged from your car.
[time=773] Harry, they're going to hook something up and a tow truck's going to touch your car.
[time=778] Harry.
[time=779] And he's laughing.
[time=781] And I said, you quit laughing.
[time=783] I said, he will come up here and see you laughing and he will throw the book at me.
[time=787] Harry, I'm going to jail.
[time=788] I'm banished from my license.
[time=790] I'm banished from the highway.
[time=791] You're estranged from your car.
[time=792] Harry, this is horrible.
[time=796] Got my license in my hands.
[time=797] I got his insurance certificate because I had dealer plates.
[time=801] And I said, Harry, how did he get the window open?
[time=806] He said, you got to open the door.
[time=807] It's like a going door.
[time=809] Okay.
[time=810] Door goes up.
[time=812] In my presence to my left walks the highway state patrol.
[time=818] And his first question was with my head down like this, so what year is this?
[time=824] And I'm thinking, yeah, Harry goes 2006.
[time=829] The guy goes, all right.
[time=831] And I'm thinking, yeah.
[time=833] And he says, sir, the reason I stopped you and I'm, and I just have my head down and I got my license up and I'm thinking, I'm multiple of the speed limit.
[time=842] Where are we going to go?
[time=843] What jail are we going to go to?
[time=844] How am I going to tell Susan?
[time=846] Oh, it's funny you don't think about those things till right at that moment.
[time=850] He says, the reason I stopped you is you were going 89 and a 60.
[time=858] He walks away with my driver's license and I say, thank you.
[time=863] And Harry goes, Jesus, because I got news for where I wasn't doing 89.
[time=868] I have no idea what happened.
[time=870] And, really, I haven't, I haven't gotten a ticket in 20 years since I graduated from
[time=878] defensive driving school, this is true.
[time=883] With that night, I thought about a verse because that situation and that policeman was a lot like this verse and a lot like the heart of God.
[time=890] And I've been wrestling with this verse for months.
[time=894] And the verse is what we're going to explore today, if you want to stand up, I'll read it to you.
[time=898] This is this.
[time=903] Like water spilled on the ground which cannot be recovered so we must die, justice.
[time=910] But God does not take away life, mercy.
[time=915] Instead he devises ways so that a banished person may not remain estranged from him.
[time=923] Let's pray.
[time=925] And now God, as we explore the Scriptures and we explore your heart, may the words be yours and not mine.
[time=929] We love you and we praise you and we thank you for your mercies in waking us up today.
[time=934] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=936] You may be seated.
[time=938] Well, Harry's version of the story was, I guarantee you he devised a way.
[time=947] Harry's words, I guarantee you he devised a way so that he didn't have to take us in.
[time=954] I guarantee you he devised a way.
[time=958] And I didn't have to be banished from the highway.
[time=960] I didn't have to be banished from my license and Harry didn't have to be estranged from
[time=966] your car.
[time=967] But the question today is this, if the heart of God devises ways so that those who are
[time=975] banished from him may not, my daughter who's turning 16 and going to get her license in just a few months is looking at me laughing because she's never heard the story until right now.
[time=984] Is that right?
[time=986] Morning, please do not try this at home.
[time=989] The driver was a semi-professional who had driven 155 miles per hour on the Autobahn for hours and hours and many occasions in Germany.
[time=996] Thank you.
[time=998] That was a private service announcement.
[time=999] All right.
[time=1000] So anyway, if, here's the question, if God devises ways so that those who are banished
[time=1007] may not remain estranged from him.
[time=1010] And if I have surrendered my life to God and his spirit dwells in me, then the question
[time=1016] is, do I?
[time=1019] Do I?
[time=1020] Is my life characterized and known by devising ways so that those who are banished from God do not remain estranged from him?
[time=1028] And it's really amazing.
[time=1029] It's really amazing the words that are selected in this verse because life, God does not take
[time=1036] away life and Latin is literally, God does not will the destruction of the soul.
[time=1043] God does not desire to take away, listen to this now, the breath of life, Nefeshen Hebrew.
[time=1050] Life, soul, breath.
[time=1053] And what we're going to look at today is just two simple things to bring in the new year, two simple things that would allow us to be part of God devising ways so that those
[time=1065] who are banished may not remain estranged from him, so that those who are banished may not lose the breath of life and it's real simple, if you want to write it down, it's real simple.
[time=1073] Number one is, inhale the breath of life from God.
[time=1078] Inhale the breath of life from God and number two is exhale that breath of life to others.
[time=1090] Let me just give you the background of the verse.
[time=1093] King David had a son, his oldest son Amnon, and he was in love, Amnon was in love with
[time=1099] his half-sister Tamar, and he devised a way, an evil way, to be with Tamar, and he was
[time=1107] love sick for her, but when he gets with her he rapes her and then despises her after that example.
[time=1113] Well Tamar was the full sister of Absalom, Absalom waits two years, and Absalom devises
[time=1120] a way to have his men murder Amnon.
[time=1126] Now David, who was furious about Amnon raping Tamar, did nothing, there was no banishment,
[time=1132] but Absalom knew that he would probably be banished for this act, and so Absalom takes
[time=1139] off, and he goes to the land of his mother where his grandfather would have been king,
[time=1146] Yeshua, and he stays there for years, and it says in the text that David's heart longed
[time=1155] for Absalom.
[time=1156] Now David's right-hand man, Joab, knew this, it was his right-hand military guy, and he knew this, and I think partially because of military protection, partially because of
[time=1167] his relationship with David, and I think hugely because, and we miss this so much when we read the Bible, especially the Old Testament, to be reconciled with God, see what we're
[time=1178] doing today is we're peering into the heart of God, we're not necessarily looking at man, we're looking into the heart of God, a God who devises ways so that those who are banished
[time=1188] may not be a strange, remain estranged from him, and if the spirit of God is in me, then
[time=1194] does my life look like that?
[time=1196] Do I look like my life devises ways so that those who are banished not remain estranged from him?
[time=1201] I think that's a huge reason being reconciled with God, that Joab goes to this wise woman
[time=1207] of Tukoa.
[time=1208] You want to lift up Tukoa, we have Tukoa right here, she's one of our newest attendees
[time=1214] in the congregation, we can welcome her in the new year, that's Tukoa.
[time=1221] Tukoa was about 10 miles south of Jerusalem, and Joab coaxed the wise woman of Tukoa to come and present a parable to David, very much like Nathan and with a parable regarding
[time=1232] Bathsheba, and so the wise woman of Tukoa comes and presents this parable, it was a legal proceeding, and it's very similar to what's going on in David's life.
[time=1242] She says, "I had two sons, nobody was there to stop him, one killed the other, and now they want to take away, the avenger of blood wants to take away, my one and only son, my
[time=1252] heir, my survival," and David said, "No, no problem," and then she's real in a sweet
[time=1260] way, then she tells him this verse, "Like water spilled on the ground, that cannot be recovered, so we must die, justice, but God doesn't take away life, God doesn't take away the breath of life, God doesn't desire the extinguishing of the soul, mercy, instead
[time=1278] he devises ways so that those who are banished from him," this is his heart, "may not remain estranged," grace, and she tells him this, and David figures out that Joab put her up
[time=1290] to it, and she tells him in a real sweet way that he did, and David sort of reconciles with Absalom based on the parable, but the question today is if God devises ways so
[time=1304] that a banished person may not remain estranged from him, and his spirit draws in me is my
[time=1312] life characterized and known by that, devising ways so that those who are banished may not
[time=1319] remain estranged from him, and the first thing we do to have this lived out in us is number
[time=1326] one, inhale the breath of life from God, and here's what I want you to write under that, inhale the breath of life from God, I want you to write down, remember that we were banished, I think this was going on in David's heart, remember that we were banished, and God devised a way for us to not remain estranged, remember that we were banished, and God devised a way
[time=1348] for us not to remain estranged, remember that we were banished, and God devised a way for
[time=1358] us not to remain estranged, like water spilled on the ground which cannot be recovered so we must die, Amnon was dead, and he couldn't be brought back, and maybe you got a situation
[time=1368] in your life, and you're holding on to it, and you can't change the past, and you got to let go of it, and that's what she's saying right here, we're all going to die, God is just, we have one shot at this, Hebrews 927 I think says we're going to all die, we live
[time=1380] once, we die once, and we face judgment, this is the justice of God, according to law, Amnon should not have had sex with his sister, and the penalty was to be banished, but God does
[time=1391] not take away life, Nefesh, life, soul, breath, mercy of God, God does not take away life,
[time=1403] that's the mercy of God, God's heart is just, like water spilled on the ground which cannot be recovered so we must die, God's heart is merciful, God does not take away life, God does not will the destruction of the soul, God does not desire to take away the breath of life, instead he devises ways so that a banished person may not remain estranged
[time=1423] from him, grace, see this devising ways, this creative, intentional, active, devising of ways of God's heart so that those who are banished may not remain estranged from him,
[time=1435] is being contrasted with the verse above this, look at 2 Samuel 14, 13, the woman which he's
[time=1442] trying to tell David that he's actually the situation that she had described, why then have you devised a thing like this, why have you devised a thing like this, see, we're
[time=1454] going to take that creative, intentional, active ability to devise, to create, and we
[time=1460] are going to take this breath of life from God and keep it for ourselves and create ways
[time=1466] to let banished people go, where banished people go, or we're going to take in this
[time=1472] breath of life of God and we're going to be part of God devising ways so that those who
[time=1478] are banished may not remain estranged from him, we're going to go one way or the other, and my question to you, January 1st, 2006 is will you take that breath of God, will you
[time=1491] inhale that and remember that we were once banished, and he devised a way for us not to be estranged
[time=1498] from him, will you take that breath and will you be part of God devising ways so that those who are
[time=1505] banished may not remain estranged from him, it's interesting, Proverbs 6, 18 says God hates a heart
[time=1511] that devises wicked schemes, and we're going to go one way or the other, we're going to devise
[time=1517] wicked schemes or we're going to be part of God devising ways so that those who are banished may not remain estranged from him, and see the first step, the first step or the first movement in evangelism is not toward lost people, it is toward God, and to inhale that breath of life,
[time=1532] and remember that I was once banished, and he devised a way for me to not remain estranged from
[time=1538] him, I want to look at God's heart, let me just show you quickly a few verses, Genesis 2-7, Genesis 2-7 says the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his
[time=1550] nostrils, the breath of life by grace, and this man became a living being, this life that I was
[time=1558] looking for in that Mercedes, this fast heartbeat, this accelerated heartbeat, this accelerated breathing,
[time=1564] this accelerated driving in that doesn't compare at all to being in the midst of someone
[time=1573] who surrenders his or her heart to Christ as Savior and Lord, that is what the breath of life that
[time=1580] God gave us was designed to do, was designed to be exhaled into the life of others, well you know
[time=1586] that sin entered the garden much like my sin on driving on the highway, and let's jump down to
[time=1594] verses 22, 3-22, Genesis 3-22, and the Lord God said the man has now become like one of us,
[time=1602] knowing good and evil, he must not be allowed experiencing good and evil, he must not
[time=1608] and determining it for himself, he must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and live forever, next verse, so the Lord God banished him from the garden of Eden
[time=1621] to work the ground which he had been taking, a couple of things going on there, one is physical death is actually the mercy of God that we don't live in this sinful state forever because we have
[time=1632] sin, and each one of us because of our sin had been banished from this free flowing,
[time=1638] saving gracious relationship with the God of the universe, and God devised a way for us to be
[time=1646] reconciled to him, God devised a way, God devised a way. Justice, we had to die, mercy,
[time=1658] God doesn't take away the breath of life, doesn't desire to do that. Grace, Genesis 3-15,
[time=1665] theologians call it the first preaching of the gospel, and it talks about the Christ, it doesn't
[time=1672] say Christ himself, but it talks about this idea that somebody's going to come, and somebody's going to graciously give us life, and that breath of life will continue. Inhale the breath of life from
[time=1686] God, remember that we were banished, and God devised a way for us not to remain estranged from him, and we see that then throughout the Scriptures, that though banished God devised a way, Deuteronomy 30, and Deuteronomy 30 verses 4 and 5, or we might jump to verse 1, that's okay,
[time=1702] when all these blessings and curses I have set before you come upon you. He's talking to the people of God coming out of Egypt, come upon you, and you take them to heart wherever the Lord your God disperses you among the nations, and when you and your children return to the Lord, your God, and obey him with all your heart, and with all your soul according to everything I command you today, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you, even if you have been banished
[time=1732] to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring
[time=1738] you back. He will bring you to the land that belonged to your fathers, and you will take possession
[time=1745] of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers. God will devise a way.
[time=1750] In 2 Kings 13, 23, several years after David's life, but the Lord was gracious. This is all by
[time=1759] grace. This breath of life is by grace, undeserved, loved, unmerited favor, but the Lord was gracious to them. This is his heart, and had compassion, and showed concern for them of his covenant with
[time=1770] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. To this day he has been unwilling to destroy them or banish them, from his presence. This is the heart of God, that he would devise a way so that those who are
[time=1781] banished to me not remain estranged, and the question is if the Spirit of God is alive and dwelling in me, then do I look like my life devises ways so that those who are banished
[time=1794] will not remain estranged from him. Had a guy walk up to me one Sunday morning here, and he said,
[time=1802] "Dude, I've got to pray with you." He said, "My life at work is just not what it has been,
[time=1809] and I can't believe some of the things I'm saying and doing." He said, "I just need prayer right now. Translate it. I'm not exhaling the life of God in the workplace." So we went in the
[time=1822] harvest room, and then we prayed, and we talked about inhaling the life of God first. And I said,
[time=1830] you know, there's really three ways that I do this, remembering that I was banished and that God devised a way for me not to remain estranged from him, three ways. And I want you to write these three ways down. This is me, but I find that if I start my day this way, my day's a whole lot
[time=1845] different. If I don't do this on a given day, my day is a whole lot different in a bad way.
[time=1851] And there are three things. I want to write them down. Worship, word, work out. Write that down.
[time=1858] Worship, word, work out. I try to start every morning by having some worship music,
[time=1865] either with an iPod or a DVD, some element of worship music. Music affects the central nervous
[time=1873] system, but worship music not only affects the central nervous system, but there's movement in my
[time=1879] soul, movement of this breath of life that I inhale from God in my soul that affects me
[time=1886] in a positive way. And it would do the same for you. Worship, and by that mean music. Now it might not be music for you. It might be going outside and connecting with God in some other way through creation or serving somewhere or something like that, but that's what does it for me.
[time=1901] Second one is word. I inhale the word of God. I inhale the word of God. Nothing has changed my
[time=1908] life. God has not used a tool to change my life any more than he has used the word of God. I've
[time=1915] tried to read through a different translation for many, many years now every six months or a year, and I'm telling you it is powerful. I cannot oversell this. And here's what I want to ask you to do.
[time=1925] Would you be willing in 2006 and start today to read through the Bible in a year? It's only
[time=1931] four chapters. You'll get done a little bit before the end of the year. It's only four chapters, and I'd encourage you to read three in the old and one in the new every day. Three in the old, one in the new, three in the old, one in the new. If you go with the old only and then get to the new, you might get a little frustrated around chronicles and stop. But if you go three in the old, one in the new, three in the old, one in the new, I try to book in my day with the word of God. And I'm telling you when you inhale the word of God, it is powerful what it does to you. And I would never do that without prayer. Sometimes I do forget, and I don't pray, but you need to pray when you're reading the word of God because it's a tool for you to inhale the breath of God, the breath of life from God,
[time=1966] and His Holy Spirit. And you've got to ask God, "God, help me here. Breathe into my life with your
[time=1973] word." And I'm telling you it's so powerful. Now some of you are saying, "Oh, Mitch, I can't do that." It's not going to take very long, but you think, "Oh, I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it." Well, then read the New Testament, chapter, yeah, chapter a day. Get through the New Testament this year. And I want to throw in there, read a chapter of Proverbs a day, 31 chapters, 31 days of the month
[time=1992] most of the time, a chapter for every day. It is the ultimate marketplace business book. It is the ultimate one. And I've done it for many, many years, about every year since I've been out of defensive driver's training. And it has been so fresh and so new every day, every day. And so I
[time=2008] encourage you, please, I cannot oversell this. Would you please consider inhaling the word of God
[time=2014] and reading four chapters a day and reading through the word of God and inhaling that for your life this year? And what God would do with that? Oh, my goodness, what God would do with that. Not only for your life, but for this church and for this culture. And then finally, work out. For some of
[time=2030] you, it might be walking, but there's something about my body going from that anaerobic to aerobic
[time=2037] state and the sweat and the breath of life coming in and exhaling that breath. And that's where most of the waste that exits our body comes from. And I'm going to come back to that is through breathing.
[time=2049] And there's just something about that norepinephrine and the endorphine that goes through our body and gives us this relaxed energy for the rest of the day. Now, if I leave this one out, it affects my
[time=2060] day. But I'm telling you to take that time and to inhale the breath of life from God to remember
[time=2066] in that moment in the morning that we were banished and God devised a way for us not to remain estranged
[time=2072] and to worship and to take inhaled worship and to inhale the word and to inhale through that working out. There's something powerful that happens as we breathe in a breath of life from God.
[time=2084] I've asked the team to come up because, you know, I was wondering as I read this,
[time=2090] I wonder if David caught this phrase from this woman, this wise one with Takoa,
[time=2100] that like water spilled on the ground, we all must die. It can't be recovered justice.
[time=2107] But God does not take away life. God does not desire to destruct this breath of life,
[time=2114] destroy this breath of life, mercy. But God devises ways so that those who are banished may
[time=2123] not remain estranged from Him. And the first step people to this lost world is not toward the lost
[time=2131] people. It's toward God. And it's inhaling that breath of life from Him. And I wonder, did David get this? Did David get it and apply it to his life, a man whose life is bookended in the scriptures with a man after God's own heart? Did he get it? Did he get that he inhaled the breath of life from God? And you remember that you were once banished and God devised a way for you not to remain estranged from Him. And then I found Psalm 103. I want you to listen to this.
[time=2160] Praise the Lord, O my soul. All my inmost being praises Holy Name.
[time=2167] Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits who forgives all your sins
[time=2175] and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and
[time=2187] compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the
[time=2196] eagles that breath of life. The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
[time=2203] He may known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel. The Lord is compassionate
[time=2211] and gracious. Slow to anger, a bounding in love. He will not always accuse nor will he harbor his
[time=2219] anger forever. He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
[time=2227] God does not do a one-for-one punishment of sin. For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
[time=2233] so great is His love for those who fear Him. As far as the east is from the west, so far He has removed our transgressions from us. As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has
[time=2245] compassion on those who fear him. For he knows how we are formed. He remembers that we are dust and
[time=2253] he breathed life into it. As for man, his days are like grass, he flourishes like a flower of the field. The wind blows over it and is gone and its place remembers it no more. But from everlasting
[time=2264] to everlasting, the Lord's love is with those who fear him and his righteousness with their children's children. But those who keep his covenant remember to obey his precepts. The Lord has
[time=2274] established his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Praise the Lord, you as angels,
[time=2280] you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word. Praise the Lord, all his heavenly hosts,
[time=2286] you as servants who do his will. Praise the Lord, all his works everywhere in his dominion.
[time=2291] Praise the Lord, oh my soul, all the breath of life. I think David got it. I think David got it.
[time=2301] God that God was just, the water spilled on the ground so we must die.
[time=2308] God doesn't take away life, mercy. Instead he devised a way so that when I was banished,
[time=2317] I did not remain estranged from him, grace. So I invite you now to sing with Corbin and the team
[time=2323] about that amazing grace. And as you do, inhale that breath of life from God right now and remember
[time=2331] that you were banished and God devised a way so that you would not remain estranged. Why don't you stand. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=2365] I once was lost, but now we found, was blind, but now I see.
[time=2395] 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear. And grace, life is relieved.
[time=2425] How precious can that grace appear. Be out, right first, be lead.
[time=2452] We've been, and lo and we've been there, 10,000 years.
[time=2468] By shining as the sun. We know last days to sing, God's dreams.
[time=2493] Then when we first begun, Hebrews 11 says that David didn't get to see. He didn't get to see
[time=2516] the real good stuff, because that was Jesus Christ. And Jesus said in John 14, 6, "I am the way."
[time=2524] Christ is the ways, the grace of God, so that we can have the breath of life.
[time=2532] And when we say I deserve justice, God, and we ask for mercy, He gives us grace,
[time=2541] undeserved love, unmerited favor. Justice, what we deserve, mercy a little less than we deserve
[time=2548] in grace, that which we do not deserve. David said it this way. He restores my soul.
[time=2553] He restores my soul. So I want to pray this into our lives. And now, God, may it be so.
[time=2561] In 2006, God, may we inhale the breath of life from you.
[time=2572] May we remember, God, that we were banished in our sin.
[time=2575] You devised a way for us not to remain estranged. Not just the way in Christ, God,
[time=2584] but utilize the circumstances around us to draw us to yourself. Use people around us to draw us to yourself. God, we thank you for that. And we inhale that breath of life.
[time=2596] And we say thank you, God, for your grace. I've got a reminder that Jesus said in Luke 12, 48, to whom much is given, much is required, and that's grace. And we're required to exhale that grace.
[time=2607] And so may it be so, God, for these people in Jesus' name. Amen. You may be seated.
[time=2613] Well, as I said there in the prayer, it's not just about inhaling. Go ahead and inhale right now.
[time=2623] Just imagine if you're going to stay that way for the rest of your life. And yet, that's what so many you can exhale. That's what so many Christians want to do. We want to inhale that breath of life from God. We want to keep it for ourselves. And we never want to exhale it to others. And this is a second idea here that God, we take in that breath of life, we inhale it,
[time=2641] and we exhale it to others, that breath that's by grace. You know, there's a Hebrew scholar that's just produced a new translation of the first five books of the Bible, I think it's from California.
[time=2651] I'm not sure he's a Christian, but he is an expert in Hebrew, and he says in that Genesis 2-7 thing that God breathed in us the breath of life, that the thing that our translations miss is that it's not like a one-time deal. The idea in Hebrew is that God breathes in and breathes out.
[time=2666] God breathes in and breathes out. And there's this inhaling and this exhaling that's only from
[time=2672] God, the breath of life of the universe. And so we're designed to be part of that reconciliation
[time=2682] of others, of those who are banished to God, by exhaling that life that we breathe in from him.
[time=2688] And so write this down under exhale the breath of life to others, that we would yield to God's devising ways, yield to God's devising ways in me to help the banish not remain as strange.
[time=2698] It's just the last part of the verse. Yield to God's devising ways in me to help the banish not remain as strange. Yield to God's devising ways in me to help the banish
[time=2710] not remain as strange, to exhale the breath of life to others. It's in the New Testament too.
[time=2716] 2 Corinthians 5 verses 16 to 21, this is amazing to me. So from now on we regard no one from a
[time=2723] worldly point of view, though we once regarded Christ in this way we do so no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation, a new breath of life. The old is gone and the new has come. All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry
[time=2742] of reconciliation. So it's God's idea, it's God's idea that we inhale that breath of life,
[time=2748] that fact that we were banished and he devised a way, the way in Christ, and that we would exhale
[time=2754] that breath of life to others. And look what he says, that God was reconciling the world to himself, those who are opposed to Christ, to himself, in Christ, not counting men's sins against them by grace. He has committed to us the message of reconciliation, to exhale reconciliation to banish
[time=2770] people. We are therefore Christ ambassadors to inhale the breath of life of God and exhale the
[time=2776] breath of life of God to those who are banished as though God were making his appeal through us.
[time=2782] If my heart is truly like God's, then my life will look like an ambassador of the message of
[time=2789] reconciliation of Christ to Christ and I will look like my life devises ways so that those
[time=2796] are banished will not remain estranged. As if God were making his appeal through us, it's how he does it. We implore you on Christ behalf, be reconciled to God, have peace with God, have abundant life
[time=2808] with God. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us or the payment of sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. God is just and he has paid for all sin at
[time=2821] the cross of Jesus Christ, Hebrews 10-10. We cannot add a single thing to it, Hebrews 10-18.
[time=2826] And God says it's by mercy in Romans 9-16, it's by mercy that God chooses who's in and who's out.
[time=2833] And it's by grace that we have Christ. And we inhale that breath of life that we were once
[time=2839] banished and God devised a way for us not to remain estranged from him. And we're to exhale
[time=2845] that life, that breath of life to others, that justice, that mercy, that grace, that reconciliation
[time=2851] as Christ's ambassador. That's what we're supposed to do. That's the way God's designed it. That's the purposes for the breath of life so that they will be reconciled to God.
[time=2863] You know, remember those three words, worship, word, work out? Let's just write them down again
[time=2872] under this point. And remember I inhaled that worship of God. I inhaled that music. I inhaled
[time=2880] that moment of worshiping God. And so now I exhale that worship of God.
[time=2887] Remember I inhaled the word of God? Now I exhale the word of God to others. Remember how I inhaled
[time=2899] through that working out? Now I exhale by working out my salvation and connecting it with others.
[time=2909] Isn't that amazing? That what we breathed in from God, He's designed for us to breathe out.
[time=2915] And the first exhale actually is to God. It's actually to confess our sins to God. You might
[time=2922] want to write that down. Yaddha in Hebrew confess in the Old Testament is literally to exhale,
[time=2928] to exhale that waste, to breathe it out and give it back to God. And when we inhale that
[time=2934] brother life from God and realize that we were once banished and He devised a way so that we would not remain estranged from Him. When we inhaled that we can exhale back and confess our sin and confess our sin. But then 1 Peter 3, 15 talks about then how we exhale that to others. And it
[time=2952] says in your heart, set up our Christ as Lord. That's the worship. Worship God in your work or in
[time=2959] your home. Worship God out there. We inhaled worship in that morning through the music. But worship
[time=2965] God out there. Martin Luther said when a shoe cobbler makes a good pair of shoes he worships God, worship God with your life by in your heart setting apart Christ as Lord everywhere 24/7.
[time=2976] Students in school, on the court, on the field, wherever it is, worship God. Exhale God and worship.
[time=2982] But in your heart set up our Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you. It's the way it'll work when you worship God outside this place. Who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. That's the word of God. Remember I inhaled the word of the God that morning. I'm going to exhale the word of God now with gentleness and respect. With gentleness
[time=3002] and respect with total humility. It's like this. It's not actually, it's not like this. Proverbs 15 1 says, do you understand sir, sir, you have a little bit of an anger problem. Do you understand the Proverbs 15 1 says, the harsh word turns out, what's the harsh word do? Stirrs up anger.
[time=3017] And you start, you know, doing this. That's not the way. Here's the way. Here's the way you speak the word of God. Speak the word of God as if you inhaled that morning that you were once
[time=3028] banished. God devised a way for you not to be estranged from it. Be more like this, you know.
[time=3032] I'm struggling. Sometimes I lose my temper too. But I read Proverbs this morning and I'm working
[time=3040] on it and it says there that, you know, a harsh word stirrs up anger and a gentle answer turns away rather. I'm just trying to work on that and I'm trying to have that be that way for my life right here right now. That's the way to exhale the word of God with gentleness and respect.
[time=3054] But then this workout, your salvation, Philippians 2 12, this is so cool. Philippians 2 12 says,
[time=3061] therefore my dear friends, as you have always obeyed not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence continue to work out your salvation with fear and traveling, with humility, live it out and connect it to others with your story. Be able to work out your salvation and connect your salvation to others to live it out to work it out and connect your story with others.
[time=3082] Paul said it this way in 1 Corinthians 9 22. He said, I've become all things all men so that
[time=3088] some might be saved. Translation, I'm connecting. I'm inhaling. Paul says this breath of life from
[time=3094] God and I'm exhaling it to others. That's the way God designed it. Worship, word, workout.
[time=3098] You know, here's a story that I would hope would become just normal here.
[time=3108] And it's a story of a girl when she was 15. She was saved at a Billy Graham concert. She told me
[time=3117] she went because back then he was really cute. So I don't know what that's called, some kind of attraction of angelism or something. You know, so she went and she was saved. And she kind of
[time=3128] maintained control of her own life and she's taught elementary school down the road here.
[time=3132] And she gets her bulletin board all prepared in this public school. Beautiful outline. She said
[time=3138] of evolution. And she said there was this teacher across the hall and she said, oh my goodness,
[time=3144] what's that? And she said, that's my bulletin board on evolution. She said, you go to church anywhere. And she said, no. And she exhaled that breath of life to this lady. And she said, why don't you come with me? And they went to Emmanuel Baptist where Tom Younger was past her.
[time=3157] And that woman began to grow. The woman who gave her life at the Billy Graham concert began to grow.
[time=3163] Be able to inhale this breath of life and exhale this breath of life from God. And that was happy waltz who leads teams here at the school. Well, happy and another teacher. Notice one day that
[time=3176] there was a student who had quite a bit of a problem when they had a conference with their parents.
[time=3180] And they noticed that the parents were pretty much unchurched, not de-church, but pretty much
[time=3186] unchurched. And happy who inhales that breath of life from God and is exhaling it there in that moment says to the father of the child of the second grader, I think he said, she said, would
[time=3197] you be interested in talking with a guy named Mitch? And he said, sure. So I met with John.
[time=3205] And that first hour, that first week we became friends. The next week, that next hour,
[time=3212] a week later, he was stranded in his life to Christ his Savior and Lord in my office.
[time=3216] And it's all because happy inhales the breath of life of God and she exhaled it. And now we have
[time=3223] another guy inhaling the breath of life of God. Shana. Shana met a couple ladies who inhaled the
[time=3232] breath of life from God in a workplace where you don't share your faith. But their lives reflected something different in Shana's terms. And Shana pursued them and asked questions on her own outside that environment. And Shana began to come the common ground. And Shana would confess sins,
[time=3249] quite transparent. And it was almost humorous at times. But it was beautiful, the authenticity
[time=3255] that was embraced there. It wasn't long that Shana was in my office and she had been embraced by a community of believers here. And Shana surrounded her life to Christ as Savior and Lord.
[time=3267] It's just amazing that there she is inhaling the breath of life of God all because
[time=3274] two women inhaled the breath of life of God and they exhaled it to her.
[time=3278] It's amazing that that's God's design. And I want that to become commonplace here.
[time=3285] Not bringing people into my office, but you. You having those experiences yourself. And it'll happen. I promise you it'll happen if you'll do what we're talking about today. If you would inhale the breath of life of God and realize that you are once banished and God devised a way.
[time=3300] I wondered if David got it and I looked at Psalm 145 and it's very interesting. Psalm 145.
[time=3307] David says, "I will exalt you, my God, the King. I will praise your name forever and ever.
[time=3313] Every day I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever." I'll exhale it. "Great as the Lord and most worthy of praise is greatness. No one can fathom.
[time=3323] No one generation will commend your works to another. They will tell you of your mighty works.
[time=3327] They will tell of your mighty acts. They will exhale. They will speak. They will exhale of the glorious splendor of your majesty. And I will meditate on your wonderful works. They will tell they will exhale of the power of your awesome works. And I will proclaim I will exhale your great deeds. They will celebrate. They will exhale your abundant goodness. And joyful is seeing. They will exhale of your righteousness. The Lord is gracious and compassionate,
[time=3352] slow to anger and rich in love. The Lord is good to all. He has compassion on all he has made. What
[time=3359] about exhaling that? All you have made will praise you, O Lord. Your saints will extol you. They will
[time=3365] tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your might so that all men may know your mighty
[time=3373] acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom. Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and your dominion endures for all generations. The Lord is faithful to all his promises and loving toward
[time=3383] all he has made. The Lord upholds all those who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down. The eyes
[time=3389] of all look to you and you give them their food at the proper time. You open your hand and satisfy
[time=3396] the desires of every living thing. The Lord is righteous in all his ways and loving toward all
[time=3403] he has made. The Lord is near to all who call on him. To all who call on him in truth. He fulfills
[time=3411] the desires of those who fear him. He hears their cry and saves them. The Lord watches over all who
[time=3417] love him but all the wicked he will destroy. My mouth will speak. I will exhale and praise
[time=3425] of the Lord. Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever. I'm going to invite you to
[time=3432] stand and sing with the team. I want you to just exhale to God. Maybe it's confessing of sin. Maybe
[time=3440] it's just worshiping God but I want you to respond to God based on that breath of life that he's given you that you've inhaled that you'll exhale that to him and that you will exhale that breath of life to others that grace.
[time=3479] He has delivered me from all fear. He has said my feet upon the ground.
[time=3505] I will not be moved. I'll stay of the Lord. You are my sheep. My strength. My nourishment.
[time=3526] Will it enter my shells? Strong tower. My belly pairs their mouth in time of year. So this next verse will step.
[time=3556] Come have I in heaven but you and there's none.
