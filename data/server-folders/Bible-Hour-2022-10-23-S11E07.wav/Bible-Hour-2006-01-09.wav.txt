[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=58] and on earth; therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit."
[time=80] I'm teaching them to observe all I have to command you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=91] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=97] [MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=111] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=147] And we are really thankful that this group is here.
[time=151] These are some good friends of mine, and I want to invite Marshall White if he would to come on out. Marshall has become a good friend. Welcome, Marshall White, please.
[time=162] [APPLAUSE]
[time=168] It was about two or three years ago that I met Marshall, and in meeting Marshall I met a whole bunch of others who have become friends.
[time=174] This standing behind us this morning, this is the embodiment of what is called the Unity Performing Arts Foundation.
[time=181] It is a wonderful organization, and part of it is this Voices of Unity Choir.
[time=186] These young people, God has gifted them, and God has put it on their hearts to expand and grow them in their gifting.
[time=192] Not only musically, but even just as young people, as young men and young women, and Marshall and his team give a great deal of time and effort to develop them as young people,
[time=202] and as musicians and as artists, and they are here this morning to just continue to share with us in worship.
[time=209] And I'm just so thankful that they could be here today. Corbin's going to come and join him on this song.
[time=214] Why don't you just stand? You're going to do it anyway, so you might as well just stand at the beginning.
[time=218] [MUSIC][MUSIC] He came to live, live a perfect life, he came to be a living word out of light, he came to die, so he'd be reconciled.
[time=245] He came to rise, to show his power and mind.
[time=251] [MUSIC] That's why we bow down, that's worshiping, 'cause he gave me his everything.
[time=273] He gave me his everything.
[time=277] [MUSIC][MUSIC] He came to live, live a perfect life, he came to be our concrete king and friend, he came to heal.
[time=297] [MUSIC][MUSIC] That's why we praise him, that's why we pray, that's why we offer him our everything.
[time=344] [MUSIC] That's why we bow down, that's why we pray, that's why we pray, that's why we offer him our everything.
[time=360] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=861] According to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience, among them we too, all of us, formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[time=878] And we're by nature, children of wrath, even as the rest, but God, one of the greatest verses in my opinion in the entire Bible, but God, being rich in what?
[time=889] Because of his great one, but God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us, even when we were what, dead in our transgressions, made us alive, together with Christ, by grace you have been saved.
[time=910] There's absolutely nothing like it. To see lives, to see human souls being made completely new. For 2 Corinthians 5, the old has gone, the new has come.
[time=923] Spiritual life transformation through salvation, my friends, absolutely nothing like it.
[time=933] And what's even more amazing in some ways to me, and what I find just as unspeakable, and something I'm just as grateful for, is getting to see these transformed lives.
[time=945] Follow me now. These transformed lives, these transformed lives at the point of salvation, to get to see somebody miraculously made new.
[time=954] That is an absolute thrill. To get to see a transformed life that then begins to move, that then begins to grow and move forward in spiritual maturity to transformed living is just as thrilling.
[time=971] To see a transformed life that takes root and begins to move toward transformed living, to see salvation, amen, moving toward sanctification is utterly and deeply thrilling.
[time=991] There is something about it that amazes me. Seeing someone come to faith in Christ and experience that initial hard and life transformation is a miracle I don't think I'll ever get used to.
[time=1002] Just as significant, though, is when we see that new faith taking root and beginning to produce spiritual fruit that is so amazing to see somebody who was once here beginning to think differently, beginning to choose differently, beginning to respond
[time=1020] to all of life differently, to see them value things differently, to see them walk through the everyday of their life with family and friends and at work spiritually growing and maturing in their faith.
[time=1035] What a gift. What an absolute thrill. There's nothing like transformed living being transformed. Paul talked about that in Romans 12. Why don't you turn there?
[time=1052] Transformed living. It's a different thing. Things change. How do you like our frog up there?
[time=1064] I didn't even notice that first hour and I'm standing here right now looking at the screen going, there's a frog on a pillow with a crown.
[time=1073] They are a creative bunch up there. Romans 12, the Paul knew all about this. My friends, Paul begged you. Paul begs you and I to live this way.
[time=1088] Romans 12, 1, therefore I urge you. There's the begging. I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God to present your bodies, a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of worship
[time=1102] and do not be. Now we're going to talk about living. Don't be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=1118] He says there in that passage in Romans 12, 1 and 2 that we have been called, not to living that is conformed. We've talked about this before. That word conformed in the Greek there in that text and that passage, it means don't live in a way whereby you are pretending.
[time=1136] That word in the Greek means to pretend. It means to act. It means it was a dramatic term that meant to put on a mask. He says I am begging you. Don't live in a way that is fake.
[time=1147] That is inconsistent. Don't live outwardly. Inconsistent with what is a reality in your renewed, regenerate, redeemed heart.
[time=1159] Don't be conformed to this world. No, he says be you. Live saved, live redeemed, be transformed, he says. We've been called not to conformity but to transformed living.
[time=1175] Living out externally, that which is consistent with our spiritual reality. The definition I've put on the screen for you. You can write this down. It's just a good one to keep in mind any time you hear about.
[time=1187] Any time you think about transformed living, it is the spiritual alignment.
[time=1193] Follow that. It's really simple. It's the spiritual alignment of my external expressions with the internal reality of a heart that has been redeemed.
[time=1204] A heart that has been saved. A heart that has been restored and justified. All of Romans talks about this saving work of God in your life.
[time=1214] And he says now align them. Live externally, consistent with the internal reality of your salvation.
[time=1222] Transformed living. It's when my redeemed heart is being accurately expressed in transformed living.
[time=1237] Now I wonder if there's anybody in the room. After having had just that brief conversation, I wonder if there's anybody here in the room that would be interested.
[time=1249] In understanding and seeing more clearly what transformed living actually would look like.
[time=1257] Paul begs you and I to live this way. God's word calls us to this kind of life.
[time=1263] And the amazing thing is if you just drop down a few verses to chapter 12 verses 9 through 21, which is where we'll be this morning.
[time=1271] And for the next couple of weeks we see here in this passage this incredibly clear, incredibly practical, very forthright listing of what transformed living actually will entail.
[time=1287] And if you like me, because I'll tell you I am, I'm interested. The more I read this over the last couple of weeks, the more I prayed about it, the more I looked at my own life.
[time=1298] The more I realized the implications of this great truth, the more I sensed you and I needed to spend some time looking closely and personally and honestly had what a transformed life really looks like as it lives out the truth that God has called us to.
[time=1316] And so I want to invite you. I want to invite each and every one of you to what we'll be. I'm sure a few weeks of just making our way, verse by verse, through this passage, Romans 12, 9 to 21, transformed living.
[time=1331] What it looks like. Now watch this. As Paul lays this out for us. He begins in verse 9. He continues through the text and he'll give us in the entire text for different categories, if you will.
[time=1345] Categories maybe isn't the best word. He'll give us four different arenas of life that you and I need to give some thought to, that you and I need to be sensitive to, that you and I need to take these truths and apply them in.
[time=1358] The first arena of life is what we'll look at this morning. Paul speaks to your personal life.
[time=1366] Verse 9 has three, three great truths. And in verse 9 these initial three truths that we'll look at have to do with your and with my personal life.
[time=1381] We'll move on as the passage continues. We'll look at some things having to do with our life with others, our life within the body of Christ. And even at the end of the passage, our life with those who don't like us, our lives with enemies.
[time=1396] And in all of it, an amazing picture is painted of transformed living and choosing and deciding and attitudes and the posture of the heart.
[time=1409] And I'd love for you just in honor of God's word. Would you stand with me this morning and allow me to read through this great passage with you Romans 12, 9 to 21.
[time=1420] It says let love be without hypocrisy, abhor what is evil, cling to what is good.
[time=1426] Be devoted to one another and brotherly love. Give preference to one another in honor, not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.
[time=1437] Rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer, contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.
[time=1445] Bless those, verse 14, who persecute you.
[time=1449] Bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep.
[time=1455] Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not be haughty or proud in mind, but associate with the lowly.
[time=1464] Do not be wise in your own estimation. Never pay back evil for evil to anyone.
[time=1470] Respect what is right in the sight of all men, if possible. So far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
[time=1479] Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God for it has written vengeance his mind.
[time=1485] I will repay, says the Lord, but if your enemy is hungry, feed him, and if he is thirsty, give him a drink.
[time=1493] For in so doing you will keep burning coals on his head. Verse 21, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[time=1503] Pray with me, would you, Father God, we expectantly and humbly, and so very thankfully, God, we stand before you here in your presence this morning.
[time=1519] We thank you, God, collectively. As a group of people gathered here in this room, we thank you for the opportunity we've had already this morning.
[time=1527] To bask in your presence, to enjoy God, the sweet fellowship of your people, to be encouraged by those who have come to encourage us.
[time=1537] And Father, now we come to Your Word, and we pray, God, that Your Word would do what only Your Word can do.
[time=1543] God, that it would see and penetrate deep into the heart and soul of every person in this room. God, the already convinced and those that continue to search.
[time=1555] God, we pray that the Spirit of God and the Word of God would teach us and grow us and show us new things about you.
[time=1562] Remind us of things that we've forgotten. God, as we open ourselves to what You would have for us today, we pray, God, that You would do with us whatever You need.
[time=1572] So that we could be a people who would bring great glory to You.
[time=1577] Thank You for this time. We pray, God, You're blessing on it, and we thank You for the privilege of being together in Your Son's name.
[time=1585] We pray, amen. You can be seated.
[time=1589] Well, what do you say we just jump right in?
[time=1592] Transformed living, if you're interested in gaining a clearer understanding of what that looks like, just follow along, will you?
[time=1600] And first of all, verse nine deals with Your personal life. You and I, and the personal component of our world.
[time=1607] Number one, He says, "Let love be without hypocrisy." Stop right there. "Let love be without hypocrisy."
[time=1615] Write this down, my friends. He begins this passage with the Supreme virtue in the entire Christian life.
[time=1626] He says, "Love sincerely." You want to live a transformed life?
[time=1635] The first place He goes is the way that You love. He says, "Love sincerely."
[time=1643] First of all, I want you to see that in essence it is assumed. He doesn't say, "Love," does He?
[time=1647] He says, "Let Your love be without hypocrisy." He's assuming that Your love is there.
[time=1653] The word that's chosen there is the word agape. Agape love is to be a given in Your life and mind.
[time=1660] Love expressed selflessly in Your life and mind. It is the, as I mentioned, it is the Supreme virtue in all of the Christian experience.
[time=1670] Go to 1 Corinthians 13, if you will. Go to 1 Corinthians 13, just one book after Romans there.
[time=1677] You've come to 1 Corinthians 13. It's the love chapter. You've heard it a thousand times at weddings.
[time=1684] I've read it a thousand times at weddings. It's a great chapter. Look how it ends, verse 13.
[time=1690] But now faith, stop right there. Let me ask you, is faith a good thing? Yes or no? Say it. Yes.
[time=1696] But now faith, hope, stop there. Hope is hope a good thing? Yes or no? Yes.
[time=1701] But now faith, hope, and love abide these three. But the greatest of these is what? Say it.
[time=1708] Love, love, agape. You can write this down. It is a self-sacrificing affection.
[time=1717] And Your life, and Your choices, and Your relationships with Him and others is to be marked, first and foremost, by this sincere love.
[time=1727] A self-sacrificing affection, agape love is consumed when agape love is present.
[time=1734] Agape love is consumed with the needs of others. Agape love is consumed with the needs of your husband.
[time=1749] A self-sacrificing, self-giving. It is consumed with the needs of your wife.
[time=1758] It is absolutely taken back by the opportunity to offer itself to your children and to your friends and to your coworkers.
[time=1767] Agape love stops at nothing to selflessly communicate and evidence a readiness to give and come alongside whoever it might be that needs that love.
[time=1780] And watch this. Agape love, sincere love gives and is offered without, listen, without demand for reciprocation.
[time=1793] We have really, really fouled this one up, my friends.
[time=1803] Agape love is offered without demand for reciprocation.
[time=1808] To offer love with the demand that it be reciprocated is to love with hypocrisy because that is not love.
[time=1819] And see where it's all gone south, you see, is that love in its original design and the way God laid it out, God in relationship with us, God has longed, always has, has longed to be that source of life-giving, spirit-filling love.
[time=1837] The love of God, from the very beginning, God designed that love to be yours.
[time=1842] He, He designed to you to be filled up by Him and His love and what He brings.
[time=1851] God never designed you in that original design, that tank, that love tank that every one of us has was never designed by God to be filled with the love of a human being.
[time=1867] Ever, the garden, Adam and Eve, sin changed all of that, we got it all backwards.
[time=1875] And ever since the garden, you've been looking at me and I have been looking at you saying, "Why don't you love me the way I want you to?"
[time=1884] And it could be a mom and a daughter, it could be a son and a dad, it could be a husband and a wife.
[time=1890] But in God's design, He meant for you and I to be filled with the love that only He gives so that having been filled up with that love, we could turn to those in our life and give freely.
[time=1906] Give selflessly, give sacrificially, give often, give deeply, because I don't, my life and my existence isn't dependent on you loving me back.
[time=1917] I receive love and am filled with the love of God in my relationship with Christ.
[time=1925] To love with strings attached is to love with hypocrisy.
[time=1931] It flies in the face of God's design for agape.
[time=1935] And so He says to you and He says to me, "As we start this journey, and as we begin to paint this picture of transformed living, He says, "Are you?"
[time=1946] He asks you in essence, "Are you loving?" Sincerely, because that's what transformed people do.
[time=1953] They love without hypocrisy. They love genuinely and they love deeply and they love often.
[time=1960] And I hope you'll allow that truth to settle into your heart this morning wherever it settles in.
[time=1967] And if you need some encouragement, if you need some accountability, if you need a loving arm around you, or maybe even a loving pat on the back, let us know.
[time=1982] Let someone you know who you love and respect, let them know.
[time=1987] But understand that this all begins with sincere love.
[time=1990] Secondly, back to verse 9.
[time=1992] Let love be without hypocrisy.
[time=1994] You want to live a transformed life of whore, what is evil?
[time=1999] Some translations may read hate.
[time=2002] Hate what is evil.
[time=2004] We're going to have to love sincerely, my friends, and secondly, we are going to have to hate evil.
[time=2011] And I want to say this to you this morning, and I want to say it to you very honestly, and I want to say it to you very carefully.
[time=2018] That's a strong word.
[time=2022] We don't say that word in our home, right?
[time=2026] We try and really, really watch the use of the word hate.
[time=2033] Because hate, hate's a very, very serious word, and there comes with that word an enormous amount of implications.
[time=2045] And God's word reminds you and I this morning, my friends, listen, in this day, in this culture, in our lives, transformed living will include the utter and deep hatred
[time=2062] of evil.
[time=2065] And I believe that is a word from the Lord this morning that you and I need to hear and dwell on and think through very carefully.
[time=2073] Hating evil is the flip side of where this passage began, isn't it?
[time=2078] Hating evil is the flip side of love.
[time=2081] And you see the way it works is this in my intimate loving relationship with God.
[time=2087] I hate evil because guess who hates evil?
[time=2091] Who hates evil, ultimately?
[time=2093] God hates evil.
[time=2095] God abhors evil.
[time=2096] He despises evil and in my intimate and loving relationship with him, I, more and more so, God willing become like the Father and his hatred of that.
[time=2107] I begin to understand and see more clearly.
[time=2110] Look at Proverbs 6, 16 through 19, he'll come on the screen and listen, I don't believe these are the only things he hates, but the Holy Spirit, as he works here through the writer of Proverbs, he lists some things to give us an idea and a picture of the very fact that he does hate evil.
[time=2128] Look what it says, Proverbs 6, 16, there are six things which the Lord hates.
[time=2134] Yes, seven, which are an abomination to him, and then he starts in verse 17.
[time=2140] Hotty eyes, our passage has already referred to that.
[time=2144] Hotty eyes, a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood.
[time=2149] In verse 18 it says, "A heart that devises wicked plans." God hates it.
[time=2155] He hates it when you or I in our hearts sit there and privately and secretly and in our own little world.
[time=2163] The world divides our evil plans that we are going to execute on that one that we don't like, on that one that we're jealous of, on that one that we're bitter towards.
[time=2174] These evil plans, he hates it, feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness who utters lies and one who spreads strife among brothers.
[time=2189] Look at that last one there, I thought that was compelling in this list of all this evil stuff that God hates.
[time=2199] That last one there speaks to you and me and your willingness or mind, your readiness or mind to spread strife, to be divisive,
[time=2212] to in the body of Christ, harbor an attitude, speak a word, give yourself to an action that would fracture and divide and harm the fellowship of the family.
[time=2224] He says that's evil and he hates it when that happens.
[time=2230] That's why later I think in the passage we see it there, it says in verse 18 as far as it depends on you, be it what?
[time=2236] Be it peace with all men.
[time=2241] Psalm 9710 says to hate evil, you who love, write that down, 9710 says to hate evil, you who love the Lord.
[time=2251] Psalm 1014 says a perverse heart shall depart from me.
[time=2256] I will, listen, I will know, I will know, K-N-O-W, I will know, no evil.
[time=2266] Now just let that sink in for a moment. You who are interested this morning in transformed living, he says I will know, know evil.
[time=2279] How are you and I going to do that today?
[time=2288] How are we going to know, know evil? You know what I think it has to do with?
[time=2292] I think it has to do with a commitment on your part or mine not to watch it.
[time=2301] I think the person who is willing to say Psalm 9710, I hate evil because I love and know the Lord, Psalm 101, a perverse heart shall depart from me.
[time=2312] I will know, know evil. I think that person in essence is saying I won't watch it.
[time=2318] Any of it, how about just a little?
[time=2323] How about just a few minutes? How about just till it gets really bad?
[time=2330] I won't watch it. I won't listen to it. I won't flirt with it.
[time=2335] I won't get used to it. I won't read it. I won't click on it.
[time=2342] I'll say that again. I won't click on it. I won't scroll it. I won't condone it.
[time=2354] And I might sound a little like I'm up on my soapbox here. I'm sorry if I do, but this one just kind of...
[time=2362] I guess it's just a growing pet peeve of mine. I refuse to accept it as unavoidable or inevitable.
[time=2374] I will not feed my children or my home to its expanding influence because as some people tell me even some in the body of Christ, because some will just say that's just the way it is these days, Kelly.
[time=2388] They'll say to me, I mean, what are you going to do? Keep tabs on them 24/7?
[time=2400] And I say to them, as it relates my friend to evil, yeah, I am going to do my very best to lovingly, in relationship with them, keep tabs on them.
[time=2417] Because evil kills. And evil destroys. And evil diminishes. And evil has nothing good in it and all it wants is to ruin you and me and our kids.
[time=2432] It infuriates me when I see a lazy, half-hearted stand against evil because a parent doesn't have enough guts to say no to a kid or stand by God honoring principles.
[time=2453] Evil is killing. It's killing kids. And I'm not saying it's all our fault as parents. I'm saying you and I, we better think that one through really carefully.
[time=2470] And I want you to hear this too. Remember, this hate evil, of whore, what is evil, it comes in verse 9, which is three things.
[time=2481] We've seen two loves sincerely and hate evil. And I told you at the beginning, this had to do with what part of our life, a personal life.
[time=2492] So I just want you to hear me say this. All of that stuff, I just said it does infuriate me. What especially infuriates me is when I see it in me.
[time=2503] And I do.
[time=2507] And this isn't supposed to be about you and I walking around wagging our fingers in people's faces about their evil. This is hate evil. This is hate your evil.
[time=2521] Your tendencies, your patterns. Do you have a deep, do you? Do you have a deep, seething, burning hatred of your sin?
[time=2534] We usually do pretty well at hating others' sins. How do you feel about yours?
[time=2541] Do you despise the evil in you? When evil rears its ugly head, are you quick to flee from it? Do you confess it quickly or do you let it linger?
[time=2551] When it rears its ugly head in your heart or in your mind or in your life. Do you loiter there? Do you try and just kind of get a little bit of it?
[time=2561] Or do you just go? 1 Corinthians 10, write that down. 1 Corinthians 10, 14, 1 Corinthians 6, 10, say to flee from evil.
[time=2574] Those passages and others in the Scriptures tell us to flee from evil. When you look up the word flee in the Greek, guess what the word flee means in the Greek?
[time=2587] It means flee. It means run. It means, really. Yes, there is a figurative sense of you figuratively and internally kind of turning yourself away from it.
[time=2604] But the word means to move, to pick up your bag, to do whatever you've got to do and physically leave in your hatred of what you know is coming, if you don't.
[time=2625] Sometimes that's the best call. You know what, Joseph, back in Genesis, the story of Joseph. Joseph is a great example of this, my friends.
[time=2634] Joseph, most of you in the room know the story. Joseph was this incredible young man who loved God deeply.
[time=2640] The circumstances of his life had been very challenging. Some very jealous brothers had thrown him in a pit. They had sold him into slavery.
[time=2648] In slavery, he makes his way to Egypt. In Egypt, he's rescued from prison by this guy named Potiphar, who puts great trust in him.
[time=2655] And God's hand is on Joseph, and Joseph rises to the top of Potiphar's home. Potiphar gives him oversight and rule of everything.
[time=2664] He's in charge of his money. He's in charge of his cattle. He's in charge of his crops. Joseph is the man in Potiphar's home.
[time=2671] And God is using him in miraculous ways, and Potiphar decides to go with some guys to play golf for the weekend.
[time=2680] We don't really know where he went, but you never know. Potiphar's gone, leaves Joseph in charge, and then Potiphar's wife.
[time=2691] Potiphar's wife decides that she wants to execute a little bit of evil, and she finds Joseph attractive, and she goes to Joseph, and she physically comes at him, wanting him to lie with her in bed, lie with her.
[time=2708] And Joseph's seeing what was transpiring, realizing the evil that was coming his way. What does he do? Does he stop and think through the different options? Does he pause?
[time=2723] To maybe just have a little bit of fun without really doing something wrong? No, he leaves. He runs so quickly, and with such force, the text says that he leaves his cloak in her hands.
[time=2743] He runs from her that fast. Have you ever done that? Maybe it's not been that specific situation, but have you ever when faced with temptation, have you ever literally physically just left?
[time=2761] And you know what? Just to tell you, most of you know this, because most of you have, it works. When you leave, when you leave evil, when you draw away from evil, when you draw near to God, he draws near to you. James tells us that.
[time=2784] Other times, other times, and I want to say this carefully, I do not want to sound contradictory in this, but I want you to hear me, because I think at times, and you and I need great discernment in this, but at times, it goes both ways, because I believe there are times when what you and I need to do in the face of evil is absolutely run.
[time=2810] God's word in some other places, though, paints a picture of at times you and I standing and putting on our gloves and fighting for what is right, fighting, standing and fighting, standing in the gap against evil.
[time=2833] And you and I have got to be careful how we do that and when we do that and where we do that, but I'm reminded of David, if you go back to 1 Samuel 17, 1 Samuel 17, sorry, I can't see the clock, and that's not good for all of you.
[time=2848] Alright, there I can see it, thanks. First Samuel, go back to 1 Samuel 17, most of you in the room know the story of David, I love David. There's so much about David, I love, one of the things I love about David is his deep love for God.
[time=2863] I know there were times in his life where that waned, I know and you know there are times in his life when he chose other than his love for God, but I tell you what, when it's all said and done about David, when it's all said and done what you see as a man whose heart, whose heart was for God.
[time=2884] And even as a young boy, even as a 13, 14 year old, as we come back here to 1 Samuel 17, I want you to sense his love for what was right. His father had sent him, he was just a shepherd watching the sheep, his brothers were off fighting the Philistines, his father sends him to the front lines of the battle to deliver food and encouragement to his brothers.
[time=2905] And David, this young scrawny boy with this great love for God, makes his way to the front line as he delivers the food, it's there that he hears about and actually sees and experiences Goliath, the giant, the giant Philistine soldier.
[time=2920] And he hears what comes out of Goliath's mouth, he hears Goliath taunting the men, he hears Goliath in his evil, disregarding God, diminishing God in the army of God.
[time=2932] And look what it says in 1 Samuel 17, 26, then David spoke to the men who were standing by him saying what will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel.
[time=2946] For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should taunt the armies of the living God? Can you see that little puny 13 year old shepherd dirty from nights out in the pasture standing there on the front line of this battle saying what is up with the Philistine and the evil and the disregard for God?
[time=2974] And if you go to verse 48, 1 Samuel 17, 48, David had gone before Saul, it took some coaxing, but Saul allows David to go before the giant to face this evil.
[time=2989] They pray for him and they send him out and then in verse 48 watch this 1 Samuel 17, 48, then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, I love this, that David ran what? Quickly.
[time=3006] He ran not slowly, not fearfully, he ran quickly to act against evil. He ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine and David put his hand into his bag and he took from it a stone and he slung it.
[time=3021] He had a sling and he slung the stone and it struck the Philistine on his forehead and the stone sank into his forehead so that he fell on his face to the ground, thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone and he struck the Philistine and killed him.
[time=3040] But there was no sword in David's hand, then David ran and stood over, he stood on top of Goliath and took his sword, Goliath's sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it.
[time=3058] There. Take that, he says. I'm going to go back and tend my sheep. I love that. And I am not proposing that anybody go out and kill anybody.
[time=3082] No, but I am proposing that there may be times in your life and mind when we may need to take action lovingly, respectfully, but nonetheless forthrightly.
[time=3097] I'll tell you what, this is just a personal thing, just a private deal and this is by no means being mandated. I am by no means stipulating that you should.
[time=3110] And I'm just, I'm just admitting to you that I'm trying to think all this stuff through with you.
[time=3120] You know, my wife and I and our kids to date so far, I mean, talk to me in six months or a year, maybe it's going to change, but we still go to movies.
[time=3132] I'll still take myself and my wife or my kids into a movie theater and have a good time, you know, watching a good flick.
[time=3141] We work pretty hard at trying to figure out what we're going to go see and what we're not going to go see. We're just trying to be responsible, trying to help them, trying to help us.
[time=3150] Because I don't, you know, I don't want to be exposed to it. I'm going to get exposed to it and they're going to get exposed to it enough in this life without us planning to go see it.
[time=3163] You with me? So I were just trying to do our best. So we, you know, we go into the movie theater and I just got to tell you, I am tired.
[time=3172] I am officially tired of the previews. I'm just tired of, you don't have to clap, just listen. I'm just, I'm tired of broke back mountain and I'm tired of American.
[time=3186] I'm just tired of doing this in the, you know, just go, whoa, I thought we were here to see boom and then I see this.
[time=3195] And so anyway, I'm not going to, you're not going to see me on the news next week. I'm not fighting Hollywood, all right? I'm not going to do that.
[time=3204] But we're just not going to go to the previews anymore. Movie starts at 8.30, you and I know that means 8.50, and we're just going to go at 8.50.
[time=3214] I'm just tired. And I just want you to think through in your own life, you know, if you need to take a stand and fight and hate evil in a way that brings honor to God and we're not talking about dishonoring others,
[time=3231] you just probably should think it through. As far as the movies go, we now go 20 minutes late. And that's just how we're going to do it.
[time=3238] If that doesn't work, we'll try something else. Other times you fight. You hate it. You see it as an offense to your holy king, so you put on the gloves and you hold your ground.
[time=3251] Number three. Number three. Your love must be sincere. You've got to abhor what is evil and then what does your Bible say?
[time=3260] Cling, say it with me. Cling to what is good. And I want to leave you with this this morning. We'll come back and just pick it up right here. I hope you'll come back.
[time=3269] I hope you'll join us over the next several weeks as we look at transformed living. Let me just say this about clinging to what is good. I love this.
[time=3276] I was so thankful to read this and learn this again this past week. Watch this, my friends. The verb. The verb for to cling. He says cling to what is good. All right?
[time=3288] Have sincere love. Hate what is evil. Cling to what is good. The verb to cling in the Greek is Kaleo. And you don't care about that, but watch this.
[time=3301] Kaleo comes from the Greek word kola, which means I love this. Glue. Glue.
[time=3314] Just think about that. Just picture that for a moment. Transformed followers of Christ. They bind themselves to that which is good and right and true. They stick themselves. They become inseparable.
[time=3330] They get glued to that which is pure and right. They become attached permanently to that which is God honoring. And when you find something good, when you find something true, then you say it's different. See, I'll watch that. I'll listen to that. I'll condone that. I'll expose myself to that.
[time=3356] It reminds me of Philippians 4. Let's just turn there. Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians. Philippians 4, 8. Finally, brethren. Turn there if you would, please. Let's end with this.
[time=3368] Finally, brethren. Philippians 4, 8. Talking about clinging to what is good, being glued to that which is right and living life that way.
[time=3378] Finally, brethren. Whatever is true. Whatever is honorable. Whatever is right. Whatever is pure. Whatever is lovely. Whatever is of good repute. If there is any excellence and anything worthy of praise, dwell.
[time=3393] Cling to be glued to these things. The word dwell there means to ponder, to fixate, to be consumed with. That which is good.
[time=3411] You want to live a transformed life, my friends, you and I have to love sincerely without hypocrisy. We have got to, in a God honoring way, even while honoring others, hate and despise that which is evil and all that comes with it and cling so very tightly.
[time=3430] You ever had somebody cling to you? I remember going out to California last spring break. It was the first time all of our kids had gone back to California and I couldn't wait to get them out in the waves. They weren't so excited about getting in the waves.
[time=3445] They didn't want to get in the waves actually. I was absolutely broken hearted and I made one of them go with me. And I'll never forget her as she wrapped her arms around my neck and almost killed us both. She almost suffocated me. She was so terrified and she clung so tightly to my neck. The whole experience lasted about five minutes and we were done.
[time=3470] You hold on to what is good, my friends. I want that for you. Hold on to what is good. Hate what is evil and love. Love him and love me and all love you and love the person next to you sincerely without demand.
[time=3487] We'll come back and study some more. Would you stand with us? Father God, we come before you this morning and we ask that you would take this truth and change us. God that you would grow us into the people that you've called us to be.
[time=3499] That our external expressions would align with our internal spiritual reality so that we could be transformed in the way that we live. God do that, please, in us. Bring us back tonight.
[time=3514] God, bring us back this evening to enjoy and to be so thankful for and to encourage these young people who have given so much of their lives to express their gifts.
[time=3525] May we all come back and may you be honored and blessed for it's in your son's name and they all agreed and said amen.
