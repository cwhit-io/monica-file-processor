[time=307] How bow down and you will be by time.
[time=1478] How did we get to this relationship with a living God in which we get to live transformed lives.
[time=1486] Well what a journey it's been.
[time=1488] And you know the amazing thing about Romans.
[time=1492] Some of you in the room have read Romans.
[time=1494] Maybe you've studied the book of Romans.
[time=1496] Romans is an amazing story.
[time=1498] It is the unfolding of chapter by chapter, page by page.
[time=1502] It is the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.
[time=1506] It kind of just starts at the beginning and it just moves forward and it is an incredible picture that God paints of redemption.
[time=1516] And here we are in chapter 12 beginning to understand more clearly what it looks like to live redeemed transformed lives.
[time=1526] And I just kind of paused and thought you know how how did we get how did I get here.
[time=1532] Well I want to just very briefly and we're going to move here so stay with me.
[time=1538] Some of this will be on the screen.
[time=1540] I want to invite you to go back in your Bible to Romans chapter 1.
[time=1544] I want to just show you.
[time=1546] I want you to see it with your own eyes and take it in with your own heart.
[time=1550] This unfolding redemptive story that God lays out for us in Romans 1.
[time=1554] I want you to begin in Romans 1 18 because this is the reality my friends of where it begins is what it says.
[time=1562] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth and unrighteousness.
[time=1572] Life lived outside of relationship with God.
[time=1576] In our humanness we are sinful and in our sinfulness we are separated from God.
[time=1582] And oftentimes the sinfulness and the choices that come with it lead people like you and I have a personal relationship with Christ, it leads us to a thing called immorality.
[time=1594] It leads us to the dark side of life and choices whereby we grow further and further and further apart from Him.
[time=1604] And oftentimes it's very dark and oftentimes it's very it's full of compromise.
[time=1610] Oftentimes it's full of sins and those sins can begin to increase and they can begin to snowball and it turns into a rather rather dark, ominous picture of sin.
[time=1622] Immorality. Look at what it says in verse 32 of chapter 1.
[time=1626] And although they know the ordinance of God, I want you to stop right there. Back at the end of 18 it says the unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth and unrighteousness.
[time=1638] And in 32 it says, "And although they know the ordinance of God," listen, the word of God is very clear that the truth about God.
[time=1648] I know maybe you've never heard this and I know maybe you don't quite understand how it's true but I'm telling you today that God's word says it is.
[time=1658] The truth about God is known.
[time=1662] Everybody down deep inside understands basically the truth about God.
[time=1670] Some suppress it.
[time=1672] And some go a million miles an hour and a thousand miles in the other direction.
[time=1678] But the truth about God it says that in our conscience we know it to be true.
[time=1684] And yet so many times it's rejected and although they know the ordinance of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
[time=1700] You're a moral man.
[time=1702] But you know what?
[time=1704] Before you get too far wagging your finger oh you, oh you moral people, God says.
[time=1712] You who don't don't do the things that they do.
[time=1718] Those of you who don't live that lifestyle.
[time=1722] Those of you who don't frequent those places.
[time=1726] Those of you who don't even the moral man.
[time=1730] Even the good man is in trouble.
[time=1734] Chapter two.
[time=1736] Therefore you have no excuse every one of you who passes judgment, referring back to chapter one, for in that which you judge another you may sit there and wag your finger in the face of the disgusting and sick sin of the immoral.
[time=1752] You condemn yourself for you who judge practice the same things.
[time=1758] It may not sound the same and it may not look the same but it is sin and it is the same.
[time=1764] And whether it is the sin of the immoral or the sin of the moral, God tells us in Romans one and two that we're all in a lot of trouble.
[time=1774] Outside of relationship with him, look at chapter three.
[time=1778] The story continues to unfold.
[time=1780] Chapter three, verse ten.
[time=1782] There is none.
[time=1784] There is all of humanity.
[time=1786] There is none righteous, not even what?
[time=1789] Say it.
[time=1790] Not even one.
[time=1792] Verse 23, for all have what?
[time=1794] For all have sinned and false short of the glory of who?
[time=1798] God.
[time=1800] I've shared that truth with probably thousands of people.
[time=1804] I've never had one person look me in the eye and argue that point for all have sinned.
[time=1810] And in that sin have fallen short, have been separated from life and relationship with God.
[time=1818] And you know what?
[time=1819] If that's where the story ended, if that was the sum total of our spiritual reality, we'd all be sunk. But praise God for chapter four. Look what it says in chapter four, verse five.
[time=1832] But to the one who does not work, this isn't about what you could accomplish or I could accomplish.
[time=1838] What we could have done to somehow work, but believes in him.
[time=1842] Believes, not just a mental ascent, but a deep internal sense of surrendering all of you to him.
[time=1850] But to the one who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly. His faith is credited as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works. Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered.
[time=1870] Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account.
[time=1876] For this reason, amen.
[time=1878] For this reason, verse 16, it is by what?
[time=1882] Faith.
[time=1884] For this reason, it is by faith in order that it may be in accordance with grace so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the law, but who are of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all.
[time=1902] Chapter 5, this redemptive story continues to unfold.
[time=1906] Therefore, all of that being said, all of that being true, therefore, having been justified by what?
[time=1914] By faith, we have, what's that say?
[time=1918] You know, I've thought a lot about this concept. I've studied this word a great deal in recent days.
[time=1926] I've given a great deal of consideration to it.
[time=1930] I believe it's, I believe it's one of the sweetest truths.
[time=1934] There's a lot of sweet truths in this study of salvation.
[time=1940] I think it's one of the sweetest truths that there is.
[time=1944] That in relationship with him, you and I are afforded the opportunity.
[time=1950] We are given the opportunity to experience something that's so many of us apart from God.
[time=1956] We were so lacking.
[time=1958] And that is peace.
[time=1960] He gives us peace.
[time=1962] Having been justified by faith, we have, we have peace.
[time=1966] We are finally, we were separated from God. We were at odds.
[time=1970] We were at enmity with God.
[time=1972] We were as distant from him as we could be. And in the reconciling of the two and the relationship that's formed, we are given peace.
[time=1982] And the person of Christ that says it right there.
[time=1986] Through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1990] Look at chapter six, chapter six, verse six, knowing this. What a great reality.
[time=1996] What a great reality.
[time=1998] I know there are times when this reality, in a sense, kind of escapes you and I. But what a great reality. Knowing this, that in relationship with him, that old self was crucified with him in order that our body of sin might be done away with so that we would no longer be what? Slaves to it.
[time=2020] For he who has died.
[time=2024] He who has entered into this life-changing relationship with Christ. The Word of God reminds us this morning, my friends, that that person is freed, freed from sin.
[time=2036] Mainly, as you've heard Mitch say it in the past, as you've heard me say it in recent days, from the power of sin.
[time=2046] In the presence and penalty of sin. In him we have been freed. Now, even though we have been freed, Paul says, even though you and I are no longer slaves to it, there is still the conflict that remains between sin and this redeemed heart.
[time=2064] A conflict that will not go away until the day you and I are in glory with him.
[time=2070] There remains a battle. There remains a fight. Paul describes it in such a powerful way.
[time=2076] In chapter 7 verse 17, so now no longer am I the one doing it.
[time=2080] Paul says, but sin which dwells in me. For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is in my flesh. For the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. For the good I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.
[time=2096] What a battle. What a fight.
[time=2098] What a conflict.
[time=2101] I don't know that this verse will be on the screen, but this again is where God brought me 22 years ago. That night I got saved in September of 1983.
[time=2111] Here's the verse that was preached, wretched man, verse 24.
[time=2115] Wretched man that I am.
[time=2117] Who will set me free from the body of this death? First part of 25, thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=2125] Therefore, verse 1 of chapter 8, so in the end, what's the reality? Well, Paul continues to write, therefore, in relationship with him, therefore there is now no condemnation, none, for those who are in Christ Jesus, for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
[time=2148] How?
[time=2152] Well, it's the work of God in your heart, the work of God.
[time=2156] And then God says, though, it's God who saves, he allows you and I to participate in that.
[time=2162] And look at Romans 10.
[time=2165] That if you confess with your mouth, Romans 10 and 9, what a great few verses. That if you confess with your mouth, Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart, that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[time=2175] For with the heart, a person believes, resulting in righteousness.
[time=2179] And with the mouth, he confesses resulting in salvation.
[time=2183] For the Scripture says, whoever believes, there's that deep internal sense of surrender, the giving of one's entire heart and soul and life believing deeply whoever believes in him will not be disappointed for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, no distinction, right?
[time=2202] No distinction between Jew and Greek, no distinction between red, yellow, black or white, no distinction between blue color, white color, no distinction between educated or uneducated, no distinction whatsoever.
[time=2218] Between young, old, middle-aged, the ground at the foot of the cross is what?
[time=2224] Level.
[time=2226] [AMEN] Israel, even.
[time=2230] Chapter 11.
[time=2231] Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't forget.
[time=2233] There's no, I didn't finish.
[time=2234] There's no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all.
[time=2240] But the same Lord is Lord of all.
[time=2242] [AMEN] Abounding and riches for all who call on him, for whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[time=2250] Even Israel.
[time=2251] God's precious people there.
[time=2253] You can read about that in Chapter 11.
[time=2255] Even Israel can call upon the name of Messiah.
[time=2258] Even Israel can accept the truth of who he was and what he came to.
[time=2263] And then we come to Chapter 12.
[time=2266] So having seen all of that, having traveled that road, now Paul in a sense kind of looks you and I and the I is now.
[time=2276] Now, let's live transformed lives.
[time=2283] Let's not be conformed.
[time=2285] Let's be transformed.
[time=2287] And we began last week on the personal front, verses 9 through verse 21, a very practical, very kind of every day look at what you and I living transformed lives would look like.
[time=2298] 9 to 21, we started last week.
[time=2300] We said there are kind of four sections to this passage.
[time=2304] And in the first section, which we looked at last week, verse 9, these are truths in verse 9 related to your personal life.
[time=2312] If you missed last Sunday, I'd encourage you.
[time=2315] Get a CD today.
[time=2316] Order a DVD.
[time=2317] Go online.
[time=2318] Listen to it.
[time=2319] As you do, make sure you kind of catch up with us, if you will.
[time=2323] On the personal front, there were three very important things that you and I as we live out, this life transformation.
[time=2331] He says love sincerely, hate what is evil, cling to what is good.
[time=2336] And now we come to the second section.
[time=2339] He moves from the personal front to the way you and I are to live in community with others, in the family of God.
[time=2346] He talks about now transformed in biblical community with others.
[time=2350] This is how we are to think.
[time=2352] This is how we are to choose.
[time=2354] This is how we are to relate in the family of God.
[time=2357] Wherever the family of God is gathered, wherever the family of God may be.
[time=2361] And it may be three of you or it may be two thousand of you.
[time=2365] Wherever you are in relationship with other believers, if you're going to live in a transformed way, there are some very specific things he calls you and I to keep in mind.
[time=2376] In honor of God's Word this morning, would you stand with me and allow me to read to you Romans 12 verses 10 to 13.
[time=2385] He begins like this, be devoted.
[time=2388] Be devoted to one another and brotherly love.
[time=2392] Give preference to one another in honor, not lagging behind indulgence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, and devoted to prayer, contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.
[time=2413] Pray with me.
[time=2414] Would you, Father, God, as we come to this passage, our prayer is what it always is, Father, we desperately need to understand this truth.
[time=2426] Father, we desperately need this truth.
[time=2429] In our own hearts and lives in God, we need to be able to understand what it says so that we can apply it in the every day.
[time=2437] We desire God this morning that as we come before you, that you would take these words on a page and we know they are so much more than that.
[time=2446] We pray that you would take this great life-changing truth and insert it into whatever part of our life it's needed.
[time=2454] Father, God, as a family, as individuals standing humbly before you, we pray and hope that you will do that.
[time=2461] We open ourselves to that kind of activity.
[time=2464] Grow us and teach us, we pray.
[time=2466] In your son's name, amen.
[time=2469] Well, here we go.
[time=2471] Get out your pen.
[time=2472] Maybe write a few things down here as we look at transformed living in biblical community with others.
[time=2478] Number one, I want you to take note of this.
[time=2480] It says be devoted.
[time=2481] You see it there in verse 10.
[time=2483] Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.
[time=2490] And I want to just start by telling you that this word devoted, and with the Greek, understand, with the Greek, my commitment to you remains what it's always been.
[time=2499] We won't talk about the Greek and we won't get into the Greek unless I feel as if you understanding some basics about the Greek in that context would be helpful.
[time=2508] And I believe this morning, again, it would be very helpful for you to understand this word devoted.
[time=2513] When you look up this word devoted and when you study it, you realize it's really an amazing concept.
[time=2519] He takes two words and brings them together to form this Greek word where it says be devoted to each other.
[time=2527] If we are going to be my friends devoted, number one, it means that we will experience friendship love.
[time=2535] The word devoted in the Greek is made up of two words.
[time=2539] The first word is the Greek word that carries with it the idea of friendship love.
[time=2545] I am so thankful that Marshall was here this morning.
[time=2549] Marshall is my friend.
[time=2551] And I can look around this room and I can spot all kinds of friends.
[time=2556] And most of you who are my friends, I mean you know how I feel about you.
[time=2561] Marshall was here, Marshall and I God's giving us a relationship.
[time=2563] We're growing that relationship.
[time=2565] I love Marshall.
[time=2566] There is a friendship there that's budding and I am so thankful for that and that is deep and that is rich and that is true and that's good.
[time=2574] I love friendship love.
[time=2576] It's to be present.
[time=2578] Interesting thing, the word devoted while it's a conjunction.
[time=2582] The first one means friendship love.
[time=2585] The second word that's brought in there is the Greek word that means family.
[time=2591] Love.
[time=2593] And I love, I love each and every one of you.
[time=2597] I'm so thankful for the friendships that God's given me.
[time=2600] There are some very dear friends in me.
[time=2604] I don't love any of you as much as I love this crew down here and a couple others that are missing, wreaking havoc in the nursery as we speak.
[time=2617] See, that's my family and I love them.
[time=2621] I love them deeply and they're not perfect, but they're my family and I would do anything for them.
[time=2631] And that's that word.
[time=2633] He doesn't go one way or the other.
[time=2635] No, see, it's so important that he brings the two together and he says there's this friendship love and there's this family love and I'm bringing those together to create this unbelievable, special and so incredibly unique kind of love that you all are to have for each other.
[time=2653] Be devoted to each other.
[time=2658] In brotherly love.
[time=2662] The difficult relationships, the easy relationships, the ones you're just getting to know and the ones you've shared life with for years, your posture and your words and your facial expressions and your notes and your phone calls and your hallway conversations, all of it is to express and evidence the sense of I love you deeply because we are part of the family.
[time=2686] And it says at the end of that verse, it says there in verse 10 be devoted to one another in brotherly love, that word there brotherly, that brotherly love is that it's not a gape.
[time=2698] It's not eros.
[time=2700] It's Philadelphia.
[time=2702] It's that tender affection which is why, you know, every once in a while, a good decent hug in the bad idea.
[time=2712] It's why a pat on the back.
[time=2714] It's why a hand that's shook.
[time=2716] It's why it's why it's so good to be together and to express and to communicate that tender affection.
[time=2724] My friends, it's what distinguishes us. The Bible again and again makes it so very clear that the presence of that kind of spirit in this place in our relationships in the living rooms as we meet and gather as small communities wherever we are, there is to be this growing sense of I love you and I'm not going to let go of you, please don't ever let go of me. And when you and I live in relationship like that regardless of what we may have to face or work through, when we live that way, see my friends in today's culture especially, that's not what people do because today people don't care about people, they care about themselves.
[time=2764] And when they bump into a community of people whose love for each other is so deep and so consistent and so faithful mixing this friendship love and this family love, it's what makes you so unique.
[time=2780] It's what God wanted when he said he wanted a people who would in the way they loved him and in the way they loved each other would distinguish themselves from the other nations.
[time=2794] And now he gives you and I the privilege of doing that.
[time=2798] He is a part of the world.
[time=3436] Give me the wherewithal to remember what we talked about Sunday.
[time=3439] Allow me this week to be a follower of Christ who, in a redeemed, transformed way, begins to again and again give preference to others.
[time=3449] And it's like the love thing, my friends.
[time=3452] You weren't designed by God to be loved by your spouse.
[time=3457] You weren't designed by God to be loved fully by another.
[time=3461] You were designed by God to be fully loved by God.
[time=3466] And your needs are needs that fundamentally can be met in a powerful way by Him.
[time=3474] Yes, I realize practically needs can be met.
[time=3478] But understand, you let go of that stuff.
[time=3481] You become one who gives preference and you allow God to meet you in those places where you need to meet Him.
[time=3488] And you will be amazed.
[time=3490] I promise you that.
[time=3492] Well, we'll just jump right back in next week.
[time=3494] We'll pick it up right here, transform living.
[time=3496] Romans 12, 9 to 21.
[time=3498] Would you stand and let me pray for us this morning?
[time=3503] Don't forget tonight, six o'clock, baptism and communion.
[time=3507] What a special time.
[time=3508] And I really hope that you'll make the effort to be back tonight.
[time=3511] Father God, we thank you for this time.
[time=3513] And we thank you, God, for this truth today.
[time=3516] May this truth just permeate our hearts and minds as we leave this place.
[time=3521] May we read it again and again and again this week.
[time=3524] May we talk about it with our friends.
[time=3526] God again, most importantly, with your help.
[time=3528] May we apply it to our lives.
[time=3546] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
