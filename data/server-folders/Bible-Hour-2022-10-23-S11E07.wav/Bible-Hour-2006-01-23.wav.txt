[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=54] and on earth; therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of
[time=66] the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=77] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and, lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=88] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=94] For you breathe in the breath as you gave us to breathe, to worship you, to worship you,
[time=115] and we are singing these songs with the very same back to worship you, to worship you,
[time=129] could we be filled with the ocean filled and with a sky, but much would rain.
[time=142] For every song of earth a queen, and every man, a scribe I pray, to write the law of
[time=162] the Lord, would train the ocean dry, one with the song, planting the home, the strength
[time=182] of the sea, and the strength of the sea, and the strength of the sea, and the strength of the
[time=587] and John 13, 34-35 says, "A new command I give you love one another, as I have loved you,
[time=595] so you must love one another, by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another."
[time=601] We are one in the spirit, we are one in the Lord.
[time=630] We are one in the Lord, and we pray that all unity will one day be restored.
[time=660] We are Christians, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, we are Christians, I am the Lord.
[time=708] God, all my precious and and all praise to the spirit that makes us all right.
[time=730] We are Christians, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord,
[time=751] I am the Lord, we are Christians, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord,
[time=804] we are Christians, we are Christians, we are Christians, we are Christians, we are Christians,
[time=817] we are Christians, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord,
[time=843] [MUSIC - 68 seconds]
[time=918] [APPLAUSE]
[time=929] I got a lot on my heart this morning.
[time=931] I just want to tell you that.
[time=933] And I'm going to try my best to get through it all.
[time=935] Romans 12 is on my heart this morning, but there's just a few other things on my heart as well.
[time=941] And I would just ask you to, as you always do, kind of bear with me, and allow me to do my very best to communicate to you some things this morning that I feel like I need to, some things that are important, I think, for you and for me and for this family and for what God has us doing.
[time=962] The first thing, I don't know what to do with this.
[time=967] I don't know where I'm going personally, just in my own response to this.
[time=975] Part of me thought I should just think it through a little bit more before I said anything to you.
[time=983] But I think maybe then the Lord prompted me to just maybe invite you to pray about it with me.
[time=988] As I share this with you, you'll realize that, you know,
[time=994] we see things like this every day.
[time=999] This may be a little extreme, but nonetheless, you and I know that we live in a fallen, very challenged world.
[time=1008] You and I know, those of us that know the Lord, those of us that have a growing understanding of what's true, those of us in this room who have an understanding of what God designed when He designed this world and when He designed you and me.
[time=1023] And so we see things all the time that would be contrary to that design.
[time=1028] And this time it just, I just couldn't let go of it.
[time=1034] And I heard about it, was at a conference, a one day opportunity for me this last Wednesday.
[time=1043] And as I attended this conference just that one day, I heard a man, an expert really in this arena, he referred to this, and now then as I'm flying home yesterday, I yanked this out of the magazine, I bought the magazine, and yanked it out of the magazine, just in case you were wondering.
[time=1062] You know how sometimes, I think this was time, and you know, oftentimes over on the side column, they'll just have a list of numbers, and then the numbers have significance, and then you read through, and so under numbers, I see the number, I see the number 10 million.
[time=1082] 10 million.
[time=1086] The estimated number of female fetuses, aborted in India,
[time=1093] over the past 20 years, by parents hoping for sons.
[time=1109] And most of you would know that because of the social pressures, and in some cases because of the religious system, there are millions and millions of parents who feel as if they should have boys,
[time=1124] and that runs so deep, and that is so entrenched, that in India over the last 20 years, they've killed 10 million.
[time=1136] Probably shouldn't let that number go past it too quickly.
[time=1140] 10 million little girls who weren't wanted, and who weren't given a choice, they were just killed, cut off.
[time=1157] This past Wednesday, as I heard a gentleman speak to this issue, you come to find out that when you throw in China, which is much bigger than India, when you throw in the other surrounding countries and regions, many of whom share either those religious convictions or have that social pressure.
[time=1178] After extensive research, the experts today are saying that on the planet Earth today, there are currently in light of these things, and I hope I say this right, I believe this is the terminology he used.
[time=1190] There are anywhere from 75 to 100 million missing females.
[time=1199] At this point, 20 years later, if all had gone the way it should have gone,
[time=1205] we would have anywhere from 75 to 100 million women
[time=1211] on the planet that we don't have today, because they've been murdered as babies in the last 20 years.
[time=1226] And like I said to you, I don't quite know what to do.
[time=1229] I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[time=1231] I don't know if I'm just supposed to pray about that and ask God to continue to work in the hearts and lives of those in India and China.
[time=1241] I don't know if I should do something.
[time=1244] I don't know if we collectively should do something.
[time=1247] I don't know if maybe we should ask around and see if there aren't places that are doing something, but for some reason, just in the flow of my life and my heart,
[time=1257] I saw that and I couldn't let it go.
[time=1261] So I guess I'm just asking you to maybe pray about that with me.
[time=1266] And maybe we could together think through, if there is something that God has for us there, maybe he would show us that in some way, shape or form.
[time=1282] The other thing, I want another thing, a few more here, bear with me.
[time=1286] The other thing I want to say to you this morning is I want to say thank you.
[time=1290] I want to say thank you too, to you as a family.
[time=1296] It may seem like it to you, it may not.
[time=1299] Maybe it seems shorter, maybe I've worn you out and it seems longer, but it was ten years ago today that a younger couple,
[time=1311] with a three-year-old boy and a three-month-old little girl, came from sunny, swarm, comfortable, golf in January, California.
[time=1330] And it was ten years ago today that my wife and I moved to Indiana.
[time=1338] We landed in Fort Wayne and began that day ten years ago, what has been an amazing journey for us.
[time=1347] There are so many things that I would want to just tell you today.
[time=1351] After ten years, the list would be long and it would take a lengthy amount of time,
[time=1358] so I figured I'd just boil it down to a couple things.
[time=1361] One of them is this, some of you who know me well, and I've shared my story, you know, with most of you.
[time=1368] Most of you know that I moved around a lot as a kid.
[time=1371] My dad was in the ministry and I lived in eighteen different houses, homes, by the time I was seventeen.
[time=1376] I think that entailed maybe sixteen different cities, four different states.
[time=1382] I never had a home.
[time=1387] I never had a home, you know, I had a place to sleep.
[time=1391] I had a mom and dad there for a while, but I never had a home.
[time=1398] Never had a place, never had a people, never had a community that really felt like home.
[time=1405] And over these ten years, you know, those of you who have been here, those ten, those of you who have been here, you know, five, four, three, two, one, doesn't matter.
[time=1415] You all have graciously and very lovingly provided that for me.
[time=1419] And you've provided that for my wife and for my family.
[time=1422] You have been so kind and you have been so supportive and you've been so good to us.
[time=1427] Many of you have helped us raise our, our helping us raise our kids.
[time=1431] So many in the room have done things to just extend kindness.
[time=1436] You've been thoughtful and I just want you to know how grateful we are for these ten years.
[time=1442] I have tried to lead lovingly and well.
[time=1448] I have failed often and I've succeeded by God's grace a few times.
[time=1455] And you all have been very understanding in that journey and so just know how grateful I am.
[time=1461] And thank you for those years.
[time=1462] Our hope is that he'd give us a bunch more and that we could share in them together.
[time=1467] So thank you very much for all you've meant to us.
[time=1470] [ Applause ]
[time=1483] >> Another thing I wanted, two more things.
[time=1486] And one of them is, and this isn't meant to be, this isn't meant to be sarcastic or funny.
[time=1492] I just couldn't help but see the parallel.
[time=1494] Many of you may have seen it as well.
[time=1496] But I felt like we needed to just maybe at least say something briefly about it.
[time=1501] And I want to just talk to you about the Colts.
[time=1506] I see the Steelers shirt in the back.
[time=1515] I want to just talk to you just for a minute about the Colts.
[time=1518] And for those of you who are Colts fans, it was a tragic day, I know.
[time=1524] But, and I've heard this, you know, you begin to hear about this the very next day.
[time=1529] Many of you have had the conversation.
[time=1531] It's not new news.
[time=1532] I just want to make sure we all have a chance to at least just catch the gist of this.
[time=1537] It was amazing to me watching the game, how in watching the Colts after resting the starters for three weeks,
[time=1548] after not playing, after not being in the game for three weeks.
[time=1555] And then they got the extra week because they had acquired the bi-week because of their records.
[time=1561] So now having not played for a month, having not engaged in the battle, having not rolled up their sleeves,
[time=1569] having not played for a month, for all intents and purposes, even though there was some drama at the end,
[time=1577] they got their clocks cleaned.
[time=1581] And I just want to remind you, forget the football, that in the spiritual arena, the same is so very true,
[time=1591] that if you and I think for a moment that somehow, because there is a battle, right?
[time=1598] Whether you like it, whether you identify it, whether you realize it, whether you accept it or not, there is every day of fight, right? Every day of battle, raging, huge, stakes much higher than the AFC Championship game.
[time=1612] Every single day there is a battle for your soul, a battle fought by one whose intent is to ruin and destroy you.
[time=1620] And if you and I think for a moment that we can somehow show up for the battle, having not exercised,
[time=1627] having not disciplined ourselves, having not given ourselves to the kind of preparation and engagement needed,
[time=1635] then you and I are mistaken, then we are foolish to think that somehow we can stand up to this evil enemy,
[time=1642] having not played for four weeks.
[time=1646] That's why the Psalmist says each and every morning he lifts his voice.
[time=1650] That's why we've talked about it again and again, an abiding in him, a relationship with him whereby each and every day
[time=1656] maybe once, maybe twice, maybe three times a day, you and I are giving ourselves to time of listening, time of reading, time of worship, time of meditation, time of memorization, time of filling our hearts and souls,
[time=1669] strengthening our lives, keeping our senses and our minds and our hearts sharp,
[time=1677] so that each and every day when you and I go and face the battle, we can stand not in our strength,
[time=1684] but in the strength of what is true and right and good.
[time=1687] And I hope and pray that you are each and every day on a regular basis feeding your heart and soul
[time=1695] and preparing for the fight that you and I face. Amen?
[time=1704] All right, one more thing.
[time=1709] And you know, I don't normally speak to this kind of thing, we normally do our very best to just teach you this
[time=1717] and allow this to speak to whatever it needs to speak to, right?
[time=1721] I think from yesterday I kind of went a little over the, I kind of got pushed a little further than normal,
[time=1727] I kind of went over that line when one of the kids in my own family, just I think just because they had heard enough,
[time=1737] they had seen enough, it's everywhere they go today.
[time=1742] And there was a little one in my home who asked me what the deal was with broke back mountain.
[time=1751] They just, they didn't quite understand what this whole thing was with the two cowboys.
[time=1760] So once I realized, and I think I had realized it earlier than yesterday, but once it hit me like that and I saw what the enemy is doing,
[time=1770] you know, I see what the enemy is doing there.
[time=1774] Any of you who have been around for a while know that it's not a new tact.
[time=1777] The enemy has for years and has for generations been taking that which is dishonoring to God.
[time=1785] The enemy has for years and years and for generations taken that which is contrary to God's design and tried to in a number of different ways bring it into our lives so that we can somehow just kind of grow to a place where we might just accept it.
[time=1801] Just see it as not so bad, kind of become numb to its reality.
[time=1809] And so, you know, it's no surprise he now, the enemy now does it again.
[time=1814] And in this particular instance with this movie that we're hearing so much about and it's all over the papers and it's all over the radio and it's all over the TV
[time=1822] and it's everywhere you listen and look.
[time=1825] You've got these two guys married, married men with wives and kids throwing themselves into a homosexual relationship up in the mountains.
[time=1836] And the way it's portrayed and the way it's viewed, you know, they would want you to see it as beautiful and romantic and really in the end just okay.
[time=1851] And it amazes me as I see this whole thing unfold and as it gets talked about nobody's talking about Narnia anymore.
[time=1860] They didn't even talk about, they didn't talk about Narnia. Narnia blew everything, everybody away. Narnia with this incredible imagery and picture and story of Christ and redemption.
[time=1871] It's brushed to the side. Now all we hear about this, this broke back mountain, I don't know if you've seen the numbers, it's not making any money.
[time=1879] Nobody's going to see it. Nobody most don't want to see it.
[time=1884] And yet it's all you and I hear about it and I just wanted to this morning, I just felt as if and I want you to bear with me because I want to say a few things.
[time=1893] And I hope none of it's surprising to you. I just, I hope as we walk through this just briefly, it would serve for many of you maybe just as a reminder.
[time=1902] I know we've got kids in the room and you know what, I'm glad in a sense because I feel like today either we're going to speak to them.
[time=1909] We're either going to speak truth into their 12, 11, 13 year old hearts and minds, 10 year old hearts and minds or culture will.
[time=1919] And culture will. And so we've got to do our best to lovingly and appropriately with conviction and integrity speak truth into the hearts and lives of our kids and to those that know and love the Lord and try to help us respond to things of this nature in a way that would bring great glory to Him.
[time=1938] Now let me just remind you of a few things. The Activistic homosexual agenda and there is one.
[time=1945] I hope you realize that in the 70s and early 80s, the homosexual agenda was militant.
[time=1953] It was aggressive. It was, it was, it was dirty and it was mean and it was cruel and it was in your face and then they realized that wasn't working.
[time=1963] They realized that that wasn't going to win them any friends in places where they needed friends to see things progressing.
[time=1970] So now in the late 80s, 90s and today it's become softened. It's not militant. It's not mean. It's not aggressive.
[time=1978] They want to do everything they can to desensitize you and convince you that the homosexual lifestyle, they don't talk about the homosexual act.
[time=1986] They talk about the homosexual lifestyle and they want you to see it as normal.
[time=1991] They want you to see it as not an aberration. They want you to see it as safe, not potentially deadly.
[time=1995] They want most importantly to their cause. They want you to see that it's really no different than heterosexuality.
[time=2004] Homosexuality, they say, is about love and dignity and companionship. Homosexuals can be good parents, good spouses, good people.
[time=2011] And they want you to stop viewing it as different or deviant.
[time=2015] And with Brokeback Mountain, it's even portrayed as romantic, heart-wrenching. Beautiful.
[time=2022] What I think we just need to be reminded of today is that in God's design, there couldn't be in God's design for relationship.
[time=2035] In the sexual and personal and companionship arena, in God's design, there couldn't be anything further from the truth.
[time=2044] And I want to just remind you of what it says in Genesis 2. You can turn there if you'd like.
[time=2052] Genesis 2.21, let's start in Genesis 2.21. And I just want to remind you of this, okay?
[time=2062] We're not going to go through the entire morning here. I just want you to see a few things.
[time=2067] I want you to just take note, and I want you to process this in your own heart and mind, and allow you to say what you might need to say, respond in ways that you might need to respond.
[time=2076] It says in Genesis 2.21, "So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept."
[time=2082] And then he, God, took one of his ribs, one of Adam's ribs, and closed up the flesh at that place.
[time=2088] And the Lord God fashioned the rib into a woman, fashioned into a woman the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man, brought the woman to the man.
[time=2100] The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.
[time=2109] And for this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined with his wife, his woman, his wife, and they shall become they, the man and the woman shall become one flesh."
[time=2126] God's design for man and woman, very different, very different, physically different, emotionally different, sexually different, built differently, wired differently.
[time=2142] And yet in their difference, they are designed, meant by God, to come together, man and woman, offering the companionship and compliment only experienced when the two come together in this miraculous union where they become, it says, one flesh.
[time=2159] Man and woman, not man and man, and not woman with woman.
[time=2167] We see in Romans 1, where we were just last week, turn there if you will, you see in Romans 1 where when we deviate from God's design as some do, and when you continue to walk down that deviant road, when you go down a track that moves further and further away from what God intended, and especially in this realm of immorality as described in Romans 1, you see where this leads for verse 26, for this reason God gave them over, Romans 1.
[time=2196] Romans 2, 26, for this reason God gave them over, there comes a time in this journey down the immoral road where God gives them over to degrading passions for their women exchanged the natural function, for that which is, say it, unnatural.
[time=2216] And in the same way also, the men abandoned the what? The natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving for those indecent acts in their own persons that do penalty of their error.
[time=2243] It is dangerous, it is as different from God's design as something could possibly be, and it is as sick, and it is as twisted.
[time=2253] Now listen, it is as sick, and it is as twisted as all, as all sin is.
[time=2264] And I want you to just hold onto that here for a moment this morning, because I wonder if the poster at the theater, I wonder if the ad
[time=2273] on TV, if it were a married woman and a married man having some fling up in the woods, I wonder what we'd be saying.
[time=2288] If immorality were being projected, instead of homosexuality, I wonder if the radio talk shows would be a buzz, I wonder if I'd be standing here, trying to give you direction for your kid's sake and for your sake.
[time=2309] I don't know. I want you to make note of this. Don't forget homosexuality is the result of sin's impact and sin's effect. Satan's lie down deep in the soul of man.
[time=2322] Man in his sinfulness left unchecked. You know this, I know this, we see this all the time.
[time=2327] Man in his sinfulness left unchecked moves further and further and further away from what God designed for living, for love and for relationships.
[time=2338] You see it everywhere, the effects of sin. Emorality, sexual sin, idolatry, the people making gods of their financial gains and their financial pursuits and their material possessions.
[time=2354] You see immorality every day, you see idolatry every day, you see gluttony every day, you see pride, you see gossip, you see hatred, bigotry, homosexuality, all of it.
[time=2367] All of it reminding you and I that when at the core of a person's heart and life, they are broken, cracked, not as God designed, no matter who they are, no matter what the outlet, at the heart and soul of every person who before God lives outside of relationship with God.
[time=2392] They are what Jesus saw in the woman at the well in John 4. We've talked about that, Jesus in that incredible exchange with this woman at the well.
[time=2401] She comes to the well again and he sees, yes, he sees her physical thirst as she comes and tries to draw water, but Jesus being Jesus, he sees into her heart, her soul.
[time=2413] And she knows that the five men she's been with and the one she's sleeping with now isn't her husband see, he looks into her soul, he sees how broken it is and he realizes how thirsty she is.
[time=2431] Spiritually and everybody, my friends, the idolater, the homosexual, the immoral, the glutton, the prideful, everybody's dying of thirst.
[time=2447] And you've got to be very careful how you view this and you've got to be careful how you process this.
[time=2457] And he says to you, don't forget to, we're all sexual centers.
[time=2463] Here we have a, here we have a component of sexual sin.
[time=2469] But most of you in the room realize that Jesus clarified the sexual sin playing field when he says that even if you look at a woman with lust in your heart, you're guilty of what?
[time=2481] Say it, adultery. And gals, I do believe that's a, I think that's a two-way deal there.
[time=2490] Whether you're a woman or a man, I think he's being pretty clear that when you or I look at another lustfully, we are guilty of adultery, of unfaithfulness.
[time=2505] It always amazes me when I hear folks say, well, you know, he's not really being literal there.
[time=2513] They'll say, couldn't be really being literal there because if he's being literal, then that means we're all guilty of adultery.
[time=2524] I think he was being literal and I think we're all guilty of sexual sin at a very serious level.
[time=2536] And I hope you and I will continue to repent of that.
[time=2539] I hope you and I will continue to confess that.
[time=2541] I hope you and I will continue to walk away from that.
[time=2545] But as the movie plays out in the culture, don't forget your own sinful heart
[time=2552] and our own need to continue to go before him.
[time=2555] And the answer to it all, just to remind you, I know you don't need this.
[time=2559] I know you know this, but the answer to it all in the life of the homosexual and the life of the idolater
[time=2566] and the life of the glutton and the, whoever it is, whatever it is, the answer is the grace and mercy of God, amen?
[time=2576] Experienced only when God, when God redeems them, when God saves them from their sin, whatever sin it might be.
[time=2588] And you know and I know that every time we stand in those waters, whether it's here in this room or if it's out the lake,
[time=2595] every chance we get to hear these stories of life change, I know God saves and it's God who redeems, but again and again and again we hear
[time=2604] that he uses people like you.
[time=2607] And he uses, he uses people like me, he uses us who are hopefully willing to extend a hand and a heart
[time=2617] no matter what they might look like, no matter what they might be doing, no matter what they might be engaged in,
[time=2623] it is the family of God who hasn't forgotten what it's like to be on the outside looking in,
[time=2629] who with great hope for redemption and a gratitude for the mercy shown us, extends a hand to whoever we may need to extend a hand to,
[time=2640] hoping and praying that the love of God that we sang about this morning would reach into the heart of this person and make them whole.
[time=2650] So just some things to think about, some things to consider, some things to share with those who you may need to share that with,
[time=2659] and thank you for giving me the chance to do that.
[time=2663] Couple things from Romans 12, what do you say?
[time=2666] Transformed living, I want to finish up kind of where we jumped in last week, we're back at Romans 12.
[time=2674] We find ourselves in what has become a series here, it was just some good devotional reading for me over the break, it's turned into a,
[time=2681] I think, a prompting where I sense God leading us to just take some time as a family and look at this passage, Romans 12, 9 to 21,
[time=2690] and these very explicit, these very clear, these very practical commands that God gives us here that really describe for us and define, if you will,
[time=2701] what it looks like to live, what He talks about in Romans 12, too, transformed living.
[time=2708] We've talked about that, it's when your external expressions, whatever they might be, it's when externally the way you live and choose and value,
[time=2718] it's when externally you are aligned, your external expressions lining up with the internal spiritual reality of your life.
[time=2728] And when you ask, well, what's that look like?
[time=2732] How am I to live out practically this faith, this changed heart and life that God has brought?
[time=2739] Well, we come to this passage right here, and we saw the passage broke down into four categories.
[time=2746] Initially, Paul wanted you and I to consider transformed living at a very personal level,
[time=2752] in the intimacy of your own heart and life, in the very personal arena of your life.
[time=2757] And so he said, under the personal living category, he said, number one, let your love be without three things in verse nine, let love be without hypocrisy.
[time=2765] In other words, love sincerely, hate evil and cling to what is good.
[time=2770] And we talked about that, and if you missed it, get the tape, get the CD, get the DVD and make sure you catch up with us.
[time=2777] We moved from transformed living on the personal front last week to transformed living in biblical community with others.
[time=2786] Here we see Paul take several verses and speak to the way in which your transformed living should be played out in the midst of the relationships here in the family of God that he has given you,
[time=2798] the relationships that he's given me, the one in others of our lives.
[time=2804] Here is what that's to look like. Here are some things where to practice.
[time=2808] And we started there last week, be devoted, it says in verse 10.
[time=2812] Be devoted to one another. In brotherly love, give preference to one another in honor, and that's as far as we got.
[time=2819] Be devoted, that was a very interesting, very helpful word.
[time=2823] That word, if you remember, meant to have a friendship love and a family love, the kind of love I'd have for a best friend and the kind of love I'd have for my wife and kids.
[time=2832] It's those two loves brought together in a very powerful way.
[time=2837] And he says love each other in this family, in this body of Christ, express it and show it and feel it at that level, a devotion to each other.
[time=2849] In brotherly love, brotherly love there. We looked at that word, it meant a tender affection.
[time=2856] I don't just cognitively mentally love you, no, I show it.
[time=2861] I express it with tender affection.
[time=2866] And I am going to, as the verse continued, and as we continued last week, I am going to prefer you over me.
[time=2875] We are going to prefer each other. We are going to put others first, we are going to yield to others' plans or desires.
[time=2883] We are going to choose sensitivity to others, all of it over and above my sensitivity to me.
[time=2893] I'm going to view you, Philippians 2, as more important than myself.
[time=2896] And I am going to, with humility of mind, it says, lower myself to a point of service, to a point where your needs can be met.
[time=2906] And when you prefer each other that way, when you practice that kind of preference, incredible things take place.
[time=2916] Well, we want to move on here this morning. Look at what it says in verse 11, not lagging behind in diligence, not lagging behind in diligence.
[time=2926] You see it there? Fervant in spirit serving the Lord.
[time=2931] Hey, my friends, write this down in your relationships with each other in biblical community. Be diligent.
[time=2939] Be diligent in this community relationship that we share here in the church and all that God has given us to do and be a part of as we follow Christ together.
[time=2949] Paul says, don't lose the diligence. Don't falter. Don't fade in your diligent devotion to each other.
[time=2959] In being devoted and expressing this kind of love, be diligent in the giving preference to one another.
[time=2966] In the no, no, no. You go first, mind said, he says, be diligent.
[time=2971] What does diligent mean? I told you earlier, maybe now you could just write it down.
[time=2975] Doing something with diligence is giving yourself to it with great physical and emotional zeal, with great enthusiasm, with real genuine before God intensity.
[time=2986] It brings physical and emotional efforts together.
[time=2990] An old mentor of mine used to say that whatever is worth doing for the Lord is worth doing with enthusiasm and excellence.
[time=2998] And I agree. I agree. I agree wholeheartedly.
[time=3003] And it bothers me. It bothers me about me. And it bothers me about you.
[time=3008] It bothers me about us when I see us stirred in our hearts and zealous in our commitments.
[time=3017] When I see you or me being enthusiastic about something that doesn't matter, really.
[time=3028] And I'm all right with that as long as it's kept in proper check and balance.
[time=3035] I mean, I went to a conference this week. One day, I played golf the next day and a half.
[time=3042] When I was walking through the indie airport on my way, I was whistling.
[time=3047] I was jumping. I was skipping. I was laughing. I was giggling.
[time=3051] I was so excited that I was going to get to go and go to this conference for day and play golf for a day and a half.
[time=3058] Nothing wrong with that. I was zealous. I was enthusiastic.
[time=3064] You know what? And I'm just trying to give you an example of this and you know me.
[time=3070] I'm not toot my own horn here. I'm just trying to grow with you.
[time=3074] And he's grown me in this. You know what? I had my alarm set for this morning.
[time=3079] I usually get up pretty early. I couldn't sleep this morning. I was up at 4.30.
[time=3085] Wide awake. And I could not wait. I could not wait to be here with you.
[time=3093] I couldn't wait to thank you for 10 years. I couldn't wait to jump back into this passage.
[time=3099] I was whistling and I was skipping and I couldn't wait to be here with you in this place.
[time=3107] And it felt better than the golf.
[time=3112] What are you enthusiastic about? What are you zealous for?
[time=3117] What brings out that extra in you? Let me just tell you about some things in a general sense.
[time=3122] I think in general, my friends, there should be a diligence in you.
[time=3127] In general, diligence, do you prepare your Sunday school lesson for those five-year-olds with diligence, with zeal and enthusiasm?
[time=3138] Because it means so much and mistakes are really that high.
[time=3143] And it's such a privilege that you get to speak that truth into their lives.
[time=3148] And so you give it everything you have. You're not lazy. You don't hold back.
[time=3152] You don't put it off till 10 on Saturday night. Are you diligent in the way you sing and lift your voice in worship?
[time=3160] Are you diligent when you write the check, that sacrificial, regular check you write,
[time=3166] amount of money that you bring to gift back to God?
[time=3170] You do that with enthusiasm and intensity and zeal because it means that much.
[time=3176] Are you diligent in your post at the door as a greeter?
[time=3182] Do you do it with enthusiasm and energy because it's your spiritual service of worship?
[time=3187] Do you serve in the nursery diligently with zeal and excitement and enthusiasm?
[time=3193] Do you model enthusiasm as a mom or dad when it comes to getting up and getting ready to come and worship as a family on Sunday?
[time=3201] How are you doing moms and dads at 705 on Sunday?
[time=3210] With diligence, we find great promise. Look at Hebrew 6, 10 to 12, it will be on the screen.
[time=3217] For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward his name in having ministered and instill ministering to the saints.
[time=3228] In verse 11 it says, "And we desire that each one of you show the same what." Say it.
[time=3233] Diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end.
[time=3238] In verse 12 it says, "So that you will not be sluggish." There's your opposite word.
[time=3243] You're either diligent or you're sluggish and he doesn't want you to be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promise.
[time=3253] General diligence, but don't forget the context of our passage.
[time=3256] The context of this passage here in Romans 12 is not general, it is specifically your relationships.
[time=3262] So I leave you with this, while diligence in general is good and needed, our passage calls specifically for diligence in community.
[time=3272] Enthusiasm and excellence in our devotion to each other and our brotherly love.
[time=3279] Let me ask you, how far will you walk with someone who's in need?
[time=3283] How far will you go with someone who's in the midst of it?
[time=3289] Who's in the midst of crisis? Who's in the midst of confusion? Who's in the midst of pain? Who's in the midst of disappointment?
[time=3295] How far will you go? How far around their shoulder would you put your arm?
[time=3300] To faithfully and diligently, fervent in spirit, walk with them.
[time=3306] He says, "Don't let it fade, don't let it falter, be diligent, zealous and intense in our preferring others."
[time=3313] Somebody told me this week, preference, preferring others.
[time=3317] Somebody married 54 years, told me it was the key to a good marriage.
[time=3323] And I see your heads nodding. Those of you who know what I mean, those of you who have seen more marriage than I,
[time=3329] you know, year after year after year, God is honored when you let go more and more and more so of your own demands and your own agendas.
[time=3339] Zealous and intense, enthusiastic and excellent, fervent in spirit.
[time=3344] And look how it ends there, serving the Lord.
[time=3348] I love how it ends. That's serving the Lord, my friends.
[time=3351] Being devoted and brotherly love, giving preference. Not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit.
[time=3358] That is serving the Lord in relationship with others.
[time=3363] Let me ask you to stand. If you would, we'll jump right back in.
[time=3366] I'm going to ask Bob Purdy. If he would come and close us in a word of prayer this morning, I'd love to greet you out in the foyer. If you make your way out that way, Bob is part of our team.
[time=3376] I'm so thankful for Bob. He has done a great deal as it relates to helping us move toward community here.
[time=3383] He's also a huge help to me personally on the pastoral care front.
[time=3387] Many of you who call many of those in need here when it comes to counseling and those who are facing difficulties,
[time=3393] Bob continues to be a huge encouragement to so many and a real help to me in that.
[time=3398] So Bob, thank you for being here. Close us if you would in a word of prayer.
[time=3406] [SILENCE]
[time=3432] And a lot more. And Lord, this morning, just as we close, even as we pray that, we don't pray that with any arrogance
[time=3442] with any righteousness of our own because that's us.
[time=3448] We stand here before you broken, remembering that it is by your Son Jesus Christ and His stripes
[time=3458] that healing comes. And in that we rejoice. And we've heard too about being zealous and diligent.
[time=3470] And with humble hearts this morning, we simply offer up our great, great need for you, moment by moment.
[time=3480] Lord, the psalmist said, "You have searched me and known me." And in the very same psalm, he ended by saying,
[time=3488] "Lord, search me and know me. Keep on doing it and see if there's anything in me that is displeasing to you."
[time=3499] Out of a hearts cry, "I want to honor you and be in your righteousness Christ." And so with that,
[time=3508] thought and the promise that Paul told us, our confidence is in this, that he who began could work in us
[time=3518] would bring it to completion in the day of Jesus Christ and until that day.
[time=3524] And so in your name we pray. Amen.
