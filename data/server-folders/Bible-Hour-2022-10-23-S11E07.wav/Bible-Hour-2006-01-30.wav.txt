[time=260] Hi, Mitch, and thank you for joining us again this morning.
[time=263] And you're in for a treat as Kelly proceeds on a series Transform Living, which stems from the heart.
[time=270] Transform Living.
[time=272] And he talked about a personal relationship with God on Transform Living, and now he's in a section of the passage of Romans 12 where he's teaching on transform living in community.
[time=282] Transform living in love.
[time=284] And Kelly's going to talk about three things.
[time=286] Three things I invite you to grab a hot chocolate or coffee and sit down and just process them in your own life.
[time=291] And that's rejoicing in hope.
[time=293] Do you really rejoice with the confident assurance of your relationship with God both now and in the future?
[time=301] The second is persevering in hardship.
[time=304] In hardships when tough times come about, can you really persevere or endure through your relationship with God?
[time=312] And then finally, being devoted to prayer, to having your heart being connected with God's.
[time=318] And you know, as I sat there and thought about what Kelly taught, I realized that in and of myself, I can't do any of those three things.
[time=326] Only the living spirit of God in me can.
[time=330] So once again, I must decrease and he must increase.
[time=336] I can't, he can.
[time=338] It's not going to happen by my might, not by my power, but only by his spirit, not an idea, not a principle, but the spirit of the living God.
[time=346] So I invite you now to just process this in your own life.
[time=349] Thank you so much for joining us and remember that we're here every Sunday morning at 9 a.m. and 1045 and on Wednesday nights for a common ground service from 645 to 815 p.m.
[time=359] Thank you very much for joining us.
[time=379] [MUSIC]
[time=405] >> I will not be shaken.
[time=411] >> Salvation, honor, God, he is my mighty God, my refuge.
[time=419] It's asking him all times for people, for us, for us, for us, our students, for God is our refuge.
[time=429] >> Many are they increased, that jumped me, many are they
[time=443] left, rise up, I can see.
[time=448] Many are we who is safe of our soul.
[time=457] There is no love for him, if God, who the God, who the God,
[time=469] are a shield for me.
[time=474] I know we ever live, come high and come home,
[time=485] are a shield for me.
[time=490] I know we ever live, come high and come home.
[time=502] A shield for me, I know we ever live, come high and come home,
[time=532] I know we ever live, come high and come home.
[time=584] are a shield for me.
[time=589] I know we ever live, come high and come home.
[time=614] A shield for me, I know we ever live, come high and come home.
[time=627] I know we ever live, come high and come home.
[time=635] A shield for me, I know we ever live, come high and come home.
[time=645] I know we ever live, come high and come home.
[time=652] A shield for me, I know we ever live, come high and come home.
[time=740] [APPLAUSE]
[time=750] Well, we find ourselves back in this passage that we've been in for a few weeks now.
[time=756] We've entitled this study, "Transformed Living," and I believe today will be part four.
[time=761] If you've got your Bibles open up to Romans chapter 12, we have just had a great time.
[time=767] I know personally, for me, it has been so very rewarding.
[time=771] This was a study that God brought me to over the holiday break.
[time=774] It was just kind of a personal thing for a couple of weeks there, but the more I studied and the more I read and the more he led me to meditate on these truths, the more I realized as January rolled around, and it was time for us to be together.
[time=787] Again, I felt like, you know what, we really need to as a family.
[time=791] Give some thought and look at this passage, Romans 12, 9 to 21.
[time=796] As I've said in recent weeks, 12, 9 to 21 is a passage that really begins
[time=802] to kind of flesh out. It gives you a very practical, very powerful look at what he talks about back in Romans 12, too, and it's in Romans 12, too, where he said, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed."
[time=817] It is the will of God that you and I would be in relationship with him transformed
[time=823] in our lives, transformed in the way that we think, transformed in the way that we choose, transformed in the way that we value things, transformed in the way that we
[time=834] conduct ourselves in this life that he's given us to lead in.
[time=838] So you begin to ask the question, well, what does it mean to live a transformed life, and then you come to chapter 12, verses 9 to 21, and boom, there you have it.
[time=848] This amazing picture, 25 imperatives, 25 exhortations, 25 commands just listed there
[time=857] for us, lovingly and very forth rightly just offered to you and I, transformed living.
[time=863] You want to know what it looks like? Here you go.
[time=866] Romans 12, verses 9 to 21, and so several weeks ago now, we just kind of dove in,
[time=872] and we began to take a look at this passage from what I have heard from so many of you, from what we hear from those that are tuning in on the broadcast, the emails that we're receiving it seems as if this passage has struck a chord in the life and in the hearts
[time=888] of many, and so it is a real privilege to be able to jump back in with you this morning.
[time=893] Let's go back and just can we read through the passage, and you know what?
[time=897] Before I do that, let me say this to you.
[time=900] This week, it happened again.
[time=903] It happens so often, and I am so grateful to God that it happens so often.
[time=911] But this week again, there I was in my office, I have a day, there's a day in my week
[time=917] where I'm able to actually have appointments with folks who just want to talk about whatever it is they might want to talk about, whatever needs they might have, whatever issues may be present, I sometimes wish I could do that more, but there's an afternoon there on Thursdays where I just get to sit and Laurie makes the appointments and we sit down face-to-face, and this week I found myself in the office with a couple who have been around here for about, if my memory serves me right,
[time=947] I think about five years they've been around, and they have called Black on Home.
[time=952] The amazing thing is that when they showed up five years ago and they were gracious and they were so kind in communicating this to me and to our team in essence,
[time=963] personally their lives and their marriage was in just utter shambles.
[time=971] It just wasn't good. Things were not going well.
[time=974] They had wandered so far from what down deep in their hearts they knew to be true,
[time=982] and that wandering had led to all kinds of issues and heartache and discouragement,
[time=989] and they were about at the end of their rope.
[time=992] And they felt like they sensed that maybe they should just give it one more try, and so they literally opened up the yellow pages.
[time=1001] And they kind of, you know, they did the thing.
[time=1005] And there we were. Praise the Lord.
[time=1008] And they got up one Sunday morning and they came and said in that pew, you know, right there where you're sitting, and they haven't left since.
[time=1019] And it was so encouraging, listen, so encouraging to hear them articulate to me,
[time=1027] no prompting, no words in their mouth, they just began to share how the Word of God
[time=1033] and the Spirit of God and the people of God made such a difference in their life.
[time=1040] The very first Sunday and the second Sunday and the third Sunday and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth, and here we are five years later, and they have been encouraged and they have been reached out to.
[time=1051] They have been loved. People have gotten to know them.
[time=1053] They've been kind of on a slow track in terms of more involvement, but for years they set and soaked up what their souls were so missing, and it transformed them. It changed them.
[time=1068] They said in my office last week, beginning, beginning to go down a new road of potential parenting, they're beginning a small group.
[time=1077] They've stepped up and said, "We need people around us." And they've just joined recently a small home community.
[time=1085] She helps in our children's ministries.
[time=1087] He's getting involved in some things that will bring great growth and strength to his life.
[time=1091] I was absolutely amazed all over again.
[time=1094] I'll never get tired of it.
[time=1096] Transformed lives staring me right in the face.
[time=1100] And he allows you and I to be a part of that.
[time=1103] And he describes to you and I, right here in Romans 12, what it looks like when we live it out.
[time=1111] And I hope every one of you in this room, I really do, I hope and pray that those of you that know him today, I hope you sit in this room and I hope you desire.
[time=1119] I hope that you long in your heart to live a life that is transformed.
[time=1124] Remember, aligned.
[time=1126] Transformation to be aligned externally, aligned with the internal reality of your saved, redeemed heart.
[time=1135] And so we look to this passage again.
[time=1137] It's been a while since we've read the whole thing.
[time=1139] So would you in honor of God's word, stand with me this morning and let me read through Romans 12, 9 to 21.
[time=1145] Transformed living.
[time=1147] Let love, Paul says.
[time=1150] Let love be without hypocrisy.
[time=1152] Abhore what is evil, cling to what is good.
[time=1156] Be devoted to one another and brotherly love.
[time=1159] Give preference to one another in honor, not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.
[time=1166] Rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer, contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.
[time=1176] Bless those who persecute you.
[time=1178] Bless and do not curse.
[time=1181] Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep.
[time=1186] Be of the same mind toward one another.
[time=1188] Do not be haughty or proud in mind, but associate with the lowly.
[time=1194] Do not be wise in your own estimation.
[time=1197] Never pay back evil for evil to anyone.
[time=1199] Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
[time=1203] If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
[time=1210] Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it has written vengeance his mind.
[time=1216] "I will repay," says the Lord.
[time=1218] But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[time=1221] And if he is thirsty, give him a drink.
[time=1224] For in doing so you will heap burning coals on his head.
[time=1227] Do not, verse 21, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[time=1233] Let's pray.
[time=1235] Father God, we remember that in the book of Hebrews, it says that your word is as sharp as a two-edged sword,
[time=1247] that it pierces God and it penetrates deep within the body and soul,
[time=1253] reaching into the deepest part of who we are.
[time=1256] And Father God, this morning, our prayer would be that you would reach deep.
[time=1260] With your word and your spirit.
[time=1264] Whatever needs to be cut open, God, whatever needs to be shown, whatever needs to be removed, whatever needs to be revealed, God, we pray that your scripture would do that very thing.
[time=1275] And God, we pray that you would give us a receptive spirit, God, that we would with great humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save our souls, your word says.
[time=1287] And so God, may we do that, thank you for the privilege of receiving it.
[time=1292] God guard my mouth from error and allow this to be a time father where truth is lifted up and where we can, by your grace and with your help, begin to understand more clearly how it is we can live these transformed lives.
[time=1309] Be with us as we endeavor down that road in your son's name.
[time=1312] We pray and they all agreed and said, Amen, you can have a seat.
[time=1317] Let me just remind you that as we came a few weeks ago to the beginning of this passage, we noted that the passage itself, verse 9 all the way down to 21, basically breaks into four sections.
[time=1328] The first section was an opportunity for us to look at what it means to live transformed lives as it relates to your own personal life.
[time=1340] In verse 9 there, we saw three very important things that personally God says you and I must have in order.
[time=1348] Personally, these are things we must practice as it relates to your heart and your soul and the personal arena of your life.
[time=1356] He says, if you want to live a transformed life, love sincerely, you see it there in verse 9.
[time=1361] Love sincerely hate what is evil cling to what is good.
[time=1365] We had a great discussion, had a great time of study as it related to verse 9.
[time=1370] Again, if you missed it, I'd encourage you to go to the website, and pick it up, or get a CD out in the foyer or DVD.
[time=1378] Then we came to verse 10, verses 10 through 13 now represents the second section, if you will, the second component of this 9 to 21 passage.
[time=1390] And in this second section, we see that Paul goes from the personal life to transformed living in biblical community.
[time=1398] Now, in these verses, he begins to speak to us as it relates to the way you and I would interact with, as it relates to the way you and I would communicate with, as it relates to the way you and I would live with each other.
[time=1411] These verses speak to the principles that guide our relationships in the body of Christ, transformed living in biblical community.
[time=1421] And we began there in verse 10, be devoted to one another, and brotherly love, give preference to one another in honor, not lagging behind in diligence with each other, fervent in our spirit for each other, serving the Lord together.
[time=1437] That was our discussion last week.
[time=1439] Now we come this morning to verse 12.
[time=1443] Verse 12, transformed living in biblical community with others.
[time=1447] Paul continues on and we will hear now, look what it says there, rejoice in hope.
[time=1453] Rejoice in hope, verse 12.
[time=1456] Persevering in tribulation devoted to prayer, contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.
[time=1464] First thing you see there in verse 12, as we continue on, it says, "Rejoice, rejoicing in hope." What a powerful concept.
[time=1474] What a very, very important truth you and I have right before us there in that small phrase.
[time=1480] Rejoice in hope when opposition hits, my friends, when trial or difficulty rear their potentially discouraging heads.
[time=1489] Paul says that we are in relationship with each other and the family of God in community with each other.
[time=1495] It says we are to rejoice in hope.
[time=1500] You and I together, those of you and those in your family, those in your circle of friends, those in your small group, those that you love and know, those that you stand with.
[time=1509] He says we are to rejoice in hope.
[time=1512] Transformed living will, in this context, hold on to each other.
[time=1519] You see, in transformed living, we stay close to others.
[time=1522] We remain in proximity to others.
[time=1525] Why do I say that?
[time=1526] Because I know, I don't know about you, I won't speak for you all, speak for me.
[time=1530] Sometimes when I come up against those who are really struggling, sometimes when I come face to face with the tragedies or the difficulties or the issues that all of us face, sometimes you don't quite know what to do.
[time=1544] Sometimes you don't know what to say.
[time=1546] Sometimes you're not quite sure how to in an effective way
[time=1552] somehow help this person or love this person.
[time=1555] Sometimes the challenges of life can be very, very confusing.
[time=1560] And so sometimes we, sometimes we back away.
[time=1565] Sometimes we go the other direction and we leave them alone.
[time=1571] And Paul says, no, no, no, no, rejoice in hope.
[time=1575] See, in the family of God, we stay in proximity.
[time=1578] We look others in the eyes.
[time=1580] We face all that life and a fallen world brings and we maintain the joy of hope.
[time=1588] We rejoice together, always.
[time=1596] You can write that down, Philippians 4-4.
[time=1598] Go ahead, just write that down.
[time=1600] Philippians 4-4, if you keep going back in your New Testament, Ephesians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[time=1608] Maybe you just can turn there, Philippians 4-4.
[time=1611] It says there in Philippians 4-4, it says rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1614] What? Say it out loud.
[time=1617] Hey, question for you.
[time=1618] Next to always in your Bible, is there an asterisk?
[time=1622] We have a little note down at the bottom that gives you the, gives you the circumstances where that wouldn't apply.
[time=1630] Anybody have an asterisk next to your always?
[time=1632] There, no, no, I don't either.
[time=1636] Be reminded of that this morning, my friends.
[time=1638] Rejoice in the Lord. Say it again.
[time=1641] Always.
[time=1644] I think he meant it.
[time=1645] I think God wanted, I think God wanted Paul to write it because look what he says.
[time=1649] Again, in case you missed it in that first sentence, again, I will say, what? Say it.
[time=1654] Rejoice.
[time=1657] I know it's simple and I know it's real short.
[time=1660] We could all memorize it in 10 seconds, right?
[time=1662] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1663] Again, I will say rejoice.
[time=1665] Sometimes the brevity of it kind of allows us to lose its impact.
[time=1669] Don't lose the impact, my friends, of that truth.
[time=1673] Rejoice.
[time=1675] Rejoice, what is rejoice?
[time=1676] Rejoice is when we are, is when we are expressing our joy together.
[time=1682] Rejoicing is when you and I individually or in community.
[time=1686] Express, identify, state, and proclaim our joy.
[time=1692] We rejoice, he says, together.
[time=1695] We deal with today, together.
[time=1699] We look forward to tomorrow, together.
[time=1702] We long for heaven, together.
[time=1707] Rejoice, he says, and you rejoice with others.
[time=1711] Well, what does this mean?
[time=1713] What does this look like?
[time=1715] When transformed Christ followers rejoice in hope, together.
[time=1722] Well, there are just a myriad of examples that I could give you this morning.
[time=1726] There are so many instances of this.
[time=1729] We see it in the Scriptures.
[time=1730] You and I see God allowing us to experience this in the everyday of life.
[time=1736] And I want this morning to just remind you of a few, what it looks like when we rejoice in hope together.
[time=1742] Because, you know, sometimes it looks different.
[time=1744] Sometimes the circumstances that we find ourselves in, it kind of dictates, in a sense, the flavor of our rejoicing in hope.
[time=1752] I can remember about a year ago, almost, almost a year ago, I believe.
[time=1762] There was a, and there is still.
[time=1765] Thank God, a good friend of ours, who had just kind of,
[time=1771] he was just in the initial phases, the initial stage of beginning to fight and battle cancer.
[time=1778] And I'll never forget the afternoon that he and myself and our elders and our staff gathered in my office.
[time=1786] And this was all a bit new, still, at that point.
[time=1791] And there was a great sense of concern, and there was a real sense of confusion.
[time=1796] And those of you who have experienced that, those of you who have lived through that, you know that while there is a desire in your heart to trust and obey, there is also a great sense of, oh, God, please, no, don't do this, don't go down this road.
[time=1810] This was a cancer that, as we listened to the medical reports, it seemed awfully serious.
[time=1816] And so with heavy hearts in a sense, and yet with hope because of his, our friends and those that gathered in that room
[time=1826] because of our belief in the goodness of God and the faithfulness of God and the wisdom of God, we gathered there in my office and we shared stories together and we talked about life and we laid hands on him
[time=1842] as elders and we prayed.
[time=1845] And we begged God that if it would be his will, that he would save him physically.
[time=1852] He was spiritually already saved, redeemed and made new.
[time=1857] But we prayed, God, if it be your will, would you save him?
[time=1859] And if it's not your will, would you prepare us to walk that road together?
[time=1863] And man after man after man in the room just prayed and we wept and we laughed
[time=1870] and we hugged and we prayed and we rejoiced in hope.
[time=1879] I'll never forget the very first time in my Christ-following journey.
[time=1885] I had just come to faith, maybe about ten months, maybe a year.
[time=1890] And I was growing leaps and bounds but you know there were some things I just, I hadn't seen or experienced yet in my new relationship with him.
[time=1898] Maybe some of you in the room can identify with that.
[time=1901] I mean, it's a process and as you go, you experience things and he grows, you throw it.
[time=1906] I hadn't been saved that long and one of the guys that God used to really bring me to faith, a guy were friends to this day, his name's Rod.
[time=1914] And as I got to know Rod and his family, I got to know Rod's sister, Stacey.
[time=1920] She was 14, 15 years old at the time and she had leukemia.
[time=1926] And Stacey had been fighting leukemia for quite some time.
[time=1930] The fight against leukemia and Stacey's growing faith and love for God in the midst of that fight was something that that family and the church family that they were a part of had come to know over the years.
[time=1943] And as I got to know Stacey, I'll never forget my heart just being drawn to her spirit and her amazing sense of maturity and perspective at age 15.
[time=1954] And I'll never forget the night when Rod called and said, "Hey, do you want to come with me?" They were down at the hospital and Stacey's not doing well.
[time=1962] And we went down there and she had slipped into a coma and a day later she passed
[time=1968] on to be with the Lord and I remember just being devastated.
[time=1974] I was just devastated.
[time=1977] It was just so sad to me.
[time=1982] And one day turned into two and we had the memorial service, which it seemed, it was confusing for me.
[time=1990] They seemed too happy to my young growing Christ following heart.
[time=1998] I didn't quite get it, but they seemed so full of joy.
[time=2002] Not in denial, a distinct sense of sadness and loss, but there was just a spirit.
[time=2008] Then we went to their house and that I'll never forget.
[time=2012] There must have been about 200 people there that day.
[time=2015] They overflowed into the backyard, they overflowed into the front yard, they were on the side of the house, they were in the house, they were tables everywhere, there was food and there was music.
[time=2028] And there Rod's mom and dad stood, greeting people, smiling and thanking and crying intermittently.
[time=2035] But there was just as I watched it unfold this enormous sense of joy.
[time=2040] See, because they understood what Paul said when he wrote to the Thessalonians, you may be familiar with this.
[time=2045] He says in 1 Thessalonians 4, 13, as it relates to death, he says, but we don't want you to be uninformed, brethren.
[time=2053] 1 Thessalonians 4, 13, we don't want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, those who have passed, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.
[time=2068] Hope is an amazing thing.
[time=2073] Hope is this assurance that we have of a life with him here today and forever in the days to come.
[time=2081] Hope is this assurance of his grace and mercy and love.
[time=2085] Hope is the realization that there is nothing that can separate us from his love.
[time=2090] Rejoicing together.
[time=2095] We've talked about joy before.
[time=2098] I've given you that definition in the past.
[time=2100] Let me just give it to you one more time.
[time=2101] Joy, this expression of joy together, joy is a deep sense of peace.
[time=2107] Joy isn't giddy happiness.
[time=2109] Joy is a deep internal sense of calm, of peace.
[time=2114] Knowing that a loving heavenly, not a mean, not a brutal heavenly, no, no, a joy is a deep sense of peace.
[time=2122] Knowing that a loving heavenly father is thoughtfully and with purpose, orchestrating the events of our life.
[time=2129] Events designed by a loving God to grow you.
[time=2133] Events designed by a loving God to do what he says in Philippians 1, 6, it says, "He who began a good work and you will complete it.
[time=2140] He will make you more like him.
[time=2143] And he will grow you and he will build you up sometimes through the joys and the blessings of life.
[time=2150] Sometimes he grows us and completes us through life's sorrows and difficulties and trials.
[time=2157] Joy, that deep sense of peace.
[time=2160] We are to rejoice in hope with each other.
[time=2162] It's when you stand or sit with a good friend
[time=2169] who has done the unthinkable.
[time=2172] It's when you stand or sit with a good friend who has experienced the unthinkable being done to them and you extend your hand and your heart and you tell them you're going to walk with them.
[time=2184] No matter how dark it gets, no matter how hard the wind's blow, you remind them that he is God, that mercies are new each and every morning, that strength, strength is available only in him and that you are their friend
[time=2198] and that hope will never let them go.
[time=2200] We rejoice in hope, my friends, when we weep together.
[time=2206] Here's just some, here's just some practical things for you to write down or just to think about on your own mind.
[time=2211] We rejoice in hope when we weep together.
[time=2216] Sometimes, you know what?
[time=2217] Sometimes we just sit together.
[time=2221] Sometimes proximity, just being near you helps.
[time=2231] We rejoice in hope when we pray together.
[time=2240] Several months ago, I was due for a meeting over on this side of the street with Corbin.
[time=2245] I was running a little late because it was one of those days.
[time=2251] I think if memory serves me right, it was maybe one of those weeks.
[time=2255] And because of things I had probably just done personally,
[time=2261] because of some things that were going on in the ministry, difficult decisions that were maybe needing to be made, difficult situations I was finding myself in the midst of.
[time=2271] It was just a myriad of things going on and my heart was heavy.
[time=2275] I knew there were things that he and I needed to discuss.
[time=2277] I actually came down the hall and I heard him playing in here.
[time=2283] What a gift. I get to go to work and walk down halls and hear Corbin playing the piano.
[time=2288] I don't know what your hallways are like, but I came walking down that hallway and Corbin's in here working on something and the lights are down low and there's a few lights on the front and I walked in.
[time=2300] And he said, "Hey, you ready to go?" And I just said, "You know what? I don't think I am." And I just said, "Would you keep playing?" And he kept, just the two of us in here.
[time=2312] And he was playing and I think this was even up here and I think I just laid across this thing and I think I just kind of leaned against it.
[time=2321] And he was beginning to sing and so I began to sing.
[time=2326] Like loudly, you weren't here, so it was easy.
[time=2330] And I just sang.
[time=2335] And then he sang and we sang together.
[time=2338] And I wasn't beginning to envision an album coming out.
[time=2344] It wasn't as if this was something we were working at there.
[time=2347] We were just singing.
[time=2352] And it does something to the soul when you're with those that you love and you pray or you sing or you sit or you read or you listen.
[time=2362] It's just a sweet thing.
[time=2366] We rejoice and hope, my friends.
[time=2368] Look at that verse.
[time=2370] We rejoice in hope when we face all of life together.
[time=2374] Life, death, divorce, failure, heartache, addictions, loneliness, betrayal.
[time=2383] When we face it all, arm in arm.
[time=2385] One not allowing the other to lose heart or lose sight of the goodness of God and the hope that he alone allows.
[time=2394] The verse doesn't say what you and I sometimes are prone to do in the midst of these things.
[time=2400] See, the verse doesn't say that we wallow and complain in bitterness.
[time=2406] I mean, Lord knows we could, right?
[time=2408] We can humanly justify the fact that what we're facing or what's coming down the pipe our way is so unfair.
[time=2417] It seems so divinely insensitive.
[time=2421] But then that begs the question, is he a good God or isn't he?
[time=2425] Is he wiser than you or me or isn't he?
[time=2428] Does he somehow understand this thing in its totality or doesn't he?
[time=2435] No, we don't wallow and complain in bitterness.
[time=2438] No, the Scripture says that you and I are to together rejoice in hope.
[time=2447] Next, he says this, next point as the passage continues to go,
[time=2453] this again, so this point now so very related to what we've just seen.
[time=2457] Look at the text, rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation.
[time=2463] Transformed living, my friends, it perseveres in hardship with each other.
[time=2470] And I want you to remember this, I want you to just kind of see this.
[time=2472] It's blatant, I think, clear for all of us to see this morning.
[time=2476] It's because we can rejoice in hope that we're able to endure tribulation.
[time=2482] The two go hand in hand.
[time=2484] It's because we can rejoice in the hope and the peace that we have in relationship with Christ that we're able to endure hardship, whatever its form or severity.
[time=2496] You see, here's the bottom line, this is how it works.
[time=2499] Just track with me on this, I think most of you will be able to.
[time=2502] You see, because we have absolute assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of our lives,
[time=2513] do you have that?
[time=2516] It's probably just a good moment, right?
[time=2518] They're just to stop and just give you the opportunity to think that through.
[time=2523] See, enduring, persevering through life's difficulty.
[time=2527] See, it is directly tied biblically and spiritually to the fact that in relationship with Christ, you and I have absolute total and complete assurance
[time=2541] as it relates to the ultimate outcome of our lives.
[time=2545] We will spend eternity.
[time=2548] In relationship with Him, we will spend eternity in the loving presence of our King.
[time=2554] We will spend forever in a place that He has prepared, meant for you and I to be with Him and the other saints in a life designed uniquely by Him, in a place designed uniquely by Him for us to worship Him and be with Him and experience Him.
[time=2574] We can persevere through any obstacle and endure any suffering because of that great truth.
[time=2585] It's really one of the most amazing gifts of life in relationship with God.
[time=2590] Don't miss this.
[time=2591] That the obstacles and sufferings of life are not.
[time=2595] They are outside of relationship with Him, but in relationship with Him, they are not deal-breakers.
[time=2602] They are not life-ruiners.
[time=2606] They are not the end of the road.
[time=2609] It is not the calamity of all calamities, no.
[time=2613] They are painful, they are difficult, they stretch us.
[time=2616] Sometimes they are ultimately confusing, but because of what we believe to be true and is true about God, we understand that they grow us and prepare us for a time.
[time=2628] We're having been grown, we will be with Him.
[time=2630] Romans 5, go back a few pages.
[time=2638] Romans 5, not only in verses two to five, not only tells you, shows you, describes for you how we can view the suffering and the hardship,
[time=2649] it shows us the process that God takes us through when you're willing to endure it.
[time=2654] When you're willing to transform living, persevere in hardship.
[time=2659] What a great passage.
[time=2660] It just kind of takes us through the process of what God does with you and what He does with me in the midst of that kind of stuff.
[time=2666] Through, look at verse two, "Through Him, Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand.
[time=2676] And we exalt in hope of the glory of God." And not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations,
[time=2687] exalt to proclaim, exalt to lift up, not to run away from,
[time=2693] exalt to adore, exalt to open our arms and our hearts to.
[time=2699] We exalt in tribulation, what?
[time=2701] Yeah, knowing, not feeling, knowing that tribulation brings about what?
[time=2708] Say it, perseverance.
[time=2711] And perseverance, when you, when you stay the course, verse four, perseverance brings about what?
[time=2717] Say it, proven character.
[time=2719] And proven character brings about what?
[time=2722] Say it, hope.
[time=2724] Does hope disappoint?
[time=2728] There's a real question, go ahead.
[time=2730] Does hope disappoint?
[time=2732] No.
[time=2734] No, there may be days when maybe you'd toy with that answer a bit, but I think you that know Him know, as I know, down deep in my heart, no, it doesn't.
[time=2744] Hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[time=2752] This morning, I want to ask you a question.
[time=2755] I want you to look around.
[time=2759] I want you to look around you, literally, this morning or figuratively, in your own mind.
[time=2765] I want you to look around the relational world that God, in His providence and in His sovereignty, has placed you in.
[time=2774] I want you to look around your family and I want you to look around your, your friendships.
[time=2778] I want you to look around the people that are closest to you.
[time=2783] I want you just to take a moment and mentally just go ahead and survey.
[time=2788] The relational context of your life, the co-workers that you're closest to, the neighbors that you've gotten to know, the people under your own roof, whoever it might be.
[time=2798] I just want you this morning before God, in this effort toward transformed living and in light of what we've seen just even so far.
[time=2806] Who is there in your world that really needs you to rejoice with them in hope?
[time=2814] They need a reminder of hope.
[time=2817] They need a new picture of hope.
[time=2820] They need to hear hope articulated again, possibly.
[time=2825] Maybe they don't need it articulated.
[time=2827] Maybe they just need you to model it in proximity.
[time=2831] Who is it in your world that needs you to hold on to them and persevere through some hardship with them?
[time=2838] And I'll let you think about that there, just for a moment.
[time=2844] I'm asking every one of you in this room.
[time=2848] That knows him, that lives in relationship with him and that desires to live a transformed life.
[time=2854] Go give yourself to them.
[time=2858] Go make that appointment, go invite them to coffee, go sit with them today, call them, email them, do whatever it is within your power to do
[time=2868] to be one who would come along and rejoice in hope.
[time=2874] Be somebody who would be willing to come along and persevere through hardship.
[time=2880] And look as the passage continues.
[time=2883] Again, just look at the connection between what we're seeing right now in our next point.
[time=2889] Let me give you one more here this morning, very, very related to rejoicing in hope, very connected to persevering in hardship.
[time=2899] Look at verse 12.
[time=2901] Rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation.
[time=2904] Devoted, see what it says there?
[time=2907] Devoted to prayer.
[time=2910] You know, what's interesting to me is I looked at this and as I thought about this,
[time=2917] as our passage breaks down, remember the first section of the passage, verse 9, that was all about our personal life,
[time=2927] our heart and our soul and our mind before God.
[time=2930] And it's interesting to me, I mean, hear me.
[time=2934] Obviously, prayer is something that God's word speaks to in many, many, many places.
[time=2939] And obviously, yes, it's very personal and should be.
[time=2943] But it was just interesting to me that it wasn't in that first section.
[time=2947] And that now that we come to this section, 10 through 13, that's about the kind of relationship you and I are to have, the kind of relationship we're to experience in biblical community here, here is where we find it.
[time=2960] And it kind of makes sense.
[time=2962] Go back to verse 10.
[time=2963] Because if I'm going to be or you're going to be devoted to me in brotherly love, if I'm going to give preference to you with honor, if you're going to not lag behind in diligence, if you're going to stay zealous toward our relationship, if you're or I'm going to be fervent in our spirit with each other, serving the Lord together, if there is going to be a transformed living commitment for you and I to no matter what we face, rejoice in hope together.
[time=2993] And if I'm going to raise my hand and walk your way, and if you're going to raise your hand and walk my way and endure with me, whatever it is I may have to endure, then you know what? It makes sense that we might pray together.
[time=3006] That makes sense that we might get in our knees together.
[time=3009] It makes sense that I might hold on to you or you might hold on to me and we might offer all of this to him.
[time=3017] The word there is interesting, devoted to prayer.
[time=3022] Back at the beginning of 10 to 13 where it said be devoted to one another in brotherly love, I explained to you that word in the Greek was a word that meant family love and friendship, love.
[time=3035] A devotion to love in that sense.
[time=3038] Different rendering here, different word here, where it says be devoted to prayer.
[time=3042] The word that's used is pras kar tareo.
[time=3046] Don't worry about it.
[time=3048] Pras kar, it's a bunch of things brought together in one word.
[time=3053] Pras kar tareo.
[time=3057] To be, listen, to be strong.
[time=3061] To be strong toward something.
[time=3066] To be passionate towards something.
[time=3070] It is a huge, rarely compromised commitment.
[time=3078] This pras kar tareo.
[time=3081] I am devoted to you in prayer.
[time=3086] I am devoting myself to prayer.
[time=3088] Pras kar tareo.
[time=3089] See, the fact of the matter is that some in the room this morning, myself included, we are pras kar tareo'd
[time=3099] to a clean house.
[time=3103] We are pras kar tareo'd to basketball or football or to NASCAR or to not me personally, but others are.
[time=3113] To sports, some of us in the room are pras kar tareo'd.
[time=3118] Strongly toward the office.
[time=3123] Some have this huge, rarely compromised commitment to more toys or bigger acquisitions while those in your family or those in your small community really need you to pray with them a lot.
[time=3139] They really need you to sit down and listen and engage.
[time=3145] Pray, speak to the Father together.
[time=3148] Call upon the Father together.
[time=3151] Adore the Father together.
[time=3153] Five-year-olds and six-year-olds and seven-year-olds needed.
[time=3157] Teenagers need it desperately.
[time=3159] Your wife needs it.
[time=3162] Your good friends would benefit greatly from a willingness and a readiness on your part to in this biblical community, this relationship that we share to pray.
[time=3175] And I hope that you, I hope that you will.
[time=3178] I hope this morning, if nothing else, that you would leave this place with a sense of who it is around you.
[time=3184] And I hope that with that sense, there would be a growing willingness to live a transformed life, to rejoice with them and hope, to persevere, to roll up your sleeves with them in whatever hardship they may be facing, and to, at all times, be willing to sit with them and kneel with them and pray.
[time=3207] He goes on, and we will next week, contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality, and then that kind of concludes this section.
[time=3217] On transformed living in biblical community, then we'll go on to verses 14 to 21.
[time=3222] Corbin, would you come up, if you would, please?
[time=3224] And just, I'm going to ask Mitch to come up as well.
[time=3228] They're not going to sing, don't worry.
[time=3231] Corbin, would you come up and play?
[time=3232] And I just want to ask all of you if you'd stand.
[time=3238] Corbin led you in a chorus just before I came up this morning.
[time=3242] And I think it's a chorus that's worthy of repeating.
[time=3245] And I just want you to, as he plays and as he leads you in this song, if you know the words, just sing it out.
[time=3251] If you need to look at the screens, that's fine.
[time=3252] But I think more than anything, you know what?
[time=3254] If you're here this morning and you need some help, if you're here this morning and you really could use somebody to rejoice in hope with you, if you need some perseverance
[time=3266] alongside of you, you need somebody to pray for you.
[time=3269] I know it's a big setting, but I'm just going to ask Mitch if he'd do that for you.
[time=3273] And with your heads bowed, you know, and your eyes closed, as Corbin leads us in this song.
[time=3277] And as he concludes it, when he gets done there, Mitch is just going to close us in a word of prayer.
[time=3282] I'll be out in the foyer, I'd love to say hi to you this morning.
[time=3285] But just take a moment and ask God for the strength, allow him to be the shelter in strong tower, that only he can be and allow Mitch to pray for you as we go.
[time=3296] [MUSIC - 89 seconds]
[time=3395] And now, God, by the power of your Holy Spirit,
[time=3407] may we rejoice in hope.
[time=3410] May we experience in our hearts that inner peace that only comes from you
[time=3417] and hope the confident assurance of an abundant and an eternal life with you.
[time=3424] And God, for any single person here who is struggling with hardships right now, oh, God, by the power of your Holy Spirit and not by their own might, not by their own power, but only by your Holy Spirit, what each person here is enduring a hardship.
[time=3437] God, would they be able to do so only, only by persevering through you?
[time=3443] God, bring other people around them in community
[time=3449] to help them endure and to divide the burden.
[time=3456] And God, this week, maybe it's with people in our house, in our homes, maybe it's with people in this church, in this congregation.
[time=3463] God, maybe it's with people at work, maybe it's with someone.
[time=3466] We have no idea that's coming our way this week, but God help us to be devoted to prayer, to bring a third party into the conversation, and to God with whoever we encounter to be open, to having a conversation with them that includes you.
[time=3486] God help us to be strong and steadfast to the most powerful thing we can experience on this side.
[time=3495] Our hearts connected with Yours.
[time=3498] And God, we pray that each of us will experience transform living, a changed, a newly shaped heart and life that only comes from the fingerprints of Your hands.
[time=3514] We love You and Your praise, You've got.
[time=3516] And all God's people agreed and said, "Amen." Have a good day.
[time=3549] (upbeat music)
