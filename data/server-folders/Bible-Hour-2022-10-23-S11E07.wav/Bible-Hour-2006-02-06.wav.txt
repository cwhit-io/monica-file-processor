[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=49] and on earth."
[time=56] Before go and make disciples of all of them, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=71] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to
[time=77] the end of the age.
[time=82] Helping seekers, find and follow Christ.
[time=112] I lift it up in all the earth as to you are.

[time=783] Lord, I pray that your spirit would speak to our souls and our hearts this day.
[time=787] I pray that the words that are preached out of the Book of Romans would come alive and God that we would be obedient immediately to the things that you call us to do.
[time=797] God, I pray for Stephen, I pray for Mitch, I pray that they would decrease and that you would increase through the words that are spoken. Amen.
[time=811] I don't know about you, but what happens to me when I get to participate in this? What we just did when it's all about us decreasing and him increasing, when it's all about the reality of what he's done for us?
[time=826] I don't know about you, but that causes me to sit there and go, wow, what do you want me to do? I will do anything for you.
[time=834] I can't do anything to earn what we're just saying about, but man, can I do something to respond to what we're just saying about?
[time=843] And I just beg him all the time, please reveal, please open the doors, please do whatever you want to do that I can help build your kingdom in a bigger way.
[time=852] I don't care what it is, because that's true, what we're just saying, that's true, and we get to do that here.
[time=860] And we have a guest with us today, he's not a guest, his parents are kind of guests now.
[time=866] John has been in country A, or was it B, country A for a long time serving Wickliffe translators, we sent him out.
[time=875] Paul and us, we kind of join in sending John out. John graduated from the school here, John Eppley, his parents are here.
[time=882] He's ready to go to a new country now, he's going to go in March, he's going to go back to Southeast Asia, where he can, he can, he does surveys, what's the word I'm looking for, John?
[time=892] What? He does language surveys in order to make it possible for Wickliffe people to know what to translate when they go in there.
[time=901] Where the needs are, he discovers where the needs are, and what the population is of the need, and if that's the place they ought to be going.
[time=906] And he's been doing that for a long time, and his parents are here to you guys stand up with John and pray for him.
[time=911] Lord, I want to pray for John, go ahead and clap.
[time=921] Lord, what a privilege we have to participate in the Bible being translated in Southeast Asia now through our son, your son, your servant John.
[time=934] And I pray your protection and your blessing, and I pray that his work will be fruitful there and that people will come to Christ because they read the word translated into their language.
[time=945] I thank you for Mom and Dad that have been faithful to train him up in your nurture and your admonition. Please bless them.
[time=952] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen. What's it feel like for you? Good to have disciples. Feels really good. That is really cool.
[time=961] Yeah, I don't know what grade you started here. How old were you? Kindergarten? Eight. I was right on the money.
[time=968] Seems like he was here forever. The other day when I met with him I said, how old are you now?
[time=977] Have you been out of school like seven, eight years, and it was how many? Twelve or thirteen. Yeah, okay.
[time=984] Well, on my way in, I want to say something too. On my way in, I was realizing how few of the opportunities are to communicate something like this, and I just wanted to communicate it in front of you.
[time=993] I was thinking about how much Steve Longbreak has ministered to me, how much you have ministered to me, what your friendship has meant to me, and there are ways and words that I can't describe.
[time=1004] I came here, thought I was going to have a relationship with Kelly, and I got that, but I got a relationship with you, and I just wanted to thank you for that, and I'd like you to help me thank him for that because he helps so many people.
[time=1019] I really appreciate that, but I also, and every time you get applause on Earth, that diminishes what you're going to get there. He said, if you receive your award here, okay, so don't do that anymore.
[time=1028] You're on a roll. Oh my goodness. Well, we're in Kelly's series on Transform Living, part five, and we're in Romans 12, and really the context of what we're in is about community or love.
[time=1045] The first line of the paragraph is about love, a gape self sacrificial love, and I just want to ask you today, you know, how are you doing when it comes to loving?
[time=1054] You know, how do you love? And I really think that our perspective of what today's message is about love, shares, and cares flows from our perspective of God, and to illustrate that I want to share with you a story.
[time=1066] When I was nine years old, I had this drawer in my dresser where I kept all the cash that I had, and then there was a little savings book, and I didn't really want to do anything with the money.
[time=1079] I just literally wanted to save the money. I wanted to see the stack of cash get taller, or the number get larger in the savings account, and it was really kind of cool because my mom would take money out of it.
[time=1090] And I realized she treated as a petty cash fund, and it still makes me master got issues this day over that.
[time=1098] So she would take it out, but I would know, I paid so close attention that I would know when it would be taken out, and then I would ask her to pay exorbitant interest.
[time=1109] And so it didn't bother me as long as the stack got larger. Well, one day, I was in this discussion with my dad about how big of an eater he was, and how he probably needed to lose weight.
[time=1122] And his response back to me was he could do it at any time. In fact, he could lose 20 pounds in two weeks, any time that he wanted to.
[time=1130] And so this little switch flips in my brain, so light bulb goes off and I think, here's an opportunity to make some money, and add to the cash of my drawer.
[time=1140] And I said, Dad, I bet you $20 that you can't lose 20 pounds in two weeks. You're on! So he has my dad.
[time=1152] So we had the weigh-in, okay? We put that down him out. And I'm telling you, all I could think about for that next two weeks was that $20 bill, that Andrew Jackson picture being in my stack of money because I didn't have a $20 bill.
[time=1166] And I became the devil.
[time=1169] Dad, let's go eat some steaks. Dad, let's go get some dessert. Dad, let's eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat.
[time=1182] And then the day came two weeks later. And I knew, I already knew I was going to put the $20 bill. I was hoping to be crispy, not old and not worn at all.
[time=1191] And we had the weigh-in. And the scales showed that my dad lost 19 pounds in two weeks.
[time=1204] And you really want to know how he ate whatever he wanted and lost all those pounds, don't you?
[time=1211] It's amazing. First of all, I realized that he was leaning on the bar, all right, of the towel bar. And then I looked at him and I said, Dad, there's just no way possible.
[time=1220] And I realized, well, I look back on this and I realized that this was one of my greatest opportunities to learn how to read people was one of the first ones that's right there.
[time=1229] And I knew something wasn't right. And he looks at me and says, Mitchell, you're surely not going to make me pay for only being one pound off.
[time=1236] A little lesson in salesmanship happened in here too, I think.
[time=1241] And I looked at him and I said, Dad, there's just no way. Something's not right.
[time=1247] And I think the spirit of the living God convicted him of his sin. And these words came out of his mouth.
[time=1256] Mitchell, I'm sorry to say, at the weigh-in, I went to my office and I filled my pockets with about 20 pounds of all the medallions and coins and heavy things in there.
[time=1266] There was in my pants, my jacket, and my shoes.
[time=1271] So he would win no matter what. He's a politician. He's amazing. So, it's a whole nether story.
[time=1277] But you know, our perspective of God determines our perspective of sharing and caring.
[time=1282] And I left that little encounter with Dad and I don't think he paid off with.
[time=1288] He didn't share and he didn't care.
[time=1293] And sometimes we do that with God.
[time=1295] We think that God doesn't share and God doesn't care and therefore I won't.
[time=1302] And our perspective of caring, our perspective of sharing flows from our perspective of God.
[time=1307] And God is love, the Bible says, and that's the context of our passage here today.
[time=1312] And Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 13, 3, that love shares and cares.
[time=1316] And it's not just about sharing and caring, but it flows from a heart of love.
[time=1319] If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.
[time=1326] And the opposite of love really is apathy. Apathy says I'm going to write this down.
[time=1329] I don't share and I don't care.
[time=1331] I don't share and I don't care because life is all about me.
[time=1336] I don't love a self-sacrificial agape love.
[time=1339] Instead, I'm apathetic toward the needs of others and I don't share and I don't care.
[time=1344] And so I even come to church wanting to make church life all about me.
[time=1350] And it might look a little like this.
[time=1354] Imagine a church where every member is passionately, wholeheartedly, and recklessly calling the shots.
[time=1362] I have a busy work week and by the time Sunday rolls around, I'm tired.
[time=1366] So how about a church service that starts when I get there?
[time=1370] And do, when you arrive, we begin.
[time=1374] This guy, he plays by his own rules.
[time=1377] We want to find a church where if he starts screaming, we're not the bad guys.
[time=1381] All right? Come here.
[time=1382] Say no more. If your baby's screaming, you stay seated. The others around you can leave.
[time=1388] You know, financially, Sherry and I don't give a lot to the church, but we'd sure like to know who does.
[time=1393] All right, if you join now, you'll know what every person gives in detail.
[time=1398] When I'm in the church service, can my car get a buff and a wax?
[time=1402] Not just that, but an oil change and a tuna.
[time=1405] How about tickets to the Super Bowl?
[time=1407] That's asking too much.
[time=1408] I'm serious. If I'm going to join, I want tickets to the big game.
[time=1411] All right, you join now and we'll get you there.
[time=1414] I like a pony.
[time=1416] Look in your backyard.
[time=1420] Meet Church, where it's all about you.
[time=1428] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1437] Can do.
[time=1440] Say no more.
[time=1443] Oh shoot.
[time=1446] Oh, I like that clip.
[time=1449] So the question today is, how am I not, how do I not be apathetic?
[time=1453] How do I love?
[time=1455] How do I not make life all about me?
[time=1458] And there are these, I think they're two barriers.
[time=1460] Steve and I talked about this when we came up with this episode.
[time=1462] We looked at this passage.
[time=1463] We want the Bible as to say about it.
[time=1464] And I want you to write it down.
[time=1465] Two barriers to sharing and caring.
[time=1467] And I think I either, one, doubt the resource or two, doubt the need.
[time=1474] Doubting the resource, I think, comes in two phrases.
[time=1477] The first one is, "I earned it." It's a quote that says, "I earned it." The second one is, "I don't believe that God will replenish it." Doubting the resource is, "I earned it." It's mine.
[time=1489] Or I kind of insecure and fearful that, "I don't believe that God will ever replenish it."
[time=1495] And so this is reinforced in the scripture if you want to see it real quick.
[time=1498] I earned it.
[time=1499] Do it around me, 8, 10 through 18.
[time=1500] It's one of my favorite passages in the Bible.
[time=1502] It says a lot about what I experienced in my life.
[time=1504] When you have eaten and are satisfied, God speaking through Moses to the Israelites, going to the Promised Land.
[time=1509] When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord your God for the good land, He has given you.
[time=1514] Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God, failing to observe His commands.
[time=1519] Don't become apathetic toward Him.
[time=1520] His laws and His decrees that I am giving you this day.
[time=1523] Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, and when your herds and flocks go large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied,
[time=1534] then your heart would become proud.
[time=1538] You'll become apathetic toward others.
[time=1540] And you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt out of the land of slavery.
[time=1545] He led you through the Bass and Dreadful Desert, that thirsty and waterless land with its venomous snakes and scorpions.
[time=1551] He brought you water out of hard rock.
[time=1555] He gave you manna to eat in the desert.
[time=1558] Nobody did that but God.
[time=1559] Something your father said never known to humble and to test you, that in the end it might go well with you.
[time=1565] You may say to yourself, when you're satisfied and things have gone really well, I earned it.
[time=1570] It's mine.
[time=1571] My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.
[time=1577] But remember the Lord your God for it is He who gives you the ability to produce wealth.
[time=1582] And so confirms His covenant which He swore to your forefathers as it is to this day.
[time=1586] Don't say I earned it, that's doubting the resource.
[time=1588] And don't say I don't believe that God will replenish it.
[time=1591] Don't be insecure about that.
[time=1592] Here's what David had to say about that after all the resources came in to build the temple.
[time=1597] David said this in 1 Chronicles 29.
[time=1600] David praised the Lord in the presence of the whole assembly saying, "Praise be to you, O Lord God of our Father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting."
[time=1609] Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor.
[time=1613] For everything in heaven and earth is yours.
[time=1616] Yours, O Lord, is the kingdom.
[time=1618] You are exalted head overall.
[time=1621] Wealth and honor come from you.
[time=1623] You are the ruler of all things.
[time=1624] In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.
[time=1630] Now, O God, we give you thanks and praise your glorious name.
[time=1634] But who am I?
[time=1635] This is David's humble heart response.
[time=1637] Who am I?
[time=1638] And who are my people that we should be able to give is generously.
[time=1641] A word we're going to see come up again and again.
[time=1643] As generously as this.
[time=1645] Everything comes from you.
[time=1648] And we have given you only what comes from your hand.
[time=1651] I don't believe that God will replenish it what he does.
[time=1653] It comes from his hand.
[time=1654] That's what doubting the resource looks like.
[time=1656] Happened to me this week.
[time=1657] I got this 2005 annual statement from my bank that showed my total withdrawals on my account.
[time=1666] And I looked at that number which was way, way too high.
[time=1671] And I thought, "What in the world is that?" And I called my banker and left a message for him.
[time=1677] He wasn't there.
[time=1678] And for the next 36 hours until he and I talked about it and I figured it out, I was just sick to my stomach.
[time=1682] I wanted to do a mini-depression of what in the world is going on.
[time=1685] And you know what I found myself doing?
[time=1687] I found myself doubting the resource.
[time=1690] Now, there were some mistakes.
[time=1692] There were some like inter-account transfers and stuff.
[time=1696] But I found myself also thinking, "Well, do I use everything that I have to advance God's kingdom?
[time=1702] Or do I doubt the resource?
[time=1704] Do I want to say to myself, "I earned it and it's mine or I don't believe that God will replenish it?" Well, the second thing we do is doubt the need in others.
[time=1711] We doubt the need in others.
[time=1712] And Deuteronomy 15, 7-11 tells us this.
[time=1716] Deuteronomy 15, 7-11, "If there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the land that the Lord your God is giving you,
[time=1723] same context as the previous Deuteronomy verse, do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted towards your poor brother.
[time=1728] Do not make life all about you, hard-hearted and tight-fisted." Rather be open-handed and freely lending whatever he needs.
[time=1735] Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought.
[time=1737] The seventh year, the seventh year for canceling debts is near.
[time=1740] They would cancel all debts.
[time=1742] Everything would go back to its original owner so that you do not show ill will towards your needy brother and give him nothing.
[time=1749] He may then appeal to the Lord against you, and you will be found guilty of sin.
[time=1755] Give generously to him and do so without a grudging heart.
[time=1759] Then because of this, the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.
[time=1767] There will always be poor people in the land.
[time=1769] We'll always have poor people around us.
[time=1771] Therefore, I command you to be open-handed towards your brothers and toward the poor and the needy in your land.
[time=1777] How do I love?
[time=1778] How do I not be open?
[time=1780] I'm sorry.
[time=1781] How do I not be apathetic?
[time=1782] How do I be tight-fisted?
[time=1783] How do I not be apathetic?
[time=1784] How do I love?
[time=1785] How do I not doubt the resource or the need?
[time=1788] That's what Paul answers, so stand on this reading.
[time=1795] Romans 12.
[time=1797] Romans 12, 13.
[time=1800] Share with God's people who are in need.
[time=1804] Practice hospitality, and now God may it be so in us.
[time=1807] Reveal yourself to us and through us.
[time=1810] Through Steve Wars in mind, agree with Corbin.
[time=1812] God have us decrease in you increase and communicate to us God what it is to have a heart.
[time=1817] A loving heart like yours.
[time=1819] A self-sacrificial love.
[time=1821] One that's not apathetic.
[time=1823] One that doesn't doubt the resource.
[time=1826] In Jesus' name we pray.
[time=1827] [AMEN - 1 seconds] You may be seated.
[time=1830] First thing, first thing he tells us, if you want to write it down, share.
[time=1837] Share with God's people who are in need.
[time=1841] That word share, it's a fascinating word.
[time=1845] It's contributing in the NASB.
[time=1847] You'll see it there if you have that Bible.
[time=1849] It's used in the Greek language.
[time=1851] It's really to communicate financial contributions.
[time=1855] It's about money.
[time=1857] So this passage of Scripture is not one of those times when we can say, you know, it's about your gift of your talent or whatever.
[time=1864] It's really about financial contributions in this case.
[time=1868] Share with God's people who are in need.
[time=1871] They are in the process of being transformed.
[time=1876] When Romans 12, 2 is true in you, that transformation is taking place.
[time=1881] Your "be-being" transformed is really what that word is.
[time=1884] It's a continual process.
[time=1886] When that's taking place and you realize the reality of what we were singing about today, when you're in transformation you're going, okay, God, then what are the things that you want me to do in this process?
[time=1898] Here's one of them.
[time=1900] He says we are to share with his people who are in need.
[time=1905] A few years ago I was trying to figure out the giving thing like everybody does.
[time=1912] And we preach on it periodically here because we really need to be faithful to teach our people the truth about giving to God.
[time=1920] And as I've looked through the New Testament, one of the things that I find to be true that's really hard for me is that the word that showed up there in 1st Chronicles
[time=1928] and what was the second passage that you read there, Deuteronomy 15?
[time=1932] The word "generous" shows up there in the Old Testament.
[time=1934] God was very specific about how much he wanted his people to give.
[time=1938] And there is some debate about that because some people think it's like 23% over the course of the time.
[time=1943] Others think it was like 33% as they look at that.
[time=1946] But God was specific about percentages and he tells them what to do.
[time=1949] That's where the word "tie" comes from.
[time=1951] In the Old Testament, God was pretty clear about that.
[time=1954] One of the things that he does in the New Testament that's been a struggle for me is he took the percentages away
[time=1960] and he put the word "generous" in there.
[time=1964] It shows up all through the New Testament.
[time=1967] Now, like I said, it showed up in the Old Testament as well.
[time=1970] He wanted people to be generous on top of what they were doing that was absolutely a must.
[time=1977] The word "generous" shows up.
[time=1980] Well, let's look at 1 Timothy 6.
[time=1987] As you look at that passage, just get ready if you're rich.
[time=1991] Now, and you cannot be in this room and not be.
[time=1996] What percentage?
[time=1997] 3%.
[time=1998] The wealthiest 3% in the world live in America.
[time=2002] If you were born in America, you are the bottom end in America.
[time=2006] You are in the wealthiest 3%.
[time=2007] You're in the top 3% of the world if you live in America, period.
[time=2012] Command those who are rich in this present world, you and me, no matter how much we have.
[time=2018] By the way, if you have less than somebody else here, I'd encourage you to pray for them.
[time=2022] Can you imagine the burden that it is to define "generous" if you have a lot?
[time=2028] We need to pray for the people that have more than you do.
[time=2032] But I do know this.
[time=2033] I feel the same tension in my life.
[time=2035] Command those who are rich in this present world, I am one.
[time=2039] It says not to be arrogant or put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain.
[time=2047] I'm not supposed to be arrogant about that and place my hope and put my security in that.
[time=2052] No.
[time=2053] But to put their hope in God who richly provides them with everything for their enjoyment.
[time=2059] Stop there for a second.
[time=2061] I had a guy that I bumped into and he was feeling really guilty about the new sports car that he had.
[time=2067] And it is a nice one.
[time=2069] Yeah.
[time=2070] And we were talking about it and I said, you know, describe it for me.
[time=2074] He told me what it was.
[time=2075] I like sports cars.
[time=2077] And he was telling me about the guilty.
[time=2079] I said, "Well, could we go out in the parking lot and look at it?" He goes, "Yeah." So we got in the parking lot.
[time=2083] We're looking at this thing.
[time=2084] I'm totally drooling.
[time=2086] And I said, I don't think, you know, 1 Timothy, chapter 60, he goes, "No, what is it?" I quoted all that that we just read.
[time=2093] "Be rich and who richly provides you with everything for your enjoyment." I said, "You can enjoy this car.
[time=2099] I want you to enjoy the things that he provides for you." I said, "But he also wants you to do the next part.
[time=2103] Look at the next part.
[time=2105] Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share their sports car."
[time=2112] [laughter] He laughed too.
[time=2117] At first, then he goes, then he started to get it.
[time=2120] He says, "Well, you use it this weekend." I said, "No, but a future weekend, I will, and it's really nice.
[time=2125] I'll just call me on a nice sunny prediction, and I'll take it." And I did.
[time=2130] I did use it.
[time=2132] Command those who are rich in this present world.
[time=2134] What do you want us to do?
[time=2135] Be generous with what he provides.
[time=2138] He provides, the resources are not limited.
[time=2143] He'll give me the resources that he wants me to have.
[time=2147] Then he wants me to be generous with them.
[time=2149] Let's look at another passage.
[time=2150] Oh, hold, hold, hold.
[time=2151] I just want to know if this next verse was true then for you.
[time=2153] That's right.
[time=2154] Chapter verse 19, go ahead.
[time=2155] You do that.
[time=2157] See that thing at the end?
[time=2158] That they may take whole of the life that is truly life.
[time=2161] Is that what happened to you when you're done?
[time=2163] It happened to me and to him when we drove that car.
[time=2165] Oh, that's awesome.
[time=2167] That's a great verse.
[time=2168] I shouldn't skip over that.
[time=2169] Look at that.
[time=2170] In this way, they will lay up treasure for themselves.
[time=2172] Those of us who share as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.
[time=2180] Laying up a foundation for the future life is what this life is about, and you get to
[time=2187] enjoy that.
[time=2188] Second Corinthians 8.
[time=2189] Let's look there.
[time=2190] In Second Corinthians chapter 8, we've got a story that's unbelievable.
[time=2193] Now, sharing, these take place we share with the people that are in our local body.
[time=2198] This particular passage is about the body in Macedonia sharing with the church that was in Jerusalem because they were struggling.
[time=2205] And look at this equation that Paul writes about the church in Macedonia.
[time=2209] Let it be so about you if you are going to suffer extreme poverty.
[time=2213] That's what these people were doing.
[time=2214] Look at it.
[time=2215] In Second Corinthians 8, it says verse 2, "Out of the most severe trial," that's one part
[time=2221] of the equation.
[time=2222] "Their overflowing joy," they had trial and joy, "and their extreme poverty adds up to
[time=2231] rich generosity." How's that work?
[time=2234] That didn't work in my math class or econ class.
[time=2237] That works in God's econ class.
[time=2240] Wow.
[time=2242] When you do things God's way, He said He will provide you with clothing and food and shelter
[time=2249] and He will.
[time=2253] Second Corinthians 8.
[time=2256] And then Hebrews 13, let's look at that real quickly.
[time=2259] Hebrews 13, 16, God says, "Do good."
[time=2265] Don't forget to do good and to share with others.
[time=2267] For with such sacrifices God is pleased.
[time=2270] You want to please God today?
[time=2272] Do good and share with others generously.
[time=2279] And last verse that we'll look at here, look at Romans 12a.
[time=2283] You see, this is a gift.
[time=2288] This gift of giving, contributing to the needs of others, is a spiritual gift that some people have.
[time=2294] In the list of gifts there in Romans 12, He says, "If it's encouraging, let him encourage if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give." There is my word again, generously.
[time=2308] Here's what I've enjoyed about that.
[time=2310] Years ago, when I was trying to figure out what our share was to provide these facilities,
[time=2318] utilities, maintenance costs, all the things that have come together with being in a local
[time=2324] organization called a local church, I figured this out.
[time=2329] If I had figured out, I was trying to figure out what would at least be fair and minimal.
[time=2333] That's what I was trying to do.
[time=2335] So I just said, "Okay, there are four of us in our household.
[time=2338] I need to give four at that time." It was four-eleven hundredths.
[time=2343] We had eleven hundred people when I finally figured this out.
[time=2346] Matter of fact, I think we had nine hundred, four-nine hundredths, and that was a bigger portion.
[time=2350] And then as the numbers grow, I figure out what's four, fifteen hundredths, so however
[time=2356] many people are attending here, and I divide that into our budget, and that's the minimum
[time=2362] that I'm going to give to Blackhawk Ministries, because I'm going to pay our fair share for the electric and the stuff like that.
[time=2368] And then I want to give more than that, because some people can't pay as much as I can.
[time=2372] So that's what I've done.
[time=2374] We've always just given that now.
[time=2376] I didn't stop there, because that's not giving an offering.
[time=2379] That's what I owe here as part of an organization.
[time=2383] So above that, our giving is then our offering, and our offerings that are giving.
[time=2389] And then I do outside of this organization, that kind of thing.
[time=2392] But you know what?
[time=2393] For me, it's been hard trying to figure out what generous is, because I've always had
[time=2399] this feeling that I'm living too well, no matter how much I give.
[time=2406] I think he wants me there, and I've always had these people around me who have that gift I just read about in Romans, and when I watched them give hilariously, cheerfully, that's
[time=2417] what it says, they're in Second Corinthians 8.
[time=2419] When I watch them, I want that.
[time=2422] Your great examples for us, those of you that have that gift, the rest of us need to do it because God tells us to.
[time=2430] You know, the word for share or contributing, you want to talk about that?
[time=2433] Well, I did just a little bit that it means financial contribution in partnership with
[time=2439] God.
[time=2440] Expand on that.
[time=2441] And how many people here have a credit union account of any kind?
[time=2446] Most of you who are in a credit union or some of your life insurance companies, I think there are three or four left in the United States, they're a mutual organization.
[time=2455] So what I own of that company is based on what I deposit.
[time=2461] The shareholders are the depositors.
[time=2464] And there's a ratio of whatever I deposit, that's how many shares I have, it's based on my deposit.
[time=2470] And I got to thinking, I don't think there's a one-for-one deal here, but it's evident of the heart and that's an illustration of what God's saying here.
[time=2477] As I share with those in need, it's indicative of a heart that owns shares in the kingdom
[time=2484] of God and his advancement in people's hearts and in their lives now.
[time=2491] And so if you wrote it down, you wrote number one share, I want you to write down, I have a resource and there is a need.
[time=2497] So you've talked about I have a resource.
[time=2499] I have a resource and I just want to touch on briefly, there is a need.
[time=2504] Steve mentioned about the famine in Jerusalem and Paul thought it would be really evident of people's hearts and their changed lives, these Gentiles, non-Jewish people that he went out and proclaimed the gospel of Christ to, that would be evidence of their lives if they would give to the Jewish Christians in need experiencing the famine in Jerusalem.
[time=2522] And we see that in the same letter in Romans 15, 25 through 27, it will come on the screen.
[time=2527] Romans 15, 25 through 27, Paul says this, "Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the saints there." There was a famine.
[time=2535] For Macedonia and Echaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
[time=2540] And this is what's really cool.
[time=2542] They were pleased to do it and indeed they owe it to them for if a Gentiles have shared in the Jews spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material
[time=2553] blessings.
[time=2554] There's that share in God's kingdom.
[time=2557] And the need here appears to be food, clothing, shelter, physical needs, and it's resources
[time=2563] that will meet those needs.
[time=2565] I have a resource.
[time=2567] There is a need.
[time=2568] Ephesians 4, 28, Paul says it this way, "He who has been stealing must steal no longer
[time=2574] but must work," and so what's work for?
[time=2578] Doing something useful with his own hands that he may have something to share with those in need.
[time=2584] It's God's idea what happens with work.
[time=2586] I have a resource and there is a need.
[time=2589] In Luke 3, John the Baptist has these people coming to be baptized and he says, "You brood of vipers," and then they say, "Well, why call us that?" And he says, "You know, your life needs to be indicative of the heart that you say you
[time=2605] have." And let's just pick it up there.
[time=2607] It's Luke 3, verse 7, "John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
[time=2617] Produced fruit in keeping with repentance." NLT says, "Live a life that's consistent and equal to what you say you believe and do
[time=2628] not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you that out of these stones God can raise, raise up children for Abraham."
[time=2639] Next verse.
[time=2640] The axe is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
[time=2647] And so the people say, "Well then, what should we do then?
[time=2651] What should we do to show that our lives indicate repentance?" And he says this, "The man with two tunics should share with him who has none and the
[time=2664] one who has food should do the same." There's a resource and there's a need.
[time=2671] I have a resource and there's a need.
[time=2674] Am I going to doubt the resource and not share?
[time=2678] Am I going to doubt the need and say it's not there?
[time=2683] I ran into an example of this real life right here, a couple in this church.
[time=2687] And I knew that the husband was, it's unique on how I got both ends of this story, but
[time=2693] I knew that the husband was going to be appreciated by his employer and he was given a significant gift.
[time=2699] And so it just came up that I was talking to him about that and I said, "Well, what did you do with it?" And he said, "Well, we paid some bills, but we gave most of it to a relative in need."
[time=2713] And I just sat there and inside I said, "Oh God, I want to heart like that.
[time=2720] I want to heart like that.
[time=2721] I want to heart that shares.
[time=2722] I don't want to doubt the resource.
[time=2724] I want to heart that shares." And that's what we're asking you to do today, is how not to be apathetic, how not to make
[time=2731] life all about me.
[time=2733] First thing Paul says is to share, "I have a resource.
[time=2737] There is a need.
[time=2738] Don't doubt the resource and don't doubt the need." And the second is care.
[time=2741] When it comes to sharing, you know, it's important for us in response to what God's done for
[time=2747] us and what he's provided for us.
[time=2750] In response to that, he wants us to look for the opportunities to share.
[time=2756] We need to go out there.
[time=2758] We need to go into your lives, into people's lives that are out in the lobby, into the people that have put their name on the vine tree.
[time=2763] We need to go outside and find people, even outside this local body, to share.
[time=2770] He wants us to look for opportunities because it brings him glory.
[time=2775] We get a blessing out of it and it meets a need.
[time=2781] Now caring, a different story.
[time=2784] Here the second part of 12-13 says, "Practice hospitality." When it shows up at your door, okay, you need to practice hospitality.
[time=2796] Hospitality shows up in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1.
[time=2800] We have a list of characteristics of the people who we can spot as elders in the church.
[time=2805] One of those character qualities in them is that they will be hospitable.
[time=2812] Hospitality was a customary thing.
[time=2813] Why don't you tell them about what they did there?
[time=2815] There weren't motels and hotels, per se, so when people would travel, they needed the lodging and Christians were traveling with letters and messages and it was really important
[time=2827] because sometimes their lives were threatened to have that lodging, to care for them, to practice hospitality.
[time=2833] There was this, I guess, written in both unwritten rule.
[time=2837] It was just like people who own Harleys today.
[time=2840] You never leave a fellow Christian.
[time=2842] You never leave a fellow Jew.
[time=2844] You never leave a fellow Harley owner stranded.
[time=2850] That's sobering.
[time=2852] They probably practice this better than we do.
[time=2857] But the Greek culture, those who were not in Christ, those outside of Christ, wouldn't think of the second thing of it.
[time=2863] They would think, you know, it is about me and I don't share and I don't care about those in need.
[time=2870] It's very interesting that in their hearts and interwoven in the fabric of their very beings was the Harley deal.
[time=2876] We never leave another one of our stranded.
[time=2879] It's about, hospitality is about meeting their very basal needs.
[time=2884] It's providing lodging.
[time=2885] It's really about that.
[time=2887] It's providing shelter and food and we need to practice that.
[time=2892] In 1 Peter, chapter 4, I know I have this resource.
[time=2897] I know I have the resources to practice hospitality.
[time=2900] In 1 Peter, chapter 4 says offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
[time=2907] Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others faithfully administering God's grace, His resources in its various forms.
[time=2920] There is a need.
[time=2922] One day I was in my office across the street and Teresa Scheimann was the secretary.
[time=2930] And we had, she was really good at protecting me from people that walked in without an appointment.
[time=2937] And I was busy doing something and she came, knocked, the door came in and she said, "Steve,
[time=2943] I know you're really busy.
[time=2944] I know we blocked this time for you to do this particular thing.
[time=2948] But there's a guy out here.
[time=2950] I can't tell you why, but he has to see you and I have to let him in." I said, "What's his name?" She said, "I don't know.
[time=2959] What's he want?
[time=2960] I don't know." But she said, "I just..." And so I said, "Okay." I trusted her.
[time=2966] The guy came in and he had on a 1940's hat and a trench coat and a tie and all of it
[time=2973] was old, but he was clean and he sat down and I don't know how long he was there.
[time=2980] I have no idea, but we sat and talked about nothing and I was mesmerized the whole time.
[time=2988] I can't tell you what we talked about.
[time=2990] I couldn't tell her later, but I knew this.
[time=2993] That guy, I needed to be hospitable too.
[time=2996] And I said, "Where are you going next?" And he said, "I'm going over to New Haven." And I said, "How are you going to get there?" And he said, "I'm walking." And I said, "Well, I need to take you." It wasn't like, "Do you need me to take you?" And I knew I needed to take him.
[time=3011] So I got in the car, drove over there, took him to a loading dock.
[time=3015] I don't even know where it was now.
[time=3017] When I came back, I walked in and Teresa said, "Who was that?" I said, "I don't know." She said, "What do you want?" I said, "He really didn't want anything." She said, "What were you doing?" I said, "What were you just talking?" To this day, I'm wondering, "Is that a Hebrews 13 deal?" Look there with me.
[time=3034] Do not forget to entertain strangers.
[time=3039] For by so doing, some people have entertained angels without knowing it.
[time=3044] I don't know if that guy was an angel.
[time=3045] He didn't tell me he was.
[time=3046] I've wondered for years about that guy.
[time=3051] He may have been protecting me from doing something else.
[time=3055] I don't have a clue what was going on.
[time=3056] He may have been protecting me from my own thoughts or thoughts that were coming from outside in.
[time=3061] I don't know what was going on there, but I know this.
[time=3065] I want to entertain strangers without fear, because God tells me to.
[time=3072] Matthew 25, it says this, Jesus said to the disciples and the people he was teaching.
[time=3078] He said, "You make sure you feed the hungry." He says, "You feed me." When I was hungry, you gave me food.
[time=3083] He says, "When I was thirsty, you gave me drink.
[time=3085] When I was a stranger, you took me in.
[time=3088] When I was in need of clothing, you clothed me.
[time=3091] When I was sick, you nurtured me.
[time=3094] When I was in prison, you visited me." They said, "What are you talking about?
[time=3097] You've never been there.
[time=3098] We've never done that for you." He said, "When you do this for the least of these, you have done it to me.
[time=3106] Do it." It's amazing to me, and this call came over me in the first hour.
[time=3114] How do I not be apathetic?
[time=3117] Share and care.
[time=3119] Share.
[time=3120] I have a resource, and there's a need.
[time=3123] Care.
[time=3124] I have a resource, and there's a need.
[time=3129] I had this phrase I wanted to put up on the screen for, "It is going to come up." I wanted to give you this twist, that God has a resource, and God's people have a need.
[time=3141] But I'm overwhelmed with that verse, "What you've done for the least of these, you've done for me." I want to say it this way.
[time=3148] God has a resource, and it's Christ.
[time=3150] Christ is the resource, and Christ is the need.
[time=3156] Christ is the need.
[time=3157] Christ is the resource, and Christ is the need.
[time=3161] You know what?
[time=3162] I said that.
[time=3163] So, in such an exclamatory way, do it.
[time=3167] The truth is, we get to do it.
[time=3171] It gives us the privilege of participating with Him for Him, exactly what you said.
[time=3177] We get to.
[time=3180] You know, I'll close with this story.
[time=3183] We're giving you one application today, just one, and it's the vine.
[time=3188] The vine was started by Laura Cox and got inspired a lot of people around her to come
[time=3195] to develop this ministry, and it's a ministry that just doesn't leave the fellow Harley owner
[time=3201] stranded.
[time=3202] It's a ministry to help those in need to share and to care for those in need in this local
[time=3209] congregation.
[time=3211] So we developed a arbor that has the vines on it out here in the foyer, and it's going to be right in the center as you exit, and on there are lists of needs, lists of needs of people who attend here and call Black Hawk home, and you can have an opportunity as you enter, and as you exit, these campuses all the time to make it a way of life to share
[time=3231] and to care for those in need, Christ is the resource, Christ is the need.
[time=3237] And I just want to share the story with you.
[time=3240] It's amazing.
[time=3241] There's a story after story after story, and I'm just picking one.
[time=3245] There was this family who attended here for eight years, and the husband lost his job, and actually his hours were just cut dramatically.
[time=3254] And Bill started to mount up.
[time=3255] They got behind on their mortgage payment, and they didn't have school supplies for the kids when school season started, it was the fall, and Laura's out there with a vine, and Laura held back their mortgage past due balance because it was so big.
[time=3270] She didn't know what to do.
[time=3271] She didn't even know to put it out there.
[time=3273] And a woman approached her and said, "I'd like to do something significant for somebody.
[time=3276] Do you have any large needs, not just gas or food, but do you have any larger needs?" And Laura said, "I can't believe you're asking me that." She said, "Why?" She said, "Well, I've held back this need.
[time=3285] I didn't even know what to do it.
[time=3286] I didn't even know what to put it on there." It was thousands of dollars, and it was the unpaid back mortgage payments on their home,
[time=3293] and they were going to get forced out of their home in the next few days.
[time=3297] Laura tells her, and the woman says, "I'll do that," and they go down to the bank, and they pay all those back payments.
[time=3305] Christ is the resource.
[time=3307] Christ is the need.
[time=3308] These people saw this grace, this grace.
[time=3311] Can you bring 2nd Corinthians 8-9 on the verse?
[time=3314] This is amazing to me.
[time=3316] This is one of the most powerful verses in the Bible.
[time=3317] 2nd Corinthians 8-9, it says that, 2nd Corinthians 8-9 talks about God's grace in Christ.
[time=3324] Verse 9, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and though He was rich, yet
[time=3332] for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich." And let me tell you what happened to the couple on the vine who had their mortgage back payments
[time=3343] paid.
[time=3345] This grace moved them, the sharing and caring moved them, and they wanted to realize that
[time=3351] they have resources, and other people have needs, and they went to crown, and now all their finances are in order, and now they share in care, and now they are involved in
[time=3362] a particular ministry here where they are sharing that grace of Christ.
[time=3366] Christ is the resource Christ is in need, and that's all we're asking.
[time=3369] Maybe not every time, but most of the time, when you walk by that vine, and you take off a card, and you fulfill that need, and you bring it back, you're acknowledging that Christ is a resource, and Christ is the need, and you're building His Kingdom, and it's like a mutual organization.
[time=3384] That's your ownership, those are your shares in God's Kingdom.
[time=3387] It's evident of your heart, that it's not apathetic, it's not all about me, it's not all about you, but it's about loving and self-sacrificial love of God and others.
[time=3395] Philippians 4-19 says it this way, it says, "My God will supply all your needs."
[time=3401] Look at this.
[time=3402] You can meet all your needs according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus, Christ is a resource, Christ is a need.
[time=3407] Do you know that that context is in people who shared?
[time=3411] That's who He's saying it to.
[time=3412] He's saying it to people.
[time=3413] He just got done talking about it, people who shared, because they got it.
[time=3418] They got it.
[time=3419] That Christ is a resource, and Christ is a need, and it's those who share, and those who care, those who love, and live out this love of God right here, right now, by realizing that we have the resource, and there is a need.
[time=3430] It's those people that God meets your needs in Christ.
[time=3435] I think we should pray or sing or both.
[time=3440] Corbin, you want to come up?
[time=3443] We sang that song, it was John 3.30, and it was, "I must decrease, he must increase."
[time=3449] I just thought, "What a way for us to leave, and before we walk through that vine, and
[time=3456] those needs, is to just ask God that, take away my heart of apathy, God.
[time=3461] Help me to share, help me to care, help me to not doubt the resource, help me to not doubt the need, and that would be our prayer." So why don't you just stand, and that is our prayer, when you're finished singing, you're dismissed.
[time=3471] There we go.
[time=3472] I lift you high, I lift you high, and bow down low, how high can you be, how who can
[time=3495] I go by, lift you high, and bow down low, how high can you be.
[time=3501] How low can I go, you must increase, I must decrease more, how about time and you will
[time=3518] be adored, you must increase, I must decrease more.
[time=3530] How about time and you will be adored, bow down, bow down and you will be adored, one
[time=3549] more time and bow down, bow down and you will be adored.
[time=3579] I lift you high, how high can you be, how high can you be, how high can you be, how
