[time=109] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, and I want to welcome you again to the Bible Hour.
[time=112] I'm so thankful that you've tuned in and grateful for this time that we get to spend together.
[time=117] You may be a viewer out in our viewing audience who tunes in.
[time=121] Often you may be part of the family, if you will.
[time=124] You may be new to the broadcast.
[time=126] Maybe today's the first time you've seen the Bible Hour, or maybe it's the second or third.
[time=131] Either way, I want you to know how grateful I am for the times that we get to spend together.
[time=136] And I want to say thank you to so many of you who continue to write in.
[time=140] You email me, you write us letters.
[time=143] We have conversations when we meet out and around the city or the community.
[time=148] And it just means a great deal to me to know that the efforts that we're making here to help those seeking find and then know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=159] To know that God is using those efforts to encourage you, to know that He's using these efforts to draw you closer to Him.
[time=168] It means a great deal to me and to our team.
[time=171] So thank you for the letters, thanks for the notes, thanks for the emails we love hearing from you.
[time=176] Hey, I want to remind you about an opportunity that takes place every week around Blackhawk.
[time=181] And it's not our Sunday morning service, but it's our Wednesday night service.
[time=185] It's called Common Ground.
[time=187] And Common Ground meets at 645 on Wednesday nights in the four-year area,
[time=193] right outside, right out in the front of our worship center.
[time=197] And Common Ground is led by Dr. Mitchell Crews.
[time=201] And many of you who tune into the Bible hour, you know and have become familiar with Mitchell's teaching and his leadership, you know what a blessing he has been to this place, and to our family.
[time=212] And Mitchell and the Common Ground team, they lead a worship service on Wednesday nights that is just an amazing time.
[time=218] It's highly interactive, it's highly personal, the Word of God has taught, the worship is amazing, and it is something I would want every one of you to experience and be a part of.
[time=228] And so if you got some time on a Wednesday night, if you're looking for a chance to reconnect midweek, if you need a place where you could go and be encouraged and be accepted and receive great teaching and have your heart stirred with some phenomenal worship, Common Ground is the place for you.
[time=246] 645 right here at Blackhawk in the four-year of the worship center, they would love to have you, Mitchell and the team would love to meet you, bring some friends and be a part of it.
[time=256] I want to thank you for the response that you've given to this series that we're in right now.
[time=260] You'll see again today a message from our journey through Romans 12 verses 9 to 21.
[time=266] We've entitled it Transformed Living.
[time=269] What it looks like when you and I give ourselves to the kind of transformational living that God calls us to.
[time=275] He says in Romans 12 to be transformed, not conformed.
[time=280] He wants your external expressions, your words and your attitudes and your values
[time=286] and your choices.
[time=287] He wants all of that to externally line up with the internal reality of what he has done in your heart and soul.
[time=295] If you know him personally, then Scripture teaches that he has changed you.
[time=300] He has redeemed you.
[time=302] He has made you new and Romans 12, 9 to 21 is a really, really amazing list.
[time=309] It's an incredible passage that paints a picture for us of what transformed living will look like.
[time=316] And I think today we find ourselves coming to part six of that study and a very challenging, challenging issue.
[time=324] How is it that you and I respond to those who have mistreated us?
[time=330] It says in Romans 12, 13, "Bless those who persecute you." And that's where our message goes this morning.
[time=338] I hope you'll open your heart and your mind to what he has to say to you through his word.
[time=343] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=345] And God bless you.
[time=346] Have a great week.
[time=347] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=350] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=577] Hey, I do want to welcome you back to our study of Romans, Chapter 12.
[time=581] Let me just say that I didn't know when we began what this would actually turn into.
[time=586] I have done my best. We have done our best to kind of just follow along as we feel like God has been leading and prompting us to do so.
[time=593] And this is actually, I believe, the sixth installment in this series that we've entitled "Transformed Living."
[time=600] "Transformed Living." If you'll open your Bibles to Romans 12, you'll find there in Romans, Chapter 12, verse 2, kind of what was back six weeks ago, the springboard for our study.
[time=611] You find there in Romans 12, too, this amazing phrase. Many of you have memorized this verse. Some of the kids in the room maybe are even familiar with it.
[time=618] For others of you here today, it may be completely new. It says there in Romans 12, too, and do not be conformed to this world.
[time=625] But be transformed, it says, by the renewing of your mind.
[time=631] Here's where we've been. Just follow with me if you can't hear. In a nutshell, here's where our journey has taken us so far.
[time=638] Paul says to those believers, those who had fully surrendered and committed their lives to Christ.
[time=644] This church at Rome, he says to them, "Hey, church, don't be conformed to this world."
[time=651] That phrase right there was a very interesting phrase. It meant don't pretend.
[time=655] Don't act in certain ways. Don't don't say certain things. Don't harbor certain attitudes.
[time=660] Don't possess certain values that are not consistent with what God has made you.
[time=666] In your relationship with him, Paul's saying, "He's made you new." In your relationship with him, you have been redeemed.
[time=673] In your relationship with him, old things have gone away, new things have come. He says, "Don't pretend to be what you're not.
[time=680] Don't be conformed to this world." He says, "But be transformed."
[time=686] An amazing, very powerful word. The word "transformed" there means to a line. We've talked about this.
[time=692] It means to a line, to line up, to have in unison or in harmony your external expressions.
[time=702] Who you are, the things that you say, the stuff that you think, the way that you conduct yourself.
[time=707] He says, "Take your external expressions," and he urges. He pleads with them. He says, "Line them up.
[time=714] Be consistent externally with who you are spiritually, internally. Be transformed."
[time=721] And so we ask the question, "Well, what does that look like?
[time=725] How could I maybe gain a picture of what transformed living really looks like?"
[time=731] And we go to chapter 12, verse 9 through 21. And as you read 9 through 21, you begin to see in very specific and very clear ways.
[time=741] God laying out for us this picture of transformed living.
[time=745] We began in our study. I told you the passage kind of breaks down into four sections.
[time=751] The first section had to do with your personal expression of being transformed.
[time=757] The first section had to do with your personal life.
[time=761] Transformed living as it related just to you and your own heart and mind and soul.
[time=766] And we found all of that kind of packed into verse 9.
[time=769] Let love be without hypocrisy, abhor what is evil, cling to what is good.
[time=775] And that was a powerful study, a powerful discussion that we were able to have as a family over a couple of weeks.
[time=782] And then we went from the personal component of transformed living out to the next circle, if you will.
[time=789] As the passage begins to unfold, as we come to verses 10 through 13, we see transformed living.
[time=796] Now, as it relates to the way you and I react, the way you and I relate together.
[time=802] Here in this little passage within the bigger passage, 10 to 13, we see transformed living in biblical community.
[time=810] The way in which you and I are to be with each other.
[time=813] Be devoted to one another verse 10 and brotherly love.
[time=817] Give preference to one another in honor, not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,
[time=823] rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer.
[time=828] And then Mitch and Steve concluded that short passage last week with verse 13,
[time=834] contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality, transformed living in biblical community.
[time=842] We've looked at the personal arena.
[time=844] We've looked at biblical community and how this transformed living is to show itself in that setting.
[time=850] And now this morning we come to a third arena.
[time=853] But I want to say this before we go on.
[time=855] The response that we've heard.
[time=858] And there's always response. People are always writing in, people are always calling in, people are always emailing in.
[time=865] You and those who listen I think through the broadcast, you have always been very gracious and very supportive.
[time=872] Recently in the last six weeks, the response has been kind of like through the ceiling, like way above normal.
[time=881] Gracious, I mean kind, but more than gracious and kind it would seem as if from what is happening in your hearts and lives,
[time=888] as we travel down this Romans 12 road together, it would appear as if God is doing some amazing things.
[time=895] And somebody asked me the other day, why do you think that is?
[time=898] Why do you think in Romans 12, 9 to 21, as we've been trying to just kind of teach through phrase by phrase this passage,
[time=904] why do you think the response has been so overwhelming?
[time=907] And I want to just say this to you two things.
[time=911] Number one, and I can say this from experience. Let me say that.
[time=915] Number one, I want to just say something to believers in the room today.
[time=922] There has been a response from believers in our midst over these last six weeks that has been really, really escalating.
[time=930] And here's why I think that is, when you're a believer, when you know the Lord,
[time=937] but maybe you're living maybe in the day-to-day of your life, and I've been there,
[time=945] maybe you're growing weary of the conformed to this world life.
[time=954] You see, when you're stuck in that rut, when you're really not living and really not choosing
[time=962] and really not thinking and really not valuing the things that you in your heart know God has called you to,
[time=968] when you are living, even as a believer, a conformed to this world lifestyle, we get weary of that.
[time=979] And so then when all of a sudden the picture gets painted of the life that God has called us to, when you and I begin to kind of stand up and take note of what it is that He has made us to be the way it is,
[time=992] He's called us to live when you get this picture painted for you, as God's Word has painted it lately for us.
[time=998] I think for many believers, it's a wake-up call, and it is a reminder of the life that He intended you and I to live.
[time=1006] And I think our response then comes from that. I also want to say this to those of you in the room that don't know Him yet.
[time=1013] You know how thankful we are for you and for the chance to share in this journey with you.
[time=1019] And I can speak as one who used to sit where you sit.
[time=1024] And I remember today what it was like to not know Him, to be on the outside spiritually looking in.
[time=1031] And when you're in that state and somebody stands up and they paint for you, when the Word of God paints for you and describes for you a picture of life the way God intended, and you know down deep in your heart that you're nowhere near living that life, you begin to realize how much you are missing.
[time=1048] You begin to hunger more than you ever had for peace and for forgiveness.
[time=1054] And I've heard from several of you in recent weeks, those of you searching, and I can tell how much this means to you.
[time=1061] And I would simply stand here today and encourage you to continue to journey on, to continue to ask the questions that you need to ask, to continue to open your heart, and to see what God will in fact do with that heart as you continue to lay it open before Him.
[time=1078] So I'm thankful for where we've been on all fronts.
[time=1081] And today we come to the third section of our passage, and we find it here in verses 14 to 16.
[time=1087] Transformed living as it relates to everybody.
[time=1092] Write that down.
[time=1093] Transformed living with all people, verses 14 to 16.
[time=1097] Everyone saved, unsaved, still searching, Christ followers, and those far from God.
[time=1102] There is a way that God calls us to live with everyone in all situations, and I want us this morning to look at a few.
[time=1110] Honor God's Word, would you this morning and stand with me as I read this to you Romans 12 verses 14 to 16.
[time=1117] A look at transformed living with all.
[time=1120] It says, "Bless those in verse 14, bless those who persecute you.
[time=1125] Bless and do not curse.
[time=1127] Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
[time=1132] Be of the same mind toward one another.
[time=1134] Do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly.
[time=1138] Do not be wise in your own estimation."
[time=1144] Pray with me, if you would, Father God, we humbly and quietly, and I pray God this morning honestly.
[time=1155] I pray God that each person in this room would, here in this moment, stand before you in humility and honesty.
[time=1167] And wherever we've been, Father, whatever choices we've made, whatever patterns may exist in our hearts.
[time=1178] Whether we are saved and redeemed, children of God, now wrestling with this process of sanctification, Father,
[time=1188] or whether we're still on the outside spiritually looking in, God, wherever those in this room or those listening today
[time=1196] would find themselves, "God, I pray that you would meet us there.
[time=1200] God, I pray that you would not only just meet us there, but that you would with your great love and mercy and with the great truth of the Scripture.
[time=1208] God, I pray that you would enlighten our hearts and our minds.
[time=1212] God, that you would make clear for us what is right.
[time=1215] God, that you would move us in that direction and that you would give us the strength to be the people,
[time=1221] the transformed body of Christ that you've called us to be.
[time=1226] We asked that this morning, Father, with great humility and with great anticipation and with great hope.
[time=1234] And we'll look forward to you doing that in us, in your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1239] You can be seated.
[time=1244] Transform living with all people and it begins here in verse 14 where it says, "There you have it, bless those who persecute you, bless and curse not."
[time=1262] This is a challenging one.
[time=1265] My friends, this one will stretch you.
[time=1271] This one stretches me.
[time=1275] This one is a stretch for the human heart.
[time=1280] Bless those who persecute you.
[time=1285] This command in fact runs, if you think about it, it's pretty obvious.
[time=1289] It runs absolutely contrary to the unredeemed soul.
[time=1294] You and I in our humanness, you and I in our sinfulness, you and I, anybody living life apart from God,
[time=1300] with the unredeemed heart and soul, this is absolutely contrary to anything and everything
[time=1307] that runs through us.
[time=1310] And there is only one way, think about it, there is only one way to bless, only one way to be kind toward, to be gracious to a persecutor.
[time=1322] Think about it.
[time=1324] How does one do this?
[time=1326] Really, how is it that someone like you, how is it that somebody like me could actually
[time=1334] and genuinely and effectively bless somebody who persecutes you?
[time=1342] How can you obey and follow Jesus when he says in Luke, you can turn there if you'd like, Luke 6.
[time=1348] I'm going to read this whole passage to you, 27 through 33.
[time=1352] How is it that you and I could genuinely and effectively obey and follow Jesus when he
[time=1359] says in Luke 6, 27, you see it there on the screen, it says, "But I say to you, who hear,
[time=1365] love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you,
[time=1371] pray for those who mistreat you." It goes on in verse 29 to say, "Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also, and whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him either.
[time=1385] Give to everyone who asks of you and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it
[time=1391] back." He goes on in 31 to say, "Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.
[time=1398] If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
[time=1402] For even sinners love those who love them." And then he concludes in 33, "If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is
[time=1410] that to you?
[time=1411] For even sinners do the same."
[time=1417] Only one way to do that.
[time=1423] There is only one way for that to be a genuine response from a human soul to someone who has
[time=1432] brought judgment to someone who has brought abuse to someone who has brought persecution.
[time=1436] Bless those and persecute you.
[time=1439] How?
[time=1440] You've got to be redeemed.
[time=1444] The only way that can ever work is when a human soul is made new.
[time=1449] The only way that can ever be a reality in your heart or mind is when we open ourselves
[time=1455] to the saving work of Christ who by grace through faith has made salvation and redemption and
[time=1463] transformation possible.
[time=1465] It's the only way.
[time=1466] You cannot live separated from the heart of God.
[time=1470] You cannot live spiritually on the outside looking in.
[time=1474] You cannot be detached from relationship with God and somehow muster up enough strength in
[time=1481] you to bless those who persecute you.
[time=1489] Only in a fully surrendered relationship with Christ as your heart and life are transformed
[time=1495] by the renewing of your mind are you able to bless.
[time=1499] When your heart and your mind are renewed and given new life by the Spirit of God and
[time=1505] the Word of God supported by the people of God, when you are by God's grace and by God's strength redeemed and in the process of being transformed, He then and only then can empower
[time=1517] you and enable you to turn the other cheek.
[time=1524] To pray for the guy or gal who has brought such wrong against you.
[time=1534] Let me just ask you that this morning, why not, why not, let's just be as practical as
[time=1540] we could be, who has brought wrong against you.
[time=1546] And we learn here that it is the person of Christ and it is the Spirit of God that indwells you that enables you to bless them and not verbally or even mentally just slaughter them
[time=1558] with your words.
[time=1561] Who has done that?
[time=1563] Who has mistreated you?
[time=1566] He empowers you to be gracious and kind in the face of abuse, in the face of mistreatment,
[time=1574] in the face of the unkind word, somebody who has postured themselves with you or said
[time=1580] things about you, who's done that?
[time=1583] Go ahead, put a face with that this morning and let's just be as honest and as real as
[time=1591] we can be before God.
[time=1593] He enables you in relationship with Him, He enables you to serve and even reach out to
[time=1599] those who have brought great pain to your life.
[time=1604] Who's done that?
[time=1607] Who's brought great pain to your life?
[time=1615] He reminds you, He enables you in relationship with Him that love, not hate, that love wins,
[time=1626] that love wins.
[time=1630] Love always wins, not hate, not gossip, not vengeance, not you quietly or loudly criticizing
[time=1640] Him or Her behind their backs, no love wins and He enables you and He empowers you to
[time=1646] not just remember that but to act on that and bless those who mistreat you.
[time=1654] We're talking to somebody this week and I think in a halfway humerus but I think halfway
[time=1660] serious way as we talked about this, their response was okay, okay, I get it, bless the
[time=1666] jerk and I thought about that and I laughed a little bit like you just did but then you
[time=1674] know what, I said wait a minute now to myself, I said you know we've got to back up there a little bit.
[time=1681] I understand the jerk comment, you do too but see when we bless those who persecute us,
[time=1690] I think somewhere in the midst of that there's a call for you and I to back up and not just be willing to bless but to see the individual for who they are and you and I know, I mean
[time=1702] down deep inside you and I know that there's a reason, he's a jerk, there's a reason she's
[time=1709] saying what she's saying, there's a reason he did what he did, he's sinful, she's broken
[time=1718] and our humanists were just cracked vessels and it's not like it's supposed to be and
[time=1725] so cracked broken people do stupid things, it's not blessed the jerk, it's blessed the
[time=1734] broken and yes what they did has hurt, yes what he did was unspeakable, yes we understand
[time=1743] the trauma and the hurt and the rejection, all of that valid but he calls us too with
[time=1751] our spirit and our heart to be willing to extend in appropriate ways gracious kindness, blessing
[time=1761] to a person who is broken, I'll never forget being just maybe six months into my own personal
[time=1767] journey with the Lord I had come to faith and maybe it was six, seven, eight months later I was growing and I was learning all kinds of new things and it absolutely floored me.
[time=1777] Then the pastor of the church where I got saved who we were good friends with and I knew his wife, the pastor's wife and the pastor's wife had a nephew who I knew, her brother's boy and this nephew of our pastor and his wife one night working in a convenience
[time=1795] store working his tail off just trying to earn enough money to get through school I think it was 19, 20 years old a cocaine addict enters the store absolutely through the ceiling high
[time=1808] looking for money pulls out a gun and shoots this kid kills him cold blood reaches over
[time=1815] pulls out 180 bucks and leaves surveillance cameras capture the whole thing he's captured
[time=1824] within four days brought in sentence convicted life in prison and it absolutely floored
[time=1834] a new believer as I watched my pastor's wife or brother you know this kid's dad for weeks
[time=1845] and weeks and weeks for months and months and months and later I learned for years went
[time=1852] on a regular basis to visit the man who had taken his son's life and he didn't go to
[time=1862] wag a finger and he didn't go to further heap on the guilt he went to befriend him and
[time=1868] he went to share with him the hope that was within him he goes and he sits in a chair
[time=1876] and speaks through a glass to the man who murdered his son for months and months and for years and years and I can't say nor I wouldn't guess many of you who have any idea
[time=1890] how difficult that would be but if ever there has been in my own life just an example of
[time=1896] one who was willing to bless when he had been persecuted that was it who is it for you
[time=1903] my friends I don't want you to get on to the next point here without thinking about that who do you need to speak with this week who do you need to write a note to who do you need to extend an act of kindness to who is it that has wronged you who is it that has mistreated you and there may not be anything you can really do about that but maybe this week you could bless them maybe somehow this week you could come all up alongside maybe
[time=1930] somehow this week you could communicate maybe somehow you could put your pain into the hands of the one who heals it and extend a gracious heart and bless someone who has persecuted
[time=1942] you ball goes on to say rejoice with those who rejoice you see it there verse 15 he goes
[time=1950] on to say rejoice with those just next point in our passage as it continues to unfold rejoice
[time=1957] with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep let's look at this rejoicing with
[time=1964] those who rejoice concept at first glance this one seems a whole lot easier than the
[time=1971] blessing you know towards those who persecute us but I want you to look at it closely because really it presents quite a challenge in some respects look at the text it says rejoice you
[time=1983] and I are to rejoice with those who are rejoicing it speaks to the emotional condition of who
[time=1992] of the other when someone else has cause for rejoicing it says rejoice with them be joyful
[time=2000] with them same word as before that we looked at a couple of weeks ago express the joy with
[time=2007] them well you know what if you if you win the lotto and I win the lotto next week it's
[time=2016] really really fun to rejoice together if you get a new house and I get a new house then it's great to rejoice together in the natural human heart my friends we will rejoice with
[time=2027] others till the cows come home as long as we have something to rejoice in together am I
[time=2034] making sense I don't think I don't think that's a challenge and I think the passage begs the
[time=2043] question what's my response though when another person's blessing or another person's happiness
[time=2056] comes at my expense now do you want to rejoice or when their success or their accomplishment
[time=2066] or their recognition or their prominence makes my efforts seem meaningless or at best
[time=2072] menial then how ready am I to rejoice with those who are rejoicing how willing are we
[time=2083] to rejoice when they hit the lotto and we don't when their marriage has improved and yours
[time=2090] hasn't when their kids are doing really well spiritually and academically and socially
[time=2098] and yours aren't when he or she gets to play maybe you're on the basketball team or maybe
[time=2107] you're on the football team or maybe you're on the soccer team or maybe you're on the golf team I don't know maybe you're on a team and maybe somebody else gets to play and you
[time=2116] sit on the bench and they don't just get to play but maybe they even do really really
[time=2122] well and excel rejoice with those who rejoice when he gets the promotion or she gets the
[time=2133] promotion at work and all that comes with the promotion and you've worked just as hard
[time=2139] for just as long when they go on nicer trips than you do and they want to come back and
[time=2148] show you those stupid pictures okay okay I've been there I'm sorry it's a public confession
[time=2161] when their ministry is getting bigger than yours when she gets asked out on a date and
[time=2171] you don't she's so excited or when they're pregnant again and you're still trying to
[time=2181] just have one for the natural human heart my friends these situations are impossible
[time=2192] in those situations and many others just like them naturally in our humanness and in our human sinfulness we will not rejoice no naturally we will different words starts with an hour
[time=2204] we will resent resentment in the natural human heart rules in those situations and yet God
[time=2212] calls you and I in transformed living by the strength and power of his might to be rejoicing
[time=2221] when a human heart is redeemed don't miss this when a human heart is redeemed when a human heart in life begin to be transformed the impossible I've seen it I've experienced it I've watched
[time=2232] it with my own eyes when a human heart is redeemed when a life is saved the impossible
[time=2239] becomes common it becomes doable and I don't mean doable by your own strength I mean the
[time=2245] spirit of God that indwells you and the way he begins to grow you what once seemed absolutely
[time=2252] insane now you you can choose and now he empowers you to do it is distinctively Christian and
[time=2268] I hope you get this this morning it is distinctively Christian to rejoice in the blessings in
[time=2274] the favor in the honor in the wealth and the promotion of others regardless of our personal
[time=2281] circumstance we can rejoice remember joy we defined it the deep seated sense of peace
[time=2288] that a loving heavenly Father is thoughtfully and with purpose orchestrating the events of my life and theirs and whatever he allows whatever comes to pass I know because I know
[time=2299] him and his goodness and his wisdom that he's allowed it and I can rejoice in that and their
[time=2306] blessing and their favor and their honor and their wealth who who brought that in the first
[time=2313] place who God did so it's all it's all good I'll rejoice with you my personal circumstance
[time=2326] might not be so good my personal situation may be a bit different but if in the in the
[time=2333] goodness of our God he has chosen to bring you there I will rejoice with you wholeheartedly
[time=2340] look at what it says in 1 Corinthians 12 1 Corinthians 12 26 write this down make a little
[time=2347] note underline it if you if you do that kind of thing 1 Corinthians 12 26 so powerful and if one member here we're talking about the the body of Christ verse 26 and if one member
[time=2362] suffers all the members what say it suffer with it if one member is honored all the members
[time=2369] what say it rejoice with it now I'll tell you what I believe just personally my friends
[time=2380] that these are issues these things that we talk about this morning these things that we find here in our passage today I believe these I think these are the deep issues of
[time=2392] the Christian life I believe your willingness in mind to to live out transformed living in these ways to open ourselves to these kinds of choices and decisions I think this speaks
[time=2403] volumes I think this is powerful stuff and I want to take you to our next point which I believe is just as powerful and just as significant and I don't want you to miss anything in
[time=2414] here it says rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep mourn with those
[time=2421] who mourn weep weep with those who weep I want you to I want you to watch this I want
[time=2431] you to watch something here came across a teaching it's a little short film and I really want you to pay attention this morning I wouldn't bring this to you in this format if I didn't feel like there was some great truth for you to hear for some of you in the room this morning this may be a little difficult I want to just say that to you my hope in my
[time=2451] prayer is that you'll you'll hang with it and listen and allow the truth that is spoken to fill your heart my friends coming alongside others is something that God calls us to do
[time=2463] it is a powerful powerful opportunity to be the people that God has called us to be and
[time=2469] whether it's rejoicing with those who rejoice when you don't really feel like it or whether it's weeping with those who weep when you don't really feel like it my friends it's what God calls us to I want you to watch this and I want you to listen very carefully I'm going to come back up when it's done and we'll share some concluding thoughts but I would encourage you every one of you to some degree this will apply to you and I just hope the
[time=2495] spirit of God can speak through this and encourage your hearts and souls I know it did mine as I've watched it now a few times but listen and I'll come back in just a moment.
[time=2529] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=2625] Several years ago when I was studying to become a pastor I became friends with this family
[time=2633] and they had this son named Matthew and this kid this kid was so unusual he like he like
[time=2645] it's hard to put it in the words he had this old soul you know what I mean he was only a high school student probably 15 or 16 but he was thinking about things and wrestling
[time=2656] with issues so so ahead of his time and I remember I would have discussions with people
[time=2664] who knew Matthew and we'd say like what do you think that kid what do you think he's going to do someday and what's he going to do with this life and we would all say whatever it is it'll be extraordinary I mean this kid was so talented and things became really
[time=2683] tough for his family and his parents split up and so he came to live with me.
[time=2691] So I'm this you know seminary student in my early 20s and I'm helping this high school
[time=2697] kid get off to school in the morning I was like this surrogate big brother I will never
[time=2707] forget those days and then he graduated and moved away to go to school and work and then
[time=2718] I got a job on the other side of the country and so we would keep in touch and he came to visit me one time and when I was in town I'd look him up and we'd catch up and tell our stories and then I got a call that Matthew had been in a terrible car accident and that
[time=2737] he was in the hospital in critical condition and then a couple hours later the same person
[time=2746] called back and they said Rob he didn't make it and it's like yeah I keep replaying that
[time=2761] moment like Rob Matthew he didn't make it I have such such vivid memories like even
[time=2774] where I was sitting how the phone felt in my hand it's like this numb feeling this feeling
[time=2784] that like everything's moving and yet it's standing perfectly still and if there's anything
[time=2792] I've learned or I'm learning it's that whatever you're feeling in that moment it's okay it's
[time=2801] okay it's okay to feel numb and for me it's like an anger shock denial it's okay or just
[time=2813] that feeling you don't feel anything at all and that's that's okay too and it's okay to
[time=2820] have no answers and no explanations and and maybe even no words you know what does help
[time=2834] is that Jesus wept there's a there's a story in the book of John Jesus friend Lazarus dies
[time=2844] and a couple days later Jesus goes to Lazarus's village and his family is there and his friends
[time=2851] and they're all gathered around and they're all just sobbing they're all like just mourning
[time=2859] their loss and gee and Lazarus's sisters are even saying to Jesus you know if you if you would have been here earlier you know maybe this wouldn't have this would have happened and Jesus enters into this just big giant mess and he says well the scripture says that
[time=2878] he's a that he's deeply moved in his spirit somewhere deep down he just connects with
[time=2888] this whole mess and then the and then the Bible reads these two words Jesus wept he
[time=2895] feels all this pain and loss and he enters into it any he lets the full force of the
[time=2905] moment hit him it's because like you have to let it hit you you can't avoid it we can't
[time=2919] like avoid our responses to things and think they'll go away if we stuff it and then it's
[time=2926] in there somewhere and it will come out we have we have to let it out or it's in there
[time=2935] somewhere and maybe you lost somebody a long time ago and you never properly grieved then
[time=2948] it's still in there somewhere it's still in there if the son of God needs to let it out
[time=2959] if Jesus wept and then we do too there's an ancient Jewish practice that is taps into
[time=2973] this in a profound way for me it's it's called sitting Shiva and when you lose somebody that
[time=2983] you love or like if you know somebody who loses somebody that they love that then you go over
[time=2989] to their house and you sit with them you just sit and you don't say anything if at some
[time=3007] point they want to talk then you talk and if they prefer silence then there's silence
[time=3031] I don't know if you've lost somebody close to you I mean maybe it was years and years
[time=3038] ago or maybe it was a couple of days ago I mean I don't know how long ago or if it was
[time=3049] just the other day I am so sorry I am so sorry for your loss I do know I do know that
[time=3071] you and I have choices about the kinds of people we are and the kinds of people we're
[time=3078] becoming we have a choice whether or not we're gonna become bitter there's this woman in
[time=3085] the Bible named Naomi and she loses her husband and her two sons and and she says don't don't
[time=3092] call me Naomi anymore call me Mara the word Mara is the Hebrew word for bitter she's like
[time=3098] don't call me Naomi call me bitter a man named Job in the scriptures loses everything children
[time=3107] houses possessions and his wife says are you still holding on to your integrity curse God
[time=3113] and die she becomes I don't know she becomes consumed with her bitterness and if we don't
[time=3124] acknowledge this choice if we let a little bit of bitterness in it'll take over maybe
[time=3132] you let that in a long time ago more maybe you had that sense of guilt that comes with that if only I would have done this that wouldn't have happened if only I would have been this way if if I would have done something differently and so we could become a wracked with guilt and and and it like seeps in and it becomes a part of us we're not even aware
[time=3153] of it don't let it happen don't let it happen there's this this ancient song where the writer
[time=3168] says to God it's like this prayer where he's just pouring out his pain and he says you've
[time=3174] made me see trouble you've made me see troubles many and bitter but you will restore me again
[time=3186] it's easy it's easy when we suffer loss it's easy when we suffer loss for whatever it is
[time=3197] that we lost to become the center of our life we had them and now they're gone and so there's
[time=3203] like this giant hole where they once wore where and it becomes all we can think about
[time=3212] and what happens in the process is our whole life becomes what we don't have and we lose out on what we do have your heart my heart it will recover it will recover it will never
[time=3232] our hearts will never be the same again but we will recover the first Christians spoke
[time=3242] about a day in the future when God would restore everything you me everything in heaven and
[time=3253] on earth I find great hope in that some may you may you realize that Jesus Jesus left and
[time=3274] may may you come to see that whatever you're feeling it's okay it's okay and may you make
[time=3281] the choice me and make the choice not to become bitter and closed but open and may you realize
[time=3293] that God is sitting Shiva with you fully present grieving your loss but also restoring and
[time=3307] in that may we find hope.
[time=3337] Well would you maybe just do this with you would just bow your heads and close your eyes
[time=3357] each and every one of you please do that and I think just symbolically if we can do this
[time=3365] I understand that there would be more to it than this and I hope and pray that on a personal level there would be great sensitivity exercised on your part to those in your world who may
[time=3377] need this this sitting Shiva this willingness to come and be with but I'll tell you what
[time=3384] just in the quietness of this room as we go with every head bowed and every eye closed
[time=3392] if you're mourning today for whatever reason it may be a literal physical loss it may be
[time=3400] a relational loss there may just be a great sense of sorrow in your heart today but if
[time=3406] you're mourning today if you're weeping today for whatever reason maybe if you would just
[time=3412] be trusting enough of us and our love for you would you just quietly stand with every
[time=3420] head bowed and every eye closed if you would just be willing to stand this morning where
[time=3426] you are mourning weeping for whatever reason just stand quietly I sure appreciate that just
[time=3441] stand quietly and I don't know your loss I'm not sure of what your situation is but I
[time=3451] just want you to hear me say to you that we love you and that you as part of this family if in fact you are if you're not we'd sure love you to be we want to do what we can and
[time=3462] so we will now just symbolically we will just symbolically because we love you we will
[time=3469] as a family now stand with you and I will just ask the rest of you if you would just
[time=3475] stand quietly father God we stand this morning quietly in the midst of those who hurt and
[time=3484] for whatever reason God for whatever has transpired whatever has caused the hurt whatever circumstance
[time=3491] they may find themselves in today God I pray that in a special way they would sense your love and our commitment to them if there's anything we can do father on a personal basis
[time=3502] with those who stood around us God if there's a greater sensitivity that we need to those in our lives to come alongside and mourn and weep with those who mourn and we've got give
[time=3512] us that strength thank you for this morning and thank you for the truth that your word has spoke God had prayed that you would give us courage and strength of heart to apply these
[time=3523] things to our lives so that we could live as redeemed and transformed people and everybody
[time=3531] was grateful and everybody agreed and said Amen God bless you.
