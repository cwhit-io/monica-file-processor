[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=59] and on earth; therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of
[time=70] the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=81] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=87] the end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=117] Hey, allow me, if I can, just a moment here, to invite you to prepare your heart for something
[time=128] extremely special and something that God takes very seriously and that we are very thankful
[time=136] to get to participate in together as a family, and that is coming to this table.
[time=142] And remembering the sacrifice of our Lord, His broken body and His spilled blood as a
[time=150] child of God as someone who has entered into that personal relationship with Him.
[time=157] And that's what this is for today.
[time=159] If you know Him personally, if there is a commitment in your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ, this
[time=167] is an opportunity for you to come and take a few moments and remember the sacrifice that
[time=173] He made and all that has come with that.
[time=177] If you don't know Him yet, maybe you're here this morning and you still haven't come to
[time=183] that place where you have fully given and fully surrendered your heart and life to Him, then we would invite you just to be here with us but to not participate in this.
[time=194] It's so very clear in the Scriptures that this is something that we as followers of Christ are commanded to participate in.
[time=203] It's a privilege to get to do so.
[time=206] And I just want to ask each and every one of you here this morning, whoever you are, if you know Him, we're reminded in 1 Corinthians 11 that a man must, it says in 11, 27, "Therefore
[time=219] whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord," that's this, "whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body
[time=230] and the blood of the Lord, but a man must examine himself."
[time=236] See if you don't want to be guilty, if you don't want to be in God's eyes, disrespectful
[time=245] or out of line or really, I guess, in sin as you come to this, the way to move beyond
[time=252] that the Scriptures teaches for you to examine yourself.
[time=258] When there's sin in your heart, when there's sin in your life, when this morning on the
[time=264] way here or back at the house or last night or this week, if there's choices that have
[time=273] been made, attitudes that have been harbored, decisions that you've followed through with that were sinful, and you haven't confessed that, you haven't made that right with Him.
[time=284] Now is an opportunity as you come to this table to do so.
[time=290] It says, "For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does
[time=297] not judge the body rightly." After this reason, many among you are weak and sick and a number sleep.
[time=305] God takes it very seriously.
[time=307] So I want to invite you, as Josh and the team come back to lead us through some more songs and a chance to lift your voices, you may want to lift your voice, you may want to just take a moment.
[time=318] If you're like me, it may be one of the few quiet moments you get today or even this week,
[time=325] and I would encourage you to take advantage of it.
[time=328] You may need to confess some things.
[time=329] There may be some things you need to say to Him.
[time=332] In your heart before God this morning, we would invite you to just enjoy some time of quiet reflection.
[time=338] Tell them what you're grateful for.
[time=340] Tell them.
[time=341] Tell them what you're sorry for.
[time=343] Seek the forgiveness that only he can grant.
[time=346] If there's relational issues brewing at home or with friends, make sure today this morning you would purpose in your heart to make those right.
[time=355] Allow the music and allow the time with Him, allow this moment to be for you an opportunity
[time=361] to reflect, an opportunity to connect with Him.
[time=364] And then when you're ready, you just make your way on your own time here.
[time=368] Just make your way up and take the cup and the bread and go back to your seat.
[time=372] And then when it's in your own heart, the right time you do that.
[time=378] No one will instruct you on that this morning.
[time=380] You just come and participate in that and we'll sing through these songs and then I'll come back up in a little bit.
[time=387] But to thank you, thank you for taking it seriously and I would encourage you to use the time to remember the sacrifice, to thank Him for all that that has brought you, and
[time=398] to make right whatever may need to be made right.
[time=414] There is a fountain filled with blood, drawn from Immanuel's veins, and sin that's
[time=437] launched beneath the flood, who's all that counts and stands, who's all that counts and
[time=452] stands, who's all that counts and stands, who's all that counts and stands, who's all that
[time=452] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 384 seconds] stands, who's all that counts and stands, who's all that counts and stands, who's all that...
[time=865] and Jesus made it all, it all to him I owe, yes, sin had left her crimson stain, he washed
[time=882] her so, oh, nothing could have I, whereby thy grace to cling, I want to be the one that's
[time=912] washed my garments wide in the blood of Calvary's land and when before the throne I stand in
[time=926] complete and Jesus died my soul to save my lips shall still repeat and Jesus made it
[time=943] all to him I owe, and sin had left her crimson stain, he washed her so, oh, nothing could
[time=953] have left her so, oh, nothing could have left her so, oh, nothing could have left her so
[time=959] I owe, and sin had left her so, oh, nothing could have left her so, oh, nothing could have
[time=983] left her so, oh, nothing could have left her so, oh, nothing could have left her so, oh,
[time=1000] nothing could have Jesus made it all to him I owe, and sin had left her crimson stain,
[time=1017] he washed her so, oh, nothing could have left her so, oh, nothing could have left her so,
[time=1026] this passage in Romans 12 verses 9 to 21 I believe this is our seventh message as we
[time=1035] have kind of just taken some time here to kind of work our way through this passage, this passage as many of you know we've talked about it for weeks now it describes for us
[time=1046] it kind of paints a picture if you will in a very powerful way of what transformed living
[time=1052] looks like transformed living in Romans 12 to it says that he doesn't want you to be
[time=1058] conformed any longer to the ways of this world he wants you and I instead to be transformed
[time=1064] he wants our external expressions, our choices, our attitudes to be consistent with the spiritual
[time=1072] reality he wants it to align external expressions with the internal reality of a saved and redeemed
[time=1080] and changed life and so we have over the last several weeks been looking at this passage just kind of going phrase by phrase by phrase and seeing what God has for us there I was
[time=1093] talking with Corbin our worship pastor a couple weeks ago and he was reminding me that earlier
[time=1100] I think couple years ago maybe in his journey he had even at one point committed verses nine to twenty one to memory and as we talked that day I thought and I think I even mentioned to him I thought man what a great what a great idea what just another way to kind of take
[time=1116] this truth and hopefully further embed it further instill it and deposit this truth into
[time=1122] our hearts and lives and I thought you know what I'm going to say something to the family about that so you are all invited you're not assigned we don't we don't do things by
[time=1132] mandate around here on this on this front but I'm just inviting all of you I really am I would love to invite each and every one of you over the next two weeks to memorize
[time=1143] with me okay there I said it so I'm so I'm gonna do it and I would invite you to memorize
[time=1151] to take nine to twenty one and just each day each morning each maybe you know carve out sometime in the middle of the day do some stuff at night with it but to memorize it's about twenty five statements kind of packaged together and hopefully because of our time in it together maybe it's a little bit more familiar to you but what do you say give it some thought if you're in maybe let me know shoot me an email give me a pull me aside in the hallway flag me down it'd be great to have the accountability and we'll memorize it together and how it is will be tested on it I don't know I haven't thought that far yet I know that shocks you but I'll give it some thought and we'll figure out how we might could just share our learnings together more importantly than you reciting it I would just love for you to give yourself to the process I'm reminded of what it says in Psalm
[time=1196] Psalm 119 I want you to see this this morning I want you to be reminded why would I invite
[time=1202] this entire family to memorize a portion of Scripture I love what God's word has to say
[time=1210] about God's word and if you didn't know this already Psalm 119 the entire chapter is about
[time=1216] the word of God and I want you to see what it says in Psalm 119 verse 9 in Psalm 119 verse
[time=1225] 9 it says this how can a young man keep his way pure how can a young woman keep her way
[time=1231] pure how can a mother how can a father how can anybody keep their way pure my friends
[time=1240] by keeping it according to your what say it your word with all my heart I have sought
[time=1246] you the Psalmist says do not let me wander from your commandments from your word your word I have treasured some translations might read your word have I hid in my heart that
[time=1257] I you see it there that I may not sin against you blessed are you oh Lord teach me your statutes
[time=1264] with my lips I have told of all the ordinances of your mouth I have rejoiced in the way of
[time=1270] your testimonies as much as in all riches I will meditate on your precepts your word
[time=1277] and regard your ways I shall delight in your statutes in your word I shall not forget your
[time=1285] what it says when you and I treasure that truth in our hearts it moves you and I toward
[time=1293] a posture where whereby the choice away from sin becomes more natural more accessible more
[time=1302] an expression of who you are and where your heart is and so I would invite you to memorize
[time=1308] verses 9 to 21 will have a great time and I believe God will honor that effort as we give ourselves to it together hey we find ourselves in the third section of 9 to 21 I
[time=1320] told you at the beginning it breaks down into three sections transform living big picture first section verse 9 transform living personally personally remember that hate what is evil
[time=1333] cling to what is good have your love be sincere personally there's some ways that that transformed
[time=1339] a heart can kind of flesh itself out secondly we saw that in verses 10 through 13 there was
[time=1345] a real clear real specific way in which he calls us to live out this transformed heart in relationship with others in biblical community there is a way that we can live out this transformation
[time=1357] of our hearts and now thirdly we've come to this section verses 14 through 16 and now
[time=1363] we've gone from the personal expression of it to the biblical community expression of
[time=1369] it now thirdly as it relates to all people those far from God those in the family of
[time=1375] God anyone and everyone you and I may come in contact with there's a way that we are
[time=1381] to respond there is a way that we can relate there is a way that our transformed hearts can evidence themselves as it relates to all people in honor of God's word would you
[time=1393] stay on this morning and can I read for us verses 14 through 16 we began here last week
[time=1401] it says in verse 14 bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse rejoice with those
[time=1408] who rejoice and weep with those who weep be of the same mind toward one another do not
[time=1415] be haughty in mind but associate with the lowly do not be wise in your own estimation
[time=1423] let me pray for us father God we stand here before you again in humility and with anticipation
[time=1432] and God with hope that as we stand before you that your word and your spirit would do
[time=1438] what only they can do God every person in this room this morning needs a reminder needs
[time=1445] a new learning God every person in this room regardless of where we may be today we need
[time=1452] the hope and the strength and the direction and the support and the truth that only your word provides and we are so grateful that we have the privilege of reading it and studying
[time=1464] it and discussing it and so as we do so today God we pray that you would be honored that
[time=1470] our endeavor here would make much of you and God that you would in your graciousness and
[time=1476] in your loving kindness that you would bestow upon us the blessing and the encouragement
[time=1482] that comes from being exposed to this life changing truth we pray that and we hope for
[time=1488] that in your son's name amen you can be seated hey I want to mention this to you just briefly
[time=1495] before we jump into our passage or before we come back to this fourteen through sixteen passage why is it somebody asked me recently I think they sensed how how much how how deeply
[time=1511] in me I want for you all to to get this they asked me what it was as I look through the
[time=1519] passage as I looked at this transformed living study you know what what was it about the
[time=1525] study that moved my heart that stirred me deeply what was it that I was wanting so badly
[time=1531] for all of you to get and to catch and I think as I think about that this morning I want to just say this to you when I look at the context here of Romans 12 and I I'm so amazed
[time=1542] by and so grateful for what he spells out for us in nine to twenty one and I've been taking
[time=1550] you back you know to verse two I think every week I've stood here I've said to you that
[time=1557] he wants you to be transformed not conformed right and six seven eight weeks of study you
[time=1565] know all the preaching all the explanation all the work all the effort and if you're asking me why is it so important to me that each of you would at some level get this and
[time=1577] not just get it but apply it that I want to take you back to a verse we haven't talked much about and that is verse three I want you to look at Romans 12 three in two he says
[time=1587] don't be conformed by the to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind excuse me not three but the end of two here it is you guys right here so that so that
[time=1598] you may prove what the will of God is that which is good and acceptable and perfect here
[time=1608] you go I want for you whoever you are in this room wherever your journey has you I want
[time=1616] for you God's will I want that for you I pray that for you I long for you as a as a family
[time=1626] I long for you as a couple I long for you as an individual I long for you as a young man in this room I long for you as a young woman here today any of you in this room I
[time=1638] would want for you the capacity and the ability to know what the will of God is for you and
[time=1646] that doesn't happen in your life or mine unless I am transformed by the renewing it
[time=1654] says it right there by the renewing of your mind and as he transforms me here's what
[time=1660] my life begins to look like and when your life begins to look like this we begin to see and understand more clearly what the will of God is for you and I hope that for
[time=1672] you and I pray that for you and that's why I've tried we've tried our best to paint this
[time=1678] picture and will continue this morning to do our best to paint it for you verses 14 through
[time=1684] 16 transformed living as it relates to all people number one don't be look at what it
[time=1690] says there in verse 14 excuse me verse 16 be of the same you see it there be of the same mind toward one another be of the same mind toward one another this speaks to the issue
[time=1703] my friends of partiality this speaks to the issue of distinctions being made in the body
[time=1711] of Christ and what we see here is that in transformed living we will not be partial toward
[time=1717] others we will be impartial we will be of the same mind let me explain this for you let
[time=1725] me let me illustrate this for you in the most powerful clear way that I that I could and that would be through the scriptures themselves go back to James would you go back toward the toward the end of your New Testament Hebrews James James chapter two everybody turn there
[time=1742] if you don't have a Bible and you want to look on with someone next to you I'm sure they'd love to have you do that I think it'll be on the screen as well James chapter two verses
[time=1751] one to four God saw fit to give us this truth here in the second chapter of James and it
[time=1759] speaks to this issue of partiality my brethren it says do not hold your faith in our glorious
[time=1767] Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism for if a man comes into your assembly
[time=1775] with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes and there also comes in a poor man in dirty
[time=1781] clothes and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes and say
[time=1787] you rich guy well dressed guy hey you sit here in a good place and then you say to the poor
[time=1797] man you stand over there or sit down by my footstool see this is not good verse four
[time=1805] have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil motives verse
[time=1814] nine here's where he spells it out but if you show partiality you are committing what
[time=1820] say it out loud I'm gonna have you say that out loud again if you in any way shape or
[time=1829] form my friends if you are I in any way speak or treat or act or think or conduct ourselves
[time=1842] in a way that would that would make a distinction between him and him if we do anything to draw
[time=1852] lines and and create different arenas if we show partiality toward people we are it says
[time=1861] in verse nine committing a what say it sin you are sinning you are violating God you
[time=1869] are violating the hearting character of God you are violating that individual and you are violating the body of Christ but if you show partiality you are committing sin and
[time=1881] are convicted by the law as transgressors and we and we do it a lot there's a part of
[time=1895] me this morning as I stand here before you I can look you in the eye and I can honestly before God say that I feel as if and I sense as if maybe we're doing it less and maybe
[time=1906] we're making some progress maybe he's making some progress in us on this front but we still
[time=1913] do it we do it with race still all the progress that that God has made in us on the race front
[time=1924] but we still we still do it and you and I still need to grow as it relates to the red yellow
[time=1936] black white and brown thing there's just a lot of progress that we can make in our and
[time=1943] I'm not so much talking about programs I'm talking about what I believe God's talking about here and that is your heart your willingness and your openness to embrace to love to come
[time=1955] alongside to be connected with to befriend don't be partial don't say you're over here
[time=1965] and you're over here in my eyes or in my mind or in my heart we do it with race you know what we do it with the poor we do it with the rich the whole rich and poor thing that James just talked about we do it there we treat some of them this way and we treat some of
[time=1981] them that way and the ground at the foot of the cross is level and yet we sometimes want
[time=1992] to come to that cross and bring platforms and stages and we start putting people up and
[time=1999] we start putting some people down we do it with race we do it with the poor and the rich on the socio economic front you know what's really sad is that sometimes we do it with
[time=2012] those far from God the the very people and the very place I mean the very community that
[time=2021] by virtue of God's design is to be a safe haven for the broken and for the hurting and
[time=2028] for the dirty and for the muddied and for the struggling and for the addicted for the bro for the very place and the very people who by virtue of God's design are to be the the
[time=2040] folks that would embrace them sometimes shun them when a real sinner shows up and you and
[time=2051] I have got to be so very careful are we to exercise wisdom in all of those circumstances
[time=2059] absolutely but sometimes our exercising of wisdom I think surpasses our willingness in
[time=2067] our hearts to be a place where folks can come to be a people where folks can connect the
[time=2074] nice neat and tidy ones and the really really hurting ones now why is this so important
[time=2086] why would it be so important that you and I as followers of Christ conduct ourselves
[time=2092] in a way that would be free of partiality well look at Romans chapter two and go just
[time=2098] back a few pages to Romans chapter two says in Romans chapter two verse nine why would
[time=2108] it be so important that you and I would in this family here not exercise this the sense
[time=2114] of partiality why should we remove the distinctions why should we be so open and ready to connect
[time=2120] with and encourage whoever it is that God may bring your way it says there will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil of the Jew first and also of the Greek
[time=2132] but glory verse ten and honor and peace to everyone who does good to the Jew first and
[time=2138] also to the Greek for there is no say it out loud there is no partiality with who with
[time=2148] God who who doesn't who won't he save who wouldn't he extend a hand to what what broken
[time=2165] life wouldn't he be willing to put back together what hurting soul won't he comfort answer
[time=2174] none neither should we this posture in your heart in my heart this posture of the body
[time=2185] of Christ is to be a posture marked by impartial impartial love no divisions no distinctions
[time=2194] welcome let us do what we can secondly I want you to notice here very related I know the
[time=2204] passage back in Romans 12 16 passage continues the verse goes on don't be haughty you see it there don't be haughty be of the same mind no divisions no distinctions don't be haughty
[time=2218] in mind but associate with the lowly it's the next thing I want you to write down there
[time=2224] associate with the lowly haughty in mind in the Greek if you were to look at that phrase
[time=2231] and just try and bring some definition to that thought from the original text the Greek Aramaic text here's what you'd find haughty in mind it says to be consumed with the high
[time=2243] and impressive it's when you all right says don't be this way don't be haughty in mind it's when you or I get overly focused on things not high spiritually but things that
[time=2254] are high materialistically things that might be high in a prideful sense things that are
[time=2261] high in an impressive sense things that are high in an earthly sense when you and I get
[time=2269] caught up when you and I get consumed by the high and impressive things of this place
[time=2278] then we've lost something we've gone some place that you never wanted us to go don't
[time=2285] be haughty in mind the point here is simple and powerful and you know what my friends
[time=2293] sadly oftentimes disregarded in the church today the point is this there is to be no
[time=2300] aristocracy in the church there should be none no aristocracy in the church no place
[time=2309] for a special elite upper crust of individuals in the church there is no room for a good seat
[time=2317] bad seat mentality there's no first class there's no coach there's no business try me
[time=2326] there's no distinctions there shouldn't be a sense where somebody gets a better meal
[time=2333] than you do and yet many times that's what it's come to our Lord spoke to this Jesus
[time=2342] Himself addresses this very issue look at Luke 14 Matthew Mark Luke John go back into the
[time=2349] Gospels it says in Luke 14 verse 12 Luke 14 12 and he Jesus also went on to say see
[time=2363] this guy had invited him to a meal and he goes on to say to the one who had invited him when you give a luncheon or a dinner do not invite your friends or your brothers
[time=2375] or your relatives or rich neighbors otherwise they may also invite you in return and that
[time=2382] will be your repayment but when you give a reception invite the poor invite the crippled
[time=2388] invite the lame the blind and you will be blessed since they do not have the means to
[time=2394] repay you for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous now don't miss this because
[time=2402] I do not believe for a moment that in some way somehow here Jesus is condemning you or
[time=2408] I saying that it's unspiritual or wrong to invite your brother or your sister or your family or some friends or a wealthy individual to your house he's not addressing here the
[time=2420] invitation itself but he is addressing the motive behind it and the motive behind those
[time=2428] kinds of invitations can at times get a little skewed the sinfulness comes when the invitation
[time=2436] is self-serving and that sinful motive is magnified when it ignores when the invitation
[time=2445] ignores those who have nothing no wealth no prominence no influence when do you eat with
[time=2453] them when do you have a party for them when did those invitations go out for the needy
[time=2467] for the hungry for the cold I bet there were some cold people this morning how do you carry
[time=2483] yourself with the handicapped how do you treat or speak to the unlovely what do they say
[time=2495] more importantly what does God say or know to be true about you and the way you conduct
[time=2501] yourself with the haves and the have-nots do you treat or approach a poor person or a
[time=2509] recovering addict the same way you would a rich talented friend do you greet the dirty
[time=2517] or disheveled as warmly as you do the guy in the suit and tie you see the individual who
[time=2524] has no way to repay or reciprocate should be just as important to you just as valuable
[time=2530] and just as embraced as anyone else it's who you're to be it's the way we're to respond
[time=2539] it is the lens through which we are to view the people that God brings across your path
[time=2548] you know what as a boy growing up even real like real early on I don't know how far back
[time=2557] you can remember if I try I can go back a ways and I'm telling you this morning that
[time=2563] as a really young boy and then even as I kind of grew up you know on through the formative
[time=2570] years growing up I noticed something very very interesting to me it was interesting to
[time=2577] me as a little boy and it was very impactful my mom talked to everyone
[time=2597] everywhere we went she talked to people she identified folks she acknowledged people
[time=2608] wherever we went it could have been the drug store the gas station the grocery store it could have been the guy on the street everywhere we went I noticed that my mom talked to everyone
[time=2621] he hugged everybody that got a little irritating at times but I learned as I watched her give
[time=2631] herself to people she pursued people and she embraced anybody there would be times as a
[time=2639] young boy where I'd see her in a circumstance and I think to myself oh my gosh she's gonna hug him she's not gonna hug him and I'd watch her right before my eyes and just boom
[time=2651] she'd hug him she was never thrown off or set back by anyone's race physical parents
[time=2665] prominence or the lack thereof and she modeled for me from the day I can remember that all
[time=2672] people red yellow black white educated uneducated white collar blue collar men women children
[time=2682] young people old people lovely and unlovely easy to be with or extremely complicated that
[time=2694] all people were extremely unique and special not just in the eyes of God but in the heart
[time=2701] of God she was never consumed with the upper class she wasn't overly consumed with the
[time=2708] lower she was incredibly consumed with people period and it's only you know how it is you
[time=2719] get a little older and you look back and you realize what a profound influence somebody had on your life and how God used them to shape you and who you are and people say to
[time=2729] me wow you're you're so nice and you're friendly I say you know what you should have met my mom and Jesus my friends I'm thankful for my mom I'm even more grateful for the example
[time=2742] that our Lord leaves us and I would just encourage you this morning to think about Jesus for
[time=2748] a moment he stopped and embraced the poor and the sick and the diseased again and again
[time=2754] we see him throughout the gospels rubbing shoulders with coming up close to touching
[time=2760] being with embracing praying for the dirtiest of them all the sickest of them all the most
[time=2767] diseased and then we see him taking time to be with the rich young ruler we see him making
[time=2776] opportunity at night late one night it says a wealthy Pharisee named Nicodemus comes to him and I want that for you I want that for you individually I want you to be a follower
[time=2789] of Christ who would begin to more and more so move in and throughout this this world that God has put you in your world the sphere of influence that God has strategically and providentially placed you in I would love to see you because if you're growing understanding of this move more and more so into your everyday minus the distinctions and minus the pride
[time=2812] and minus the platforms with a heart that's ready and willing to not only think a certain
[time=2819] way but actually physically be with and embrace and I want that for our family here I want
[time=2828] Blackhawk to be in a good way in an appropriate way I want us to be known for being a place
[time=2835] a safe place for people to come and hear a life-changing message a safe place because
[time=2843] this place is full of folks who haven't forgotten what it's like to be on the outside looking in and we're ready and we're willing out there and in here to extend the hand to whoever
[time=2855] might need one and whatever way they might need one to whatever extent God may lead
[time=2861] us to extended amen don't be wise last point don't be wise go back to Romans 12 16 third
[time=2869] point here in this one verse don't be wise in your own estimation he says now this makes
[time=2878] sense doesn't it I mean think about it what would keep you or me from embracing the poor or hugging the handicapped or sharing a meal with the unlovely what is it that would keep us from that well what would keep you and I and what keeps you and I from that is there's
[time=2894] times where we're haughty in our mind we're proud we're obsessed with the high things
[time=2901] we get to places in our in our patterns of living and thinking where we see maybe ourselves
[time=2907] as above or superior to those in need and that is absolutely antithetical to what God had
[time=2913] in mind being wise in your own estimation in the Greek when you break that down it's basically
[time=2919] called self-conceit self-promotion self-elevation and yet we've seen and we've learned here
[time=2928] in this family you and I together my friends over recent days even in the last six months we've given ourselves to a to a significant amount of study and discussion study and discussion
[time=2940] that has led us to the realization that the biblical posture of biblical Christianity
[time=2946] is how low can I what go how far down can I posture myself in a sense in subservience
[time=2958] and in humility before God how low can I go not how high can I get how can I serve how
[time=2966] can I sacrifice how can I give how can I take all that God has done in me and all that God
[time=2972] is doing around me and somehow someway by the grace and strength of God provide ministry and encouragement to any and all that might have need how humble how others consumed can
[time=2987] I be these are the things that we've learned following Christ is built on the foundational
[time=2994] truth that life is not about who is not about me it is about him and others and the amazing
[time=3004] life changing opportunities he gives me with them when I'm willing to see and live life
[time=3010] from that perspective let me say this too look at that verse again look at the end of 16 do not be
[time=3018] wise in your own estimation while the previous two points that we looked at in this verse speak
[time=3027] to the fact that there's no room at all for socio-economic divisions if you will in the body of Christ and we also talked about race we talked about those far from God as well because those divisions
[time=3039] do exist at times the wording here in this verse the wording here at the end of 16 my friends
[time=3046] don't be wise speaks to another type yet another type of division that I sometimes see occurring
[time=3053] and and this this fourth area of division that I see sometimes springing up even in our own family
[time=3063] here not to mention the church at large would this would be this division kind of this faction
[time=3070] filled with people who think that they're really really wise they know a lot they're really smart
[time=3078] spiritually they're very well read they're very knowledgeable they've read this a lot
[time=3086] and all the books that came with it and they've been to all the seminars and they've they've
[time=3092] studied all the stuff and they can kind of talk that language and there's times where your pursuit
[time=3098] or mind even of knowledge leads us to be wise in our own estimation
[time=3104] and he says to you and he says to me this morning no no no no he says don't go there
[time=3110] intellectual spiritual intellectual division look at how much I know
[time=3118] let me say this to you this morning it's pretty important that you hear this
[time=3126] I believe with all of my heart that you should know the word of God you should know the word of God
[time=3134] you should study it privately and you should study it corporately in the gathering you should
[time=3140] meditate on it my friends you should memorize it chapter 12 verses 9 to 21 here we go you should
[time=3147] meditate on it you should memorize it you should sing it you should listen to it and you should pray it you should be consumed with the word as it permeates each and every arena of your life
[time=3159] you should know it you should pass it on to your family you should explain it to your children you just shouldn't act like you know it let me explain that to you maybe you sensed what I meant
[time=3173] as I said it because there are people who know it and they act like they know it
[time=3180] and I think that's dangerous I think he wants you to act humbly I think he wants your knowledge
[time=3188] of it to spurn you on to love and good deeds I think your knowledge of the word of God
[time=3195] should propel you to greater acts of love and kindness love toward him and kindness toward others
[time=3204] your knowledge of this truth should enhance your love of him and you're embracing of them
[time=3211] now I've met some really really smart people I've met some really wise people in my life
[time=3219] and you know what sad to say it's been a rare thing an inspiring thing but a rare thing
[time=3228] when I've sensed the smart guy or gal wanting me to feel loved rather than impressed
[time=3235] and with all that you know and with all that you've gained and gleaned and with all that's been
[time=3243] built into your mind over these years make sure that when you speak it and make sure that when
[time=3249] you pass it on and make sure that when you live it that what they're sensing is your desire to love
[time=3257] them not impress them because God's words really really really clear
[time=3264] about you and I or well I wouldn't throw myself in that category but there are some who are really
[time=3272] really smart and really really bright but see God's word even has a way of bringing all that into perspective listen to this first Corinthians 1-26
[time=3283] for consider your calling brethren that there were not many wise according to the flesh not many
[time=3290] mighty not many noble but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise and God
[time=3298] has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen and the base things of the world and the despised God has
[time=3311] chosen the things that are not so that he may nullify the things that are so that no here you go so that no man may boast before God and that is my hope for you this morning that in one verse
[time=3329] you would see these three things and that you would again this morning be reminded that it is humility
[time=3336] that he longs for and transformed living will show itself when you are ready in the relationships
[time=3344] that that you live in on the everyday with those he brings across your path with all people far from
[time=3350] God and those in the family that you would be willing to view them without distinction that you
[time=3356] would be willing to remove the haughty stuff the proud stuff that you would associate with the lowly
[time=3362] as readily as you would with the advanced or the the achieved and that in the end you would be so
[time=3369] very careful with the wisdom that he's given you with the things that you're learning I sure hope
[time=3375] that they'll feel loved by you I sure hope that they'll feel served by you and not impressed why
[time=3384] don't you stand with me this morning why don't you bow your heads as you do so father God we
[time=3393] stand before you this morning maybe many in the room willing in the days to come to commit to memory to hide in our hearts your life-changing truth God I pray that you would give us the courage
[time=3405] and the strength to do so maybe even the willingness to sell to tell someone else to share that with
[time=3412] somebody so that we can be encouraged and held accountable oh God I pray that we would be people
[time=3419] who in a relationship with you would begin to evidence more and more so God these these three principles that we've seen this morning I'm reminded of what it says in a in a different
[time=3432] translation God somebody passed this to me this morning in a different translation verse 16 somewhere
[time=3441] in there it says don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people and Father God we are so grateful that Jesus was one who seemed so willing to be with the ordinary
[time=3455] people and I pray God that we would out of a love for you and a desire to serve you and represent
[time=3462] you well God I pray that we would remove ourselves more and more so from the distinctions that can
[time=3469] exist God I pray that we would love and and see the way you love and see God we pray that your
[time=3476] lens the lens through which you view all race and all socioeconomic positions God the lens through
[time=3484] which you view this whole world God that that would in time be more and more the lens through which we exist each day and see God I pray that we would be a people transformed in the way that
[time=3496] we relate and communicate to all when it's easy and when it's challenging thank you for the
[time=3503] examples that you've given us each of us in this room could probably speak to situations where
[time=3509] people have lived this out and encouraged us in the process thank you for them and may we be a people God who could leave that kind of embracing loving serving legacy to others may we be humble
[time=3523] may we serve with hearts completely devoted to you and your son's name we pray and they all
[time=3529] agreed and said amen
[time=3559] [MUSIC]
[time=3589] you
