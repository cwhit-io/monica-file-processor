[time=88] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=91] And I want to just tell you how thankful I am for the opportunity that God's given us these last eight weeks.
[time=98] I say this to you time and time again, but as I watch him do what he does,
[time=104] as I watch him move in ways that we didn't expect when I see God come alongside an effort and do something really special with it.
[time=113] It just amazes me.
[time=115] And he does that in so many different ways.
[time=117] He does it in a thousand different settings with efforts that you make and efforts that I make that left to themselves wouldn't do or accomplish anything.
[time=127] But when he brings his touch to it, when the Spirit of God and the Word of God come alongside the things that we give ourselves to,
[time=136] that's when it gets really, really exciting.
[time=138] And what we've done here at Blackhawk these eight weeks, what began with just a desire that God put in my heart to take some time and go through Romans 12 verses 9 to 21.
[time=151] There was just something in me that felt like we should look at that, that we should give some time to that passage.
[time=157] This passage there that talks about or better yet kind of describes for you and I what it looks like to live a transformed life.
[time=167] And as we began eight weeks ago and we began to spend week after week after week after week diving into the text and finding there these great truths
[time=179] and these great applications for everyday life that has just been an amazing journey.
[time=185] So many of you have written in, so many of you have made comments, the family here at Blackhawk, the response has been enormous and we're so grateful for what God has done with this Romans 12, 9 to 21, transformed living study.
[time=202] What you're going to see today is the final installment of this study. It has been so exciting to see God continue to transform us.
[time=210] He has continued to change and grow me. He has continued to change and transform and grow so many people who have given themselves to this study and you'll find today the last part.
[time=222] We come to verses 17 through 21 and a very difficult component, a very difficult part of the study. It's talking about how to live a transformed life with those that don't like you, with your enemy, with those who for some reason are out to get you.
[time=239] And I know that in your life as well as in my life there are instances, there are times, there are situations, there are relationships that we find ourselves in with people who just seem to have it out for us.
[time=250] And God's Word says here in this passage that there's a way you and I are to respond. There is a mindset. There is a heart that we are to have.
[time=259] And as we make our way through today's passage, I hope you'll be willing and courageous enough to listen to what God's Word says.
[time=268] One last thing before I let you go, a couple of weeks ago I said to our family here at Blackhawk and I wanted to just reiterate to you as well.
[time=276] I said hey everybody why don't you just along with me commit this passage to memory.
[time=282] I don't know how many of you in the viewing audience have ever exercised the spiritual discipline of memorizing the Scriptures.
[time=291] You may do that on a regular basis or maybe it's something you've never tried before, but I just want to specifically invite you, those of you in the viewing audience.
[time=300] Would you be willing over the next week or so to take these verses, verses 9 to 21 right there in Romans 12 and how about if you in the viewing audience along with, at this point I think we're up to a couple to 300 people here in the Blackhawk family who have committed to hide God's Word in their heart to memorize Romans 12, 9 to 21.
[time=322] So how about you join us and I'd love for you to let me know how about some accountability. I'll pray for you, I'll shoot you a line back, email me at the address here on the screen and let me know that you're willing in your effort to live a transformed life.
[time=337] You're willing to commit these verses that we've been studying these last eight weeks to memory. I'd love to have you join us, tell me, write me, shoot me a note and tell me you're in and we'll pray for you and we'll lift you up in that endeavor.
[time=351] I'm so thankful for you, so thankful that you tune in week after week and I hope that these messages transformed living, Romans 12, I hope that you'll allow them to make a difference, not only now but in the days to come.
[time=365] You can get all of those messages online, you can download them for your iPod, you can order DVDs, you can get the CDs, just call us at the church office, the numbers right here on the screen, they can tell you how to get that done or you can visit our website.
[time=380] Thank you so much for tuning in, God bless you and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=388] [MUSIC]
[time=418] And holding back the flood was just like holding back the tide. I couldn't help but circulate to everyone I know.
[time=432] I will spread this talk all over town about the peace and joy I've found in you to lose good news.
[time=444] The story is about to break and bless it all the feet to take the truth, the good news, the good news.
[time=454] If you hold my dance and choose, I've got good news.
[time=462] I've got good news, I'll spread this talk all over town about the peace and joy I've found in you to lose good news.
[time=476] The story is about to break and bless it all the feet to take the truth, the good news, the good news.
[time=486] I'm slipping on my dance and choose, I've got good news.
[time=522] [MUSIC]
[time=544] [APPLAUSE]
[time=547] Hey, I also want to just mention this to you.
[time=549] I know there are many of you in our family, many of you who have personally been impacted by,
[time=557] been impacted by or you've benefited from the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=561] I know as I hear story after story after story of folks who are a part of this family,
[time=567] I know that you've seen God use the Bible hour to touch your life.
[time=572] You maybe are here today because one morning five, ten years ago you woke up and God did something kind of special there in that living room.
[time=579] Maybe you have family or friends who have been impacted by it again and again and again we hear the stories of people who tune in on Sunday morning at seven o'clock and they watch the body gather and it's an amazing thing what God does.
[time=594] Recently, actually several months ago, Eric Hall, as he kind of did some things with our website,
[time=600] was able to put on our website a Bible hour survey opportunity.
[time=603] It was a chance for people who watch the Bible hour to respond.
[time=606] It was an opportunity for me to go on air and invite those who watch on a regular basis
[time=612] to just take a few minutes and share with us what their experience has been like, what the Bible hour has meant to them.
[time=618] And I just thought as we continue to get these responses in from people.
[time=623] I was just wanting to just take a few minutes today and just share a few of the things that have come in recently.
[time=628] It's so encouraging.
[time=629] Some of these things as I read them thrill my soul, some of them absolutely break my heart.
[time=635] And I read these to you today just to give you an ongoing sense of those who are out there,
[time=642] those who listen, those who get up on Sunday morning and watch at seven o'clock
[time=648] or they tape it and they come from every walk of life and they represent different stages
[time=656] of life, spiritual life and personal life.
[time=659] Listen to some of the things that they've shared.
[time=662] I went through a horrible divorce, one person writes.
[time=666] I went through a horrible divorce after 22 years of marriage and knew that God was my only answer but could not walk into a church without crying.
[time=675] Then I found the Bible hour.
[time=678] Another person writes, "My husband didn't want me to go to church because we had some bad experiences with two other churches." Then I learned that my father watched the Bible hour on a regular basis so I decided to try
[time=691] and watch it on a regular basis with the hope of maybe finding a church that I could really relate to.
[time=697] Wow.
[time=698] What I have found in your broadcast, I hope someday to visit the church
[time=704] for now my husband won't consider it, but I keep hoping.
[time=709] Another one writes in, "I was confined at home one winter while taking chemo and found you." Another one says, "I wanted to kill myself." Then God woke me up to the Bible hour one morning.
[time=728] One says, "I was committed to my home church but my spirit wasn't being fed and I was searching for some answers.
[time=734] I found those in the Bible hour.
[time=736] I came to realize that I needed to stay at the church.
[time=739] I was at for a reason.
[time=741] I made that clear but I also knew I needed to grow and learn and God led me to you." Now I know that sounds funny but it's true.
[time=749] I watch the Bible hour every Sunday morning as I'm getting dressed to go and serve in my church.
[time=757] One respondent said this, "I grew up in the church and I missed the family connection.
[time=762] My son and I go to different churches once in a while but cannot make a connection because we cannot invite anyone to our home.
[time=770] It is hard to reach out to other people when you know you are a person that most people would not want to associate with.
[time=778] I've noticed in most churches if you're not outgoing or physically attractive, you are overlooked and it's hard to be rejected over and over and over again.
[time=789] Attending church at home is safer.
[time=794] I went to one of the Christmas with Blackhawk programs, this individual rights.
[time=800] I went to a CWB program there and really liked it and I was told about the Bible hour and began to watch.
[time=807] Now I attend on a regular basis.
[time=810] This last one says, "I watch every Sunday morning because I need more understanding of God to feel that maybe I might be worth something." So there you have it, just a reminder to every one of us that there are so many people
[time=825] who watch from so many walks of life who find themselves in so many different situations and you and I have been blessed, privileged to be able to offer them something like this.
[time=835] And I hope that you'll continue to partner with this.
[time=838] I hope you'll continue to support the Bible hour.
[time=840] I hope you'll remember to encourage your friends to tune in.
[time=844] For many people it is a great first step and so keep that in mind and be so very thankful for what God's doing.
[time=851] Hey, why don't you open your Bibles to Romans 12?
[time=854] Let's go back to Romans 12.
[time=857] We come back now for the 8th part, the final installment of this series that we have entitled
[time=864] Transformed Living.
[time=866] Transformed Living, Romans chapter 12 verses 9 to 21.
[time=870] I've got to say this, I'm really, really thankful for the response that so many of you have given.
[time=875] Last week I stood here.
[time=877] If you were here last week, you know, I stood here and I invited everybody in the place to just, if you were up for it, to just maybe think about memorizing Romans 12, 9 to 21.
[time=888] Personally, I'm aware, personally, I'm aware of about 120 to 130 folks from emails or voicemails.
[time=896] I've heard from you and it is so encouraging to hear that there are so many who are willing to come and give themselves to this process of trying to hide God's word in your heart.
[time=906] Raise your hand if you're one who, and maybe you didn't tell me, but now's a chance to be honest.
[time=911] If you've committed to memorize Romans 12, 9 to 21 in the next two weeks, raise your hand.
[time=916] Come on.
[time=917] Everybody up?
[time=918] Oh, come on.
[time=920] There were more of you than that.
[time=922] Okay, if you've memorized verse 9, just the first verse, everybody say it on three.
[time=928] One, two, three.
[time=930] Go.
[time=935] That's good.
[time=937] That's very good.
[time=938] A few different translations go in there.
[time=940] Sound a little bit like tongues for a second.
[time=943] But it was all right.
[time=944] That was good.
[time=945] Let love be without hypocrisy.
[time=947] Abhor, what is evil cling to what is good?
[time=955] In ASB, in IV, no problem.
[time=958] However you're doing that, thank you for jumping in on that.
[time=962] Verses 9 to 21, a great picture as we found over these last eight weeks, a great picture of transformed living.
[time=969] When we began this series, I told you that as we would make our way through verses 9 to 21, we would kind of see it playing out in four different ways.
[time=972] There's kind of four sections, if you will, to this passage.
[time=976] And it's all about transformed living.
[time=978] But as you go through it, you realize that there's transformed living in your personal life.
[time=983] That was the first couple of weeks.
[time=985] There was transformed living in biblical community with others.
[time=988] We came to that couple, two, three weeks into it.
[time=991] Then we went on to transform living with everybody, the way you and I are to respond as Christ followers.
[time=997] In a transformed way with all people that we come in contact with.
[time=1002] And this morning we make our way down to verses 17 through 21.
[time=1007] And in 17 to 21, we're going to see our fourth section, if you will.
[time=1012] It's transformed living with those who are out to get you.
[time=1019] What we're looking at here in this final section is transformed living with an enemy.
[time=1025] This is transformed living with those who, for whatever reason, they just seem to be the kind of individual who's out to get you.
[time=1036] They're trying to make your life miserable.
[time=1039] It seems as if in your interactions with them.
[time=1041] It seems as if in your relationship with them, whatever that relationship might entail.
[time=1045] It just seems as if, for whatever reason, they have it out for you.
[time=1051] And God's Word says even in those circumstances, there is a way that we can respond.
[time=1056] There is a way that we can live.
[time=1058] Transformed living, not conformed.
[time=1061] Back to Romans 12, too.
[time=1063] He says, "Don't be conformed to the patterns of this world." No, I've made you new.
[time=1067] I've redeemed you.
[time=1069] I've saved you.
[time=1070] Now live a transformed life.
[time=1073] When we come to this passage here, the last passage in our look at verses 9 to 21.
[time=1079] And if you would in honor of God's Word, just stand and allow me to read this to you.
[time=1084] Transformed living with those who are out to get you.
[time=1088] It says in verse 17, "Never, never pay back evil for evil to anyone.
[time=1095] Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
[time=1097] If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
[time=1103] Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written,
[time=1109] vengeance is mine.
[time=1110] I will repay," says the Lord, "but if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[time=1115] And if he is thirsty, give him a drink.
[time=1118] For in so doing you will heat burning coals on his head." Verse 21, "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[time=1131] Father, God, we humbly stand before you this morning, and we come again to this passage, God with the same prayer and hope that has been on our heart for weeks.
[time=1140] God, would you please take this truth?
[time=1143] And would you please take our hearts and our lives and the every day of what we face?
[time=1148] And God, would you please continue to transform us?
[time=1152] Would you please continue to change us and grow us and mold us into the people, God, that you've called us to be?
[time=1160] We realize that whatever we might face, whoever we may encounter, whatever attitudes we may
[time=1166] bump up against, whatever circumstances we find ourselves in, Father, God, there is a way that we can respond with a transformed spirit.
[time=1176] So God, make that clear, make it clearer and clearer as we walk this road together.
[time=1182] Thank you so very much for this great truth.
[time=1185] You pray, God, that you would teach it to us, remind us of it today, in new and life-changing
[time=1191] ways.
[time=1192] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1196] You can be seated.
[time=1197] Well, if you've got a pen, just get it out and write this down.
[time=1201] Number one, we're going to just look at three things in this passage this morning.
[time=1204] The first thing I want you to take note of as you attempt to, with the help of God, live a transformed life with those who are out to get you with the enemy, if you will.
[time=1215] The first thing I want you to write down is respectfully avoid paybacks, respectfully
[time=1221] avoid paybacks, right there, verse 17, "Never pay back evil for evil to anyone."
[time=1228] Now it's amazing as you look at our passage because back up in verse 14 it said that we are, to what did it say there, "Bless those who persecute you." We not only are to bless those who persecute us and not curse them as the passage went
[time=1243] on to say, "We are never to move," this passage says, "we are never to move toward
[time=1249] an act of personal revenge." Now there may be some in the audience who might immediately say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute now, Kelly, what about that whole, that Old Testament verse wherever it is that says an "I" for an "I" and a "what" and a "tooth for a tooth." Well, I want you to think about that just for a moment.
[time=1268] The Old Testament law of an "I" for an "I" a "tooth for a tooth," that's Exodus 21, if you want to write that down, Exodus 21, Leviticus 24, this idea that God lays out
[time=1280] in His law there in the Old Testament of an "I" for an "I" this pertained to my friends to civil justice, not personal revenge.
[time=1290] Not only that, but its major purpose was to prevent the severity of punishment from exceeding the severity of the offense.
[time=1298] In other words, someone guilty of destroying another person's "I" could not be punished with any greater penalty than that of forfeiting one of his own "I"s, thus an "I" for an "I."
[time=1311] Now a few verses later, well, the next chapter, we're in Romans 12.
[time=1316] The next chapter, Romans 13, speaks to this as well.
[time=1320] Romans 13, 4, Paul declares that civil authority or government is a, and I quote, "is a minister
[time=1326] of God to you for good, but if you do what is evil, be afraid," it says, "for it does
[time=1333] not bear government, does not bear the sword for nothing, for it is a minister of God and a avenger who brings wrath upon the one who practices evil."
[time=1345] But that very authority, which not only is divinely permitted but divinely mandated for
[time=1351] civil government is divinely forbidden for personal purposes.
[time=1357] Write this down.
[time=1358] First Thessalonians 5, 15.
[time=1362] Paul speaks to this issue again in his letter to the church at Thessalonica.
[time=1366] He says in chapter 5 verse 15, he says, "See that no one repays another with evil for evil,
[time=1373] but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all men."
[time=1379] Thessalonians 5, 15, Peter, in his letters, Peter echoes the same truth in nearly the
[time=1385] same words.
[time=1387] It says in 1 Peter 3, 8 to 9, "to sum up, let all be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly,
[time=1394] kindhearted and humble in spirit, not returning evil for evil or insult for insult."
[time=1403] Stop right there for a second.
[time=1406] So how do you do it that right there?
[time=1410] Why don't you stop?
[time=1411] Just take a minute here.
[time=1412] Let's just do a quick how we doing.
[time=1416] How do you do when an evil has been perpetrated upon you?
[time=1424] How do you do when an insult has come your way?
[time=1430] You weren't asking for it, you weren't looking for it, but somebody for whatever reason chose to say this about you.
[time=1437] They chose to do this to you.
[time=1440] They chose to treat someone you love this way.
[time=1444] An evil has been perpetrated.
[time=1446] It may be minor, it may have been severe.
[time=1448] An insult has been brought against you.
[time=1452] What's your response?
[time=1458] Not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead.
[time=1470] For you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.
[time=1479] You know when I think about this, never pay back evil for evil.
[time=1485] When I think about paybacks, when I think about insult for insult, I'm sorry, I realize
[time=1491] it may again be the stage of life that I'm in, but my mind immediately goes to the hundreds
[time=1498] of trips down the hallway I've taken to the room where the screaming is coming from and
[time=1504] the crying and the yelling and you can tell before you turn the corner into that room World
[time=1510] War III has broken out.
[time=1513] When I come around that corner, how many times have you grandparents or you moms and dads or even brothers and sisters with younger, how many times have you walked in and said what is going on and the first thing you hear is what, he, what, he hit me.
[time=1529] He hit me.
[time=1531] She spit on me.
[time=1536] That goes on your house, doesn't it?
[time=1540] She kicked me.
[time=1543] He spit on me.
[time=1545] She hit me.
[time=1546] He took my toy and it is clear to you and me standing there that whether this kid got
[time=1555] hit, kicked, spit on or toy stolen, he has or she has taken matters into their own hands
[time=1562] and somebody got kicked, hit, spit on or a toy stolen back, right?
[time=1570] Because we're just, you know, we're kids, you know, and when you're four, five, six, seven, eight years old, maybe sometimes nine and ten, you're not going to stand for it.
[time=1578] If you get offended, if you get hit, if you get something ripped off by Golly, you're going
[time=1584] to go back and make it right because that's what little kids do.
[time=1588] Little kids, they fight and they take what's theirs and they want to get even little kids.
[time=1599] Problem is at 43, 52 and 27 and on up the age bracket we can go, we all just keep doing
[time=1617] the same thing and you might not, you might not kick me.
[time=1624] I might not spit on you.
[time=1628] I might not take your toy, no, we've become much more refined and we've become much more
[time=1635] mature in our bickering and our fighting and our getting even and it's just, it's just
[time=1645] not what God had in mind.
[time=1648] In these relationships that He allows us to be in, in this community, this family, God
[time=1654] that He allows you and I to be a part of, He says, "Do not pay back evil for evil."
[time=1663] Don't do it.
[time=1666] You may need to confront, right?
[time=1668] You may need to confront lovingly but as for getting even, as for striking back transformed
[time=1676] living leaves that to who?
[time=1681] Say it louder, God says right here in our passage, verse 19, you can just look right there.
[time=1687] Verse 19, "Never take your own revenge." He just says it differently, "Never take your own revenge, beloved but leave room for the wrath of God for it has written vengeance is mine.
[time=1698] I will repay," says the Lord.
[time=1701] Now, you know and I know that the problem is we can all nod our heads and say, "All right,
[time=1708] all right, all right.
[time=1709] I know God's got it all in control but so many times the way God brings His vengeance
[time=1715] or the timing of God's dealing with it.
[time=1719] You know, so many times it just doesn't match up with what you and I know should have been done.
[time=1726] The way that should have been dealt with, the pain they should have felt, the embarrassment
[time=1732] that they should have gone through." I mean, we wanted them squished because by golly we would have.
[time=1740] That was that a slap on the, that was a squish.
[time=1744] That was a squish.
[time=1746] Vowels down here doing sign language and when I said squish, something got squished.
[time=1753] We want them leveled and God says, "Leave whatever's going to happen to them, whatever
[time=1760] I'm going to do with them, however I'm going to make that right, whatever lesson they're
[time=1766] going to learn, I'll teach it," he says.
[time=1769] I'll administer that lesson and it'll be in my time, in my place, my way.
[time=1776] And you know what my friends?
[time=1778] You've watched this.
[time=1779] I've seen this.
[time=1780] Sometimes that's next week, sometimes it's next month, sometimes it's not, sometimes
[time=1788] it's not till later, but somehow some way at some time God is going to deal with what
[time=1794] God needs and chooses to deal with.
[time=1797] For you and I, we are not to pay back evil for evil.
[time=1807] I guess the application, if you want to write this down, it's not real profound.
[time=1811] I guess the application for you and I on this one is we need to grow up.
[time=1816] We need to stop acting like little kids in a toy room that got a block taken.
[time=1823] And we need to allow God to do what God's going to do.
[time=1827] And then look what it says next.
[time=1828] Write this down.
[time=1829] Respectfully avoid paybacks.
[time=1830] Here's your second point, you, every one of you in this room, be it pea, be peaceful, as it says.
[time=1837] In this ongoing relationship with those who may for whatever reason be out to make life difficult for you, he says that we are to be peaceful and pursue harmony, you.
[time=1850] You, every one of you in this room that knows him, every one of you in this room that claims
[time=1859] the name of Christ and professes to be in this fully surrendered relationship with him,
[time=1865] every one of you in this room, you are to be willing in your heart and ready in your
[time=1872] spirit to be peaceful and to pursue harmony.
[time=1875] What does it say there?
[time=1876] Verse 18, "If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace," it says, "with all men.
[time=1886] Be at peace with all men." Listen, fulfillment of this, this principle, I understand is conditional in that it partly
[time=1896] depends on the attitudes and responses of our enemies.
[time=1903] If possible, Paul says, "so far as it depends on you, be it peace," whether between nations or individuals, listen, whether between, whether between employers, a mean older brother and
[time=1916] yourself, coworkers and you, neighbors and you, other couples and you, difficult relatives
[time=1923] and you, whoever it may be that you find yourself in this struggle with.
[time=1931] Peace is two way.
[time=1932] By definition, a peaceful relationship cannot be one-sided.
[time=1936] Our responsibility, my friend's your responsibility this morning, is to make sure that your side
[time=1943] of that relationship is right, that your spirit, that your heart, that your willingness and
[time=1949] readiness is in place to be in a peaceful, God-honoring relationship, going to whatever lengths you might need to go to, willing to say whatever you might need to say.
[time=1960] Short of compromising, listen, short of compromising God's truth, we should be willing to go to great lengths to build peaceful bridges to those who hate us, to those who harm us, to
[time=1973] those who mistreat us.
[time=1975] We must forsake any grudge of bitterness and fully forgive from the heart, all who harm
[time=1982] us.
[time=1983] Having done that, we can seek reconciliation honestly and fulfill our part of this transformed
[time=1990] approach to conflict.
[time=1992] Let me say this.
[time=1995] Let me say this, you and I should be willing to respond this way in each and every situation where it talks about being willing to forgive from the heart, those who harm us.
[time=2006] I want to say this, if you're being sexually mistreated, if you're being physically abused
[time=2016] by a spouse, by an adult, you should say something, you should speak up and you should
[time=2026] be empowered and encouraged today to understand and know that that is in no way shape or form
[time=2033] part of God's design.
[time=2035] This admonition this morning isn't in some way an admonition for you to stay in a sexually or physically abusive setting.
[time=2043] There are ways in which we can help you, there are ways in which others can help you distance yourself from that.
[time=2051] And there are ways even how, it's amazing how God does this, how God does this.
[time=2055] Even from that distance, there are ways then that God can begin to soften your heart towards
[time=2061] those who have offended.
[time=2064] There needs to be in your heart and mind a willingness to pursue at all costs, peace.
[time=2071] There's also the responsibility on your part in mind to act wisely with discernment.
[time=2077] And if you need help in any of those situations, please let us know.
[time=2082] Here's the point I want to make on this.
[time=2085] If you choose to disobey, if you choose to move away my friends from what God's calling you to here, be peaceful, he says, and pursue harmony.
[time=2093] As far as it depends on you and your heart and mind and soul, be willing to be at peace.
[time=2099] If you don't do that, if you move away from that, my friends, the one place you move
[time=2105] away to is a thing called, is a place called bitterness.
[time=2112] Whatever has happened, whatever they've done, you know, whatever they've said, whatever the conflicts about, if you and I, and believe me, I've been there.
[time=2122] Many of you in this room have been there.
[time=2124] And if you move away from God's design in the midst of that conflict, whatever has transpired,
[time=2131] whatever hurt has taken place, we move away from God's design to a place called bitterness.
[time=2138] It's a place that shrinks your heart.
[time=2142] It's a place that shrivels your soul.
[time=2145] It's a place that hardens every part of you.
[time=2150] I'll never forget years ago now, maybe I had been here maybe a couple of years and I was having this conversation with one of our elders.
[time=2157] He's a good man, a good friend.
[time=2159] Many of you know him.
[time=2160] His name's Dale Siegelen.
[time=2161] And I don't know where Dale got this.
[time=2162] I don't know if it was a Dale quote or something he read, but Dale told me eight years ago, he said, Kelly, don't ever forget, bitterness is like, bitterness is like drinking poison
[time=2174] and waiting for the other person to die.
[time=2177] And I just, I want to personally just, you know, one voice to, is many who will hear
[time=2187] me today.
[time=2188] I just want you to know it's true.
[time=2191] It's like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die and they don't die.
[time=2196] You do.
[time=2198] It tears you up.
[time=2202] And I hope this morning that whatever has transpired, whatever this enemy has perpetrated
[time=2209] upon you, I would hope for you today, I would hope for you the joy and the peace of knowing
[time=2218] what it means to forgive.
[time=2222] The joy and the peace that comes when you're able to deal with those things, to have a heart that's ready to be at peace as far as it depends on you.
[time=2231] And again, you know what, if you need some help with that, I know I have in the past needed help with that.
[time=2237] My hope is that you'll, you'll ask.
[time=2240] Number three, write this down, transform living.
[time=2244] When you live a transformed life, you respectfully avoid payback, you're peaceful and you pursue harmony.
[time=2250] Number three, you overcome evil, you overcome evil with good.
[time=2254] That's what the scriptures teach.
[time=2256] Look at verse 20 back in our passage in Romans 12.
[time=2259] It says, what an amazing two verses.
[time=2262] But if your enemy is what, say it out loud, feed him, and if he is what, give him a drink
[time=2270] for in doing so, you will heat burning coals on his head.
[time=2274] Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[time=2279] This is, this my friends, is an amazing way to wrap this entire passage up.
[time=2285] What the scriptures teach here in these verses.
[time=2287] And what we as Christ followers must see and embrace is that merely not returning evil
[time=2294] for evil, though that's good, right?
[time=2296] We've seen it already in our passage.
[time=2297] It said, never payback evil for evil, it's a good thing.
[time=2301] But what this communicates and where this takes us is that merely not returning evil
[time=2307] for evil doesn't completely fulfill our biblical responsibility with the enemy.
[time=2315] And this is where it gets extremely challenging because to withhold vengeance is one thing.
[time=2321] But then again, think about it, withholding vengeance requires that I do what?
[time=2328] Nothing.
[time=2330] I'm just withholding vengeance.
[time=2333] It requires that I do nothing, but to then actually return good for evil, for my response
[time=2346] to the evil, for my response to the mistreatment, for me to return good for evil, for me to
[time=2352] return gentleness, when I've been treated with harshness, for me to return kindness,
[time=2360] and I've been treated with insensitivity for me or for you to grant grace when I've been
[time=2367] so mistreated.
[time=2370] This is something altogether more complicated and compelling.
[time=2376] And as you think about that this morning, I just want us to be as practical and as honest with ourselves as we can be.
[time=2382] So I'm just going to ask it to you, I'm just going to say it to you this way.
[time=2386] I think it would be a shame for you and I to leave this place this morning having not thought through the realities of our lives, the reality of this last year, the reality of this last month, the reality for you, for me of this last week.
[time=2398] And I want for you the freedom and I want for you the ability to stand in relationship
[time=2404] with him today, with transformed stuff going on.
[time=2408] And so I want to ask you right now, who has wronged you?
[time=2412] Who?
[time=2414] Who said what they shouldn't have said?
[time=2420] Who has been insensitive?
[time=2422] Who has gossiped about you and lied about you?
[time=2427] Who has violated your friendship?
[time=2431] Who has committed some evil against you?
[time=2437] I'm asking and I want you to think about that.
[time=2440] And how have you responded?
[time=2448] How could you today or this week show goodness toward them?
[time=2457] With wisdom in an appropriate way.
[time=2460] How could you evidence kindness toward them?
[time=2464] How could you even serve them possibly?
[time=2471] That was amazing, just to kind of go back, just bear with me here.
[time=2474] Go back to the beginning, go back to Janet, go back to Exodus, second book in the Bible,
[time=2480] go to Exodus 23, this mindset my friends, this approach to conflict, this way of relating
[time=2488] to those who would seemingly be against you, this finds its roots back at the very beginning of God's program.
[time=2495] It says in Exodus 23 verses 4 and 5, this was amazing, just to find this and read through this.
[time=2501] If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey wandering away, now I realize, there's not
[time=2509] a lot of you in the room who are going to come across your enemy's donkey.
[time=2515] We may have a few, I don't know, but here's the point, all right, here's the point.
[time=2522] You've got an enemy, you've got somebody who's got it out for you.
[time=2526] They've been out of line, they've stepped over the edge, they've conducted themselves with you, they've said things, they've done things, they've created this scenario and it's just killing you.
[time=2538] And now by some strange turn of events, all of a sudden you're just walking along, mind
[time=2544] in your own business, and all of a sudden somehow you've got in your hand, let's say,
[time=2550] something that would mean a great deal to them, somehow you've come upon a circumstance where you've got the control and you can now do something or you can now say something
[time=2562] or you can now punch a button, you can pull a string now and that guy or that gal, they're
[time=2569] going to feel it.
[time=2572] Their ox is wandering and you come upon it.
[time=2578] That's donkey and that day, those were things that meant a great deal, I mean their livelihood
[time=2584] is represented by their ox or their donkey and it says you shall surely return it to
[time=2596] him.
[time=2599] You won't do anything, you could have, but you won't do anything to bring harm.
[time=2606] You won't do anything to undermine.
[time=2609] You give him the donkey back and it doesn't say you just slap the donkey and point it
[time=2615] in the right direction, does it?
[time=2617] It says you take it where?
[time=2619] To him, here, here's your donkey.
[time=2625] I found it out on the road, I thought you might want it back, I mean just kind of in your mind just kind of translate that to the conversation of our day, whatever that might
[time=2636] sound like.
[time=2638] If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying helpless under its load, you shall refrain
[time=2647] from leaving it to him, you shall surely release it with him.
[time=2653] Same idea.
[time=2656] How could you today or this week, my friends, show goodness toward them who have mistreated you?
[time=2662] How could you exercise kindness, how could you serve them?
[time=2665] Jesus takes this truth from Exodus 23 and as he always does, he just kind of, he brings
[time=2671] it with his own, his own way, his own style, his own manner, he speaks to it a number of places in the New Testament.
[time=2677] Look at Matthew 5 and the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5, 6 and 7, those three chapters together
[time=2683] forming yet another amazing picture of transformed living in Matthew 5, 44, there you see it.
[time=2690] But I say to you, love your enemies and you know what, this might be the hardest one of
[time=2696] them all.
[time=2697] What does it say, pray, pray for, pray for those who persecute you.
[time=2705] And I'll leave you this morning, I'm going to leave you with a couple things.
[time=2709] One is that right there, I would encourage you, I'm not challenging you, I'm not getting up in your face on this one, I'm just, I'm just asking you this morning.
[time=2718] I would encourage you, I would invite you and having done this myself, I know the power
[time=2724] that it, that it possesses the way the things God does in a heart, a heart that's willing
[time=2730] to do this, it's an amazing thing, I would encourage you this morning with whoever came to mind, whatever name you might write down, whatever circumstance you may be kind of focusing in on today as we try to practically bring application to this, pray for him.
[time=2747] Pray for her, pray for them, genuinely before God, each morning, each night this week, pray
[time=2754] for an enemy and see what God does in your spirit.
[time=2759] If your enemy is hungry, feed him, if your enemy is thirsty, give him a drink and in
[time=2765] so doing you will heap burning coals on their head.
[time=2769] People often ask me, what's the deal with this heaping burning coals thing?
[time=2773] What's that all about?
[time=2774] Well you know what, it is a, I double checked this with Mitch this week, we talked about it, I think we both understand that to be an ancient Egyptian custom, I believe that's
[time=2785] what it is, I've heard this many times actually, it was an ancient Egyptian custom when a person
[time=2791] wanted to demonstrate public remorse or contrition, he would carry a pan of burning coals on his
[time=2797] head to symbolize the burning pain of his shame and his guilt.
[time=2806] That's what that's about, it is about the shame and the guilt that comes, now listen,
[time=2812] you don't bring, you don't bring the shame, you don't bring the guilt, what do you do?
[time=2819] You live, you live at peace, you don't pay back evil for evil, no, you do the right thing,
[time=2825] you live a transformed life, if they're hungry, you feed them, if they're thirsty, you give
[time=2831] them a drink, as far as it depends on you, you live in harmony.
[time=2837] God takes that willingness in you and me to obey him and God in his time and his place,
[time=2843] he brings about whatever level of conviction, whatever presence of shame and guilt, God brings that in oftentimes, God has a way of using your sacrificial act of kindness to
[time=2856] help prompt into the heart and mind and soul of the evil doer, a realization of their
[time=2864] insensitivity, their sin and the pain that they've caused.
[time=2872] Don't be overcome by evil, go back to our passage, last line, verse 21, don't be over
[time=2878] come by evil, he says, but overcome evil with good, I want to just say this to you one last
[time=2884] thought, while it's clear that in the loving arms of a God who cares for and protects us
[time=2891] faithfully, we are kept from being overwhelmed by the evil of others, there is one more application
[time=2897] I want you to see, we must not listen, we must not be overcome by our own evil responses
[time=2906] to their evil, does that make sense?
[time=2910] Our own evil people, evil has come upon you, he'll protect you from that, he'll allow
[time=2918] you not to be overwhelmed, he will do that but while that's true you also have to be careful because if your response to evil is evil, your own evil is infinitely more destructive
[time=2931] and detrimental to you then is the evil done to you by others, I've seen it a hundred
[time=2938] times, I've seen it a thousand times, people wasting away and wasting their lives trying
[time=2945] to get even and he says don't be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good, transformed
[time=2956] living, I'm going to ask Eric and Hugh if they'd come up, I want you to just settle into your
[time=2963] seats here for the last couple minutes, I'm so grateful that Eric and Hugh are willing to do this this morning, you know I was talking with Corbin and Eric and the team, we were just trying to think of a way to maybe conclude our eight weeks and I just asked them a favor
[time=2978] and they were gracious and they allowed me to kind of just to do this here, I want to
[time=2985] say it to you this way, one of my all time favorite songs of all time, these guys have
[time=2994] agreed to come and do for us this morning and the reason I've asked them to do this song
[time=3000] to kind of wrap up our series is this, I continue to travel this road of life transformation
[time=3008] with each and every one of you and I just have to admit that there are days and there are
[time=3016] nights when in my journey and in the midst of the continued struggle and failure that
[time=3028] I experience, choices that I make that I shouldn't have and attitudes I harbor that don't honor
[time=3036] God and the roads I go down at times that I shouldn't travel, there are times when in
[time=3044] my heart I sometimes kind of just lay there or kneel there or stand there before God and say you know what, I feel like sometimes I'm untransformable, I don't know if that's
[time=3056] a word but do you understand what I mean, like I just look at them sometimes in my heart and I think I don't think I don't think I'm going to change, you've been trying so hard
[time=3068] all this time God and I just keep fowing the stuff up and it's disappointing sometimes
[time=3077] and it's discouraging sometimes but all the time he continues to say back to me in a number
[time=3084] of different ways that he loves me and that work he began in me he's not going to quit
[time=3091] he is going to keep working with me he is going to keep transforming me and it just makes
[time=3098] me so very grateful for his patience with me that makes sense so there's this song and I just thought you know I don't know if you can relate with that but if you're thankful today for his faithful commitment to you if you're thankful today that he has this loving
[time=3116] gracious attitude that while you continue again and again and again to move in directions
[time=3123] he's trying to steer you away he keeps bringing you back if you're grateful for that then
[time=3129] I think the message and the truth of the song it just touches your heart it's by our friend
[time=3136] Tommy Walker and I just hope you listen to it I hope as he eric and you bring it to us
[time=3142] this morning if you need to spend some time with him do so if you want to sing it sing it you want to just take it and take it in but what a faithful God we have.
[time=3176] What a good God you've been to me
[time=3199] your goodness and your grace every day Lord I see what else can I do but give my deepest
[time=3218] thanks to you what a good God you've been to me
[time=3236] what a faithful God you've been to me you've provided me far beyond everything I'd ever
[time=3256] so I can't do but give my deepest thanks to you what a faithful God you've been to me
[time=3274] what a lovely God you've been to me you shed your blood on the cross so that I could stand
[time=3295] dear and be free so what else can I do but give my deepest heartfelt thanks to you
[time=3312] what a lovely God you've been what a faithful God you've been
[time=3331] I'm gonna ask Eric to just play for a moment here and I'm gonna ask you if you would
[time=3351] just quietly stand with me you know when I think about it it's it's really pretty compelling
[time=3359] there are times when in my spirit before God I just want to express to God that he is amazing
[time=3366] and sometimes when I feel that I just kind of want to I just want to thank God you rock
[time=3373] a God you're amazing God I love you sometimes I want to say God just take me I'm a mess and
[time=3379] find myself just kind of saying here I am I was thinking about today closing up the series
[time=3385] and so much of what we've seen God kind of paints a picture for you and I have transformed living and he says there it is there it is transform living what are you gonna do and
[time=3396] I am my mind this morning first hour it just kind of went I don't know why but my mind went to the classroom and my mind went to being in third grade or second grade and the teacher asks a question and you want to respond and what do you do it's kind of like it's kind
[time=3413] of like this it's like I I may not know everything and I may not have it all figured out but
[time=3419] but I do this and this is saying I want to respond what you've been teaching me teacher
[time=3426] what you've been saying here I kind of I'm starting to get it and I think I can answer this question so boom the hand goes up I want to respond and so I would just invite you
[time=3436] this morning with your heads bowed and your eyes closed if you would be willing this morning
[time=3442] to just before God and God alone lift a hand of response a hand that says I don't have
[time=3448] it all figured out God but what you've taught me these last eight weeks this picture of transformed living I want to respond and I need your help and so if you'll just if you'll
[time=3458] just do that if it would be on your heart this morning to just before God lift a hand that says I desire God to to continue this path of transformation I want to respond to
[time=3469] you just lift it up there oh Father God we we stand before you humbly this morning many
[time=3475] of us with hands lifted hands that say we were so grateful for what you've been teaching us and we're so thankful for the lessons learned and like with a teacher we just want to engage
[time=3486] with you and we want to respond and God we want to keep walking down this road we'll need your help and we'll need your guidance and we'll need your forgiveness and we'll need your strength so God please grant it what a good God you are what a faithful God
[time=3500] you've been what a loving God to continue to work with the likes of us we love you and
[time=3509] they all agreed with the prayer and they all said with one voice amen
[time=3539] you.
