[time=30] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=59] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=66] [MUSIC]
[time=71] Therefore go and make disciples of allness.
[time=74] Adaptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=79] [MUSIC]
[time=86] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=94] [MUSIC]
[time=98] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=101] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=121] Whenever I could see it all, just where God brought me from, the life of emptiness I lived without God said.
[time=136] My heart cried hallelujah, 'cause the Savior rescued me, without His precious love, where would I be?
[time=150] I would be lost, I would be tripped in life as she monsterly sees, without the sacrifice that Jesus liked before.
[time=165] I would be dead within my sin forever, knowing to be deep.
[time=173] If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord.
[time=194] [MUSIC]
[time=196] Since the joy has saved me, just look where I've come from, and now we're made into the likeness of God said.
[time=211] [MUSIC]
[time=225] I would be lost, I would be tripped in life as she monsterly sees, without the sacrifice that Jesus liked before.
[time=240] I would be dead within my sin forever, knowing to be free.
[time=248] If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord.
[time=278] Jesus brought me out of darkness into His marvelous life, and placed me on the sun and brought to stay.
[time=292] And now I'm walking with my Savior, and I'm not fighting the good luck, because of Jesus I can truly say.
[time=308] I would be lost, I would be dead within my sin forever, knowing to be free.
[time=329] If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord.
[time=441] Well, let me welcome you once again to the Bible Hour broadcast.
[time=450] It is great to have you with us again.
[time=452] If you're tuning in for the first time, let me introduce myself to you.
[time=456] My name is Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege, and I mean that.
[time=459] It is an absolute privilege to serve here on staff at Black Hawk Ministries as the Senior Pastor.
[time=465] I get to work with an amazing team of people.
[time=468] And God is helping us in amazing ways in our efforts to come alongside seeking people.
[time=475] We exist here to help seekers find and then know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=481] And we love what we get to do, and we're so thankful that we get to bring this broadcast to you.
[time=486] Hey, as part of our ministry here at Black Hawk, many of you know that for over 30 years Black Hawk Christian School has been a part of what God has been doing here in the Fort Wayne community.
[time=496] And I just want to encourage you, we just recently opened our re-enrollment and new enrollment to all folks.
[time=503] We've been taking care of the existing people, alumni, those currently attending, but now it's been open to the public.
[time=510] And there's a number here on the screen. It's the school number.
[time=514] And if you'd be interested in looking into educating your kids with a Christ-centered education,
[time=521] if you'd be interested in exposing them and having them be in a situation where they could be not only loved and cared for from a spiritual perspective,
[time=529] but invested in on an educational front with the highest quality and excellence, I would encourage you to call.
[time=536] Black Hawk Christian School has been equipping and encouraging and teaching young people for years and years.
[time=543] And I bet you'd be absolutely amazed at what you'd find.
[time=547] Give McCall, come by for a tour, come by for an interview we'd love to have you look in to what God is doing at our school.
[time=554] Also this morning on the broadcast you're going to hear from Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=559] Jim is a good friend of ours, a good friend of mine, and is part of the Fort Wayne community.
[time=565] He pastors over at Brookside, Brookside Community Church, and he has recently written a book.
[time=572] The book is entitled "Mindfields in the Marketplace" and Jim gives enormous, very insightful, and very effective insights
[time=582] into the life that so many folks live today in the marketplace, some of the pitfalls that are there, some of the temptations that are faced,
[time=592] and ways that you can move through that. That book is available in bookstores and Jim comes today to share that message with us.
[time=599] I'm so thankful that he came this last week. I was able to go and speak at his church and what a great, great weekend it was
[time=608] for the Brookside and for the Black Hawk families. Thank you so very much for tuning in. God bless you.
[time=614] And as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=617] Our hope and comfort hear our prayer. Forgive us for not seeing the needs of others.
[time=625] Especially when it was within our power to help them. Forgive us for judging the sins of others and justifying our own.
[time=634] Forgive us for those times we pretended to be something that we're not.
[time=639] Forgive us our bad choices when we knew better. Forgive us our laziness when it comes to good.
[time=647] For putting off prayer when it is so easy. For not feeding the hungry when it costs so little.
[time=654] For not being there for our family although nothing is more important.
[time=660] Forgive us, oh God. For the times that we have hidden from you because we felt guilty over our sin.
[time=667] Forgive us for not believing with all our hearts that you delight in mercy.
[time=672] Through Jesus your Son bathe our souls and innocence. Rejoice over us with the song of salvation.
[time=681] In your grace give us beauty for ashes, strength for weakness, light for darkness and laughter for tears.
[time=690] We praise you Father for lifting our burden, clearing our record, purifying our hearts and renewing our minds.
[time=699] Now unto the king eternal immortal and visible the only true God the honor and glory forever. Amen.
[time=711] Sing that again. I will worship.
[time=715] And I will worship you Lord, only you Lord. And I will bow down before you, only you Lord.
[time=756] And I will worship you Lord, only you Lord.
[time=766] And I will bow down before you, only you Lord.
[time=779] Romans 8 says therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=787] Because through Christ Jesus the law of the spirit of life has set me free from the law of sin and death.
[time=795] For what the law was powerless to do and that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did.
[time=802] By sending his own son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so it condemned sin in sinful man.
[time=811] And in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us who do not live according to the sinful nature, but according to the spirit.
[time=823] I love the line that Stephanie read that said Lord Jesus bathed our souls in innocence.
[time=831] We need to be in Christ to have souls that are innocent.
[time=839] In Christ alone my hope is found, he is my light, my strength, my song, this cornerstone, this solid ground, firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
[time=861] In the heights of love what depths of peace, when fears are still, when striving cease, my comforter, my all in all.
[time=877] Here in the love of Christ I stand.
[time=885] In Christ alone, to God flesh, fullness of God in hell, expand this gift of love and righteousness,
[time=901] scored by the ones he came to seek, to love that lost as Jesus died. The love of God was satisfied for every sin on him was laid.
[time=922] Here in the death of Christ I live.
[time=931] [MUSIC]
[time=944] Would you stand with us as we sing this next verse?
[time=950] There in the cloud his body lay, via the womb by darkness swaying, then bursting forth in glorious day.
[time=966] Up from the grave he rose again, and as he stands in victory, since curse has lost his grave of me, for I am this, and he is mine, far with a precious world of Christ.
[time=995] In Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground you sing and send, through all other ground we sing and send.
[time=1014] No kill to life, no fear in death, this is the power of Christ in me, from Christ, from Christ to the final breath.
[time=1030] Jesus, it is my destiny, the power of death does keep our man, he never got me from his name.
[time=1048] Till he returns or calls me home, shear in the blood of Christ's name.
[time=1063] [MUSIC]
[time=1082] Would you pray with me? Yeah, go ahead.
[time=1093] And now God we just say thank you.
[time=1098] Thank you for doing what in and of ourselves we could not do, through Christ.
[time=1107] For us by your grace, your undeserved love, unmerited favor bestowed on us, that we can even stand in Christ.
[time=1120] And God I pray that by the power of your Holy Spirit that you would move in each heart, each person here today, God, to shape that heart to be more like yours.
[time=1132] And that that would continue through the teaching of your word, that each person would feel in a powerful way, that they would leave here different, different than when they came into your presence and celebrated life abundant and eternal with you.
[time=1156] We love you and we praise you, God, for who you are, for what you've done and for what you're about to do.
[time=1163] In Jesus' name and all God's people agreed and said, amen, you may be seated.
[time=1168] We are blessed today with a speaker who's not just a pastor, but he's an author and I've read his book and it will be available in the foyer.
[time=1177] And I've read hundreds of Christian business books and kind of my pet peeve with Christian business books is that they tend to communicate principles void of a personal relationship with Christ.
[time=1188] And by that I mean they don't leave it open for God to do something a little different in you than he does in me and for it to be relational.
[time=1199] And I'm telling you, this book, "Mine Feels in the Marketplace" does just that. He's transparent, he's authentic, just incredible, just incredible.
[time=1209] I was talking with Mark Kaufman this morning who's read hundreds of Christian business books, he reads one about every other day and he read this and he said this is absolutely a must read.
[time=1220] I tell you I was so high on it when I got done that I almost wondered if it would just grow hair because it was that powerful.
[time=1228] And it will be available, it will be available in the foyer, so if you came prepared today you should definitely pick one up, definitely pick one up.
[time=1235] It is absolutely a powerful, powerful read applicable to your life.
[time=1240] And we're blessed to have the author with us today, his roots in pastoring are right here, he was a pastor on staff at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=1247] He went to pastor a church in North Dakota that grew so big that literally this is true, people parked in other churches parking lots to come to his service.
[time=1256] And he felt called back to Fort Wayne and now pastors, Brookside Church.
[time=1262] So would you please give a warm Blackhawk welcome to a man who's been in the marketplace and pastoring the church, Jim Pearson.
[time=1277] And not only did they park in parking lots of other churches, they walked three blocks in 30 below zero weather in Fargo, North Dakota.
[time=1287] That was a story, now I got to tell you that there was only 40 parking spaces in our whole parking lot at that time.
[time=1294] And then we built our new church and we had all the parking spaces you could ever want.
[time=1299] Well hey, this has been a great day for me already. Yesterday was a great day for me. I am a tremendous basketball fan.
[time=1308] And Indiana beat Michigan. And then I was in the gymnasium last night when Blackhawk won its fourth straight sectional.
[time=1319] I've been there for all four. My son Kyle played on the first three.
[time=1324] And then he played on three regional championships and probably gave me the most exciting day of my life.
[time=1331] Well, I've got married, I better put that in there.
[time=1335] But one of the most exciting days of my life was winning the semi-state at Warsaw.
[time=1341] That was just like unbelievably awesome. I went absolutely nuts. I was hyperventilating.
[time=1348] I turned around and hugged my wife. I turned around and hugged other people's wives.
[time=1354] I was just absolutely crazy. And I got to tell you, Kyle and both my boys went to the school.
[time=1362] But my youngest Kyle got a chance to go to the state finals in golf with Coach Elijah.
[time=1368] Played on I think three sectional championship golf teams.
[time=1372] One regional made a trip to the state finals down in Indianapolis at the legends.
[time=1377] I mean, his experience at Blackhawk Christian was awesome.
[time=1380] Let me give you though the most important takeaway of all.
[time=1384] He's down at the University of Indianapolis and he came home shortly after school started.
[time=1388] And he was sharing with us that, you know, he's had to make some decisions.
[time=1393] And we've talked about ethical decisions he had to make based upon what he learned here at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=1400] And he said this. He said, yeah, he said he found himself in a couple of situations where he had to make decisions. And this is what he said, Coach Merrill.
[time=1410] He said, I had to make a decision one time and I literally could hear the words in my ear,
[time=1416] Coach Merrill telling the team. It takes a lifetime to build a reputation.
[time=1423] But only one bad decision to ruin it.
[time=1427] That's the most important takeaway from his years at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=1432] Our roots go deep here at Blackhawk Ministries. I came into ministry here.
[time=1436] My oldest son also graduated from the high school here, played on a sectional championship golf team.
[time=1442] It's great to see that my wife Linda taught here at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=1448] She was the children's director at Blackhawk Ministries in addition to that for three years.
[time=1453] My new youth pastor, Phil Knuth, is a graduate of Blackhawk Christian School and Moody Bible Institute.
[time=1459] He just joined us about three months ago and I got to tell you, my backup communicator at Brookside, Brian Clay, is a graduate of Blackhawk Christian School
[time=1470] and one of the finest communicators of God's Word in the city of Fort Wayne, and you probably don't have to stop there. And he preaches for me about five or six or seven times a year.
[time=1481] It is just awesome. Now, this is not usual for me. There's people on the front rows.
[time=1486] At Brookside, very few people sit in the front row and I went home one night and I said to my wife,
[time=1492] I said, "Linda, why is it nobody sits on the front row at Brookside?" And she looked at me and she said, "I got to tell you this. It's because you spit so much when you preach."
[time=1503] So if I go crazy and start to foam and spit, you're probably further and farther back.
[time=1509] It's not going to bother you. But hey, we're here to look at God's Word.
[time=1513] Let's pray together. Father, thanks for this day.
[time=1519] And I thank you for the privilege of being here.
[time=1522] And what a joy it is to see friends, some that I see every now and then, some I see regularly,
[time=1528] but some that I haven't seen for more than a decade.
[time=1531] And I just thank you for the chance to shake their hand today and say hello and renew friendships.
[time=1535] Father, thank you for the privilege of sharing your Word right now in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1541] I want to tell you a story.
[time=1543] My father, Robert Pearson, served in the British Army for seven years.
[time=1550] From 1938 to 1945, he faithfully fought for the Allied cause in World War II.
[time=1558] Now, seven years is a substantial segment of any man's life, any woman's life,
[time=1564] yet my father rarely spoke about his experiences in the war.
[time=1569] He was a rather British, very private type of man.
[time=1573] And when I was a little boy, I would watch war movies.
[time=1576] And after the war movies, I would often ask my father questions about the war.
[time=1581] Usually, he said very little. But occasionally, occasionally, he would give me a little bit of a glimpse of his experience in the war.
[time=1592] On a couple of occasions, my father told me about his experiences with minefields.
[time=1598] You see, my father was a part of a team.
[time=1600] And one of their major assignments was to scout out the minefields and then clear out the landmines so that their squadron could safely cross the minefield.
[time=1612] And he shared a story about one time when he was hard at work,
[time=1618] and they were doing their thing, and it was a very dangerous job.
[time=1622] And he said, as they were going about the cleaning out of the landmines, they heard a click.
[time=1629] And the click meant that one of their team had stepped on a German landmine.
[time=1636] And if that soldier lifted his foot, the mine would fly up, it would explode.
[time=1642] He would be killed, some of them might be killed.
[time=1644] They would probably all be injured.
[time=1646] He said that the man froze in terror.
[time=1649] But finally, he said, him and his team were able to come around the man.
[time=1653] Somehow, they were able to keep the mine from exploding.
[time=1658] But he said to me, Jim, it's the type of experience that one never forgets.
[time=1664] And all of those years after the war, I could still see the emotion on his face
[time=1670] as he told me that story.
[time=1673] You know, minefields are dangerous.
[time=1678] Avoiding the minefields, avoiding the landmines, and somehow crossing the minefield safely
[time=1684] is what every soldier wants to do.
[time=1686] Now, I want to talk with you this morning about that danger of minefields, but it's not the minefields.
[time=1693] Not about the minefields that my father encountered in World War II.
[time=1697] They were, they would put you in harm's way in a physical sense.
[time=1702] But what I want to talk to you about, I want to talk about with you this morning, is about the minefields that you face, I face, every day.
[time=1712] Spiritual minefields.
[time=1714] Minefields that threaten our walk with Christ.
[time=1717] Minefields that threaten to undo and to come between us and our Lord.
[time=1723] Minefields that threaten our testimony.
[time=1726] That's what I want to talk about this morning.
[time=1729] Now, as Mitchell mentioned, I've written a new book.
[time=1731] It's entitled "Minefields in the Marketplace." The book, I identify six minefields.
[time=1738] Six minefields that I sat and wrote down one day back in North Dakota
[time=1744] after I had had another session with a Christian businessman who had stepped on a landmine.
[time=1750] He hadn't blown up his career, but he had blown up his testimony.
[time=1754] And I sat down and I began to think about encounters I had with business people when I was on staff here at Blackhawk.
[time=1760] People that were coming to me at my church in North Dakota.
[time=1763] And I identified six minefields, and we can only talk about three of them this morning in this message,
[time=1770] but there's six different ones that I identify in the book.
[time=1774] What I want to do this morning is talk to you about these minefields.
[time=1778] Now, you say, "Well, Jim, I'm not a businessman.
[time=1780] I'm not a businesswoman. I'm not out there in the corporate world.
[time=1783] It doesn't make any difference.
[time=1785] If you're a doctor, if you're a nurse, if you're a teacher, if you're a student,
[time=1791] if you're a minister, if you're a stay-at-home mom, it matters not you face these same spiritual minefields every day of your life.
[time=1800] I have merely written in the book about them from a businessman's perspective from my years as I worked at the Omnisource Corporation here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1809] So let's get to God's Word, and let's dig in, and I want to talk about three minefields,
[time=1815] three spiritual minefields that we face each day.
[time=1818] The first minefield that I want us to consider is what I've called the minefield of ethical compromise.
[time=1824] And I want you to turn with me in the Old Testament to Proverbs, chapter 22, and I'll be reading from there in just a few moments.
[time=1831] The minefield of ethical compromise.
[time=1833] Ethical compromise is pandemic in our society today and in our culture.
[time=1839] Enron, Tycho, Adelphia Communications, WorldCom,
[time=1846] we all know the stories.
[time=1848] They're in the news, even this weekend they're in the news.
[time=1851] One of those Adelphia Communications Executive was just sentenced for his role in the scandal there.
[time=1857] Those corporations and others have become symbols of lying, cheating, stealing,
[time=1863] and all sorts of corporate greed and fraud.
[time=1866] But let me say this, it's not just the Enrons and the Tycos that I'm referring to.
[time=1873] You see, ethical compromise saturates our society.
[time=1879] I was reading just a few months ago that universities are alerting their faculties of so-called cheat sites that have popped up on the internet where students can go and pay for and download professionally written term papers
[time=1894] guaranteed to get you a certain grade.
[time=1897] I also read recently Rutgers University Management Education Center survey
[time=1903] that of 4,500 American high school students.
[time=1907] Of that 4,575% admitted to engaging in serious cheating on a regular basis.
[time=1916] Several years ago, James Patterson and Peter Kim wrote a book entitled The Day America Told the Truth.
[time=1922] The research for their book included a survey of thousands of Americans from their research they determined that lying is deeply embedded in the American culture.
[time=1933] Two-thirds of those surveyed said there was two-thirds of the survey said there is nothing wrong with lying, nothing wrong at all.
[time=1943] Only 31% said they believed that honesty is the best policy.
[time=1950] But friends, though the society around us doesn't seem to care about integrity and character,
[time=1957] the Bible teaches that as followers of Christ, we are to care.
[time=1961] We're to care very much.
[time=1963] God cares a lot about your character and your integrity and the reputation you have.
[time=1969] Proverbs chapter 12 verse 22 says, "The Lord detests lying lips,
[time=1975] but he delights in men who are truthful." Proverbs 19 verse 11 says that an honest scales and balances are from the Lord.
[time=1986] Now, the reason, in case that's hard to understand, what that's speaking about there is in that day in the marketplace.
[time=1993] As business men would be out there in the marketplace, they would have a primitive type of scale like we have today and they learned how to cheat their customers in order to maximize their profit.
[time=2004] That's what that's referring to.
[time=2006] But he said honest scales are from the Lord.
[time=2009] In other words, God wants us to be honest and upright and have character and integrity in our business dealings.
[time=2017] What should be our goal as Christians, living this life, facing the mind field,
[time=2023] but when it comes to the issue, especially here, of ethics and integrity in character.
[time=2029] In Proverbs 22 verse 1, we have a verse that if you're a Christian businessman or woman, I think it ought to be your life's verse.
[time=2037] Or if you are out there in school building that reputation as an individual,
[time=2043] as a Christian, or if you're in the community, whatever the case, it's a great life's verse, verse 1 it says.
[time=2049] A good name is more desirable than great riches.
[time=2054] To be esteemed is better than silver or gold.
[time=2058] Now, what's that saying?
[time=2060] He's saying that a good name, a reputation, a reputation for honesty, for character, for integrity, for goodness, a good name, a good reputation is more desirable than anything the world could ever give you.
[time=2074] More desirable than great riches.
[time=2077] To be held in high esteem by others because of who you are
[time=2083] is better than any amount of silver or gold.
[time=2088] In the eyes of God, that verse is telling us good character, an honorable reputation, those things are of the highest importance.
[time=2097] I think it's a great life's verse.
[time=2100] Let me tell you a story, it's not true story, it's a joke.
[time=2103] But it's a story that I read a few months ago.
[time=2106] A story is told of a young man who went off to college.
[time=2110] And first semester he did pretty well.
[time=2114] He went off and he studied hard and worked hard.
[time=2117] First semester grades were good and came home for Christmas and had a good break.
[time=2123] But when he went back for the second semester he kind of got into the party life and the dorm life and the fraternity life and he kind of blew off his studies and when it came time for final exams.
[time=2134] I mean, he was in trouble.
[time=2137] So he and two of his fraternity friends who had been kind of doing the same things, they decided to form a little bit of a cheating ring.
[time=2145] And they were going to cheat on final exams, but they got caught.
[time=2149] And the dean of the college called him in and this is what he told him.
[time=2152] He said, "You guys are going to get F's in all your courses.
[time=2155] I'm not going to expel you from the school.
[time=2157] You can come back in the fall, but you're going to be on probation." Well, the young man came home and walked through the front door and there was his dad and his mom looking rather angry but also disappointed.
[time=2170] His father looked at him and he said, "Son, I got to tell you, we are disappointed." And I know the dean said in his letter that we got in the mail that you can come back to school in the fall.
[time=2179] And if that's what you want to do, you can go, but I'm going to tell you right now.
[time=2182] I'm not paying for it.
[time=2183] You're going to have to earn your own way.
[time=2185] You're going to have to work hard all summer in the morning, during the day, in the evening, earn your own way.
[time=2190] I'm not going to give you any more money for college because of what happened.
[time=2194] You need to know there's a consequence to your action.
[time=2197] Well, the young man didn't like it, but he wanted to go back to the college, and so he went out the next day and got a job.
[time=2202] Then he found a job in the evening.
[time=2205] Now, his father had also told him that the family had planned on taking a two-week vacation
[time=2211] to Greece, and it was a vacation that they had planned that they had all looked forward to.
[time=2217] Part of his punishment was he wasn't going to get to go.
[time=2220] He went to work.
[time=2221] He worked hard.
[time=2222] After a few weeks, his family went off to Greece, and after a few days he got this postcard
[time=2229] in the mail, and he opened up the postcard and he read it was from his mother.
[time=2233] The postcard said, "Dear son, yesterday we arrived in the nation of Greece.
[time=2240] Today we climb to the top of a mountain where ancient Spartan women used to sacrifice
[time=2248] their defective children.
[time=2251] Wish you were here."
[time=2257] Ever felt that way?
[time=2260] You know, none of us are immune to temptation, and all of us stumble.
[time=2266] But the Bible says that ethical compromise is not to be a part of our life.
[time=2272] All of us are tempted.
[time=2273] Now, you might say, "But Jim, ethical compromise is all around me.
[time=2277] Nobody lies to make the sale at work.
[time=2280] Everybody cheats to pass the test in school.
[time=2283] Everybody fudges on their tax return to get a little extra money.
[time=2286] What am I to do?" Well, let me tell you what the Bible says.
[time=2290] The Bible says, "Be different." Be different.
[time=2296] You see, we need to be different.
[time=2299] You see, we're called to a higher standard.
[time=2302] I love Romans chapter 12, verse 2, because in here I think we have or see a way in which
[time=2310] we can be different.
[time=2312] It's a command, but I think it also gives us a way to reach and follow the command.
[time=2319] In Romans chapter 12, verse 2, Paul is writing, obviously, and he says this.
[time=2324] He says, "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world.
[time=2330] Be transformed by the renewing of your mind." Now, let's walk through that for a second.
[time=2336] "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world." What's he saying?
[time=2340] He's saying, "You people have become followers of Christ." And so the old way of living is out.
[time=2347] I have called you to a higher standard.
[time=2350] And what he is saying is, "No longer let the society around you squeeze you into their
[time=2356] world, no longer let the society around you squeeze you make it what it wants you to be,
[time=2363] but rather be transformed." How?
[time=2367] By the renewing of your mind.
[time=2369] He's saying, "Learn to think differently.
[time=2372] Learn to think in a different way than you did before." Now, you say, "How does that play out?" Well, if you're an active part of Black Hawk Ministries, let me tell you just a few ways that it can play out.
[time=2383] But first of all, I would encourage you that if you're active, to get actively involved in the various disciple-making ministries that are offered here, the adult Bible fellowship classes in small groups like we offer at Brookside and that you offer here.
[time=2398] And I would encourage you when you come in on Sunday morning, when Kelly and Mitch and
[time=2404] Steve are preaching, come with a heart ready to learn, come with a Bible that's open and
[time=2411] let the Word of God transform you and renew your mind.
[time=2415] And study on your own and have an accountability partner who's not afraid to call you out when
[time=2423] what you're doing is wrong and have a regular time with God.
[time=2427] Here's my application.
[time=2429] Renew your mind.
[time=2431] Be different.
[time=2435] We're not to fall victim to the mind field of ethical compromise.
[time=2440] We can't avoid it, but we can make it safely through.
[time=2444] Now, there's a second one I want us to look at, and that's the mind field of materialism.
[time=2448] The mind field of materialism, and we're going to look again at several verses, but I want to start in Matthew chapter 6.
[time=2455] In Matthew chapter 6, we have some powerful verses that warn against the dangers of materialism.
[time=2464] This time it's Jesus who is speaking, and as he addresses those that are listening, he says this.
[time=2469] He says, "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where
[time=2480] thieves break in and steal." Now, what's he saying?
[time=2483] Do not store up.
[time=2484] In other words, do not consume yourselves.
[time=2487] Do not be consumed with hoarding, stacking, piling up this world's goods.
[time=2493] Don't spend your life seeking to just get more and more and more.
[time=2498] Don't be consumed with that.
[time=2500] He said, "Because number one, it's futile." He says, "If it's clothing that you're trying to accumulate, moths are going to come, and they're going to eat it, and the clothing will be destroyed." And if it's metal, steel, iron, objects, they're eventually going to rust and corrode.
[time=2515] They're going to be gone, so there's no point there.
[time=2518] And then if anything else is left, thieves are going to break in and steal it.
[time=2522] So Jesus is saying it's futile.
[time=2524] Don't be consumed with the things of this world.
[time=2527] Notice he says, "But," that's a very strong word there, strong contrast.
[time=2531] "But, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy
[time=2538] and where thieves do not break in and steal." He's saying, "Be different.
[time=2543] Be different.
[time=2544] Don't be like everyone else." No, don't be consumed by the things of this world.
[time=2549] Be consumed by the things of God.
[time=2551] Be consumed with piling up treasures in heaven.
[time=2554] What does that mean?
[time=2555] It means plugging in to a ministry such as this.
[time=2559] It means being actively involved in evangelism.
[time=2563] It means being actively involved in discipleship and discipling others.
[time=2567] It means being actively involved in the worldwide missions movement.
[time=2571] It means being actively involved in furthering the kingdom.
[time=2575] Let that be the consuming thing in your life.
[time=2578] And then in verse 24, he says this.
[time=2581] He says, "No one can serve two masters.
[time=2584] Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
[time=2589] You cannot serve both God and money." You can't be consumed with both.
[time=2594] It's going to be one or the other.
[time=2596] Now you hear that and you say, "Well, Pastor Jim, how can I avoid getting sucked in to this materialism, this materialistic track?
[time=2605] How do I make it safely through the minefield of materialism?" Well, in my book, I have three things in the chapter on materialism
[time=2614] that I speak about, three principles.
[time=2616] I want to give you one of them this morning, because I think it's probably the biggest one, and it's this.
[time=2621] Right from the beginning, develop an attitude of stewardship rather than ownership.
[time=2629] Right from the beginning, as you get started in life, and if you're older like I am at 54 years old, then just right now, say from now on, this is the way I'm going to view the things that I have that God has given me.
[time=2642] Develop an attitude of stewardship rather than ownership.
[time=2648] What I mean by that is this, God owns it all.
[time=2652] God owns it all.
[time=2654] I am merely the manager, the steward of what God has entrusted to me, and I am to manage it, I don't own it.
[time=2662] Let's look at a couple of verses that I think are key that teach this important truth.
[time=2666] First of all, in Psalms, in Psalms 24, Psalm 24 verse 1 says, "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it." Notice that? I circled that word everything.
[time=2679] Everything in the world and all who live in it.
[time=2682] Notice those inclusive words, everything, all.
[time=2686] The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it. In other words, God owns it all.
[time=2692] It's saying He created it, He sustains it, He owns it.
[time=2696] God is the owner. And then in Deuteronomy chapter 10, it says basically the same thing, but a little different.
[time=2705] It says, "To the Lord your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it." I like that.
[time=2712] What it's saying there is, to the Lord belongs the heavens, everything, then He adds what He says, even to the very highest heavens.
[time=2721] As high as you can go, as low as you can go, God owns it all.
[time=2727] And we need to realize that that's the case.
[time=2731] We are merely the stewards, the managers of all that He is entrusted to us.
[time=2734] I like to put it this way. I literally possess much, but I own nothing.
[time=2741] Everything I have has been given to me by God.
[time=2744] Now, if a person has gotten caught in the mind field of materialism
[time=2750] and you ask Him how much is enough, this is the way He will answer.
[time=2754] It may not be in these words, but this is what's in His heart.
[time=2757] Just a little bit more. Just a little bit more.
[time=2761] Just a little bit more than I have, because you see, no matter how much we have, if that's what we're after in life, we're never satisfied.
[time=2768] There is nothing in the material world that can minister to the spiritual part of a man.
[time=2774] Nothing in the material world.
[time=2776] And that's why things don't satisfy because nothing material will ever bring you the joy and contentment.
[time=2783] Only spiritual things can bring that joy and contentment to your life.
[time=2789] Now, don't misunderstand me.
[time=2791] There's nothing wrong with having things.
[time=2794] It's good to work hard, and we need to save for retirement and college tuition.
[time=2800] I have a son who graduated from Taylor University just a couple of years ago and a son who was a freshman at the University of Indianapolis.
[time=2806] I know the importance of saving for college tuition, and we need to save for a rainy day.
[time=2813] We need to do that.
[time=2817] But we need to be careful.
[time=2819] Watch out for the mind field.
[time=2820] And you know what? Pastors.
[time=2823] People like myself.
[time=2825] We're not exempt from this mind field.
[time=2827] Not exempt from the temptation.
[time=2829] I read not too long ago about a man who walked into a Baptist church.
[time=2833] First Baptist church.
[time=2835] Walked in, walked in, wanted to see the pastor, walked into the pastor's office, and he said, "Pastor, I'm wondering if you would do a funeral for me." Pastor said, "Well, tell me who died." And the man said, "Well, it wasn't a person.
[time=2847] It was my dog." My wife and I loved our dog, and we had him for a long time, and we're looking for a church that will do a funeral for my dog.
[time=2858] The pastor was incredulous.
[time=2860] You know, how dare you come in to the first Baptist church and ask a pastor to do a funeral for a dog who doesn't even have a soul.
[time=2869] I'll have you know I don't do that.
[time=2871] You'll have to go to another church, and with that he dismissed the man.
[time=2875] He started to walk away, and as he did he turned by the door, and he said, "Pastor, can you steer me toward another church in town?" See, I was going to give the church $10,000 that did the funeral, and I was going to pay the pastor $2,500.
[time=2891] And with that the pastor jumped out of his seat, and he ran over, and he kind of got himself between the man and the doorway, and he said, "Well, my good man, why didn't you tell me that this was a Baptist dog?" You know, pastors, all of us.
[time=2910] We're all subject to that type of temptation.
[time=2914] Well, here's the application I have for this point.
[time=2917] Don't let your pursuit of things come between you and your relationship with God.
[time=2927] Don't let anything be more important.
[time=2931] Let's look at the third one, the minefield of sexual temptation.
[time=2934] Wow, this is a big one.
[time=2936] A couple of months ago I clicked on the financial headlines on MSNBC's website.
[time=2942] I was checking on stock market and that kind of thing, and a story popped up for me to read about the woes of pornography king Hugh Hefner.
[time=2953] Oh, it broke my heart that he was struggling.
[time=2956] Well, here's what it said.
[time=2958] It said that he was trying, struggling to make money.
[time=2962] His publishing empire was failing.
[time=2966] His magazine, which he founded in the early '50s, Playboy magazine, now has fallen to 19th on the list of American magazines in sales.
[time=2977] It ranks just below national geographic, and it said that he was losing money, and he was struggling to get his empire profitable again.
[time=2987] Well, I wish I could stand here this morning and tell you that it's because American men are now paying attention to more wholesome reading material.
[time=2998] But I can't tell you that.
[time=3000] You know the reason why he's losing money?
[time=3003] Competition from the Internet.
[time=3006] Internet pornography is everywhere, and Internet porn has grown since 1998 by 1800%.
[time=3018] And it's invaded the church, and many Christian men, and some Christian women are now addicted to Internet pornography and spending time on a daily basis in that struggle.
[time=3035] I want you to look at me, guys, and this is very serious here, okay?
[time=3041] If that computer you have in your office at home or your den is causing you to sin, then rip it out of the wall and throw it in the backyard.
[time=3053] You're rid of it.
[time=3055] We had a rule.
[time=3056] When my two boys were at school here at Black Hawk and when they were living at home and even on into my son, he went to Taylor Fort Wayne when he was home, we had a rule.
[time=3067] And the rule was you can't close the door of Dad's office when you're on the computer.
[time=3074] The door has to be open, and we're never to have, myself included, never to have any image on that screen that we would be embarrassed for someone else to see.
[time=3084] That was the rule.
[time=3088] Don't let that computer lead you down the path of sin.
[time=3092] But you know what? It's not just the internet.
[time=3094] Sexual temptation is everywhere in our society.
[time=3097] The minefield of sexual temptation is all around us.
[time=3100] God says, "Don't give in." God says, "My standard is high. You can make it." Let me look at you and make one more strong statement, but I believe it from the bottom of my heart.
[time=3110] It's as biblical as it can be.
[time=3112] There is no other relationship that glorifies God from the sexual perspective.
[time=3120] There is no other relationship that glorifies him other than the relationship of one man and one woman in the bonds of marriage.
[time=3131] That's the only relationship God honors.
[time=3134] It's the only one that pleases him.
[time=3136] There is no other.
[time=3138] Extramarital sexual relationships, premarital sexual relationships, addiction to internet pornography, and a sexual perversion of that nature.
[time=3148] Those are sexual activities which do not in any way bring pleasure to God.
[time=3156] They cause him great pain.
[time=3160] Let's look at Proverbs, chapter 6.
[time=3162] Proverbs, chapter 6.
[time=3164] Powerful, strong words.
[time=3169] I came across these doing research for my book a few years ago, and I'd read them before, but never with the power that they grip me with when I read them.
[time=3179] Verse 26 says, "For the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread." That basically means she reduces you to poverty.
[time=3187] "For the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulterous praise upon your very life." Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?
[time=3197] Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?
[time=3201] So is he who sleeps with another man's wife.
[time=3205] No one who touches her will go unpunished.
[time=3209] Now you may read that, guys, and you may say to yourself, "Well, I've never committed adultery.
[time=3214] I never would." Well, let's look at another couple of verses.
[time=3223] Matthew, chapter 5, the words of our Lord.
[time=3227] Matthew, chapter 5, verses 7 and 8.
[time=3232] I'm sorry, verses 27 and 28.
[time=3236] Jesus says you have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
[time=3254] An addiction to Internet porn, being on the Internet, looking at pornography for that type of sexual gratification is committing adultery in your heart,
[time=3268] whether there is a physical act of adultery or not.
[time=3275] Now, what are we to do?
[time=3277] How are you going to keep yourself sexually pure in our society today?
[time=3281] In the marketplace, in school, wherever it may be, what are we to do?
[time=3286] You know, we have to have a plan.
[time=3292] We have to have a strategy.
[time=3294] I often have -- it's usually men, but sometimes it's been women.
[time=3298] I've had men in my office who had fallen morally.
[time=3302] They'd made a huge error, mistake, bad decision, and they're broken.
[time=3308] They're tearful.
[time=3309] They're wanting to do what's right.
[time=3311] They're wanting to save their marriage, et cetera.
[time=3313] And we'll talk and we'll pray together and we go through a time of counseling.
[time=3316] And then I'll say to them, "Well, what's your plan?" More than once I've had the person look at me and say, "Well, I'm not really sure.
[time=3325] I don't want it to happen.
[time=3326] I guess I'm just hoping it won't happen again." Here's my answer to that, guys.
[time=3333] And ladies, hope is not a strategy.
[time=3337] Hope is not a strategy.
[time=3341] In my book, I share a strategy for those in the business world who travel out of town.
[time=3346] It's not rocket science, but you can stay pure.
[time=3349] If you are a teen, a college student, single adult, whoever, you need a strategy.
[time=3354] And it involves choices and discipline.
[time=3357] Regular times with God, it requires accountability.
[time=3360] You can make it safely through the minefield.
[time=3365] Joe Stoll, former -- now the former president of Moody Bible Institute said this, "Purity simply means that in all matters of life, we are not perfect, but we keep ourselves clean." Let me wrap this up with that.
[time=3380] Determine, determine to stay clean, to stay clean, to stay pure.
[time=3389] Now, that's just three minefields.
[time=3392] As I shared with you in my book, there's three more.
[time=3395] I discussed three more.
[time=3398] I want you to know how much I love the kindred spirit between Brookside Church
[time=3404] and Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=3406] It's so much fun and enjoyable to interact with your staff and for our staff.
[time=3411] And Pastor Kelly is wrapping things up at Brookside.
[time=3416] At least he should because we get out at noon there, too.
[time=3419] And it's just a joy to have him there.
[time=3424] It's a joy to have or to be -- have the privilege of being here.
[time=3429] I want you to know I shared this in the opening.
[time=3431] I love this ministry.
[time=3432] I love the school.
[time=3434] I love the lives that are touched and the lives that have been changed.
[time=3439] Brookside and Blackhawk do have a kindred spirit.
[time=3443] Thanks for having me.
[time=3444] We're doing the work of the Lord together.
[time=3447] Let's keep it up.
[time=3448] Let's stand for him.
[time=3450] Let's not get caught in the minefields.
[time=3453] Let's stand together and we'll pray.
[time=3460] Father, thank you for this day.
[time=3461] It is a joy to see old friends and new friends, meet new friends,
[time=3467] to just have an opportunity to share God's word with this church, this congregation.
[time=3474] Father, I pray that Pastor Kelly has had a good day at Brookside Church.
[time=3480] I know that our people have been blessed in all of our services this morning, as he has communicated your word.
[time=3487] And now Father, I just pray that you'll give us that desire, that intention,
[time=3493] and that our intention will be that we're never going to allow ourselves
[time=3500] to unlock it caught and snared and trapped.
[time=3504] Father, we have feet of clay and we can stumble and we can fall.
[time=3507] But may our intention each and every day be to walk in obedience and walk in purity and to walk in integrity and honesty and to do what you have called us to do, build your kingdom, further your kingdom, and made this church and Brookside Church
[time=3523] and every church that believes what we believe,
[time=3529] be churches in this city that are moving ahead and changing lives.
[time=3533] Thanks, God, for the privilege of serving you in Christ's name. Amen.
