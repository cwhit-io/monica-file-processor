[time=30] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=63] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=70] [MUSIC]
[time=75] Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=83] [MUSIC]
[time=91] Teaching them to observe all I have to command you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=98] [MUSIC]
[time=102] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=116] God's story, scene one, the Genesis.
[time=120] Or God help us, we've messed up already.
[time=126] In the beginning there was nothing but God, and so God spoke, and there was light.
[time=132] Over the course of seven days God created all things.
[time=136] The earth, animals, fish, the entire universe.
[time=145] And finally a man created to be like himself.
[time=153] Not bad!
[time=156] But God saw that the man was lonely, and so he created a woman to be his companion.
[time=162] Not bad!
[time=165] Everything was perfect.
[time=167] God had provided the man and the woman everything they needed, and they were in a relationship with him just as he planned.
[time=173] Until one day.
[time=176] [laughter] Hey, girlfriend!
[time=179] Who, me?
[time=180] No, I'm talking to the other only woman on the planet.
[time=183] Yes, you!
[time=184] Oh, what's up?
[time=186] Well, I was just wondering, you and that dude you hang out with, you seem to have a pretty good around here, but you never eat from this tree here.
[time=194] What's up with that?
[time=195] Oh, well, God has given us just one rule, that we cannot eat from that tree.
[time=200] He says, "If we do, then we die." Oh, please, get out of town.
[time=204] For eating a piece of fruit, you won't die.
[time=207] Are you telling me you have the run of the whole world here, and you're afraid of eating one little-- I am not afraid.
[time=213] I'm just-- [laughter] I am not a chicken!
[time=218] Mm-hmm!
[time=219] What?
[time=220] So, prove it.
[time=224] Don't!
[time=229] Hey, Eve, what's going on?
[time=230] Man, I am starving.
[time=231] Have you got anything to eat around here?
[time=233] Thanks.
[time=234] Don't!
[time=239] They had broken the one rule that God had given them, and as a result, messed up a perfect relationship with the perfect God.
[time=246] They were banished from the Garden of Eden, and had to spend their days laboring for the food that it once been provided for them.
[time=251] Time passed, and Adam and Eve had two sons.
[time=254] Abel was a shepherd.
[time=255] Howdy.
[time=256] And Cain was a farmer.
[time=259] Yee-haw.
[time=260] Whoo!
[time=263] We, my herdster, hasn't looked good lately.
[time=266] Nice and fat and healthy like.
[time=269] And I just have God to thank for that.
[time=272] I think I'll make him an offering of my best sheep.
[time=276] That'll be sure to please him.
[time=279] Yeah, yeah.
[time=280] My crops are just great, too.
[time=282] I just love working out in the hot sun all day.
[time=287] Thanks, God.
[time=289] Abel gave him some of my crops as an offering, too.
[time=293] Yeah, that's sure to please him.
[time=295] What are you looking at?
[time=296] I'm not going to give him my best stuff.
[time=298] God was pleased with Abel's sincere offering of his best sheep.
[time=302] But Cain, well, not so much.
[time=305] What?
[time=306] God said to Cain, "Why are you angry?
[time=308] You need to get that stuff under control before it leads you to sin." Yeah, yeah.
[time=312] I'll work on it, but get that noise.
[time=315] Hey, Abel.
[time=317] I've been meaning to show you something out in the field.
[time=320] What's that?
[time=321] You know, this is the thing.
[time=323] Oh!
[time=324] And so Cain killed Abel, and the first murder had been committed.
[time=328] From then on, things didn't get much better.
[time=330] Man continued to get more and more evil and grow further and further apart from God.
[time=334] And that relationship that God once had with his people, his very reason for creating them was long gone.
[time=341] So God decided to start over.
[time=343] He brought a flood on the earth, destroying everyone in it.
[time=346] Except one man's family, whom he shut into a boat with two of every animal.
[time=352] They were just wishing they were dead from the smell!
[time=356] Noah's family was safe from the flood and got busy repopulating the earth.
[time=360] Scene two, the promise.
[time=362] Time passed, and even though God had shown with a flood that he met business, most people ignored him and continued to sin.
[time=368] But a few people really tried to follow him.
[time=371] One such person was a man named...
[time=373] Hey, Braheb.
[time=374] What? What's going on? Who's there?
[time=376] It's me, God.
[time=378] Oi! I don't believe it!
[time=380] God is talking to me? What have I done that you would honor me?
[time=383] You have obeyed me, and so I make this promise to you.
[time=386] I will give you more descendants from the stars and the sky.
[time=389] Or make a nation of people out of you, and they will be my people.
[time=392] Oh, God, this is wonderful, but where am I going to put all the people?
[time=396] I mean, we just have this one better moment.
[time=398] I will give you a land of your own.
[time=400] I will show you a wonderful land that you will give to your descendants.
[time=403] You will defeat all those who live in this land, if you trust and obey me.
[time=407] There will be a land flowing with milk and honey.
[time=411] Wow!
[time=413] Now go!
[time=414] And so the promise was made.
[time=416] A promise that would show God's faithfulness time and again, even though it would be a while before it actually happened.
[time=421] Time passed, and Abraham and Sarah gave birth to a son.
[time=424] God came to Abraham and told him to sacrifice Isaac to him as a test.
[time=428] Abraham was just about to go through with it when an angel stopped him.
[time=431] Abraham, stop!
[time=433] God just wanted to test your obedience to him.
[time=435] You're passed.
[time=437] Don't do that to me!
[time=442] More time passed, and Isaac had kids of his own, two sons, Jacob and Esau.
[time=447] Jacob and Esau had an argument over a trick that Jacob played on Esau.
[time=451] Fearing for his life, Jacob ran away to a place called Heron.
[time=454] Jacob eventually had twelve sons of his son, one of whom was named Joseph.
[time=459] The story of Joseph and his brothers is pretty well known, so we can kind of fast forward through some of this.
[time=464] Jacob loved Joseph the most and gave him a special colored coat.
[time=468] The brothers hated Joseph and sold him into slavery.
[time=471] Joseph worked for a guy named Potiphar, but got thrown into prison when Potiphar's wife hit on him.
[time=475] Pharaoh was disturbed by some weird dreams and heard of a guy in prison who could interpret dreams.
[time=480] Joseph told Pharaoh that his dreams meant there was a famine coming throughout Egypt, and in seven years there would be no food.
[time=485] Pharaoh put Joseph in charge of Egypt, and Joseph stockpiled food for the time of the famine, saving Egypt.
[time=490] Joseph's whole family joined him in Egypt during the famine.
[time=493] Years passed, and Joseph's family got larger and larger.
[time=496] This is where God's promise to Abraham began to come true.
[time=499] Remember, Abraham was Joseph's great-grandfather.
[time=502] Eventually Joseph died, but his family kept on getting larger and larger.
[time=509] A new Pharaoh came into power who didn't remember Joseph or liked the fact that all those Israelites were in Egypt.
[time=514] He enslaved them all, but they just kept on multiplying until they were about two million of them.
[time=518] Pharaoh decided to put an end to the Israelites once and for all.
[time=523] He decreed that any Hebrew boys during that time that were born would be put to death.
[time=528] It was at this time that Moses was born.
[time=533] Ta-da!
[time=535] Scene three, the Exodus, or enter Moses, exit us.
[time=543] Get it? Exodus?
[time=545] Okay, well, anyway, it was at this time that Moses was born.
[time=550] Okay, we're coming.
[time=554] Oh, sorry, it's coming.
[time=557] It was at this time that Moses was born.
[time=560] I'm Moses.
[time=562] Okay, here's the deal.
[time=563] I grew up as a prince, and I kind of killed a guy accidentally on purpose.
[time=567] And out of fear for my life, I fled to Midian.
[time=569] So, welcome to Midian Land of Mystery and Adventure and some of the finest merchandise this side of the Red Sea.
[time=578] Can I interest you in a...no thanks.
[time=581] So, I'm in Midian, I get married, I become a shepherd, and God speaks to me through a burning bush and tells me to go back to Egypt and tell the Pharaoh there to release all the Israelites.
[time=591] Ah, Moses, you must be joking.
[time=594] So here I am.
[time=595] I will never release your people.
[time=597] Tough luck, Pharaoh. God's going to bring his wrath upon you.
[time=601] And to make a long story short?
[time=602] Do it!
[time=603] He did.
[time=604] But the plagues begin, blood, in the Nile.
[time=608] Frogs, ribbit!
[time=611] Flies!
[time=612] Now!
[time=616] Dead livestock!
[time=620] Whew, weak!
[time=621] Boils!
[time=622] Hail!
[time=627] Lucas!
[time=633] Darkness!
[time=635] And finally, the death of every firstborn son in Egypt.
[time=639] Israelites, if we place the blood of a perfect lamb on our doorposts, the angel of death will pass over us when it comes and kills all the firstborn in Egypt.
[time=648] And he did.
[time=649] But, my son is dead.
[time=652] Go, Moses, take your people and go!
[time=656] For 130 years of slavery.
[time=659] Over!
[time=660] Did you hear that Israelites?
[time=661] We're free!
[time=662] Follow me!
[time=663] And everything was going great!
[time=665] We're following the lead!
[time=667] The lead!
[time=669] We're following the lead!
[time=671] And for about the first five minutes.
[time=674] Moses, why did you bring us this way?
[time=677] The Red Sea is blocking our escape.
[time=679] The Pharaohs changed his mind and his army is charging down on us.
[time=683] I wish I was in Egypt.
[time=685] I wish I never followed you.
[time=687] I wish I was dead.
[time=688] Enough whining.
[time=695] And so God allowed Moses to part the Red Sea leading the Israelites through on dry ground.
[time=704] But the Egyptians were destroyed as the water filled back in.
[time=708] Over that next year, many things happened as the Israelites wandered in the desert toward the land that God had promised Abraham, the land that had come to be known as the Promised Land.
[time=717] God gave them the Ten Commandments to obey.
[time=719] Here they are!
[time=720] Which they immediately began disobeying.
[time=722] Oi!
[time=723] They complained that they were hungry.
[time=725] We're hungry!
[time=727] So God gave them manna, which fell from the sky.
[time=730] They complained that they were thirsty.
[time=732] We're thirsty!
[time=733] So God gave them water from a rock.
[time=736] They got sick of manna.
[time=738] We don't like manna!
[time=740] So God provided quails for them to eat.
[time=743] Tastes like chicken!
[time=745] This is how it went for the year that it took to get to the Promised Land.
[time=750] The Israelites were disobedient and whiny, and God continued to forgive and provide, until at last they arrived at the Promised Land.
[time=757] Here it is.
[time=759] The Promised Land Israelites, the land flowing with milk and honey.
[time=763] Moses, does it have to be milk and honey?
[time=766] You see, I'm a little lactose intolerant, and I was quiet!
[time=769] No, I've sent spies in the land to tell us what we will find there.
[time=772] I am back.
[time=774] Well, what did you find?
[time=776] There are many groups of people living there already.
[time=779] What?
[time=780] And they are huge.
[time=781] What?
[time=782] They will make very dangerous enemies.
[time=784] Oh, this is great.
[time=787] We never get anything we want.
[time=789] I wish I was it either.
[time=790] I wish I never followed you.
[time=792] I wish I was dead.
[time=794] Enough whining.
[time=796] God parted the Red Sea, and let us walk through and dry land.
[time=799] And yet you, still whining at the plain.
[time=802] He gave us manna to eat, and water from a rock.
[time=805] And yet you, still refused to trust and believe in him.
[time=808] I've had it with you people.
[time=810] I'm not sure enough.
[time=812] You take?
[time=814] And so God, who had led the Israelites to the Promised Land, punished them.
[time=818] They were forced to one at the desert for the next 40 years.
[time=821] None of those who saw God's wonders in Egypt ever got to see the Promised Land.
[time=825] Oh, man!
[time=828] Including Moses.
[time=829] Oh, man!
[time=831] And to make a long story short.
[time=833] To it!
[time=834] 40 years passed.
[time=836] Scene 4 wandering in the desert.
[time=838] Or get off the next exit there.
[time=841] I've got sand in my shoe.
[time=843] Moses died, and God chose a new leader for the Israelites named Joshua.
[time=847] Hi there!
[time=849] Joshua was humble.
[time=851] Hi there.
[time=852] And led the Israelites.
[time=854] Israelites, well.
[time=855] At last it was time to re-enter the Promised Land.
[time=858] Joshua led the Israelites into the Promised Land, and this time they were ready to trust God and do this whole thing his way.
[time=864] Listen up Israelites.
[time=866] There are many people still living in this land who will try to stop us from going in.
[time=872] Didn't we make a reservation?
[time=874] Not so.
[time=875] Pay attention!
[time=877] Now, if we obey God, then we will have victory.
[time=881] But if we disobey, then we will have trouble.
[time=884] Come on!
[time=885] And that was the way it worked.
[time=887] When they obey God and did things his way, nobody could stop them.
[time=891] Yay!
[time=894] But when they let sin into the picture and disobey God, even the wimpiest of enemies beat them.
[time=901] And in this way they eventually took over most of Canaan, the Promised Land.
[time=905] When they disobeyed, they lost.
[time=911] Please!
[time=912] They want some.
[time=914] Yay!
[time=916] And they lost.
[time=919] Sometimes they just saw it.
[time=921] Yay!
[time=922] Hey!
[time=923] Geez.
[time=924] Where was I?
[time=927] Help?
[time=928] Anybody?
[time=929] Oh, hold on a second.
[time=931] Yeah.
[time=932] And in this way they eventually took over most of Canaan, the Promised Land.
[time=935] Okay.
[time=936] Thanks.
[time=937] And in this way they eventually took over most of Canaan, the Promised Land.
[time=941] Scene five, entering the Promised Land.
[time=944] Or?
[time=946] Lookin' honey, I thought he said elks and bunnies.
[time=953] Before his death, Joshua gave the Israelites some instructions.
[time=957] Come, come.
[time=960] I'm going to die soon.
[time=962] Die?
[time=963] I didn't even know he was sick.
[time=965] I'm not sick.
[time=966] I'm old.
[time=967] Now any other questions or can I finish right here before killing over?
[time=971] Thanks so much.
[time=972] Now, you must remember everything God has done after I'm gone.
[time=976] Continue to obey him.
[time=978] One thing he commands.
[time=979] Now that we possess almost all of Canaan, you must go around and continue to defeat the few remaining groups of people who are living there.
[time=986] Oh, do we have to?
[time=988] Yeah, yes schmutz is you do.
[time=990] But why?
[time=992] Because God knows what a bunch of schlamils you are.
[time=995] Schlamils!
[time=998] Schlamazels!
[time=1000] Hoss if after a corporation!
[time=1002] Yeah!
[time=1003] Now the people who are living on the outskirts of this land are still worshiping other gods.
[time=1010] He wants them gone so this land can be totally dedicated to him and you won't be tempted to worship other false gods.
[time=1016] Well, we won't.
[time=1017] Yeah, we promise.
[time=1019] Yeah, like I've never heard that before.
[time=1021] And so Joshua died.
[time=1024] And to make a long story short, today, the Israelites ignored gods to commands, to clear all the other people living in Canaan.
[time=1031] Scene six, the judges.
[time=1033] Or stop this ride.
[time=1036] Going in circles makes me sick.
[time=1039] The time of the judges was a tricky one for the Israelites.
[time=1045] They refused to obey God and clear out all the other people living in Canaan.
[time=1049] And because of this sin, more sin followed.
[time=1052] Soon they were marrying people they shouldn't have been marrying and following false gods.
[time=1056] They pretty much abandoned God, and God allowed them to be captured and taken prisoner by their enemies.
[time=1062] God help us!
[time=1063] We've been beaten and captured by our enemies!
[time=1068] Isn't this kind of our own fault?
[time=1071] You mean if we had cleared out the land like God had promised, none of this would have ever happened?
[time=1075] Yeah.
[time=1076] God help us!
[time=1077] We've been beaten and captured by our enemies!
[time=1080] And so God sent them a leader, a judge, to lead them to victory against the enemies who had captured them.
[time=1085] And this is how it went for 325 years.
[time=1089] The Israelites would follow and obey God, and He would bless them and give them victory over their enemies.
[time=1094] Judge!
[time=1096] But then they'd get kind of comfy, forget about God, and God would allow them to be beaten by their enemies.
[time=1102] Go away!
[time=1104] They'd cry out to God for help.
[time=1106] God help us!
[time=1107] We've been beaten and captured by our enemies!
[time=1109] And God would send a new judge to free them.
[time=1112] On and on it went like this.
[time=1116] Judge!
[time=1119] God help us!
[time=1121] We've been beaten and captured by our enemies!
[time=1125] Judge!
[time=1127] Oh my God!
[time=1129] God help us!
[time=1131] We've been beaten and captured by our enemies!
[time=1134] Judge!
[time=1136] We've been beaten and captured by our enemies!
[time=1139] Sorry?
[time=1143] Needless to say, they were caught in a terrible cycle of sin.
[time=1147] During this time a few people kept following God, no matter what.
[time=1150] People like Boaz, who was a simple rancher during this time, and Gideon, who was one of the judges, God sent to lead the Israelites to victory.
[time=1157] But as I said, the cycle of sin and disobedience continued for 325 years.
[time=1163] You may be wondering, where does it end?
[time=1166] Where does it end?
[time=1169] It ends with scene seven, the kings.
[time=1172] Or out of the frying pan and into the fire.
[time=1176] The last judge during this time was a guy named Samuel.
[time=1179] But when he retired, the Israelites started whining again.
[time=1183] We don't want to judge any more!
[time=1186] Yeah, we want a king!
[time=1188] The Philistines have a king!
[time=1190] The Amalekites have a king!
[time=1191] Why do we have a king?
[time=1193] We never get anything!
[time=1195] When they told us to Samuel, he was furious!
[time=1198] I'm furious!
[time=1199] Don't you people know what it would be like to have a king?
[time=1202] Why take your sons and daughters and make them serve him?
[time=1205] Taking care of his horses, biting in the army, cooking meals.
[time=1209] Why take your best lands, your best crops and the food that he grows there for himself?
[time=1213] He practically be his slaves.
[time=1216] Blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.
[time=1218] Whatever!
[time=1219] Read our lips!
[time=1220] We want a king and we want a man!
[time=1223] So God gave them a king.
[time=1225] Woo!
[time=1226] He knew that this would not solve everything, but he saw that they would have to learn that the hard way.
[time=1232] During this time, there were many kings.
[time=1234] First, King Saul.
[time=1236] King Saul was a pretty good king for a while, but then he slipped into sin and disobedience.
[time=1240] And so God replaced him with David.
[time=1243] Uh, buh-bye.
[time=1244] What?
[time=1245] You heard me?
[time=1246] Whatever.
[time=1247] David was a very good king.
[time=1250] And during his rule, the Israelites finally seemed to be on track, following God and being obedient.
[time=1255] Don't get me wrong.
[time=1256] David had his share of mess-ups.
[time=1258] Like the famous Bathsheba incident.
[time=1261] Well, do we have to bring that up?
[time=1263] But overall, David had a great rule and was known for being a man after God's own heart.
[time=1268] David set up the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
[time=1271] And God promised David that his son would be the one to build a temple, and that David's family would rule forever.
[time=1276] Yes.
[time=1277] So David died.
[time=1278] But I just got here.
[time=1280] So David dies.
[time=1283] Whatever.
[time=1287] And Solomon became king.
[time=1289] Solomon was a great king and did build the temple.
[time=1292] Go, Solomon.
[time=1293] It's your birthday.
[time=1294] We got a party.
[time=1295] Like it's your birthday.
[time=1296] But in the end, he blew it all.
[time=1301] By disobeying God and worshiping other false gods, Solomon set off a chain reaction.
[time=1306] Chain reaction in the house.
[time=1310] That led to Israel's ruin.
[time=1315] I did all that.
[time=1317] Yeah.
[time=1318] Oh, man.
[time=1320] After Solomon's death, a kind of civil war broke out between the north and the south of Israel.
[time=1325] Northern Israel is the best southern Israel second.
[time=1329] Whoo!
[time=1330] Go north.
[time=1331] Oh, Kragerstein.
[time=1333] Do you know what time it is?
[time=1335] No, Ariana Stein.
[time=1336] What time is it?
[time=1337] It's totally time for the perfect cheer.
[time=1339] You are so right.
[time=1341] Okay.
[time=1345] Who's that Israelite?
[time=1346] Who's the best?
[time=1347] It's me.
[time=1349] I said who's that Israelite?
[time=1350] Who's the best?
[time=1351] It's me.
[time=1353] Uh huh.
[time=1361] Northern Israel.
[time=1362] We don't want to hear it.
[time=1363] The coolest shoes come from the south.
[time=1373] Whoo!
[time=1374] Go southern Israel.
[time=1376] Whoo!
[time=1377] You did so good.
[time=1378] You were so good.
[time=1381] Israel was split as a result of Solomon's sin just as God had warned.
[time=1385] Both kingdoms the north.
[time=1387] Go north.
[time=1388] And the south.
[time=1389] So spirit rocks.
[time=1391] Whoo!
[time=1392] We're led by king after king after king.
[time=1395] Almost all bad kings.
[time=1397] Further and further from God the nation.
[time=1399] Oh wait a minute.
[time=1401] Yes Solomon.
[time=1403] What about God's promise to my dad that our family would rule forever and ever?
[time=1407] How about that?
[time=1409] It's Jesus.
[time=1411] Jesus is the king from your family who will rule forever.
[time=1414] Jesus.
[time=1415] I'm getting to it.
[time=1416] Do you mind?
[time=1417] I mean you're supposed to be dead at this point anyway.
[time=1419] Oh yeah.
[time=1420] Sorry.
[time=1421] Where was I?
[time=1423] Further and further.
[time=1425] Thank you.
[time=1427] Further and further from God the nation of Israel grew.
[time=1430] Until scene eight the exile.
[time=1432] Or I'll be back.
[time=1438] During the time of the kings God had sent prophets to warn the people.
[time=1441] These were men sent by God to speak for him warning people away from sin.
[time=1446] Please folks.
[time=1447] Back away from the sin.
[time=1448] There's nothing to see here.
[time=1450] I'm a trained professional.
[time=1451] I know what I'm doing.
[time=1453] Back away from the sin and back to your obedient life citizens.
[time=1457] But no dice.
[time=1458] I mean nothing worked.
[time=1459] So God brought the ruin on Israel that he told Solomon he would.
[time=1463] Northern Israel was attacked by a country called Assyria.
[time=1465] They were captured and hauled off to Assyria as slaves and servants.
[time=1469] Southern Israel now called Judah.
[time=1471] Who's the coolest of countries?
[time=1476] Do you mind?
[time=1479] Southern spirit rocks.
[time=1485] Judah was attacked by a country called Babylon.
[time=1488] They too were captured and hauled off to Babylon as slaves and servants.
[time=1492] During this time lots of interesting stuff happened.
[time=1495] In the news today a man named Isaiah claiming to be a prophet of God.
[time=1499] Announced there would be coming a day soon where God would be sending a deliverer.
[time=1503] The man said and I quote unto us a child will be born unto us a son will be given.
[time=1508] And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[time=1514] Unquote.
[time=1515] For more on the story join us at 5.
[time=1519] Apparently three young men had rock, fish, act, and a bubblegum were thrown into the fiery
[time=1526] furnace today and survived.
[time=1529] More at 11.
[time=1530] In a spectacular story a man named Daniel was thrown into a den of hungry lions and survives.
[time=1536] That another story is coming up at 5 o'clock.
[time=1539] In today's top story Queen Esther, Queen of Persia and wife of King Xerxes, saved all the Jews in Persia from total annihilation.
[time=1548] Reports confirmed that 50,000 Jews returned to the city of Jerusalem today.
[time=1553] These Jews and their families were exiled 70 years ago by Babylon.
[time=1557] And now the first two have returned to their homeland.
[time=1560] A spokesman for the Israelites confirmed that they do plan to rebuild the temple, which was destroyed in the Babylonian attack 70 years ago.
[time=1567] The rest of the city lies in ruins and that's the way it was.
[time=1573] And so it went.
[time=1574] Time passed and to make a long story short.
[time=1576] Two late.
[time=1577] Seven years after they were taken captive, the first of them began to make their way home.
[time=1582] There was a man named Nehemiah who with the help of King Arctic Xerxes rallied the Jews to begin rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem.
[time=1590] Okay, everybody, now listen to me.
[time=1592] We are going to rebuild this wall and God is really going to be honored.
[time=1596] The city will be strong and all God's people will be free to return at last.
[time=1600] And so the Jewish people worked and worked.
[time=1603] Oh, real!
[time=1610] Oh!
[time=1611] Around the clock they worked.
[time=1613] They faced much opposition.
[time=1615] Enemies of the Jews tried to stop them as they carried their swords in one hand and their tools in the other.
[time=1621] Wrong hand, Charlie.
[time=1623] The other hand's got your hammer in it.
[time=1625] There you go.
[time=1627] But despite the opposition they faced, they rebuilt the entire wall around the city of Jerusalem in 52 days.
[time=1633] Woo-hoo!
[time=1635] During the rebuilding of the walls, Nehemiah became governor and led the people in an amazing thing.
[time=1640] The time has come, my friends, to recommit ourselves to God and start following His ways.
[time=1645] We've returned to the Promised Land, the land that was promised to Abraham.
[time=1649] God has brought us home.
[time=1651] Now we must return to Him and being His people and living His way.
[time=1655] And in a way that happened.
[time=1657] The people recommitted themselves to God and living in His ways for the first time in many years.
[time=1661] They didn't get it perfect, but it was closer than it had been in a long time.
[time=1666] Many years passed, 400 to be exact.
[time=1669] Not much of what happened during this time was recorded.
[time=1672] At that time Rome was traveling the world conquering cities.
[time=1675] They came in and took over Jerusalem.
[time=1677] They didn't enslave the Jews, but they did put a Roman king over them, and he ruled.
[time=1681] His name was Herod.
[time=1683] Not much else happened during that time.
[time=1685] The Jews went about their lives, as did the rest of the world.
[time=1688] Trying to follow God, but still not knowing what it was like to be in that perfect relationship with Him.
[time=1692] The way it was created in the beginning.
[time=1694] Until one silent night.
[time=1696] The cry of a newborn baby was heard from the depths of a filthy stable.
[time=1700] But that is the rest of the story.
[time=1703] After all, a good writer always leaves Rome for a sequel.
[time=1708] Amazing.
[time=1720] That's great stuff.
[time=1723] I hope you realize how much time and effort that took.
[time=1726] Give those four a big, big round of applause.
[time=1730] That was Lauren, and Amy, and Tom, and Jared.
[time=1743] What a great, great, and what a fun time just looking back over this history of the OT.
[time=1750] Again, part of the one story, part of the story of God's redemptive work, this Word of God that we love and are so grateful for.
[time=1760] And while we want to, in a way, and in a sense, emphasize its continuity.
[time=1766] Because we believe that that's there.
[time=1768] There are some unique things about the Old Testament.
[time=1771] Unique things worth noting, and we'll hopefully touch on several of those in the weeks to come as we dive into Joshua.
[time=1778] Mitch, maybe one thing that comes to your mind is you think about the unique role that the Old Testament plays.
[time=1784] My uncle, growing up in Sunday school class, you should tell us that you have to fix your tie.
[time=1790] Thank you.
[time=1791] Now can we do a cheer together?
[time=1795] No.
[time=1797] He used to say you could open up your Bible to where the Old Testament and the New Testament meet, and you could put a cross.
[time=1802] And that cross sheds light, and the Old Testament is a foreshadowing of the cross.
[time=1810] And that cross sheds light on the new, so the new is concealed in the old, the old is revealed in the new.
[time=1818] And I think all of the promises in the old you see are fulfilled in Christ.
[time=1824] And so I have a theology that all scripture points to Christ.
[time=1828] That's really true, and we love the Old Testament, obviously it's God's Word.
[time=1833] But we do need to be discerning about how we apply the promises in the Old Testament, what we learn about those,
[time=1842] and how they really get lived out in our lives.
[time=1845] Some people, I think, misappropriately teach that there are some blessings that were given to the nation of Israel.
[time=1853] And I believe they were conditional, I believe they were about time and space at that time, and they received blessings that were incredible,
[time=1862] because God used them as exposing himself through the light that he shed there in the nation of Israel.
[time=1870] And sometimes I think people preach, sometimes we want to apply, promises that were conditional for them to us,
[time=1878] so that we'll have that kind of blessing, we have to be really discerning, because a lot of the Old Testament is about them specifically in that time and in that space.
[time=1889] Well, we are going to enjoy, and I think as a family, our prayer and our hope is that we'll benefit from this study in the book of Joshua.
[time=1899] As you were watching what the drama team did there, I think you'll remember back to Joshua, it's a little before halfway,
[time=1906] and it was an amazing time in the life of God's people, and he uses Joshua in an amazing way.
[time=1912] And we will, over the next 10 to 12 weeks or so, we're not quite sure how it's all going to play out,
[time=1918] but our commitment is to just take and select many of the narratives as the book of Joshua progresses,
[time=1924] and to teach from those narratives and apply the great truth that is there for you and I to see.
[time=1931] And Joshua is an amazing study, and so our hope is that you'll join us.
[time=1935] We'll break for a couple, two, three weeks right there around Palm Sunday and Easter, and even Sunday after Easter to do some special things,
[time=1943] and then we'll jump right back in to our study of Joshua.
[time=1946] Hey, let me just share with you, if I can, a couple of just interesting things about the book of Joshua itself,
[time=1952] before Mitch kind of begins to develop for you this morning a theme that we have seen there in the book,
[time=1959] a theme that will kind of run throughout most of our study.
[time=1962] Let me give you a few things about Joshua to just write down, get out of pen, if you will, write a couple of these things down, just some insights, some things you may not have known, some things you may have heard at one time.
[time=1973] First of all, Joshua is, and I think this is going to come up on the screen for you, Joshua is the first of 12 historical books.
[time=1981] The Old Testament, if I'm remembering right, is divided into basically four sections of books.
[time=1987] You have the Pentateuch, which is the first five books of the Old Testament.
[time=1991] It is in the Pentateuch that we find the Torah, that's where God's law is revealed, and the Pentateuch represents the first section of the Old Testament.
[time=2000] Then comes the historical books, 12 of them, and Joshua you will find is the first of the 12 historical books.
[time=2008] I believe following the historical books, you'll come across what's known as the poetical books, Psalms and Proverbs and things of that nature,
[time=2016] Song of Solomon's, the poetical books, and then the Old Testament concludes with what is known as the prophetical writings or the prophetical books.
[time=2024] What we have here in this study of Joshua is the first of the 12 historical books.
[time=2030] First part of Joshua, you can write down chapters 1 to 12.
[time=2034] The first 12 chapters of Joshua describe the seven-year conquest of the land.
[time=2040] Remember that, the promised land, this place that God had prepared, this place that God had promised.
[time=2048] The first 12 chapters describe the conquest of that land, and then the second half of Joshua, chapters 13 to 24,
[time=2056] describes and tells the story of how that land was settled among the 12 tribes.
[time=2062] Lastly, and I want you to catch this, we would want you to sense this, through three military campaigns.
[time=2067] This is a very, very important lesson, and it may military campaigns.
[time=2073] That might kind of take you and lead you to think, gosh, this doesn't apply to me, but please read through this and understand the great truth here.
[time=2080] Through three military campaigns involving more than 30 enemy armies, the people of Israel learn a crucial lesson under Joshua's capable leadership.
[time=2090] You can see it there, victory comes through faith in God and obedience to his word rather than military might or numerical or strategic superiority.
[time=2103] And I want you just to look at that, and I want you to be reminded this morning, my friends, that victory, the wind, you and I following and lives that are led in the way that God, this is about fundamentally.
[time=2119] And it has always been about, and it will continue to be about your willingness.
[time=2125] Look what it says right there, through faith in God, a deep and abiding and growing faith in him, and a willingness to obey his word.
[time=2136] That is where we find, that is where you experience, that is where we as the family of God are able to realize all that he has for us.
[time=2146] It isn't about numbers so much, it isn't about the external strength that we may want to make it about, it's about your heart and mind and a trusting and an obeying of him.
[time=2157] Those are just some things you see as you take an initial look at the book of Joshua.
[time=2162] Like I said, Mitch is going to explain to you now a little bit more about Joshua himself and a theme, a really, really important theme that we see developing in the pages of Scripture there in that book.
[time=2173] Well today we're discussing becoming a person of promise, becoming a person of promise.
[time=2180] How many people here raise your hand if you've either broken a promise or you've had a promise broken to you, raise your hand, raise them up high.
[time=2189] Now look around, those around you don't have their hands up because that's what someone in denial looks like.
[time=2195] We're not very good at keeping our promises, but God keeps his.
[time=2201] And becoming a person of promise, emphasis on becoming for a minute.
[time=2206] We looked at the first five books and all they had to say about Joshua before we get to the book of Joshua and it's really, really interesting.
[time=2214] Becoming.
[time=2216] Joshua will first see as a military commander.
[time=2219] And he's got this hard after God and he gets elevated and he gets elevated to becoming Moses's aide and he serves Moses and then probably goes up another notch.
[time=2230] It looks like when they send the spies into the promised land into Canaan and he might have been a tribal leader or something like that.
[time=2237] And then Joshua finally is commissioned as Moses's successor to lead everybody right before we get to the book of Joshua.
[time=2246] So becoming, it definitely appears to be a process.
[time=2250] And then a person of promise.
[time=2252] A promise literally means if you want to write this down, to send forth.
[time=2257] To send forth.
[time=2259] Pro means forth and M-I-S-E comes for Latin for to send.
[time=2264] So here's this idea.
[time=2266] That this message comes vertically from God and I need to trust it.
[time=2272] However, I also need to trust them enough to obey horizontally in relationships.
[time=2280] I trust the message.
[time=2282] I trust the message vertically.
[time=2285] And I obey horizontally in relationships if you want to write it down.
[time=2290] So just draw on your paper or wherever you're taking notes across.
[time=2294] Across.
[time=2296] Because a person of promise lives at the crossroads.
[time=2300] Where the vertical intersects with the horizontal.
[time=2303] Let me say it again.
[time=2305] A person of promise lives at the crossroads.
[time=2309] Where the vertical intersects with the horizontal will vertical trust in the message, in the messenger, in God.
[time=2317] Meats.
[time=2319] Horizontal obedience in relationships with others.
[time=2323] And we see that in the life of Joshua and it's amazing.
[time=2327] And we need it.
[time=2329] We need it.
[time=2330] Because we're not very good at keeping our promises.
[time=2334] A husband and a wife vow before God to be faithful to each other.
[time=2339] And one of them checks out.
[time=2340] He doesn't want to obey horizontally what he committed vertically to do anymore.
[time=2344] A dad promises a sign on his 12th birthday.
[time=2347] He's going to go fishing with him and he doesn't come home.
[time=2350] The vertical message where he was prompted by God didn't happen horizontally in obedience in relationships.
[time=2355] But what we see is three things that the Bible talks about.
[time=2359] Joshua living in the crossroads of where the vertical meets the horizontal where trust meets obedience.
[time=2366] And these three things if you want to write them down.
[time=2369] Three traits to becoming a person of promise.
[time=2371] The first one is that you follow God wholeheartedly.
[time=2374] A person of promise follows God wholeheartedly or fully surrenders.
[time=2379] The second is that a person of promise leads courageously.
[time=2384] And we're going to unpack that a little bit on that means it might mean something a little different than what you're thinking right now.
[time=2388] And third, a person of promise leads wisely.
[time=2393] Three traits to becoming a person of promise.
[time=2396] Joshua is a person of promise who followed God wholeheartedly.
[time=2403] One of the things that was depicted up here was the 12 spies that were sent out by Moses to check out the promised land.
[time=2413] There were 12 spies that went out, a leader from each of the 12 tribes of Israel.
[time=2419] Ten came back responding absolutely naturally to what they found there.
[time=2427] There's really nothing unusual about the ten who said the land's big, the fruit's big, and the enemy is big.
[time=2439] They saw the Nephilim there, the sons of Anak.
[time=2443] The Bible's pretty clear that there were some giants around where they came from has really debated a lot.
[time=2449] You can study that, look back in numbers, you'll see that actually in Genesis.
[time=2453] And what we find out is there are these really big people that the ten spies came back and said,
[time=2459] "I'm afraid of them." And all they did was respond the way I would respond naturally.
[time=2468] But Caleb and Joshua, they said, "No, we can take them because they had a vertical relationship with their God that placed their trust in his ability to conquer the enemy."
[time=2485] And then they were willing to apply what they knew to be true as their minds had been renewed, Romans 12.
[time=2492] If your mind is renewed and you have a vertical relationship that depends on his strength, then you can do the unnatural, the supernatural.
[time=2501] Defeating that enemy was going to be a supernatural deal, and they knew that.
[time=2505] Let's look at Numbers, chapter 32, just to close here on that part.
[time=2510] It says, we're talking about the other ten spies, and it says, except the son of Jafuna, the Kinazite, and Joshua, the son of none, for they followed the Lord fully.
[time=2525] In the United States, wholeheartedly. That's where we got that.
[time=2531] So God sends a vertical message, and they trust the vertical message.
[time=2535] Joshua and Caleb were willing to trust it in obedience, horizontally, in relationships.
[time=2540] And we just want to ask today, what about you?
[time=2543] Do you live at the crossroads of the vertical and horizontal?
[time=2548] Do you follow God wholeheartedly when he prompts you with the Spirit?
[time=2555] And he tells you to move.
[time=2559] Do you trust him enough that you'll live it out, horizontally, in relationships, in obedience?
[time=2565] One of the things I enjoy about being a pastor is one of the things that's so hard about being a pastor,
[time=2578] and that is that you all, so many of you, have allowed me and us.
[time=2585] You've allowed us into your lives.
[time=2588] You've allowed us to come and stand by you and be with you in the midst of life.
[time=2594] And I just know from even just recent days, just things that have transpired in situations that we've found ourselves in with many of you,
[time=2605] I understand that you face a large enemy.
[time=2611] Yes, we understand sitting here today that there is a wholeheartedness that is being called out of you,
[time=2618] that comes in the face of great challenge.
[time=2623] And so we want to just make sure that you understand that while we are so willing and so ready to proclaim to you this morning,
[time=2633] that people of promise will follow God wholeheartedly.
[time=2636] We say that with an understanding of how challenging that can be, and yet we believe wholeheartedly,
[time=2643] that in him there is great strength in that vertical relationship that Mitchell described, there is great opportunity for you and I to very humbly follow him in obedience.
[time=2654] And so we just say again to each of you, whatever it is you might be facing, whatever challenge you may be in the midst of,
[time=2662] be wholehearted, be fully his and allow us and allow those in relationship with you to come alongside
[time=2671] and provide you the reminder and the push and the nudge and the prayer and the encouragement that you need.
[time=2677] But let's each of us be wholehearted in our willingness to follow.
[time=2682] Secondly, you see as you study in the first five books of the Bible there, in the Pentateuch, you learn a lot about Joshua.
[time=2690] Another thing we come across is that he not only follows God with a whole heart, but he is courageous in his leadership. He leads courageously.
[time=2700] And I want to read this to you if I can, turning your Bibles to Deuteronomy 31.
[time=2704] Would you do that? Deuteronomy 31, I want to read this to you and I want to just get you to, maybe this morning focus in on something that maybe there, I don't know, there are times where I feel like we let this get away from us, if nowhere else in our thinking.
[time=2719] Look what it says here in Deuteronomy 31 verse 7.
[time=2722] Then Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all of Israel,
[time=2729] just get that picture there for a moment.
[time=2731] Here Moses calls Joshua, all of the people are gathered.
[time=2735] And Moses says, Moses exhorts, Moses kind of lays this out for Joshua right there in the presence of all the people.
[time=2742] He says Joshua, be strong and courageous for you shall go with this people into the land
[time=2750] which the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall give it to them as an inheritance.
[time=2758] He's calling Joshua there to be a courageous leader.
[time=2762] And I want you to think about this just for a moment.
[time=2764] Before you look at verse 8, just think with me.
[time=2766] Oftentimes when we hear the phrase or oftentimes when we speak the phrase, courageous leadership.
[time=2774] Be a courageous leader.
[time=2776] Be a leader who exhibits courage.
[time=2778] Oftentimes in our minds or in our hearts we oftentimes immediately begin to think about
[time=2784] that something down deep in us that we muster and call forth to the surface in us
[time=2790] that allows us to walk forward and move with great strength and boldness.
[time=2795] And I understand that there's a sense of that, but I really, really want you this morning to be reminded.
[time=2803] And I want you to see from the pages of Scripture where this courage comes from,
[time=2809] where the courageous in courageous leadership, whatever it is you're leading,
[time=2815] whoever it is you're to influence, whatever it is you are to do, see this morning where this courage is to emanate from.
[time=2823] And there you have it in verse 8.
[time=2825] The Lord, listen, the Lord is the one who goes ahead of you.
[time=2831] You see that?
[time=2832] I want every one of you this morning to realize that.
[time=2835] The Lord is the one in whatever it is you're facing and whatever road it is that you're being called to walk down.
[time=2842] Remember your courage comes from the fact that in relationship with him, he is the one who goes ahead of you.
[time=2849] He will be with you.
[time=2851] He will not fail you or forsake you.
[time=2855] Do not fear or be dismayed.
[time=2857] Be encouraged because of this God that you serve, because of his great love for you, because of his unending commitment to you, because he has promised to go ahead of you.
[time=2869] In that, in him you find great courage.
[time=2874] In him you find great strength.
[time=2877] This is not something that you pull up from deep within you.
[time=2881] This is something that is there by virtue of his grace and his mercy and his love for you.
[time=2886] And him, Christ in you gives you courage to lead,
[time=2894] to go forward, to influence, to come alongside a middle schooler in your home
[time=2900] who needs some help in your business with your marriage
[time=2906] and a difficult relationship wherever it is God is calling you to influence.
[time=2911] You do it wholeheartedly and he says do it with courage.
[time=2916] The courage that comes because I, he says I am in you.
[time=2920] I go before you.
[time=2921] Do not fear.
[time=2922] Do not be dismayed.
[time=2923] I will never forsake you.
[time=2926] Lead courageously.
[time=2927] And then thirdly, Mitchell, explain that one to you.
[time=2932] A person of promise follows God wholeheartedly, a person of promise leads courageously, and a person of promise leads wisely.
[time=2940] All of these were vertical trust meets horizontal obedience in relationships.
[time=2946] Look at Deuteronomy 34.9, it says that Joshua was filled with something unique.
[time=2951] Now Joshua the son of none was filled with the spirit of wisdom.
[time=2955] For Moses had laid hands on him and the sons of Israel listened to him
[time=2961] and it as the Lord had commanded Moses.
[time=2964] So this wisdom that was commissioned for the spirit into, into Joshua was then lived out
[time=2973] in relationships and horizontal obedience and people listened to him.
[time=2977] But we need to see where it came from.
[time=2979] Let's look at another verse here.
[time=2981] I think it's in Numbers.
[time=2985] Is it?
[time=2990] Numbers 27, 18 through 23.
[time=2992] There's a little package here that tells us how this came about.
[time=2995] In Numbers 27, 18 it says, so the Lord said to Moses, take Joshua the son of man, the son of none, a man in whom is the spirit, capital S, this breath of God.
[time=3007] Ruah, this breath of God and layer hand on him.
[time=3012] And then Moses lives it out horizontally.
[time=3015] Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him just as the Lord had spoken through Moses.
[time=3019] Vertical and horizontal intersection.
[time=3022] The crossroads of where vertical trust meets horizontal obedience and relationships.
[time=3028] You know wisdom, if you want to write this down, wisdom is God's heart intersecting with street smarts.
[time=3037] It's this vertical intersecting with the horizontal.
[time=3040] It's God's heart vertically intersecting with street smarts.
[time=3044] So I know horizontally what to do in every circumstance in my life.
[time=3047] It's the application of God's heart to my circumstances.
[time=3050] That's what wisdom is, hokama in Hebrew.
[time=3053] In fact, Christ is called the wisdom of God in 1 Corinthians 1, 24.
[time=3059] And we need to lead wisely.
[time=3061] And that's how people listen because we know how the vertical meets the horizontal.
[time=3066] We become a person of promise.
[time=3068] And you think about, well, where did this come from?
[time=3071] This is really cool.
[time=3073] This is a verse that not many people want to talk about much, but as far as commentaries go, but man, it struck me.
[time=3079] And when we talked about it, it struck us uniquely.
[time=3081] And I wanted you to see this.
[time=3083] It's in Exodus 3311.
[time=3086] Exodus 3311.
[time=3087] Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face.
[time=3092] Just as a man speaks to his friend.
[time=3095] It's like this.
[time=3097] When Moses returned to the campus servant, Joshua, the son of Nana, a young man, would not depart from the tent.
[time=3106] That is so powerful.
[time=3108] It's possible.
[time=3110] It's possible that Joshua really needed to be on his knees and to get a lot of strength
[time=3118] from the Lord in preparation for what he was called to do.
[time=3121] Because you know what it says, Joshua was a servant of Moses for more than 40 years.
[time=3130] Joshua served God by serving Moses.
[time=3133] And he may need to stay there in order to get the strength to serve a person because it's hard to serve people.
[time=3140] It's really hard.
[time=3142] And the Bible says that when Moses died, it says Moses, servant of the Lord died.
[time=3150] Servant of the Lord, Deuteronomy, the end of the book.
[time=3153] And then it says, and Joshua, son of Nana, servant of Moses became the leader of the nation of Israel.
[time=3162] And in the first chapter of Joshua, it calls him Joshua, son of Nana, servant of Moses.
[time=3168] Because he served Moses the ways we're talking about here.
[time=3172] And then at the end of the book of Joshua, it says Joshua, son of Nana, servant of the Lord.
[time=3179] I love that.
[time=3182] I know it's like to serve people.
[time=3184] It's been hard sometimes.
[time=3186] I know what it's like for people to serve me.
[time=3188] It's really hard sometimes.
[time=3190] We need that vertical relationship in order to do that.
[time=3194] I love him staying in the tent after Moses left.
[time=3198] And Proverbs 1-7 says, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[time=3201] Oh, right there is where it was happening.
[time=3204] You know, the opposite of wisdom is foolishness.
[time=3206] It would be probably the horizontal at the expense of the vertical.
[time=3210] Street smarts without God's heart.
[time=3212] It's foolish.
[time=3213] Actually, you know what?
[time=3214] God's heart at the expense of street smarts.
[time=3216] It ain't going to happen either if you're not going to live it out horizontally.
[time=3220] It's foolishness.
[time=3221] And one of the things I've studied kind of interesting is there's this progression of foolishness.
[time=3225] A progression of fools in the Bible on how my heart slowly gets harder and harder and harder and harder.
[time=3231] From what cement to heart cement.
[time=3235] So what now what?
[time=3237] Three traits of becoming a person of promise.
[time=3241] It follows God wholeheartedly, leads courageously, leads wisely, lives where the vertical meets the horizontal.
[time=3249] The sweet spot.
[time=3251] But what about this?
[time=3254] What would you say if you knew that the New Testament in Hebrews 11 said, you know what?
[time=3259] All these people, the Old Testament, didn't really get the good promise.
[time=3264] There was something better to come.
[time=3266] And Romans 15, 8 says, Christ is the promise.
[time=3271] Christ is the promise.
[time=3273] And it goes on, Paul writes in Galatians that those who fully surrender their lives to God, those who follow God wholeheartedly, receive the promise of Christ.
[time=3284] And that's eternal and abundant life here and now.
[time=3287] He writes in 2 Corinthians 1, 20, I think.
[time=3290] All of God's promise in Christ are yes and amen.
[time=3296] And then he says this in Ephesians.
[time=3298] He said, a person of promise who is in Christ receives the Holy Spirit, a seal of the promise, the promised one.
[time=3306] And I lead by the power of the Holy Spirit in my life when I'm in Christ.
[time=3311] A person of promise where the vertical and the horizontal intersect.
[time=3315] Living at the crossroads, the sweet spot of where I trust and I obey.
[time=3319] And I lead wisely.
[time=3321] Wisdom comes from God.
[time=3323] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[time=3325] The Bible tells us throughout that God will give us wisdom.
[time=3328] And Christ is the wisdom of God and it's God's heart.
[time=3332] Live down in street smarts where the vertical meets the horizontal, only in Christ.
[time=3338] The embodiment of the vertical of God in the flesh, the horizontal, where God meets man.
[time=3344] And the cross that we talked about where the vertical meets the horizontal where he gives his life for us.
[time=3349] And he now lives his life through us because he's resurrected.
[time=3352] And it's not us keeping our promises.
[time=3355] It's Christ in us that keeps our promises.
[time=3359] And we are a group of promised breakers.
[time=3362] We break promises at work.
[time=3364] We cheat in our expense accounts.
[time=3366] We cheat on our taxes.
[time=3367] We cheat on our spouses.
[time=3369] We cheat on our kids because we live outside of where the vertical meets the horizontal.
[time=3375] And that only happens in one place and it's Christ.
[time=3378] Whether you're in the classroom or in the workplace or in this church of believers or you're out anywhere.
[time=3384] Live in Christ where the vertical meets the horizontal.
[time=3388] Live, trust and obey.
[time=3392] So this week, this week, when you're filling out that expense report,
[time=3398] and you're thinking, oh man, the world tells me to pad this a little bit.
[time=3404] That's the horizontal at the expense of the vertical.
[time=3408] Come back to the sweet spot, to the crossroads of where they meet.
[time=3412] And trust the vertical promise of God and live it out horizontally in obedience and relationships and don't pad it.
[time=3419] This week, guys especially, when you're tempted with your eyes with a thought or maybe with a behavior
[time=3426] with someone who's not your wife, the world says it's okay.
[time=3431] In fact, it preaches it to me all the time.
[time=3432] It puts on every single sports thing I watch.
[time=3434] Everywhere I go, I can't even watch a news event of any kind.
[time=3437] A financial recording of any kind without having this hit me in the face.
[time=3441] And the Bible says eyes are never satisfied.
[time=3444] So even God knows I got this problem.
[time=3446] Guys, instead of stealing the look, instead of running with that idea, don't try to do the horizontal without the vertical.
[time=3454] Come back with the intersect and trust and obey and let Christ in you.
[time=3458] The Spirit free you from that because you're not going to do it on your own.
[time=3464] I'm not going to do it on my own, but Christ in me or the vertical meets the horizontal he will.
[time=3469] Students, this week in school when somebody treats you poorly and you're tempted to do a little revenge thing, come back where the vertical meets the horizontal.
[time=3479] Follow God wholeheartedly.
[time=3481] Lead courageously with only the power that the Spirit of God can give you and lead wisely.
[time=3485] Don't be foolish.
[time=3486] Don't repay evil for evil.
[time=3488] Don't do it.
[time=3489] When you're tempted this week because you need a good grade to get good exam scores, to get into a particular college and you think I'm just going to cheat and just be this one time and that end justifies the means, I need to do it.
[time=3500] Come back where the vertical meets the horizontal and fully surrender your heart and life.
[time=3508] Just trust and obey for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey.
[time=3518] I'm glad I was here to hear that.
[time=3521] I feel like I need to give him some space.
[time=3525] Wow, that was good.
[time=3527] You want to sing that song?
[time=3528] Yeah.
[time=3529] You want to do that?
[time=3530] Yeah.
[time=3531] Why don't you eat well?
[time=3533] Trust and obey.
[time=3536] Is that what you mean?
[time=3537] Exactly.
[time=3538] Let's all sing that.
[time=3539] Trust and obey for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey.
[time=3554] Happy in Jesus there.
[time=3556] That might sound kind of piffy, kind of silly.
[time=3560] Happy in Jesus.
[time=3561] Well, I want you to think about that.
[time=3564] That's life, my friends.
[time=3566] That's contentment.
[time=3568] That's protection.
[time=3569] That's obedience.
[time=3570] That's fulfillment.
[time=3572] That's satisfaction like none other.
[time=3575] Happy in Jesus.
[time=3579] That is the great truth of the gospel.
[time=3595] Thank you.
