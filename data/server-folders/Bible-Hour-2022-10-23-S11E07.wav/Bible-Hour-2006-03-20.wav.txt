[time=95] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor, here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=101] We are so thankful for the privilege that God gives us, each and every week to bring you this broadcast and to share this incredible ministry that God has given us here at Blackhawk with you in the viewing audience.
[time=114] As most of you know, we consider you as part of our family.
[time=118] We're so thankful for the relationship that God has given us with each of you.
[time=122] And I want to just mention this to you before I tell you a little bit about what you're going to see this morning.
[time=128] On our website at theblackhawkministries.org website.
[time=132] There is a link.
[time=134] There is, as you scroll down, you can see where it says, "Take Bible Hour Survey," I believe it says.
[time=140] And I just want you to know, if you've never filled out a Bible Hour survey, if you watch, if you're watching today, and this may be your first time, if you've been watching for years, but you've never gone to our website and filled out the Bible Hour survey, we would love for you to do that.
[time=156] This helps us understand the kind of ministry that we're able to have with you.
[time=162] It helps us understand you a little bit better.
[time=164] It helps us understand our audience.
[time=166] It helps us be a little bit more aware of your needs.
[time=169] And I'll tell you what it really encourages us as well, because on that survey, you'll be able to share with us maybe some of what God has done or is doing in your life and in your heart as we partner in this journey together.
[time=182] So please go to our website, click on "Take Bible Hour Survey" and let us hear from you.
[time=188] We would love to know what's going on in your life these days.
[time=191] Also, what you're going to see today is the beginning of a new series.
[time=195] And I mention this to you for a couple of reasons.
[time=197] One is that oftentimes, the beginning of a new series is an opportunity for you to begin a new relationship with us.
[time=206] I talk to many of you.
[time=208] As the weeks go by, I get notes and emails from you.
[time=211] And I hear many of you say, "One of these days, Kelly, one of these days, I'm going to show up." Or, "One of these days, we're going to come as a family." And I just want you to know, as we start this series in Joshua, it is going to be a very, very interesting, very, very challenging, I think very, very helpful series for all of us.
[time=230] And as we begin this series in the book of Joshua, I just want to invite you to come.
[time=235] I want you to go ahead and come at 9 or come at 1045, but join us as we open up the pages of God's Word.
[time=243] And as we see it, change us and grow us in the days and weeks to come.
[time=247] I'd love for you to be there with us.
[time=249] Today, we start in chapter 1, where we find out that from the very beginning of time, God has wanted one thing with you and with me and with the human race in general.
[time=260] There is one thing that God has desired to have an experience with each of us, whether it's the nation of Israel, whether it's you or me today, and that one thing is a relationship.
[time=271] And I hope that as you listen today, and I hope as God's Word speaks to you in the way that only God's Word can, I hope that you'll keep your heart and your mind open to what He wants to show you and teach you and encourage you.
[time=284] We thank you for tuning in.
[time=286] God bless you and have a great week.
[time=288] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=291] And all we'll see how great, how great it's our God.
[time=304] Name above all names.
[time=309] You are worthy of all praise.
[time=315] My heart will sing, how great it's our God.
[time=324] Name above all names.
[time=332] You are worthy of all praise.
[time=339] My heart will sing, how great it's our God.
[time=350] How great it's our God.
[time=355] Sing with me, how great it's our God.
[time=361] And all we'll see, how great, how great it's our God.
[time=371] There is no one like you.
[time=377] There has never, ever been anyone like you.
[time=383] There is no one like you.
[time=389] There has never, ever been anyone like you.
[time=396] There is no one like you.
[time=401] There has never, ever been anyone like you.
[time=421] You are more beautiful than anyone, ever, every day.
[time=427] You're the same, you never change.
[time=429] No, never, not tonight, not tonight.
[time=433] The love of my Savior, you are me.
[time=437] You're everything, you're on me forever.
[time=441] How could you be so good?
[time=445] There is no one like you.
[time=450] There has never, ever been anyone like you.
[time=455] How could you be so good to me?
[time=486] We're not alone, we're not alone, we're not alone.
[time=493] Sing along, sing along, sing along, sing along.
[time=499] Here we go, there is no one like you.
[time=504] There has never, ever been anyone like you.
[time=509] There is no one like you.
[time=514] There has never, ever been anyone like you.
[time=519] There is no one like you.
[time=524] There has never, ever been anyone like you.
[time=529] There is no one like you.
[time=533] There has never, ever been anyone like you.
[time=555] Over the next year or so, we want to, as a family when we gather, periodically be reminded, and we're going to begin this process this morning.
[time=565] We want to be reminded as a family of some very central, very, very core truths
[time=575] that mean a great deal to us as a family.
[time=580] You know, they say a value.
[time=584] They say a value is something that connects belief to action.
[time=589] And you and I, you know, we can think this or we can think that or, you know, we can have opinions about all this stuff going on over here, but when it gets right down to it, what really defines us is what we, it's what we believe, deep within us.
[time=604] And our hope here is, and our effort here, and our mindset here at Blackhawk is, it is the truth of God's Word that rests at the core of who we are.
[time=613] And we find principles there that are very, very central to the way we would live life and do ministry.
[time=620] And so over the years, we have as a leadership established some, some core, some very central values, some truths that our hope is connect belief to action.
[time=633] And there's, I think, about 10 or so of them, and we want to revisit those and the days to come, and we will revisit those core values together in settings like this.
[time=643] And we're just going to call those core value moments.
[time=646] And hopefully in these moments, you'll get a chance to be reminded of some very, very important truths.
[time=652] Here's what it will look like.
[time=654] Here's how those core value moments will begin.
[time=667] [MUSIC]
[time=693] At the very, very top of the list of truths that I would personally,
[time=699] and I believe we would, as a family, hold dearly, is this truth regarding worship.
[time=704] And here's how we say it around Blackhawk.
[time=707] We say, we say, we believe that the holiness of God, the holiness of God,
[time=715] the fact that He is so other, the fact that He is so set apart, the fact that He is so magnificent and so awesome and so majestic and so personal,
[time=727] we believe that the holiness of God compels us to worship Him privately
[time=734] and in the everyday of life as well as corporately when we gather in spirit and in truth.
[time=744] Jesus said in the conversation with the woman at the well in John 4, he said that God is looking for those.
[time=750] God is searching out, looking for those who worship Him that way.
[time=754] Not just one way, but both ways in spirit and in truth.
[time=760] Very important concepts, very important words, very important.
[time=765] Very important as they guide us, I think, toward a kind of worship and relationship with Him that would bring the most glory and the most honor to this God of ours.
[time=775] Now, sometimes we get into trouble.
[time=779] Sometimes in the church we would tend to kind of stray or move toward one end or the other.
[time=786] And I want you to be reminded this morning, we want you to be reminded this morning that sometimes in the moving to one end or the other we really lose the heart of what God was after when He said worship me in both spirit and truth.
[time=799] Maybe what happens when people begin to worship God to the exclusion of spirit and just in truth.
[time=807] You know, we're created.
[time=811] We're really a diverse group.
[time=813] God created us in such a way that we have leanings.
[time=817] We have tendencies to want to be one way or the other.
[time=821] And some of us, because of the way we're created and because of our past experiences even sometimes, it drives us to worship Him with our heads.
[time=830] And we love the truth of the Word of God.
[time=833] Sometimes for us it's dangerous because we'll leave out even His natural revelation that a lot of really creative artistic people worship Him in nature.
[time=842] And I have a tendency to just want to see it in black and white in here.
[time=845] And I might have a tendency to lift this up.
[time=849] We're to worship Him and we're supposed to love Him and love people.
[time=855] And sometimes some of us can love this book more than we love Him or love people.
[time=860] There's a danger in that because it's comfortable there.
[time=863] I can get a grid inside which I can worship Him.
[time=867] And sometimes the danger is too that I'll choose a grid, a portion of Scripture, and I'll kind of look at the rest of Scripture through that grid that I like.
[time=877] And it's dangerous.
[time=879] We need to be really careful because we'll fall in love with truth.
[time=883] We love justice instead of being willing to do it.
[time=887] We're like the Pharisees, we like to put a list together.
[time=890] And we have a tendency to get our list and make it our own list and worshiping Him in truth
[time=897] and we'll justify our list with the trues are in here.
[time=900] Be careful if you have a tendency to want to be just on the truth side of things.
[time=905] You love justice.
[time=907] He warns us about that.
[time=908] He wants us to do justice but love mercy.
[time=912] What happens sometimes is we go so far this way in our worship of God toward truth that we negate the fact that God is a God of Spirit as well.
[time=920] He's a God of emotion.
[time=922] He's a God that cried.
[time=924] He's a God that wept.
[time=925] He's a God that rejoices.
[time=926] He's a God whose anger stirred.
[time=928] He's a God of emotion as well.
[time=929] And so sometimes if we go too far that way we negate the balance there.
[time=934] But then sometimes we can go too far on the emotional side.
[time=938] And what happens there Mitch?
[time=940] Well when we worship God and Spirit at the expense of truth.
[time=944] Being high in spirit, being emotional and connecting to the mystical.
[time=949] And we do that at the expense of truth.
[time=951] I think at least two things happen.
[time=953] First one is that people who walk in the door could be confused.
[time=959] And the second one is we leave with maybe no relevance at all to apply to our lives during
[time=969] the rest of the week.
[time=971] Let me talk about the confusing one first.
[time=973] I think Paul addresses this in 1 Corinthians 14.
[time=976] He said if people come in non-believers walk in to when you assemble and you just worship
[time=982] in spirit at the expense of truth they're going to leave confused.
[time=985] They're going to leave confused.
[time=987] So what happened to me when I was I think 12 or 13 years old I experienced an assembly where they worshiped together in spirit probably at the expense of truth.
[time=997] And as a young believer I was confused.
[time=1000] I was really confused.
[time=1002] And that can happen.
[time=1003] You know Jesus said it this way to the Samaritan woman where he talks about worshiping in spirit and truth.
[time=1008] He says you Samaritans they worshiped at their own place.
[time=1011] A place where something significant happened.
[time=1013] Mount Gerasim and he says you worship what you do not know.
[time=1018] Kind of confusing.
[time=1021] So the first one is we can if we worship in spirit or an emotion in the expense of truth we can
[time=1027] be confused.
[time=1028] People who walk in the door especially will be confused.
[time=1030] And the second thing is that we leave with no relevance to apply to the rest of our lives.
[time=1037] We experience this emotional high but then we go out the doors and so what now what now what now what I do.
[time=1043] And we kind of end up living for this dependency for some emotional experience and put God in
[time=1049] this box but can't really apply anything any of his wisdom to the rest of our lives.
[time=1053] So when we worship God in spirit or an emotion or in this mystical realm at the expense of
[time=1060] truth we will leave others confused and we will leave wanting for relevance for our lives.
[time=1071] So our commitment our commitment to you all and our commitment to God is that we are going to try our best with His help to be a people who worship God in spirit who worship God with
[time=1084] hearts that are stirred.
[time=1086] We will we will raise our hands in respect and reverence.
[time=1091] We will clap and we will shout and we will dance and we will sing.
[time=1096] And we will with hearts stirred on the spirit side always be guided by and live in submission
[time=1103] to and worship in subjection to the truth.
[time=1107] The very songs that we sing you know you may think that just gets thrown together.
[time=1111] It's not the songs that we sing the messages that are taught all of that is with a great commitment to try and bring to this family truth.
[time=1119] And yet we will do that with hearts that are engaged with a God who is so committed to both.
[time=1126] The holiness of God compels us to worship Him in spirit and truth and let's continue to
[time=1132] do that very thing this morning.
[time=1134] All the saints adore thee casting down their golden crowns around the glass we see.
[time=1154] Share a pen and sail of Him falling down before you.
[time=1167] It's word and thought and evermore shall be.
[time=1189] It's the anthem of the Lord's free now and it's rising up.
[time=1203] All around it's the anthem of the Lord's free now.
[time=1212] Well it's rising up all around it's the anthem of the Lord's free now and it's rising up all around it's the anthem of the Lord's free now.
[time=1239] Together we sing.
[time=1245] Everyone sing.
[time=1251] For the earth is filled with His glory.
[time=1281] We stand and lift up my hands.
[time=1295] We bow down and worship Him now.
[time=1303] How awesome is He! Together we sing.
[time=1312] Everyone sing.
[time=1318] For the earth is filled with His glory.
[time=1390] Before we sing this final song would you do me a favor if you have the word of God with you this morning would you just pick it up and hold it in your hand as we sing about ancient words that are ever true.
[time=1404] The words that were preserved for us to know and understand, to love for them to permeate our minds and our hearts.
[time=1433] O the words non-preserved for our walk in this world, they breeze down with God's own heart.
[time=1447] O let the ancient words in heart.
[time=1455] Words of life, words of hope, give them strength, help us grow in this world where every road, ancient words will guide us home.
[time=1477] Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=1487] We have come with open hearts.
[time=1491] O let the ancient words in heart.
[time=1507] O the words of our faith handed down to the stage came to us through sacrifice.
[time=1521] O me the faithful words of Christ!
[time=1535] For the words non-preserved for our walk in this world, they breeze down with God's own heart.
[time=1543] O let the ancient words in heart.
[time=1550] Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=1559] We have come with open hearts.
[time=1564] O let the ancient words in heart.
[time=1569] Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=1578] We have come with open hearts.
[time=1583] O let the ancient words in heart.
[time=1588] Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=1597] We have come with open hearts.
[time=1602] O let the ancient words in heart.
[time=1608] We have come with open hearts.
[time=1614] O let the ancient words in heart.
[time=1621] Do you pray with me?
[time=1626] Father in heaven, what we hold in our hands, we view as a precious gift.
[time=1636] Father, for us to think that what we hold in our hands is void of the Spirit would be foolish.
[time=1642] What we hold in our hands is already a perfect balance of the truth that comes from your Spirit.
[time=1652] Father, I pray that you would help us to know your Word, for it to permeate our minds and our hearts.
[time=1661] Father, that your Spirit would be full in us.
[time=1667] That every word in there is God breathed and is useful for correcting and rebuking and teaching
[time=1675] and training and righteousness.
[time=1677] God, train us to be righteous.
[time=1683] Father, I pray that we would know you and that we would know you through your Word and through your Spirit.
[time=1691] And that you would change our lives because of it.
[time=1693] God, give us ears to hear and eyes to see what you have for us the rest of this day.
[time=1698] God, I pray for Kelly as he comes to lead us in the worship through the Word.
[time=1703] God, that we would be receptive to what you have to teach us.
[time=1707] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1710] Well, open your Bibles, if you would, to Joshua.
[time=1713] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, then comes Joshua.
[time=1718] Turn to Joshua chapter 1.
[time=1721] I want to thank Stephen and Mitch last week for helping as we began to kind of unpack and unfold just a bit.
[time=1728] This amazing story of the Old and New Testament, the Word of God, this fluid text,
[time=1735] this one amazing story of God's redemptive plan for all of history
[time=1741] and for the people that he has pursued through the years.
[time=1744] We noted at the beginning of the story that there is a very special relationship between God
[time=1750] and a people called Israel.
[time=1752] And as we see God's unique relationship with the people of Israel, continue to unfold
[time=1758] in the first five books of the Old Testament.
[time=1761] And as we come now to the beginning of the book of Joshua here in chapter 1, we see that God and the Israelites have come to a very significant place.
[time=1771] And I don't want you to miss that.
[time=1773] We come to Joshua 1 here and we see in this relationship that God and the nation of Israel have come to a very, very important juncture.
[time=1782] Something really significant is about to happen.
[time=1786] And we get the privilege of looking in on this as we come to Joshua chapter 1.
[time=1791] It has already been a very long and challenging journey for these people, literally, physically and spiritually in their relationship with their God.
[time=1801] Now things are about to change.
[time=1803] Joshua chapter 1, verses 1 and 2, look with me and let's see where this story is now headed.
[time=1810] In honor of God's word, would you stand and let me read this for you.
[time=1814] Joshua chapter 1, verses 1 and 2.
[time=1817] It says there, "Now it came about after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of none.
[time=1826] Moses' servant, saying, "Moses my servant is dead.
[time=1831] Now therefore arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people,
[time=1837] to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel."
[time=1845] Pray with me.
[time=1846] Would you, Father God, we stand before you this morning and as we come to this study of Joshua,
[time=1852] as we open up again, God, the pages of these ancient words, I'm reminded of the song that we just sang.
[time=1859] I'm reminded of that line that talked about hearts that are open and God, your willingness to impart this great truth to open hearts.
[time=1871] God, I don't know, I have no idea of where every heart in this room is this morning.
[time=1879] I have no idea of all the circumstances and situations surrounding each and every heart in this room.
[time=1887] God, there may be some in crisis, there may be some on the run, there may be some in real turmoil.
[time=1893] God, there may be some full of joy and great peace.
[time=1897] Father, God, I pray this morning that you would, God, that your spirit would open hearts.
[time=1903] God, that we would cooperate in that effort and that we would submit to the power of your spirit and the power of your word, a word that can search and speak deep into the very heart of every person here.
[time=1916] God, we pray that you would do that.
[time=1919] We pray that you would calm our fears, that you would ease our tensions, God, that you would draw us ever closer to you and to what is right and true and good.
[time=1929] And we'll thank you for it with open hearts and all God's people said, amen, you can be seated.
[time=1936] All right, so there you have it right there.
[time=1941] God says to Joshua, Joshua, you and all the people.
[time=1947] He says, in essence, it's time.
[time=1951] It's time, Joshua.
[time=1953] It's time to lead the people.
[time=1955] Joshua, he says, it's time there in those first two verses.
[time=1958] It's time to cross the Jordan.
[time=1961] It's time to inherit the land.
[time=1963] It's time to finally possess this land that I have promised.
[time=1969] And this has been a long time coming.
[time=1972] It looks as if the children, it looks like the children of Israel will finally move into this promised land that I want you just for a moment to just imagine all the pent up expectation,
[time=1983] all the pent up excitement they must have been experiencing.
[time=1987] They had been on the move now through an entire generation.
[time=1990] The scriptures teach us that for over 40 years now they've been wandering in the desert and now they're literally on the edge.
[time=1997] I mean, they're literally on the shore.
[time=2000] The nation of Israel has come to the water line of the Jordan and across the Jordan rests this land that they have been promised.
[time=2010] Now let me just ask you here.
[time=2012] I think it's important for us to take note of this.
[time=2014] What did the promised land mean to the Israelites?
[time=2017] Why was this so important?
[time=2019] Well, the history of the Jewish people begins with Abraham.
[time=2024] Some of you may know that, others of you may not, you might want to write that down.
[time=2027] It begins with a man named Abraham.
[time=2030] And the story of Abraham begins when God tells him to leave his homeland promising Abraham and all of his descendants a new home in the land of Canaan.
[time=2041] This is the land now known as Israel, named after Abraham's grandson, whose descendants are the Jewish people.
[time=2047] The land is often referred to as the promised land because of God's repeated promises to give the land to the descendants of Abraham.
[time=2056] And we see this first promise.
[time=2058] Open your Bibles back to Genesis, the very first book of the Bible, Genesis chapter 12.
[time=2064] Here we see the initiation of this promise.
[time=2067] And you'll note as we read that Abraham is called Abram.
[time=2071] This was his name, originally God changes it later to Abraham, it says there in Genesis 12 verses 1-7.
[time=2078] Now the Lord said to Abram, go forth from your country and from your relatives and from your father's house.
[time=2087] Don't miss that.
[time=2088] From your country, from your relatives and from your father's house to the land which I will show you.
[time=2095] And I will make you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great and so you shall be a blessing.
[time=2101] And I will bless those who bless you and the ones who, and the one who curses you I will curse.
[time=2107] And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed verse 4, so Abram went forth.
[time=2114] As the Lord had spoken to him and lot went with him, now Abram was, go ahead and say that out loud.
[time=2121] You think you had a few patterns developed?
[time=2125] Let's just think about that for a moment.
[time=2128] Do you think there were a few things that he was used to doing?
[time=2134] Do you think there was a routine in his life that he was used to functioning with?
[time=2138] Think about this just for a moment and just be reminded of this my friends because sometimes God calls you and I to do.
[time=2144] Sometimes God calls you and I to move.
[time=2146] Sometimes he asks us to adjust.
[time=2150] And I just want you to note that after 75 years verse 4, so Abram went forth.
[time=2160] There does not appear to be a great deal of wrestling.
[time=2166] There doesn't appear to be a great deal of, hey, but that's not fair because I've been here for 75 years.
[time=2172] So Abram went forth, Abram, verse 5, took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his nephew,
[time=2178] and all their possessions which they had accumulated and the persons which they had acquired in Haran
[time=2184] and they set out for the land of Canaan.
[time=2187] Thus they came to the land of Canaan.
[time=2189] Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem to the oak of Morah.
[time=2195] Now the Canaanite was then in the land and the Lord appeared to Abram and said,
[time=2201] "To your descendants I will give this what?" Say it.
[time=2206] So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him.
[time=2211] Just turn a page over to Genesis 13.
[time=2214] The promise is repeated.
[time=2215] Genesis 13, pick it up in verse 14.
[time=2218] It says, "The Lord said to Abram after Lot had separated from him now." What a sight this must have been.
[time=2225] Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward
[time=2233] and westward for all the land which you see.
[time=2237] I will give it to you and to your descendants forever.
[time=2242] And now I want you to take special notice of Genesis 17.8.
[time=2246] The verbiage here in Genesis 17.8 is verbiage that you would see again and again and again
[time=2252] in God's dealings with, in God's word, in God's speaking to his people.
[time=2257] 17.8, I want you to catch this.
[time=2260] He says in verse 8, "I will give to you and to your descendants after you the what?" Say it.
[time=2267] The land of your sojournings.
[time=2269] All the what?
[time=2271] All the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession.
[time=2275] And here you go.
[time=2277] And I, I will give you land, but I will be their God.
[time=2290] Just look at that for a moment.
[time=2292] And I, it says, will be their God.
[time=2297] I would ask you this morning to consider this my friends.
[time=2300] What did God have in mind with the whole promised land thing?
[time=2306] I mean, really, what is the promised land really about?
[time=2312] Do you think his promise?
[time=2316] Do you think for a moment that is covenant with these people was really just about land?
[time=2325] I mean, I know it was about land, but what was it really about?
[time=2331] Was, was it rocks?
[time=2334] An acreage?
[time=2336] And mountains and streams that he desired most for his people?
[time=2343] What does God desire?
[time=2345] What has God always desired most for his people?
[time=2350] I mean, stop and think about it for a moment.
[time=2353] From the beginning of human history, which is really just a few pages back, right?
[time=2360] From the beginning of human history, he has really been about one thing.
[time=2367] And I'll give you a hint.
[time=2369] It wasn't rocks.
[time=2372] It wasn't dirt.
[time=2374] It wasn't land.
[time=2377] Now, it's true that at the onset of human history, God gave to Adam and Eve a nice little parcel of land called Eden.
[time=2387] It's true.
[time=2389] He gave at the very beginning of all of this to Adam and Eve a place called Eden.
[time=2393] He gave them land.
[time=2395] But what I want you to think about and give some thought to this morning is what had the three of them experienced in Eden?
[time=2404] Yes, he gave them Eden.
[time=2407] What did he experience with the three of them in Eden?
[time=2410] And I got to tell you this week as I looked at this, I have seen this before, I have heard this taught before.
[time=2416] This was not a new truth, but it jumped off the page like a new truth does.
[time=2421] And I want you to turn to Genesis chapter three, if you would.
[time=2425] Genesis three, verse eight, we find ourselves here in the midst of the story here of the fall of man.
[time=2431] This is where sin enters the picture dividing and separating the relationship between God and man.
[time=2438] But tucked away here in verse eight, you find this incredible insight.
[time=2442] And I just couldn't wait to show it to you today.
[time=2445] What had God and Adam and Eve experienced in the garden, my friends, in the land that he had given them?
[time=2453] Well, look at this, it says in verse eight, they heard the sound, they're hiding, right?
[time=2457] Verse seven says, "Then the eyes of both, they ate the fruit, and the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked because of sin, and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings."
[time=2469] That's verse seven, now verse eight.
[time=2471] They heard, then they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day.
[time=2481] And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
[time=2488] What is so interesting, my friends, and what is so powerful is you might pick it up in a cursory reading here of the English text
[time=2496] when you look at it in the language, when you go to the Hebrew, you realize that the translation of that is this,
[time=2502] that they heard the sound of the Lord God walking.
[time=2505] How did they know it was the sound of the Lord God walking?
[time=2510] They knew it was the sound of the Lord God walking in the cool of the day in the garden there because they had heard it time and time again.
[time=2523] God, God had walked with them in the garden, in the cool of the day, and in walking with God in the garden, they recognized this sound.
[time=2537] And then look at this, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the what?
[time=2542] From what they had known and experienced and basked in at one point, they hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God.
[time=2558] You know what I think they had? I think they had relationship. I think they had intimacy.
[time=2568] I think what God had in mind and what God had been about and has been about and continues to be about.
[time=2574] He's been about it from day one, and that is people basking in the presence of the Lord, people walking in the garden in the cool of the day.
[time=2586] Genesis 17-8, I'm going to give them the land, but I will be there, what? They're God.
[time=2595] Well, I'll just go back to Joshua 1. Watch how this, I mean the whole relationship and land thing just continues to develop.
[time=2604] If you go to Joshua 1, verse 4 and verse 5, you see it right here, look at verse 4, he kind of comes back to the land idea from the wilderness and this Lebanon,
[time=2613] even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the great seed toward the setting of the sun will be your land, your territory.
[time=2624] No man, verse 5, here you go, no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life just as I have been with Moses.
[time=2633] I, Joshua, I will be with you. I will not fail you or forsake you, because we are going to be together.
[time=2646] This is about a relationship of intimacy.
[time=2652] You see it, I'm sorry, just go back one more time. Go back to Numbers 33, you see it here as well.
[time=2658] You see it all through the beginning of this great story, my friends. Go to Numbers 33.
[time=2665] Numbers 33 verses 50 to 52 under the heading in my Bible where it says the law of possessing the land.
[time=2674] It says in verse 50, "Then the Lord spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the what?
[time=2681] By the Jordan opposite Jericho." I mean, they're at this spot. This is a few years before, but they're right back at the same spot.
[time=2689] And at that spot, he says to Moses, he says, "Speak to the sons of Israel."
[time=2696] This is what was on God's heart as he began to articulate the possessing of the land.
[time=2701] When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you
[time=2710] and destroy all their figured stones.
[time=2714] Now, we begin to realize that there is the potential for idolatry.
[time=2718] With these figured stones, God knew that there would be competition for the intimacy.
[time=2726] There would be temptation to replace him in relationship.
[time=2732] God understands this, and God is a zealous and jealous God longing to be from the very beginning.
[time=2738] In relationship him and him alone, and I will be their God.
[time=2746] Destroy all their figured stones and destroy all their molten images and demolish all their high places.
[time=2756] So let me ask you again, what has God always had in mind?
[time=2765] What is it that God has always longed for?
[time=2771] What does he have in mind, and what is he longed for with you today, right here, right now?
[time=2781] What is he longing to have with you? Let me ask it this way.
[time=2784] What is your promised land?
[time=2788] Now, I know that there isn't anybody in the room who...
[time=2796] God hasn't come to anybody in the night and promised you two acres on the other side of the mommy.
[time=2802] I don't think.
[time=2804] Anybody?
[time=2805] All right.
[time=2807] I'm not asking you about land.
[time=2811] I think even in just a few minutes here, I think it's pretty clear.
[time=2818] I think the Scriptures have been very, very clear that the promise is about much, much more than land.
[time=2825] And I want you to see this morning, right from Joshua 1, what I believe as I've studied this and as we've looked at this,
[time=2831] I believe you see right here in the pages of chapter 1 what the land, what the promised land is really about.
[time=2838] And it is so, so encouraging. My friends, look at Joshua chapter 1 verse 13.
[time=2846] Kind of tucked away here. You don't want to miss this, though. Joshua 1, 13. Here you go.
[time=2850] What's the land about? Remember the word, and here it is.
[time=2853] Remember the word which Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you, saying, "The Lord your God gives you..."
[time=2860] Why? Say it. Look at that. Look at what the Lord your God gives you.
[time=2874] Look at what the promise, here's the descriptor used in the text.
[time=2878] This is how the land is described first and foremost, and the Lord your God gives you rest and will give you,
[time=2889] secondarily now comes the land. He will give you rest and He will give you this land.
[time=2897] This land, this promise was to bring rest, my friends, and I want you to think about this.
[time=2902] If ever there was a people who were in need of rest, it was who? The Israelites.
[time=2910] And I want you to think about it today. If ever there was a group of people who were in need of rest, it would be you and me.
[time=2922] Rest. The Israelites, they'd been in slavery for hundreds of years in Egypt.
[time=2928] They had wandered in the desert with complaining confused hearts for over 40 years, and now God wants to give them rest.
[time=2937] And what an amazing word this is, if you go back to 113, where it says there that the Lord your God gives you rest,
[time=2945] the Hebrew word used here for rest is the word nuach. You can write that down, N-O-O-A-K-H, nuach, which means to cause or give comfort or rest.
[time=2957] It also meant to create an atmosphere of peace, to cause or create an atmosphere of peace, to give rest, peace and rest.
[time=2971] Sound familiar? You and me and the rest of the human race, my friends, have been chasing after those two things from the day we were born.
[time=2984] Peace and rest. We pursue rest. Think about it. And I mean that. Think about it.
[time=2994] We pursue rest and peace. We pursue it in cash. We pursue it in material accumulations.
[time=3004] We pursue it in stimulation and pleasure. We pursue it in ministry success. We pursue it with bigger homes and nicer cars and a different spouse.
[time=3016] We go chasing after peace and rest. Peace and rest. We've been wanting peace and rest from the very beginning.
[time=3024] We go to the wrong website because we think somehow that will quiet the storm. We have two more drinks, one more purchase.
[time=3034] But where's the peace? Where's the rest? Listen, this is the way it has been from the very beginning.
[time=3047] And we just kind of spelled it out there for you. Just listen, he had a land that is true. He had a land for them in which he longed to experience relationship with them through which he desired to give them rest.
[time=3066] Through which he desired to grant them peace. He had a land for them in which he longed to experience relationship with them through which he desired to give them rest.
[time=3080] And you say okay wow that boy that sounds good but that was then and that was them. But don't forget what we said last week. See my friends this is one text.
[time=3093] This is one unbelievably fluid and connected story of God's redeeming pursuit of a people. He has always wanted a people. He has always desired relationship and intimacy over and above all else.
[time=3108] And yes this was then and yes this was them and yes it's here in Joshua chapter one back here on this end of the book but if you turn to this end of the book and you turn to Matthew chapter 11 and you look at verse 28 and 29.
[time=3126] It says hundreds and hundreds of years later come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you what? Say it louder. Rest.
[time=3140] And how do you participate in how do you embrace that rest like a 29. Take my yoke upon you and learn my teachings. The truth that I'm offering take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls in him.
[time=3165] In his yoke in his teaching in his truth not in two more drinks not in the wrong website not in one more purchase not in more square feet not in a bigger job with a better business card.
[time=3182] He may give you those things not the wrong website or the two more drinks but he may give you those things to use to bring great glory to him but you my friends we do not find peace.
[time=3201] The peace that transcends all understanding isn't found there it is found in Jesus Christ it has always been that way. It will always be that way and I want to make sure this morning that you don't miss this.
[time=3218] Sometimes when we talk about finding rest sometimes when we talk about finding peace sometimes when we talk about coming to this realization and living and basking in the presence of God coming to relationship with him.
[time=3230] We oftentimes talk about or point that conversation towards those who are far from God who haven't yet experienced that with him and that's okay that's good but don't forget that those of us that know him and those of us that have fully surrendered our hearts and lives to him.
[time=3245] We keep going to the websites to we keep we keep thinking that somehow some way there's going to be more real satisfying or gratifying peace in the same places that they're going.
[time=3258] So whether far from God on a journey towards faith or already in the family the truth of the gospel remains so powerful today that what he has been about and what he has promised and what he is ready to give
[time=3272] is peace and rest found in intimacy with him period and we're out of time but don't forget who was the man who was the man that God chose to lead these people to that rest his name was Joshua.
[time=3292] Joshua, listen, listen, Joshua chosen to lead the people to the land of rest and peace. You know what?
[time=3301] There are teachers in this room. There are mothers and fathers in this room. There are principals in this room.
[time=3308] There are business executives in this room. There are people who work in cubicles in businesses in this room.
[time=3314] There are friends in this room people. Every one of us that knows him have been given the opportunity and privilege to lead people toward the rest, to lead people, to point people toward to help them get across the river.
[time=3332] I don't care who you are, how old you are. It is going to require of you. In our effort to point people toward rest it will require of you with your kids for instance.
[time=3346] It will require of you and I with our kids the same things that were called out of Joshua. Look, look, verse 6, Joshua, okay, there's the land, there's the rest in peace.
[time=3359] Be strong and courageous for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them only be strong and as a matter of fact be very courageous.
[time=3374] Remember what's in the land? What did the spies come back and say we're in the land? They said there were giants in the land. Big, mean, nasty giants who weren't going to want these people taking possession.
[time=3388] That's what as you and I lead kids toward the rest as you and I lead in ministry with people of all ages towards the rest. There's an enemy and you and I must be strong and as a matter of fact very courageous.
[time=3403] Look at this book, look at it. Be careful to do according to all, verse 7. Be careful to do in that process of leading. Be careful to do according to all the law which Moses, my servant, commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left so that you may have success wherever you go.
[time=3422] The law shall not depart from your mouth. You want to lead people well to the promise? You shall meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it for then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have success.
[time=3437] Then they will find rest. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do you think it was important for him to be strong and courageous?
[time=3448] Do not tremble or be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. Would you stand with me this morning?
[time=3460] And quietly let me just end our time with this. Father God we stand as people who would be prone to trembling. God we would be prone to being dismayed.
[time=3470] God we would in our sinfulness be prone to a lack of strength and an absence of courage but as we learned last week in you we are made strong.
[time=3480] In you we have vision. We're given perspective and God we thank you for the privilege of trying to help lead and point your people toward the rest, toward the peace, toward the land God that you have given them.
[time=3493] And we pray God that you would do that in us, that we would have eyes and lives that are open to what you would have for us and God that we would with great courage, the courage that you provide.
[time=3504] Do everything within our power with your help God to point and guide and encourage and come alongside those making that journey.
[time=3514] Thank you for your great truth this morning.
[time=3517] May we be changed because of these ancient words and all God's people said amen.
[time=3547] [MUSIC]
[time=3577] [APPLAUSE - 30 seconds]
