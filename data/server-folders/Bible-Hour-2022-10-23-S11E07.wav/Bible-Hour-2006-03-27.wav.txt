[time=138] - Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=142] It's our privilege to share church with you today, and we really hope that you'll glean from the Scriptures what it is that God has for you today,
[time=151] and enjoy the worship time as we get to sing together and pray together.
[time=157] There are a couple announcements that I'd like to pass on to you.
[time=161] Good Friday morning.
[time=163] At 7.30 in the morning, the YMCA and Race to Win Ministries
[time=169] are co-hosting a prayer breakfast.
[time=172] The chaplain from the Annapolis Colts is going to be the speaker, and it's going to be at the Grand Wayne Center at 7.30 in the morning.
[time=182] You can contact the YMCA to get tickets in order to join us for that breakfast.
[time=189] That's a good Friday, April 14th, 7.30 in the morning at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=195] And then the next morning, at 8 o'clock in the morning, some men are going to gather together at one summit square on the 13th floor.
[time=204] We're going to have to come in the Washington Street entrance at one summit square, and we'll go up to the 13th floor at the window garden restaurant.
[time=212] We're going to pray for the city of Fort Wayne, just for a half hour.
[time=215] We're not going to have coffee, we're not going to have donuts, we're not going to have music, we're going to pray and just beg God to reveal to us what the needs in the Northeast Indiana and Fort Wayne really are,
[time=228] and how we as churches can reach people and meet those needs.
[time=233] So join us if you want to 8 o'clock Saturday morning, April 15th, at one summit square to pray together as men.
[time=242] And then I'd also like to invite you to attend church here if you don't have a church.
[time=246] On Easter Sunday, we're going to have a great service together.
[time=250] So I'd encourage you to join us here at Blackhawk for Easter Sunday.
[time=256] Well this morning, the message is from Joshua chapter 2.
[time=261] And this book is filled with stories like this one, but this one's unique.
[time=266] Rahab the harlot, and she shelters two spies that Joshua sends out
[time=273] to scope out the land and scope out Jericho.
[time=276] And in that message, we get a chance, in that passage rather, we get a chance to discover the God of forever.
[time=285] The God of heaven and the God of earth that Rahab talks about.
[time=291] And we'll get a chance to think about how we might be willing to take risks to build the kingdom of Jesus Christ.
[time=298] So please stay with us and join us for that sermon.
[time=301] And I pray that God will use this passage of scripture in Joshua chapter 2
[time=307] to help you become the person of God that he wants you to be.
[time=315] Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation.
[time=326] O my soul praise him for he is my hope and salvation.
[time=336] O ye who hear, now to his temple, John thee.
[time=345] Praise him in glad adoration.
[time=362] Praise to the Lord, who are all things so wondrously ready there.
[time=372] Shelters the under his wings he so gently sustainer.
[time=383] As thou not seen, how thy desire have been.
[time=392] Grinching what he all gave.
[time=399] Hallelujah.
[time=423] Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend me.
[time=434] Surely his goodness and mercy here daily attend me.
[time=444] Honder I do, but the Almighty can do.
[time=453] And if with its love he may bend me.
[time=459] Praise to the Lord.
[time=461] Praise to the Lord, O Lamb.
[time=464] All that is in me adore him.
[time=471] All that has life and bread come down, it praises me for him.
[time=482] Let thee amen.
[time=485] Sound from his people again.
[time=491] Let thee for him we adore him.
[time=497] Let thee amen.
[time=502] Sound from his people again.
[time=508] Let thee for him we adore him.
[time=515] Hallelujah.
[time=685] And I will worship you Lord, only you Lord.
[time=696] And I will bow down for you, only you Lord.
[time=706] And I will worship you Lord, only you Lord.
[time=717] And I will bow down for you, only you Lord.
[time=757] And I will worship you Lord, only you Lord.
[time=785] And I will bow down for you, only you Lord.
[time=814] And the Lord said to Joshua, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
[time=820] I will never, never leave you nor forsake you.
[time=826] Be strong, courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land.
[time=832] I swore to their fathers to give them.
[time=835] Be strong and very courageous.
[time=839] Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you.
[time=844] Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.
[time=854] Do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth.
[time=858] Meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.
[time=866] Then you will be prosperous and successful.
[time=871] Have I not commanded you?
[time=873] Be strong and courageous.
[time=876] Do not be terrified, do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
[time=892] Be strong and take courage, do not fear or be dismayed.
[time=916] But the Lord will go before you, and His light will show the way.
[time=931] Be strong and take courage, do not fear or be dismayed.
[time=945] For the Lord who lives within you will be strong in you today.
[time=959] Why don't you give in all of your peace?
[time=974] Be strong and take courage, do not fear or be dismayed.
[time=1003] For the Lord will go before you, and His light will show the way.
[time=1018] Be strong and take courage, do not fear or be dismayed.
[time=1032] For the one who lives within you will be strong in you today.
[time=1046] Nothing can take you out of his hands, nothing can face you that you can command.
[time=1061] I know that you will always be in his love, in his power he will be free.
[time=1078] Be strong and take courage, do not fear or be dismayed.
[time=1090] For the Lord will go before you, and His light will show the way.
[time=1108] Be strong and take courage, do not fear or be dismayed.
[time=1123] For the one who lives within you will be strong in you today.
[time=1137] Be strong and take courage for the one who lives within you will be strong in you today.
[time=1166] Be strong and take courage for the one who lives within you.
[time=1195] The same one, the same one who was strong and in Joshua,
[time=1210] the same one that Joshua was to yield to and be strong and courageous is the very one that's in us.
[time=1219] That time means nothing and we have the incredible privilege of being strong and courageous for him today.
[time=1236] I've never seen so many people look left in my life.
[time=1243] What a privilege we have to study the Word. We're going to look in the Bible and we're going to read an event today.
[time=1255] It's a lengthy event, it's a whole chapter. We're going to spend the time looking at the facts of Joshua chapter 2
[time=1263] and learn how we too can be strong and courageous and apply that in our lives.
[time=1270] We had a great weekend this weekend at our house.
[time=1274] This is the first time that we have had Earl and Abigail and Parker.
[time=1282] Our little Parker Noel was born December 10th and she's the only baby in the last few months.
[time=1292] It's a lot prettier and neater than Maya Miller.
[time=1296] I'm really thankful for that. We had Earl and Abigail and Parker and we had our son Brian and Jen and Haley,
[time=1305] our other granddaughter, and Josh and Steph were all at our house this weekend.
[time=1309] I always wanted a big family and God in his way is starting to give me one.
[time=1316] Maybe it's going to be in grandchildren. I'd like for you guys to have one next year and another one the next year.
[time=1322] And it's just been great. Last night Josh got to teach for the first time in church at Heartland.
[time=1331] Andy Booth invited him to come and teach their soul trip.
[time=1335] And that was a treat for Earl and I to sit there and listen to him teach from the Psalms.
[time=1342] I'm kind of bursting today so you may get a whole load. Just get ready for that.
[time=1349] Well, in World War II there were people that had responsibilities to be scouts.
[time=1359] You know there have always been scouts. People in military events you've always needed information.
[time=1365] Reconnaissance troops have always gone out behind enemy lines and discovered what was true about the enemy.
[time=1375] And then come back and report what they find out.
[time=1380] In the Philippines, right after the baton death march, we say baton usually,
[time=1387] but I was corrected after the first service, it's baton death march.
[time=1392] There were some of our POWs that were captive after surviving that death march.
[time=1400] And they were put in a camp.
[time=1405] And there was a general whose job it was, General Kruger, his responsibility was to develop a plan to rescue those captive service men who'd survived that death march.
[time=1423] And they were in a place called Cabana Tuane, and General Kruger sent for the Alamo scouts, they were part of his division.
[time=1435] The Alamo scouts were named Alamo because he was from San Antonio so he gave him that name, the Alamo scouts.
[time=1443] Two teams of scouts were chosen to work the mission.
[time=1448] The Nellist and Roundsville teams named after their leaders undertook reconnaissance there at Cabana Tuane.
[time=1456] They gathered useful information on Japanese movements in the camp's vicinity.
[time=1464] Nevertheless, they were stymied.
[time=1467] They needed better information on the movements within the camp and they couldn't get near the camp.
[time=1473] The surrounding fields were too flat, they'd be discovered.
[time=1480] They were sure that they would be seen.
[time=1484] So they were losing time and they were worried and the scouts were getting frustrated.
[time=1494] They needed more information, they knew they couldn't have a safe rescue if they didn't know more about what was going on inside that camp.
[time=1504] Lieutenant Bill Nellist, one of those leaders, hatched out a plan.
[time=1510] He reasoned that although it was impossible to get close enough to the camp, there was some high ground nearby with a hut.
[time=1518] He had spotted this shack and thought it might just provide the vantage point necessary to get the information that they needed.
[time=1529] It was risky, but he decided that he and Rufo, and this is a hard word to pronounce, Vacular, a Filipino-American Alamo scout,
[time=1543] would dress up as Filipino villagers and attempt to gain access to that hut.
[time=1549] Folks, when you put on other clothing than your uniform and you get caught, you die, and they knew that.
[time=1561] But they dressed up in these farmer villager outfits, and they took off for this hut, and the plan worked.
[time=1573] Nellist and Vacular, Don Straw hats and farmer costumes, and they salad for the shack.
[time=1579] Nellist couldn't have been more pleased. The view was extraordinary. They could see right into the compound.
[time=1585] For two hours, they made notes detailing the major features of the camp and the best routes for the Rangers.
[time=1593] Then they heard a strange noise.
[time=1597] Three more Alamo scouts had come to join them.
[time=1604] They crawled on their bellies through those fields all the way to their two scouts to protect their back.
[time=1622] Nellist gave the report and sent those guys back to the commander.
[time=1627] The Rangers came in there, and with very few losses, they were able to rescue 512 of our servicemen who had survived that death march.
[time=1640] Because a couple guys were willing to risk their lives to get the information necessary to save a bunch of lives.
[time=1655] Look at Joshua chapter 2 with me, please.
[time=1661] In Joshua chapter 2, we encounter two spies.
[time=1670] Then we encounter a prostitute that says, "Then Joshua, son of none." Chapter 2 verse 1.
[time=1679] Sent two spies, secretly sent two spies from Chateem.
[time=1684] "Go look over the land," he said, "especially Jericho." So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
[time=1695] For a long time, people have been trying to figure out some answers to questions that come up because you read this passage and you see that God uses a prostitute.
[time=1708] And he sends only two spies. Why two spies?
[time=1714] Now, the answer to many questions in the Bible are you can read answers to many questions that really are speculation.
[time=1723] And I'd just like to encourage you to find the people who admit that they're speculating about answers to questions that you might have.
[time=1732] I'm just going to say pure speculation here, what we don't know. Why two spies?
[time=1738] Perhaps symbolic of the fact that two spies had originally trusted God out of the twelve that he'd sent.
[time=1747] Now, let's go back in time for a minute and get a little history lesson here to remember what's going on and understand what's going on now.
[time=1756] Well, in Egypt, Joseph and his brothers, sons of Jacob, whose name became Israel, remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?
[time=1769] Jacob's sons sold Joseph into captivity in Egypt, and then they end up needing him because drought and famine caused the whole Israeli nation to be starving.
[time=1784] And so, the children of Israel came to Egypt, and Joseph provided them with food that they needed.
[time=1792] And then remember they were there for years and were prolific in reproducing, and Pharaoh was really worried about them,
[time=1798] and so he, remember he made them make bricks without straw and was really abusive, and finally God raises up Moses,
[time=1804] and Moses leads those children of Israel out of Egypt across the Red Sea and toward the Promised Land.
[time=1813] Here at the Jordan River, but the people had not trusted God. Remember, Moses had sent twelve spies out.
[time=1824] Joshua and Caleb were two of the twelve, one from each tribe, and when the twelve spies came back after scouting out the Promised Land,
[time=1834] ten of them said, "We can't do this. They're big. They're really big. They were big."
[time=1844] But Joshua and Caleb said, "God can do this."
[time=1850] God had said he was going to take the Promised Land.
[time=1856] So there were two spies that said yes, and ten that said no, and God said, "You ten and all the people that are over twenty years old
[time=1869] are going to die before you get to go to the Promised Land, and for forty years they wondered in the desert."
[time=1878] He said, except for Joshua and Caleb, they're going to get to go in, and everybody twenty years and under.
[time=1887] So they wondered in the desert for forty years, and finally Moses dies, and God says to Joshua, "Be strong and courageous.
[time=1896] You heard what Marsha read what the choir sang about." He said, "Joshua, you be strong and courageous, and you lead my people across the Jordan River, and you take the Promised Land,
[time=1908] because I'm going to take the Promised Land through you." Joshua didn't have to be strong and courageous, relying on Joshua, or strong and courageous, relying on the soldiers that followed him.
[time=1925] Joshua was to meditate on the Word of God, and with a renewed mind, the obedient to the living God who was going to take the Promised Land.
[time=1937] Be strong and courageous as a man, thinking about me, God said, and the fact that I'm able to do it.
[time=1946] What we don't know, we don't know why two spies. Perhaps there were two because Joshua and Caleb were the only two that said, "Yes, God can do it."
[time=1957] So then Joshua says, "Well, I'll just send two. I won't send twelve, and then I'll get the two right responses."
[time=1964] Perhaps there was safety in a small number. We don't know. The Bible does not reveal why.
[time=1970] The Word doesn't tell us why.
[time=1975] Why the house of a prostitute?
[time=1979] Rahab.
[time=1983] Pure speculation again here.
[time=1987] Perhaps it was to expose God's grace.
[time=1991] You know, God saved tax collectors and sinners.
[time=1995] Jesus went to the prostitutes and the tax collectors, the sinners. They were the people that he came to save.
[time=2003] Perhaps this was revealing his grace, you know, whether you're a prostitute or a dishonest dad or a self-centered teenager.
[time=2016] The reality is you're separated from God, and by his grace, he saves us all. We're all in the same condition apart from him.
[time=2027] So perhaps he was exposing his grace. In Hebrews 11, it says that she was an immoral woman.
[time=2037] Some people had said that maybe she was an innkeeper, and you might even find a footnote in some of your Bibles.
[time=2042] There might be a footnote that says perhaps this word is innkeeper, not prostitute.
[time=2046] It doesn't fit very well because Hebrews 11 and James both call her an immoral woman.
[time=2053] Probably a prostitute.
[time=2056] And then Jesus, of course, in Matthew 21 came to reach those people like her.
[time=2063] Perhaps it's because she was trustworthy.
[time=2067] Maybe she was somebody that God just chose because she was worthy of entrusting information about these two guys being there.
[time=2076] But you know what the truth is? The word does not reveal why a prostitute.
[time=2082] So your speculations as good as mine.
[time=2088] Was it all right for Rahab to lie? Let's read on.
[time=2098] I'm in chapter 5. That won't work.
[time=2105] Verse 2 of chapter 2, "The king of Jericho was told, 'Look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.'
[time=2111] So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab, 'Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.'"
[time=2121] Verse 4, "But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them.
[time=2125] She said, 'Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.'"
[time=2133] At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left, and I don't know which way they went.
[time=2138] Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.
[time=2143] But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax.
[time=2149] She said, "They were gone, but they were there."
[time=2156] So the men set out and pursued the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone, the gate was shut.
[time=2164] That's verse 7.
[time=2167] She lied.
[time=2170] Was it all right for Rahab to lie? Well, here's my pure speculation on that.
[time=2178] It was a common practice, and many commentators would say that it was just a normal event for people in Canaan to lie.
[time=2191] It was even respected. There are some cultures that respect liars, you know, the people that lie the best get to have the most.
[time=2200] So maybe that was it. Maybe it was just a common practice, and we can justify it that way.
[time=2205] Maybe the spies would have been killed if she told the truth. We can always say that.
[time=2212] But you know what? Again, the word does not reveal. The Bible doesn't tell us why it was all right for Rahab to lie.
[time=2220] Why God used a lie?
[time=2227] No. Rahab hid the Israelite spies.
[time=2236] Rahab lied to protect the spies.
[time=2242] Rahab and the citizens of Canaan were afraid of Israel. Look at verse 8.
[time=2248] Before the spies laid down for the night, she went up on the roof and said to them,
[time=2254] "I know that the Lord has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us
[time=2260] so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you."
[time=2269] We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea. Folks, it's been a minimum of 40 years since that took place.
[time=2280] And these people are east of the Jordan, nearer the Dead Sea. They're a long way from the Red Sea.
[time=2294] And she says to these two spies, "We melt in fear because of what your God did more than 40 years ago."
[time=2308] We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to Saihan and Ag. The two kings of the Amorites, east of the Jordan, they captured them.
[time=2318] They'd annihilated their armies. God did that through them. And the word had spread,
[time=2327] whom you completely destroyed.
[time=2334] When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed because of you.
[time=2340] For the Lord, your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. I want you to catch that phrase.
[time=2348] Rahab understood something about their God because of what she'd heard about them and what he'd done for them.
[time=2359] He'd been doing that in the Old Testament. He did that forever in the Old Testament. He chose to bless his people
[time=2366] and have a relationship with his people as evidence to the people who weren't his people, that he was God.
[time=2375] And she says, "The God of heaven and earth." It caused me this week to wonder how often I kind of limit my God to heaven or earth.
[time=2393] See, sometimes I think I limit my God to the God of this earth. And what I want from him is what the world can provide for me.
[time=2404] And what I want from him is what I desire to have because of my worldliness, my own flesh.
[time=2412] Sometimes I limit him to what he can do for me on this earth.
[time=2420] Sometimes I pray these prayers. I'll pray things like, "I want health for my family. I want wealth for my family. I want protection for my..."
[time=2431] And I want the God of this earth to protect and to bless.
[time=2440] And he is the God of this earth. He's also the God of heaven.
[time=2445] And I need to worship the God of heaven. And I need to realize that the God of heaven may bless me in ways that seem absolutely opposite what I'm praying for.
[time=2458] Have you ever prayed for your kids this prayer? Oh God, I want them to know you better.
[time=2464] I want them to be mature in Christ. And then you read passages of the Scripture that say maturity comes through perseverance, through pain, through suffering.
[time=2472] And you go, "I don't think I want to pray that prayer. Let me change that prayer." But if you believe in the God of heaven, the forever God, see, I pray differently when I pray to the forever God than I do when I pray for the God of this earth.
[time=2491] And he's both. And Rahab, Rahab got that.
[time=2498] When your wife has breast cancer, and you don't get it, and you want desperately for the God of this earth to take it away, he might do that.
[time=2512] But when we pray to the God of forever, he may do it differently than we want him to do it.
[time=2519] The question is, do you have a relationship with the God of heaven and earth?
[time=2527] Or do you have a relationship with the God of the earth, or just the God of the heaven?
[time=2533] Rahab, incredible woman, understood something about God because of two major events that he did through the children of Israel.
[time=2541] Parting the Red Sea, and wiping out, "Ogg and Zion."
[time=2551] Rahab begs for her family after that. In chapter 2, verses 12 and 13, let's read that.
[time=2557] Verses 12 and 13 say, "Now then, please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family because I have shown kindness to you."
[time=2567] "Give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, I do that, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death," she says to these two spies.
[time=2584] The spies agree, verse 14. "Our lives for your lives," they say.
[time=2592] "If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully and when the Lord gives us the land, and faithfully when the Lord gives us the land."
[time=2605] So they agree to her, and then in verses 15 through 21, they give the details of the agreement. Let's read that.
[time=2612] 15, "So that she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall."
[time=2619] Now she had said to them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you, hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way."
[time=2629] The men said to her, "This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us, unless when we enter the land, you have tied the scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down."
[time=2641] The scarlet cord, I found that really fascinating. Somebody this week mentioned to me that they thought it was really interesting that it was scarlet.
[time=2648] So I looked up all the words, all the scarlets in the Old Testament and the New Testament, and it's really amazing.
[time=2657] He talks about using scarlet thread often in garments related to the Ark of the Covenant and in the priest's attire.
[time=2667] He talks about breastplates that are threaded with scarlet thread.
[time=2672] And then scarlet shows up in the New Testament, Jesus wore a scarlet robe, you know that was kind of a symbol for royalty.
[time=2680] They did that mocking him when they put the crown of thorns on his head.
[time=2684] And then Bob Purdy in between services said, "You know that scarlet thread, that scarlet cloth that she marked."
[time=2691] He said, "You know it hadn't been that long before that they'd gone through the Passover and they'd marked their doorways with the blood."
[time=2698] He said, "They'd spot scarlet. It could be.
[time=2709] And unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.
[time=2714] If anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head.
[time=2719] We will not be responsible.
[time=2721] As for anyone who is in the house with you, his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him.
[time=2729] But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear."
[time=2735] Verse 21, "Agreed!" she replied, "Let it be as you say." So she sent them away and they departed and she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
[time=2750] I wonder what she was thinking then.
[time=2757] So they get back to Joshua.
[time=2759] Verse 24, let's skip down there.
[time=2762] Verse 24 says, "They said to Joshua, 'The Lord has surely given the whole land into our hands.'"
[time=2769] Who gave it to them?
[time=2771] The Lord.
[time=2773] They understood where the fear came from.
[time=2776] They understood the melted hearts came from God.
[time=2781] The Lord has surely given the whole land into our hands.
[time=2784] All the people are melting in fear because of us.
[time=2789] So they report back to Joshua.
[time=2792] What's the result of these spies and Rahab's courageous risk?
[time=2801] What we find out in chapter 6 is that indeed her whole household is spared.
[time=2810] The Israelites recognize the scarlet cord and they protect that household and they don't die.
[time=2818] In addition to that, Rahab shows up in the lineage of Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus.
[time=2830] Rahab in Matthew chapter 1 shows up in Joseph's lineage.
[time=2837] Same woman.
[time=2840] That's pretty incredible.
[time=2843] And then in Hebrews chapter 11, Rahab shows up again.
[time=2848] This time she's, you know, that's the hall of faith, that faith chapter.
[time=2853] And Rahab, her faith was credited to her as righteousness as the other's people in that chapter's faith were credited to them as righteousness.
[time=2863] She had faith in a God of heaven and on earth.
[time=2868] And she placed her trust, listen to this, in the fact that he was truly going to do through his people what he said he was going to do.
[time=2880] She didn't think Jericho was going to stand up against them.
[time=2885] She believed that God, by faith, that God of heaven and on earth, was going to do what he said he was going to do through those people.
[time=2892] And that her people were going to be destroyed.
[time=2899] Would you like to have your name in Hebrews chapter 11?
[time=2904] And then she's also an example of faith put into practice because in James, the book of James is about making sure that your faith is lived out in your works.
[time=2917] And he uses Rahab as an example in chapter 2 verse 25, that she was a woman who put her faith in action, hid the spies, tied the scarlet cord on there, and trusted God.
[time=2933] Well, what's the result of the spies' risk?
[time=2936] Go back to chapter 2 again, would you please? Look at 22 and 23.
[time=2943] When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days.
[time=2947] I find that really interesting, three days.
[time=2949] I wonder what all's going on in this chapter, scarlet, three days, getting us to think about Christ.
[time=2957] When for three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them, then the two men started back.
[time=2967] They went down out of the hills, forwarded the river, and came to Joshua, son of none, and told him everything that had happened to them.
[time=2975] And that's when they said to Joshua, "The Lord has surely given the whole land into our hands.
[time=2981] All the people are melting in fear because of us." You know, I was thinking about people that take risks because they believe in the God of Heaven, the forever God, and the God of Earth.
[time=3002] People are willing to take risks. You and I are willing to take risks because we really believe there's a reward.
[time=3010] Risks always precede a perceived reward of some kind.
[time=3018] Are you meditating on the Word so you can be strong and courageous?
[time=3032] Are you willing to take the risks here because He has told us that we are His instrument to reach seekers, saved and searching, helping them find and follow Christ?
[time=3052] Are you really filled up with His Word? Is your mind renewed? Have you been meditating on it like chapter 1 says so that you are thinking about the forever God, the God of Heaven, when you live out life on this plane down here on the earth?
[time=3069] I love meditation. I used to watch cows meditate.
[time=3077] If you've ever seen cows meditate, they chew and they swallow, and then they don't go down for another bite. They just bring the old stuff back up.
[time=3097] They meditate on it. That's what that word really meant to bring it up again and again.
[time=3102] There's some incredible stuff that happens to a cow. I just learned this after first service too because a veterinarian told me this. This is good.
[time=3109] There's some chemical stuff going on in that cud that's brought back up.
[time=3113] If a cow's sick or isn't really eating the way it should be, you can take some of that cud from a cow who isn't sick, put it in the mouth of a cow that is sick, and they start getting well.
[time=3126] I don't know, that's a little sick.
[time=3130] The point is they bring it back up and what happens when you chew the cud, when cows chew the cud, there's some chemical things that take place, and they'll bring it back up and chew it again, and some new chemical reactions take place.
[time=3146] And milk out of that. What an amazing thing. Are you meditating? Are you chewing on the word? Are you bringing it back up during the week so that your mind's renewed?
[time=3161] And when you bump into events that are threatening, you've been chewing on the word and you've got the forever God in mind.
[time=3171] And so you're willing to take the risks. Mike and Carolyn Ballast, you know I was talking about Philippines earlier with that Alamo team, Mike and Carolyn Ballast, Mike was a teacher at Fort Wayne Christian School down the road.
[time=3187] And they went here to church, across the street then. I don't think we were over here yet. I'm sure we weren't.
[time=3193] And Mike and Carolyn were called by God. They're our missionaries, you know. They're out there now in the Philippines representing it. They're there today.
[time=3202] They're building the kingdom in the Philippines. Now remember, their kids were little.
[time=3210] And they were going to load them up and take them to the Philippines to build the kingdom there.
[time=3220] I remember a couple that I heard 30 years ago say, we're going to load up and go to Papua New Guinea and translate the word and we're going to have our babies there.
[time=3233] They didn't have any yet. They had them there. They raised them there. The risk they took.
[time=3238] When Mike and Carolyn went to the Philippines, they were risking what seems normal for us in raising their children.
[time=3246] And they took that risk. And you know what? The Japanese weren't there. They weren't the enemy.
[time=3254] As a matter of fact, truthfully, the Japanese weren't the enemy even when our soldiers were held captive.
[time=3263] The Japanese were the captives of the enemy.
[time=3269] And I've been thinking so much about this week. I wonder what's harder.
[time=3275] I wonder if it was harder for the two spies to go into Jericho?
[time=3279] Or was it harder for Mike and Carolyn to take their kids to the Philippines?
[time=3284] Or is it really harder for you tomorrow morning to take the risk in your arena of influence to stand up for the forever God?
[time=3298] I don't know what's harder, but I do know the source for making all that possible.
[time=3305] It's the person of God. It's not you. It's not your strength. It's not your courage.
[time=3309] It's you with a renewed mind. It's you with a meditative spirit dwelling on the truths of the Word of God.
[time=3317] And his spirit filling you up and empowering you to take the risk tomorrow morning because it's a risk.
[time=3325] It's not normal to be Christ-like out there.
[time=3331] He says we're strangers and aliens in this world.
[time=3336] It's not normal to take the risk to speak the truth when you feel the urge and you think, but if you've been meditating on the Word,
[time=3345] if you've been bringing it up, if you've been chewing on it over and over again, you can be strong and courageous.
[time=3352] Now remember this.
[time=3355] The people in your area of influence are not your enemy.
[time=3361] They are captives.
[time=3364] Since Adam and Eve disobeyed God, people have been taken captive by the enemy.
[time=3375] Satan, this world's philosophy and our own flesh are the enemy.
[time=3385] Don't see threatening people as enemies.
[time=3390] You need to pray for threatening people. Jesus taught us that.
[time=3394] You need to love people that hate you. Jesus taught us that. They're not the enemy.
[time=3403] They're taking captive by the enemy.
[time=3409] I don't know what's harder.
[time=3412] Spies for Joshua.
[time=3417] Missionaries to the Philippines or Papua New Guinea or Uganda or anyplace else on the earth.
[time=3428] Or you needing to live out your faith in the arena to which God has called you this afternoon and tomorrow.
[time=3439] But I do know the source.
[time=3442] I don't know what's harder, but I know the source of your courage and your strength.
[time=3449] I know who you can rely on so that you can take the risks that he's called you to take.
[time=3457] The forever God who works on the earth as well.
[time=3463] Our Father in Heaven, we bow down before you.
[time=3472] We're in awe of the stories that we read. They're not stories. They're events.
[time=3478] They're not fabrications. They're realities.
[time=3482] As we meditate on those and we get stronger because of it, God, I really believe we are enabled by your Spirit.
[time=3489] To then live out our faith.
[time=3492] Do what James teaches us to do to work out our faith.
[time=3497] Being salt and light.
[time=3500] God, I pray that every person in this room would meditate on your word so that your thoughts become our thoughts.
[time=3508] Your ways become our ways and will then take risks to set the captives free.
[time=3518] To build your kingdom and to honor you, please help us do that.
[time=3523] In Jesus' mighty name, I pray. Amen.
