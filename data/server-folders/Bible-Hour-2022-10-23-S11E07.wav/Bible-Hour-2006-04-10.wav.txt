[time=101] [MUSIC]
[time=109] Well good morning everybody, welcome again to the Bible Hour. I'm so thankful that you've tuned into the broadcast.
[time=116] And today as you watch this, it is a very, very special day.
[time=120] Probably the most significant day of the year, and that is Resurrection Sunday. Today is Easter.
[time=127] And I am so thankful to be able to spend this time with you here as we begin to celebrate this amazing day.
[time=134] I want you to know that it was about a week, week and a half ago that my family and I, we were down in Florida celebrating spring break.
[time=143] And it was, it was beautiful. It was absolutely sunny every day, 80, 81, 82 degrees, a little bit of breeze.
[time=151] We were in a condo down there, and we were able to swim during the day if we wanted to.
[time=156] We could go to the beach with friends, we could play paddle ball, we could play in the waves.
[time=160] We could just be in the sun, which you know most of us around here don't get to do much of that for the last four or five months or so.
[time=168] Anyway, we're down there in the middle of this amazing week in the midst of the sun and the fun and the swimming.
[time=175] And my son and I, my oldest son and I were talking in the car going back and forth from somewhere.
[time=181] And he says to me, "Dad, would you want to live here?" And I thought about it for a little bit, and he and I had this really, I think poignant conversation about it.
[time=192] And you know what, as he told me what he thought, and as I answered his question and told him what I thought, we decided, no.
[time=199] And when he said why, he goes, "That's kind of how I feel too, but I don't know how to say it."
[time=205] And then as we thought about it and talked about it, it became really, really clear.
[time=208] It seems as if everybody there where we were down there in Siesta Key, it's like everybody's always visiting, and there's not that sense of home.
[time=220] There's not that sense of community.
[time=222] It's like everybody's passing through, everybody's there for a week or two.
[time=226] Everybody's coming or going, and then you just begin to realize how much you enjoy and how much you like and appreciate home.
[time=234] And not just home, but a community of people that you live and share your life with.
[time=240] And it just reminded me and him of how grateful we are for this community here.
[time=245] In Fort Wayne, yes, but the community of people that we get to spend and share our lives with here at Blackhawk.
[time=252] And I realize today as you watch this, you may be on your way, getting dressed or getting ready to go and celebrate Easter
[time=261] with a community of people that you know and love.
[time=264] I also know that there are many of you out there watching this morning, and you have nowhere to go.
[time=269] You don't have a lot of friends. There aren't a lot of family close by.
[time=274] For whatever reason you find yourself this morning today, right here in this moment, very disconnected from people
[time=281] and living a life for the most part detached and alone and separated from meaningful and encouraging and helpful relationships.
[time=291] And I just want you to know that we care about you, and I would love nothing more than to be able to, and we would love nothing more
[time=300] than to be able to in the days and weeks to come maybe get to know you better.
[time=304] I would like to have a place, provide a people, provide an opportunity for you to connect and to build some friendships
[time=311] and to find some people who would be willing to live and share life together with you.
[time=316] You know, as you watch this, there's still time for you this morning.
[time=320] I would invite you to just watch the broadcast, grab some breakfast, you know, put on some clothes and come and join us
[time=327] for what will be an amazing morning of celebrating this greatest event of all, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the event that brings life and hope for us.
[time=338] But also it's a chance for you to come and meet some new people.
[time=341] We would love to be able to kind of put some names with some faces, introduce you to some folks
[time=347] who may be able to come alongside you in your life, whether you're young, whether you're a student, whether you're a middle-aged
[time=353] family, senior adult, either way, come and allow us this morning the chance to meet you
[time=359] and see what maybe God might have for us in the days to come.
[time=363] We love the community of people that God has allowed us to be a part of.
[time=367] We don't want to be a people who are just kind of passing through.
[time=370] We'd love for you to come and find here at Blackhawk, a place that you could call home and people you could call your friends.
[time=376] So come, nine o'clock, ten forty-five this morning, Easter Sunday, and we'll look forward to having you with us.
[time=389] Hosanna, Hosanna, to the land that we stay.
[time=399] Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus, I am your Hosanna.
[time=411] We're going to take a look at a video together that reminds us of what Jesus' entry into Jerusalem might have looked like.
[time=446] [MUSIC - 325 seconds]
[time=785] Amen. Thank you, Corbin. Thanks, Brennan.
[time=790] Hey, everybody. It's so good to see you.
[time=793] It's been a great couple of weeks for me personally, for our family, we've had a chance to get away, and it is great to be back, and it's good to see all of you. I don't know if I've ever told you this, but maybe it's just the years of standing here,
[time=813] but I have this ability. I don't know if it's like a super gift or what, but I can close my eyes. I can be anywhere and see you.
[time=824] It's really true. First of all, you all sit in the same place every single week, so that helps.
[time=832] But I can close my eyes, and I'm very visual.
[time=837] If you know me at all, if you've ever been in my office, you've been in my room. Anybody who knows me knows, I just love pictures. In fact, even when we pack up for vacation, we just got back from being down in Florida.
[time=850] I take pictures to the condo from our house, of our family. I love being around pictures, and I have a picture in my mind of you.
[time=863] I want you to close my eyes, and I can see you.
[time=868] It's great to be able to have you in my mind and in my heart.
[time=873] I'm so thankful for the times that we get to spend together.
[time=877] I know from many of us, those times are here in this setting, but I want you to know, I look forward to getting back to this setting.
[time=886] It's good to see you, and it's great to be in this room.
[time=890] I know we're missing a few. I'm sure making their way back from wherever they went today, but it is good to be with you.
[time=897] We had a great time down south. It was 81 every day.
[time=901] Little breeze. We were down there in Florida, little beach, little pool.
[time=905] All that was great. I'll tell you what, when we hit Maple Crest, extra day, our entire car erupted in cheers.
[time=914] I mean that. We love getting to get away, but it's the honest truth.
[time=919] I think they were cheering because they were home and they were scared to death.
[time=922] I was going to fall asleep while I was driving and kill us all.
[time=926] I think they were yelling about that, too.
[time=929] Recently, I've, I would say recently, I'd say the last few months.
[time=935] I have been, I've been on a learning, I've been on a learning binge.
[time=941] I don't know what kind of binges you go on. I go on several.
[time=944] One of them lately has been a learning binge.
[time=948] And I'll say this to you. I hope nobody in the room.
[time=952] I hope nobody in the room ever gets too old to learn.
[time=957] You're not going to do that, are you? You're going to keep learning, right?
[time=962] Everybody in the room understands that there is so much still for you and I to see and to listen to and to catch and to grow from.
[time=972] There is so much out there that God has made available for us to see and to come into contact with. And there's so much here in His word for us to learn.
[time=983] So many lessons still that He wants to teach us.
[time=986] And I just pray and hope that you will be a learner for life.
[time=990] I hope that wherever you go, whatever you do, however old you get, you will keep learning.
[time=996] I have, in recent years, just committed that to be one of my own personal core values.
[time=1002] I want to value learning. I want to read. I want to watch.
[time=1006] I want to do whatever I've got to do to allow Him to keep growing and expanding my heart and mine.
[time=1011] And recently, I've been learning and re-learning some things about Jesus.
[time=1019] Just about our Lord, about Him personally, about the way He conducted Himself,
[time=1025] about the way He thought, about the way He led, about the way He taught.
[time=1031] And I've been doing that as I've studied some, I've been studying different passages, I've been listening to different CDs, I've been watching different DVDs, I've been just trying to expand my heart and mind as it relates to the person and work of Christ.
[time=1045] And it's helped me see some very, very important Biblical, I think, life principles
[time=1051] that I've needed to become reacquainted with.
[time=1054] And in some cases, some things I've needed to see for the very first time.
[time=1058] And I want you to see this morning some of these things, some of these character qualities, a few character qualities that the Lord possessed, that I want us to see and be reminded of today as we once again observe His approach and His attitude in the midst of this Passover week.
[time=1076] This holy week, this time where He prepares Himself, as it were,
[time=1084] for the passion and for this sacrifice that He is about to make as we come to Palm Sunday.
[time=1091] As Corbin mentioned, today is a day many refer to as Palm Sunday.
[time=1096] My friends, this is an extremely significant day.
[time=1101] And I hope you realize that.
[time=1103] I want you to stop this morning and just, and I want you just to consider a few things that I, maybe you already have been thinking this, maybe this morning as you made your way here, these were the thoughts that were on your mind.
[time=1113] If not, I want to just guide you in this direction if I can.
[time=1116] In Mark 11, in my Bible, the heading says the triumphal entry.
[time=1121] You see, this is the day where Jesus comes into Jerusalem,
[time=1127] knowing all that would transpire, knowing all that was about to take place.
[time=1131] This is the day where Jesus, the Messiah, the King of Kings, makes His way into Jerusalem.
[time=1138] And in the Scriptures, it's oftentimes referred to as the triumphal entry.
[time=1145] This is viewed as a great triumph.
[time=1149] This is a victory, and I want to just ask you this morning, maybe the obvious, maybe it's not, but why?
[time=1157] Why so triumphal?
[time=1159] Why is this such a victorious event?
[time=1164] What is the significance of this triumphal entry?
[time=1170] Well, I think you don't need to go too far here in your thinking.
[time=1174] I think one of the most obvious things that comes to probably most of our minds is the fact that there was one, namely Satan, who had tried so hard
[time=1188] and thrown so much effort at and done so many things to try and dissuade,
[time=1195] to try and move our Lord away from this purpose that He had come to fulfill.
[time=1203] I mean, you just think about the temptations there, where the enemy, where Satan comes
[time=1209] and meets Jesus there in the wilderness.
[time=1211] You think about the temptations that He faced.
[time=1214] You think about all the people who came along trying to move Him in different directions.
[time=1219] You see, if you want to say it, say it this way, Satan had as His main goal.
[time=1224] Now the thing He was most focused on was trying to move in such a way to get Jesus to a place where Jesus wouldn't finish.
[time=1237] And yet there He hangs, as I'm watching that video earlier, there He hangs in one of those last words, one of the last phrases
[time=1246] that He utters is, it is what?
[time=1250] He did it.
[time=1253] See, He stayed the course.
[time=1256] He did what the Father called Him to do.
[time=1260] And He knew, writing into Jerusalem that morning,
[time=1266] that He had already, by God's grace and by God's strength, overcome a great deal.
[time=1272] And it was a triumph.
[time=1275] It was a victory, my friends.
[time=1277] And you and I should celebrate in our hearts today.
[time=1281] It was part of God's redemptive plan.
[time=1283] I hope you realize that.
[time=1285] Many of you in the room do.
[time=1287] Some of you may not.
[time=1290] See, God's redemptive plan.
[time=1292] God's plan, what I mean by redemptive plan.
[time=1294] God's plan for salvation, my friends.
[time=1298] His way of redeeming the human race.
[time=1300] See, what had to be done was that there had to be a sacrifice.
[time=1304] The perfect lamb had to be slain.
[time=1307] The Son of God Himself, Jesus Christ, had to be crucified.
[time=1312] And He wasn't going to get crucified if He didn't come to where?
[time=1317] Jerusalem.
[time=1320] And Satan knew that.
[time=1322] The enemy knew that.
[time=1323] And our Lord knew that.
[time=1324] And thus the battle that rages.
[time=1327] And thus the heading here in my Bible, above chapter 11 of Mark, the triumphal entry, He had won.
[time=1337] And I am personally, and I know many of you in the room are so very grateful
[time=1344] for Palm Sunday.
[time=1345] So very thankful for the battle that He fought and for His willingness to stay the course.
[time=1351] Let me read this for you, can I?
[time=1353] And would you stand in honor of God's Word, Mark 11?
[time=1359] I want you to see something this morning about Palm Sunday and the commitment of our Lord to Palm Sunday, to Him entering into Jerusalem and all
[time=1370] that would transpire.
[time=1371] Mark 11, verse 1, "As they approached Jerusalem at Beth-phage and Bethany
[time=1377] near the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples and said to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find a cult tied there on which no one yet has ever set.
[time=1389] Untie it and bring it here.
[time=1392] If anyone says to you, why are you doing this?
[time=1395] You say the Lord has need of it, and immediately He will send it back here.
[time=1399] They went away and found a cult tied at the door outside in the street.
[time=1403] And they untied it.
[time=1405] Some of the bystanders were saying to them, "What are you doing untying the cult?" And they spoke to them just as Jesus had told them, and they gave them permission.
[time=1413] They brought the cult to Jesus and put their coats on it, and He sat on it.
[time=1419] And many spread their coats in the road, and others spread leafy branches, the palm branches, which they had cut from the fields.
[time=1427] Those who went in front and those who followed were shouting, "Hosanna,
[time=1433] Hosanna, blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=1437] Blessed is the coming kingdom of our Father David, Hosanna in the highest."
[time=1445] Verse 11 says, "Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple,
[time=1451] and after looking around at everything," I thought that was interesting.
[time=1458] What do you think is going on there?
[time=1461] He's in the temple.
[time=1464] It's this week that He's entering into.
[time=1470] There's nobody there.
[time=1472] He says He came into the temple, and after looking around at everything, just picture Him standing there in the middle of the temple and just turning and looking at everything.
[time=1482] Think about that. We'll come back to that.
[time=1484] He left for Bethany with the Twelve since it was already late.
[time=1490] Father, God, we stand before You again so grateful to be here in this place as a family.
[time=1499] Gathered here to worship You, Father, gathered here to make much of You.
[time=1505] Gathered here to, if it be Your will today, God, to have our hearts and our minds and our souls grown and comforted and pointed in new directions
[time=1516] and reminded and taught, God, we gather here to see what it is You would have for us.
[time=1522] And we are so grateful for the privilege to do so.
[time=1525] Father, we are so grateful that Your Son was willing in His amazing mix of humanity and divinity.
[time=1535] God, that He was willing to choose to get on that cult and ride into that city.
[time=1541] We realize what it symbolizes. We realize what it meant and what it means today to us.
[time=1546] We realize the victory, even there that was one.
[time=1551] And God, as we look at His life and as we look today closely at some things that we observe in His character and in His thinking.
[time=1560] Father, God, I pray that You would open our thinking and our character and our hearts.
[time=1566] Please, please grow us into the people You've called us to be, in Your Son's name we pray.
[time=1572] Amen. You can be seated.
[time=1576] Like I said to you before, I want you to see something here in the Scriptures this morning about Jesus and His commitment to Palm Sunday.
[time=1586] My friends, we see something as you read through the pages of Scripture, as you study and you become a little bit more familiar with His life.
[time=1594] We see something in Jesus that I believe you should and I should possess more of.
[time=1603] I want you to see this this morning and to begin the look here, I want you to turn to Luke 4.
[time=1611] And as I mentioned earlier, I want to just say this to you again as I mentioned earlier.
[time=1614] The things I want to share with you today, these are things I've learned from others.
[time=1619] I hope that's all right with you.
[time=1622] I hope none of you ever walk in this room and think that every single time I stand up here, I'm just telling you new stuff because I'm not.
[time=1631] There are times when in my study I feel as if God gives me things to share with you that I gleaned from my study and my time with him.
[time=1641] There are other times where I'll always have a pen with me.
[time=1644] I'll always have some paper. There are times when I hear things.
[time=1647] There are CDs I listen to, DVDs I watch, and I just furiously scribble notes because of my desire to share those learnings with you.
[time=1656] And so much of what you'll hear today are things I've been learning recently from others, and I'm so grateful for those others.
[time=1664] Let's learn something here about Jesus and His commitment to Palm Sunday. Can we do that?
[time=1669] Go to Luke 40. Luke 4, we're going to pick it up in verse 40, and we're actually going to go all the way down to 44.
[time=1679] Look at what it says here. While the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him, go back to the beginning.
[time=1694] While the sun was setting, all those, look at that, all, all of those who had any, any.
[time=1708] I want you to see that I want you to realize just in these first few lines we're talking about an enormous number of people.
[time=1715] All those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him and laying His hands on how many of them say it out loud.
[time=1723] Each one. And laying His hands on each one of them, He was healing them. Now watch this verse 41.
[time=1732] Not only was He healing the death, not only was He healing the lame, not only was He healing the paralyzed, not only was He healing the leprosy, not only was He giving sight to the blind, but now we've got spiritual sickness.
[time=1745] Demons also were coming out of many, shouting, "You are the Son of God."
[time=1753] You realize that, right? The demons says in James, "The demons believe in God and shudder."
[time=1762] Some of us may have a hard time admitting it. The demons knew that He was the Christ.
[time=1770] You are the Son of God, but rebuking them, He would not allow them to speak because they knew Him to be the Christ.
[time=1778] When day came, interesting, stop there.
[time=1783] Do you see that? When what came? Say it out loud.
[time=1789] So what had He been, so He had been healing all what?
[time=1794] When day came, having been healing, having laying His hands on each one of them, when day came, Jesus left and went to a secluded place.
[time=1807] And the crowds watched this, and the crowds were so very thankful for the time that He had allotted, and so very willing to honor His need for privacy and rest.
[time=1824] When the crowds were searching for Him, "You understand how this would have worked? I learned, as I listened in recent days, this would have been in a communal setting, and in a communal setting."
[time=1837] I mean, the Word would have traveled fast. The Word would have gotten out that He was healing. The people would have come.
[time=1843] They would have brought their fathers and their mothers. They would have brought their babies. They would have brought their friends.
[time=1848] They had been coming all through the night, and the line was getting even longer.
[time=1853] And when day came, Jesus left, and went to a secluded place, and the crowds were searching for Him, picture this, picture the crowds, picture the thrall of people, making their way through the countryside, looking behind rocks, climbing up on hills.
[time=1870] Where did He go? Where is He?
[time=1875] And they came to Him, they found Him, and they tried to keep Him from going away from them.
[time=1885] Can you just hear it? You're going, you're going, where?
[time=1891] You're going to do what? Jesus, look, just get up on the rock and look down. Look at the line. Look at them.
[time=1901] They need you. They're sick. They're dying. They're hurting.
[time=1908] You know a guilt trip or two got thrown in that mix. They came to Him and tried to keep Him from going away from Him, but let me ask you this before I go to the butt.
[time=1925] Do you ever feel as if pressure or temptation or distraction, do any of you in the room ever feel like pressure or temptation or distraction, somehow in kind of a weird way, they search you out?
[time=1944] They find you? I mean, you're trying your best to do the good thing. You're trying your best to kind of stay there. You ever feel like temptation and distraction and have this uncanny way of finding you and kind of whispering in your ear? What are you doing? Don't go there. Come over here.
[time=1973] But He said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this, what? Say it out loud, for this purpose. My friends, Jesus, it would appear, has a purpose.
[time=1990] Jesus has a very clearly defined, firmly held from what we can gather so far, purpose. He has some clarity in His heart and in His mind. One of the guys I was listening to said it this way. It was very powerful, really.
[time=2009] And it helped me think through some things in my own heart and life. They're begging Him to stay, good people, real needs, extremely viable opportunities for real life changing ministry and He leaves.
[time=2029] And unless, here's what He said, and unless He walked to the next town backwards, it meant He turned His back on them. I've got to go.
[time=2046] I want you to write this down. Bear with me, please, everybody, get a pen. Get a pencil if you can. You don't have to. I'm just asking.
[time=2056] Write this down. Some of you, as you write this, your pen will begin to shake once you realize what I'm having you write. For some of you in the room, this will be a very difficult exercise.
[time=2066] For some in the room, like that, it may even bring a great deal of relief and freedom, but I want you to write this down and think about this as we continue to look at our Lord. You're ready? Write this down.
[time=2077] I don't have to do it all. Write it. I don't have to do it all. Think about that, my friends. Think about this right here in Luke 4, 40 to 44, listen, He doesn't meet all the needs.
[time=2105] There were some needs there in that setting that got unmet. There were some expectations that people had in that setting that were not fulfilled.
[time=2118] There were some disappointed people as He exercises this focus and this commitment to the purpose that God had called Him to. How does He do this?
[time=2133] Better ask, maybe why? Why does He do this? Well, here's your answer. I've already told you, but I'm going to tell you again, and I want to show it to you instead of telling it to you. Look at Luke 9.
[time=2144] Matthew, Mark, Luke. We're in Luke. Just go back a few pages. Go to Luke 9.51.
[time=2149] Let's follow through. I'll look up here on the screen. Let's go through a few of these. Here's why He does this. Here's why He walks away.
[time=2158] Luke 9.51. It says, "When the days were approaching for His ascension, it's time that the day was coming and He knew it was near when He would ascend, when He would go back to be with the Father.
[time=2172] And He knew it was time. And it says that when the days were approaching for His ascension, He was determined.
[time=2181] Now, this word determined in the Greek there. This word determined. It means there is a physical and there is an emotional passion for you to get on the treadmill four times a week.
[time=2199] Run two miles, knock off the chocolate, give up the Coke, no more fries. It takes great determination, a mix of mental and emotional with physical passion to do this thing that's important.
[time=2215] He was determined to go where? Say it. Jerusalem. We learn in Luke 9.51 that He was determined to make it to Jerusalem. 13.22.
[time=2231] And He was passing through from one city and village to another, teaching and proceeding on His way to where? Say it out loud.
[time=2242] Jerusalem, think about it for a moment. What we saw in Luke 4, what we see in Luke 4, this healing, this ministry, He's teaching, He's healing, He's encouraging, He's leading, He's going from one village, what does it say?
[time=2259] And He was passing through from one city and village to another. Think about it. He does this again and again and again.
[time=2269] Ministers, Heels, Teaches, steps away to seclusion. They come and find Him. Hey, come back. There's more. Sorry. God, I what? Got to go. I've got to get to where? Say it louder.
[time=2284] Jerusalem. 17-11. Luke 17-11, write it down. While He was on the way to say it loud. Jerusalem. He was passing between Samaria and Galilee.
[time=2297] After Luke 17-11 comes 18-31, Luke 18-31, then He took the 12 aside and He said to them, "Behold, we are going up to what?" Jerusalem and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.
[time=2316] He was on His way to Jerusalem. It had always been that way. It was that way from the beginning. And everywhere He went, whatever He was doing, wherever He healed, wherever He taught, wherever He ministered,
[time=2329] it was always on the back or better said, forefront of His mind. He had to get to Jerusalem. 19-28. Luke 19-28, there you have it.
[time=2342] After He had said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to where? Jerusalem.
[time=2352] Here's how He walks away from the line of lame, blind, sick people. Here's how He deals with the expectations of some.
[time=2369] Here's how He deals with the disappointment that maybe some were communicating and His choices. See, the way He deals with that. What's behind all that is there is, as He relates and as He ministers and as He does what He does, there is this one, there is this one driving, all encompassing, all consuming focus.
[time=2397] He is so very, very focused. He is so very intentional in what He does. And there is one. He has come to honor the Father. He has come to obey God. And God has sent Him to do one very, very important thing.
[time=2417] And so, that one very important thing requires that He go to Jerusalem. And so, you see it throughout the pages. Wherever He goes, He heals, got to go to Jerusalem. Wherever He teaches, got to go to Jerusalem. All through the Gospels, you see Him with this deep driving passion to get to Jerusalem.
[time=2436] He orients everything toward getting to Jerusalem. All interactions, every choice, every opportunity, every offer, every ask, every invite gets put through one grid. Does it help me or hinder me?
[time=2452] In my commitment to get to where? Jerusalem. He needed to get to Jerusalem the right way at the right time.
[time=2464] It affects what He said yes to. It affects what He said no to. His life, His life is about this. There is a mission. And it is so clear. And it is so prevalent. It is so at the front of everything He encounters.
[time=2487] Let me ask you this question. You can write it down if you'd like. I think it'll be on the screen. What's the one thing you, not me, you, what's the one thing you are clearly about?
[time=2506] And you know what? I went by this too fast, first hour. And this, the way I asked it there, it's kind of borderline cliche. So I'm not going to go by this too quickly, this hour.
[time=2522] Because that is not, it may seem kind of cliche, but it's not cliche, my friends. This is a very, very important question. And I'm just going to have you sit there and look at that and think about that.
[time=2543] Because here's the deal. You know what? Let's be honest about this. That's all of us just shoot straight. You and I, we are clearly about something.
[time=2557] Your choices, your thoughts, your priorities, your money, your relationships. You know what? They all tell a very, very clear story. You, you, my friend, you are clearly about something.
[time=2580] What? If I stayed with you, if I came over to your, if I lived with you for a week, it's a scary thought, isn't it?
[time=2592] Wouldn't that be, that'd be kind of fun? If I was with you, just, or anybody, forget me. Somebody was just with you 24/7.
[time=2609] I just got a little scary, didn't it? Somebody was with you 24/7, and they heard it all, and they watched it all, and they took it all in. What are they going to walk away saying you are clearly about?
[time=2630] Jesus, my friends, here write this down. I'm just going to ask you to write a few things down as we go. Jesus, write this down. Jesus was focused. Jesus was focused. I want you to write that down. Jesus was focused.
[time=2651] He had come to make his way to Jerusalem, and you see it everywhere he goes. How about you? Now, some of you are sitting here in the room going, "Okay, I get your point. I know I'm supposed to be about something good or right or God honoring, but I don't know enough. Like, hell, help me out here.
[time=2676] I want to go with you, Kelly, so tell me, what should I be about?" Okay, here you go. Some of you don't need this help. Some of you just went five pages past me. Awesome. You've got some things already working in your mind. Great. For others of you, here you go. 1 Corinthians 1031. Just write it down. 1 Corinthians 1031.
[time=2698] Rather than you eat or drink, whatever you do, do all to the glory of who? 1 Corinthians 1031. In everything that you do, it says, whether you eat or drink, in whatever you do, work, home, leisure, public, private, wherever you are, it says whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[time=2723] Have what you're doing. Be something that brings great glory to him. So there you go. Try that for a week. I'm asking you. I'm inviting you to do that for a week. Have your singular driving purpose be that in the choices I make and the places I go and the things that I think I'm going to be a 1 Corinthians 1031 follower of Christ.
[time=2750] Just write 1031 all over your world. And have that be your one thing this week to bring great, to make much of God in everything that you choose, wherever you go, whatever it is that you do. Jesus, my friends, was so very focused.
[time=2776] You know, the amazing thing, and I learned this as I listened and as I read several individuals in the last month or so.
[time=2785] The amazing thing is that you begin to see this pattern of focus, this, this, for so many of us in the world, I'll just use my hands. For so many of us in the room, our lives, our lives are like this. Anybody's life like this in the room today?
[time=2803] My lives are like this and his life, the more you read and the more you observe him, his life is so focused. It's simple.
[time=2816] And you see it in a number of, not only do you see it in the Jerusalem, got to get to Jerusalem thing, you see it even like in his relationships.
[time=2826] Once again, in the last week or so, go to Matthew 17, would you? First book there in the New Testament, Matthew 17, we're going to look at verses 1 to 9.
[time=2841] We see this focus, we see this priority, we see this simplicity, evidence in his relational life as well. It says in 17, 1, 6 days later, Jesus took with him, are you there?
[time=2855] Peter and James and John, how many did he take? Say it out loud. Three. Six days later, this is a very significant event. Jesus knew that what was about to transpire was a very, very significant, very, very spiritual, very, very important event.
[time=2877] He takes, how many? Peter, James and John, his brother and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. And he, Christ, was transfigured before them.
[time=2888] And his face shone like the sun and his garments became as white as light and behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him and Peter, classic Peter, says to Jesus,
[time=2901] "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."
[time=2911] While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased."
[time=2922] Listen to him. When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground and were terrified and Jesus came to them and touched them and said, "Get up and do not be afraid."
[time=2935] And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus and self alone. And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them. He confides in them. He says, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
[time=2954] We know from the Gospels that Jesus had a very special speaking of relationships, that Jesus had a very special relationship with a very special group of twelve, and they are known to us even today as the twelve, what, the twelve disciples.
[time=2972] Scripture's very clear about that. And then if you go to Luke 10, you can go to Luke 10 later and read about this, and Luke 10, it comes to a point where he calls out and appoints 70 other disciples. Now he adds to the twelve and he appoints 70 to go out and do ministry on his behalf.
[time=2992] And then later you come to Acts, first chapter of Acts, you have a hundred and twenty people who it says were very close to him, and they're there with the disciples and his mother Mary, and they're in that upper room waiting for whatever was supposed to happen.
[time=3010] In Acts 2 we realize what happened, but there's a hundred and twenty in that group. The Gospels also reveal, Matthew 17 would be one place, that among the twelve, or seventy, or even the hundred and twenty for that matter, the Gospels revealed that there was a very special relationship with the what, with the three.
[time=3033] How many times do you see him with Peter, James, and John? Who was he probably closest to? The three.
[time=3048] Who did he, well just ask this, Matthew 17, the transfiguration, one of the most significant things that transpires, I wish we had more time to delve into that with you today, but here's my point, did he take the hundred and twenty up the mountain?
[time=3066] Did he take the seventy? Did he take the twelve? No, he takes the three.
[time=3072] And you know what? You never once, this was good for me, because I've needed to grow in this arena. I need to grow in a lot of arenas. One of the arenas I've needed to grow in is this one. He never apologizes for it.
[time=3090] You never see him running around to the nine that got left going, "Hey guys, are you okay with this?" I mean, I hope he'll still like me when we get back, but I'm going to take the three. You never see him feeling guilty for leaving the hundred and twenty out when he did something with the seven. I mean, there was just a sense of purpose. He can't take seventy people up the mountain.
[time=3117] One of the communicators, one of the teachers I've listened to lately on this, said it really well. It was very, very convicting and very, very good for me to hear. He said as you watch Jesus and as you observe his interactions, it would seem as if he goes deeper and deeper with fewer and fewer people.
[time=3145] Here's the question for you today. How many relationships can you sustain? Really? I mean, real relationships. Can you handle 70? Are you good for 120?
[time=3162] How many people can we stay intimate with? How many people can you stay authentic and connected with? I mean, real, honest, be there for you no matter what kind of friend. How many of those can you have in your life? How many intimate relationships can be sustained? How many folks can you really be connected to spiritually and personally and relationally?
[time=3191] You know what? There are people in this room right now and you're feeling guilty. I know you. I know how you work. You feel guilty often because the 20 notes you wrote last week, you don't think were enough and you're sure that there's four you missed that must think horrible thoughts about you.
[time=3215] There's people in this room and the four or five couples you've tried to get together with in the last two months, you're worried about the three or four you haven't gotten with and what they must be thinking of you.
[time=3228] There are folks in this room who feel a pressure to be so relationally connected because somehow in our minds, see, here's what I learned as I listened, he went deeper and deeper with fewer. We go shallower and shallower with more.
[time=3246] And we somehow think it's community. We somehow think it's relationship. We somehow think something good is going to come out of shallower and shallower with more.
[time=3262] You know what? Enjoy. Listen to me. Enjoy the 12th. Have a blast with the 70. Serve them. Write them a note. Have a good time. Encourage them when you can. Be with the 12th. Enjoy the 120.
[time=3283] I want my friends, unless you are going deep with two or three, unless there are a few in your life who you have bared and you continue to bear your heart to and you know them and they know you and you live, really live life together.
[time=3304] Things get said. Stuff gets shared. Confrontation happens lovingly. Prayers are lifted up. Hands are laid on me unless there's a few that you really, really know.
[time=3321] Then you and I will just keep going shallower and shallower with more and more and our relational heart and our relational lives will mean absolutely nothing.
[time=3333] Jesus had great focus. Jesus had great focus and in that focus was able to accomplish so very much.
[time=3347] Okay, the clock says 11, 10. So somebody tell me what time it is really. I think I have an hour left. What time is it really? 12, 10? All right, so we're done. Gosh, that went quick.
[time=3363] John 5, write this down. John 5, 19, and 20. Here's how you do this, my friends. You know how you do this? You know how he did it? Here's how he did it and here's how you and I can live with this kind of focus and this kind of purpose and this kind of confidence to leave
[time=3380] when we need to leave, to move, when we need to move, to speak when we need to speak, to rest when we need to rest. Here you go, right here. Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, truly, truly I say to you, the son can do nothing of himself
[time=3397] unless it is something he sees the father doing, for here you go, for whatever the father does these things, the son also does in like manner.
[time=3413] What would it be like to be so connected to your heavenly father that you could live and choose and decide with this kind of focus? That connected to his leading and his prompting.
[time=3433] I'll tell you what, through times of personal study and devotion, through times of intimate connection with a small group, through times of worship and instruction here in the gathering, as you give yourself to a kind of relationship with the father, whereby you are growing in your connection to him.
[time=3451] When you live that close to him, then when he nudges, you feel it, when he speaks, you hear it. When you live apart from him, you hear nothing. When he nudges, you miss it.
[time=3466] And you're scattered, write this down, last thing, and we're going to go. Jesus was not distracted. Write that down. Jesus was not distracted. Stand with me, would you?
[time=3478] He was not distracted. He had the right mix of public activity and private seclusion. He had the right mix of speaking and listening. He had the right mix of activity and isolation.
[time=3492] He was not distracted. My friends, my friends, don't be distracted. Stay focused. Stay on course. If you need help, I do. If you do, you've got to ask.
[time=3507] We would love to connect you with some people who could help move you in that direction. Sorry for going late.
[time=3513] Father God, thanks for the time this morning. Take these truths, God, and grow us in our hearts. Thank you for the time we'll have together Friday night. Thank you for the time that we'll have together on Sunday.
[time=3523] Bring just the right people, God, at just the right time to hear this amazing message of forgiveness and sacrifice. We are so grateful that we get to celebrate it. Give us a great week in your son's day, and we pray. Amen.
[time=3543] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=3587] I thought that was going on.
[time=3594] Give that answer again. We're just trying to set your audience.
[time=3596] Okay. I had the opportunity to jump in into a ministry that I felt had a great need, a great possibility for vision. That's good.
[time=3607] Give me one minute here, and then we'll be ready to go.
[time=3613] For a day that you spend looking at that picture. You know, I wake up every morning.
