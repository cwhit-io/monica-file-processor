[time=147] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=242] - I'd like all the ladies in the room to live their voices, sing this chorus.
[time=246] [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=262] - Yeah, they're up from the grave.
[time=263] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]

[time=349] [MUSIC - 102 seconds]
[time=454] (singing in foreign language)
[time=484] [MUSIC - 4 seconds]
[time=491] (audience applauding) - Yeah, you know, there are so many things
[time=512] about Easter that I love.
[time=515] There is so much about the resurrection of Jesus Christ that inspires me.
[time=522] There's so much about this day that I so enjoy.
[time=526] For many of you in the room who know the Lord, for those of you in the room today who live in a fully surrendered relationship with Him, whether that's been for a month or 10 or 30 years, I would imagine in your heart and in your mind as well.
[time=541] There are just some things about this day, maybe a memory from an Easter years ago, maybe the simple truth or truths that surround this event that continue to encourage you in your life.
[time=554] I'm sure there are many in the room who could speak to a number of things that encourage you about this day.
[time=561] I could, but I wanna just tell you one thing this morning.
[time=565] One thing is we begin our time together that is so very encouraging for me as I think about and experience once again this greatest of all days.
[time=574] And that is the clarity, the clarity that Easter brings to all of life and all of life's issues.
[time=585] And here's what I mean by that.
[time=590] The Easter is about the gospel, my friends.
[time=595] You whittle it all down and the Easter Resurrection Sunday is about the gospel.
[time=603] And I love the fact that it brings such clarity.
[time=605] Here it is.
[time=606] Jesus came to earth claiming to be God in the flesh.
[time=611] He said it, the prophets prophesied hundreds of years
[time=617] before it happened, but the basic bottom line truth is that from the very beginning, that's what he said.
[time=623] He came to earth claiming to be God in the flesh first.
[time=628] Secondly, he said he would be killed.
[time=630] The prophets prophesied it, he repeated it.
[time=634] He said that he would die to offer forgiveness and pay the penalty for our sin, a penalty we could never have on our own ever paid.
[time=645] Thirdly, he said that having died, he would be placed in a tomb and be raised back to life on the third day.
[time=654] He said it, prophets prophesied it, he repeated it.
[time=659] And he said, if we believe that to be true, when it's all said and done, he said, if you believe that to be true with all of your heart, he said, if you accept this gift of his sacrifice and follow him, you will be saved.
[time=675] Period.
[time=678] I love the clarity.
[time=681] I love the simple power of the gospel and the message of Easter, because you know my friends, that's what I just said.
[time=690] What we just revisited there quickly, that is the truth for each and every person in this room.
[time=696] And that's what I mean by clarity.
[time=702] See, see, whether you're red, yellow, black, or white, whether you're educated or uneducated, whether you're rich or poor or somewhere in between, whether you have kids or no kids, married or single, single again, no matter who you are, where you've been, what you've encountered, what road you've traveled, it just doesn't matter.
[time=721] That is the truth.
[time=723] And that is a truth.
[time=726] That is a truth that no matter who you are, you or me, we have to come to terms with that truth.
[time=739] That's what you have to embrace and give yourself to, to have healing and hope, to be made new, to be redeemed, to have purpose in real meaning today and eternal, everlasting life with him tomorrow.
[time=753] You fully surrender your heart and soul to the truth of Easter, to the truth of the resurrection.
[time=760] And when you do, he says you will be saved, transformed,
[time=768] made new, and redeemed.
[time=770] Let me read this to you.
[time=772] Originally here this morning, initially not from the gospels, but from Paul's letter to the church at Corinth.
[time=779] Turn to 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=781] You see the church at Corinth, like many of us still today, had questions about the resurrection.
[time=788] And so Paul writes to the church at Corinth and verses one through four, I wanna read this to you, 1 Corinthians 15, one to four.
[time=798] It's, we jump into the great resurrection truth this morning.
[time=801] Would you stand with me in honor of God's word?
[time=804] And in honor of God's word, would you allow me just to read this to you?
[time=808] Paul writes, now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel, there it is, the gospel, which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you are what?
[time=826] Say it.
[time=827] If you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain, for I delivered to you as a first importance.
[time=837] I love that.
[time=838] I love that phrase of first importance.
[time=841] My friends, there are so many things in your life, and there are so many things in my life.
[time=846] Culture and society, they throw so much at us that's trying to somehow make its way to that first place in your life.
[time=854] And Paul says, be reminded of first importance in life.
[time=859] Is this?
[time=861] What I also received that Christ died for our sins
[time=867] according to the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures.
[time=876] And this won't be on the screen, but listen closely to this.
[time=882] And if Christ has verse 17, and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is what?
[time=888] Worthless.
[time=890] You are still in your sins.
[time=892] He was raised.
[time=897] The tomb is empty.
[time=899] And praise God, I'll speak for myself.
[time=902] Praise God, I'm not still in my sins.
[time=905] Father, God, we stand before you this morning,
[time=911] with hearts that are already celebrating.
[time=915] We can sense it in the room this morning, God, a collective sense of gratitude, a united sense of appreciation for this unbelievable gift, not only what took place on Friday, but God, the fruition of that redemptive activity here on Sunday as our Lord Jesus Christ walks out of a tomb and in so doing gives us full forgiveness, absolute healing,
[time=940] hope for today, and hope for tomorrow.
[time=943] God, eternal life, victory over sin and death.
[time=947] And so we gather today to celebrate that very truth.
[time=950] God, as we do so, our hope and our prayer is that you would continue to teach us and grow us in our hearts and lives and that we could in the process of this gathering, bring great glory and honor to you.
[time=963] God, allow us to do that, where it's in your son's name, your risen son's name that we pray.
[time=971] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=973] You know, it was just a couple months ago and I found myself in a programming meeting, programming, our programming team is the team that meets on a weekly basis and we kind of put our hearts and our heads together and there are several of us on that team and we try to think about and plan out as best we can, always allowing God to do what God's gonna do, our services, these times that you see and we give great thought and effort to the songs that are gonna be sung and the message that's gonna be taught that day, I mean, they give thought to what the room's gonna look like.
[time=1006] These folks take this very seriously in their effort, not to look good, but to bring great glory and honor to God and provide an atmosphere that's conducive to you and I learning and being encouraged.
[time=1017] In the midst of one of those meetings, a couple months ago, I was already thinking about Easter, already thinking about this morning and Corbin says to me, "Hey, I got an idea." And as Corbin kind of throws the idea out on the table, it really, really sounded very, very interesting and I felt like even in that initial meeting, it was something that we should pursue.
[time=1038] He said, "We've been singing a song "and we're gonna keep singing this song." It's this song from the Hillsong folks over in Australia and it says, "He lived, he died, he rose again on high." You're saying it already this morning.
[time=1052] He lived, he died, he rose again on high.
[time=1055] Why don't you just take that chorus and why don't you just preach those three great truths?
[time=1063] And why don't you let us, in between each, kind of in some way, artistically, in some way, in a worshipful manner, allow us a chance to reflect, allow us a chance to respond.
[time=1074] And I just thought, "Wow, what a great idea." So that's what we're gonna do.
[time=1077] We're gonna take that first point, he lived.
[time=1080] And then there's gonna be a break and don't get happy, don't think we're done there.
[time=1086] It's just a break and then I'm gonna come back.
[time=1089] And after the second point, I'm gonna sit down, don't get happy, we're not done.
[time=1095] We'll be done after the third point and it's gonna be a great, great morning.
[time=1098] I promise you, I promise you.
[time=1101] God, I believe is in this morning and has He has directed and guided and as we've tried to kind of respond and bring to you this reminder and this teaching and this experience of worship.
[time=1114] I really believe in my heart that many, many of you are gonna be blessed this morning.
[time=1119] So number one, He lived.
[time=1121] He lived, my friends.
[time=1125] This is a great truth.
[time=1127] And this is where I want us to begin this morning.
[time=1130] And where I want you to go in your mind this morning and what I would invite you to think through is not only the fact that historically He lived, there is great truth and implication in the historicity of our Lord.
[time=1141] Jesus of Nazareth was a very real person.
[time=1145] And we could talk about that for hours and I want you to understand that, yes, He lived really, He lived, but this morning I want you to think about.
[time=1153] And this morning, I want us to celebrate the fact that how He lived, the way in which He lived, the manner in which He conducted Himself, the habits and the decisions and the choices and the attitudes, the way that He lived has enormous implication, has enormous brings with an enormous opportunity for you and I this morning.
[time=1178] Here's what I want you to think about.
[time=1182] He lived, our Lord did.
[time=1185] And the scriptures paint this really, really special, very unique, quite amazing picture of a life lived in deep, intimate relationship with the Father.
[time=1200] That's how our Lord lived.
[time=1204] He lived, He faced all that you face.
[time=1207] He encountered all that you and I encounter, real flesh, real person, 100% man, 100% deity.
[time=1214] And in His life, He lived and He faced all that He faced in a deep, intimate relationship with the Father.
[time=1222] We see in the scriptures this oneness, this connectedness that led to obedience and faithfulness and peace.
[time=1231] Look at John 14 with me, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[time=1236] Go to John 14.
[time=1238] John 14, eight, I want you just to see this connectedness.
[time=1248] I want you to see this oneness.
[time=1250] I want you to see the unity in the relationship between him and the Father.
[time=1254] Philip says to him, Lord, verse eight, John 14.
[time=1257] Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father and it is enough for us.
[time=1261] He says, if you'll just show us God, Philip's struggling a little bit here.
[time=1266] Philip's trying to put all the pieces together.
[time=1268] He says, Jesus, if you'll just show us God, it'll all kind of make sense.
[time=1272] It'll really help us.
[time=1274] It is enough for us and Jesus said to him, have I been so long with you?
[time=1279] And yet you have not come to know me, Philip?
[time=1284] He who has seen me has seen the Father.
[time=1287] How can you say show us the Father?
[time=1289] Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?
[time=1295] The words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own initiative, but the Father abiding in me does His works.
[time=1305] Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.
[time=1310] My friends, He lived, that is true.
[time=1314] How He lived, the posture of His heart and life.
[time=1318] So very important for us to consider this morning.
[time=1320] He lived a life full of meaning.
[time=1323] He lived a life full of purpose.
[time=1325] He lived a life of fulfillment and joy.
[time=1328] And yes, He was a man of sorrow acquainted with much grief, but even in the sorrow and grief, there was hope.
[time=1336] And there was hope in the midst of the sorrow and grief because of the relationship that He shared with the Father.
[time=1343] You know, He lived a satisfying life.
[time=1348] Think about that.
[time=1351] What satisfaction Jesus must have sensed that day on the mountain.
[time=1356] We talked about it last week when He takes Peter, James and John.
[time=1360] Remember, He takes them up the mountain and there on the mountain, the transfiguration occurs.
[time=1366] An amazing thing goes on there between God and His Son and these three and the three disciples here through the clouds, the voice of God, and the voice of God says about Jesus, this is my Son in whom I am, what, well pleased?
[time=1382] To have God say I am well pleased
[time=1391] with your life.
[time=1392] What satisfaction, my friends, that was a satisfaction that came as a result of His faithful obedience and deep trust in the Father.
[time=1403] He lived, my friends.
[time=1405] And out of His relationship with the Father flowed a life of contentment, compassion and character.
[time=1412] And guess what?
[time=1413] Guess what?
[time=1414] Because of Easter, my friends, because of the resurrection, you get that life.
[time=1421] He came to live that life so you could have that life.
[time=1426] Now, true, you and I don't get that life fully until we're with Him someday, but in the process leading up to, He promises to grow you, He promises to make you, He promises to develop your heart and mind in the likeness of who's, His.
[time=1445] His life that He lived, in relationship with the Father, He longs to give to you so you can experience that life.
[time=1453] He makes you like Him in relationship with the risen Lord.
[time=1458] He brings fullness where there was once emptiness.
[time=1462] He brings rest to lives once marked by pain.
[time=1465] He brings self-control where there used to be addictions.
[time=1469] He brings purity where there was once only dirt.
[time=1473] He lived, He lived and because He did, and because He lived the way He did, you have the opportunity to live an abundant life.
[time=1485] John 10-10, look at the screen.
[time=1488] The thief comes, again, folks, you can't read this without at least just stopping to be reminded of the fact that there are two forces at work here because there is one force who wants to ruin your life.
[time=1503] We're talking about the way we live.
[time=1505] There is one who would want you to live in a way whereby you would be robbed of all the joy and all the peace and all the meaning and all the satisfaction that He intended.
[time=1516] The thief, the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.
[time=1524] I came, Jesus said, that they may have life and have it, what, say it loudly.
[time=1530] Abundantly, that word abundant means fully.
[time=1534] See, there is a life that He lived and that life that He lived, He wants to give it to you and that life is life as it was intended to be lived and that is a full, abundant, meaningful life.
[time=1555] Seriously, how's your life?
[time=1558] I mean, really, how is your life?
[time=1566] See, Romans 1 says that down deep inside of you,
[time=1573] you know the truth.
[time=1576] God's word is so clear that down deep inside of each of us, there is a realization of what is true and right and what God intended.
[time=1585] So you don't need to be an expert in this to answer that question.
[time=1590] How's your life?
[time=1593] See, we have a tendency in our humanness to listen to the thief and we have a tendency to live life in a way so far.
[time=1605] So far away from what?
[time=1608] Not only He intended but what He has offered.
[time=1611] Don't want you to watch this video.
[time=1615] This video is just a opportunity for you to briefly reflect.
[time=1620] It's a great video because it's just in a very creative way.
[time=1622] It just represents both sides.
[time=1625] It just gives you a picture of where we oftentimes go with the living of our life and it just gives you a great picture and reminder of what God intended and what He still offers today in relationship with this risen Lord whose life we celebrate today.
[time=1641] I'm gonna have you watch it and I'm gonna have you just think about a few things.
[time=1644] I'm gonna give you just a minute or two to reflect and meditate on this truth.
[time=1649] Watch and listen.
[time=1650] - God, who are you?
[time=1657] - Who are you, God?
[time=1660] I was in the beginning.
[time=1662] - Ma'am, I'm not guilty, I didn't do nothing.
[time=1667] - I was sent to proclaim freedom for the prisoners.
[time=1670] - I need your help, I'm hungry.
[time=1673] - I came to preach the good news to the poor.
[time=1676] I am the word of life.
[time=1680] I look at pornography and I can't stop.
[time=1685] - I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[time=1690] - What am I supposed to do?
[time=1691] I have so much money.
[time=1692] - Come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest.
[time=1697] Where are you, God?
[time=1698] I became flesh.
[time=1704] I have cancer, and I'm dying.
[time=1707] - I came to heal, and by my stripes, you are healed.
[time=1712] - Mommy says we can't live with daddy anymore.
[time=1714] - I did not come to condemn the word, but to seek and save what was lost.
[time=1720] - God, don't you love me?
[time=1722] - I made my drawing for long.
[time=1723] - I'll do whatever it takes to be famous.
[time=1729] - If I glorify myself, it means nothing.
[time=1732] I came to glorify God, and my job to failure is not an option.
[time=1736] What good is it for a man to gain the whole world?
[time=1739] Yeah, who's his soul?
[time=1741] Who are you, God?
[time=1742] For this reason I was born.
[time=1744] I came for you.
[time=1747] I came to die and to rise again, so that you may have life.
[time=1761] Well, as Corbin and Hugh begin to play, let me just ask you if you would to bow your heads just for a moment.
[time=1766] And would you, with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, would you just be willing to take just a moment?
[time=1772] And to honestly, before God, identify that one thing,
[time=1779] or those two or three things, maybe it's even an individual.
[time=1785] What is it in your life?
[time=1788] Day after day that attempts to move you away from the life that Christ offers.
[time=1796] What addiction is it, what habit, what pattern is it?
[time=1801] What struggle is it in you?
[time=1803] That the enemy uses, go ahead and name it, visualize it.
[time=1808] What is it that he uses to try and move you away from this life of fulfillment and joy and peace?
[time=1819] And if you're willing this morning to do that, to identify that, would you then be willing to ask for help?
[time=1824] Would you, in your own words, in your own way, in the quietness of your heart before God, would you be willing to ask God for help?
[time=1836] Ask him to bring whoever he might need to bring.
[time=1840] Ask him to change whatever circumstance may need to be changed.
[time=1846] Ask him to give you the strength and courage needed.
[time=1849] Bag him this morning to do whatever he may need to do
[time=1855] to bring you back to this life that his son offered.
[time=1860] Why don't you just have that conversation with him briefly here this morning as these guys play?
[time=1876] (gentle music)
[time=1989] (gentle music) Some of you in the room may have recognized that song.
[time=1994] What a great, great song.
[time=1996] Because he lived, I can face what?
[time=2000] Because he lived all what is gone.
[time=2006] All fear, amen, amen.
[time=2009] First great truth, he lived.
[time=2013] Second great truth, he died.
[time=2019] He died, my friends.
[time=2021] And not only did he die physically and literally, we talked about his literal living, literally physically he died, absolutely, on that cross on Friday, that's true.
[time=2035] I want you to see and sense this morning as well that he died, he died every day of his life.
[time=2041] Because he was one who again and again died to, what?
[time=2046] His self, look at Matthew 1039.
[time=2049] Matthew 1039, some of you may know this, some of you may not, it's the most frequently recorded phrase of our Lord and all of the gospels.
[time=2059] The most frequently recorded phrase, there you have it, Matthew 1039.
[time=2063] He who has found his life will, what?
[time=2067] Will lose it, will give it away.
[time=2069] He who has found his life will lose it and he who has lost his life for my sake will find it.
[time=2076] Sounds a lot like Mark 1045, you can turn there in your bibles if you'd like to.
[time=2081] Mark 1045, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, it says, in Mark 1045, for even the Son of Man,
[time=2094] for even the Son of Man did not come to be served.
[time=2098] He didn't come to get, he didn't come to accumulate, he didn't come to acquire.
[time=2103] Even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many.
[time=2111] This is the mindset, my friends, this is the attitude, this is the way in which he lived.
[time=2118] He lived, yes, and he died.
[time=2119] And he died on the cross, that's true, but he died to himself again and again and again.
[time=2125] And the same truth I told you about on that first point, I want you to see again here on this second point.
[time=2131] In the same way that he teaches us to live by his life, he teaches us as well, you and I today, in this setting, in this culture, in this context, he teaches us how to die by dying to self.
[time=2145] He models for us this willingness to let go.
[time=2150] Philippians two, you can write that down, you can read it later today.
[time=2154] I hope you will, says at the beginning of Philippians two that he did not regard equality with God, a thing to be grasped.
[time=2164] Think just for a moment about all that came, all that could have been acquired, all the benefits, all the perks, all the upside of equality with God, he was 100% divine and yet he viewed equality with God and all that came with it as something not to be in that moment grasped because he was about not getting but giving, he was here to serve it, he was here to give it away, he was here to offer it.
[time=2194] He did not regard equality with God, a thing to be grasped but the text there in Philippians two says he emptied himself.
[time=2203] He emptied himself.
[time=2205] He let go of it all for the sake of others.
[time=2210] In relationship, here's the point my friends, in relationship with the risen Lord, whose life and resurrection we celebrate this morning, he gives you, he gives, he makes available to each and every one of us in this room.
[time=2223] He gives you the strength to empty yourself, to die to yourself for the sake of what's right and good and true.
[time=2233] What some might say are your, many will tell you today.
[time=2237] You're entitled to it, they'll say, it's your right, they'll say, it's not a big deal, just have it, just enjoy it, you should.
[time=2247] And while there are times when you and I should enjoy things, the bottom line pattern of his life was one of being there not to get but to give.
[time=2256] And the same thing can happen in your life and mind today.
[time=2259] We can die to ourselves, a businessman or a business woman.
[time=2263] I mean at this level or, you know, this level or even
[time=2269] at this level, a businessman or a business woman can get to a point where by the grace and strength of God they can say enough is enough.
[time=2279] Enough is enough and they can then turn their hearts and their attentions and their affections toward a family.
[time=2287] They can make decisions, they can exercise values
[time=2293] and they can love a wife or they can love a husband, they can invest in kids, they can give themselves yes to a calling in the corporate sense but they can also build a home spiritually.
[time=2304] They can say at some point, you know what, enough's enough.
[time=2309] I'll die to that because I wanna give myself to this.
[time=2313] A young man or a young woman can choose purity, can you can die to yourself, you can choose purity and self-control in the midst of a culture that has absolutely no room for purity or self-control.
[time=2327] A father and a mother, any fathers and mothers in the room this morning, we may have families, we may have single moms, single dads.
[time=2334] Doesn't matter, a father and mother can model for an on-looking family.
[time=2339] Faithful service and devotion to God when so many other dads and moms seem absolutely lost in the distraction of the chase.
[time=2350] Off they go chasing down this or that while little lives and little hearts watch.
[time=2358] You can draw a line in the sand, you can put a stake in the ground, you can die to self.
[time=2365] You know what, you can keep changing diapers.
[time=2371] Some of you are wondering if it'll ever end.
[time=2376] Some of you are wondering if you can survive one more day of spilled milk and dirty pants and stinky diapers you can.
[time=2385] His strength and his courage are enough.
[time=2388] You know what, you can live in a budget.
[time=2390] You can die to yourself, my friends.
[time=2392] You can financially honor God.
[time=2394] You can say no to certain things and live within a God-honoring budget.
[time=2400] You can die to self because he died to self.
[time=2403] He empowers you.
[time=2404] You can give, it affects your giving.
[time=2408] You can write a check.
[time=2410] You can put money in the plate every week and you can do it at a level that represents sacrifice and gratitude.
[time=2419] No matter how scary it might be, no matter what others might say, he allows you to die to self.
[time=2424] I have an example of this in my own life.
[time=2430] A divorced 68-year-old grandmother with an only son pastoring a church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=2441] When so many other 68-year-olds give themselves to other endeavors, she decides to give her life to teaching English and in the process spreading the gospel in Kabul, Afghanistan.
[time=2457] She puts a turban on her head and makes her way
[time=2465] to the market every other day.
[time=2467] She does so in a setting where others experience great fear of the unknown.
[time=2473] She does so with great trust and a great commitment to do the best she can to exercise the gifts that God has given her.
[time=2482] She does so willingly and she does so at great cost.
[time=2487] I think about my mom often as she gives herself
[time=2493] to this calling that God has placed on her life.
[time=2496] And you know what, whether you're changing diapers or running a business or teaching English in Kabul, because of what our Lord did, you and I can die to ourselves.
[time=2507] We can make great sacrifice.
[time=2510] I want you to listen.
[time=2512] I want you to listen as the band comes and as the choir sings.
[time=2518] And as you listen to this song and as you take this in, my prayer and my hope is that his death, the fact that he died.
[time=2528] I'm not only on the cross but in the everyday of his life.
[time=2531] I pray and I hope you can just in these few minutes be encouraged by that great truth.
[time=2558] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 100 seconds]
[time=2670] (gentle music) - Why don't you stand witness and sing us next verse together?
[time=2691] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 168 seconds]
[time=2867] (audience applauds) - Everybody agreed and said, would you have a seat?
[time=2886] Great point, great truth.
[time=2889] Number one this morning, he lives, my friends.
[time=2893] Number two he died.
[time=2894] He lived, he died, and number three, the greatest of all truths.
[time=2900] The greatest of all truth is that he rose again on high.
[time=2905] Here's what I want you to sense this morning.
[time=2910] This is the one truth I just want you to put your arms around.
[time=2913] My friends, the power of God, because it was God who raised him, the power of God displayed in the resurrection makes that which was beaten, broken, and dead.
[time=2926] That which was, and you saw it on the pictures, that which was beaten, and broken, and dead, and that which is today beaten, and broken, and dead.
[time=2938] For whatever reasons, power of God in the resurrection of Jesus Christ takes that which was beaten, and broken, and dead, and makes it alive, healed, and made new.
[time=2951] That is what the resurrection does.
[time=2954] It takes what was broken, and it heals it.
[time=2957] It takes what was lost and helps it come home.
[time=2960] What God did in raising Jesus on that third day, remember this, and we want to celebrate this this morning.
[time=2969] What he did in raising Jesus on that third day, he still does.
[time=2973] He's still doing that.
[time=2978] He is still resurrecting lives.
[time=2981] He is still taking people who are broken and beaten, and dead, and bringing new life and new hope to their hearts and lives.
[time=2993] John 11, 25, and 26.
[time=2996] Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection, and the what?
[time=3001] "And the life he who believes in me "will live even if he dies." Verse 26, "And everyone who lives and believes in me, "everyone who lives and embraces the gospel "back to where we began our discussion this morning, "everybody who lives and fully surrenders "their heart and life, takes their arms, "the arms of their soul, and embraces the great truth "that we celebrate today.
[time=3031] "Everyone who says yes to him, "everyone who commits to follow him wholeheartedly, "will never die.
[time=3038] "And I love how Jesus ends the verse.
[time=3042] "He looks at her and says, "What, do you believe this?" And so I humbly stand here before you today, and I ask you,
[time=3052] do you believe this?
[time=3055] Do you know this to be true?
[time=3059] Do you believe that he came God in the form of man?
[time=3065] Do you believe that he lived a perfect life?
[time=3067] Do you believe that because of your sin and mine, he went to the cross to die so our sins could be forgiven?
[time=3072] Do you believe that he was placed in that tomb?
[time=3076] And do you believe that three days later he arose?
[time=3079] If you do, God's word says you will be saved.
[time=3084] And what I want you, what we want you to see this morning in just these closing minutes is this, the resurrection assures us of eternal life then, and makes possible the miracle of changed lives now.
[time=3099] You know, my friends, there is nothing more powerful than the truth of this word, nothing.
[time=3109] It stands alone, it is sufficient, it needs no props, it needs no support, there isn't anything as powerful or as convicting or as inviting as this truth.
[time=3121] Right up there though, right up there, right right below it, in my opinion, is the power and the clarity of a changed,
[time=3130] you've heard me say this before, transformed life.
[time=3134] And we want you this morning on this greatest of all days to just meet some people whose lives have been transformed and changed by the power of the resurrection.
[time=3146] His resurrecting work has been done in their life and in their circumstance, and as you meet them this morning and as you hear or see their stories and you'll hear their stories and see their stories in a rather unique way today.
[time=3160] But as you experience that, our hope and our prayer is that you would make much in your heart of God and his redeeming, resurrecting, transforming work.
[time=3171] Our hope is that many of you in the room who know the Lord will in these next few minutes find great reason to celebrate and rejoice.
[time=3181] Your story may match many of the stories that you'll see here on stage, others of you in the room.
[time=3188] Maybe you're not there yet, maybe you haven't come to that point where you have been willing to surrender and give your heart and life to the one who rose.
[time=3197] Maybe some of what you'll see this morning on stage will encourage you and move you closer to that kind of decision.
[time=3206] God be praised, thank God for what he does as he resurrects people in the everyday of life.
[time=3215] Just watch and listen as Corbin sings and as these people come and be so very encouraged.
[time=3222] [MUSIC - 257 seconds]
[time=3483] And you lived, and you died, and you rose again on high, and you opened the way for the world to live again. Hallelujah.
[time=3502] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're all You turn. Hallelujah. We're all You turn.
[time=3522] Hallelujah. We're all You turn.
[time=3552] Hallelujah.
