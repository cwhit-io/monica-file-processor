[time=735] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=738] Thank you for joining us for a special Sunday called "Glad You Asked." On Easter Sunday, we gave the opportunity for anyone who attended to ask a question that they would like to ask God, and we would search the scriptures for what the Bible addresses on that particular question.
[time=756] So that's what you're going to get to see today.
[time=758] Basically, the questions fall into about five or six categories and we address those in the questions that you'll hear today.
[time=766] And stay tuned for the very special ending as well.
[time=769] I would like to invite you to what I think will be one of the most moving experiences of the year in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=778] It's May 11th, 12th, and 13th.
[time=781] And we're bringing Tommy Walker, one of the most gifted prolific worship leaders and songwriters in Christianity today, coming in with this team of professional musicians.
[time=792] And on Thursday, May 11th and Friday, May 12th, they will be conducting a worship conference for anyone who's on a worship team.
[time=800] It's only $99. It's well worth it.
[time=802] And I highly recommend that you either visit our website, blackhogministries.org, or tommywalker.net, and sign up for the worship conference.
[time=811] It's going to be a rare, intimate time of interaction with just a tremendously anointed worship leader, Tommy Walker.
[time=821] What I want you to do today, however, is to get your tickets for the concert, the worship concert, Friday night, May 12th.
[time=830] It'll start at 7.30 p.m. and run until about 10 p.m.
[time=833] And it is just a special, special time.
[time=836] I was in attendance in Southern California at Saddleback when Tommy produced his live DVD and CD that's out now with 3,000 worship leaders in attendance, concluding a conference in Saddleback.
[time=851] And I'm telling you what I experienced, was not just tremendous impactful new music from Tommy and the team, but a divine encounter.
[time=864] An encounter with God that is difficult to describe.
[time=868] And I want you to experience that.
[time=870] It's just that simple.
[time=871] [MUSIC - 40 seconds]
[time=936] If you could join us Friday, May 12th, 730 to 10 p.m.
[time=939] You can get your tickets, quite possibly, at your local church.
[time=942] We're partnering with a dozen other churches plus Star 88.3 and WBCL 90.3.
[time=949] And you can get tickets also at anchor room or at the two websites, tommywalker.net or blackhuckministries.org.
[time=956] It will be one of the greatest moments of the year in Fort Wayne.
[time=961] So please get your tickets now. I believe we'll sell out and you need to get the tickets right away.
[time=966] So go to anchor room or visit one of the two websites, tommywalker.net or blackhuckministries.org or check your local church.
[time=973] Or if you want us to set them aside for them, you're going to come get them.
[time=977] Just call 4937400 and we'll do that.
[time=980] Following the concert, the next morning, Saturday, from 8 a.m. to noon.
[time=986] We'll meet from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and send everybody out on what we call the big serve.
[time=991] We're partnering with neighborlinkfortwayne.org, N-L-F-W.org.
[time=996] And we're taking people who have the resource and connecting them with people who have a need.
[time=1002] And we're doing serving projects that can be done in basically a two and a half hour window from 9 to about 11.30
[time=1009] or maybe 9.15 to about 11.45. So everyone's done by noon to honor the time.
[time=1014] And you can visit nlfw.org, neighborlinkfortwayne.org and see the postings of needs that are there for people who aren't going to be able to meet the need.
[time=1026] And maybe your small group can come and join us.
[time=1029] We'll have 300 or 400 people at least. That's what we had last time who will go out and meet those needs.
[time=1034] And just visit the website. We'd love for you to join us.
[time=1038] We're showing unity and worship of God at the concert.
[time=1041] But we're showing the community that we care about what goes on in our culture.
[time=1046] And we're meeting the needs of others and serving them in an active worship.
[time=1050] First Peter 4/10 style on Saturday morning May 13.
[time=1053] So get your tickets for the concert now.
[time=1055] Tommy Walker, Friday May 12, 7.30 pm to 10.
[time=1060] Visit the websites, call us, go to anchor room and please feel free to visit the website.
[time=1065] nlfw.org and join us for the big serve.
[time=1069] Thank you so much.
[time=1070] Everyone at Black Hawk Ministries just wants to thank you so much for making the Bible our part of your life.
[time=1075] I'm so thankful that Steve and Mitch are here with me this morning.
[time=1079] As most of you who were here last week, you might remember that we gave people, everybody here, the chance to submit a question.
[time=1087] We said, "You know what? If you have any questions that you want to ask God, we'll do our best to kind of go to the Scriptures throughout the week and come back this Sunday today and interact with you on those topics."
[time=1100] And so we were so grateful for the many, many questions that got submitted.
[time=1105] We are so thankful for your willingness to submit them and thankful for the chance this morning to just kind of make our way through and see what God's Word has to say about these things.
[time=1115] Very real life stuff that got turned in.
[time=1118] And I want to say this to you. Some in the room, you might be very new to the journey.
[time=1124] A relationship with the Lord or an involvement or a participation in a local church like this.
[time=1131] This might be very, very new ground for you. Some of the questions that you'll hear this morning.
[time=1136] You may never have thought of them, let alone ever heard an answer to them.
[time=1141] Others of you in the room, you've been around for a while and we want to just encourage you.
[time=1145] We think this is a valuable time for you to continue to be refreshed and renewed in your understanding
[time=1151] of not only what certain people are thinking and questions that folks have today but the way in which we can interact with them
[time=1158] and interface with them in a loving and respectful and we believe truthful manner.
[time=1163] And so I hope everybody can just get out of pen, take some notes and enjoy what we've entitled "Glad You Asked" and we are.
[time=1171] First question. What we did was this. All the questions came in, there were a bunch.
[time=1176] And then we just kind of put the questions in groups and we tried to really honor the spirit of the question.
[time=1182] We didn't get to all of them. If your question doesn't get addressed, you can come and we can talk about that.
[time=1188] We'd be happy to. We tried to come up with about ten, eleven or so questions that we felt like.
[time=1193] Represented the spirit of what was being asked last week so I hope it's encouraging to you.
[time=1199] Number one question. We heard this a lot from the little kids. Where did God come from?
[time=1205] What a great question. Where did God come from and when? When did God begin?
[time=1211] And so we're going to turn that one over to Steven.
[time=1216] I still ponder that. I hope I'm pondering that when I'm eighty-five.
[time=1224] Actually, I hope when I'm eighty-five I'm with him and I don't have to ponder it anymore.
[time=1230] Let's look at Genesis 1-1 and contemplate that question in a minute.
[time=1235] In the beginning, God. Well, the beginning of what?
[time=1241] It's not His beginning. It's the beginning of time. It's the beginning of all created things.
[time=1250] God is and He is in terms that we think about in the past. His name is I Am.
[time=1259] He is present tense all the time and everything that preceded time and everything that follows time.
[time=1269] He's the same yesterday, today and forever. He is I Am. He is all the time.
[time=1278] And I love the fact that I can't get that. I'm in time and I think in terms of past, present and future time.
[time=1288] It's hard for me to get outside that, but He is outside that.
[time=1292] And when I ponder that, it causes me to think about the fact that He's totally other than us.
[time=1299] That's why I'm never going to totally get that.
[time=1302] And I don't even understand Him being I Am all the time, but He is. And I love it.
[time=1310] Amen. Anything to that? Good. That's good.
[time=1314] Number two, we hear this a lot. We hear it in counseling sessions.
[time=1319] We hear it in the day-to-day conversations. We hear it from you, and you know what?
[time=1324] Sometimes you'll hear it from us. This is a question I think that everybody asks.
[time=1329] There are times when we ask it in a kind of an original sense, like what is, we just kind of first start thinking about it, but you know what?
[time=1336] We think about it even as life goes on. What is the purpose for my life?
[time=1341] What is it that I'm supposed to do? Who is it that I'm supposed to be fundamentally?
[time=1347] Whether you're in the marketplace or whether you're in ministry or whether you're at home, whether you're in school.
[time=1352] What is the purpose for my life? And I'm so thankful that the Scriptures speak to this very thing.
[time=1359] Why don't you guys take that one? Well, Micah 6/8 is one of my favorite passages.
[time=1364] We chose three passages of Scripture to kind of define this.
[time=1368] And then he asks, it says, "He has told you, O man, what is good?
[time=1372] And what does the Lord require of you, but to do justice, do catch that word?
[time=1377] To love kindness, love, and to walk humbly with your God." I even preached on this one time.
[time=1384] And in order to do justice while loving kindness, we have to walk humbly with God.
[time=1394] It's not possible to be doing one thing while loving another.
[time=1400] And understanding when to exercise those, unless by the discerning power of the Holy Spirit,
[time=1406] you're walking humbly with Him.
[time=1408] My purpose in life, first of all, spelled out with me being in a really humble relationship,
[time=1414] utterly dependent on the living God, looking for the purpose and answers in life from Him.
[time=1422] And walk humbly, walk is a metaphor throughout the Bible for life.
[time=1427] My life is this humble heart.
[time=1430] It's totally surrendered to the potter, God.
[time=1434] Solomon said it this way, and Ecclesiastes 12, verses 13 and 14, pondering these kinds of thoughts.
[time=1440] He says, "Well, the conclusion when all has been heard is, hear God, humble yourself to God, and keep His commandments to do justice,
[time=1449] because this applies to every person.
[time=1453] For God will bring every act into judgment that's a sobering thought.
[time=1456] Everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil, so therefore walk humbly with your God.
[time=1463] The purpose really is a heart condition.
[time=1466] It's a heart condition, and mind and heart are used interchangeably in Scriptures, and Romans 12, 1 and 2 says this as well.
[time=1474] Wanna be want to take that?
[time=1476] Absolutely. Romans 12, 1 says, "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God,
[time=1486] which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=1489] So we're offering Him everything, all of us." And then here's 12, too.
[time=1494] We talked about this actually.
[time=1495] We spent eight to nine weeks talking about and teaching on a transformed life.
[time=1500] And here's where we find that.
[time=1502] Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed.
[time=1506] There's the purpose right there.
[time=1508] Be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what the will of God is,
[time=1515] that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=1519] Yeah, you can test it.
[time=1521] You can prove it.
[time=1523] You don't have to know the purpose.
[time=1525] You can test things out, and then if there's agreement in your spirit, you can continue in that and enjoy that.
[time=1532] Well, friend of mine came up to me after first service, he said, and don't leave out the fact that in 1 Corinthians 12, we're all members of the body, individuals in the body, who collectively get to experience purpose here in our body together, and in every single arena of our lives, all week long, whatever arena we're in, we have purpose there as ministers of the gospel.
[time=1553] We tend to taint the question, what is the purpose for my life with a Western culture perspective that I got to figure out now, I'm going to be fulfilled.
[time=1562] I'm going to find my purpose in life by some career, some goal, some spouse.
[time=1568] You think purpose is activity.
[time=1570] Activity or accomplishing goals.
[time=1572] Whereas it's really a heart condition, and then all those things flow out of that rather than the opposite.
[time=1578] I think that's really important.
[time=1582] I would just sum it up this way.
[time=1584] Passion is more important than purpose.
[time=1587] Well said.
[time=1589] How can I, we hear this so many times, and we experience this.
[time=1595] I'll be honest with you.
[time=1596] This isn't just something we hear from you.
[time=1598] These are things that we as men struggle with and wrestle with at times.
[time=1603] How can we overcome the anxiety, fear, and depression that seem to hold us captive?
[time=1613] This is the everyday real stuff of life, my friends.
[time=1618] And what a great question, and what a great opportunity for us as individuals and as a family to see what God's word has to say about our response or our approach to these struggles.
[time=1630] Mitchell, why don't you take that one.
[time=1632] Well anxiety is a divided mind, a divided inner being.
[time=1637] It's a soul that's out of alignment.
[time=1640] Your soul is your mind, will, and emotions.
[time=1642] Most of those would agree your mind, your will, and emotions.
[time=1645] And it kind of looks like this.
[time=1646] Let's just say that Kelly represents emotions, and our emotions are stuck in the past
[time=1652] because we were hurt, so they're stuck in past hurts.
[time=1656] I'm going to represent the will that I'm sitting here in the present and my will is frustrated because my expectations have not been met.
[time=1666] And then my mind, it's always focused on the future and afraid of what's to come.
[time=1675] My emotions in the past, in past hurts, my will here in the present frustrated because of unmet expectations and my mind in the future afraid of what's going to come next.
[time=1685] How many people can identify with a soul that can be like that?
[time=1689] Yeah, see that's kind of the way we do it.
[time=1691] But we have the spirit that connects with the spirit of Christ that can bring us to the presence of God,
[time=1699] and we live in the present free from anxiety in peace in a real way Christ aligns the soul.
[time=1707] Okay, let's look how Paul said it in Philippians 4.
[time=1711] This is usually where I want people to go when they are challenged with this kind of a thing.
[time=1717] And to read Philippians 4, Philippians are all about joy.
[time=1720] Philippians 4 says rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1723] Again, I will say rejoice.
[time=1725] Let your gentle spirit be known to all men.
[time=1729] The Lord is here.
[time=1733] I am anxious for nothing.
[time=1736] Nothing.
[time=1737] Do the divided soul for nothing.
[time=1739] But in everything, by prayer, which is my heart being shaped and molded like God's heart,
[time=1746] and supplication, those are the requests that we toss up there, the thing we would really call prayer typically.
[time=1752] With thanksgiving, big, big concept there, with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God.
[time=1759] God, I am thankful in these circumstances, maybe not formed but in them.
[time=1763] And then the peace of God, the opposite of the anxiety, the soul that is out of alignment, the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts like a military fortress in your mind in Christ Jesus.
[time=1775] Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute.
[time=1783] If there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise dwell on these things, I had a time in my life where I felt this anxiety, extremely powerful anxiety.
[time=1792] And it was just kind of like what I described you, that's what I've tried to use to connect it to other people.
[time=1798] And I memorize this list and I tried to just dwell on those things.
[time=1803] And when I taught on a series in common ground on Philippians, it was a maze to find out that if you go through there, each one of those characteristics in Philippians 4.8, they represent a characteristic of the heart of Christ.
[time=1815] And then if you look at the opposite, each one represents a characteristic of Satan.
[time=1820] Amazing. The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things and the God of peace will be with you.
[time=1828] But I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last you have received your concern for me.
[time=1833] Indeed, you are concerned before, but you lacked opportunity.
[time=1837] Not that I speak from want or have learned to be content, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances
[time=1844] I am. Wow. So it's not the circumstances.
[time=1848] I know how to get along with humble means and I also know how to live in prosperity.
[time=1852] In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance
[time=1860] and suffering need, I can do all things through Christ.
[time=1865] It strengthens me by aligning my soul with his.
[time=1870] And that's where I experience a peace that passes all human understanding.
[time=1874] Wow. When I really know forgiveness of the past, when I've really experienced and I feel forgiven, and when I forgive, and when I really place my hope in Christ and the future, the anxiety disappears in the present.
[time=1889] That's so good. And you know what?
[time=1892] I think we're receiving a lot of teaching from false teachers today.
[time=1896] People that tell you that there won't be anxious moments.
[time=1900] And there won't be bad times in your life when you will experience fear.
[time=1905] And that somehow the Old Testament conditional promises that were for a time and place for a period are somehow yours all the time in Christ.
[time=1914] That you don't have to experience anything bad in life.
[time=1917] The New Testament does not teach that.
[time=1919] As a matter of fact, it teaches us that we are to consider those joyful times,
[time=1927] even when they're not.
[time=1929] I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.
[time=1932] That's not about me making more money.
[time=1934] That's not about me getting to do the things I want to do.
[time=1936] That's about me understanding the secret of contentment, no matter what the circumstances.
[time=1942] And I think it's just worth noting here from what these guys just said.
[time=1946] And I hope everybody in the room just don't miss this.
[time=1951] If you don't know him, I mean really.
[time=1956] What Mitch just read you there in Philippians 4, if you're not in Christ,
[time=1963] you're just not going to have peace.
[time=1967] Then you will be gripped by.
[time=1969] Your life will be known.
[time=1971] That will be your experience.
[time=1974] First of all, you have to know him.
[time=1976] Then having come to know him, then as you read through that passage in Philippians 4, you realize there are some things that you can give yourself to.
[time=1983] There are some disciplines of the heart and mind that you and I can pursue that he really uses to bring again and again that peace, which surpasses all understanding.
[time=1992] So just make sure you give some thought to that.
[time=1995] Very similar.
[time=1996] And this is a question that we get oftentimes.
[time=1999] And you know what?
[time=2000] I'm not tired of it.
[time=2001] I know it's out there.
[time=2002] I know people feel it.
[time=2003] I know you think it.
[time=2004] It's good to get it out.
[time=2005] And we're going to do our best just to address it again this morning.
[time=2008] Why do you, God, as a good and loving God, we saw, if we saw one, we saw 35 of these.
[time=2016] Why do you, as a good and loving God, allow the evil, painful, heartbreaking things that
[time=2023] happen to take place?
[time=2025] And as we read through the cards, I mean, as I looked at them, you could, some of the folks, you know, they wrote out some of those things.
[time=2033] And we're talking about the, you know, the horrific stuff of life and people wondering,
[time=2040] how can a good and loving God allow the horrific stuff of life to take place?
[time=2046] And I'm going to let Steve start us out.
[time=2048] A lot of times in my experience, we were singing this morning, "Your grace is enough.
[time=2053] Your grace is enough." I've got to tell you the truth.
[time=2056] There have been a lot of times in my life when I said right now, God, it doesn't feel like enough.
[time=2060] The truth of it is, right now, in the middle of these circumstances, these times, it doesn't
[time=2066] even come close to feeling like enough.
[time=2069] It is enough.
[time=2070] I believe that with all my heart because he's revealed it is true.
[time=2073] But it doesn't feel like it during a lot of life.
[time=2077] And to be honest about it, I need to say, I don't get it.
[time=2081] I wish you hadn't.
[time=2082] But I also know that he did not want us to be puppets.
[time=2087] And he chose to give us opportunity for relationship with him.
[time=2092] And he chose to give us opportunity to reject it.
[time=2097] And evil came out of the rejection.
[time=2100] And it's a reality in our lives.
[time=2103] Now, truthfully, his grace is enough, but it doesn't feel like it a lot of the time.
[time=2110] That's why I have to renew my mind constantly.
[time=2115] And I have to experience worship.
[time=2119] And I need to be obedient.
[time=2121] And out of that comes the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=2124] Love, joy, and peace, patience, kindness, and goodness, faithfulness, and gentleness, and
[time=2130] self-control.
[time=2131] Then I feel differently as well.
[time=2135] We ought to look at John 1633.
[time=2139] He says, "These things have I spoken to you so that in me, you may have peace.
[time=2144] In the world you have tribulation, troubles.
[time=2148] But take courage, I've overcome the world." I think when I read John 1633 it reminds me that oftentimes, and I don't know quite, I don't know who to blame for this one, I don't know who's at fault, but there's just this expectation.
[time=2161] We just have to bearing degrees.
[time=2163] I think I hear it and I see it in me at times.
[time=2166] I hear it and see it in you.
[time=2167] There's this expectation that somehow in this world we will have peace.
[time=2171] But that's not what the verse says.
[time=2174] It says, "In him you will have what?
[time=2176] Peace.
[time=2177] In this world you will have what?" Relation.
[time=2180] Trouble.
[time=2181] Pain.
[time=2182] Horrific stuff.
[time=2184] Stuff that I don't think he likes.
[time=2187] I hate the picture.
[time=2188] I hear some people paint of God.
[time=2191] I understand that he allows.
[time=2193] And in his allowing, I understand you could say he causes.
[time=2196] And in his sovereignty and great providence, you know, I'm okay with that.
[time=2200] And I know that the events of this life in comparison to what we're going to experience are absolutely nothing.
[time=2206] We get caught up in the time thing and this place thing, he's so far beyond that and someday we'll get that.
[time=2212] What bothers me is that on the sovereignty front, I hate it when I hear folks painting a picture of God that makes it sound like he likes it.
[time=2222] Like he caused it and he wanted it, you know.
[time=2225] He wanted the molestation.
[time=2227] He wanted, I don't think God is honored, pleased or wanted any of that stuff.
[time=2232] What he allows, yes he allows.
[time=2234] And in the midst of that he provides you and I a way through it.
[time=2237] But I believe the sinful, broken stuff of this world that takes place, I believe it breaks God's heart.
[time=2244] And that he allows it or causes it.
[time=2248] Doesn't mean somehow he's for it or pleased by it, but in the midst of that he gives us a way of moving through those things.
[time=2256] To a place of hope and healing and life.
[time=2260] And I think it's a question that you and I have to keep wrestling with.
[time=2264] He is loving, he is good and when difficult horrific things happen, it doesn't mean he's not loving and good.
[time=2271] It means there's opportunities we may not understand until that day when we see him and are with him face to face.
[time=2278] And in your sufferings he will shape you to be more like Christ, have the heart of Christ from his 828-29.
[time=2285] He'll work it together for good.
[time=2287] He will in spite of the mess.
[time=2290] He will shape your heart to be like Christ.
[time=2292] And here's why I think that's the case.
[time=2295] It's because God will use you then to minister to others who have similar trials and struggles.
[time=2304] I really think that that's his way.
[time=2308] And man we need that, we need that.
[time=2311] And if you're in something right now, man go to Christ, get wise counsel.
[time=2316] Have him mold and shape your heart like his so that you can go minister to someone else with that same problem.
[time=2324] Because God will accuse you to do that.
[time=2326] First Corinthians says you can comfort others with the comfort with which you have been comforted when you get it from him.
[time=2336] Next question, another great question somebody wrote in is the Bible truly accurate?
[time=2342] Is it reliable and applicable to the everyday of my life?
[time=2347] Is the Bible really true?
[time=2348] And I'm going to have Mitchell give you a couple verses and talk to you just briefly about them.
[time=2352] Then I'm going to have Steve tell you what he told Mitchell and I in the office this last week when we were talking about this question.
[time=2360] Well is the Bible truly accurate, reliable and applicable to the everyday of my life?
[time=2364] Yes, I've tried lots of books.
[time=2369] I've tried lots of ways.
[time=2372] Nothing, nothing.
[time=2375] No degree, no commentary, no smart guys book, no science thing, no whatever that.
[time=2381] Has come close to being relevant to every part of my life than the Bible, nothing.
[time=2388] It pales, everything else pales in comparison from my own personal experience.
[time=2394] My business changed, my family changed, my relationships changed when I allowed God to use this again in my life.
[time=2400] And now I have this thirst for it.
[time=2401] And here's what the Bible says about itself.
[time=2403] 2 Timothy 3 16 and 17, all scripture is inspired by God, God breathed.
[time=2409] And profitable for teaching or reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness.
[time=2416] What's right in God's sight?
[time=2418] So that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.
[time=2425] And then it goes on to say in Hebrews 4 verse 12, "For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit,
[time=2437] of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
[time=2445] And I just want to tell you, that's why I think when the Bible's taught, people surrender their lives to Christ.
[time=2451] That's why I think when the Bible is taught that the Holy Spirit works and shapes and molds hearts to be like His.
[time=2457] And it's a powerful, powerful tool of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2462] What'd you say Spurgeon said about the Bible for sure?
[time=2465] Charles Spurgeon said the Bible sheds a lot of light on commentaries.
[time=2473] That includes sermons, you know.
[time=2475] Sermons are commentaries, make sure you check your Bible.
[time=2480] One of the things that bugged me when I was, I'd say about 23, was that everybody kept telling me that the Bible was true and accurate,
[time=2491] and all the things that are listed there.
[time=2494] But they'd use Bible verses to talk about itself.
[time=2501] That bothered me.
[time=2503] And so I kind of fought that.
[time=2506] And then I started to notice the changes in the people's lives who believe the Bible to be true and applied the truth in the Bible to their lives.
[time=2519] And you know what? I'm here to tell you, I've never seen anybody that applied the truth of the Bible in their choice making that weren't pleased about the results of that.
[time=2532] The people are changed by the power of the Word of God, and it's evidence of the accuracy and truth of the Word of God.
[time=2539] We saw that happen last week, and we saw people walk out here with the card.
[time=2543] If you turn around up here, you see back there, we hung all those cards up here.
[time=2548] People changed lives by the power of God, and He uses His Word to transform people, to renew them.
[time=2557] And that's evidence of the power and validity of the Bible.
[time=2562] Absolutely.
[time=2564] Everybody, just look at those cards real quick. Just turn around. If you're in the balcony, don't try, you'll fall.
[time=2569] Everybody just look real quick at those cards, and just remember how Steve just said that.
[time=2575] What you see there is validation of the resurrection power of God and the unbelievable life-changing power of the Scripture.
[time=2582] Why don't we just thank God again for what happened last Sunday.
[time=2586] [AMEN] We're going to just keep going.
[time=2595] This is a big one. We could go all weeks on this one, but I want to just say a couple of things.
[time=2600] Somebody writes down, Ephesians 1, is predestination really true.
[time=2604] Are people really elected or chosen by God before time ever began?
[time=2611] As you read other cards that were submitted along these lines, you could hear the tension.
[time=2617] You could read, and we see it again and again.
[time=2619] People thinking that on the one hand, they kind of thought they had a choice in the matter, that they had made a decision to fully surrender their hearts and lives to Christ.
[time=2629] They're folks whose cards indicated a tension.
[time=2632] They thought they had a choice, but then they read in the Bible that maybe it all got determined before time began.
[time=2638] Let's look at what that says, Ephesians 1, verses 4 to 6.
[time=2644] Just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, way back before it all began, it says he chose you, that we would be holy and blameless before him.
[time=2660] In love, verse 5, he predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the kind intention of his will,
[time=2672] to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved.
[time=2678] Again, there's so much there that we have in the past, and I'm sure we will again in the future dive into.
[time=2685] I want you just to hear me, I want you to hear us say this.
[time=2687] We believe wholeheartedly.
[time=2689] And again, what Steve said earlier about how he loves that his God kind of transcends human understanding.
[time=2696] I would say the same thing here because I fully and absolutely believe in the doctrine of election.
[time=2703] I fully believe, and I am comfortable with the scriptures teaching on the fact that before time began, God knew me, and God chose me.
[time=2714] And God, September of 1983 in the back row of that church listening to Romans 7, called me, I believe that, that he chose me.
[time=2724] And that he drew me to himself, I believe that with my whole heart.
[time=2728] I believe with my whole heart that that night in September of 1983, I made a decision to fully surrender my heart.
[time=2740] I believe I made a choice there to repent.
[time=2743] I believe that in that moment I was able to exercise the same thing that God gave Adam and Eve in the garden.
[time=2749] In the garden, choice. Did God know what they? Yes.
[time=2754] And I don't understand how it all ties together.
[time=2757] And there are some people who want to always kind of help me with that.
[time=2760] And I kind of say, you know what, I just don't want to know.
[time=2763] And maybe it's because I'm not that smart and I don't want to tax my mind.
[time=2767] But I just am okay with the fact that I don't get it completely.
[time=2772] But I do know he chose me and I do know that John 3 16 says that those who believe, that those who choose, that those who submit, that those who believe will have everlasting life.
[time=2788] It says that God so loved the world that he gave his only son.
[time=2793] It says that God so loved the world. It doesn't say God so loved the elect. It said God so loved the world.
[time=2800] And people get this. So I don't understand how it all fits together.
[time=2804] But I fully agree with the fact. The question was predestination. I agree.
[time=2811] Next question.
[time=2813] How can I become a stronger person so that I can go to heaven with my children?
[time=2820] Isn't that interesting?
[time=2822] Awareness that the children have a faith.
[time=2826] He says, "If you'll come to him like them, not in your strength."
[time=2832] He says, "If you come to me as a little child, weak, you come to me and then I'll live out my strength in you.
[time=2842] And I will save you by my strength. It's by the blood of Jesus Christ, the power of his resurrection that we're saved.
[time=2852] And we can't be strong enough. We can't do anything to get there."
[time=2858] Let's look at one passage of Scripture. 2 Corinthians 12 says, "And he has said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you.'
[time=2869] For power is perfected in weakness. His power, when I'm weak and I'm not doing things on my own on my terms,
[time=2878] he is living in me. His power is perfected when I know I can't do it on my own.'"
[time=2886] Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, Paul says,
[time=2892] so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
[time=2895] Therefore, I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake.
[time=2904] For when I am weak, then I am strong. Do you know the reality of your inability to please him on your own?
[time=2915] Do you know the reality of your inability to be perfect?
[time=2920] When you recognize the size of the beam in your eye, then in his strength he takes it out.
[time=2929] Do you go to heaven? All you really have to know is that you don't deserve it on your own merit
[time=2937] and that you're trusting in the fact that he chose a way through the blood of Christ
[time=2943] for me to get to be in relationship with him forever in heaven.
[time=2948] By his strength, I'm saved when I really understand my weakness and my need.
[time=2956] One of the things I'm so thankful for about all of you, and I think Mitchell would say this and Steve would say this, I believe that you as a family have over the years, and I see it often.
[time=2966] I believe you have as a family, and I think God's done it through you.
[time=2970] We have an environment here where people who are on this journey,
[time=2978] people who have a messy life, they don't have it all together, they have a lot of questions,
[time=2984] they have a lot of struggles, you have created an environment where they feel like they can come and ask their questions and go through their process.
[time=2994] They don't feel like coming in here, they have to be somebody who's got it all figured out and all the eyes dotted, all the teas crossed, and I'm so grateful for that.
[time=3004] I think it's so healthy, and I'm so grateful for your willingness to travel that road, and I'm so grateful for the freedom that you extend to others in that very same situation.
[time=3015] Somebody wrote in about sin, they wanted to know how many times they could be forgiven.
[time=3020] Maybe you thought this to yourself, maybe you thought, "My goodness, I cannot ask forgiveness for this thing again."
[time=3028] How many times can I be forgiven?
[time=3031] Mitchell?
[time=3032] A lot. First John 1-9, "If we confess our sins, big qualifier, if I agree with God,
[time=3039] what I've done is desired life apart from Him in whatever the circumstances.
[time=3043] He is faithful and righteous to forgive, to forgive us our sins,
[time=3049] and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, not just forgive us from the penalty, but to actually restore us and free us from the power of sin." Peter walked up to Jesus and said, "So this is this vertical forgiveness deal that I received from God, but what we really struggle is horizontally in issuing that and asking for that from others."
[time=3068] So Peter walked up to Jesus and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? How about seven times?" Jesus said to Him, "I did not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."
[time=3082] So 490 times. There you go. No. It's hyperbole.
[time=3088] Anybody over 490 yet? Oh, yes. Sold.
[time=3093] So Jesus is saying, He didn't tell us a story.
[time=3098] You've been forgiven the biggest debt that man could even think of.
[time=3101] He uses a number that's bigger than they've ever heard before.
[time=3104] He says, "You've been forgiven that by God.
[time=3106] Therefore, if you are forgiven, and because you are forgiven actually, you will go live out and radically issue forgiveness to others, and that will draw people to Christ." It's the hallmark of Christianity that I receive this forgiveness, and therefore I release it liberally to others.
[time=3125] I just let go, and I also go seek it when I need it, but it's because of this huge debt that I'll forgive these little bitty-bitty debts as the way Jesus tells the story.
[time=3135] I found that when I don't want to forgive horizontally, it's kind of been this detachment on how big the debt was that I had forgiven me.
[time=3144] And all I need to do is be reminded, Galatians 6-1, that I could commit that same sin that's going on here, and that it's easy to let go.
[time=3154] That's good. Why don't you guys take this last one?
[time=3156] Steve, why don't you read it? We love it when we get questions like this.
[time=3160] This was great to read.
[time=3162] How can I have and experience this life-changing relationship with God that you guys are always talking about?
[time=3169] I'll tell you something. We don't just talk about it.
[time=3171] With the other guys that were up here on this stage, we get to enjoy the reality of what life together after life change really means.
[time=3180] And I love these two men.
[time=3182] I like them too, which is really fun.
[time=3185] And life change took place because we came to Christ,
[time=3191] and He changed us so that we can live together.
[time=3195] How can you experience life-changing relationship?
[time=3198] Come to Jesus Christ and let Him change you, John 3-16.
[time=3203] For God so loved.
[time=3206] One theologian says the most important word there is so.
[time=3209] For God so loved the world.
[time=3212] He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him fully surrenders His life, help seekers find and follow Christ, a fully surrounded community of Christ followers, whoever believes, whoever believes, it's this commitment of my entire inner being is not mere mental ascent, whoever believes in Him.
[time=3229] So not perish, but have eternal life.
[time=3236] There was a common thread in everything that we said here today, and it's Christ.
[time=3242] See, we don't call you, and nor does God call us to religion, because religion justifies myself, and that's really what we're doing.
[time=3248] When we're out there outside of Christ, trying to maintain control of our own lives, and God's not going to fit in some religious formula.
[time=3254] If I do this, then God, you will do that.
[time=3256] He does it.
[time=3257] It's a relationship, and it's unique for each individual.
[time=3260] And the common thread here is Christ.
[time=3262] In fact, you got to realize what this is for.
[time=3265] In John 5-39 and 40, Jesus told people who wanted it to be all about religion that you can search through the Scriptures, and you think that in them you'll find eternal life, but they testify to me.
[time=3276] Come to me, a person of God, Jesus Christ, and you will find eternal life.
[time=3280] So wherever you go, this week, I want you to come back to Christ taking control of your life, to let go of that steering wheel of your life and give it to Jesus Christ.
[time=3296] And every single thing that happens to you, say, "I can't, you can." Jesus, amen.
[time=3302] Some people have him in the trunk, some people have him in the back seat, but some people, he's a passenger on the front seat.
[time=3311] But people who trust in Christ and are fully committed to him, give him the steering wheel, and they slide over.
[time=3317] That's what Christ needs to do.
[time=3319] Which brings us, here we go, which brings us to our last question.
[time=3323] Hold on the last question.
[time=3325] I just got to say this to you.
[time=3326] Before you see the last question, I got to say this to you.
[time=3328] I'm always talking about Eric and Beth and Lauren and Ed and Corbin,
[time=3334] you know, our programming team.
[time=3335] I'm always talking about how much I appreciate their diversity, their willingness to do different things different ways.
[time=3341] I know it speaks to a number of different people.
[time=3343] Well, we got a question in the mix this last week, and we just thought it was kind of fun, but it's also, you know, it works.
[time=3352] Here it is.
[time=3353] Here's the -- Corbin, come on up.
[time=3355] Corbin, why don't you ever do any country music on a Sunday morning?
[time=3361] So you got to understand Corbin, you know.
[time=3364] Corbin really doesn't care for country music.
[time=3368] And as far as connecting country with worship, you may -- it might be a little bit of a stretch.
[time=3374] But you also got to know this about Corbin.
[time=3376] He's very -- he's very motivated.
[time=3378] And I think he felt a little challenged by the question.
[time=3382] And so we're going to end today, and I just want you to be encouraged.
[time=3386] We're kind of having fun with this, but you know what?
[time=3388] It's also very, very serious.
[time=3390] There's a song out in the country world that's actually crossed over into all kinds of stations by a gal named Kerry.
[time=3397] And we have our own Kerry, who's joined us.
[time=3400] And so Corbin says, "Okay, I'll give them country." So why don't you all just stand quietly?
[time=3407] Go ahead and stand.
[time=3408] And we'll just do a verse in a chorus and have fun with it, but you know what?
[time=3413] Be encouraged as well.
[time=3414] What Stephen Mitch just said about the wheel is really, really important.
[time=3419] Listen.
[time=3427] She was driving late Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas scene.
[time=3435] Going home to see her mom and her daddy with a berry in the backseat.
[time=3441] Fifty miles to go when she was running low on faith in gasoline.
[time=3448] It'd been a long hard year.
[time=3451] She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention.
[time=3455] She was going way too fast.
[time=3459] And before she knew what she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass.
[time=3465] She saw both her lives flash before her eyes.
[time=3469] She didn't even have time to cry.
[time=3472] She was so scared.
[time=3475] She threw her hands up in the air.
[time=3481] Jesus, take the wheel.
[time=3485] Take it from my hands because I can't do this on my own.
[time=3493] I'm letting go.
[time=3496] So give me one more chance to save me from this road I'm on.
[time=3505] Jesus, take the wheel.
[time=3535] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=3587] Okay, I had the opportunity to jump into a ministry that I felt had a great need, a great possibility for vision.
[time=3596] Okay, that's good.
[time=3604] You know, I wake up every morning and I spend about ten minutes just gazing on it, pondering it at night before I go to bed.
[time=3611] It's the last thing I look at.
[time=3613] What do you find to be the most beautiful characteristic of --
