[time=260] I would like to invite you to what I think will be one of the most moving experiences of the year in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=271] It's May 11th, 12th, and 13th, and we're bringing Tommy Walker, one of the most gifted prolific worship leaders and songwriters in Christianity today, coming in with his team of professional musicians.
[time=285] And on Thursday, May 11th and Friday, May 12th, they will be conducting a worship conference for anyone who's on a worship team.
[time=293] It's only $99, it's well worth it, and I highly recommend that you either visit our website, blackhawkministries.org, or tommywalker.net, and sign up for the worship conference.
[time=304] It's going to be a rare, intimate time of interaction with just a tremendously anointed worship leader, Tommy Walker.
[time=314] What I want you to do today, however, is to get your tickets for the concert, the worship concert, Friday night, May 12th.
[time=323] It'll start at 7.30 p.m. and run till about 10 p.m. and it is just a special, special time.
[time=329] I was in attendance in Southern California at Saddleback when Tommy produced his live DVD and CD that's out now with 3,000 worship leaders in attendance, concluding a conference in Saddleback.
[time=343] And I'm telling you what I experienced was not just tremendous impactful new music from Tommy and the team, but a divine encounter, an encounter with God that is difficult to describe.
[time=361] And I want you to experience us just that simple.
[time=391] Shouting, creation, song, all the saints join in.
[time=421] If you could join us Friday, May 12th, 7.30 to 10 p.m. you can get your tickets quite possibly at your local church.
[time=435] We're partnering with a dozen other churches plus Star 88.3 and WBCL 90.3 and you can get tickets also at anchor room or at the two websites, tommywalker.net or blackhuckministries.org.
[time=449] It will be one of the greatest moments of the year in Fort Wayne. So please get your tickets now. I believe we'll sell out and you need to get the tickets right away.
[time=459] So go to anchor room or visit one of the two websites, tommywalker.net or blackhuckministries.org or check your local church.
[time=466] Or if you just, if you want us to set them aside for and you're going to come get them, just call 4937400 and we'll do that.
[time=473] Following the concert, the next morning, Saturday from 8 a.m. to noon, we'll meet from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and send everybody out on what we call the big serve.
[time=484] We're partnering with neighborlinkfortwayne.org, N-L-F-W.org, and we're taking people who have the resource and connecting them with people who have a need.
[time=495] And we're doing serving projects that can be done in basically a two and a half hour window from 9 to about 11 30, or maybe 9 15 to about 11 45.
[time=504] So everyone's done by noon to honor the time. And you can visit nlfw.org, neighborlinkfortwayne.org, and see the postings of needs that are there for people who aren't going to be able to meet the need.
[time=518] And maybe your small group can come and join us. We'll have three or 400 people at least. That's what we had last time, who will go out and meet those needs.
[time=526] And just visit the website. We'd love for you to join us. We're showing unity and worship of God at the concert.
[time=534] But we're showing the community that we care about what goes on in our culture, and we're meeting the needs of others and serving them in an active worship.
[time=542] First Peter 410 style on Saturday morning, May 13. So get your tickets for the concert now. Tommy Walker, Friday, May 12, 730pm to 10.
[time=552] Visit the websites, call us, go to anchor room, and please feel free to visit the website nlfw.org and join us for the big surf.
[time=561] Thank you so much. Everyone at Black Hawk Ministries just wants to thank you so much for making the Bible our part of your life.
[time=568] Welcome back to a series that we began weeks ago. We had a great Easter break, and now we're back to our study of the book of...
[time=578] Anybody remember? Joshua. Good job. We began several weeks ago. And in our study of Joshua, it didn't take long until we came to a story there in chapter 2.
[time=588] I believe Steve Longbreak was here that morning. And it was the story of a gal named Rahab.
[time=594] And Rahab, as most of you might remember, others of you who are new, she is a gal who...
[time=600] We kind of see her story unfold in chapter 2 there, Joshua, but we hear about her even later in the New Testament.
[time=607] She is referred to as one who had exercised great faith.
[time=611] She is a great example for you and I, of one who was willing to respond to the promises that God made.
[time=618] And she puts herself in quite a situation in her willingness, with her willingness to follow and trust him.
[time=626] Our drama team has kind of put their own spin on this. It is a great look into this woman's life, the choice that she made, and the effects that God brought because of that choice.
[time=638] And it's something that's tied to our message today as we continue to look at this life of faith in the book of Joshua.
[time=647] And then you pull the fibers out like this.
[time=650] Oh, yep, I think I've got it. See, Ray, I told you she was a fast learner.
[time=655] Now, tell us the story about how you married Solomon.
[time=657] Oh, yes, tell us. And about Jericho too. Marta tells me you have quite a story.
[time=664] In order to do that, I'm going to have to give you a little background on my previous occupation.
[time=670] Oh, I already told her all about that.
[time=672] I mean, I had reservations about working for Rahab the harlot, but once I met you...
[time=678] Let's just say that she saw past your past. Go ahead, tell us the story.
[time=682] Yeah, go ahead.
[time=683] Okay, well, I had already decided to leave my prior occupation.
[time=689] You see, I felt the presence of a God I didn't understand. The God of the Israelites.
[time=695] I had heard of the great things he had accomplished, and I wanted to know him.
[time=700] But I knew in my heart of hearts that my lifestyle would not be pleasing to a God such as he.
[time=705] That's when I decided to do something entirely different with my life.
[time=709] I had already accumulated enough materials to start a textile business.
[time=713] Things weren't easy at first, as I was known throughout Jericho as...
[time=718] Well, you know. Yeah, things were really rough.
[time=722] But one day, two strangers came to my door.
[time=726] I figured they were looking for something I no longer provided.
[time=730] But...
[time=732] Hello? Is anybody home?
[time=742] Solomon, let's just get out of here. Those guards are right behind us, and we gotta find somewhere else to hide.
[time=749] No, this is the place. We must stop here.
[time=753] Hello?
[time=762] I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I believe you can find what you're looking for up the road.
[time=766] There's a home with purple silk curtains.
[time=768] No, no, you don't understand. We need somewhere to hide, like, right now.
[time=773] Hide? No.
[time=775] I mean, I used to be an innkeeper, but I don't do that anymore.
[time=782] What? What's your name?
[time=785] Rahab.
[time=786] Look, Rahab, we have two guards that are trying to capture us.
[time=792] The Lord has brought us to your door. I don't know what you're talking about, but we would just want you to take us in and please hide us. That's all.
[time=800] Okay. But you could have been caught, you could have been killed.
[time=804] I know, but he said the Lord brought us to your door. How could I refuse?
[time=810] Well, where did you hide them? I mean, your place couldn't have been that big.
[time=814] On the terrace. Under some flax I had just watched. It was drawing in the sun.
[time=819] And the guards didn't think to look there?
[time=822] Come on, Rahab. We know you got him in there. Yeah, we saw two guys stuck in here. You can't fool us.
[time=828] Two men? Perhaps you met my cousins who were here earlier. Surely they haven't broken the law.
[time=834] Rah, you've got to rap sheet a mile long, and we'll haul you in if you make us.
[time=838] Okay. You win. There were two men here earlier, but they left when they found out what I used to do.
[time=846] Scared them off, eh? Mmm.
[time=848] Right. Look, I'm expecting someone, so please.
[time=853] Figures a woman like you is always expecting someone?
[time=857] I told you. I don't do that anymore.
[time=861] Right. So these men, which way did they go?
[time=864] I don't know, but I do know that they left a desk, and the city gates are about to close, so you'd better hurry if you want to catch them.
[time=872] Are you sure?
[time=874] Fine. Fine, Ray. But we will be keeping an eye on you.
[time=883] Oh, so you snuck them out.
[time=889] Yes, the next day. I hung a long rope out the back window.
[time=895] The guards never saw a thing.
[time=897] I told the spies to hide in the hills for three days and then returned to their camp.
[time=901] Oh, and these spies went back and an attack was planned on Jericho.
[time=906] Yes, to destroy all of Jericho, except for my home.
[time=910] You will be safe here tonight, but please.
[time=913] Promise me that you'll leave tomorrow morning before the city gates open.
[time=917] You are very brave to do this. We are ever grateful.
[time=921] I know that the Lord has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that everyone in this country is melting in fear because of you.
[time=932] When we heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea so that you could come out of Egypt and what you did in Zion and Odd, the two kings east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.
[time=943] When we heard of these things, we lost all courage because I know that your Lord, He is Lord in the heavens above and in the earth below.
[time=954] Now, please, swear to me by your Lord that you will save my family.
[time=959] Give me a sign that you will spare my family, my mother, my father, my brothers, my sisters, and all who belong to them.
[time=966] Please.
[time=970] Our lives for your lives. If you don't tell anyone what we're doing, we'll treat you kindly and faithfully when our Lord gives us this land.
[time=979] That's right. You asked them to save your family also, even though they had disowned her.
[time=987] Well, then, how did you ever convince them to come and be saved?
[time=991] Well, Ray, how do you expect me to believe this story of yours?
[time=997] The Lord brought two spies to your door and they promised to save you and your family from an attack on this city?
[time=1006] I know. I know it's hard for you to believe me, Father.
[time=1010] I haven't been worthy of your respect or of your trust in the past, but that part of my life, it's over now.
[time=1018] And I know that the Lord has given this land to the Israelites, and I know that he will destroy Jericho.
[time=1024] But these spies, they've promised to save our family.
[time=1028] And how are we to be protected in your house?
[time=1032] I will hang a scarlet cord for my window. The spies are familiar with my home.
[time=1037] I'm sure they are.
[time=1039] It isn't like that.
[time=1043] Their Lord has saved me from my old life, and I know that he will save us from the fall of Jericho.
[time=1050] Please, have faith in me, just this once.
[time=1054] Okay, Ray, we'll all be here before sundown.
[time=1063] And then they came and stormed the city, right?
[time=1068] Not quite. They marched around the city for seven days, marched, marched, and blew trumpets for seven days.
[time=1078] And we stayed inside and prayed to the Lord.
[time=1081] And then they stormed.
[time=1084] No, and then they shouted.
[time=1086] Shouted? You've got to be kidding.
[time=1088] No, they shouted.
[time=1090] The trumpets blared, and the walls fell down.
[time=1094] All of them, except for those around my house.
[time=1098] And then they stormed, and then they stormed.
[time=1101] And not a soul was spared outside my walls.
[time=1105] Wow.
[time=1107] And when there was a knock on the door, we knew it was all over.
[time=1112] One of the spies had come for us, and his name was Solomon.
[time=1117] And I asked her to marry me, right there.
[time=1120] Oh, and the Lord delivered yet again, and we believed all of us.
[time=1128] You are my hiding place.
[time=1141] You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance.
[time=1151] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you.
[time=1161] I will trust in you.
[time=1167] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[time=1180] Oh, you are my hiding place.
[time=1188] You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance.
[time=1199] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you.
[time=1209] I will trust in you.
[time=1215] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[time=1227] I will trust in you.
[time=1240] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[time=1253] You are my hiding place.
[time=1259] You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance.
[time=1270] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you.
[time=1280] I will trust in you.
[time=1285] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[time=1296] I will trust in you.
[time=1309] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[time=1321] I will trust in you.
[time=1351] Thank you, Clay, and Jan, let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[time=1367] Hey, if you are weak this morning, if you have experienced any weakness this last week,
[time=1375] struggling with any weakness this morning, if you are weak this morning, repeat after me, "I am strong in the strength of the Lord."
[time=1386] Hold on to that. Remember that. That's real.
[time=1390] That is real, and that is a great truth.
[time=1392] It is the great truth of that song, the great truth of that drama.
[time=1396] And I am so thankful to be back in this study of this great book, Joshua, back in the Old Testament.
[time=1404] We began several weeks ago, and speaking of great truths, in our first week in Joshua,
[time=1410] we came upon a foundational truth that I think bears repeating this morning.
[time=1415] We saw it in that week one, we will come back to it this morning.
[time=1419] And that great truth, my friends, is that this book, the Word of God, really, when you whittle it all down, there is a lot to whittle down there.
[time=1426] But when you really look at it from up above, you realize that this great book is the story of God's redemptive plan.
[time=1433] From the beginning all the way to the end, it is the story of God's pursuit of man.
[time=1439] We realized weeks ago that God has always, from the very beginning in Genesis, all the way through the judges and the kings and the prophets, and with the onset of the New Testament and the establishing of the church, God has always longed for a people.
[time=1456] God has always been a God who has longed for relationship with a people.
[time=1462] A people who would love him. A people who would follow him.
[time=1465] A people who would live in intimacy with him.
[time=1468] He has always been about that. He will always be about that.
[time=1471] That is who he is. Jeremiah 31.3 says he has loved you with an ever-lasting love.
[time=1479] He has been loving and he has been pursuing from eternity past to today, to the future.
[time=1485] It's just the way it is. He loves us and longs for relationship with us.
[time=1491] He designed us as well.
[time=1494] And in designing us, he is aware of the fact that each of us, down deep inside in every person in this room this morning, I think if in honesty you were to consider this, every one of you would admit what he knows to be true about us.
[time=1510] He designed us and he knows that each of us longs to be at peace with him.
[time=1518] It's amazing. Some of the instances just that I've had with folks who were dying.
[time=1525] It's amazing how people who at the end, people whose lives were so full of so many things.
[time=1535] So much stuff going on, so many things to do, so many places to go.
[time=1541] It's amazing how when it's almost over, they want to make peace.
[time=1547] They want to know what's to come.
[time=1551] There is something in us, each and every one of us, that longs to be at peace with him.
[time=1557] We long for that restful place of intimacy with him, as did the Jews long ago.
[time=1564] Since the time, think about it, since the time of the great exodus from Egypt, they had looked forward to this place that they had been promised.
[time=1573] They had been told that there would be a promised land, a place that would be theirs,
[time=1579] a land that they could possess, a place in which they could experience their God.
[time=1584] And as we come to the study of the book of Joshua, we find that the nation of Israel, the Jews, are now literally on the shore.
[time=1592] They're right there on the edge of this promised place.
[time=1597] If you go with me to Joshua, chapter 1, we find them on the verge of crossing over.
[time=1603] The only thing that was separating them from this promised land was the River Jordan, and as you turn to Joshua 1, verses 1 to 2, and then we're going to go to verses 10 through 13,
[time=1615] will be reminded of where these folks have found themselves on their journey toward this promised land.
[time=1622] If you would, in honor of God's word, allow me to read this to you.
[time=1627] Joshua 1, verses 1 to 2, verses 10 to 13.
[time=1630] Now it came about after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of none.
[time=1638] Moses is servant, saying, "Moses, my servant is dead.
[time=1642] Now therefore arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people,
[time=1649] the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel." And in verse 10 it says, "Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, "Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, "Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to cross this Jordan,
[time=1668] to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess it."
[time=1674] To the Rubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, this is it, verse 13, watch.
[time=1681] Remember, remember the word which Moses, the servant of the Lord,
[time=1687] commanded you, saying, "The Lord your God gives you what?" Say it out loud.
[time=1693] The Lord your God gives you now, after all this, through all you've been through, through all the wandering and after all the futility and after all the complaining,
[time=1705] He's going to give you a land, that's true, but what's the first thing He says, "The Lord your God gives you rest."
[time=1715] That's significant, that's powerful, and will give you this land.
[time=1723] Father, God, we stand before you again humbly, grateful,
[time=1730] and so very appreciative of the grace and mercy that you continue to extend toward us,
[time=1737] that allows us to stand here in your presence.
[time=1741] We thank you, Father, for the worship and the great truths we've already been reminded of this morning,
[time=1747] God, as we open the pages of your word, we pray that it would do what only your word can do.
[time=1754] And as we consider this story of Joshua, as we look at the unfolding drama of the Israelites,
[time=1761] God, as we consider the smoring, the things that they faced, the decisions that they had to make,
[time=1767] God, the circumstances that they found themselves in, may we realize that not much has changed,
[time=1776] and that what you called forth from them, God, you call forth from us.
[time=1781] And God, as we read this, and as we study this, our prayer is that your spirit and your word would bring these truths to life, that whatever principles we may need to consider,
[time=1792] in whatever ways we may need to be convicted, God, that your Holy Spirit would do that, and that we could be a people who would be willing and ready to follow you, to trust you,
[time=1804] to know you, and to love you.
[time=1806] God, do what you need to do, and thank you for the privilege of being here together, in your son's name we pray. Amen. You can be seated.
[time=1816] Well, as we mentioned before, let me mention to you again, this promised land, my friends.
[time=1821] This was a real land. This was a physical piece of land that, yes, in fact, God was going to give them to possess.
[time=1829] There were rivers, and there were streams, and there were mountains, and there were valleys, it was land.
[time=1834] But as we saw last time, in the end, my friends, it was much, much more.
[time=1840] It was a whole lot more. This promised land concept was a whole lot more than rocks and dirt.
[time=1847] You see, in the end, for the Jews, after 40 years of wandering in futility, it was a chance for their hunger.
[time=1855] And I don't just mean physical.
[time=1858] See, there's always two worlds kind of going on here at the same time.
[time=1861] There's always two applications.
[time=1863] This was a chance for their hunger to be satisfied, for their thirst to be quenched.
[time=1871] Really quenched.
[time=1873] It was an opportunity, this promised land, for their emptiness to be filled, for their hearts to be renewed, for their spirits to be settled in this promised land.
[time=1883] And you know what? As I think about that, there's a chance just right there, at the very beginning of our time this morning, a chance right there for you and I, I think, to find some application.
[time=1893] 'Cause I know you.
[time=1895] I know, I know most of you.
[time=1898] The more life we spend together, the more that we encounter, the more that you and I get to kind of
[time=1904] see and take in, and the relationship that God has given us.
[time=1908] I know most of you. I'm getting to know others of you.
[time=1911] You know me, and I can stand here and say to you that all that I just said there is true in your life as well. It's true in mine. We hunger.
[time=1920] Hunger. What do I mean by that?
[time=1923] Well, you know what? There is a sense so many times in you and me.
[time=1927] There's a sense where we just want more.
[time=1931] We know that we were designed to taste and to take in more
[time=1937] than we're tasting and taking in.
[time=1940] Sometimes it drives us to our knees, and sometimes there's a keen sense in each of you and myself as well.
[time=1945] There's a hunger that longs to experience more and more of what God has in store for us.
[time=1951] We're hungry at times. We're thirsty.
[time=1955] There is an emptiness that we encounter at times.
[time=1959] And there are voices. There is the enemy.
[time=1962] Always constantly inviting you to fill that emptiness in other ways.
[time=1968] There is an emptiness. Hearts grow weary and need to be renewed.
[time=1974] Our spirits at times grow unsettled, and there is a sense and a need for him to come and settle.
[time=1981] And you know there are times, and I want you to think about this, there are times when we understandably but foolishly establish our own promised land.
[time=1994] Or our own promised lands. See if it's about rest.
[time=1998] See if it's about satisfaction. If it's about a place where we have our hunger and our thirst quenched.
[time=2006] If it's about a place where we can go and have our hearts renewed.
[time=2009] See there are times when you and I understandably, because we're who we are and we've been through what we've been through,
[time=2016] we've established foolishly our own human, if you will, promised lands.
[time=2024] What do I mean? Well I just wrote some down. Some of our, not gods, but some of our promised lands.
[time=2033] Here's how it goes oftentimes.
[time=2036] I'll talk with people. We'll be in my office or we'll be in a restaurant booth somewhere.
[time=2040] I'll meet maybe I'm on the phone, but I can hear it in their voice.
[time=2043] Sometimes they'll say this, I, they'll say I, I'll tell you what, I am going to have a good family.
[time=2054] And you realize as they talked that wherever they've been or whatever they've experienced the roads they've traveled,
[time=2060] it's led them to this place where they are going to stop at nothing.
[time=2064] They believe in their heart that the end of the road for them, fulfillment, satisfaction and meaning come,
[time=2070] they are going to have a good family.
[time=2074] Past sins won't be repeated and we will be a loving, happy, fulfilled family that stays together.
[time=2082] It's like they're slamming their hand on the table saying that's what it's going to be for me.
[time=2091] And then somebody hits somebody or somebody starts drinking too much.
[time=2100] Somebody spends too much. Somebody says too much.
[time=2106] Past sins start to be repeated and it falls apart.
[time=2114] Some of our promised lands. I hear this at times, I'll be able to, you watch me.
[time=2122] I'll be able to always provide for my family.
[time=2124] I will work hard, pursue ongoing training and bring home enough from my job for my spouse and my kids to have all their needs met.
[time=2133] Again, you can sometimes sense in the voice that something may be transpired back here,
[time=2139] but now there has in the heart and spirit of this individual begun to be this picture that that's the promised land.
[time=2147] I am going to have a good job and I will provide for my family and they won't go without and their needs will be met
[time=2156] and the job is lost. Layoffs occur. A number of things transpire, but the job's gone.
[time=2171] Sometimes I hear young ladies articulate their promised land.
[time=2177] My husband will love me. They say, really love me. We'll get married and he will want to be with me.
[time=2186] I know it. He'll keep pursuing me. He'll cherish me. He'll sacrifice for me.
[time=2197] Some goes by and he leaves her. Sometimes it's not spouses, sometimes it's not jobs, sometimes it's not earning power.
[time=2209] You know what? Sometimes it's kids. Sometimes in our minds and sometimes in our spirits.
[time=2214] I hear it often. I hear adults articulating their promised land.
[time=2220] Sometimes it sounds like there's my kids. That's right. My kids will. Here's the deal. My kids will continue to love and pursue the Lord
[time=2228] after leaving home to go to school. They'll take all that we've tried to teach them and develop stronger and even more personal, spiritual convictions.
[time=2237] That's what's going to happen. That's what we're working toward. That's where I want to go.
[time=2244] And then one comes home on Thanksgiving break and tells mom and dad the Bible is a lie.
[time=2251] He learned that in philosophy, he says. And that he's become interested in Islam and is now attending a local mosque there in the town where he goes to school.
[time=2264] Promised lands. Sometimes it's more immediate. Sometimes it's very, very specific.
[time=2273] The test results will be negative. I just know it. I've got too much life to experience, too much love to offer.
[time=2286] The test results will be negative. You see, we've got to be very, very careful, my friends, with what or who we call our promised land, our place of peace and rest and fulfillment.
[time=2299] It's not a spouse. It's not getting a date. It's not a promotion.
[time=2304] Or the hope of a kid meeting all your expectations. Jobs or test results aren't the promised land.
[time=2311] It's him. He's the promised. It's God. It's loving him, my friends. It's obeying him. It's knowing him. It's walking with him for you and I.
[time=2324] This is our promised, peaceful, restful place. A relationship with him, a God who has, from the very beginning long, for nothing more than relationship with his people.
[time=2337] And in that relationship, as he grows you and as he loves you and as he changes you, you find that place of peace and rest.
[time=2348] But wait a second, because I got to say this to you, most of you know this, as good as that is and as true as that is. Guess what?
[time=2360] Even when you've got the promised land thing appropriately settled in your heart and mind, even when you're moving toward knowing and loving and obeying him,
[time=2371] the pathology test on the tumor still comes back malignant sometimes.
[time=2379] The gal you always loved and trusted cheats on you and leaves you for someone else, a son or a daughter dies way too soon.
[time=2389] My friends, even on the road toward rest, there is great heartache. There are huge obstacles.
[time=2399] Guess what Israel encountered on the way to their promised land?
[time=2405] Guess what comes in between them and this place of rest? On their way to the promised land, they come against an obstacle called Jericho.
[time=2418] That's right. People of Israel come up against a wall, a fortified city called Jericho. Look at Joshua chapter 4.
[time=2428] I want to do my very best to not only just read this to you, but I want to do my best to kind of paint this picture in a way where you can get a sense of what it must have been like to be them,
[time=2438] to be them in this place where they find themselves and to be them facing all that they would now encounter.
[time=2445] Look at Joshua 4.19. It says, "Now the people came up from the Jordan." You see that? They have crossed over the Jordan.
[time=2453] The people are now entering the land. On the 10th, they've come up from the Jordan on the 10th of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern edge of say it.
[time=2467] Jericho, Jericho. They are literally on the outskirts of Jericho. They find themselves camped out in the suburb, if you will.
[time=2480] It's within view. And there's more to it than meets the eye. I mean, as they would have, and I want you to picture this, as they would have camped there, as they would have been sitting there on the eastern edge of Jericho, they would have seen right there.
[time=2494] This was a monstrosity of a city. This thing was absolutely enormous. I mean, it was huge, but more than its physical size, and more than the overwhelming presence, you know, that it would have cast in its shadow on this people as they camp on the eastern edge.
[time=2517] There was going on in their minds. There was the sense of knowing what the spies had told them before. You see, the spies, remember, had gone into the land.
[time=2527] And the spies had brought back a report about this city, about these people, about what was going on there. Go back to numbers. Go back to numbers 13, if you will.
[time=2539] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, numbers. Go to numbers 13, 25. Let's just revisit that for a moment. Numbers 13, 25 to 33. This is what was going on in their minds.
[time=2554] This is what they were seeing. This is what they were experiencing as they found themselves there on the eastern edge of this city.
[time=2562] When they returned the spies from spying out the land at the end of 40 days, they proceeded to come to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Peron at Kadesh.
[time=2574] And they brought back word to them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land.
[time=2581] Thus they told him and said, "We went into the land where you sent us, and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
[time=2591] Nevertheless, 28. It's like, hey, we went and it was quite a trip. And there's some really, see these apples? I mean, they're huge. It's great.
[time=2601] And the streams of the milk and honey and all that's really good. But whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa." He says, "Whoa, wait, though."
[time=2607] Because we got some really bad news. Nevertheless, the people who live in the land are strong.
[time=2616] And the cities are fortified and very large. And moreover, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
[time=2625] These would have been the Nephilim, the law, and there's a lot to talk about there, just let you know.
[time=2630] The idea there is they bumped into some really, really, really big people.
[time=2637] My generation, the birds come out of the Nephilim.
[time=2644] Amalek is living in the land of the Negeb and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites are living in the hill country.
[time=2652] And the Canaanites are living by the sea and by the side of the Jordan. Then Caleb, God loved Caleb.
[time=2659] Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, "Why?" He said, "We should by all means go up and take possession of it, for we will surely overcome it."
[time=2669] But the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people, for they are too strong for us."
[time=2677] So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out saying,
[time=2683] "The land through which we have gone, inspiring it out, is a land that devours."
[time=2689] This is what they're thinking, camped on the eastern edge of Jericho.
[time=2694] It's a land that devours its inhabitants and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size.
[time=2701] There also we saw the Nephilim. There we go, the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim.
[time=2706] And we became like grasshoppers in our own sight and so we were in their sight.
[time=2712] Jericho, my friends, was one of the oldest, most formidable fortresses of its day.
[time=2717] It was built with military genius.
[time=2720] It was built with a design to defeat and conquer all enemies who would even entertain the thought of somehow trying to capture it.
[time=2729] It's immense outer wall, the giants who lived in the land, coupled with Israel's lack of military training and equipment.
[time=2737] There were no battering rams, there were no weapons, there was no preparation.
[time=2741] All of it led to what must have been an extremely fearful and uneasy position.
[time=2747] How are you doing if you're an Israelite on the eastern edge of Jericho?
[time=2753] And you've come into the promised land and now this is what you look at, this incredible, enormous monstrosity of a city,
[time=2762] filled with giants and people who you've been told are warriors, are wretched and ruthless and skilled.
[time=2774] Joshua 6, 1-5, here's how it plays out.
[time=2780] Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel.
[time=2786] No one went out and no one came in.
[time=2789] I love how the gals depicted this in the drama for us this morning.
[time=2793] And as fearful as the Israelites must have been, many of them, in light of Numbers 13, 25-33 in the report of the spies.
[time=2802] Interesting, isn't it that Jericho was afraid of them?
[time=2805] Jericho had heard of this great God, Jehovah.
[time=2809] Jericho had heard about what he had done for his people.
[time=2812] Jericho had heard about the parting of the Red Sea.
[time=2815] Jericho was tightly shut.
[time=2817] And the Lord says to Joshua, picture this verse too.
[time=2820] The Lord says to Joshua, see, can you see him just kind of?
[time=2824] Joshua just looking at this incredible fortified city and God says, see, I have given Jericho into your hand
[time=2832] with its king and the valiant warriors.
[time=2835] You shall march, Joshua's going, all right.
[time=2838] All right, how are you going to do this?
[time=2841] You shall march around the city.
[time=2844] True story now.
[time=2846] This is not myth.
[time=2847] This is not make believe.
[time=2849] This is how God did this.
[time=2851] You shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once.
[time=2856] You shall do so for six days.
[time=2859] Also, seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark.
[time=2865] Then on the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
[time=2872] It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet,
[time=2879] all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat.
[time=2889] Flat there, the wall of the city will fall down flat, literally in the Hebrew there, in its place.
[time=2900] It'll just come straight down.
[time=2905] And the people will go up, your people, Joshua, my people, the Israelites, will go up every man.
[time=2911] Now, look at this phrase.
[time=2913] Everybody say this phrase out loud right now.
[time=2915] Every man will go where?
[time=2918] Straight ahead.
[time=2921] I want you to remember that.
[time=2923] Straight ahead.
[time=2929] You know, most of you know this about me.
[time=2933] And I've said this to you before. I just got to say it to you again.
[time=2936] I love the Scriptures.
[time=2942] I love the God of the Scriptures more granted, but I just love this book and its truth, and I love the way God presents it.
[time=2953] And I love what it does. I love how it speaks to you and to me when we allow it to.
[time=2958] Because you know what, here's my point. When I read six, one to five, and I see in my mind's eye, Joshua, camped outside this ominous, overwhelming wall with a vicious, well-trained enemy inside.
[time=2971] You kind of go, wow, but then it dawns on you, or it dawns on me, and maybe some of you in the room, because you see, I've read Joshua 1 before.
[time=2980] And we didn't spend a whole lot of time in Joshua 1 a few weeks ago, but it's just so amazing, because many of you in the room this morning,
[time=2987] if I were to begin right now, to quote for you some very well-known verses from Joshua 1.
[time=2994] I mean, when you just pick up the Bible and you read Joshua 1, you go, wow.
[time=2998] I mean, it's inspiring stuff. It's motivating truth. I mean, you read Joshua 1, you go, man, I want that to be me.
[time=3007] I want to live and think that way. Joshua 1, whoa, you just go, yeah.
[time=3014] Well, then you read Joshua 2, and 3, and 4, and 5, and now you come to Joshua 6.
[time=3022] And now you've got this Israelite camp, and this young guy named Joshua who maybe felt like he was in a little bit over his head, and they're camped on the eastern edge of this monster city with this wall that you can't even imagine.
[time=3036] That circles this place full of warriors and ruthless giants and people that want to kill him.
[time=3043] And you're camped over here in the shade of this thing, and then you go back to Joshua 1.
[time=3050] And now you realize, when you go back, go ahead, go back to Joshua 1.
[time=3054] Now when you read Joshua 1, 5 to 9, you go, whoa.
[time=3060] Oh, you go, wow, I get it. Joshua 1, verse 5, tell me this didn't make a little bit more sense to Joshua as he camps there on the eastern edge of Jericho.
[time=3075] He remembers back to when God said to him, verse 5, "No man will be able to stand before you, Joshua, all the days of your life, just as I have been with Moses, I will what?
[time=3088] I will be with you. I will not fail you." Or forsake you, here you go, verse 6, be strong.
[time=3095] Go ahead, look at that city. Go ahead, look at that wall. Go ahead, look at those valiant warriors.
[time=3101] Go ahead, look at the giants. Be strong and courageous for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
[time=3115] Only be strong and very courageous. Now watch, be careful to do according to all the law which Moses, my servant, commanded you.
[time=3124] Do not turn from it to the what? Or to the what? But go where?
[time=3134] Yeah, I got goosebumps.
[time=3138] So that you may have success for wherever you go. This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.
[time=3151] For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success. Have I not, verse 9, have I not commanded you?
[time=3158] Be strong and courageous. Do not tremble or be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.
[time=3168] Now how's that in light of Joshua 6? 1-5. I don't know about you, but if I'm Joshua, and I'm back here in chapter 1, and God says, "Hey, wait a minute, I've got to tell you something.
[time=3181] Remember this, be strong and courageous." And within like five minutes he tells me to be strong and courageous 26 times, and then he adds on at the end, don't tremble or be dismayed, but be strong and courageous.
[time=3192] He says it again. If I'm Joshua, I'm wondering man, what in the world where is he taking me? What am I going to encounter? What is around the corner?
[time=3202] Well now we're at 6, verses 1-5, and we have arrived at the corner, and there he sees it.
[time=3212] A huge obstacle, my friends, in between him, in between them, and the promised land.
[time=3224] What do you do? I'm asking you, they had Jericho. What's your Jericho? What stands between you and your rest?
[time=3239] What are you supposed to do in the aftermath of adultery and broken trust? What do you spend really? What are you supposed to do when a loved one passes away unexpectedly?
[time=3251] What are you supposed to do with a failing business? What do you do with a troubled teen?
[time=3257] Yeah, you know what? In fact, what if you are the troubled teen? We always talk about you. Let's just shoot straight here. What if you're 14, 15, 16, 17?
[time=3268] You're in this room today, and you're trying somehow to survive in this compromised world that screams into your heart and your ear every day.
[time=3279] The enemy says to you, young man or you young woman, "Hey, go a different way."
[time=3288] What are you supposed to do when the enemy's attack and temptations are relentless? What do you do when parenting well seems to be so confusing or full of conflict?
[time=3298] What do you do when you're pregnant with no husband and a family that's bailing on you? What do you do when you're dying?
[time=3307] Maybe you've got two months, maybe you've got six, maybe it's a year.
[time=3313] What kind of Jericho stands between you and God this morning, and let me just say this to you.
[time=3320] Some of you in the room this morning, and you know how I feel about you, I'm so thankful that you're here.
[time=3327] And I'm so thankful that you've allowed us to share in your journey toward Christ, but there are some here in the room this morning and you don't know him.
[time=3336] You haven't fully surrendered your heart and life to him, and without it, without him and that relationship you have, no peace.
[time=3347] And I long for you to have that peace.
[time=3351] And I remember Jesus' words in Matthew 11, 28, he says, "Come to me all who are, what, weary and heavy laden, burdened, and I will give you what, rest.
[time=3364] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls, your promised land."
[time=3375] My friends is in him, in a relationship with him, and those of you in the room that know him, I hope you won't skip over Joshua one too quickly, because for you today, if you know him, maybe an application for you this morning would be this.
[time=3389] In the midst of whatever it is that has plopped itself in between you and him.
[time=3394] One thing he says be strong, he says be courageous, he says don't be dismayed.
[time=3398] One thing he says there in chapter 1, verses 5 to 9 is don't you for a moment stray from this?
[time=3404] And so I would ask you, believer this morning, it says each and every day, you meditate on it day and night, are you doing that?
[time=3412] Do you even know how to do that? You that know him, is there a way in which you can sit and meet with him and listen to him and take in what is true and right and good and have it build and strengthen your heart and soul so that you can make decisions that allow you to walk straight and not to the left and not to the right?
[time=3432] And if you need help with that, let us know. We have the resource and we have the people, we could connect you to certain settings where you could as a believer know what it means and experience what it means to meditate on his word day and night, to have the truths of God's word be something that you interact with not just on Sunday morning but each and every day of your life.
[time=3457] You and I desperately need it and if we can help you, experience that on a more meaningful level, please, please let us know.
[time=3465] Stand with me, would you?
[time=3470] Father in heaven, we thank you for this great truth, this book that is full of life-changing truth and God, this great truth in the book of Joshua.
[time=3481] God, I pray that we would be so very clear this morning on that which brings fulfillment and that which doesn't.
[time=3488] God, I pray that we would look to a promised land found in you, that we would allow ourselves God the richness and the satisfaction and fulfillment of knowing you so that we could live this life in a way, God, that could make a difference for all of eternity.
[time=3505] Thank you for our time together this morning as we continue in this study as we move from Jericho on with the people of Israel.
[time=3513] I pray, God, that you would bring us back and that you would open our hearts and lives to the great truth that you'll have for us there.
[time=3520] We'll look forward to it.
