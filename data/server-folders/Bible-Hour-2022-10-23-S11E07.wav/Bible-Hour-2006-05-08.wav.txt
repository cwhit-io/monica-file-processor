[time=397] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and it is good to be
[time=408] with you again.
[time=409] It's been a few weeks since I've been able to be here in the studio and tape this spot
[time=415] for our broadcast and I got to just tell you thinking about having the chance to be with
[time=421] you again, having the chance to share some things with you again has been encouraging.
[time=427] I've been looking forward to getting back here with you on the broadcast so I'm thankful that you've tuned in and I'm so very thankful for what I see God continuing to do here in
[time=438] the Black Hawk family, here in Black Hawk Ministries, inside these four walls and outside these
[time=444] four walls, here and around the world, we continue to see God allowing us to be a part of what
[time=452] He's doing and for me personally, most of you know this, but just for me personally, to
[time=458] get to be in the mix here, to get to be with these people, to be a part of this team, to
[time=465] serve with the faithful folks who give so much of themselves here at Black Hawk, it is a
[time=471] real privilege.
[time=472] So, I'm grateful for what I get to be a part of and I want to just tell you, I've kept
[time=478] track, I don't normally, but I just thought to myself, you know I'm going to keep track over these next couple of weeks and in the last two weeks I've been approached by, stopped by, entered into conversation with 17 individuals who have stopped me in different settings and
[time=495] just thanked me for what God does through the Bible Hour broadcast.
[time=500] I can't tell you how thankful I am each and every time that happens.
[time=506] I'm so thankful that what we're able to do here in some way encourages you or it challenges
[time=513] you or God uses it to further teach and equip you in your spiritual journey.
[time=518] It's why we do what we do and we're so thankful that you're encouraged by it.
[time=523] Of the 17, I want to say this, six of them have now started attending Black Hawk.
[time=529] They were individuals who prior to then didn't have a home church and I continue to be amazed
[time=535] by that.
[time=536] So many of you out there and I know you're there because I keep meeting you, I keep bumping into you, you keep telling us your story and you're out there and you're watching right now and you don't have a home, a community of people that you really feel like you can
[time=553] identify with and enjoy being with and be spiritually and personally encouraged by.
[time=560] And several of these folks that I've talked with recently have shared with me how in the last two, three, four, five, six months they've just started coming on Sunday mornings, nine
[time=571] or 1045 and they have shared with me their gratefulness for that.
[time=576] It is a great setting.
[time=578] There isn't anything like being in that room together and I just want to invite you again if you don't have a home church, if there isn't a family that you feel deeply connected
[time=589] to, we would love to be that family.
[time=591] Come by and say hello.
[time=593] If you come by and visit, please don't leave without coming down to the front afterwards and introducing yourself to me and some other folks from our team.
[time=601] We would love to meet you and I hope you'll take us up on it.
[time=605] Hey, today we continue in our study of the book of Joshua and I'll just say this to you.
[time=610] I hope you're willing as you listen to have the Spirit of God and the Word of God remind
[time=616] you today, I think in a powerful way, that he is so consumed with God is so concerned
[time=623] and so given to the condition not of your external life, what you might look like or
[time=629] what you might sound like spiritually.
[time=632] He is so concerned and so committed to your heart, to the internal reality of him at work
[time=638] in your life and I hope as you watch and I hope as you listen, you'll allow God's Word
[time=644] to grow you and speak to you in that regard.
[time=647] Thank you so very much for tuning in, it's good to be with you again.
[time=651] Have a great great day and we'll hope to see you soon, God bless you.
[time=662] He's worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy to be braced
[time=677] for ever and ever day, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're
[time=687] worthy to be braced for ever and ever day, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy,
[time=697] Jesus, you're worthy to be braced for ever and ever day, you're worthy, you're worthy,
[time=708] you're worthy, Jesus, you're worthy to be braced forever and ever day.
[time=722] He is worthy, worthy to be praised, worthy to be glorified, magnified, honored and lifted
[time=730] high by every tribe, by every tongue, by every nation, by every people group around
[time=738] the globe, let every kindred, every tribe in this whole world, hail him and honor him
[time=746] as King Jesus, may every knee bow and every tongue confess that he is God alone.
[time=752] We're going to sing the verse of that hymn again and every kindred and every tribe on this terrestrial ball to him, all majesty ascribe and crown him Lord of everything.
[time=763] As we sing it together, will you make it your prayer that this would happen to the fullest
[time=770] extent that God desired it to happen, that every knee would bow and understand that he
[time=777] is Lord of all, let's sing it together.
[time=782] Let every kindred, every tribe on this terrestrial ball to him, all majesty ascribe and crown
[time=803] him Lord of all, to him all majesty ascribe and crown him Lord of all.
[time=825] Amen, if you believe that, would you say amen?
[time=830] [AMEN] And have a seat please, thank you.
[time=835] What was it about David?
[time=838] Think about this with me.
[time=841] What is it about the underdogs in Scripture?
[time=845] Think about a few underdogs in Scripture.
[time=849] Think about a few situations in the pages of God's Word where the underdog, the one that
[time=855] was supposedly or seemingly weaker came out on top.
[time=860] Think about the situations where physical prowess and strength, I mean if you just looked at the stats, if you just looked at the data, you know, physical strength and prowess should have won the day but instead the underdog comes through.
[time=875] What's going on there?
[time=877] Why so many times do we see that happen?
[time=879] Think about David and Goliath, many of you know the story of the young scrawny little,
[time=885] this is David kind of pre-king David days, this is back when his brothers were off fighting
[time=891] the war against the Philistines and the little shepherd, Runt, comes with the bread to give it to his big brothers and he's just a nobody and he hears the huge giant Goliath, the Philistine
[time=905] warrior.
[time=906] He hears them in the valley mocking God because of his great love for God and because of his
[time=913] great respect for God and I would suggest and submit to you this morning because of
[time=919] a heart for God.
[time=922] He stands and in a fight he should have lost if all we're looking at is the stats.
[time=930] He wins, picks up his stones and loads up his sling and the giant falls.
[time=937] See David didn't need size and strength.
[time=941] God required a heart that was fully and completely his.
[time=947] I think about Gideon, some of you know the story of Gideon found there in the book of Judges, Gideon and his army doing their best to go and again stand for God and represent
[time=959] that which was true and Gideon begins this process with an army of about, I think it was about 32,000 soldiers and God and his unique and powerful way over a series of events.
[time=971] He kind of whittles that 32,000 down to an army of 300 and there's Gideon and his 300
[time=978] facing the Midianites and the Amalekites, thousands and thousands and thousands of warrior soldiers
[time=984] in their midst and God takes Gideon and his 300 to victory.
[time=990] Gideon didn't need thousands and thousands of soldiers know what God asked for and required
[time=996] was his heart, a heart that would trust and a heart that was humble and a heart that was
[time=1006] his, God's.
[time=1008] I think about Daniel, in Daniel chapter 6 and what transpired there as he shows and expresses
[time=1016] his heart through his commitment to pray and communicate to his God, he ends up in the lion's den and in a scene or a scenario there that should have obviously ended in a brutal
[time=1027] and torturous death, God prevails and the lion's mouths are closed and we see Daniel coming out of the lion's den, not with physical prowess or strength but with heart.
[time=1040] I think about Moses, I think about Moses who couldn't even put a sentence together, I think
[time=1047] about Moses and his great fear of going before Pharaoh but there he goes and there he stands and there he communicates and in the end wins the day not because of great eloquence but because of a great trust and heart that stemmed from a, a great trust in God that stemmed
[time=1063] from a heart, a heart that was truly his.
[time=1071] How's your heart this morning?
[time=1075] What's the posture of your heart?
[time=1080] Not asking about your externals, not asking about your gifts or your strengths or your
[time=1088] talents, I'm asking about your heart.
[time=1094] I've learned from my own study of the scriptures, my friends, that heart trumps physical or
[time=1102] external prowess all the time and the same is true for us spiritually.
[time=1109] I want you to think about it, I want you to see this, I want you to realize this today, we might be, we might be big, you know, we might be big, you or I might be in three, four
[time=1119] Bible studies a week, we might be spiritually bright, we might win the debates, we might possess impressive spiritual resumes with books read and conferences attended and ministry
[time=1130] involvement and positions held but if he doesn't have your heart, I mean really, if he doesn't
[time=1139] have your heart, if our hearts aren't humble, if our hearts aren't hungry before him, if
[time=1145] there isn't a deep devotion at the heart level, we lose.
[time=1152] And as we come back to the book of Joshua, this morning we find in chapter five, an event
[time=1158] that took place which illustrates this very principle.
[time=1162] Come with me if you would back to Joshua chapter five, I realize last week we kind of made our way up to some things in Joshua six, I want to back you up just a chapter and share
[time=1172] with you this morning a very significant event.
[time=1176] I think sometimes we overlook it or sometimes we fly by it because of its content but I'm going to do my best this morning with you to address the content and I hope help you see in the midst of this content here in chapter five a very, very crucial, very, very important
[time=1192] lesson.
[time=1193] Come with me and allow me to read you this morning, Joshua chapter five verses one to twelve and it reads as follows, now it came about when all the kings of the Amorites who
[time=1204] were beyond the Jordan to the west and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea heard how the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel until
[time=1215] they had crossed that their hearts melted and there was no spirit in them any longer
[time=1222] because of the sons of Israel.
[time=1223] See word of what God had done there had spread, the kings of the land were now keenly aware of what the God of Israel had accomplished and so now the Israelites have crossed the kings have heard about it, their hearts have melted, they know what's coming and at that time verse two the Lord said to Joshua, make for yourself, make for yourself flint knives,
[time=1246] that would be stone, a kind of stone, a kind of rock, make for yourself flint knives and circumcised, again the sons of Israel the second time.
[time=1258] So Joshua made himself flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibbeth Harloth.
[time=1265] This is verse four, the reason why Joshua circumcised them, all the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war died in the wilderness along the way after
[time=1276] they came out of Egypt.
[time=1278] For all the people who came out out of Egypt were circumcised but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
[time=1289] For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the nation that is the men of war who came out of Egypt perished because they did not listen to the voice of
[time=1300] the Lord, to whom the Lord had sworn that he would not let them see the land which the Lord had sworn to their fathers to give us a land flowing with milk and honey.
[time=1310] Their children, verse seven, whom he raised up in their place, Joshua circumcised for
[time=1316] they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them along the way.
[time=1322] Now when they had finished circumcising all the nation, quite a thought, they remained
[time=1328] in their places in the camp until they were healed.
[time=1331] Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you."
[time=1337] So the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.
[time=1342] Verse ten, while the sons of Israel camped at Gilgal, they observed the Passover on the evening of the 14th day of the month on the desert plains of Jericho.
[time=1352] On the day after the Passover, on that very day they ate some of the produce of the land,
[time=1358] unleavened cakes and parched grain.
[time=1361] The manna which God had been providing, the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten some of the produce of the land so that the sons of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate some of the yield of the land of Canaan during that year.
[time=1378] Father God, we stand before you this morning and we again come humbly into your presence
[time=1384] and as we continue God to follow this unfolding story of your relationship with these people.
[time=1392] God as we continue at so many points to identify with them.
[time=1396] And God as we come again to see what you would have for them and what you would in turn half for us this morning, we thank you for the privilege of doing so.
[time=1406] And God there are many in the room myself included who stand here before you today and we need to be reminded, we need to be taught, God we need to see this truth in such a way
[time=1420] that it would make a difference in the way we think and the way we choose and the way we live and God we can't do that on our own.
[time=1429] God may your Holy Spirit be at work in this time.
[time=1434] May He lead us and reveal truth to us that would allow us to be a people.
[time=1439] It's what you've always wanted.
[time=1440] It's what you've always longed for, God of people who would represent a people who would stand and be distinct, God of people who would internally and externally honor you with their
[time=1452] lives.
[time=1453] And so God as we read this and as we study this this morning, may you lead and move us in that direction for it's in your son's name that we pray, amen.
[time=1462] You can be seated.
[time=1463] All right, so let me just try and say it to you like this.
[time=1469] The question here as we jump into chapter 5 verses 1 to 12, as you read through this
[time=1475] and as you follow along with the people of Israel and now we come to this passage here, you kind of got to ask yourself the question, why circumcision?
[time=1484] Okay, and I just got to say this, okay, because I didn't say this first hour, I'm just going to say it second hour because you know how sometimes first hour you go along and you'll learn as you go.
[time=1495] So first hour, it was like there was this elephant in the room and nobody was talking
[time=1501] about it.
[time=1502] So I just figured out of the gate, I'll just tell you, the message today is about circumcision.
[time=1508] So there, everybody all right with that?
[time=1511] And if you don't know what it is, ask your mom and dad and mom and dad, you're welcome.
[time=1518] So, but there's a great history to this thing and there's a great spiritual lesson to be
[time=1526] learned as we think about it and learn maybe a little bit more about it and give some thought to it in this time here this morning.
[time=1532] So, so why, so why now and why in this place is this such a big deal?
[time=1539] Why does he on the plains of Jericho?
[time=1542] I mean with the Jordan having been crossed and the land there for the taking, God does
[time=1548] this amazing kind of time out.
[time=1552] We need to, we need to address something.
[time=1555] We need to give some time and we need to give some attention to something.
[time=1559] And it's this, it's this issue of circumcision.
[time=1564] And I want you to realize the history here just for a moment.
[time=1568] They had been, they had been wandering in the wilderness for how many years?
[time=1575] Lay it louder, 40 years.
[time=1578] And they had been wandering in the wilderness.
[time=1580] The 40 years in the wandering was due to the fact that, that again and again and again and again my friends, they had shown themselves to be a criticizing and complaining and disobedient
[time=1592] and wandering people.
[time=1593] They had refused to show their faithfulness to God.
[time=1596] They had refused to live in distinct ways and so God allows them to wander.
[time=1602] They don't trust him, they don't listen to him.
[time=1606] They weren't at all the distinct and set apart and the holy people that he had hoped they would be.
[time=1613] And so for 40 years they wander.
[time=1617] And in 40 years of wandering, okay, listen, in 40 years of wandering, in 40 years of rebellion,
[time=1623] in 40 years of confusion, in 40 years of stiff-necked rebellion, guess what tends to get a little
[time=1631] bit hard?
[time=1634] You're what?
[time=1635] Your heart.
[time=1636] I mean you know that.
[time=1639] You and I both know that, that in our rebellion and in our sinfulness, in our moving away from
[time=1645] what God has called us to so many times, the one part of us that is so affected is our
[time=1651] heart.
[time=1653] And the heart becomes hardened and the heart becomes calloused and the heart, it becomes
[time=1659] scabbed over if you will, it just begins to kind of shrivel and shrink and it's not at
[time=1665] all the heart, not at all in that condition what God designed it to be.
[time=1672] And so circumcision, and I'm not going to get into the details and this is not meant
[time=1678] to be funny in any way, you know, but I've been around newborns, I've been in the, I've
[time=1686] been in the back room with the doctor, many of you have as well and even if you haven't, you pretty much get the gist.
[time=1695] Something that was covered is laid open, something that was hidden is brought to light.
[time=1705] And God, after 40 years, He knew, He saw, He sensed it was time for this new generation
[time=1716] of Israelites to look and sound and act like God's people.
[time=1721] They needed to once again observe the Passover and become spiritually sensitized again to
[time=1727] their God and therefore God called for the circumcision, an outward, an outward sign,
[time=1735] an outward physical sign that was to indicate and reveal an internal spiritual reality.
[time=1744] It was a sign of being consecrated, it was a sign of being devoted, it was a sign of being surrendered, it was a sign of being first and foremost and ultimately His.
[time=1757] An external outward sign of an internal spiritual reality.
[time=1763] God was more concerned even though we come here to this physical act, if you will.
[time=1770] The point is that God was more concerned about their heart, their spiritual condition than their physical strength with Jericho looming on the horizon.
[time=1779] You see, it wasn't the battle, God didn't stop them here in chapter 5 to give attention to or address their battle skills.
[time=1787] Battle skills didn't need sharpening.
[time=1789] It wasn't that they needed the latest in armament, they needed to realign themselves spiritually
[time=1795] with their God.
[time=1797] He had already won the battle, the battle was over.
[time=1800] Jericho was going to fall, he knew that, he knew that their hearts needed to be rekindled.
[time=1806] Not their talent, not their skill.
[time=1811] And I want to just remind you of this this morning, I think most of you in the room know this, I think most of you in the room would be familiar with this truth and if there's somebody here who's not, I just want to make sure I at least say this to you.
[time=1825] What talent and skill, maybe I'll just say it to you this way, do you realize how dangerous
[time=1834] talent is?
[time=1838] Do you realize how dangerous personal ability and great giftedness can be?
[time=1844] So oftentimes we want to focus on this.
[time=1847] I, for one, many of you in the room, I find myself prone to kind of lift it up.
[time=1851] I tend to tout it, I tend to observe it, I tend to be in awe of it.
[time=1856] We as a culture tend to look at talent and skill and the external ability to do whatever
[time=1862] it is we might be talking about doing it, might be hitting a golf ball, it might be baking a cake, it might be designing a plane, it could be a number of things but so many
[time=1872] times we make such a big deal out of one's talent and one's skill and one's ability.
[time=1880] But what you have to, I think, at least stop this morning and give some thought to here
[time=1886] is that oftentimes talent doesn't lead to godliness or great kingdom efforts.
[time=1894] Too many times great talent leads to pride and efforts that are more about me.
[time=1903] Has God given you a talent?
[time=1905] Are there external pursuits that you enjoy engaging in or are there some things that God has given you and a unique ability in?
[time=1915] You and I, wherever we fit in there, have to be so very careful and I want to just show you briefly this morning, again, what God says, God's stance, God's response to this
[time=1925] issue of talent and strength and ability.
[time=1930] Remember the words in Jeremiah, you can turn there if you'd like, Jeremiah 923, Jeremiah
[time=1936] 923 and 24, "Thus says the Lord," listen, he begins right out of the gate here, he begins
[time=1943] to address some physical external things that oftentimes we can tend to kind of get caught up in, not letting out a wise man boast of his wisdom.
[time=1952] Anybody smart here in the room?
[time=1955] Not a wise man, boast of his wisdom and let not the mighty man boast of his might.
[time=1962] Anybody strong?
[time=1967] Let not a rich man, boast of his riches, but let him who boasts, boasts of this, that
[time=1975] he understands and knows me.
[time=1981] There you go, that which truly and really matters, that you would understand and know
[time=1988] him.
[time=1989] You may own a lot, you may know a lot, you may be able to lift a lot.
[time=1994] There may be a lot about you that externally is really special or unique, but God whittles it all down for you in the end and says, let him who boasts, boasts of this, that he understands
[time=2005] and knows me, that I am the Lord who exercises loving kindness, justice and righteousness
[time=2011] on earth.
[time=2014] Paul knew this.
[time=2015] We not only see this in the pages of the Old Testament, but as the Word of God continues to unfold, we come to Paul's letter to the church at Corinth.
[time=2024] Paul says in 1 Corinthians, 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 2, listen to this.
[time=2029] He says, "For I, Paul, talking about the way he came at his ministry, there at the church in Corinth." He says, "For I, when I came, I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[time=2042] I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
[time=2048] And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration
[time=2055] of the Spirit and of power." Why?
[time=2058] So that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of who, men, but on the power of who.
[time=2066] You don't get the sense Paul was too caught up in the externals, more concerned about
[time=2072] a heart.
[time=2074] The psalmist knows this, look at Psalm 51-17, Psalm 51-17 says it so well.
[time=2081] The sacrifices of God, you see it there?
[time=2084] The sacrifices of God are a broken what?
[time=2087] A broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart.
[time=2093] These are the things that please God.
[time=2096] These are the things that bring great honor to him.
[time=2098] Oh God, you will not despise.
[time=2102] So back to Joshua 5, and with the wall of Jericho before them, with giants in the land
[time=2110] and the fight of a lifetime, staring them in the face.
[time=2115] Again, put yourself in Joshua's sandals.
[time=2119] I mean, you know now, you can sense, you don't know exactly what's coming, but the waters have been parted, the nation has entered the land, you're on the plains of Jericho, you can see Jericho, you know something's got to be brewing.
[time=2134] In God's heart and mind, you realize from what you've been told and from what you believe to be true, that surely now it must be time to take that place.
[time=2143] Surely it must be time to inhabit the land, and I can just kind of picture him.
[time=2148] I can picture him there in his tent just waiting for that first order, and here it comes.
[time=2155] Make knives and circumcise the entire nation.
[time=2164] Think maybe he might have been anticipating something else.
[time=2169] Imagine how all the men fell.
[time=2173] All of a sudden, what surely was to come has now been put on hold.
[time=2178] Make knives from stones and circumcise all the men.
[time=2182] I mean, they're thinking, where's the battering rams?
[time=2186] They're thinking, where's the, I mean, Jericho, I didn't tell you this last week, the wall was anywhere, archeologists will tell you, and the studies that have been done would show you that the wall of Jericho, the outer wall, was anywhere from 8 to 12 feet thick.
[time=2206] And as they see this wall, and as they realize there is an impending battle, their minds, their military minds, their desire to fight and honor and defend God and take the land,
[time=2217] must have been going other places.
[time=2218] And now he says, wait a minute, we're going to do this, circumcision.
[time=2222] Let me just tell you a few things about it, I think worth noting, theologically, theologically
[time=2230] circumcision first gained importance through its connection with faith in Yahweh, and through
[time=2236] its obligatory role in Judaism as a sign of membership in the covenant.
[time=2241] You find it in Genesis, you can write this down, Genesis 17, 1 to 14, circumcision there
[time=2247] is first described, and it's commanded by Yahweh as the sign and seal of His covenant
[time=2253] with Abraham.
[time=2256] As the story of the nation of Israel unfolds, many scholars believe that circumcision gained
[time=2264] maybe its most important place in Judaic history during the later exiles.
[time=2270] Because of the later exiles, some of you know that as the nation of Israel progressed and as their unfaithfulness to God progressed, there was a time where God said, that's it, I'm going to have you taken captive and there was the Babylonian captivity, there was the Assyrian captivity, the nation literally taken from their land into other places far away
[time=2291] to serve other kings.
[time=2294] Because of the abolition in these exiles, of all of their regulations, all of their feasts,
[time=2300] all of their sacrifices, all which they celebrated as a nation with all that stuff gone, the individual
[time=2307] and family now were suddenly summoned to make a stand.
[time=2313] Circumcision.
[time=2315] Since the Babylonians did not practice circumcision, the observance of it became a new confessional
[time=2321] status for these exiles.
[time=2324] It became the question of their witness of Yahweh and a very important distinguishing
[time=2330] mark of their covenant with him.
[time=2334] Now in this occasion, back to Joshua 5, in this occasion with a new generation ready to move into the promised land, it was necessary in view of the possible intermingling of the
[time=2345] conquerors and the conquered and the distinctive marks of the Abrahamic covenant that should have been and needed to be preserved.
[time=2353] So it's a new day and it's a new opportunity for hearts to be consecrated to, for hearts
[time=2363] to be given to, for hearts to be devoted to him, an outward physical sign of an inward
[time=2372] reality, a very physical thing, true, part of the law, part of the Torah, yes, but God
[time=2380] has always from the very beginning, my friends, God has always been about the heart.
[time=2387] God, let me say it to you this way, God has never been about the external.
[time=2391] Primarily, it has never been about the external alone, even with circumcision.
[time=2399] There has always been something else that God was wanting.
[time=2403] There has always been something else that God was after in all of the law, in all that
[time=2409] is laid out, in all that is required.
[time=2411] It was never about just doing the things, it was always about the heart that was grown
[time=2418] in the midst of this toward their God.
[time=2422] And just to give you a few examples of what it is that God has always been about as it
[time=2430] relates to the external things that He called them to, and even specifically with this issue
[time=2437] of circumcision, look with me at Jeremiah 4.
[time=2439] We're going to look at just a few passages here where I want you to sense the connection, not that I'm making, but my friends, the connection that God makes to even this, this
[time=2449] external act that we talk about this morning, Jeremiah 4-4, circumcise yourselves to the
[time=2455] Lord and remove the four skins of your what, say it, heart, He just says it right there.
[time=2462] He just takes it from the physical and He moves it to the spiritual and in the process communicates to them and to you and I that this, this is what He's after.
[time=2471] This is what He wants consecrated.
[time=2474] This is the distinguishing mark that He longs to have.
[time=2481] Remove the four skins of your heart, men of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem.
[time=2487] The verse goes on, "Or else my wrath will go forth like fire and burn with none to quench
[time=2494] it because of the evil of your deeds." Jeremiah 4-4, go a few pages over in Jeremiah, to Jeremiah 9.
[time=2503] Jeremiah, we were just there a little while ago, go to Jeremiah 9-25 and 26.
[time=2509] You go to Jeremiah 9-25, it says this, "Behold, the days are coming," declares the Lord, "that
[time=2515] I will punish all who are circumcised and ye all who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised."
[time=2524] Well, how can you be circumcised but uncircumcised?
[time=2528] Keep going, Egypt and Judah and Edom and the sons of Amon and Moab and all those inhabiting
[time=2535] the desert who clip the hair on their temples for all the nations are uncircumcised and
[time=2543] all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of what heart?
[time=2552] It is what He has always been about.
[time=2555] It is the distinguishing trait that He has always valued.
[time=2560] And yes, He puts some value for some obvious reasons on some physicalness there, but there
[time=2566] was behind that then and there is today.
[time=2571] Great importance placed on the inward spiritual reality of a heart given to Him.
[time=2577] Deuteronomy 10-16, one more.
[time=2580] So right there, circumcise your what, say it, and stiffen your neck no longer.
[time=2586] A heart circumcised, put in direct right there in parallel, right there in that verse.
[time=2592] The soft heart, the heart late bear, the heart given to Him, said in direct comparison to
[time=2601] the stiff neck, to the stiff neck, that's this picture of rebellion.
[time=2605] That's this picture of me doing what I want to do, me going where I want to go, me thinking what I want to think, me, physical, external.
[time=2617] He has always been about the heart because, listen, because when He has someone's heart
[time=2623] and He wanted this from the nation of Israel, when He has someone's heart, they make much of who, Him.
[time=2632] A preoccupation with the external tends to disengage the heart and leads people to make
[time=2639] much of themselves.
[time=2645] And He didn't want that for them as they moved across the plains of Jericho toward the battle
[time=2652] of a lifetime and the battles that would come and the opportunity that He knew existed.
[time=2657] He wanted their hearts to be His.
[time=2660] He wanted them to be a people who would make much of Him.
[time=2663] And you know what my friends?
[time=2664] He wants you and I to be a people with circumcised hearts, willing to make much of Him.
[time=2673] Can I just give you three things this morning?
[time=2675] If you've got a pen, please write this down.
[time=2678] Before you or I go up against our Jericho, we talked about that last week.
[time=2685] Before you or I enter into whatever battle He may have, whatever fight we may need to fight, whatever stand we might need to take.
[time=2695] Before you and I move forward into the land, He calls us to have hearts that are circumcised.
[time=2701] And I want to just give you three things here.
[time=2703] As I study the passages, many of the ones I just read to you, and as you look at this
[time=2709] issue of God wanting people to have hearts that are circumcised, there are a number of
[time=2715] things connected to it.
[time=2717] I pulled out three things this week that again and again and again, He connects to this issue
[time=2723] of a circumcised heart.
[time=2725] And so as you think about your heart this week, and as you live your life this week, and as you make choices this week, and as you parent this week, as you conduct yourself in marriage this week, as you go to work and function as an employee this week, as you are a Christ follower, in whatever setting you find yourself in, how about this week we go with hearts laid bare?
[time=2748] How about we go this week with hearts consecrated to Him?
[time=2753] A circumcised heart.
[time=2754] Here you go.
[time=2755] Three things.
[time=2756] Number one, if you're going to have a heart that's truly circumcised you must confess
[time=2762] your sin to Him.
[time=2768] My friends if you're walking around today, if you try to walk around tomorrow, if there's any attempt made at all on your part, to go and walk with Him to somehow live this life
[time=2780] and choose what you should choose and go where you should go and have all of that in some
[time=2786] way honor Him if you try and do that with unconfessed sin, somehow you think you can
[time=2793] hide that from Him.
[time=2796] If somehow you think you can keep that from Him, He says no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[time=2803] I want to, I want to lay that bare.
[time=2807] I want you just to open that up.
[time=2810] A circumcised heart, confess your sin to Him, whatever it might be.
[time=2819] Look what David said in Psalm 51, Psalm 51 verses 1 to 4, there may, you know what, there
[time=2825] may be some people here in the room this morning who need right now.
[time=2830] I don't know what you've done.
[time=2831] I don't know what choices you've made.
[time=2834] I'm not sure what's transpired, maybe even in the last few days, but there may be some people right here in this room right now or you may be watching on the broadcast and you may need right now to confess your sin to Him.
[time=2851] Here are some, here are some words here right from the pages of Scripture is a guide away
[time=2858] in which you can do, David did it, David confesses this after the whole Bathsheba incident.
[time=2866] There you go, be gracious to me, oh God, according to your loving kindness, according
[time=2873] to the greatness of your compassion, blot out my transgressions.
[time=2880] Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin, for I know my transgressions.
[time=2892] There's a powerful line right here and my sin is ever before me.
[time=2901] Go back to that.
[time=2902] Go back to verse 3 for a second.
[time=2903] You all see that?
[time=2905] Understand that, right?
[time=2908] He lives here.
[time=2909] My sin is ever before me.
[time=2912] He lives and I hope you and I live with the constant realization of who we are.
[time=2920] The more and more you know Him, the more and more you know God, the more and more you are exposed to His attributes and His way and His truth, the more we realize who we are and
[time=2932] our sinfulness is ever, ever before us.
[time=2938] Verse 4, "Against you, you only, I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight so that
[time=2946] you are justified when you speak and blameless when you judge.
[time=2952] You are God, and I'm not, and I have sinned and I confess that to you."
[time=2958] And you see, even David knew in the midst of all of that what it was really, really about.
[time=2964] He knew it wasn't about the externals.
[time=2966] He knew it was about the what?
[time=2968] Look at verse 10, Psalm 51-10, "Creating me a clean what?" Say it, "Heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me."
[time=2981] You want to have hearts that are circumcised, confess your sin, secondly, align, confess
[time=2987] your sin to Him, secondly write this down, align your life, align your life with Him.
[time=2994] Ephesians 4-1, would you go there?
[time=2996] Ephesians 4-1 says, "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called." Paul begs the people at Ephesus.
[time=3007] He begs them to walk, listen folks, walk, walking spiritually, walking is the everyday of your life.
[time=3013] And he's saying, "Would sins confess?
[time=3016] Would you then be willing to be the mom that He's called you to be?
[time=3023] Would you align your life?
[time=3024] Would you be the teenager?
[time=3027] Would you be the young adult, would you be the employer or employee, would you, in whatever
[time=3033] He has you doing?
[time=3035] Would you do it the way He's called you, a worthy walk, worthy of the calling, meaning
[time=3041] what you're doing is consistent with what you've been called to do.
[time=3046] And you and I know sometimes we don't do that, so we need to confess.
[time=3051] And then when we confess, we're freed up to align.
[time=3054] And when we can confess and align, we're able to then worship Him.
[time=3058] And I want to invite you again today to not live an hour and 15 minutes of worship, my
[time=3065] friends, but to live a life of worship.
[time=3069] Worship is yes, what you sing, worship is yes, what you say, worship is also what you
[time=3075] don't do.
[time=3076] Worship is practicing the presence of God.
[time=3079] Worship is what you listen to, worship is the responses that you choose, worship can be done in the van, worship can take place in the shower, worship can be in the workplace,
[time=3090] worshiping God, honoring God, pursuing God, being mindful of God, is the evidence of a
[time=3097] circumcised heart, a heart that's in confession, a heart that's constantly seeking to align
[time=3103] itself in the everyday of life.
[time=3106] I'm going to have Corbin in the gang come up right now, and we're going to just leave this morning with one great, powerful opportunity for you and I to worship.
[time=3117] And I love this song because it talks about you and I believing, I love this song.
[time=3121] It's about you and I believing in God.
[time=3124] And my friends, when our heart has been and is being on an ongoing basis, circumcised,
[time=3130] it allows us to, and when there's confession and alignment and worship, it allows that belief in Him to only be strengthened.
[time=3139] Listen as we close.
[time=3144] Though I can't see your holy face and your throne in heaven above, it seems so far away.
[time=3164] And though I can't touch, can't touch your nails, scar hands, I have a deep, unspeakable
[time=3183] joy that makes my faith to stand, Lord, I believe in you, I'll always believe in you.
[time=3202] Though I can't see you with my eyes deep in my heart, your presence I find, Lord, I believe
[time=3217] in you, and I'll keep my trust in you.
[time=3224] Let this whole world say what they meant, no one can take this show away, Lord, I believe.
[time=3245] [MUSIC - 344 seconds]
