[time=30] Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in Heaven
[time=48] and on Earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=60] the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=70] Teaching them to observe all I have to command you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=76] end of the age.
[time=93] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I am so thankful that you've tuned in to the Bible Hour.
[time=100] As most of you know who watch, I am so grateful for the friendship and for the relationship that we have.
[time=106] I don't get to meet all of you, but I'll tell you what, the relationship that we have here in this setting is one that I value greatly.
[time=114] And because of that, I want to pass along to each and every one of you an opportunity that's coming up in August, and I know that's a ways away, but I thought maybe you might want to write these dates down, you might want to be aware of this.
[time=127] This is a significant and I think very meaningful opportunity, and I want to tell you about
[time=133] it today.
[time=134] In the Leadership Summit, you've probably heard us talk about this in the past.
[time=138] This is our third year being a satellite site for the Willow Creek Association's Leadership
[time=144] Summit.
[time=145] Pastor Bill Hybels from Willow Creek years ago felt a deep sense of commitment to do
[time=152] something, to provide a situation where leaders could come and be encouraged, where leaders
[time=158] could come and be challenged, where those with the leadership gift could really be envisioned
[time=164] for what they could do and who they could be as leaders.
[time=167] And this is a great, great setting.
[time=169] You may be leading in your home.
[time=171] You may be leading in the workplace.
[time=173] You may have a team that you're responsible for.
[time=175] You may be in the educational arena.
[time=177] You may be a doctor or a lawyer.
[time=179] You may be a pastor.
[time=182] You could be doing a number of things if you are asked to lead in any way.
[time=187] This Leadership Summit Conference is for you personally, I'm deeply committed and vested
[time=193] in this conference and would love to have as many of you in the greater Fort Wayne area come and benefit from it in the same ways that I've benefited from it over the years.
[time=204] The dates are August 10, 11, and 12.
[time=206] And you'll see those dates there at the bottom of the screen.
[time=209] The Leadership Summit 06, right here at Black Hawk Ministries, live via satellite August
[time=215] 10, 11, and 12.
[time=217] Now I want you to watch this.
[time=218] This is just going to take a few minutes.
[time=220] You won't believe what they've got lined up for you.
[time=223] It is going to be an incredible couple of days.
[time=226] And I want you to watch this trailer and just get a feel and get a taste for what the summit is about and how it could benefit.
[time=233] I think it really encourages you in your leadership life.
[time=236] Watch and I'll be back in just a moment.
[time=239] Look around.
[time=241] You've been called to a great journey.
[time=246] The landscape shifts suddenly.
[time=249] Barriers and obstacles arise.
[time=252] These challenges don't deter you.
[time=255] They propel you forward because you see reality, not as it is, but how it might be.
[time=269] This is the gift of a leader, fresh perspective, and the ability to cast visions so clearly.
[time=276] Let others see it too, to make plans, inspire action, motivate teams, to invite others to
[time=285] join in an adventure that begins right where you live and ends in a world changed for the
[time=291] better, working, lifting, leading, and when necessary envisioning a new reality few have
[time=301] ever imagined.
[time=303] 70,000 liters, 160 locations, one worldwide event.
[time=311] Are you ready?
[time=314] The Leadership Summit.
[time=321] Thursday through Saturday, August 10th through the 12th, 2006.
[time=333] This summer, see reality, not as it is, but how it might be.
[time=348] So there you have it, an amazing look at this year's 2006 Leadership Summit.

[time=895] (Music) (Music) (Music) Not loving them, not caring for them, but exasperating them. Sometimes we steal from an employer.
[time=913] Sometimes we withhold love and affection from a spouse for selfish, self-serving reasons.
[time=921] Sometimes we lie.
[time=925] Sometimes we covet. Sometimes we complain about church leaders. Sometimes we don't serve others in need.
[time=933] Sometimes we create and live in fantasy worlds.
[time=937] Never do that.
[time=941] Never get behind the wheel of the car and have a 20 minute ride and just start to manufacture and fabricate some fantasy world that you insert yourself into because you're just so tired of yours.
[time=953] Sometimes.
[time=957] Sometimes I miss anybody.
[time=965] And when you add up all the sometimes a lot of times we sin.
[time=973] Don't we?
[time=977] We sin.
[time=981] We, you, and me. A lot of times we sin.
[time=989] Is it a big deal?
[time=993] Well, let's play that out a little bit further. Let's just kind of go with what might typically happen in your life or mine.
[time=997] Many of you in the room, you know the Lord and you're in a relationship with Him and you sin. So what do we do? What usually happens next?
[time=1005] Well, what usually happens next? And next might be in that next moment. Next might be in the next hour. Next might be the next day or the next week. But at some point we would typically come back to this great truth of 1 John 1 9. Most of you in the room can recite it. It's very true and it's very real and many of us are so very thankful for its truth. It says if we confess our what? Say it. Our sins. If we confess our sins, He is faithful. God is.
[time=1037] He is faithful and righteous. Some nations say just. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and not just to forgive us our sins, but He is faithful and just to cleanse us. To literally wipe us and wash us clean.
[time=1061] Good as new. Bright and shiny and pure.
[time=1065] He is God is faithful and just. To forgive you and cleanse you and me from all unrighteousness when you are willing to confess your sins.
[time=1077] So you and I we do what? We confess.
[time=1081] And off we go to the next hour or the next afternoon or that next period of time when we will choose or do whatever it is we will choose or do.
[time=1097] And sometimes we sin.
[time=1101] Well let me read this to you.
[time=1105] Speaking of sin.
[time=1109] Joshua 6 back to the book of Joshua back to this study that we find ourselves in the midst of and let me if I can direct your attention this morning to Joshua chapter 6 verse 15.
[time=1121] Joshua chapter 6 verse 15.
[time=1125] God has given Joshua and God has given the people of Israel some direction here on how they are going to conquer and take this mighty fortress of a city called Jericho. And it was quite an interesting quite a unique battle plan. It involved marching around the city and they were to do that for the first six days and now look at verse 15 it says then on the seventh day they rose early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same manner seven times only on that day they marched around the city seven times at the seventh verse 16 at the seventh time when the priests blew the trumpets Joshua said to the people shout for the Lord has given you the city the city shall be under the ban is how it's translated here this is a special order by God in essence with some specific regulations he says the city shall be under the ban it the city Jericho and all that is in it belongs to the Lord only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in the house shall live because she hid the messengers whom we sent but as for you God now speaking to the people of Israel through Joshua but as for you only keep yourselves from the things under the ban I'm not asking you to do ten things here I'm not giving you a list of stuff this isn't confusing I'll make it really simple and really clear keep yourselves away from those things under the ban so that you don't covet them and take some of the things under the ban and make the camp of Israel accursed and being trouble on it but all the silver and gold and articles
[time=1239] of bronze and iron are holy to the Lord set apart to the Lord they shall go into the treasury of the Lord pretty clear seven times shout walls are going to go down you go in do not take touch covet bring to yourself the things under the ban go to 7-1
[time=1273] 7-1 but the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully
[time=1279] in regard to the things under the ban for Aiken the son of Carmi the son of Zabdi from the tribe of Judah took some of the things under the ban therefore the anger of the Lord burned against the sons of Israel so this takes place Joshua has no idea this is taking place Aiken does this in in secret soon following 7-1 in between 7-1 and 7-10 we see that Joshua sends just a spattering of soldiers they're going to take the city called I A I and as they go to take the city I a completely outmanned outnumbered situation where Israel would have just walked all over them Joshua realizing how outnumbered the soldiers at the city of I would be only sends just a spattering of soldiers up from the house of Israel and I and its soldiers absolutely clean their clocks Israel is defeated after this enormous victory at Jericho they go up against a nobody and the nobody wins and now Joshua is just destroyed he's absolutely at his wits end can't figure out what's happened so on his face so the Lord said to Joshua verse 10 7-10 so the Lord said to Joshua rise up why is it that you have fallen on your face Israel has sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them and they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived moreover they have also put them among their own things so Joshua goes to work he begins to figure this thing out look at verse 19 chapter 7 finds out its Aiken then Joshua said to Aiken my son they bring him in there's Aiken there's Joshua and Joshua said to Aiken my son I implore you
[time=1405] give glory to the Lord the God of Israel and give praise to him and tell me now what you have done do not hide it from me verse 20 so Aiken answered Joshua and said truly I have sinned against the Lord the God of Israel and this is what I did when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinaar and 200 shekels of silver and a bar of gold 50 shekels in wait then I coveted them translation I wanted them and I what?
[time=1441] took them you ever want something?
[time=1449] ask again hello you ever want something
[time=1457] that you weren't supposed to have I'll take hands on that one you ever want something that you weren't supposed to have and then did you ever take it could be a lot of different things so everybody in the room understands Aiken huh?
[time=1481] he took it and I coveted them and took them and behold they are
[time=1495] concealed in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath it
[time=1501] so Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent and behold it was concealed in his tent with the silver underneath it and they took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel and they poured them out before the Lord then Joshua and all of Israel with him you see it there? then Joshua and all of Israel with him took Aiken the son of Zara the silver the mantle the bar of gold his sons his daughters his oxen his donkeys his sheep his tent and all that belonged to him and they brought them up to the valley of acor verse 25 Joshua said why have you troubled us the Lord will trouble you this day and all of Israel stoned them with stones and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones and they raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day and the Lord and the Lord not Joshua and the people of Israel and they carried out that which God had delivered and the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger therefore the name of that place has been called the valley of Acor to this day for over 20 years at different times along the way I've been reading that passage and for over 20 years I have struggled to be very honest end up front with each and every one of you this morning no matter how many times I've read it or how much perspective I've tried to bring to it there have been so many times where I have read through that passage that I just read to you and to me in my own mind to me in my own humanness I guess there have just been times where it has just seemed harsh sons, daughters, family, animals, tent, they've just been some times where I've read through that I just thought to myself my goodness that just seems too severe times were eyes I've read it I've just thought to myself my goodness God you just you just went over the top on this guy like God just popped the divine gasket and I just read it and I go there's times I read it and I just don't I just don't get it and here's what I say here's what I say I don't know it's just me okay it doesn't have to be you this is what I say sometimes to myself when I read that it was just a few coins it's just some coins it's just some gold and silver and they were bad people who we took them from and then you know in the last week something happened and I can't tell you all the details but I'll tell you what in such a powerful way I feel like the great truth of this passage that we just read kind of came to me in such a a clear and powerful way I just I didn't expect it but I'm so thankful that it came here's what here's what happened I was reading the passage I was I was I was sitting down one night and I was reading through the passage with someone else we'll just say someone someone younger than me someone who's not as smart as I am someone who doesn't have as many degrees as I do somebody who's never passed or to church somebody who's I've never been in all the situations that I've been in somebody who hasn't read all the books that I've read dug into the issues that I've dug into so we're reading through this passage about me and this younger person and as we read through it we come to that very difficult part there where the judgment against Aiken is delivered and I'm in my mind I'm thinking oh gee see here's how this is going to go see and we're going to get done with this and I'm going to have to explain this and I'm not going to know how to explain this because God I don't get it after 20 years I still don't quite get it and so we get done reading and this younger person just sits there and just looks at the Bible and kind of looks at me and looks at the Bible and first I think just said whoa look back down at the Bible and look back at me and said to me in such a clear and profound way so this younger person said so to God sin must be a really big deal and I just I just sat there and thought to myself my goodness I mean maybe I've thought it but I don't know that I've ever said it that way I don't know that I've ever read through that and in my mind or heart come to the simple and profound conclusion that you know what disobedience is a really big deal and God has always and still does I believe take it very very seriously and I would submit to you all this morning that that statement is true that to God sin must be a really big deal small or large gossip or murder over eating or over drinking aikens yours and mine a very very big deal and as I've thought about it in the kind of just the recent days some thoughts and some I hope you know some truths have kind of resurfaced in my own heart and life I've written a few of them down these first few might just be a little random so bear with me but there's a few things I want to just give you before you go to think about as it relates to your sin and mine. As I think through this story of Aiken as I think through this idea that sin really is a big deal to God one of the things that popped up immediately the more I thought about it was that we have grown so expectant of grace and mercy grace and mercy offered us by God freely something we're very thankful for and something I'm sure of I'm sure that he has intended that I'm sure of the fact that that's part of his revealed will that he is ready at any time to offer you and I the forgiveness and the cleansing from all unrighteousness that first John 1 9 talked about but see the thing is not on his side but on our side we've kind of grown to expect that we've become so accustomed to it
[time=1955] and I'll say that I'll say I have I've become so accustomed and so expectant of grace and mercy I feel like sometimes I have got a diminished view of sin because I'm so expectant of grace we sang it this morning your grace is enough you know what it is and it is a great truth this truth about grace sometimes I feel like we've become one sided in our view of sin and grace oftentimes you and I sin we've already concluded that how many times a day what do you think?
[time=2003] Bunch Bunch and maybe it's lunch or maybe it's dinner you know maybe it's late at night there you and I sit sincerely genuinely oh God please forgive me oh God that's not who I want to be oh God please wipe my heart clean again give me a fresh start tomorrow with new mercies and as genuine as that can be and as real as his forgiveness is and as real as the new mercies are somehow we just kind of keep rolling down that road and then rolling down that road I think sometimes our view of sin the act itself whatever it might be gets diminished here's something else that comes to mind and you know what this is a biggie this a biggie for me I think this might be a biggie for a bunch of you in the room you know what no matter how old you are no matter what stage of life you're in I think it should be a biggie for everybody because the next thing that kind of comes tumbling into my mind is I think through the implications of this are I think about my kids and here's why I think about my kids because I'll tell you what in my opinion as I read this and in my opinion as I think this through the gold and the silver under the band that God said do not
[time=2085] take it this one thing I say remember don't take the gold leave it alone I don't think that's any different at all then hey Jake come here buddy it's time to go
[time=2107] don't take the gold under the band aiken people of Israel Old Testament thousands of years ago Jericho aftermath of the walls coming down camp an intense 2006 you and I five-year-olds please share the toy why? because I asked you to and I'm got no and I'm your and I'm your and I'm your mother or I'm your father or I'm a teacher I'm an authority in your life and here's how this works when the authority asks you to do something aiken in the gold Jake and the cookie whatever it might be you see did you get my point we're teaching them my friends we're modeling for them we're preparing them to be obedient teenagers and young men and young women and future fathers and mothers or we're allowing them to be manipulators and negotiators and disobedient disrespectful young men are young women moms and future dads who ignore the band and take whatever they want to take and so I just would plead with you the obedience thing and I don't mean obedience the eighth time you ask I mean the obedience thing the first time you ask aiken didn't get eight chances did he and when God calls you or me to do something he calls you and I to do it when now huge implications on the parenting front right this down four things why should you view your sin as such a big deal why should we view our sin why should I view my sin as such a big deal number one please write this down it is so true scripture speaks of this again and again and again my friends sin it offend the thought of it much less the act of it it offends his character the character of God we serve and and have the privilege of living in relationship with an amazing God Isaiah 6 2 and 3 Revelation 4 8 write those down it says in this Isaiah 6 2 Sarah from stood above him each having six wings with two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet and with two he flew this angelic amazing being there in the presence of God and one called out to the other and said holy set apart holy perfect holy pure holy holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory Revelation 4 8 write that down look at it later Revelation 4 8 and the four living creatures each one of them having six wings are full of eyes important there full of eyes around and within they see everything they have eyes all over looking out observing taking in and what do they see what do they conclude what do they look at and day and night they do not cease to say holy holy holy is the Lord God the Almighty who was and who is and is to come my friends he is a holy God pure pure as pure can be pure as pure can be and your sin or my sin it offends and you know what it should don't not God in your mind for being offended by your sin he is a holy righteous God kebroni kebroni years ago the kids were a lot smaller we had some friends good friends still love them to this day but and they're not in town and they don't even live here so they'll never hear this so don't say anything to anybody just keep this between us but now it's all right friends different place and they had this house and the house was white I mean white I mean the carpet was white and the linoleum was white and the walls were white and the kitchen table was white I mean it was white you get my picture this house was white everything was white and not only was the whole house white but it was full of white antiques and it was full of white keepsakes and it was like it was like a museum I didn't even like going in there it was just amazingly clean and pristine and nice and sharp and white and expensive and it took us about two times going over there and we kind of looked at each other in the car going home that last time after a couple of near disasters and we just you know I just you know we're not going back there again somehow some way I will figure out a way to never go back in that house with those kids because you just don't do that it just it offends it offends the nature of that house you don't you don't send a three-year-old with putting into into a place like that you just don't do it something that pristine and something that white and something that pure you just don't do it sin offends his character write this down number two it violates his design it violates his design that's right the design that he originally had for the life that you and I were to live with him look it back to Genesis 3 8 we looked at this a couple months ago Adam and Eve they're hiding from God the the whole sin thing has happened and they heard the sound remember they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and the man and the wife and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden and here it is verse 9 then the Lord God called to the man and said to him where are you and verse 10 the man said I heard the sound of you remember that Adam and Eve they were so familiar with him he had obviously come and walked with them and I mean like walked with them in the cool of the day they were so familiar what it sounded like when the presence of God was coming to be with them and to walk with them he heard the sound that which he was familiar with relationship with God intimacy in the garden that was what he designed he made us he wired us my friends for intimacy the cool of the day walks in the garden with him and sin separates your sin my sin it's separate it violates his design it defiles thirdly right this down it defiles his relationship it distances his relationship with us that's what sin did think about it just for a moment think about Jesus on the cross just for a moment think about Jesus on the cross as Jesus hangs there on the cross bearing all of your what say it louder sin there's Jesus on the cross bearing all of our sin and when all of the sin of all of the people of all time past present and future gets placed directly and squarely on him when sin is present there in the sun in total he looks to the skies and says father father why have you what why have you turned why have you forsaken see God see it it defiles the relate God cannot look upon God cannot beat God isn't with God cannot come up close to sin it defiles the relationship sin we sin don't we one last thought it diminishes I believe this to be true it diminishes our viability what do I mean by that well here's what I mean how viable and I'll just talk about me not you how viable is my witness my testimony to others of God at work in me how viable how legitimate how effective how powerful is my testimony to others of God's work in me if I stand and say I'm a fully surrendered follower of Christ and that they should fully surrender their hearts and lives to him because when you do you experience the grace and the and the mercy of God and the power and the capacity because of God to fight sin because when you're in relationship with him you get to end that relationship live a life that is distinctively different how do I how do I do that say all that and then cheat on my spouse my government or employer gossip with a friend about a friend over spend my family into debt criticizing complain about church leaders lie about my expenses etc etc etc and they stand there and look at you or me and go what's the deal I'm going to sign up for that now you and I know as those words come out of my mouth I know there's a flip side to that I know that I can't be perfect and I got to stand up and I got to say I'm a fully surrendered follower of Christ and then the moment I do that then they're going to look at my life and you're going to look at my life and the truth of the matter is when you look at my life or they look at my life we sin don't we and I think follow me here I think what allows the testimony to be viable and legit isn't that somehow I would never sin it's not my point this morning how serious do I take it and how willing am I with an on looking world to be honest and authentic in the admittance of my sin and my need and my gratitude for a savior whose love and forgiveness is real it's a big deal my friends I'm going to ask the band to come on up and I'm going to ask all of you to just sit tight we've got some time and I would love for you as a family to respond to this message from your hearts this morning please just sit tight and listen to this maybe just close your eyes for a moment would you maybe just bow your heads just listen my friends it's a big deal and here's what I want to leave you with this morning and left unaddressed or unconfessed think about this whatever it is left unaddressed or unconfessed it hardens your heart it distances you from him if you don't confess it if you don't between you and God bring it out in the open between you and him and say you know what here it is I know I know that it violates you I know that it's an offense to your character I know that it's not what you designed for us I know that it distances our relationship and I know that it affects my opportunity to share you with others and so God I confess it to you today and I want to just remind you this morning whoever you are that if you do that if you first John 1 9 if you confess that he is faithful today and tomorrow and next week and next month he doesn't view it as you being presumptuous he just simply loves you that much that he's going to forgive you again and again and again but I hope and I pray that today you would give some thought to the way you view that a little jake comes to me every week almost his dad I want to touch the rim I had a hoop out in our driveway 10 feet his dad I want to touch the rim well it's like if you came to me and said you know what this week I don't want to sin what if I said to everybody here hey everybody this week let's not sin let's just take this thing really serious and let's not sin this week well you know what about a thousand of you are going to automatically think well that's impossible I'm human I'm going to sin see we so quickly go there but see every week I tell Jake go outside and jump I want to touch the rim go you'll get it one of these days is he going to touch it tomorrow no please try him God says work out your salvation with fear and trembling I know your salvation and your sanctification is about him and his work in you it's also about your choices and mine and so maybe this week we could just come at that a little differently he is faithful amen would you please sing about that and would you please this morning respond to that the faithfulness of a God who has saved you and continues to forgive you amen let's stand
