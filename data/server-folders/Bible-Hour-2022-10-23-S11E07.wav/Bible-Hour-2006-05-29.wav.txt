[time=30] Now $100,000 I have $80 on the man sipping his coffee in his pajamas, thank you sir, now
[time=51] $90,000, $80,000 would have been $90,000, $80,000.
[time=56] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[time=64] I'm not really auctioning a collector car, but I do have an opportunity for you.
[time=69] Saturday, June 17th, we're having a classic car show here at Blackhawk Ministries, we have all kinds of beautiful cars, it's 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., anybody can come, it's free, there'll be antiques, classics, cars from the 50s and 60s, muscle cars, and fun for
[time=85] the entire family, there'll be food, there'll be things for your children to do, so please come join us, we're going to have a great time.
[time=92] You know we're doing it for a couple reasons, and first is that every car has a design,
[time=99] and that's evidence that behind that design was a designer, and it's the same thing for our lives, it's true for who we are.
[time=106] We each have a unique design, and that's evidence and indicative that we have a designer, and
[time=112] that's God.
[time=113] And the second thing is, you know, I travel all over the world selling collector cars, and what really added value to a car, where it really received its value was its story,
[time=125] and it's the same thing for us.
[time=126] Our story, our relationship with God, are the collection of events that make up our lives,
[time=132] that's what adds value to who we are, and so it's the same thing with cars, and so come join us and let that be kind of a platform for you to enjoy the day, and have a great time with us Saturday, June 17, 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. right here on our campus at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=147] Our car show comes to you about 100 cars, and Jesus came up and spoke to them saying,
[time=160] "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth, therefore go and make disciples
[time=171] of all of them, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit."
[time=185] Teaching them to observe all I have to command you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=191] the end of the age.
[time=196] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=224] It's the sweet, sweet, sweet presence of Jesus, how it moves by the soul, how it makes me
[time=237] whole, how it makes me whole, how it sets me free, brings me liberty, takes me to a higher
[time=260] place, where there's amazing grace, takes me to a higher place, where I can see his face.
[time=276] Here's the sweet, sweet, sweet presence of Jesus, how it moves by the soul, how it moves
[time=289] by the soul, how it makes me whole, how it makes me whole, how it makes me whole.
[time=313] Here's the sweet, sweet, sweet presence of Jesus, how it makes me whole, how it makes
[time=338] me whole, how it makes me whole, how it makes me whole, how it makes me whole, how it makes
[time=490] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC] Hi, my name is Sam Barfell.
[time=512] And I have the privilege of serving as the Superintendent of Black Hawk Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=516] And Black Hawk Christian School has been in existence for just over 30 years.
[time=520] And I'd like to take this opportunity just to share some of the exciting things about what we get to do as a Christian school.
[time=526] First of all, we use a line around here that goes like this.
[time=530] We believe Black Hawk Christian School provides academic excellence on a biblical foundation.
[time=534] And there are two parts to that. The academic excellence is something that we pursue hard and we have a rigorous curriculum that we challenge our students to give their very best and be the very best student that God's called them to be.
[time=546] But the other part of that is the biblical foundation. Everything that we teach comes from the truth of Scripture and the premise of everything we teach comes from that scriptural base. And that is what we call teaching truth.
[time=560] And then the other thing I'd like to tell you about is our faculty.
[time=562] We just have an incredible team of people who make up the teachers and the faculty of the staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=570] And these people have given their professional lives and their ministry lives to serving the students that God has by his sovereignty placed right here in our school to provide that academic excellence on a biblical foundation. And it is my pleasure to work next and alongside those who are the faculty and staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=590] They are second to none. I'm convinced of that. And I would like to just encourage you and challenge you during these summer months as you're thinking about next fall on school starting up again to think about and explore the possibility of your child, your students becoming part of the family here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=606] And I would challenge you to give us a call and let us give you what we call a tour and a talk. Walk through our facilities so you can catch kind of a heart glimpse of what we're about and what we're trying to accomplish and how we're trying to partner with parents who want their children to walk in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ. And how that communication are just seamlessly welded together in such a powerful way. And so I invite you to give us a call get on our website and contact us and let us give you some more information about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=656] [APPLAUSE]
[time=660] Excuse me just a second.
[time=668] I'm sorry. I was trying to get Dean to come up and do it for me but I thought that would be too hokey.
[time=676] We're going to do a song that was written in 1820 by Fanny Crosby.
[time=680] It's an old hymn. And I'm from a background that we didn't do a lot of hymns because we didn't do hymns watching TV on Sunday mornings back when I was a kid. But I've only recently become aware of a lot of these old hymns above those big words like rock and anchor and hope and all of those things that really have meaning. They're not esoteric words but they sing deeply.
[time=712] And so I really appreciate it coming into the knowledge of all of these hymns. And this one is to God be the glory.
[time=720] And you guys have done it probably thousands of times. And I just ask you to sing it with a new energy and a new level of understanding. And well, let's just give it a shot.
[time=742] Here we go.
[time=772] Oh come to the Father through Jesus the Son.
[time=784] And give him that glory great things he has done.
[time=790] Oh perfect redemption.
[time=794] The purchase of blood to every believer.
[time=798] The promise of God. The Thighless defender who truly believes. And woman from Jesus apart and receives.
[time=810] Great things. Great things he has done. And great are rejoicing through Jesus the Son. But pure and higher and greater will be. Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see.
[time=830] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=834] Let the earth hear his voice.
[time=838] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=842] Let the people rejoice.
[time=846] Oh come to the Father through Jesus the Son.
[time=850] And give him that glory great things he has done.
[time=854] Glory great things he has done.
[time=858] Okay, let's sing some glory now. Here we go. Quietly.
[time=862] Glory, glory, glory, glory.
[time=866] Give him glory great things he has done.
[time=870] Glory, glory, glory, glory.
[time=874] Give him glory great things he has done. Do it again.
[time=878] Glory, glory, glory, glory.
[time=882] Glory great things he has done.
[time=886] Glory, glory, glory, glory.
[time=890] Give him glory great things he has done.
[time=894] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=898] Let the earth hear his voice.
[time=902] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=906] Let the people rejoice.
[time=910] Glory, glory, glory.
[time=914] Oh come to the Father through Jesus the Son.
[time=918] And give him that glory great things he has done.
[time=922] Okay, now it's your turn. Put you in charge.
[time=926] Don't let me down. Don't let God down.
[time=930] It's not about me, it's about God. I'm sorry. Okay.
[time=934] I'm gonna have you sing. We're not gonna sing into our mics. I just want to hear your voices Okay, I'm gonna try to lead into a right first service I didn't. Everybody looked at each other like what's going on.
[time=946] Okay, here we go.
[time=950] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=954] Let the earth hear his voice.
[time=958] Praise the Lord, sing it out.
[time=962] Let the people rejoice.
[time=966] Okay, that was alright. That was okay.
[time=970] Hold it, that was okay. We're gonna try it again. This time dig way down deep.
[time=974] Find that little pot of joy way down there and put it into your vocal cords and let it come out the top. Okay, here we go. One, two.
[time=982] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=986] Let the earth hear his voice.
[time=990] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=994] Let the people rejoice.
[time=998] Praise the Lord, let the people rejoice.
[time=1022] Fanny Crosby didn't write that in 6-8, Corb.
[time=1026] And you two were flying.
[time=1030] That arrangement had their hands moving really.
[time=1034] It was so much fun to watch them. They were sort of competing with each other and trying to see who could do it real fast.
[time=1042] Well, that was fun. Well, yesterday, Nancy and I drove over to Ohio and picked up my mom and went out to the cemetery.
[time=1054] Mom really likes to visit Dad's grave and just to see if the flowers are blooming and the weeds are away and all that stuff. She knows he's not there, but it's a good place to visit. I like to go to.
[time=1070] I like to remember things about him and talk with Mom about that.
[time=1078] And I don't think I've ever told you this.
[time=1082] One of the greatest things Nancy ever did for me was she went out to the cemetery with me to look at Renee's grave.
[time=1090] And Renee was my first wife for those of you that don't know that.
[time=1094] And we were standing there. My name's on that tombstone. I did that for a lot of reasons, but for the first time Nancy kind of realized that there's a plot there for me and Nancy and Renee is there and Nancy will stand there thinking, "Where's she going to be?" And we had a neat discussion about that.
[time=1114] We've had a lot of fun talking about heaven and what that's going to be like and even Renee and Nancy getting to meet each other and the stuff that's going to bring. I don't want them to compare notes, that's for sure.
[time=1130] But made Nancy feel a little bit uncomfortable.
[time=1134] And on the way home, we were trying to think through, I checked out to see if I could buy the plot next to the one that I have now and it was taken.
[time=1142] And later she said, "You know I've got this all figured out." I said, "What is it?" She said, "I'm just going to be cremated and they can put me in your pocket." That's been her sweet spirit about things like that ever since I met her.
[time=1158] Memorial Day brings memories like that. You think about people that have died.
[time=1162] And I looked around that cemetery and there were flags all over that cemetery representing people that had served in different of our armed services. And I'm thankful for that.
[time=1174] And you know it's customary at our church. We're going to acknowledge you here. I want you people that have served in the military. And I want to add a couple things this year.
[time=1182] If you've served as a fireman or a police officer of any kind, legal law enforcement at any level, I'd like for you to stand to. So fireman and police officers, anybody that's been serving in the military service, would you please stand so we can thank you for what you've done.
[time=1220] Memorial Day is a great day for this message.
[time=1228] I don't know if you noticed, but there were a lot of remembering songs there.
[time=1232] Corbin did a great job of putting those songs together.
[time=1236] And it's really healthy to remember.
[time=1244] And you know it can be an unhealthy thing to remember and cling to the past and have the past be who you become.
[time=1256] There are some people that had an event take place in their life and they live out that event in life the rest of their life.
[time=1264] They can be a good one or a bad one when they do that. That's not a good thing.
[time=1268] It's good to remember the past, but it's also really good to think about how it impacts the present and how it should impact the present and the future. Well, in Joshua 8, there's an event that takes place and it culminates in a remembering time. And we're going to enjoy that today as we look at it.
[time=1288] Let's pray together.
[time=1292] Our Father in Heaven, I am so thankful.
[time=1300] I'm thankful. I can remember really good things about the lives that have gone on to be with you about soldiers and seamen and Marines and Air Force personnel and police officers and firemen. I'm so grateful for the people that have been willing to serve in those capacities.
[time=1328] I'm thankful I can remember my own dad and my grandparents even though I never knew them, but I can remember what I've been told.
[time=1344] Most of all, Lord, those things just dim and such insignificance to us remembering the works of your hand. And today we want to focus our attention on that. And I pray that everything you learn today would help us become the people that you've designed us to be, that we would bring you glory.
[time=1368] [AMEN] Well, this book of Joshua is a great book named after the person who's the prominent figure in the book.
[time=1384] He may have written some of it, not sure who wrote Joshua.
[time=1388] It definitely was contemporary. Somebody was there.
[time=1392] They say we a lot.
[time=1396] The name Joshua is a significant one. And in number chapter 12, when Moses sent the spies out to check out the promised land, he changed Hosea's name to Yeshua.
[time=1420] And this is Joshua, the Greek form of it.
[time=1428] Hosea means salvation. When he changed his name, he changed his name to Yahweh and that is salvation. Pretty significant thing to remember.
[time=1448] So significant that God decided to give a guy that name through Moses. And so we have this Joshua Yahweh is salvation as a book and represented in this leader that leads the children of Israel to conquer the promised land.
[time=1468] And let's review for a minute. Remember, they were obedient and took Jericho the way God instructed them to take Jericho marching around the city seven times. Trumpets, shouting, walls tumbling down. But remember too Aiken then took some of the plunder. God said when you destroy Jericho, kill everything there and take nothing from that city. But Aiken, as we learned a couple weeks ago, took some of the plunder, hit it, and cost Israel, including himself. Remember two weeks ago Kelly taught us that God said Israel has sinned against me when Aiken sinned. And you know, I know something about that. There are times that we've done something. People do something wrong. And it's not just their guilt, but their guilt gets passed on to family members. People say they might even know their name, but they might know their last name and say that family's one of those blank families. Sometimes I had this happen in the school often. Students would do something wrong outside the school.
[time=1544] People wouldn't know the names of those students, but they knew they were students from Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1548] You get a bad name sometimes when people that are from within do something bad outside. It happens to churches too, and pastors or prominent leaders fall. The church gets a bad mark.
[time=1568] It's a common thing, but this is a lot bigger deal here.
[time=1572] Aiken and his whole family and all of his possessions suffered death because of Aiken's sin.
[time=1584] So at the end of that chapter in chapter 7, says all Israel stoned Aiken and over Aiken they heaped a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day.
[time=1592] Then the Lord turned from his fierce anger, it says.
[time=1600] Therefore that place has been called the valley of Aikor ever since. That means trouble.
[time=1608] God says turned from his fierce anger. Good.
[time=1616] If I'm Joshua, that's good news. And so then chapter 8, I've divided up into three sections, and the first section is God's plan received. That's verses 1 and 2.
[time=1628] The second section is God's plan enacted. That's verses 3 through 29. And the third section is God honored verses 33-35.
[time=1640] 1 verses 1 and 2. God's plan received.
[time=1644] Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged.
[time=1652] Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged." He's heard that before.
[time=1656] He heard it in Deuteronomy when Moses passed on the mantle of leadership in Joshua. He used that exact phrase.
[time=1668] Let me read it to you. You don't need to turn back there. It's just a couple verses.
[time=1672] Deuteronomy 31, verses 7 and 8.
[time=1676] It says, "Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous. Where you must go with this people into the land that the Lord swore to their forefathers to give them. And you must divided among them into their inheritance. The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you. He will never leave you nor forsake you." Then that phrase comes up. That sentence. "Do not be afraid.
[time=1704] Do not be discouraged." Folks, if people tell you, if they say to you, let me tell you ahead of time, before events take place, don't be afraid. Don't be discouraged.
[time=1720] You're going to go, "Ooh, I can't wait for this deal." Moses says, "Get ready. Don't be afraid.
[time=1728] Don't be discouraged." And the Y precedes that. It says, "Because the Lord, it's the Lord who's going to deliver.
[time=1736] It's the Lord who's going to prevail. It's the Lord who's going to be victorious." The circumstances may seem scary.
[time=1744] The circumstances may be really hard.
[time=1748] Don't be afraid. Don't get discouraged.
[time=1752] You know, some of you have been through some really, really hard discouraging circumstances. Some scary ones.
[time=1760] Some of you are going through some really hard and scary circumstances.
[time=1772] And all of us are going to face some.
[time=1776] The end of our life on this Earth is a discouraging, fearful kind of event from man's perspective. But in Christ, I can claim the reality that God goes before me and I don't have to be afraid and I don't have to be discouraged.
[time=1800] Joshua's told that by Moses. Then God tells Joshua the same thing over in chapter 1, verse 9.
[time=1808] In chapter 1, God says to him three times, remember?
[time=1812] That would have made me want to run right then. He had to say it three times.
[time=1816] Be strong and courageous. One of the times he says, "Be very strong and very courageous." But in Joshua 1.9 he says, "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous.
[time=1832] Be terrified. Do not be afraid.
[time=1836] Be courageous. Don't be discouraged. Be courageous.
[time=1840] For the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go." Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged.
[time=1852] Take the whole army with you and go up and attack AI.
[time=1856] AI had defeated them once.
[time=1860] For I have delivered into your hands the king of AI his people, his city, and his land." Past tense.
[time=1868] Check that out.
[time=1872] I've already done it. Now don't you be afraid and discouraged?
[time=1876] You simply do what I tell you to do and what I've already done will come to fruition.
[time=1884] I've delivered past tense into your hands the king of AI his people, his city, and his land.
[time=1892] You shall do to AI and its king as you did to Jericho and its king.
[time=1896] Except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city. That's what God commands.
[time=1908] Now for some of you, this verse may be the reason you're in church this morning.
[time=1916] I just want you to think about the reality of what he's saying here in this verse. He says, "This time you can carry the plunder away. In my timing when I want you to have what you want you can have it. I didn't want you to have it when you took Jericho.
[time=1936] I didn't want you to have what you wanted.
[time=1940] I wanted you to learn something there. And Aiken took what he wanted instead of what God gave.
[time=1948] But now isn't this ironic?
[time=1952] The next campaign, if Aiken had waited, the plunder's theirs.
[time=1964] You have to be careful grabbing principles out of the Old Testament that are conditional statements but I think this one's pretty safe. This is pretty clear in the New Testament as well.
[time=1972] In Matthew chapter 6, God in that chapter.
[time=1976] Jesus teaches a sermon on the Mount. In chapter 6, he starts out and he says to them, first of all, give to the needy. That's my plan. Give to the needy.
[time=1984] Then there's a whole section on prayer. He says pray.
[time=1988] Then there's a section on fasting. He says fast. So give to the needy.
[time=1992] He says pray fast. Then he says, store up treasures in heaven, not on earth.
[time=2000] And then after that section he says, and I'll give you everything you need.
[time=2008] You don't have to worry about anything. I will give you clothing and shelter and food and always, always, always meet your needs. You do not have to worry about your needs being met.
[time=2024] God always provides what I need.
[time=2030] And sometimes, AI, what I want, the key for me is to remember who's to be obedient and who provides.
[time=2050] I'm not the provider. God is my provider.
[time=2056] I'm the obedient one looking for the opportunities to live life his way. Give to the needy, pray, fast, store up treasures in heaven.
[time=2068] And he says I'll provide everything you need.
[time=2072] He can want to provide what he wanted for himself.
[time=2076] And God says to Joshua, now you can have what you want.
[time=2086] You know, I just think it's so important to remember.
[time=2090] Remember that he's provided what you've needed.
[time=2094] We get in trouble financially.
[time=2098] But when we go beyond what we need and we extend ourselves out there for what we want before he provides it.
[time=2110] I'm not kidding. We've had some of the most extravagant vacations you can imagine and not paid for them because people took us on vacation.
[time=2122] I believe sometimes God just said I think they need one here. Let's just get them this one.
[time=2130] They need what they want. I'll give it to him. Sometimes he doesn't.
[time=2134] God has a plan for you.
[time=2142] He has a plan for your life.
[time=2146] I'm not talking about every step you're going to make because you have some choice in that matter.
[time=2154] And when you God has already delivered you, that's his plan.
[time=2162] And some of you just maybe haven't realized that he's delivered you already.
[time=2170] Verse 3 through 29.
[time=2178] God's plan enacted.
[time=2182] Now this is a lengthy passage and we're going to go through this because the history is important here.
[time=2186] I'll read it and just interject a few things but we're going to, sometimes in the Bible God gives us really incredible detail, some interesting stuff, some history that we need to learn.
[time=2194] That's what this is. This is fun.
[time=2198] So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack AI. He chose 30,000 of us.
[time=2202] Now remember there were three the other time?
[time=2206] They had their own plan. Remember?
[time=2210] He devised a scheme. Doesn't say God told him what to do there on that first one.
[time=2214] And Aiken did the bad thing but Joshua had his own plan too and they only sent 3,000 because they sent some spies out that God didn't tell him to send out.
[time=2222] He chose 30,000 of his best fighting men and sent them out at night. That'd be an interesting thing wasn't it?
[time=2230] 30,000 people sneaking around at night.
[time=2234] With these orders listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city.
[time=2238] People very far from it. That's interesting. Hide 30,000 people to ambush the city. So I checked out what the geography was like around there because I was really interested in that. There were these huge rocks and all over the place behind AI. You can hide 30,000 people back there. And that's what they did.
[time=2258] They got up close but they hid 30,000 of them. Don't go very far from it and of all of you beyond the alert it says.
[time=2266] And I and all those with me will advance in the city and when the men come out against us as they did before we will flee from them. So they're going to be the 30,000 around to the west. AI is located the southern part of the Jordan just west of the southern most part of the Jordan right before it drops into the Dead Sea. We have AI up there. And around to the west behind it is all this rocky stuff that I was talking about.
[time=2290] And then from the north and the east they could attack as they did before. And then the plan was let's get all of the AI men to come out and attack us like they did the last time when they defeated us. And then we'll have 30,000 in hiding that will come into the city and be able to take it.
[time=2310] Let's see what happens. They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city for they will say they are running away from us as they did before. So when we flee from them you are to rise up from ambush and take the city.
[time=2322] The Lord your God will give it into your hand. When you have taken the city set it on fire do what the Lord has commanded. See to it you have my orders. Then Joshua sent them off and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and AI to the west of AI. But Joshua spent that night with the people.
[time=2342] Early the next morning Joshua mustered his men and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to AI. The entire force that was with them marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of AI with the valley between them and the city. Joshua had taken about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and AI to the west of the city. Now here are three groups there's 30,000 that he sent out behind the city and they're hiding in the rocks then he has a certain number we don't know how many that was but 5,000 of the people that went out with him go between Bethel and AI that was probably because Bethel could have come and given aid to AI and they were prepared in case that happened that's what makes a lot of sense militarily.
[time=2390] They had the soldiers take up their positions all those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley when the king of AI saw this he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah but he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city. Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them and they fled toward the desert.
[time=2418] They pretended they were being defeated and took off back toward the desert. All the men of AI were called to pursue them and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city. Not a man who remained in AI or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel. Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Hold out toward AI the javelin that is in your hand. For into your hand I will deliver the city." So Joshua held out his javelin toward AI.
[time=2450] As soon as he did this the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward they entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire. The men of AI looked back and saw the smoke in the city rising of the city rising in the sky but they had no chance to escape in any direction. For the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the desert had turned back against their pursuers. For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city they turned around and attacked the men of AI. So now they have 30,000 men in town burning it up. Another 5,000 can attack them including attacking the people from Bethel and Joshua and his men. Israel cut them down and says leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.
[time=2498] But they took the king of AI alive and brought him to Joshua. When Israel had finished killing all the men of AI in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them and when every one of them had been put to the sword all the Israelites returned to AI and killed those who were in it. 12,000 men and women fell that day. All the people of AI. For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in AI. You know when I see that it happens a lot here in the book of Joshua this happens a lot and I don't get it.
[time=2538] It seems like a lot of innocent people die.
[time=2542] Until I remember that none of us are innocent. My view of man.
[time=2554] Unregenerate man.
[time=2558] I have a natural tendency to think of unregenerate man as good and I need to be careful.
[time=2566] God has chosen to snatch some of us out of what we deserve by his mercy and grace. They just got what they deserved.
[time=2582] As a matter of fact, a lot of people get what they deserve on this earth and maybe they're going to get more of what they deserve.
[time=2590] That's not easy for me.
[time=2594] You know what? I want God to be this God that everybody else told me he was.
[time=2602] He's just all pure, sweet, love, forgiving, no justice.
[time=2606] I don't want to eat justice.
[time=2610] But the Bible is really clear.
[time=2614] God is just and it's only by mercy and grace that you and I are saved.
[time=2622] We deserve hell.
[time=2626] Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and the plunder of this city.
[time=2634] They got what they wanted in addition to what they needed as the Lord had instructed Joshua. So Joshua burned A.I. and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day. He hung the king of A.I.
[time=2650] on a tree and left him there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take his body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate.
[time=2662] Deuteronomy 21, let me read this to you, explains that. Deuteronomy chapter 21 verses 22 and 23, it says this. If a man, this is a whole list of God's laws. If a man, guilty of a capital offense is put to death and his body is hung on a tree.
[time=2686] You must not leave his body on the tree overnight.
[time=2690] Be sure to bury him that same day because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God's curse. You must not desecrate the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
[time=2706] In order not to desecrate the land, Joshua had the king of A.I. taken down from the tree and buried the same day that he was killed.
[time=2714] Now you know what? I don't know how big a deal that is that he's really buried. The big deal to me is Joshua knew the law so well that he was looking for the opportunities to be obedient to it. Here's an opportunity where you hang a king up on a tree and the Deuteronomy passage says, "Oh, when you hang somebody up on a tree, God curses that and you don't want that to desecrate the land so you take him down before nightfall." I love the fact that Joshua loved the law and knew it. And he then was able to apply it.
[time=2762] He was obedient to it, looking for the opportunities to obey God.
[time=2770] It says a lot about him.
[time=2774] God had a different plan.
[time=2778] He had victory through obedience.
[time=2782] He had victory that followed defeat.
[time=2786] One defeat. Listen to this.
[time=2790] Listen to this. "One defeat does not end your potential usefulness." The nation of Israel had been defeated.
[time=2802] They were still useful. "One defeat you cave in and disobey God.
[time=2810] It does not end the potential for your usefulness in the kingdom." Don't let the enemy mislead you for thinking that because you did this, you can't serve God.
[time=2822] That is a lie. You can serve God. There may be some ways we can't serve God, but there are always other ways that we can.
[time=2830] Well, God's plan was received. God's plan was enacted.
[time=2838] And now they get a chance to honor God.
[time=2842] They're going to remember the works of his hand.
[time=2846] This is a Joshua built on Mount Ebal.
[time=2850] That is north. I'll turn around here. It's north and west. Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim are about in the very center of the Promised Land.
[time=2862] Israel to the north, Judah to the south, later on.
[time=2866] Okay? And these two mountains are really close to each other. This is an incredible location.
[time=2874] And there's a valley between them that serves as a very natural amphitheater. He goes up there because that's where he was supposed to go in the first place to worship God. So he goes to Mount Ebal and he built an altar to the Lord. Listen to this, the God of Israel.
[time=2894] As Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the Israelites.
[time=2898] He did it the way Moses told him to. He built it according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses.
[time=2902] An altar of uncut stones.
[time=2906] I asked Ford a little bit ago, "Why do you think they were uncut stones?" He said, "No human touch to them. Nothing changed them. They're unblemished stones.
[time=2918] They haven't been blemished by man's changing them." And he builds this altar to present sacrifices to God. He wants to worship him because of what God's done.
[time=2930] One if they offered the Lord burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings. There in the presence of the Israelites Joshua copied on stones the law of Moses. Some debate about how much of the law he wrote there.
[time=2946] It may have been the Ten Commandments that were rewritten again. It may have been more than that.
[time=2950] We don't know how much. But he took the time to carve out the law that Moses had received.
[time=2958] Verse 33, "All Israel, aliens, and citizens alike with their elders, officials, and judges were standing on both sides of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, basing those who carried it.
[time=2970] The priests who were Levites. Only the priests could carry the Ark of the Covenant. Only the Levites. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerasim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal. So you've got people partly up the mountain here and you have people partly up the mountain here and Joshua is in the center of this valley amphitheater with them on both sides.
[time=2994] As Moses the servant of the Lord had formally commanded when he gave instructions to
[time=3002] bless the people of Israel. Afterward Joshua read all the words of the law. Can you imagine?
[time=3010] This has been a long passage for me to read this morning. How have you done?
[time=3016] How have you been staying focused on the word of God as it was being read?
[time=3024] He read all the law.
[time=3028] I love it when Nehemiah goes back and rebuilds the wall and Ezra reads the law from 6 in the morning until noon day.
[time=3036] How would you do with that? Would you be excited to hear the law read? You come to church anticipating getting to hear the Bible? Do you think about the words on the songs that we sing and revere God as you sing those things? How are you doing at your part?
[time=3056] They went to the center of the promised land.
[time=3064] They did public worship.
[time=3068] Says he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the curses just as is as written in the book of the law.
[time=3076] There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel including the women and children and the aliens that be me who lived among them.
[time=3088] They went there to honor God.
[time=3094] How are you doing at remembering God and honoring God?
[time=3102] Sometimes, you know, I think that we
[time=3110] ought to make sermons as interesting as we can and I understand all that and I used to tell teachers all the time, make sure that you motivate kids.
[time=3118] Don't talk more than 20 minutes. Make sure they're involved doing something.
[time=3122] But you know what? I also know this. Part of the burden's on you in here with hearts and ears and minds that are ready to receive whatever it is that God has for you.
[time=3134] One of the things I've loved about being in this church is God had something for me from Dave Jeremiah that was different from what he had for me from Rick and it was different.
[time=3146] Russell brought some different stuff to me and Kelly does and Mitchell does and all the Sunday school teachers that I've ever had when I listened to Bill teach me about it on Wednesday, whatever it's been. God's had something unique for me from them at that time. I always wonder about people that jump around follow people.
[time=3162] I don't get it at all. If God brings somebody new in that's going to bring something new to me, I'm anticipating what are the new things that I'm going to get to learn from this person's perspective. I don't get it.
[time=3174] I can listen to lots of sermons on the radio.
[time=3178] I can listen to anybody I like. We've had a few guys here over the years that preached. I really didn't like that much. Not our senior pastor by the way. But I got something really good from every one of them because if you come anticipating what God's going to bring from his word instead of how they're going to entertain you, so I encourage you look for the opportunities to receive the knowledge that God's bringing to you and then look for the opportunities to implement what you've received.
[time=3214] Three things to take home.
[time=3218] That first thing that I talked about there, the name of this book, Yahweh is salvation.
[time=3226] Salvation is not the four spiritual laws.
[time=3230] Salvation is not the Roman road.
[time=3234] Salvation is not contagious Christianity or living proof or lifestyle evangelism or EE.
[time=3242] Those are all really good tools. I've been through all those. They're really good tools. I've used all kinds of things from each of them.
[time=3250] Salvation is God.
[time=3254] Hallelujah. Salvation is God. Yahweh is salvation.
[time=3262] Not some plan. Not your works.
[time=3266] He's already delivered you by his plan. My fear is that some of you don't realize it.
[time=3274] You haven't received the deliverance that he's already provided.
[time=3282] Some of you need to receive the reality of the gift of Christ. He's already delivered you from your sin on the cross. You need to receive it.
[time=3294] Number two.
[time=3298] Yahweh salvation. Number two. Christ fulfills the plan.
[time=3306] God is salvation. The whole plan is fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ in his willingness to obey the Father and get on the cross. Remember what he told Pilate said he had power. He said don't you know who I am?
[time=3322] To Jesus. Like don't you know I could keep I could make a decision that you wouldn't have to go on the cross.
[time=3330] Jesus' response to him was you don't have any power over me that hasn't been given to you by my Father.
[time=3338] I don't have to get on the cross. He could have called as many angels as he wanted. He chose to get on the cross to submit to the Father because he loves us. Because he loves him he wanted to submit to him. Bring him glory. Thirdly Yahweh salvation. Christ fulfills the plan and then this is true. When I've received the gift I now have the opportunity to bring him glory.
[time=3366] I exist for the rest of my days to bring him glory and I want to ask you are you looking for the opportunities to glorify your God? Who is your salvation?
[time=3378] Forever.
[time=3382] Oh I hope you're looking for the opportunities to do that. You just know it shows up in some weird places.
[time=3390] Sometimes you have to give your life up for a wife that doesn't deserve it. Sometimes you have to have a submissive spirit toward a husband that's really hard to submit to.
[time=3402] Sometimes you have to obey parents who aren't doing what's for your best interest.
[time=3410] They don't have your interest at heart. Sometimes you have to yield to a group of people who have authority over you and you have to do it with a good sweet spirit when they're wrong at work.
[time=3422] Are you looking for the opportunities to bring him glory?
[time=3426] You can glorify him that way. You worship him in your obedience in your walk and in your singing.
[time=3434] Yahweh is salvation. Christ fulfills that plan and I exist to bring him glory in response to it.
[time=3446] So do you. I'm going to pray.
[time=3450] There may be somebody in here who has not received the gift of deliverance.
[time=3458] He has already delivered you.
[time=3462] You can pray right now in your seat and tell them that you accept you believe that Christ died for your sins.
[time=3470] You can receive the reality of what's already taken place. He's delivered you.
[time=3478] For others you need to make sure that this week you bring him glory because of the reality of that already taking place in your life. Father in Heaven if there is one person in this room I pray that you would convict their soul that their heart would be drawn to you that they would receive the reality of the gift of salvation that you have already delivered them from Satan and from hell if they'll receive and believe in their heart that Jesus died on the cross for their sins you said they shall be saved. I pray that right now this minute if there's somebody that needs to just pray just believe tell him I believe for those of us that already know you Lord I pray that we would bring you glory.
[time=3530] [AMEN]
