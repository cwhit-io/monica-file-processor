[time=30] Okay, how much you want to bid on a 1957 Chevrolet Belair fuel injected convertible and it's
[time=52] the right color, it's red.
[time=54] How much?
[time=55] You'll give 150,000.
[time=56] 25, thank you, 50, 75.
[time=58] Now $100,000.
[time=59] I have 80 on the man sipping his coffee and his pajamas.
[time=62] Thank you, sir.
[time=63] Now $90,000.
[time=64] $80,000 will have been $90,000.
[time=65] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[time=68] I'm not really auctioning a collector car, but I do have an opportunity for you.
[time=73] Saturday, June 17th, we're having a classic car show here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=78] We'll have all kinds of beautiful cars.
[time=80] It's 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[time=82] Anybody can come.
[time=83] It's free.
[time=84] It'll be antiques, classics, cars from the 50s and 60s, muscle cars.
[time=89] And fun for the entire family, there'll be food, there'll be things for your children to do.
[time=93] So please come join us.
[time=94] We're going to have a great time.
[time=96] You know, we're doing it for a couple reasons.
[time=99] And first is that every car has a design and that's evidence that behind that design
[time=105] was a designer and it's the same thing for our lives.
[time=108] It's true for who we are.
[time=110] We each have our unique design and that's evidence and indicative that we have a designer
[time=116] and that's God.
[time=117] The second thing is, you know, I travel all over the world selling collector cars.
[time=122] And what really added value to a car where it really received its value was its story.
[time=129] And it's the same thing for us.
[time=131] Our story, our relationship with God, are the collection of events that make up our lives.
[time=137] That's what adds value to who we are.
[time=139] And so it's the same thing with cars and so come join us and let that be kind of a platform for you to enjoy the day and have a great time with us Saturday, June 17th, 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[time=150] Right here on our campus at Black Hawk Ministries, our car show comes to you about 100 cars.
[time=155] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=168] and on earth.
[time=174] Therefore go and make disciples of all of us, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[time=180] and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit."
[time=188] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to
[time=195] the end of the age.
[time=201] Helping seekers find and follow Christ."
[time=225] [AMEN]
[time=239] I pray that God hears our voices this morning and that it's a sweet aroma to Him and that it's an offering and a sacrifice of praise and worship.
[time=248] Why don't you have a seat and we are going to continue.
[time=251] I've asked Dave Walters to come and he's going to explain a little bit about this symbol that we've constructed behind me.
[time=258] You notice all the rocks in a pile and we've made an altar this morning to symbolically represent that our sacrifice of praise is being lifted to God together today.
[time=268] Dave's going to come and talk about it some more today and in the next couple of weeks.
[time=272] I just ask that you listen and pray that God speaks to you as Dave shares.
[time=278] Now we're going to take the next three weeks and use this visual image to help us understand
[time=285] God's heart and worship and this morning the one message that I want to really let us
[time=293] really absorb and let simmer is that worship and sacrifice are inseparable.
[time=300] Worship and sacrifice are inseparable and altar's main purpose is to sacrifice.
[time=307] The word altar comes from the word to sacrifice which really means to kill or to slaughter but to take the real Hebrew meaning that it meant for most people that culture 2,000,
[time=319] 3,000, 4, 5,000 years ago it meant the approach.
[time=323] So the altar was the approach and you'd see these all along the road.
[time=328] For instance the first altar that we find is in Genesis 6 after the flood Noah gets out
[time=334] and they build an altar, a memorial.
[time=336] Exodus 2024 says that build your altars out of stone, not cut, just stone like I created
[time=345] them, build your altars for your burnt offerings, your sheep, your goats, your cattle.
[time=352] Where I allow my name to be honored and the new living translation says it where I remind
[time=358] you who I am so in those special moments those notable spiritual experiences that you have
[time=365] with me build an altar, a memorial that you'll always remember what I told you about myself
[time=372] and who I revealed myself to you, those notable spiritual experiences and so you'd have these and a lot of times in the Old Testament you'll see and that altar exists to this day and as you'd walk by someone and say oh the altar, the approach and that approach had two components when we approach God there's two components, there's a worship component that God, the
[time=393] creator of the universe is worthy of worship but the other component is sacrifice, that
[time=400] in order for our worship to be pleasing to him there has to be some acceptable sacrifice
[time=406] because of our sinfulness.
[time=408] Isaiah in Isaiah 6 he sees God and right away his first thought is I'm a man of unclean
[time=415] lips.
[time=416] Peter is out fishing all night, catches nothing, the creator of the universe in the form of Jesus is standing at the seashore, just cast your net on the other side of the boat.
[time=427] It's a full catch, a full net, first thing Peter does he gets on shore is he falls face down at Jesus' feet and said I am a sinful man, get away from me.
[time=438] Without a sacrifice I die in your presence, so a sacrifice.
[time=442] Next week we're going to talk more about a sacrifice but this morning worship and sacrifice
[time=449] are inseparable.
[time=452] Romans 12-1 says this, says therefore brothers I urge you in the view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy I'm pleasing to God, this is your spiritual
[time=464] act of worship.
[time=482] You are the glorious divine, the holiness on high, you are, you are my great redeeming
[time=503] glory, my shield and my reward, you are, you are, you are the glorious divine, the
[time=519] holiness on high, you are, you are my great redeeming glory, my shield and my reward,
[time=537] you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are
[time=641] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=667] You are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, I am, you are, I am.
[time=698] Hallelujah.
[time=703] Lord, I come to you in love, contrition.
[time=722] I wonder, I'm horrible at the splendor of your holiness.
[time=736] I treasure, I cherish the beauty of your holiness.
[time=752] I wonder, I'm horrible at the splendor of your holiness.
[time=772] I treasure, I cherish the beauty of your holiness.
[time=787] You are, Lord, our Lord.
[time=794] You are king of kings.
[time=797] You are mighty God, Lord of everything.
[time=804] You're Emmanuel, for the great I am.
[time=810] You're the Prince of Peace.
[time=813] Who is the land?
[time=817] You're living God, you're not saving great.
[time=824] You will reign forever.
[time=827] You are rich in the day.
[time=830] You are alpha, omega, beginning and end.
[time=836] You're not saying you're the side of Redeemer and men.
[time=842] You're my Prince of Peace and I will live my life.
[time=847] For you, Lord of all.
[time=857] Hi, my name is Sam Barfel and I have the privilege of serving as the superintendent of Black Hawk Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=864] Black Hawk Christian School has been in existence for just over 30 years and I'd like to take this opportunity just to share some of the exciting things about what we get to do as a Christian school.
[time=874] First of all, we use a line around here that goes like this.
[time=878] We believe Black Hawk Christian School provides academic excellence on a biblical foundation and there are two parts to that.
[time=883] The academic excellence is something that we pursue hard and we have a rigorous curriculum that we challenge our students to give their very best and be the very best student that God has called them to be.
[time=894] But the other part of that is the biblical foundation. Everything that we teach comes from the truth of Scripture and the premise of everything we teach comes from that scriptural base.
[time=905] And that is what we call teaching truth.
[time=908] And then the other thing I'd like to tell you about is our faculty.
[time=911] We just have an incredible team of people who make up the teachers and the faculty of the staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=917] And these people have given their professional lives and their ministry lives to serving the students that God has by his sovereignty placed right here in our school to provide that academic excellence on a biblical foundation.
[time=931] And it is my pleasure to work next and alongside those who are the faculty and staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=937] They are second to none. I'm convinced of that.
[time=940] And I would like to just encourage you and challenge you during these summer months as you're thinking about next fall, school starting up again, to think about and explore the possibility of your child, your students becoming part of the family here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=955] And I would challenge you to give us a call and let us give you what we call a tour and a talk.
[time=960] Walk through our facilities so you can catch kind of a heart glimpse of what we're about and what we're trying to accomplish and how we're trying to partner with parents who want their children to walk in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ.
[time=971] And how that and education are just seamlessly welded together in such a powerful way.
[time=978] And so I invite you to give us a call, get on our website and contact us and let us give you some more information about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=988] Hey, when I was 10, when I was 10 years old, one of the biggest things I looked forward to, maybe I was eight.
[time=998] I was eight, just did the math real quick. I was eight years old.
[time=1002] And it was summer, it was the beginning of summer, much like it is today.
[time=1006] And one of the things I was most looking forward to when I was eight was I was going to ride my bike around the block.
[time=1011] I had always been, you know, my mom, only child, a little overprotective, sorry, but I was always just allowed to ride my bike on my street.
[time=1018] But when I turned eight and then that summer they were, I could ride my bike all the way around the block.
[time=1025] And I'll never forget the very first time I finally rode, got to ride my bike around the block.
[time=1030] And you know me, I've told you the story, eight years old, I was about this tall, my head was this big, my ears were this size.
[time=1037] You know, I'll laugh now, it was hard then, but I was quite a sight.
[time=1042] And I remember the very first time I ever rode my bike around the block.
[time=1047] It was a summer day and I came tooling around the corner, all of a sudden I was in new territory.
[time=1052] I'd never been on the other side of the block.
[time=1055] I'm going down this block and all of a sudden it's like an eight year old's worst nightmare.
[time=1060] All of a sudden there were these two junior high boys out in the street riding their bikes.
[time=1066] And to me all of a sudden it just felt like this nightmare of a gauntlet.
[time=1071] And I just determined to ride through these two junior high boys and they began to say things to me.
[time=1077] They began to comment about the size of my head and my ears and they began to chase me.
[time=1083] And not only did they chase me, but they began to throw things.
[time=1086] They'd stop and pick up things and they were throwing things at me.
[time=1089] And then they'd speed up and get in front of me and they wouldn't let me go.
[time=1092] They'd push me around a little bit and then I'd get back on my bike and I'd try to keep riding.
[time=1096] And by this time I'm almost in tears and they're saying things I'd never heard before.
[time=1100] And these guys are mean big dudes and I'm a mess.
[time=1104] And finally with a kick, I'm on my leg.
[time=1107] They let me go and I go tearing around the corner and pulling up into my driveway and running to the house.
[time=1113] And my dad's there, home for lunch.
[time=1115] He said, "Hey dude, what's going on?" And I explained to my dad what had happened.
[time=1123] And my dad, my dad said, "Hey, I'll tell you what." You think they're still over there?
[time=1131] He said, "Yeah, I'm pretty sure they are." He said, "I'll tell you what." He says, "Why don't you just do it again?" I'm like, "What are you talking about?" He said, "I want you to get on your bike." And they said, "I just want you to ride around the block one more time." I said, "No, no, just ride your bike around the block one more time." It was an amazing few minutes that followed.
[time=1155] I got back on my bike and I rode down the block, turned the corner, started heading up to the other side.
[time=1160] There they were.
[time=1162] And I just rode my bike as fast as I could.
[time=1166] I was just going to try and split them and get down the street and around the corner.
[time=1170] And they kind of stood there and looked at me and they're laughing and they're saying things again.
[time=1174] I'll let me go and then they're going to chase me and knock me down and do their thing.
[time=1178] I fly right between them.
[time=1180] They kind of come in behind me.
[time=1181] I'm just peddling as fast as I can peddle.
[time=1184] And all of a sudden I look up and my dad is running down the street at me.
[time=1191] And he's got a smile on his face.
[time=1193] You know, now I'm looking back.
[time=1194] Then it seemed like he was running, you know, like 40 miles an hour.
[time=1198] I'm sure he was just jogging, trotting.
[time=1201] Nevertheless, there was my dad running down the middle of the street with a big smile on his face going like this.
[time=1208] So I go right past my dad and I turn and my dad, he chases in these guys.
[time=1214] Before they figured out what happened, my dad's got them both by the back of their shirts.
[time=1219] And I'm riding my bike looking back and my dad saves the day.
[time=1225] He's got these guys, but the back of their shirts, he's walking them to their house.
[time=1229] I turn the corner going to my house just going, "Oh, this is good."
[time=1235] It was amazing.
[time=1237] It was amazing to be in a fight.
[time=1242] It was amazing to be up against it.
[time=1246] And they have somebody come and stand by me.
[time=1250] They have somebody come and kind of help me in the battle.
[time=1254] You know what I mean?
[time=1256] You've been in a battle?
[time=1259] Anybody ever been up against it?
[time=1263] Anybody ever been in the midst of real persecution or mistreatment?
[time=1269] You ever been in a really unfair situation?
[time=1272] You ever been questioning what's going on and how all this is going to turn out?
[time=1277] You ever been in the midst of the attack?
[time=1279] You ever been in the battle?
[time=1281] Battles can be incredibly hurtful.
[time=1284] It can be scary places.
[time=1286] It can be a discouraging spot.
[time=1288] It can be a very lonely experience.
[time=1290] And yet to have someone willing to fight with you or even for you in those circumstances
[time=1296] or situations when you can't.
[time=1299] There's just nothing like it.
[time=1301] You know, the Israelites.
[time=1303] The Israelites and the pages of God's Word, the people of Israel, God's chosen race.
[time=1308] The Israelites knew what this was like, my friends.
[time=1311] The Israel experienced many, many times the rescuing heroic presence of God.
[time=1317] Times when the winds blew really hard and the sky got really dark and the circumstances
[time=1323] seemed really impossible and God stood with them.
[time=1326] God protected them.
[time=1328] And yes, even at times he fought for them.
[time=1333] It's an amazing picture and an amazing illustration of his great love.
[time=1338] The love of a father who's willing to stand our passage today and our ongoing study
[time=1344] of the book of Joshua is one of those times.
[time=1347] And it is one of the most, just my opinion, just my perspective.
[time=1351] I'm just sharing this with you today as I've read this, as I've thought this through, as I've seen it over the years and as I've come kind of back to it again in recent weeks, it's one of the most chilling, one of the most powerful, one of the most amazing, for me
[time=1365] at least, examples of God's willingness and God's readiness to come to the side and the
[time=1374] aid of his people.
[time=1376] I want you to watch this morning, really, figuratively, but really I want you to watch
[time=1384] how this unfolds this morning.
[time=1386] I want you to listen to see what the Word of God and the Spirit of God has to say to you today in the midst of whatever it is you might be facing, and I want you to be amazed all over again by a God who is so willing to run down the street and take care of those in need.
[time=1406] Stand with me, if you would.
[time=1407] Let me read this to you in honor of God's Word, would you stand and let me read Joshua chapter 10, verses 1 to 5, if you have your Bibles, open them up to Joshua chapter 10.
[time=1419] Going through 15 is the entire passage, we're going to begin with the first five verses.
[time=1424] It says, "Now it came about when Adonai Zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had
[time=1430] captured A.I. and had utterly destroyed it just as he had done to Jericho and its king,
[time=1437] so he had done to A.I. and its king, and that the inhabitants, when Adonai Zedek heard
[time=1443] that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel as well, and were within their
[time=1449] land that he feared greatly.
[time=1453] Because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than A.I. and all its men were mighty, therefore Adonai Zedek, king of Jerusalem, sent word
[time=1465] to Hohem, king of Hebron, and to Pyram, king of Jarmuth, and to Jafiah, king of Lakeish,
[time=1472] and the Debeer, king of Eglon, saying, 'Come up to Me, and help Me, and let us attack
[time=1478] Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel, so the five kings
[time=1485] of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lakeish, the king of Eglon, gathered together, and went up.
[time=1494] They with all their armies, and camped by Gibeon, and fought against it.'"
[time=1503] Let's pray.
[time=1506] Father God, there are so many in the room today.
[time=1508] Most of us here know what it's like, God, we have felt, and we remember what it is to
[time=1516] be attacked.
[time=1519] We know there is a very real enemy at work in our world, and at times in our lives, and
[time=1525] Father, we can remember the feeling when circumstantially God, in the midst of our lives, we face
[time=1533] His temptation, and we face the conflict that He brings, the uncertainty and the hurt.
[time=1541] Father God, as we look to Your Word today, to understand better the nature of these attacks, God to understand better what our response can be in the midst of an attack.
[time=1551] Father God, as we try to, resting completely on You, understand the evil and its tactics,
[time=1558] God, may You and Your Word in a powerful and life-changing way, help us to understand
[time=1565] and see so clearly God, a road that we can walk, a road that Joshua, and the people of
[time=1572] Israel walked, God, may we see that, and may You help us down that road, and may each of
[time=1581] us, by Your grace and with Your strength, walk that road, may we give great glory and
[time=1587] great honor, may we make much of You.
[time=1590] Thank You, Father, for the privilege of being together.
[time=1593] Thank You for the help that You bring and Your Son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1599] You can be seated.
[time=1603] Let me just come back and ask You this again.
[time=1605] I want to ask it in a slightly different way, because I really want You to understand, I think, some of the opportunities that are here for You and for me as we think this through this morning.
[time=1615] Have You ever been?
[time=1616] Let me just ask You.
[time=1617] Have You ever been?
[time=1618] And I don't mean now by bullies in the street I'm not talking about in the physical realm
[time=1624] of Your life or mine, but in the spiritual realm.
[time=1627] I just want to ask You, have You ever felt or have You ever been attacked?
[time=1633] Have You ever sensed or felt the enemy really coming at You?
[time=1639] I mean, have You ever just in the every day of trying to follow Christ, in the every day
[time=1647] of trying to live out Your faith, have You sensed that attack that comes at time from
[time=1653] the evil one who wants so desperately to destroy and discourage You?
[time=1660] Let me ask it this way.
[time=1662] Have You ever in the, I would imagine most of You in the room would answer that yes.
[time=1666] In the midst of maybe saying yes to that, let me ask You this, have You ever sensed in the midst of that attack that it was a very, very personal attack?
[time=1677] You ever felt like He was reading Your mail?
[time=1680] I mean, You ever felt like He was right there in Your backyard?
[time=1682] I mean, You ever felt like He knew exactly what to bring Your way?
[time=1687] Have You ever felt the personalness of the attack?
[time=1690] Have You ever sensed it was incredibly timely?
[time=1695] Have You ever just set back in the midst of a temptation or an onslaught of struggle and God?
[time=1701] My goodness, it's like He knows exactly what to do.
[time=1706] He knows my weakness.
[time=1708] He knows my struggles.
[time=1710] Well, you know what I believe and I believe God's word teaches this.
[time=1715] I believe He does.
[time=1717] I believe He knows your weaknesses and I believe He knows your struggles and I believe His
[time=1723] attacks are oftentimes extremely well thought through and very, very personal.
[time=1729] I believe that.
[time=1730] And generally speaking, and I want to bring you back to the text here and we're going to just kind of make our way through this morning, generally speaking, if you want to write this down, you can, I believe there's a reason.
[time=1741] Generally speaking, I believe there's a very specific and very personal reason that you and I face the attack of the enemy.
[time=1750] And I think it's very connected to what we see transpiring here in Joshua 10.
[time=1754] I believe there is a reason.
[time=1756] Here's the reason.
[time=1757] Go back to 10 verses 1 and 2.
[time=1759] What was going on in Joshua's life and the people of Israel, the people of Gibeon, this
[time=1766] alliance that's been made, this progress that's being made, look at what it says.
[time=1770] Now it came about when Adonai Zetik, king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had what?
[time=1775] He had captured AI and had utterly destroyed it just like they did Jericho and the inhabitants
[time=1783] of Gibeon have now made peace with Israel and were within their land that the king feared
[time=1789] greatly.
[time=1791] He feared greatly because you see Joshua and the people of Israel in their devotion and
[time=1798] commitment to God, at least here in this season, see their making progress.
[time=1804] They're moving forward.
[time=1806] Understand here that Joshua and the people of Israel are trying their best to faithfully
[time=1812] advance the kingdom of God.
[time=1816] They're doing their very best.
[time=1818] He was faithfully trying to further God's program.
[time=1821] He was trying his best with God's help to make a difference.
[time=1825] He's in his relationship with God trying to honor God.
[time=1828] He's trying to follow God.
[time=1830] He's trying to obey God.
[time=1831] It's as if a stake has been put in the ground, lines have been drawn and here we go.
[time=1836] We're going to do the right thing.
[time=1839] They've had some recent setbacks if you'll remember the story as we've made our way through it.
[time=1845] But now they've said, "You know what?
[time=1846] We're going forward and we're going forward faithfully and we're going forward with great endurance." And so as they begin to make their way forward, as they try to advance the kingdom of God,
[time=1859] the kings gather and the fight is on, I want to remind you this morning people that whether it's Joshua or you and I, guess what?
[time=1869] When you make a commitment to follow Him, when you, you in your life, you in your business,
[time=1875] you in your home, when we as Christ followers make commitments, young people, students,
[time=1881] young adults, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, it doesn't matter, young in between, old, when you or I make a commitment to follow Him.
[time=1890] When there is a desire in you to make a difference in the world He's placed you in.
[time=1896] When you forge in your heart and mind some new commitments to try and be unique and distinctive
[time=1902] and the living out of your faith, when you do that kind of thing, when you start to walk, that kind of road.
[time=1910] There is one, the enemy, who was incredibly irritated.
[time=1914] He's incredibly agitated.
[time=1916] He is completely and utterly against that.
[time=1922] And he can't in those times, as he does here, get extremely aggressive.
[time=1927] Difficulty and temptation are soon to follow.
[time=1933] I know it's very related, but I want to just make this point, if you look back at verse one, you realize that both at A.I. and at Jericho, Joshua and the nation of Israel had
[time=1944] been victorious.
[time=1946] And I just want to remind you of this, that oftentimes we see it in the Scriptures and oftentimes I've seen it in my own life.
[time=1954] And I've seen this in many lives.
[time=1956] I've seen this in your life, as we've shared our lives over the years.
[time=1960] Oftentimes, my friends, following the great victory, whatever that may have looked like,
[time=1967] whatever that may have entailed for you, whatever that may have entailed for me, oftentimes after the victory comes the strongest amount of temptation.
[time=1977] After the victory sometimes comes the strongest amount of opportunity that the enemy throws
[time=1984] your way and mind to move away from the very ground that God has just allowed you to take.
[time=1991] Somebody said it this way, "Sometimes our greatest failures come while the confetti is still falling from the victory celebration.
[time=1997] Attack follows attainment, temptation follows triumph, seduction follows success, weakness
[time=2003] is often evidenced in the wake of great strength."
[time=2009] I can't help but think about just some individuals from the pages of Scripture.
[time=2013] I think about Peter.
[time=2015] I think about the great disciple who there in the garden with our Lord as the Roman cohort at hundreds and hundreds of soldiers come to take our Lord.
[time=2024] And you'll remember most of you, well, Peter, who stands there in that moment with great courage and with great bravery and he pulls his sword and he takes off the ear of the
[time=2035] aid to the high priest.
[time=2037] Remember that?
[time=2038] Wasn't going to let him take him, stood for what was right, protected the name and the person of Christ.
[time=2047] Great victory and while the confetti is still falling, only hours later he stands by a fire
[time=2053] and denies he ever knew the Lord.
[time=2059] After victory, it's as if the enemy is watching.
[time=2063] It's as if he's mindful of your choices and mind and when you make the right one and when
[time=2069] you make the right one a couple, two or three times and you find yourself in a place of great blessing and honor all of a sudden it's like he just brings it.
[time=2077] I think about Joseph back in Genesis, Joseph just who faced some unbelievable circumstances
[time=2084] and yet remained so faithful, sold in the slavery by his brothers tossed in a pit, sold
[time=2090] to a bunch of folks on camels taken to Egypt, bought by Potiphar in the midst of it all.
[time=2094] He serves, he's faithful, he's honest.
[time=2099] And as he serves and as he's faithful and as he's honest, God gives him a position with Potiphar, Potiphar governor of Egypt, gives him a position in Potiphar's home of great respect and so it's as if he finally comes to this place where in the midst of all that
[time=2113] he's gone through now, he attains this place of honor and boom, the enemy brings it in the form of who, Potiphar's wife, who comes to the young man and says, "Lay with me."
[time=2128] He handled that well as the story goes, as we've read that before and talked about that, but that's how it goes and I bring that to your attention today as a warning, as a caution
[time=2139] that when and if you're ready to follow him, when and if you and I are ready to state our intentions to honor and bring glory to him, when and if you and I are in the midst of following
[time=2150] and obeying, those are the times he brings it and sometimes he brings it hard and sometimes
[time=2157] he's relentless because he doesn't want you capturing AI, he doesn't want you victorious.
[time=2167] It's interesting, you know, if I were just to be just really honest with all of you,
[time=2180] which I don't mind being, I never have and I'll continue to just shoot straight with you, you know, I don't know how it is with you, but I'll just tell you for me, if you were going to graph, if you were going to make a chart of my, but the times in my week
[time=2196] when I'm most tempted, if you were just going to take my week, seven days, 24/7 and if we
[time=2207] just put it up on the screen and we could just graph, when in a typical week for me,
[time=2213] I'm most tempted in whatever, attack.
[time=2222] Guess what the clear, guess what the clear winner would be, if we were looking at time periods in my week, Sunday afternoons, it's just how it is and I don't know what it is
[time=2239] for you, I don't know what your graph would look like, but I after 20 some years, I can just tell you, you know, there's so much work put in, there's so much thought put in, there's so much effort made to try to do my best to stand and do what God's called me to do, God's called you to do some significant things as well, but it's like, you know, I can just feel it sometimes on the drive home.
[time=2261] And I would just encourage you, as others have encouraged me to be so very careful and
[time=2267] proactive in those times, to just know that whatever it is you do and whenever it is
[time=2273] you're giving him your most, to just know that right there and right then, it's very likely to come, well we have a response, there is a response that God calls forth from us
[time=2285] and we see Joshua, you know, we see the nation of Israel here in chapter 10, modeling for
[time=2293] us this response, our response to the attack, go to verse 6.
[time=2299] It says then the men, so Gibbians under attack and then it says in verse 6, then the men of Gibbians sent word to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal saying, do not abandon your servants,
[time=2310] come up to us quickly, see they're in partnership now, they're one in a sense, come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the Amorites that live in the hill country have assembled against us and so watch, so Joshua went, so Joshua went up from Gilgal,
[time=2327] he and all the people of war with him and all the valiant warriors and the Lord said to Joshua, do not fear them for I have given them into your hands, not one of them shall stand before you and so verse 9, so Joshua, watch this, so Joshua came upon them suddenly
[time=2344] by marching what, say it, all night, all night from Gilgal, what's his response, I'll tell
[time=2357] you what the response is, the response is this, you want to attack me, you want to bring
[time=2363] your evil scheme, you want to bring difficulty my way, evil one, you want to gather the five
[time=2370] kings and try and ruin what God is doing, you know what, not going to happen and when
[time=2377] the enemy brings the fight, Joshua's response is to fight back.
[time=2384] He fights back, he went to war, he put on the armor, outnumbered and outmanned, he picked
[time=2391] up a weapon and said evil will not win, he is so devoted to the response, he is so committed
[time=2397] to the counter attack, he is so not going to sit there and just kind of see how this
[time=2404] thing plays out, no, he marches, but he doesn't just march, he marches all night long because
[time=2411] he can't wait to get there and fire back.
[time=2419] How much fight, let me just ask you this this morning, how much fight is there in you?
[time=2427] You're tempted, I know you are, he comes up against you, he fires the arrow, the difficulty
[time=2438] comes, how much fight is there in you?
[time=2441] How willing and ready are you to not just say no which so many times you and I need to say to the temptation, but to fight it, to actually pick up a weapon and to actually
[time=2455] with great aggressiveness and determination because of a love for God and a desire to have this relationship be what he's called it to be, how willing are you and I to fight?
[time=2467] And you say okay, I think I'm with you, I'd like to fight, how do I fight, what are you referring to there?
[time=2473] Let me just give you a couple things that come to my mind.
[time=2476] I think we fight the attack, there's several ways that we do this, there's several ways I believe scripture calls us to do this, one of the ways in which we fight the attack, one of the ways in which you can respond is to fight the attack with scriptures.
[time=2492] You should read through the gospels sometime and when you come to that section where Jesus is being tempted by the enemy himself, he's out in the wilderness you'll remember and the enemy comes in directly, frontal assault just right there, temps our Lord and in each
[time=2508] of the temptations our Lord responds by reciting what?
[time=2514] Scripture, the word, the never changing, always strong and true word of God and it reminds
[time=2523] me of Psalm 11911, many of you have memorized it, your word I have what?
[time=2528] Your word I have treasured, your word I have hid, your word I have deposited, your word
[time=2535] I have stored in my heart and I haven't just stored it for a good grade on a test, I haven't
[time=2542] just stored it there for a star on my head on Wednesday nights down the hall, I haven't just stored it there because good Christians do that, no no no no no, I've stored God's word in my heart because I'm going to get attacked tomorrow.
[time=2557] He's going to come after me, you the housewife, the married couple, the high school student,
[time=2563] the young adult in the room, he wants you ruined and destroyed and discouraged and when he brings
[time=2570] the attack and when he brings the temptation God's word says, store up that truth in your heart so that you may not what, so you may not sin.
[time=2581] So in that moment you can have a response to the enemy that is a clear statement of your
[time=2587] intent and a clear statement of what's true and right and I wonder, I wonder how many,
[time=2593] some of you in the room have been at this for a while, some of you in the room are just starting, praise God for both.
[time=2603] I wonder how long it's been since you memorized scripture, how long has it been since you made
[time=2611] a real strong, aggressive, intentional effort to take four or five passages or verses and
[time=2617] memorize them, to hide them, to store them up for your fight, for your response to the
[time=2625] temptation.
[time=2628] Some of you in the room would know exactly what to do tonight, if I just, and I am, if I just, I'm going to tell you right here, you know what, you should memorize, you should take the struggle, you should take that area of weakness in your life, you should take that one specific or two or three specific arenas of temptation that you know you struggle
[time=2647] with and you know he comes after you in that arena or in that situation and you should
[time=2654] take some scriptures that apply to those situations and you should read them and pray through them and hide them in your heart.
[time=2663] And many of you in the room this morning can go home today and find those passages and do that.
[time=2668] I'll tell you what, if you're here today and you don't have a clue where to go, you couldn't find four or five verses that would help you but you really want help, you come talk to us.
[time=2680] You come talk to us afterwards and we'll help you, we'll give you some direction.
[time=2684] You can fight the attack with scripture.
[time=2688] You can also write this down.
[time=2689] You can also fight the attack with accountability, accountability in community, in relationship,
[time=2697] in personal, spiritual relationship with others, you can fight the attack.
[time=2702] Look at the screen, Ecclesiastes 4, write this down, Ecclesiastes 4, 9, 10 and 12.
[time=2708] I love these verses.
[time=2710] It says two are better than what, say it.
[time=2713] Two are better than one.
[time=2715] God never intended any of you to live or try and make your way through the spiritual journey alone.
[time=2721] Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor.
[time=2726] It says in verse 10, "For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion but woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up." There are many in the room this morning and you could attest to the fact of how dismal it is, how dark it is, how discouraging it is to fall when you're alone.
[time=2750] In most cases, it's how you fell because you were alone and then there's no one there
[time=2756] to pick you up, God never intended.
[time=2759] You and I to face that, look at verse 12, I love this, and if one can overpower him who is alone and can one, can one overpower him who is alone, yes or no?
[time=2769] Yes, absolutely.
[time=2771] Two, two can resist him, but wait, a court of what, say it?
[time=2776] A court of three strands, the one in others, the community of God's people, the relationships
[time=2783] he allows us to have, and I'll tell you what, if you don't have any, you're in trouble.
[time=2788] You've got a massive target on your heart and we can help you.
[time=2794] If you need help with that, let us know and we want to introduce you to people.
[time=2800] We want to get you connected to folks who you can live and share your life with as scary as that may sound, as good as that might sound.
[time=2809] We need community.
[time=2810] We fight the attack with scriptures, we can fight the attack with accountability in community with others.
[time=2816] I want to be clear on this.
[time=2821] Some may see this differently, some might say this differently.
[time=2824] This is how I would say it to you, I believe that God, as I read the scriptures and as I've studied them for years, now I believe God has allowed the enemy.
[time=2833] I believe this, that God has allowed the enemy some level of freedom to bring the attack.
[time=2842] We see it again and again and again.
[time=2844] I don't think he has ultimate power.
[time=2847] I believe there's probably some limitations, but I believe for now, I believe God has allowed the enemy some level of freedom to attack.
[time=2856] I also believe that he has to an even greater degree and don't miss that.
[time=2863] I believe he's allowed that.
[time=2864] I believe to an even greater degree that he has equipped and empowered each of us to
[time=2870] respond.
[time=2873] There is the armor of God, there is the strength of the Spirit, there is the opportunities you and I have in relationship with others and in relationship with him to be the people of God who fight, who respond.
[time=2885] Not with each other, not with our God, but with the enemy.
[time=2891] Having said that, I want you to see this.
[time=2896] There's a reason for the attack.
[time=2899] There's a response that I believe where to have to the attack and that's to be an aggressive response, but I have been waiting all week.
[time=2909] I've got nothing else on my notes.
[time=2913] I don't know what I'm going to say after I have been waiting all week to read the rest of this to you and really I just want to read it to you and I just want you to listen and
[time=2926] I want you to hear it.
[time=2929] It may not strike you.
[time=2931] Maybe it was just me this week going through what I've been going through and you know how that is.
[time=2935] Sometimes scripture just it just speaks to you in a powerful way as you find yourself in a unique situation.
[time=2942] So for me it was just amazing all over again to think about this attack, to think about those boys on their bikes and my dad, to think about the things you face and are in the midst of and to think about our response, but then to realize that in the midst of that there
[time=2958] is a posture that God has many times in the midst of our battles, it just blew me away.
[time=2971] So I've been waiting all week.
[time=2972] I'm so excited.
[time=2973] Here we go.
[time=2975] Verse 9, Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching all night from Gilagas.
[time=2979] So there's the response on our part.
[time=2980] Now verse 10 now just listen to this and the Lord confounded them, the enemy, the Amorites,
[time=2992] all these thousands of souls and the Lord confounded them before Israel and he slew them
[time=2999] with a great slaughter at Gibbian and pursued them by the way of ascent of Beth Horan and
[time=3008] struck them as far as Azekah and Makeda.
[time=3012] And as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent, he's describing a geographical place there where the trail began to go down the descent of Beth Horan.
[time=3024] At that place the Lord threw large stones from heaven on them.
[time=3034] The Lord threw large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah and they died.
[time=3044] And there were more who died from the hailstones that God threw from heaven.
[time=3058] And there were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed
[time=3065] with the sword.
[time=3066] Watch it gets better.
[time=3070] Then Joshua, here's the heart, listen, here's the heart, watch this.
[time=3075] This is the heart of one who's still, he's still in response mode.
[time=3080] I mean he's still doing his best to having surveyed the situation.
[time=3084] He's still trying to give himself to this response.
[time=3087] God is being attacked.
[time=3088] What is right and true is good, the enemy has come against.
[time=3092] And so now Joshua is responding and he marched all night and he's engaged in the battle.
[time=3099] And now he says in verse 12, then Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel.
[time=3107] And he said, Joshua said in the sight of all of Israel, "O son, S-U-N, O son, stand still
[time=3115] at Gibeon, and O moon in the valley of Isilon."
[time=3123] And I don't know my friends for the life of me.
[time=3126] I don't understand how God does what he does or why God did what he did then and does what
[time=3133] he does now and how sometimes that seems or feels different to us.
[time=3137] But what I know is in this case, this is what he did.
[time=3142] So the sun stood what?
[time=3147] And the moon, what?
[time=3152] Did you see that?
[time=3155] It did.
[time=3157] The sun, first of all, back up to the request.
[time=3160] Somebody first hour came up to me, a wonderful gal, genuinely asking, "Why did he pray for
[time=3168] the sun to stand still?" Why couldn't they just pick it up where they left off?
[time=3176] That's how they did it in those days.
[time=3178] When the day came to an end, you were done and you'd pick back up in the morning, right?
[time=3185] He didn't want to pick back up in the morning.
[time=3188] He wanted to answer the attack to hear him, "Oh God, don't let this day stop.
[time=3197] We need to respond to the attack.
[time=3201] We need to fight the enemy.
[time=3203] And oh God, please have the moon stop and the sun stand still and let this day go on so we can, so I can, but God with your help and by your grace, finish this thing in a
[time=3215] way that would bring great glory and honor to you." So the sun stood still and the moon stopped until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies, is it not written in the book of Jashar and the sun stopped in the middle of the sky
[time=3231] and did not hasten to go down for about a whole what?
[time=3237] There was no day like that.
[time=3240] You see that?
[time=3241] There was no day like that before it or after it.
[time=3245] Here it is.
[time=3246] Here's the whole nine yards.
[time=3247] The Lord listened to the voice of a man for the Lord said, "The Lord, the Lord, the Lord
[time=3262] God, Joshua's Lord, your Lord, my God, he fought.
[time=3278] He ran down the street and picked up two jerks by their t-shirts.
[time=3284] My God, he fought for them, he threw, he threw rocks from heaven.
[time=3294] He was so for them and many of you in the room this morning just need either a gentle
[time=3300] or even strong reminder of that fact and of this great truth that your God is for you.
[time=3309] And there may be times, don't forget Aiken.
[time=3313] You know, there may be times when in your sin, there may be times in my sin, there may be times in our unfaithfulness where it feels or seems like he's not for us.
[time=3324] And the fact of the matter is he may be disciplining you.
[time=3328] And sometimes you think he should and he doesn't.
[time=3331] And sometimes you're being faithful and you think he should throw rocks from heaven and he doesn't.
[time=3336] I understand that.
[time=3336] I'm not giving you a formula here.
[time=3338] It's not always a one-for-one, but in so many cases as we read and study this, we see that
[time=3345] in the midst of great faithfulness and obedience, there is a God who comes alongside and is
[time=3353] willing to take care of those guys on the other side of the block and be encouraged today
[time=3361] that your God loves you.
[time=3364] Be faithful, put a stake in the ground, make a difference in your world, advance the kingdom,
[time=3373] love your family, have integrity at work, and know that as you commit to those things, the attack is going to come but know that in the midst of that, you have a God and you serve a God and you and I have the privilege of knowing a God who throws stones from heaven,
[time=3391] makes the sun stand still so the battle can be fought.
[time=3395] Amen?
[time=3396] Would you stand, please?
[time=3398] And let me close this in a word of prayer.
[time=3404] Father, God, we thank you.
[time=3410] So many of us in the room this morning, just from the bottom of our hearts, God, we're so grateful that for years, in many cases here in this room, we can attest to years.
[time=3421] Of you fighting for us, you holding us and you giving us great strength and courage just
[time=3427] by your heroic presence in times where we knew we wouldn't have enough.
[time=3433] Father, God, I pray that those in the room this morning that know you, that have a relationship with you, God, those here who have fully surrendered, their hearts and lives to you, God, I pray that in our faithfulness and in our pursuit of you, that we would remember your posture
[time=3450] in the midst of our attack, God, you are for us and may that bring great comfort and may
[time=3456] that bring a great reminder, a sense of courage and willingness to continue on.
[time=3464] Father, God, for those in the room that don't know you yet, for those in the room that haven't fully given their hearts and lives, for those in the room who face those battles, spiritually
[time=3475] speaking, alone, God, may we have the privilege.
[time=3480] Me, personally, others on our staff, Christ-following friends of theirs who have brought them, God,
[time=3489] may we have the privilege of introducing them to you, of talking with them about a relationship
[time=3496] and a life lived with you.
[time=3501] Father, God, may they come to know you and may they be willing to confess and repent of their sins and give themselves, God, to a fully surrendered life, a life changed
[time=3513] now and forever because of your work on the cross.
[time=3517] Father, God, thank you for this time.
[time=3520] Together this morning, and God, may we leave committed to accountability and may we leave committed to the Scriptures and may we do everything within our power.
[time=3528] And God would you please help us to fight the attack with tools of that nature.
[time=3558] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
