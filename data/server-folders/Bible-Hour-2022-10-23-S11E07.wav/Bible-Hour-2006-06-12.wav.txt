[time=30] Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and
[time=50] honor. Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the
[time=61] Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always,
[time=77] even to the end of the age, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=87] Last week we talked about that this altar represents worship and sacrifice that they're inseparable.
[time=104] This week I want to focus on the sacrifice, the cost, to allow us to worship God,
[time=110] because they are inseparable. When we bring a sacrifice that is pleasing, that is acceptable before God, we are allowed to worship. So this week I would like to, let's just kind of get a glimpse of what this sacrifice is.
[time=122] Sacrifice means to kill or to slaughter. It involves pain, it involves loss.
[time=130] We don't use the word sacrifice very often in our culture, maybe in baseball, a sacrifice fly that allows a runner to go, but that's just a strategic move.
[time=139] That's not a sacrifice, there's no pain, there's no real loss with that sacrifice.
[time=145] If you and I were alive a few thousand years ago and we wanted to worship God, we'd build an altar similar to this, and then we would need to find a sacrifice, something to, as we entered God's presence that we wanted to worship, we want to express to him
[time=162] what we're thinking, what we're thinking is Lord I'm fully surrendered to you, my heart is fully surrendered to you, and when we pray, when you talk to God, we're telling God Lord, my heart is fully surrendered to you, that's an acceptable sacrifice, but if I wanted to physically demonstrate that surrender, how would I do that?
[time=180] Back in Genesis 12 we're told that there's no human sacrifice, so I can't kill myself as an example of my heart surrender,
[time=191] and I can't kill another human being, so there cannot be human sacrifice, that's not pleasing before God, so the alternative is something that would cause me pain and loss, another animal.
[time=200] Now not just another animal, if you and I, a few thousand years ago, we would not go to animals or us,
[time=206] and go pick up a goat and head on to our altar and sacrifice it, because there's no emotional attachment to that sacrifice.
[time=214] Part of the symbolism, part of my demonstration to God about my fully surrendered heart,
[time=220] is the pain and loss that this animal would cause me, so what we would do as someone who would be in agriculture
[time=228] and who have livestock in the back, we would go to our pasture and pick a perfect, a perfect lamb,
[time=237] one that has no blemishes, and we'd pick that perfect lamb, and it's a lamb that had cost us something
[time=243] because we had reared it, we had protected it, we had paid for the food for it, so to give it to God would have cost us something,
[time=252] and there would be somewhat of an emotional attachment to it as well.
[time=257] What's interesting is that God's perspective on this is he is not solely interested in what is laid up here,
[time=265] as much as what's going on right here of the person who's laying it.
[time=269] So it's not the sacrifice that is his issue, it's the heart of the sacrifice, sir.
[time=275] So it's not the gift that God is interested in as much as the giver's heart.
[time=281] So as we think about worship and sacrifice as inseparable, if we want to worship God, God is looking at our heart saying, is it fully surrendered? In your mind are you fully surrendered?
[time=289] When you talk to me, do you talk to me like a fully surrendered individual?
[time=293] And what symbolism, what do you bring to show me that you are fully surrendered?
[time=299] What sacrifice can I accept so I can just give you my presence?
[time=305] Well, most of us aren't in agriculture today, so that the whole idea of sacrificing an animal is a foreign concept,
[time=311] unless you have a pet at home.
[time=315] I want you to think about this, would you allow your pet to die to show your love for God?
[time=323] If God asks you, I want you to allow your pet to die as an act of commitment before me that you love me more than anything else.
[time=335] Would you allow your pet to die? Okay, that's not the right question.
[time=341] Would your hand be willing to kill your own pet?
[time=347] If that's what it took to show God that your heart is fully surrendered to him, there is nothing else above him.
[time=355] That's a tough question.
[time=357] Psalm 51, 16 and 17 says, "O Lord, you do not light and sacrifice, or I would bring it.
[time=365] You do not desire burnt offerings, or a broken heart, a broken and contrite spirit.
[time=371] O Lord, that you will not despise. It's our heart."
[time=377] But the sacrifice many times reflects the commitment in our heart.
[time=382] This morning, I want to kind of do something that may be a little bit difficult for you to accept,
[time=388] but I want to really help us understand that worship and sacrifice are inseparable,
[time=394] and that sacrifice causes pain and loss.
[time=397] And it's our heart that's reflected. It's the giver.
[time=401] It's okay, it's a great sacrifice, and I'm sad that that animal had to die, but this reflects, "Lord, I will do this for you."
[time=410] And this morning, I want to try to experience that with you, and maybe show you what it would feel like.
[time=416] There's some evidence that Jewish families a few thousand years ago, when they would do this, that the father of the house, when a baby lamb was born, they would bring it in the home
[time=427] and allow the kids to become attached to it.
[time=430] And so, yeah, they feed it, it costs them something, yes, they protect it, but not only that, they become emotionally attached to this lamb. So when it's time to sacrifice, to kill or to slaughter this lamb,
[time=442] there is a great cost. There is a great pain and a great loss.
[time=448] It would be like giving up your pet. For God.
[time=452] So this morning, I would like to ask Tammy Crane. This is Doug Crane's wife, the Crane family,
[time=458] members here, Doug is a pastor here. She's going to bring their pet.
[time=466] And I hope to show you, possibly, the great cost.
[time=471] It costs us the sacrifice we need that God requires for our heart.
[time=477] So for Tammy, who loves Baxter here, to allow Baxter to be sacrificed, is making a statement before God. That God, I will give up everything for you.
[time=488] My heart is fully surrendered to you. It's the heart, not the sacrifice.
[time=494] But this is what it would look like. The owner would actually place it on the altar.
[time=500] Let's turn him around, his head on this side. She would lay him down.
[time=509] And then the person actually doing the sacrifice would take the knife, would spread his neck out because it slit his throat, would take his knife, and say something like, "God, may you accept this sacrifice, and may it be pleasing for you."
[time=539] I'm there for know how much it costs to see.
[time=560] I say, upon that grace, and I'm there for know how much it costs
[time=585] to see my sin, upon that grace.
[time=598] Sing together.
[time=599] I'm there for know how much it costs to see my sin, upon that grace.
[time=1284] He comes to a point in his life where it's time for him as any good leader would do.
[time=1289] As we have opportunities, especially towards the end, to sit with or be with our people.
[time=1295] He has them come around and he begins to with them reflect on the goodness and the faithfulness of God.
[time=1302] He begins to collectively, if you will, with them.
[time=1305] Remember, look at chapter 23, verse 1.
[time=1308] It says, "Now it came about after many days when the Lord had given rest to Israel.
[time=1312] From all their enemies, on every side, and Joshua was old, advanced in years,
[time=1319] that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, and their heads, and their judges,
[time=1326] and their officers, and he said to them, "I am old, advanced in years."
[time=1332] And here you go, verse 3.
[time=1333] And you, the people of Israel, you have seen, important to note that, maybe just underline that.
[time=1340] And you have seen all that the Lord your God has done to all these nations because of you,
[time=1347] for the Lord your God, Israel, for the Lord your God is he who has been what?
[time=1353] Say it out loud.
[time=1354] Fighting for you.
[time=1356] We saw that last week in chapter 10 in such a powerful way.
[time=1361] The God of the universe, the God of the Israelites, opening up the clouds and literally fighting
[time=1368] shame in the midst of the battle for his people.
[time=1374] What I want you to see and begin to sense this morning, my friends, is this, that the faithfulness of God, the protection of God, the deliverance of God my friends should produce
[time=1389] or cultivate in you and in me a deepening and a sincere devotion.
[time=1397] Let me say that to you one more time.
[time=1399] I believe the faithfulness of God.
[time=1401] When you look back on it, when you experience it, when you see it and sense it in your life, the faithfulness of God, the deliverance of God, the protection of God should be producing
[time=1412] in you and in me greater levels of sincere devotion and reciprocal faithfulness to him.
[time=1423] As you look back, what do you see?
[time=1426] Do this for me.
[time=1428] If you've got access to one, just please, everybody, just for a moment here, pick up a pen.
[time=1433] You've got a pen or a pencil, just anything to write with and then just kind of find a blank piece of paper or a blank part of a piece of paper.
[time=1440] Just find something to write on and just humor me here, just for a moment.
[time=1444] Would you do this?
[time=1445] Would you take that pen or pencil and just a blank little section of paper and would you just draw a dot over on one side, then draw a line from that dot and then put another dot at the end?
[time=1456] So you have a line going across your paper with a dot at one end and a dot at the other.
[time=1461] That first dot is when you fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ.
[time=1467] Just mentally make a note of that.
[time=1469] As you make your way all the way across that line to the other dot at the end, that's today.
[time=1475] That's not the end, that's just where you've come to this point in time.
[time=1480] Now in between those two dots, back here at the beginning, just a little ways in, just make a little hash mark, a little tick right across the line, just a little line there in the middle, make a line and then towards the other end, make a little line.
[time=1492] So you've got three little hash marks in between the dots.
[time=1496] You've ended up in geometry.
[time=1498] You thought you came to church.
[time=1500] Bear with me now.
[time=1501] Would you just take a minute?
[time=1504] And would you just look back from today, however far you've come or wherever God has
[time=1511] brought you again?
[time=1512] Maybe it's been two weeks, maybe it's been two years, maybe it's been 50 plus.
[time=1517] But you kind of just look back on the spiritual horizon of your life and just three, just
[time=1525] kind of just find three significant events.
[time=1529] Just think back and identify maybe just with those little marks there between three significant people or two events in one person, just times, seasons of your life where God along
[time=1540] that timeline, He did significant things in growing you and developing you, maybe discipling
[time=1548] you.
[time=1549] Maybe there was a significant event that occurred.
[time=1551] Just think back over those years or months and then just write down next to those little
[time=1557] marks, the faithfulness of God, the things He did, the people He used, the crisis that
[time=1566] was met that He grew you in the midst of.
[time=1569] Would you do that?
[time=1570] Just go ahead.
[time=1571] Just write a few things down.
[time=1573] Maybe He kept your marriage together.
[time=1576] Maybe He healed you.
[time=1579] Maybe He held you up in the midst of enormous difficulty.
[time=1583] What was it?
[time=1584] Who did He use?
[time=1585] You can write down an event, you can write down a name.
[time=1589] But look back over the last several months or years and just jot down some spiritually significant things that would represent to you today as you remember the faithfulness
[time=1601] of God.
[time=1605] As you write a few things down there, join me in Joshua 23.9.
[time=1610] I wonder what emotions, I wonder what feelings are evoked in you as you just do that little exercise.
[time=1615] I just invited you to.
[time=1618] I wonder if you're so very grateful.
[time=1620] I wonder if you're so thankful.
[time=1622] I wonder if you're amazed as you begin to actually think back on those events.
[time=1627] I wonder how the people of Israel felt.
[time=1629] Look at 23.9 to 11.
[time=1632] For the Lord has driven out, this is again Joshua, he's got the people around him.
[time=1636] They're looking back on the faithfulness of God.
[time=1638] For the Lord has driven out great and strong nations before you.
[time=1643] Just think about what these people had seen, my friends.
[time=1647] Your stories, what's represented there on your dot, on your lap right now, my friends
[time=1653] you've heard me before, we've said this to you, that is a significant story.
[time=1658] That is a miracle right there as you think through his work in your life.
[time=1662] That is an incredible deal.
[time=1664] Think about what these people had experienced.
[time=1667] For the Lord has driven out great and strong nations from before you.
[time=1671] And as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.
[time=1675] One of your men puts to flight a thousand.
[time=1679] For the Lord your God is he who fights for you.
[time=1682] Just as he promised you.
[time=1684] So verse 11, take diligent heed to yourselves.
[time=1688] You see that phrase right there in the Hebrew or translated into the vernacular, the everyday language of our day, that would mean pay attention.
[time=1700] That would mean, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop here.
[time=1701] Don't go too fast.
[time=1702] Read this carefully.
[time=1703] Give some thought to what I'm saying.
[time=1707] Take heed, he says in verse 11.
[time=1710] Take diligent heed to yourselves in light of or in view of all of that that I've done.
[time=1718] Take diligent heed to yourselves to love, to love the Lord your God.
[time=1726] My friends, his faithfulness should produce devotion, his protection and deliverance.
[time=1730] I believe breeds allegiance and loyalty.
[time=1733] And we offer our love to him who has fought for us, who has defended us, who has come
[time=1740] and stood next to us in the midst of all that we have faced.
[time=1745] Look at verse 14.
[time=1748] The passage is Joshua continues to address the people it takes a little turn here, very
[time=1754] important turn, something for you and I to consider and be aware of.
[time=1757] It says in verse 14, "Now behold today I am going the way of all the earth." It's time for him to die.
[time=1763] And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, it's kind of his way of saying,
[time=1769] "I know you know this deep down within you, but not one word of all the good words which
[time=1775] the Lord your God spoke concerning you has failed." Think about that.
[time=1781] Not one word of all the good words which the Lord your God spoke, not one of them has failed, all have been fulfilled for you.
[time=1790] Not one of them has failed.
[time=1794] It shall come about, but just as all the good words which the Lord your God spoke to you
[time=1800] have come upon you, so the Lord will bring upon you all the threats until he has destroyed
[time=1807] you from off this good land which the Lord your God has promised you.
[time=1812] When you transgress the covenant of the Lord your God which he commanded you and go and
[time=1818] serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the Lord will burn against you
[time=1824] and you will perish quickly from off the good land which he has given you.
[time=1832] He has been faithful.
[time=1835] He has been good.
[time=1836] He has been steadfast.
[time=1838] He has been a God who has followed through with everything he has said.
[time=1842] He has upheld you.
[time=1843] He has delivered you.
[time=1845] He has protected you.
[time=1848] And if you are faithful, if you are reciprocally given to great trust and a willingness to follow
[time=1856] him, you'll be blessed if you don't, if you go and serve the other gods, little gee.
[time=1863] Interesting phrase, look at the end of verse 16 there.
[time=1867] You will perish quickly from off the good land which he has given you.
[time=1874] The good land.
[time=1875] Hey, I'll take you back several weeks, okay?
[time=1878] If you were here at the beginning of our study in Joshua, you know that we spent some time talking about the land.
[time=1884] Remember the promised land.
[time=1886] They had for generations, they had for years been looking forward to the promised land.
[time=1891] I asked you that day, what's your promised land?
[time=1894] And we talked about that.
[time=1896] And as we talked about that, we came to the very clear realization that while, yes, they were indeed looking forward to a day when they would have a new address.
[time=1905] They were looking forward to this geographical place that's true as we studied that and as
[time=1911] we looked at that, we realized that this promised land was about much, much more than rocks
[time=1917] and streams and mountains.
[time=1920] It was about, if you'll remember back in Joshua 1, it was about a place of rest.
[time=1927] It has never been about rocks and streams and mountains with our God people.
[time=1931] It has always been about a relationship where we find rest with Him.
[time=1940] He says, look, if you're going to go the other way on me, if you're going to turn and
[time=1946] move in an opposite direction, it's not going to go so well.
[time=1951] It's going to get pretty muddy, it's going to get pretty dark.
[time=1956] You will perish quickly from off the good land, which He has given you.
[time=1961] If my faithfulness, if my protection, if my deliverance is ignored, you end up in time
[time=1968] losing the rest, the relationship.
[time=1973] It gets fractured.
[time=1974] Well, you know what, God didn't want this for His people.
[time=1978] You know that, right?
[time=1979] God didn't want that warning He gives, He didn't want that to come true.
[time=1985] Joshua didn't want that for those people.
[time=1988] I don't want that for us.
[time=1991] I want there to be a sense in your life and mind where we experience the full blessing of God, where you and I would be willing in light of His faithfulness and protection and deliverance to follow Him with whole hearts day in and day out.
[time=2007] So Joshua, again, it's classic, classic Joshua, classic leadership.
[time=2015] You've seen it done.
[time=2016] I've seen it done in a number of different settings.
[time=2018] There is no more powerful setting than this, what we see in the pages of Scripture.
[time=2023] Joshua, in one last push to get this point across, does what so many have done in the
[time=2029] past.
[time=2030] And it says, He literally right there with His people, right there with the team, right there with the family.
[time=2036] He just goes back in time and He begins to event by event, moment by moment, miracle
[time=2043] after miracle.
[time=2045] God's showing up in miraculous ways, time and time and time again.
[time=2049] He just goes back and He paints this incredible picture within about 14 verses.
[time=2057] And I would just, you know, you give anything sometimes to be able to be there, to see what
[time=2064] that would have been like.
[time=2067] I imagine you just could have heard a pin drop as He revisits, as He remembers with them.
[time=2076] The truth about what God had done.
[time=2078] Listen, just join in the conversation, chapter 24, verse 1, here we go.
[time=2087] And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel
[time=2093] and for their heads and their judges and their officers, and they presented themselves before God.
[time=2099] And Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, this is a word
[time=2105] from the Lord." Joshua willing to be the mouthpiece, but now God begins to address.
[time=2111] He says, "From ancient times," here you go, here's the journey, "from ancient times your fathers lived beyond the river, namely Tara, the father of Abraham, and the father of
[time=2121] Nahor, and they served other gods." Then I took down, let me stop there just for a moment, other gods, it's the second time it's come up.
[time=2129] Let me just say this to you briefly.
[time=2130] As you hear in the text, and as we read here in this passage, when you see the comparison between serving God, capital G, Jehovah God, when you see the comparison between serving
[time=2142] God and serving other gods, little G, in that day, in this culture, if we were to go back
[time=2151] and look at the religions, not the relationship, but the religions that were prevalent at that
[time=2158] time, the other teachings that had at points kind of seep their way into the hearts and
[time=2164] lives of God's people, if you took all of that religion and you kind of just melted it down to two or three basic components, here's what it looked like.
[time=2174] And you know what?
[time=2176] It doesn't look, it doesn't look a whole lot different today.
[time=2180] If you took all those ancient religions, these other gods, it would be about three things.
[time=2185] Number one, you would find in those religions the absolute worship of self, the lifting
[time=2191] of self, self-ideology.
[time=2195] There was an enormous commitment to one's self in the midst of those teachings.
[time=2201] Secondly, there was a preoccupation and obsession with stuff, materialism, the gold
[time=2207] and the goods and the cash.
[time=2209] There was self-ideology, there was materialism and then there would be in most of those little
[time=2215] G gods, this kind of overt violation of God's design for pleasure.
[time=2222] Selfishness, materialism and hedonism on one side and then the god of the Bible on the
[time=2233] other.
[time=2237] Then I took your father Abraham, verse three, from beyond the river and led him through all the land of Canaan and multiplied his descendants and gave him Isaac.
[time=2246] To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau and to Esau I gave Mount Sarah to possess it, but Jacob
[time=2252] and his sons went down to Egypt.
[time=2255] Then I sent Moses and Aaron and I plagued Egypt.
[time=2259] Remember the plagues?
[time=2260] Remember Moses coming to deliver God at work there?
[time=2263] I sent Moses and Aaron.
[time=2264] Then I plagued Egypt by what I did and it's mixed and afterward I brought you out.
[time=2270] I brought you out.
[time=2271] I delivered you.
[time=2273] I freed you from bondage.
[time=2275] I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you came to the sea and Egypt pursued your fathers
[time=2281] with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea, but when they cried out to and the Israelites cried out to the Lord, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea
[time=2292] upon them and covered them and your own eyes.
[time=2296] You see that?
[time=2297] And your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt.
[time=2300] You saw it and you lived in the wilderness for a long time, referring there to the wandering
[time=2306] the 40 years where in their unfaithfulness they were lost in a sense and he guides them
[time=2312] and he feeds them out there.
[time=2316] You were in the wilderness for a long time.
[time=2317] Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan and they fought with you and I gave the eye, gave them into your hand and you took possession of their land when I destroyed them before you, then Balak, the son of Zippur, king of Moab, arose
[time=2334] and fought against Israel and he sent and summoned Balaam, the son of Beor to curse you.
[time=2341] But I didn't want him to curse you.
[time=2343] I was not willing to listen to Balaam so he had to bless you and I delivered you from
[time=2350] his hand.
[time=2351] You crossed the Jordan.
[time=2352] Don't miss that.
[time=2354] Remember the water?
[time=2354] What?
[time=2356] You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho and the citizens of Jericho fought against you
[time=2363] and the Amorite and the parasite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Gurgishite and the
[time=2369] Hivite and the Jebusite.
[time=2372] Thus I gave them into your hand, then I sent the Hornet before you and it drove out the
[time=2379] two kings of the Amorites from before you, but not by your sword or your bow.
[time=2385] I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities which you had not built and you
[time=2392] have lived in them.
[time=2393] You are eating of the vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.
[time=2400] 24, 1 to 13.
[time=2404] You know what?
[time=2405] There was a lot.
[time=2406] Joshua knew it.
[time=2408] He knew as this thing was winding down, he knew that there was a lot at stake.
[time=2414] And you know what my friends, as I look out at you this morning and as I see you in the midst of the lives that you live, and as I think about the situations that you and I
[time=2423] face and encounter, when I think of what God has called us to, high school students and young adults and moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas, when I look at the family of God, I realize that there is so much at stake and it's time progresses.
[time=2441] These are the kinds of words and these are the kinds of decisions.
[time=2446] These are the kinds of choices that you and I are going to have to make.
[time=2451] Joshua knew that and so he lays all of this out and here it comes.
[time=2457] Verses 14 and 15.
[time=2460] He just says it straight and he just puts it all up there on the table and says, "Hey, who are you going to be?" Now therefore, in light of all of that, when you think back and when you remember all that he did and all that he brought you through, now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and truth and put away the God's little G, self, materialism, pleasure
[time=2485] outside of God's design, put away the God's which your fathers serve beyond the river and in Egypt and serve the Lord.
[time=2494] Now you know what, my friends, God is a God, we've talked about this, who always gives you and I what, choice.
[time=2503] He's not about puppets, he's not about being where he is and punching divine buttons to
[time=2509] just get you to do what he want, no, he's going to give you and I choice.
[time=2515] So Joshua looks at the people and says, "Here you go." If it is, you know what, if having looked back on all of that, and I say this to you this morning, if having looked back on all of that, if it is disagreeable in your sight
[time=2531] to serve the Lord, if you don't want to serve the Lord, don't.
[time=2538] Don't do it, thank you.
[time=2543] Someone who's heard that word before.
[time=2547] If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves today whom
[time=2554] you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the river
[time=2560] or the gods of the Amorites and whose land you are living, either way, choose.
[time=2566] But as for me, say it with me, in my house we will serve the Lord.
[time=2576] But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
[time=2581] We will do everything we can with God's help to put away selfish ambition, self idolatry.
[time=2587] We're going to do everything we can in our house to put away materialism and the pursuit
[time=2593] of stuff.
[time=2595] We're going to do everything we can with God's help to stay within the God-ordained parameters
[time=2601] of God-honoring pleasure and move away from what society and culture call every young boy and girl and man and woman in this room to.
[time=2612] As for me and my house, we will honor and we will follow and we will serve our faithful
[time=2618] God.
[time=2619] And I just want to ask you today, how about you?
[time=2624] I hope you've been willing, I hope you've been willing today to remember, to look back.
[time=2629] I hope it's Joshua and the people of God have looked back.
[time=2633] I hope you, like me, I have been all week, I've been inspired all over again at how he
[time=2639] moves and how he works and how he speaks into our lives, how he saves and redeems and transforms,
[time=2645] how he helps and how he guides and how he watches and protects.
[time=2651] And I just got to ask you, as for you and your house, you know, there's some men in
[time=2657] this room this morning.
[time=2658] You know what?
[time=2659] There are some young men in this room and you don't even have a house yet.
[time=2664] You're getting there.
[time=2666] You don't have a wife, no kids yet, but you're a young man and you might be 13, you might be 22.
[time=2672] It doesn't matter.
[time=2673] Someday, someday you might have a house.
[time=2677] Someday you may have the privilege of caring for your bride.
[time=2681] Someday you may have a couple, two, three, four, five, six, however many kids.
[time=2687] And I'm asking you young men, who are you going to serve?
[time=2692] How are you going to lead?
[time=2695] Many of you men in the room today, you have a spouse.
[time=2699] She might be sitting next to you.
[time=2700] She might not be.
[time=2701] You've got kids.
[time=2702] You've got a home.
[time=2703] As for me in my home, as for me in my family, as for me in those that God has allotted to
[time=2709] my care, we will serve the Lord.
[time=2711] How are you doing?
[time=2714] You know what?
[time=2715] It's so, really, it's simple in a way because when you look back at the people of Israel,
[time=2721] if you looked at a father in that culture and you asked the question, how would that father in that day lead his family, love his wife, serve his children in such a way
[time=2732] that they would be a God-honoring household?
[time=2735] You know what they would do?
[time=2737] And you can just go back here and just read about it.
[time=2739] They would gather, they would make it a great priority to gather with the family of God,
[time=2747] with the nation.
[time=2748] They would, on a regular basis, they would meet.
[time=2752] We get the privilege of doing that here on a Sunday morning, on a Wednesday night.
[time=2757] We do it in smaller community settings as well, but in this setting, 9 o'clock, 1045.
[time=2764] How are you doing on that?
[time=2767] Men, some of you ladies in the room have responsibilities and opportunities with kids
[time=2774] and there, maybe there isn't a husband.
[time=2777] Some of you guys are on your own who, however God has orchestrated that, those of you leading,
[time=2785] is there a deep devotion in you together to be together and to receive the encouragement
[time=2791] that comes when we praise them together and when we study God's word together and when
[time=2797] we pray together, these guys in this day, those who were serving the Lord, those whose
[time=2803] homes were devoted to Him, you know what else they would do?
[time=2806] Go to Deuteronomy 6.
[time=2807] They would read the Scriptures to their kids.
[time=2812] They would read them and they would explain them and they would illustrate them.
[time=2817] They would articulate the truth of the Scriptures.
[time=2820] They would deposit it into the hearts and lives of their kids.
[time=2823] And not just once a day, not just once a week, excuse me, every day of every week on a consistent
[time=2829] morning, noon and night basis.
[time=2832] And let me just remind you today, your kids are getting consistent deposits of a whole bunch of stuff into their hearts and minds, morning, noon and night.
[time=2841] Why wouldn't you combat that?
[time=2844] Dads, moms, they would gather together.
[time=2852] They would read and explain and spend time in the Scriptures together.
[time=2855] And it doesn't take a masters of divinity.
[time=2858] You don't have to be able to stand here and do this to read the Bible to your kids and
[time=2865] help them understand the great life-changing truth of God's word.
[time=2869] You know what else we should be doing?
[time=2871] Well, it says it right here.
[time=2872] As for me and my house, we will, what, serve?
[time=2875] Mom and Dad, how are you doing on serving with your kids, in front of your kids?
[time=2882] How are you at giving of your time and your talent and your treasure inside and outside
[time=2888] these four walls?
[time=2891] If you're going to say, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." I mean, I just wanted to give you some practical things to consider.
[time=2899] I'm going to ask Janice and Doug and Corbin if they'd come.
[time=2904] And as they come, I just want to tell you this.
[time=2907] This is so, I almost don't want to do this.
[time=2911] I almost don't want to show you this.
[time=2914] I mean, there's a part of me that wants to just keep this from you, but I can't.
[time=2919] I just, I got to just tell you the truth here.
[time=2923] Joshua and all these people, you all just saw it.
[time=2930] They looked back on all that they had experienced.
[time=2935] God even said to them, "You saw it with your own, what?" Eyes.
[time=2940] And to go from Joshua and this incredible story of God's faithfulness and the work of his
[time=2947] hand in the lives of these people.
[time=2950] And then to turn your, anybody still have their Bible open, just turn your page.
[time=2954] What comes after Joshua?
[time=2957] Judges.
[time=2958] Now watch this.
[time=2963] Just watch.
[time=2966] Judges 2, 6, when Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel, went each to his
[time=2972] inheritance to possess the land.
[time=2974] People served the Lord, all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who survived
[time=2980] Joshua.
[time=2981] Joshua's contemporaries who lived past him, who had seen, there it is again, who had seen
[time=2987] all the great work of the Lord which he had done for Israel.
[time=2991] And then Joshua, the son of none, the servant of the Lord died at the age of 110.
[time=2998] And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath, Harris and the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gash.
[time=3004] And here you go, it's just like it's just the verse I don't want to read, but there it is.
[time=3009] And all that generation, Joshua's, also were gathered to their fathers.
[time=3015] They died.
[time=3016] And there arose another generation after them, who did not know the Lord.
[time=3031] And my friends, they didn't, they didn't just not know the Lord, they hadn't even, they
[time=3038] hadn't even heard about it.
[time=3043] How does that happen?
[time=3048] How do you see all that?
[time=3050] How do you go through all of that and not tell your kids and not share the truth and
[time=3058] not stand up and every moment of every day that God gives you, share that with those
[time=3064] He's given you to love and to lead.
[time=3067] And I don't want that to happen to you, and I don't want it to happen to me.
[time=3073] I want it to be that for you and for me, for our homes, that we would be, when you serve the Lord, that doesn't happen.
[time=3084] And you forget about Him, when you go your own way, and when you forget to tell the stories, and when you forget to deposit love and truth and life into those who come after you, wow,
[time=3096] they didn't even know Him.
[time=3099] I hope you'll choose to serve.
[time=3102] Doug and Janice are going to sing, and I'd just pray you'd be encouraged, just listen
[time=3118] to the music of God's music of God's music of God's music of God's music of God's music
[time=3505] deeply devoted to you because of who you are and because of your great faithfulness great as thy
[time=3513] faithfulness oh God your mercies are new every morning and we are so very thankful for that God
[time=3522] be with us as we go
[time=3535] (upbeat music)
