[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=55] and on earth."
[time=62] Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=68] of the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=78] Teaching them to observe all I have to command you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=89] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=102] Two weeks ago we discussed how worship and sacrifice are inseparable, and we used this visual image to show how few thousand years ago how they used an altar to when they went
[time=114] to worship God they needed a sacrifice, and this is where they did that.
[time=119] Last week we experienced, most of us probably felt somewhat uncomfortable, a little awkward
[time=125] when we put a live animal up here and took it to the brink of helping us understand and
[time=131] feel, and feel, wasn't a nihilist thing, it was a feel to feel what our sin does and the cost of our transgressions and what it cost Jesus, and that was the ultimate sacrifice.
[time=142] Well, this week we are going to move to the worship side of the equation and maybe talk about what that could be like and how that relates to sacrifice.
[time=153] For this morning worship we are going to define it as intimacy, and I have a suspicion that
[time=159] God defines intimacy by if he has to compete with something in our life, then our intimacy
[time=166] is destroyed with him.
[time=168] So we have an intimate relationship with him when he has no competition in our life.
[time=172] There's nothing we bring to that most holy place that competes with God.
[time=177] So what are the things that we tend to bring into the most holy place, though?
[time=181] Even holy things are good things that our hands make unholy that compete with him.
[time=187] I have a bag of some things that maybe represent what some of those are.
[time=192] I think there's a couple obvious ones, a checkbook, maybe how we use our money or what we don't
[time=200] do with our money sometimes competes with God.
[time=205] I think we have time issues that what we do with our time or what we don't do with our time, what our calendar looks like, maybe he would like us to begin doing things that we just don't have time for, it's just not a priority.
[time=217] So sometimes to worship God, to experience His intimacy, we need to sacrifice some of
[time=223] our priorities to take on God's priorities.
[time=227] What else do we have in here?
[time=229] Entertainment.
[time=230] I'm glad he had one of my favorite movies, DVDs.
[time=232] It's also include music, books, magazines, things we do for entertainment.
[time=238] Maybe good things are not sin, but it's competing with God.
[time=244] And so from God's perspective, intimacy is being destroyed because He's competing with
[time=250] our need for entertainment.
[time=254] Sports.
[time=255] I love sports.
[time=256] I've learned a lot about life through sports, but a preoccupation with sports, making being
[time=263] obsessed with a certain team or a certain sport can lead us to put this sport in the place
[time=270] of God and He has to compete with it.
[time=273] Those sports could be one of those things.
[time=277] Here's my diploma from Purdue University.
[time=279] I got it.
[time=280] Right here.
[time=281] See?
[time=282] It's even signed.
[time=284] This represents my ambitions, my dreams.
[time=288] And so sometimes our dreams and the ambitions we have in life and those desires, those things we want to do or want to accomplish or want to go, maybe that direction, which is a good thing.
[time=299] Many people go down that road, but God is saying for you and who you are in me, I may want
[time=306] you to go this direction.
[time=307] So these things right here start competing with what I want you to do.
[time=313] And so this maybe represents those dreams and desires.
[time=317] And so yes, even this may need to be sacrificed for the cause of intimacy with God, closeness
[time=323] with Him.
[time=324] How about internet?
[time=329] Internets can be a really powerful tool and some of us use it for business all the time.
[time=333] But sometimes where we go, the time we spend on the internet, the purpose of why we go
[time=341] to the internet competes with God and it's not pleasing to God.
[time=347] So maybe this is something we need to sacrifice because worship and sacrifice are inseparable.
[time=352] Faith is a closeness, the intimacy with God.
[time=356] And sometimes we need to sacrifice things to experience that in the most holy place.
[time=362] And this last one, I hate this one and Mitch is going to talk about this a little bit, this file folder with information in here.
[time=370] Maybe this has a name on it and it represents somebody in my life, somebody in my past.
[time=377] And what I have in here is just the things they've said, the things they've done to me,
[time=383] the ways they betrayed me, the ways they hurt me, the ways they've lied and deceived me, how I've been hurt by it, and I'm keeping a record.
[time=391] And I'm holding on to this.
[time=394] And this allows me to stay angry at them.
[time=397] This allows me to be bitter.
[time=398] This gives me the right to put them down.
[time=401] And for me to hold on to this anger, to hold on to these things and not forgive and to
[time=407] not let go, competes with God.
[time=413] The ultimate sacrifice here, Jesus, gave his life so that the file folder that God has
[time=421] is empty on me.
[time=424] And so maybe this competes with my intimacy with God and maybe something like this, letting
[time=431] go needs to kind of be sacrificed.
[time=437] These represent just some things that I think we as church typically bring to the most holy
[time=444] place and hang on to and just refuse to let go.
[time=448] And yet these things may be what we need to really experience a worshipful experience to live life with intimacy with God.
[time=457] Would you pray with me?
[time=459] Heavenly Father, I want to lift up you and worship you for you or a whole.
[time=467] You created us.
[time=468] We are your creation.
[time=469] You came down and initiated a relationship with us.
[time=475] And Lord, you bless us with certain things.
[time=476] And sometimes we take these things and just hold on to them.
[time=480] And we put these in competition with you.
[time=483] Please show us what those are in our lives.
[time=488] Is it money?
[time=489] Is it my time?
[time=492] Do I have desires that you don't want me to do?
[time=495] Or is it someone?
[time=496] There's someone I just need to forgive and let go and look to you to restore that relationship.
[time=504] Father, we lift all these things to you.
[time=507] Intimacy with you is the most important thing in my life.
[time=511] I know that.
[time=512] Help me to experience that.
[time=515] Jesus, we pray all these things in your name.
[time=518] My Father, I adore you more than anything my heart could wish for you.
[time=536] I just want you and Jesus, my beloved, save your everything I have, I owe to you.
[time=547] I owe it all to you, and angels come and adore you, and we, your children, worship you.
[time=573] You are my world, you are my God, and I lay down my life for you.
[time=586] I love my world, the one I love, the one who couldn't entertain your plan.
[time=611] Everything I have, I give to you, my Lord, the one I live for.
[time=618] I live for you, and all my days are gifts from you.
[time=625] I pray I'd use the masks you want me to, use them for you.
[time=634] And angels come and adore you, and we, your children, worship you.
[time=655] You are my love, you are my God, and I lay down my life for you.
[time=668] You are my Lord, the one I love, the one who couldn't entertain your plan.
[time=679] You are my world, you are my God, and I lay down my life for you.
[time=691] You are my Lord, the one I love, the one who couldn't entertain your plan.
[time=708] I think the question Dave's asking is God, your world, and is he your Lord of absolutely
[time=715] everything?
[time=716] That's a question I'm going to keep asking myself, and a question I'll keep encouraging you to ask of yourself, Mitch, would you come and share with us, please?
[time=729] Thank you, Corbin, thank you, Tanya, thank you, team.
[time=734] And thank you for coming here today, I got a question for you.
[time=737] I'd like you to raise your hand if you've ever had somebody wrong you and you had the
[time=746] opportunity to forgive them, raise your hand, raise them high, I want you to look around
[time=752] at people who have their hands down because that's what someone in denial looks like.
[time=758] Each of us have had people wrong us.
[time=761] They have desired life apart from God and we were the object of that, and we have an opportunity to either hold on or to let go.
[time=772] I went to the Indy 500 for my 35th time this May, and I was reminded of the 10th anniversary
[time=782] of one of my best friend's death, Scott Brayton who had won back-to-back pole positions and was the sitting pole setter of that particular race was test driving a vehicle, a race car
[time=793] from his team, and because it had a faulty tire after about 20 laps it disintegrated and
[time=800] began like this metal on ice type of movement and no matter how tightly he held on to the
[time=807] wheel of that car because one of the tires was faulty, he was going to hit the wall and
[time=814] he spun twice and he hit the wall at over 200 miles an hour and was killed instantly.
[time=821] Jesus likened withholding forgiveness to a prison, and the irony is that the one who
[time=830] is in prison is me, the one withholding that forgiveness.
[time=835] And no matter how tightly we hold on to the control wheel of our lives, if we don't let
[time=843] go of what we're going to see, the four prison walls of withholding forgiveness, we will not experience freedom.
[time=850] No matter how tightly my friend Scott held on to the wheel of his car, because one wheel
[time=857] was bad because one prison wall was there, he was in a prison cell that had a death sentence.
[time=867] With withholding forgiveness, no matter how tightly we hold on to the control wheel of our lives, if we don't let go of what we're going to see all four prison walls of withholding forgiveness, we will not experience freedom in our lives.
[time=881] We will be the one inside the prison cell.
[time=885] So I'd like you to stand and we're going to read a parable on how Jesus described this
[time=891] on how Jesus described this.
[time=893] Now I want to set the stage for you.
[time=895] A parable is a spiritual truth thrown alongside an earthly one and each parable has scholars think one, two or three movements or points.
[time=903] I think this one might have three and we're going to apply those three to each of the four prison walls that happen when we withhold forgiveness.
[time=910] And again, the irony is that we're the ones who are in prison, not the original offender.
[time=915] And Peter asked Jesus a question, that's what's going to prompt this, Jesus has just finished with the famous reconciliation passage in Matthew 18.
[time=923] And what we learn here is that forgiveness always precedes reconciliation.
[time=928] So Jesus is going to talk about a prerequisite of reconciliation.
[time=932] Now what we're going to talk about today is not reconciliation.
[time=936] We're not talking about reconciliation.
[time=938] There is so much wisdom that needs to go into that and how that's done that that's a whole other message.
[time=944] What we're talking about today is a prerequisite to reconciliation and that is forgiveness.
[time=951] So there was this rabbinical tradition that if somebody was a repeat offender with me, I could hold a grudge.
[time=957] That's the teaching.
[time=958] I could hold on to the grudge and not let go of the four prison walls of unforgiveness.
[time=966] And so that sparks Peter's question.
[time=967] So here it comes.
[time=969] We're reading Matthew 18, Jesus is this parable from Matthew 18 21 through 35.
[time=975] Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me?
[time=981] How about seven?" This answered, "I tell you not seven times, but 77 times or 70 times seven.
[time=991] Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants." As he began the settlement, a man who owed him 10,000 talents was brought to him.
[time=1002] Since he was not able to pay the master order that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
[time=1008] The servant fell on his knees before him, "Be patient with me, he beg, and I will pay back everything." The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt, and let him go.
[time=1024] But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him 100 denieri.
[time=1029] He grabbed him and began to choke him, "Pay back what you owe me," he demanded.
[time=1035] His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, "Be patient with me, I will pay you back."
[time=1041] After he refused, instead he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could
[time=1047] pay the debt.
[time=1049] When the other servant saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened.
[time=1057] Then the master called the servant in, "You wicked servant," he said, "I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
[time=1065] Since you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you, an anger as master turned
[time=1072] him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed."
[time=1078] And here's probably the most sobering statement in all of Scripture.
[time=1083] This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from
[time=1091] your heart.
[time=1093] Let's pray.
[time=1096] And now, God, as we open your word and as we look at your actual words, when you were here in the flesh, may your power of your spirit who is alive in here right now connect
[time=1108] with the spirit of each person here.
[time=1113] God, may the words be yours and not mine.
[time=1115] In Jesus' name, amen, may be seated.
[time=1119] Well, let's talk about, real quickly, the three movements or points of this parable.
[time=1126] And then we're going to apply them to the four prison walls of unforgiveness, holding
[time=1133] on.
[time=1134] First, we have the king and the parable.
[time=1139] And Jesus basically is using the king as a character for God.
[time=1145] And Jesus says he was owed 10,000 talents.
[time=1148] A talent was 15 years' wages.
[time=1151] So 15 times 10,000, I think it's 150,000 years' wages.
[time=1156] Jesus just picked the biggest number his listeners have ever heard.
[time=1159] Very important to get that.
[time=1161] They've never heard it.
[time=1162] Just extrapolate it today and it's billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[time=1171] And it's what we do, the guy who owed the debt, the biggest debt that no one could ever pay back, the parable's really clear.
[time=1178] He says, I'll pay you back.
[time=1180] And that's what we do to God.
[time=1181] I'll pay you back with good deeds.
[time=1183] God, oh, I'll make all these rights wrong.
[time=1185] I'll do it.
[time=1189] But forgiveness is in the heart of the king and he pays the debt and he frees the guy
[time=1199] from the biggest debt and he frees you and me from the biggest debt anyone has ever incurred vertically with God.
[time=1209] You and I have had the biggest debt ever incurred paid by another and that's Christ.
[time=1216] So when I'm in Christ, I have his heart.
[time=1219] If I haven't surrendered the will of my life to Christ and I really haven't been forgiven.
[time=1225] Page two, kind of point two, movement two.
[time=1229] The guy who's owed the same guy who was forgiven goes out and he's got this guy who owes him a hundred in an area, a hundred days wages, a little bitty amount and he grabs the guy
[time=1242] and chokes him.
[time=1243] Isn't that funny?
[time=1244] He's holding on.
[time=1245] He's choking him and he says, you pay me back.
[time=1247] And the guy does the same thing.
[time=1248] He falls down.
[time=1249] He begs.
[time=1250] He says, hey, I'll pay you back.
[time=1251] I will, I will.
[time=1252] He says, forget it.
[time=1253] You're in prison.
[time=1255] And then that's point two.
[time=1258] We do that sometimes, you know.
[time=1261] We have the biggest debt ever incurred paid by Christ.
[time=1266] And then we go out and we hold on to relatively little bitty debts and horizontally in relationship
[time=1273] with other people.
[time=1274] That makes sense.
[time=1277] And really whatever it is, whatever it is, if it's abuse and I know your stories, I've sat in offices with you.
[time=1284] I know your stories of being abused, of women being abused by their fathers, of people stealing
[time=1290] from you, of whatever it is, in comparison to the debt that has been paid by Christ,
[time=1297] it's horizontal.
[time=1298] It's small.
[time=1299] It's little bitty.
[time=1300] And I found that I can let go when I recognize the weight of my sin and the weight and the
[time=1308] enormity of the debt that's been paid by Christ for me, it makes it so much easier if I'm in tune with that to let go horizontally in little bitty debts in relationships.
[time=1320] I have to come back again where the vertical intersects with the horizontal and recognize that I've been forgiven as big as it gets.
[time=1327] And therefore Christ in me, I can release and forgive and let go of these little bitty
[time=1333] debts.
[time=1334] But that's now what happens all the time.
[time=1336] And so Jesus comes back with the third part.
[time=1339] And He says that God found out about it, the King found out about what this guy did.
[time=1345] And He said if that's the case, you're out.
[time=1349] Because you can't be forgiven that big debt and feel that and experience that and to be
[time=1356] characterized and known by someone who holds on to little bitty debts, debts and horizontal
[time=1362] relationships with others.
[time=1363] And so what we're going to see here, we're going to look at four prison walls.
[time=1367] That happens, that come around me when I hold on to each of the four prison walls and with hold forgiveness.
[time=1373] And in order to forgive, I need to let go.
[time=1376] Forgiveness means literally to let go.
[time=1379] So I either hold on or I let go to each of these four prison walls.
[time=1383] I want you to begin to think of the debt horizontally that you're holding on to.
[time=1390] Maybe you've been abused, maybe somebody has stolen something from you, maybe you've been taken advantage of.
[time=1396] You know, maybe it's a relational thing that's gone on on the way to church with someone you're sitting beside.
[time=1401] But I want you to identify that right now and we're going to see, do we hold on or do we let go and how do we do that?
[time=1408] Now again, I'm talking about a heart condition today.
[time=1412] I'm not talking about reconciliation, wisdom.
[time=1414] I want to say it again because too many people have been hurt by Christians who do not handle reconciliation in a godly manner and in a humble manner.
[time=1423] I'm strictly talking about what goes on in your heart today with letting go.
[time=1428] Let's look at the first prison wall.
[time=1429] The first one is revenge.
[time=1432] Revenge if you want to write it down is retaliation and it occurs usually in three ways.
[time=1439] Greater, you did X to me, I'm going to do two times X to you.
[time=1444] The same, you did X to me, I'll do X to you.
[time=1448] Or kind of what tends to be the Christian way, lesser, you did X to me, I'll do half of X to you because I'm a Christian.
[time=1456] And I talk with someone afterwards and this is kind of what we'll talk about in the fourth prison wall but there's also that kind of deal where you just flee totally and you just
[time=1466] protect yourself and it's from a heart of revenge.
[time=1469] I'll get you back because you'll never see me again.
[time=1474] Well let's see how Jesus addressed this.
[time=1475] It's Matthew 5 verses 38 through 42, Matthew 5 verses 38 through 42 in the Sermon on the
[time=1481] Mount.
[time=1482] Jesus says, "You've heard that it was said an eye for eye and tooth for tooth, pay back." This was the rabbinical interpretation of the time the Bible has never been about paying back with a heart that wants to pay back.
[time=1495] But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.
[time=1496] If someone strikes you on the right cheek, let me just read it all now and talk about it.
[time=1501] If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other, also.
[time=1504] And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
[time=1508] If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles, give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
[time=1518] Translated, do not hold on, let go.
[time=1520] This is interesting.
[time=1521] To slap somebody on the right cheek 2,000 years ago and even today, I have to use the back of my right hand and we use the same terminology today for an insult.
[time=1530] That was a backhanded comment and that's what he's talking about.
[time=1533] When you're insulted, turn the other cheek, let it go, don't hold on.
[time=1537] And it's really kind of a picture here I see of my time, talent, and treasures and how I let go.
[time=1542] When I'm wronged, somebody has dinged my time, talent, and treasures.
[time=1546] The overall resources of my life is comprised by my time, my talent, and my treasures.
[time=1551] When someone insults me, they're insulting the unique person of who I am that God's designed me to be in his image, my talent, that's the unique person of who I am.
[time=1560] And Jesus says, let go, no revenge, let go, don't hold on, let go.
[time=1566] The tunic and the cloak, in most cases, in Palestine 2,000 years ago, were the only treasures
[time=1572] they had.
[time=1573] That was their only treasured resource, their only physical financial resource were their clothes.
[time=1579] Jesus said to someone who wants to sue you and take all your money.
[time=1584] Let go, don't hold on, let go, let go of revenge, don't retaliate, don't retaliate.
[time=1594] And finally, he talks about time.
[time=1597] 2,000 years ago, a Roman soldier could stop anybody and say, I want your time, you're going to take these goods for a mile on official business on behalf of the government.
[time=1607] And Jesus said, if that happened to you, if somebody dings your time, I know you're required to go one mile, go two.
[time=1615] Don't seek revenge, don't try to get the guy when he turns his back, go two.
[time=1621] When someone dings my time, talent and treasures, Jesus says, let go of revenge, don't hold on to the prison wall of revenge.
[time=1628] Don't do things with revenge, with a heart of revenge, lesser, greater, the same, flee, whatever it is, don't do it, but let go.
[time=1636] Paul said it this way, in Romans 12, 19 through 21, now he proceeded it with reconciliation.
[time=1641] He says, you know, if at all possible, as far as it depends on you, because it takes two, reconcile, but here's the prerequisite to reconciliation, forgiveness always proceeds
[time=1651] reconciliation, but reconciliation does not always follow forgiveness because reconciliation takes two.
[time=1657] Here's what Paul says, do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God.
[time=1663] See, we move out of the vertical component that I've been forgiven the greatest debt
[time=1669] ever incurred when we seek revenge.
[time=1672] He's saying, come back and remember that, and leave room for God.
[time=1677] So don't take revenge, but leave room for God's wrath, for it's written, in his mind to avenge, I will repay says the Lord.
[time=1683] Verse 20.
[time=1684] On the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him if he is thirsty, give him something to drink, and doing this you will heed burning coals on his head.
[time=1691] Verse 21, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[time=1695] This is going to tie into the fourth prison wall, but Jesus says, don't, and Paul said, don't do, don't hold on to revenge, but let go.
[time=1703] And in fact, you're going to let go so much that something radical on the positive side is going to happen.
[time=1708] You know, this is a reference to the greatest horizontal commandment.
[time=1711] The greatest vertical commandment is to love God with all my heart.
[time=1714] Greatest horizontal commandment, look what context is in.
[time=1717] This is amazing.
[time=1718] Leviticus 19 18, Leviticus 19 18.
[time=1721] Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people.
[time=1725] See holding onto a grudge to repeat a fender?
[time=1728] The rabbis had lost their way from what the word said.
[time=1732] Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1737] I am the Lord, where the vertical intersects with the horizontal is where we can let go.
[time=1742] We have to come to God to do it.
[time=1747] Guy walked into my office, and he's a little bit ADHD, ADHD.
[time=1754] And he said, dude, I've got to tell you what happened.
[time=1756] He's a serious man.
[time=1758] I said, go ahead.
[time=1759] He goes, well, you know, in I-69 where he intersects with 14 and people trying to get on and get off, and everybody know that where it's real close there.
[time=1765] It's really easy to get caught up in something.
[time=1767] He goes, guy, cut me off.
[time=1769] Well, it took me two miles to catch up with him.
[time=1771] And when I caught up with him, I gave him the universal gesture and I cut him off.
[time=1775] I said, well, what seems to be the problem?
[time=1777] There was a state trooper sitting right there.
[time=1780] I said, I've had some of things like that happen to me.
[time=1783] I said, well, what'd he say?
[time=1787] He said, I don't care what happened two miles ago.
[time=1789] You still committed this act.
[time=1793] Jesus is saying, God doesn't care what happened two miles ago in your life in the past.
[time=1801] Do not hold on to the prison wall of revenge.
[time=1805] Don't do greater.
[time=1806] Don't do the same.
[time=1807] Don't do lesser.
[time=1808] Don't protect yourself.
[time=1809] But let go.
[time=1811] Let go and let God work in their lives.
[time=1816] And what about you?
[time=1819] What the person who's wronged you, who's dinged your time, your talent, your treasures, who sinned against you, who's desired life apart from God and you are the object, today can
[time=1828] you honestly say that you let go of revenge or are you holding on in your heart to some
[time=1835] kind of revenge?
[time=1838] Ironically, no matter how tightly we hold on to the control wheel of our lives, if just one of these four prison walls we're still holding on to, we will experience relational wreckage.
[time=1850] We will be in a prison cell with a death sentence.
[time=1857] Number two.
[time=1859] Prison wall number two is resentment.
[time=1863] Revenge is retaliation.
[time=1864] Resentment is bitterness.
[time=1866] It's a poison of the heart.
[time=1869] Hubert Humphrey said that bitterness or resentment is like drinking poison and expecting my enemy
[time=1875] to die.
[time=1876] Again, the irony is I'm the one who's in prison when I withhold forgiveness.
[time=1881] Look how Paul says that in Ephesians 4, 31 and 32.
[time=1885] Get rid of all bitterness.
[time=1888] Get rid of all resentment.
[time=1891] Not some.
[time=1892] All.
[time=1893] Let go of all.
[time=1894] Rage and anger, brawling and slander along with every form of malice.
[time=1897] Peter said we should be done with that once and for all when we're believers.
[time=1900] Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, letting go, just as in Christ God forgave you, where the vertical meets the horizontal.
[time=1909] I have been let go from the biggest dead ever incurred, and therefore I should let go of
[time=1915] the little bitty horizontal relational deaths, and no matter how big they are, their little bitty compared to what I've been let go in Christ.
[time=1925] That is so clear.
[time=1926] Look at what a Job's friend says in Job 36, 13.
[time=1930] This is so interesting.
[time=1931] The godless in heart, harbor resentment.
[time=1936] Even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.
[time=1938] Listen, think about that.
[time=1940] The godless in heart, harbor resentment, harbor, hold on.
[time=1945] The godless in heart, hold on to the prison wall of resentment, this poison of this heart,
[time=1951] the bitterness.
[time=1953] So again, when I can't forgive or let go horizontally, little bitty deaths in relationships, no
[time=1962] matter how big they are, their little bitty in comparison to this, I find that when I
[time=1968] can't let go, it's because I have not come back, dialed in to the weight of my own sin and the big debt that I was forgiven.
[time=1976] It's a direct correlation.
[time=1977] I got to come back to where the vertical meets the horizontal in order to let go of revenge and to let go of resentment.
[time=1986] Last family vacation last July, we went to California, and we were at a Disney park,
[time=1992] and at this particular Disney park they had kind of a static parade where everybody came to a circle, they did the parade in front of you kind of a thing, and a little concert, a little music and all kinds of animated figures, and then you leave.
[time=2004] Well, Haley, our fourth daughter, was a year and a half old, and so we had a stroller full of everything that could fit in a minivan, not just the back of the minivan, but the whole minivan.
[time=2014] It's really bumming me, in fact, I need to let go of that right now.
[time=2020] Susan, because of that, took out her purse and set it on a bench where we were sitting, and we fed Haley during that time.
[time=2027] We walked about five minutes away to the next ride where we're going to go on, and Susan looked at me and said, "Did you take my purse?" Well, I tease sometimes, and I hide things because she misplaces them, and she needs
[time=2044] to let go of that, and she realized it wasn't me, and she ran back to where it was.
[time=2051] Well, about five minutes have gone by, and she hadn't come back, so I ran, and here's what I found out.
[time=2055] She took the girls and ran over there, and Susan had done what you and I would do.
[time=2057] She went to the nearest vendor, Disney vendor, and said, "Has somebody turned into a purse?" And the guy turned white, his facial expression, so there's a problem, and he says, "Yes, they did." But when this guy returned it, he turned to a lady behind him and said, "Oh, is this yours?" And she said, "Yes." And we said, "What'd she look like?" So resentment toward this lady, who whatever color hair she had in her yellow shirt, just
[time=2085] started fighting and poisoning my soul.
[time=2088] It wasn't so much that Susan's purse was gone, and all the cash that was in it.
[time=2093] But here's what I found out, and this is what really did it for me.
[time=2096] We stopped Susan's phone immediately.
[time=2098] It is amazing.
[time=2099] Verizon must have this happen all the time.
[time=2100] I stopped the phone in like 30 seconds, and with no problem of turning it back on.
[time=2106] But in the meantime, Megan was calling it all the time as if that person was in some restroom stall that it was going to be going off the whole time, you know?
[time=2114] Well, the purse got returned.
[time=2117] Somebody found it sitting on a table.
[time=2120] And everything was in it except Susan's phone, I forget, it's okay, of course less.
[time=2125] Her cash, that made me mad, but this made me really mad.
[time=2128] Every cent that Kelsey had in cash, hidden in this little compartment in the purse, was
[time=2135] stolen.
[time=2136] And the fact that that person stole my little baby's money just made me mad.
[time=2143] And resentment poisoned my soul until this.
[time=2148] That night I couldn't hold on any longer because it was killing me inside.
[time=2153] A little piece of me was dying inside.
[time=2156] And I finally prayed to God, I want to let go.
[time=2159] And it didn't quite happen for me until I recognized the weight of my own sin.
[time=2166] And the way I did that, in that particular situation and maybe you need to do this, is I saw, I wanted to find out where in my sin am I like that person.
[time=2174] Where in my life would I take advantage of an opportunity given me that might be wrong?
[time=2178] Would I steal a towel from a hotel room?
[time=2181] If the IRS sent me a letter and said, "We've made an error, and here's a million dollars.
[time=2187] Have a nice day, would I take it?" Of course I would.
[time=2191] So I started thinking about that.
[time=2194] And it wasn't until, again, I came back where the Virgo meets the horizontal.
[time=2197] I came back and realized the weight of my own sin and how I'm capable of maybe not doing what she did, but I can do something just as bad.
[time=2205] And I was able to let go.
[time=2207] What about you?
[time=2210] Maybe you're holding on to resentment.
[time=2212] Maybe it's abuse by your father, you know?
[time=2213] I know.
[time=2214] I know that's in this room.
[time=2216] It's sexual abuse.
[time=2221] Can you begin to let go of resentment and not hold on to this prison wall of unforgiveness
[time=2228] by recognizing the weight of your sin and the debt that was paid for you?
[time=2234] Another imagery that's really helped me here is that if you were abused, if you were wronged in any fashion, I've been asked so many times what was God doing sitting idly by watching that happen.
[time=2246] I think Christ gives us a different perspective.
[time=2250] I think Christ gives us perspective that he was being abused when I was abused.
[time=2255] He was being wronged when I was wrong.
[time=2257] He wasn't sitting idly by.
[time=2259] He was tortured with me.
[time=2266] We need to let go and not hold on to the prison wall of revenge, the prison wall of resentment and third, the prison wall of regret.
[time=2275] Regret is a thought that I could change the past.
[time=2280] This is big in my personality.
[time=2282] I think certain personalities really struggle with regret, opportunity costs and economics.
[time=2288] The thought that I could change the past, I wish I would have said, I wish I would have done.
[time=2294] If only this, then I would even be here.
[time=2298] Regret, it's big with me.
[time=2300] It happens to me in big things, but it happens to me and it might happen for you in living things.
[time=2306] I'm sensitive.
[time=2307] I don't know why, but I'm sensitive.
[time=2313] Sensitivity is this inverted pride, really, if you want to be honest about it.
[time=2318] If Susan or one of my girls or somebody I'm around, if they say something that kind of
[time=2325] hurts me, I got the regret thing I'm holding on to for quite a while.
[time=2330] I wish I wouldn't have said, I wish I wouldn't have done, because then they wouldn't have done that, and now I'm holding on.
[time=2338] Maybe it's that way for you.
[time=2341] I mean, it just happened to me this week.
[time=2345] David Robson and I were coaching a girls team of basketball in the Summer League in Ohio, and it was anybody here January 1st when I talked about my speeding ticket in Ohio?
[time=2355] Well, for me, that's been the gift that just keeps on giving.
[time=2359] I went to what's affectionately known now in Auburn as Kelly's license branch, and I got called up, and I wanted to renew my license, and this lady was really kind to me.
[time=2371] I had the opposite experience of what Kelly had, and she was really kind to me.
[time=2375] She said, "Heaven, I heard you on WBCL." I said, "It was probably my brother." No, it was you.
[time=2382] I said, "I've been on there a few times." She goes, "Yeah, you have three daughters, don't you?" I said, "Yeah, that's right, four." I said, "Can I renew my license?" Sure.
[time=2393] I like listening to you.
[time=2395] I said, "Thank you." She was so kind.
[time=2397] She had an over-inflated worth of me.
[time=2398] I can tell you that right now.
[time=2399] So she's going on, and she said, "Oh, looks at the people beside her.
[time=2403] There must be something wrong with my computer." It says that you need to take the Indiana driver's test before you can have your license renewed.
[time=2411] It's not funny.
[time=2415] So I respond by saying, "Well, I think I've only had a ticket once in like 18 years
[time=2421] after I got scared straight after driver's training and all those other things." So anyway, I said, "Only in 18 years." I said, "But it was in Ohio.
[time=2426] Oh, I'm sure that's not it.
[time=2428] It's got to be my computer." She hits it.
[time=2431] She hits the monitor.
[time=2432] She goes, "I'll go ask my manager, and here's what I see, and here." Well, I don't know, it might be how fast he was going over the speed limit.
[time=2442] That could add a lot to do with it.
[time=2444] I'll call.
[time=2445] Oh, she called, and that was it.
[time=2448] Well, she said, "Do you want to take the test now?" The driver's manuals are brand new.
[time=2452] They changed a lot of things, and they just came in today, and you can have the first one.
[time=2456] I said, "I'm not going to take it now.
[time=2457] I'll take it later." Well, my 16-year-old had to take the driver's test that week, so I just will remember for the rest of our lives.
[time=2464] When Megan took hers, I took mine, and we both passed.
[time=2467] Thank God.
[time=2469] So, I've been intimate with the Indiana driver's manual.
[time=2474] I get to this country road, intersection, by my house close to the school.
[time=2478] That's really important to this factor, what happened.
[time=2480] I'm gesturing to David, like this, and I said, "See, this is what the Indiana driver's manual
[time=2486] doesn't really quite talk about," because I'd shared this whole story with him.
[time=2489] I said, "Two people coming to the intersection at the same time at a two-way stop.
[time=2493] She's turning left.
[time=2494] I'm going straight.
[time=2495] I know.
[time=2496] David, did I get there first?
[time=2497] You got there first.
[time=2499] You got there first." I said, "Because you know, if she thinks she got here first, she really can go first, but nobody abides by it, and everybody's confused by it.
[time=2505] Two cars go by.
[time=2507] I go.
[time=2508] David, was I here first?
[time=2509] I go." As I look in the window, this lady's got her hands up gesturing me like this.
[time=2515] I put my window down, and I said, "Get your hands back on the 10-2 driving wheel position." I put my wheel out, "No, I didn't, but I wanted to." That's what I was thinking.
[time=2527] I knew the lady.
[time=2528] Yes, it was you.
[time=2531] No, it wasn't.
[time=2532] I knew the lady.
[time=2533] That really bothered me, because you know, I'm feeling now I was wronged, and regret set in.
[time=2538] I wish I would have just let her go first.
[time=2539] Why don't I just be Mr. Nice Guy all the time, and I don't have to worry about junk like this?
[time=2543] You know, and I'm doing this prayer thing, it's holding another talk, but I'm doing this prayer thing, and I get to the point where I just have to let go of it with God.
[time=2550] I finally reconciled with her on Saturday morning where I usually see her, and she tried to tell me it wasn't me, but when she told me her side of the story, it was me.
[time=2561] She just said, "I saw this guy gesturing, and I just gestured back.
[time=2564] She was being funny.
[time=2565] She wasn't really mad." All that because of regret, the thought that I could change the past.
[time=2570] Here's what Paul said about in Philippians 3, 13, and 14.
[time=2574] Paul said, "Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it, but one thing I do, forgetting what is behind, letting go of what is behind and strading toward what is ahead," verse 14, "I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called
[time=2591] me heavenward in Christ Jesus." Word is again in Christ vertically, horizontally, "I let go.
[time=2599] I let go of the thought I could change the past.
[time=2601] God doesn't even change the past.
[time=2602] I let go." Paul's specifically talking here about a proud religious sin in his life, and he said, "I just got to forget it.
[time=2609] I can't have regret.
[time=2610] I just got to let go.
[time=2612] Don't hold on to the prison wall of regret." I love how he says it in 2 Corinthians 7, 10.
[time=2619] In Corinthians 7, 10 says, "Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death." Feeling sorry about me leads to holding on to four prison walls and with holding forgiveness,
[time=2637] and that comes with a death sentence.
[time=2640] Just like my friend Scott, no matter how tightly he held on to the control wheel of his life, because one wheel was faulty because we hold on to one prison wall.
[time=2651] We have a death sentence.
[time=2653] But Godly sorrow in Christ, that leads to repentance, that leads to salvation, and there
[time=2660] is no regret.
[time=2661] I can let go because Christ let go of the biggest death ever incurred.
[time=2666] I can let go of these little bitty horizontal debts in relationships.
[time=2669] And what about you?
[time=2670] Can you do that?
[time=2671] Will you do that?
[time=2673] Are you holding on right now to regret?
[time=2677] Maybe you were abused, maybe you were taken advantage of, maybe somebody stole from you, maybe something minor with your spouse on the way to church today.
[time=2682] Can you let go of regret?
[time=2684] I wish I wouldn't have done this.
[time=2685] The thought that you could change the past, can you let go?
[time=2687] Will you let go?
[time=2688] Or will you hold on and be in prison?
[time=2691] Because the irony is the offender, the original offender is not who's in prison.
[time=2694] It's you, it's me.
[time=2697] Fourth prison wall.
[time=2698] We've got to let go of revenge.
[time=2704] This is what we normally do as Christians is we withhold a positive.
[time=2709] So we need to let go of resisting blessing, right, that down, resisting blessing.
[time=2717] This is not wishing one well before God and others, not wishing one well before God and others.
[time=2723] That's the ultimate goal of forgiveness.
[time=2725] To the end of the day, like Jesus said earlier in this passage in Matthew 5, that I would pray for them to bless them, that I want good things to happen to them.
[time=2732] Paul said that as well.
[time=2736] This is how Jesus said it.
[time=2737] Turned to Sermon on the Mount again, Matthew 5, verses 43 through 48.
[time=2742] You've heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy, but I tell you, that's that first verse is the rabbinical tradition of the day.
[time=2749] It's a twisted one.
[time=2750] Hate your enemy.
[time=2751] But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
[time=2755] Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your father
[time=2761] in heaven, that you may be like him, have his heart.
[time=2763] He calls his his son to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[time=2767] Those were good things in an agricultural economy.
[time=2770] If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?
[time=2773] Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
[time=2775] And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others?
[time=2778] Do not even pagans do that.
[time=2780] Be perfect or complete.
[time=2782] Therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect or complete, completely love, forgive, let
[time=2790] go in every circumstance, the way God let go of the big debt that you and I had incurred
[time=2799] with him, with our sin, not wishing one well for God, resisting blessing.
[time=2807] I was memorizing this verse many, many years ago when I was into God was just transforming
[time=2814] and changing my life and he was doing it in the business environment, that which I had held back from God.
[time=2823] And I had a competitor.
[time=2824] I was memorizing this verse and a competitor came to my mind, a competitor who I thought lied, mishandled the truth, he had an auction about the same time I had won in a particular
[time=2836] city and it just made it really, really hard to honor God and compete with him.
[time=2843] And so my prayer went like this, God, I don't get it.
[time=2849] I'm doing the God, it was my business saying, he's not, why don't you just destroy him and the story would go so much better if you would just let me reign.
[time=2861] And I'm memorizing this verse, and I'm recycling this verse for myself, this passage of verses and I said, all right, pray for those who love this guy, I love my enemy, I go, okay, God,
[time=2874] I hope he comes and know you, there we go.
[time=2877] And this dawned on me, and you might want to write this down, this is big, this is significant.
[time=2882] It dawned on me that I'm not really letting go of resisting blessing until I'll pray for him to be blessed in the exact same way I'm asking God to bless me.
[time=2892] I had just in my prayer gone through my, in my mind, all my people, all my staff, all the stuff about financial blessings that I needed in order to survive because of the position I was in at that time, and I couldn't hardly get the prayer out, about a week later, but
[time=2910] I could get it out when I finally would say I wanted him to be blessed in the same way I wanted to be blessed.
[time=2914] About a week later, I'm in Monterey, California, the auction was at night, so I worked out in the morning, got my fresh squeezed orange juice in my bagel, and I'm headed back to the room and there he is, the competitor that I'm struggling with sitting on a bench.
[time=2926] I just kind of wanted to walk by him, so got my, you know, my fresh squeezed orange juice trying to hide my bald head, that didn't work, and so I sat down beside him and I'll never forget what happened next.
[time=2939] He puts his hand on his face and he runs it through his hair and he goes, "God is with me again today."
[time=2949] And I said the most spiritual thing I could come up with, "No way, what are you saying?"
[time=2958] He went on to tell me, he had been alcoholic, I knew that, and he went to an AA meeting and he found out that the biggest debt ever incurred by anybody had been let go in Christ and
[time=2971] he surrendered his life and he was experiencing God's work in his life at that time, and about
[time=2977] a year later he died, he was a young man of a very unique disease, and I knew that he died in Christ.
[time=2986] I made up my mind that morning, I will never resist blessing again.
[time=2993] God has enough resources to go around and God's kingdom might be at work and in that person I'm withholding forgiveness from and withholding, resisting, holding on to resisting blessing and not letting go, and maybe that's the case for you today, maybe, just maybe,
[time=3009] the kingdom of God is at work in the life of the person that you're holding on to this resisting blessing.
[time=3015] Maybe you're holding on to the revenge, resentment, regret or resisting blessing, but maybe, just maybe, and I think it's probably true, the kingdom of God, God is active in that person's life, he's either drawing him to himself or he's sanctifying them, whatever he's doing,
[time=3030] because the biggest debt ever incurred has been let go.
[time=3035] I have been set free from that.
[time=3037] I can forgive these little bitty, horizontal debts.
[time=3041] Well, I've asked the team to come up and I want to give you an opportunity to let go.
[time=3051] For two weeks I did an experiment several years ago and I thought for the next two weeks I'm
[time=3057] not going to hold on, I'm going to let go, because I realize how often when I let go, I hold on for a length of time and then I let go.
[time=3064] So I thought I'm just going to do it this way.
[time=3066] I will let go immediately whenever anybody does anything wrong to me, okay, I'm just going to let go.
[time=3074] So first two days it was really, really hard, some sensitive.
[time=3078] By day three it got kind of funny and I thought to myself, "Is that all you got?
[time=3083] I'm Captain Forgiveness Man, bring it on." And I just kept letting go, letting go, letting go.
[time=3090] But you know what I realize in that two weeks, man, I can't forgive.
[time=3096] You can't forgive.
[time=3099] Only Christ in me can let go.
[time=3102] That's why people who are in Christ, who have received the payment of that debt vertically,
[time=3109] the biggest one, the biggest debt there could exist.
[time=3112] They are characterized and known by forgiving horizontally, letting go horizontally, these little bitty relational debts.
[time=3121] And it's not me doing it.
[time=3122] It's Christ in me.
[time=3123] And in order for that to happen and in order for that to occur in my heart, I have to surrender.
[time=3130] I have to let go.
[time=3131] I define surrender as just a simple two sentences really, you can't say it as one sentence, "I can't, you can." You say to Christ, "I can't, you can." I can't let go of revenge.
[time=3149] I can't let go of the prison wall of resentment.
[time=3157] I can't let go of resisting blessing my friend Christ, you can.
[time=3167] And I'm free.
[time=3169] When I allow him to let go, relationally is a little bitty debts.
[time=3173] I'm free.
[time=3174] It's a whole point of all this.
[time=3176] You read through the Bible, through this year, you probably got the Galatians 5.
[time=3180] Galatians 5.1 said, "It's for freedom that Christ has set you free.
[time=3184] Come out of the prison of unforgiveness and withholding that bondage, that death sentence.
[time=3191] You're dying inside in your soul.
[time=3193] Every time, you and I, every time we hold on to any combination of these four prison walls.
[time=3200] But if we don't let go of all four, we will not experience the freedom in Christ.
[time=3207] Forgiveness frees us for reconciliation.
[time=3211] Forgiveness always precedes reconciliation, but reconciliation might not always be forgiveness because, follow forgiveness because reconciliation takes too.
[time=3218] You know, I got to thinking, "What's the shape?
[time=3221] What's the shape of this master key to unlock the prison cell?" I came to the conclusion that it's a cross-shaped.
[time=3233] It's a picture of where the vertical intersects with the horizontal.
[time=3237] It's a picture of where I realized that the biggest debt ever incurred was let go from me.
[time=3243] And so I'm going to let go of all the horizontal little bitty debts.
[time=3249] And I'm going to be set free because forgiveness wells together two ideas, justice and mercy.
[time=3255] Justice without mercy is condemnation, mercy without justice is license, but forgiveness brings the two together and they're found in Jesus Christ.
[time=3263] And the picture of the cross is the picture of the key that unlocks the cell.
[time=3268] So here's what I'm going to ask you to do.
[time=3271] I'm going to ask you to come up and grab a rock here.
[time=3276] I want you to come up from each side of the stage and exit in the middle.
[time=3280] But we have an altar.
[time=3282] We have a community altar up here.
[time=3283] They were for communities.
[time=3286] And I want you to take that rock as a symbol of what you're holding on to, what part of the prison wall you might be holding on to because of the wrong that's committed against you.
[time=3296] It might be revenge, might be resentment, might be regret.
[time=3298] It might be resisting blessing, but I want this to be a symbol of letting go so you can
[time=3304] be free.
[time=3306] The team is going to say I surrender all and as they sing, if you've identified the day of the spirit of God has identified the day and you and it's probably every single one of us.
[time=3314] In fact, I'm going to go first, something that you're holding on to.
[time=3322] All I need to do is engage with other people and I'll experience one of these four prison
[time=3328] walls.
[time=3331] I want it to be a symbol right now, laying it at the altar and letting go and letting
[time=3337] God set me free.
[time=3340] So as they sing come, come in the size X of the middle, just grab a stone, you can come three, four wide each way and just let it be a symbol right now of letting go of the four
[time=3351] prison walls of withholding forgiveness.
[time=3363] Oh, to Jesus, I surrender all to Him I'm free again.
[time=3372] I will ever love and trust Him in His presence, daily, then I surrender all.
[time=3394] I surrender all to Him I'm free again.
[time=3412] Oh, to Jesus, I surrender all to Him, oh, to Jesus, oh, to Jesus, oh, to Jesus, I surrender
[time=3435] all to Him, oh, to Jesus, oh, to Jesus, oh, to Jesus, oh, to Jesus, oh, to Jesus,
[time=3454] oh, to Him I surrender all to Him I surrender all to Him, I surrender all to Him, I surrender all.
[time=3480] Anything to stop you, this is a symbol of the Spirit of Christ in you, setting you free.
[time=3493] And He's the one letting go of whatever prison wall it is, but don't miss this opportunity to come together because I got a feeling if you don't do it here, you're not going to let it happen in your heart.
[time=3504] So come and surrender whatever wall you're holding on to, whatever, be one, two, three,
[time=3510] or four.
[time=3511] Come surrender all to Christ right now, let go, quit holding on.
[time=3516] You won't die forever, you won't die forever, and I may die forever for you, you won't
[time=3592] you won't die forever, you won't die forever, you won't die forever, you won't die forever
[time=3613] forever.
[time=3643] So come and surrender, you won't die forever, you won't die forever, you won't die forever
[time=3667] forever, you won't die forever, you won't die forever, you won't die forever, you won't
[time=3719] forever, you won't die forever forever, you won't die forever forever, you won't die forever
[time=3744] forever, you won't die forever, you won't die forever, you won't die forever, you won't
