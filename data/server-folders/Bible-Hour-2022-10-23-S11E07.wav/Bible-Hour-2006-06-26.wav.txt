[time=280] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I am so grateful that you've tuned in and we are so thankful for what you're going to be able to experience today as you watch the broadcast.
[time=293] As most of you know, what you see on the broadcast is what took place the previous Sunday as the family gathered at Black Hawk.
[time=300] And this last week was just, it was an exceptional day.
[time=304] We are so thankful for what God did as Steve and Mitch and I tackled the subject of the sins of summer.
[time=312] And I won't say too much more about it.
[time=315] There are just some things that we felt like are unique to summer, to vacation, to June, July and August.
[time=323] And we want you, and I know we want it for ourselves and our family here at Black Hawk to be sensitive and aware of where the enemy sometimes goes in his temptation, in his invitation to you and to me to move outside of God's design for our lives.
[time=340] And so watch and listen, I think some of the things that Steve and Mitch share especially.
[time=345] It's some of the most insightful stuff I've ever heard on these topics, and I really think you're going to be encouraged.
[time=351] I also want to say this to you.
[time=353] You've heard me talk about it a few times.
[time=355] I got to say it to you again, August 10 through 12, we are so privileged and so excited here at Black Hawk to be hosting for the third year.
[time=364] We are a satellite site, a live satellite site for Willow Creek's 2006 Leadership Summit.
[time=371] And I'm going to have you watch a video here.
[time=373] I want you to watch some footage, especially as it relates to those who are going to be speakers at this year's summit.
[time=380] The Leadership Summit is for everybody.
[time=382] It's for those of you in the Fort Wayne community who are involved in the business world.
[time=387] Anybody, men, women in the marketplace setting, you may be coaching a team, you may be leading at home.
[time=394] I mean, in any situation where you have the chance to influence and lead, our hope is that you would want to have God honoring principles of leadership at work.
[time=405] And the summit gives you a chance to learn and understand more and more of those principles.
[time=411] Please come and join us August 10 through 12.
[time=414] For the summit, we'd love to have you with us.
[time=416] It's going to be a great couple days.
[time=418] And watch the video, watch what's coming.
[time=421] And watch what is going to be entailed in this conference.
[time=425] I think as you watch, you're really, really going to be encouraged.
[time=430] Where others see a brick wall, a leader sees the potential for so much more.
[time=438] One annual event can inspire you to turn vision into reality,
[time=447] encouraging innovation.
[time=449] Take risks that you normally wouldn't take because you have to.
[time=453] The skits, the music, the bratio, the speakers, there was always something to learn from.
[time=459] If you want to be empowered, this is the place to start.
[time=464] You're going to have a phenomenal experience and you're going to take something out of it.
[time=467] This is a great opportunity for us to come together and talk about the issue at the same time.
[time=471] It was new material crafted in a new and different way.
[time=474] They know leadership, they know church.
[time=477] [MUSIC]
[time=479] Cast in vision.
[time=480] When a vision lands in the hearts of people in a church, people start to soar.
[time=486] See yourself where you're on your way, too.
[time=488] Even when you're over here, you better learn how to see yourself over there.
[time=492] You'll never be content as a church leader until you have honed and defined your mission and a strategy statement.
[time=499] Human beings do not have an innate need to have their way.
[time=503] They have an innate need to have their way considered.
[time=506] It's factored in your decision.
[time=507] It starts with one person, one action, and it starts growing, building momentum.
[time=514] It's an amazing thing when God's done through the people at the summit.
[time=518] One experiences the possibilities.
[time=521] It opens up whole new horizons.
[time=523] Passion is genuine, it's from the heart.
[time=525] It's really inspiring and encouraging.
[time=527] It's just a blessing.
[time=528] I'm filled with tears right now to know that even though there is a gloomy side to ministry, there is also the glory side.
[time=536] Motivating change.
[time=538] They speak to me the way Jesus would speak to me.
[time=540] God is calling us to go beyond.
[time=543] This is what it's all about.
[time=545] I can't make it different.
[time=547] A chance to rest my life.
[time=550] It is not about individual churches, but it's about kingdom building.
[time=554] Guys like me survive on the encouragement of people and pastors and visions like Bill of Greek has.
[time=562] A leader must be able to see something before it exists.
[time=566] He's transforming the church in the UK.
[time=573] This global summit, it's going to change churches all over the world.
[time=580] I love thy church, O Lord.
[time=583] For her, my tears shall fall.
[time=586] For her, my prayers ascend.
[time=588] To her, my cares and toils be given till toils and cares shall end.
[time=596] [MUSIC]
[time=598] People's lives are changed forever.
[time=604] This summer, seeing reality not as it is, but how it might be.
[time=610] So there you have it.
[time=619] If that's something that you'd like to be a part of, and I really hope that you do, we'd love you to do this.
[time=625] Register for the event.
[time=627] Come and be with us.
[time=628] Just go to our website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=632] And over on the left-hand side, you'll find a leadership summit icon.

[time=948] breath that I take, every moment I'm aware, but have all that I give to you.
[time=963] Hey this morning, we want to do our very best, the three of us here.
[time=968] We want to just try our best to hopefully connect with you and connect with the Scriptures on
[time=976] a topic or in an arena that I think most of us, we believe most of us in the room can identify with.
[time=983] Steve and Mitch and I are very aware of the fact that all of us in this room, Romans,
[time=989] Romans 3, 23, all have what?
[time=993] All have sinned and fallen, what, short of the glory of God.
[time=997] Every one of us in this room is in the sin battle every day.
[time=1004] And while you see a slide there that talks about the sins of summer, please realize that
[time=1011] we're very aware of the fact that we could come back and give you this message in September and talk about the sins of the fall and we could come back in January and talk about the sins of winter.
[time=1022] We're not in any way indicating that summers, like the only time you and I are going to struggle with sin.
[time=1027] What we're saying to you though, this morning, and maybe we will come back in the fall and the winter and the spring, I don't know.
[time=1033] What we're saying to you this morning is this.
[time=1036] There seems to be a uniqueness to June, July, and August.
[time=1042] There seems to be something that kind of takes place and I realize for different ones of us in the room, this will probably impact us at different levels and in different ways.
[time=1050] But the fact of the matter is whether you're a student on summer break, whether you're
[time=1056] a parent of a student who's on summer break, whether you're a businessman, a businesswoman, a mom or dad, whether you're a grandmother or grandfather, no matter who you are, as we think about it, there's often times with June, July, and August, kind of a switch.
[time=1071] It's kind of a change.
[time=1072] The schedules get altered.
[time=1074] There's some different time frames.
[time=1076] There's some different scheduling stuff.
[time=1078] I mean, it's just kind of a unique period of time.
[time=1082] And often times, in those unique periods of time, often times when schedules have been
[time=1089] adjusted, oftentimes when there's kind of a newness, while there's things to enjoy there, oftentimes the enemy, oftentimes the enemy comes with that newness and tries to move
[time=1102] you and I down different roads and take you and I down different trails.
[time=1107] And so with the summer, there comes some unique challenges.
[time=1111] And we want to just address some of those, not all of them, just a few of them this morning.
[time=1116] And as we address them, our hope is that you will join us in our look to the Scriptures as to how we could sustain those temptations, how we could walk through those situations
[time=1127] in a way that would bring great glory and great honor to God.
[time=1131] So the sins of summer, can we afford a vacation?
[time=1135] Steve's going to start us off here.
[time=1137] We're going to look initially at three things, the opportunity that you and I have during the summer months to sometimes spend too much time chilling, too much time looking and
[time=1148] too much time talking.
[time=1150] And Steve came up with that outline, by the way, Steve's going to start us off with this
[time=1157] idea of how we spend our time.
[time=1159] Too much chilling.
[time=1162] You know, I would have said something like I'm lazy, my titles are really boring.
[time=1169] So one of the things I really love about being with these guys is that I come up with things through them that work, like too much chilling.
[time=1175] But I know what that means.
[time=1178] I've been doing it for 55 years.
[time=1182] And by the way, for those of you over 50, that, when it said B-O-N-O, that's not sunny bono.
[time=1188] Okay?
[time=1189] He didn't rise to the dead.
[time=1191] That is Bono.
[time=1192] He's a U2.
[time=1193] He's the leader.
[time=1194] He's the lead singer for U2.
[time=1197] And that's a very famous group that those of you that haven't heard of U2 as well.
[time=1202] So it'll be interesting to hear what he has to say about water in Africa and some other things.
[time=1206] It'll be good.
[time=1213] I not only am natural at chilling, at being lazy, I'm not only natural at it.
[time=1222] I valued it.
[time=1225] I can remember through high school and college the guys that were heroes to me were the laid
[time=1233] back ones.
[time=1234] It's natural for me.
[time=1235] So when people say you're laid back to me, I thought, but I thought I might as well take advantage of that.
[time=1240] So honestly, I worked at slowing my walk down.
[time=1247] And some of you may be connected with that.
[time=1251] And it wasn't hard for me to do that.
[time=1255] And I saw these guys that sat in the corner, smoking a cigarette, and the women in movies
[time=1262] came to them.
[time=1264] I thought that would happen to me.
[time=1265] It didn't happen, by the way.
[time=1266] What you do is you sit in the corner alone a lot.
[time=1271] But that's a natural for me.
[time=1273] Well, you're really losing it on this, aren't you?
[time=1278] I bet you need to chill.
[time=1284] Listen to the definition for slothfulness or laziness.
[time=1289] You can mask it lots of ways.
[time=1293] It's doing the opposite of doing what needs to be done when it needs to be done.
[time=1300] So it's not doing what needs to be done when it needs to be done.
[time=1306] I was taught by my dad to do what needed to be done first before I did what I wanted to do.
[time=1312] He literally beat that into me.
[time=1316] And I've tried to teach our children to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done.
[time=1322] But you know what?
[time=1325] At my age, I still fight that today.
[time=1328] I procrastinate.
[time=1330] I do what needs to be done.
[time=1332] And I just don't do it as well as I would have if I'd done it when I should have done it.
[time=1337] And that's true of me still to this day.
[time=1340] And telling you that helps me.
[time=1342] And God has protected me from it.
[time=1343] We'll look at that in a minute.
[time=1344] A sloth.
[time=1345] Listen to this.
[time=1347] This is some of you.
[time=1350] Sloth is a tropical mammal that lives much of its life hanging upside down and sleeping 15 to 22 hours a day.
[time=1360] I have some family members that could do that.
[time=1364] Not my immediate family.
[time=1366] But my sister.
[time=1367] Yeah.
[time=1368] Oh, yeah.
[time=1369] Easy.
[time=1370] Is that bad?
[time=1372] It's a filthy animal.
[time=1374] She's not like this.
[time=1375] It's a filthy animal.
[time=1376] You better get off the.
[time=1378] I know.
[time=1379] Get off the sister.
[time=1380] It's a filthy animal that builds no nest and seeks no shelter.
[time=1383] Not even for her young.
[time=1386] It's slow, very slow.
[time=1389] But a good day moving real well, it'll take 48 days to go, I think it said four miles.
[time=1396] Yeah, that's right.
[time=1399] That's when it's moving pretty well.
[time=1402] I have a natural tendency to be like that.
[time=1406] I'm not a person who wants to sleep all the time, but I want to play all the time.
[time=1411] And I love to vegetate and just allow my mind to be like if I get into a book that takes
[time=1417] me somewhere, I like that.
[time=1419] If I get into television, it'll take me somewhere else and I don't have to think.
[time=1422] I like that.
[time=1422] I love to watch movies.
[time=1424] I love to escape reality and I can spend all day doing it.
[time=1428] Now, some of you can't do that.
[time=1430] This is not your problem, but some of you in the room connect.
[time=1433] You know what I'm talking about.
[time=1436] Let's look at what Jesus had to say about it.
[time=1438] Matthew 25 verse 14, "For it is just like a man about to go on a journey who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them.
[time=1446] To one, he gave five talents to another two and to another one, each according to his own ability, and he went on his journey.
[time=1454] Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained five more talents.
[time=1460] In the same manner, the one who had received the two talents gained two more.
[time=1466] But he who received the one talent went away and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's
[time=1473] money.
[time=1474] Now, after a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
[time=1479] The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, "Master, you entrusted five talents to me.
[time=1486] See, I have gained five more talents." His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful slave.
[time=1493] You were faithful with a few things.
[time=1494] I will put you in charge of many things, enter into the joy of your master."
[time=1500] Also, the one who had received the two talents came up and said, "Master, you entrusted two talents to me.
[time=1507] See, I have gained two more talents." His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful slave.
[time=1512] You were faithful with a few things.
[time=1513] I will put you in charge of many things, enter into the joy of your master."
[time=1519] And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said, "Master, I knew you to be a hard man." Keeping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed.
[time=1533] And I was afraid and went away and hid your talent in the ground.
[time=1540] See, you have what is yours, you still have the talent.
[time=1545] But his master answered it and said to him, "You wicked, lazy, not fearful.
[time=1551] You wicked, lazy, not scared.
[time=1555] You wicked, lazy, slave.
[time=1558] You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed.
[time=1563] Then you ought to have put my money in the bank and on my arrival, he didn't even use the energy to put the money in the bank.
[time=1572] He said it was fear-driven.
[time=1574] He lied, maybe even to himself.
[time=1577] I know about that.
[time=1579] Maybe even to himself.
[time=1580] He lied.
[time=1581] And he said, "And on my arrival, I would have received my money back with interest." Now get this, "Therefore take away the talent, instead of enter into your master's joy.
[time=1590] Take away the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
[time=1594] For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance.
[time=1599] But from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.
[time=1604] Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness in that place.
[time=1609] There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[time=1612] For the sluggerd, the rewards are punishments."
[time=1618] Now get it.
[time=1622] The point of this parable, though it struck me so much, we went through this in our staff gathering one Wednesday back in the harvest room this year.
[time=1629] And when I saw that word, when it said that he was lazy, I thought no, he was afraid.
[time=1635] And I thought about how I am.
[time=1637] I justified my lazy behavior, sometimes with fear, sometimes with being tired, sometimes
[time=1644] with a need for rest, sometimes with a need for vegetating.
[time=1650] I can do it all kinds of ways, but I understand this.
[time=1654] My sin is my laziness.
[time=1656] I know that's true, and I need to confess that.
[time=1660] Jesus made it real clear, "I don't like what he said, it's really harsh, but I know what's true about me." Well, the opposite of laziness or slothfulness is not me becoming productive.
[time=1677] You might think it is.
[time=1678] It's not me putting a list together about how I'm never going to do that again, and I'm going to do this.
[time=1682] It's not about an alarm clock.
[time=1684] Now God, by his grace, what he did for me was snatch me out of any opportunity to be
[time=1691] like that and put me in schoolwork, the bell rings every 50 minutes.
[time=1698] There's a new thing that you do.
[time=1701] I get there at 7.30 in the morning, actually a little earlier, but we started devotions at 7.40 every day, I had to be there.
[time=1707] I had to be there.
[time=1709] I said in first service, a good thing, I wasn't an author.
[time=1712] I would have never gotten started and written any book, but I had to be there.
[time=1716] He did that for me.
[time=1717] And then when I was finished with my school life and he put me into race to win and working in some other, he gave me the opportunity to start at 6.30 every morning with Bible studies
[time=1727] that I lead.
[time=1728] I don't have a chance to be the sloth that I am.
[time=1733] So he's protected me from that.
[time=1734] And I'll say this, the opposite is not me putting a schedule together.
[time=1739] The opposite of my laziness is me being in relationship with him in a steadfast love.
[time=1745] What I said is the Hebrew word for that.
[time=1748] It's the opposite of laziness.
[time=1750] It's a steadfast love that comes from him, through me, to others, and back to him.
[time=1759] When I'm in steadfast loving relationship with a God who's in a steadfast loving relationship with me, I'm not lazy.
[time=1767] And he protects me from my own laziness when I get focused on him.
[time=1772] Romans 12.
[time=1773] We'll quit here.
[time=1774] Well, 9 through 13 says, "Let love be without hypocrisy." Love.
[time=1780] Look at it.
[time=1781] "Let love be without hypocrisy." That's the agape word there.
[time=1784] Abhore what is evil, cling to what is good.
[time=1788] Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.
[time=1790] Get this.
[time=1791] Give preference to one another in honor.
[time=1794] Not lagging behind in diligence.
[time=1798] The opposite of my lazy lagging behind in diligence is love.
[time=1803] Love.
[time=1804] He'll love me.
[time=1806] I'll love that way, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer, contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.
[time=1818] Love.
[time=1819] When I practice love, that steadfast love that comes from him, I'm not lazy anymore.
[time=1829] It was such an interesting insight that you told us this morning about in the parable of the guy, masking his laziness in fear.
[time=1841] And Proverbs 26, 13 says, "The sluggerd says, 'There's a lion in the road, a fierce lion
[time=1847] roaming the streets.'" And it's just an excuse to be lazy.
[time=1852] It's amazing how that transcends time.
[time=1856] So summer, June, July, August, again, just to stay with the theme here, there's a uniqueness
[time=1862] about it.
[time=1863] And you and I both know there are opportunities, no matter how old you are, there just seems to be in those summer months some extra opportunities to do what you're going to do with the time
[time=1875] that God's given you.
[time=1877] And I know Steve's hope and Mitch and I as well, our hope is that you'll give some thought to what you do with that time.
[time=1885] This idea of one who moves away from laziness toward diligence and fervency and spirit all
[time=1892] connected to a love relationship with God.
[time=1895] It's an amazing truth.
[time=1896] It's a great, great point.
[time=1899] Stay away from too much challenge.
[time=1901] Next.
[time=1902] Too much looking.
[time=1905] What's the focal point of your eyes?
[time=1912] This is amazing that this happened to me this morning.
[time=1914] I was coming up one of the doors here, one of the south doors and I opened it and the door handle came off in my hand, all right.
[time=1922] And Steve, you want to tell them why that happened?
[time=1924] Well, either it was designed without a seal or whoever installed it failed to seal it because
[time=1932] the water in both of these joints came through and rusted out the bolt or screw that attaches
[time=1938] that thing to the door.
[time=1939] Over the course of time because it wasn't sealed properly, it broke off.
[time=1944] I'm going to come back to that.
[time=1946] When it comes to looking, we have a 180 degree choice on what to do with our eyes.
[time=1954] And in summertime, you know, girls tend to wear less, guys tend to look more.
[time=1959] But it doesn't have to be such a sexual connotation.
[time=1962] In the summertime, we get thirstier.
[time=1965] You might drink more of fuzzy drinks with sweet names and you know, all that kind of thing.
[time=1971] So it can be anything that you're going to have be the focal point of your eyes.
[time=1977] And I want to start with desiring images apart from God first and I'm going to face this
[time=1985] way to kind of give you what that is.
[time=1989] First of all, let's look at 1 John 2 16.
[time=1991] 1 John 2 16 says everything in the world that's that which is opposed to God, cosmos, that's
[time=1997] which is opposed to God, everything in the world that's opposed to God, everything that is opposed to God, the cravings of simple man, the lust of his eyes, the boasting of what
[time=2007] he has and does comes not from the father, but from the world, that which is opposed
[time=2013] to God.
[time=2014] So I have this problem just focusing right now on the lust of the eyes, each one of us here has that issue.
[time=2020] And it's desiring life apart from God 180 degrees with images apart from him that I wasn't
[time=2028] designed to focus on.
[time=2031] Again, it could be for a guy, it could be a girl, it could be money, it could be some material possession.
[time=2038] And here's what happens is we do that.
[time=2042] Look at Proverbs 27 20, this is amazing.
[time=2045] Death and destruction are never satisfied and neither are the eyes of man.
[time=2051] So whatever I take in here, whatever image click on the internet, whatever magazine picture,
[time=2060] whatever movie, whatever man's husband or daughter who walks by, whatever I take in here,
[time=2069] I think it'll satisfy me, but it doesn't because it leaves me wanting more.
[time=2078] Now women, you're not off the hook because you have the other side of this equation.
[time=2086] And look at 3000 years ago, what Proverbs said about this, it's Proverbs 625, it's talking
[time=2094] about a woman who's desiring over here apart from God.
[time=2098] Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.
[time=2105] So women, it might just not be how you dress or junior high girl, I mean whatever, it might not be just how you dress, but it's what you're doing with your eyes.
[time=2114] You know how you do that, you kind of, oh, let me do it again, here we go.
[time=2123] Let's see, you know, only the women are laughing, see they know, Steve, what do you think?
[time=2129] Scary.
[time=2130] Okay.
[time=2131] All right, inside you is a desire to be pursued, a desire to be pursued and it's strong, right?
[time=2142] Kelly asked me, first I already said, you know, is that wrong?
[time=2145] I said, well, Megan and I, I'm going to share a private conversation, Megan and I, my 16-year-old
[time=2151] have this conversation before and I said, you know, before there's an emotional connection, that desire in you to be pursued is so strong, I'd really like you to decide in advance by whom you want to be pursued, how you want to be pursued, when in your life you want to
[time=2167] be pursued, where you want to be pursued, why you want to be pursued, before there's ever an emotional connection, because when that emotional connection starts, that pursuit thing kicks in, that desire for pursuit and you start captivating with your eyes and you know, and pretty soon you're farther long than you ever wanted to be and you were someone you probably weren't designed to be with, does that make sense?
[time=2188] You with me?
[time=2190] And so we want to determine that before we have an emotional connection.
[time=2194] Well, it doesn't satisfy to pursue images to fill my eyes apart from God doesn't satisfy
[time=2200] and Jesus said that the eyes are linked to the human heart, the eyes are linked to the
[time=2206] human heart, that what I take in through my eyes affects my heart, he called it the lamp of the body, and it actually then affects my body.
[time=2212] I first see it with my eyes, the desire to my heart, and then I act with my body, right?
[time=2216] Well, here's where this door handle comes in.
[time=2219] Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 10, 13 that each one of us will be tempted, temptation is common
[time=2225] to man, but he says, "When we're tempted, God always provides a doorway out."
[time=2232] Now if I've been sealed with the Holy Spirit from fully strung in my life to Christ, I'm
[time=2239] going to have that doorway out.
[time=2242] But if I haven't been, that handle is going to fall off in my hand and I'm going to live
[time=2248] in that direction.
[time=2252] Here is what God designed us for, I'm going to face this way, a 180 degree turn, a shift
[time=2259] of my eyes.
[time=2262] Verse 12, 2 says, "Fix your eyes on Jesus."
[time=2268] Fix means focus, it's this intent gaze, it's the focal point of not only my eyes, but the
[time=2275] eyes of my heart that I'm going to look at him and he's going to be the focal point of
[time=2282] my life.
[time=2283] And then everything else seems to fall together, it's amazing because that's what I was designed to do.
[time=2289] Look what 1 John 2, 17, where we started, the next verse, look what it says.
[time=2295] The world over here and its desires pass away, they don't satisfy and they pass away, they
[time=2302] don't last.
[time=2304] But the man who does the will of God, who desires God, who fixes his eyes on Christ,
[time=2311] he lives forever, eternal, abundant, zoey spiritual life.
[time=2319] So I kept trying to come up with this acronym and I think God gave it to me this morning on what to do.
[time=2325] Because what you do with your eyes, the bottom line is your focus.
[time=2328] One image, I'll go with the door handle so you won't, you can switch images here, is a magnifying glass.
[time=2334] A magnifying glass focuses on the image that's being magnified and everything else around
[time=2341] it becomes fuzzy.
[time=2343] So I'm either going to magnify Christ and other things can be fuzzy, or I'm going to
[time=2350] go 180 degrees this way and magnify images that I wasn't designed to magnify and then Christ becomes fuzzy in my life, does that make sense, you with me?
[time=2360] So here's the acronym, I want you to write it down.
[time=2363] As a believer, we start here facing this direction, fix F is fix your eyes on Christ,
[time=2371] it's going to come on the screen, fix your eyes on Christ.
[time=2376] My focal point of my heart and my life needs to be on Christ.
[time=2381] Oh, ask him to open the eyes of my heart, this is Ephesians 1, and it goes on to say
[time=2389] that when that happens, I receive hope, I receive his riches, I receive this incomparable
[time=2397] power that we're talking about to not go there.
[time=2403] And then see, it's Job 31.1, Job said, "I made a covenant with my eyes, see is covenant.
[time=2409] Covenant with God, covenant with your eyes, that I'm not even going to go and lust after another woman," he said, "I'm not going to go 180 degrees that way." So often guys, we just say, "Oh, you know, I'm a man, you know, and that's just what guys do, or girls, you know, I'm just a girl, and I just want to be attractive.
[time=2425] That's all, I just want to be attractive." And we go this way, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[time=2429] We make a covenant with God and with our eyes that this is what we're about, this direction.
[time=2437] And then here's the you.
[time=2438] This is the pivot point of it all, 180 degrees, you know, I'm going to go here, here, not which way am I going to go?
[time=2443] Am I going to go this way, or am I going to go this way?
[time=2445] Kind of like a basketball game.
[time=2446] So you understand that I am going to be tempted, 1 Corinthians 10, 13, it's common, I'm going
[time=2453] to be tempted.
[time=2454] But also understand that God will provide a doorway out.
[time=2461] And one way to apply that doorway to my life is the s, and that's shift my eyes.
[time=2469] Shift my eyes, that's the s, shift my eyes back to Christ.
[time=2473] Because see, the temptation is going to come to me, and I'm going to see it.
[time=2478] We can order our world to see it less, but it's going to come, and I have a choice.
[time=2482] Or this way, where it doesn't satisfy, the images don't satisfy, and I'm left wanting
[time=2488] more or go this way where I'm satisfied and fulfilled in Christ.
[time=2492] You might say, well, how do I do that?
[time=2494] How do I shift my eyes back to Christ?
[time=2496] I'm going to give you a few practical tools, and now I'm going to talk to guys especially.
[time=2501] First one is, I really think it would help if you had some scripture memorized.
[time=2506] Jesus fought temptation by quoting scripture.
[time=2510] And if some of that scripture's in here, it's easier to recall it when I need it, okay?
[time=2516] Second one is, I think every guy needs another guy to share his temptations with.
[time=2520] I have one of those.
[time=2521] It's the difference in not sinning.
[time=2524] You confess, and I'm tempted, and you get that doorway out.
[time=2527] It's amazing how that works.
[time=2530] Third.
[time=2531] Can I just interrupt you real quick?
[time=2533] What he just said, there's really, really important guys, and I wouldn't exclude women at all.
[time=2538] But I would just say this to you, so many times, you and I have heard over the year, have a guy you can share your failures with, and I understand there's great benefit in that,
[time=2549] but I want you to hear what he just said.
[time=2551] He has a guy that he shares his temptations with, and I know, I mean, if you're alive
[time=2559] here today, breathing, and I know that makes sense, and there's just, I didn't want to
[time=2566] let that go by, that's just a powerful concept that may not be new to you, it may be, but
[time=2572] while it's good to have someone you can share your failures with, why not have someone you can share the temptations with before you ever get to the failure, and pray with you who can talk to you?
[time=2584] That's just a great point, that's good.
[time=2589] So we have that person in your life, the third thing is pictures, photographs.
[time=2594] I think it's good to have pictures of your wife, of your kids, that you can physically shift your eyes back toward, but I'm going to give you kind of a unique take on it that
[time=2605] was in a book written several years ago, and the guy said, "Have a picture of your wife
[time=2612] when she was a little girl, so that you can see her and be reminded on seeing her with
[time=2618] your eyes the way her father saw her." Now we're seeing her at the soul, at the heart level, at a vulnerable level, and I think
[time=2629] it also helps to see all women that way.
[time=2631] I've just tried to look women in the eyes, you know what I mean, just see them at the
[time=2637] soul level, this has been something that I've tried to apply in my life, to see females at the soul level, and girls, you know, kind of the application here for you would be think
[time=2647] about how you're captivating a guy with your eyes, and I want to go back to the focus for you.
[time=2652] You know, fix your eyes on Christ, open eyes of your heart, you want intimacy anyway, that's where you're going to find the intimacy that satisfies.
[time=2658] He has a design for that, and it's interesting, you're covenant with your eyes, he will give you a covenant relationship, a marriage, and you understand that you're going to be tempted and you're standing, he gives you a doorway out, and you can shift your eyes back to him by the power of his spirit in you.
[time=2671] One application for you would be just ask yourself, is it too tight, too short, too revealing?
[time=2676] And am I trying to attract guys, you know, for the wrong reason, it's going to be short-term?
[time=2683] We were lifting weights with Megan's basketball team a couple years ago, and very innocently they were having a conversation that came up, somebody said, "Ask Coach, she came up to me and want to know why there was a problem with what she had worn that day," which she did not have on at that moment, "why it would have been a problem with the teacher that day." And I talked to her a little bit, she wanted to know what goes on in a guy's mind, a very general, clear, gentle and wise way, I described what a guy does with his eyes.
[time=2709] And light ball went off, "oh, what should I do?" I said, "well every morning I think you ought to come down and how you're dressed, as your dad there?" She said, "yeah," I said, "ask your dad, ask your dad, is this okay with what I have on?" And dad, this is where you need to come in and be active in that role.
[time=2728] And is it too tight, too short, too revealing?
[time=2731] And even if she's going to be some tears shed, you've got to protect your daughter.
[time=2735] I've been begging dads for years to get in the game of how their daughters dress.
[time=2743] They don't want to because when they do, their wives and daughters aren't happy.
[time=2750] And then they have to bear up under that.
[time=2754] But dads hear this and wives, you need to hear this.
[time=2758] What women think is cute and innocent, men know sometimes, is really sexy.
[time=2767] And so dads need to get in that game and be willing to suffer the consequence that they're not going to like you, but tell them the truth about how your daughter and your wife looks
[time=2779] to other men and don't let that happen.
[time=2782] Men, every man's battle told us to bounce our eyes away from whatever it is that we have a tendency to want to stick on, bounce away from that to something good, but bounce to the Word of God and fix your eyes on the author and perfecter of your faith, what he said on Focus.
[time=2797] Make sure that you do that and then be willing to take the action to help your wives.
[time=2802] But wives, you need to yield to that, too, because you think it's cute, but it's not.
[time=2808] I'll just say this to you and we'll move on.
[time=2814] There are times that we kind of make light, ladies, about how we as men maybe don't understand
[time=2824] all that goes on inside your minds, and it's true we don't.
[time=2834] So we'll keep working at that.
[time=2836] You keep helping us.
[time=2837] Let me just say this to you.
[time=2838] I think most of you ladies don't have any idea, and I appreciate it when I see you working at it, but I don't think you have any idea what goes on inside the mind of a young man
[time=2852] or even an older man.
[time=2855] And I know that that's something that younger men and older men have to wrestle with and continue to move through, but I think this morning I just want to remind you that you can help.
[time=2864] You know, I think the three of us would stand here together and say we would much rather just see your eyes.
[time=2872] So don't dress in a way that would innocently or even purposely attempt to move those eyes
[time=2884] elsewhere.
[time=2887] And with your daughters, whether it's you as a woman with, you know, older men, whether it's your daughter and the world that she lives in with younger men, you I know along
[time=2897] with us want to do everything, you know, that we can to help move young men in a healthy direction so they can be good husbands to your daughters, not 25 year olds, so unbelievably
[time=2911] wracked with guilt and pain and crud in their heads.
[time=2916] And I'm not laying that all at your feet.
[time=2918] I'm not.
[time=2919] I'm just saying you can help ladies, young women, you can help by being so very, very
[time=2925] careful and wise with how you present yourself and the way you dress.
[time=2930] Hey, men, older men, younger men, I'll say I will add absolutely nothing to what Mitchell
[time=2936] just talked you through.
[time=2939] I would say to you get the CD.
[time=2944] I will what he just taught you through there that I couldn't say it any better.
[time=2950] That was good teaching and those are good principles and I would encourage every man in this room like to get that CD and to give some thought to how he just took us through
[time=2960] that.
[time=2961] It was excellent.
[time=2962] Lastly, sometimes in the summer with the extra time we we eat too much.
[time=2969] Sometimes we play too much.
[time=2971] You know what?
[time=2972] Bottom line is sometimes you talk too much or whatever reason there's that little extra bit of time and maybe it's at the pool, maybe it's at the lake, maybe it's in the washroom on the phone, maybe it's, well, we could be in a number of different places but sometimes there's just a freedom that comes and a schedule that's different and we just, we start talking and oftentimes those discussions you know and I know go in directions, they shouldn't go.
[time=2997] They begin to include things, they shouldn't include.
[time=2999] People begin to get talked about situations and circumstances.
[time=3003] Like I start to get re-told, it's called gossip, sometimes there's just too much talking and
[time=3012] I want to remind you about this.
[time=3013] I don't want to talk to you this morning about your mouth, I want to remind you what scripture says about your heart because my friends, your words reveal your character.
[time=3024] Our words reveal the realities of our hearts.
[time=3028] Just go real quick, would you go to Matthew?
[time=3032] Go to Matthew 12, it says in Matthew 12, 34, it says you brood of vipers, how can you being
[time=3044] evil speak what is good, for the mouth speaks out of that which fills the what?
[time=3050] The heart, so the good man brings out of his good treasure what is good and the evil brings out of his evil treasure and his evil heart, what is evil?
[time=3058] I tell you that every careless word and the summer is filled with careless opportunities.
[time=3067] Every careless word that people speak they will give an accounting for in the day of judgment
[time=3074] or by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned.
[time=3080] My friends, our speech and our talk and the places we go with it, it reveals a heart condition.
[time=3087] So here's my point, my point is this, just like with Steve who earlier said the answer to slothfulness or laziness wasn't hyperactivity on the due different front.
[time=3099] With slothfulness the answer was to grow in one's relationship with who?
[time=3105] With God so that his steadfast love could move through you and move you toward activity, truly honoring and glorifying to him, hey with the mouth, listen, I just want to make
[time=3116] sure that you hear this.
[time=3117] I would ask for you today not to make a list of things you're not going to say.
[time=3122] I would want you to give time and attention to the condition of your heart because when
[time=3128] your heart is right, when you're feasting on this, when you're memorizing this, when you're surrounded by this, when you're giving yourself to this and to others and to him,
[time=3140] when you're serving faithfully, when you're giving graciously, when you're taking in these words of life, hiding God's truth in your heart so you will not sin against him.
[time=3151] When you're nurturing your heart, the words that come out will be words that nurture.
[time=3156] They will be words consistent with what you see in Ephesians 4.
[time=3160] Turn there.
[time=3161] Ephesians 4.29.
[time=3162] Here you go.
[time=3163] With a heart that's being nurtured, you get this right here.
[time=3166] Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for
[time=3172] edification.
[time=3174] Big word, edification.
[time=3176] It's a medical word in the Greek that had to do with setting and propping up and compressing
[time=3183] and helping a broken bone.
[time=3186] These are words that heal, not tear down.
[time=3190] These are words that help, not diminish.
[time=3193] These are words that soothe, not saddened, and you and I are to be given to no unwholesome
[time=3201] words, but instead words that build up, words that heal, go back to Ephesians 4 there.
[time=3206] You can see it good for edification, according to the need of the moment, so that it will
[time=3212] give grace, not information, not current data, so that it will give grace to those who hear.
[time=3221] Then skip down to Ephesians 4.31.
[time=3224] Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor, you know what clamor is, clamor is clamor
[time=3230] is all the stuff that's going on, all the stuff that people are talking about, all the things that are happening, it's the buzz, it's the clamor.
[time=3240] He says and let all anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, discarded, along with
[time=3247] all malice. Verse 32 says, "Be kind," in the words that you speak, the context here being
[time=3254] our speech, be kind to one another, tenderhearted, whether they're there or not.
[time=3262] Have your talk about them, be kind and tenderhearted and forgiving just as God in Christ
[time=3268] also has forgiven you, so be careful.
[time=3273] My friends, be so very careful, and one last thing, and then we're going to go, in fact why don't you just stand quietly, would you do that?
[time=3285] Connected to all three of these, obviously, is kind of our last main point, and maybe it goes without saying, but let me just say it to you, too many times, June, July and August, and I'm going to use this room, listen, I'm going to use this room just as an example
[time=3301] because it's not all, you know me, you know us, your relationship with Christ and what
[time=3307] we experience in relationship with Him and each other, it is not just about this room,
[time=3313] you know that, but it does entail what takes place in this room, and why in June, July
[time=3322] and August are there fewer of us in this room, and you can start, you can start giving me
[time=3334] answers, and I'll just take those answers right here, and in, you know, all my years
[time=3341] I haven't heard many good ones, why does giving go down, why does attendance go down, why does
[time=3351] June, July and August somehow just mean that we take a break, we just kind of step back,
[time=3360] we do some other things, and hear me now, I'm talking about being together, and that
[time=3367] may be being together in a living room, in community, it may be here in the gathering,
[time=3373] it may be in a restaurant booth with some good friends, we need all of that, but we need all of that, and we need to be encouraged, stimulated to love and good deeds, Hebrews
[time=3384] 10, we need to not forsake this privilege that God has given us of being together, June,
[time=3391] July and August included, so our hope is that you'll give some thought to these things,
[time=3399] our hope is that along with the three of us who find ourselves right smack dab in the middle of this battle that we've articulated to you this morning, our hope is that you'll along with us do our very best to faithfully walk through these things with our eyes fixed
[time=3414] on the author and perfecter of our faith, pray with us, thank you, pray with us, Father
[time=3421] God we are so very, so very appreciative of this relationship God that you've given us
[time=3429] with you, and we're so very thankful for the opportunity to share in that with so many.
[time=3435] God we need each other, we need the encouragement, and we need the accountability, and we need the reminder, we need the strength and the support and the courage that comes when the body of Christ lives and shares life together, and so God as we move through the remaining
[time=3450] weeks of the summer, God I pray that you would give us great strength, I pray that these things that we've looked at this morning that you would help us to recall them, that I pray that we would be students, each of us in our own right, just giving ourselves to a clearer understanding of how we can walk these paths and move through these temptations, and God if there's anybody in the room that needs help, and I know there is, I know there are
[time=3478] people in this room this morning who desperately need help, they are losing the battle with
[time=3487] one or two or all three of these arenas that we've touched on this morning, oh God please
[time=3493] give them the courage of heart to just simply raise a hand, so to speak, with a friend, a
[time=3499] trusted friend who they know they could confide in, give them the courage to ask for the help
[time=3506] that they desperately need, God we look forward to the songs in the weeks to come, we pray
[time=3512] that you bring us back, all of us, bring us back next week with an anticipation in our
[time=3518] hearts and minds as to that which you're going to teach us and show us in those times together.
[time=3524] Thank you for the privilege of being together this morning, and we look forward to being together again soon, if that be your will, and all the people agreed and said amen, God
[time=3534] bless you.
