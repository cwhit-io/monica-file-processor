[time=0] (beeping)
[time=30] - Hi, my name's Sam Barfell, and I have the privilege of serving as the superintendent of Black Hawk Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=40] And Black Hawk Christian School has been in existence for just over 30 years, and I'd like to take this opportunity just to share some of the exciting things about what we get to do as a Christian school.
[time=50] First of all, we use a line around here that goes like this.
[time=54] We believe Black Hawk Christian School provides academic excellence on a biblical foundation, and there are two parts to that.
[time=59] The academic excellence is something that we pursue hard, and we have a rigorous curriculum that we challenge our students to give their very best and be the very best student that God's called them to be.
[time=70] But the other part of that is the biblical foundation.
[time=73] Everything that we teach comes from the truth of Scripture and the premise of everything we teach comes from that scriptural base, and that is what we call teaching truth.
[time=84] And then the other thing I'd like to tell you about is our faculty.
[time=86] We just have an incredible team of people who make up the teachers and the faculty of the staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=93] And these people have given their professional lives and their ministry lives to serving the students that God has by His sovereignty placed right here in our school, to provide that academic excellence on a biblical foundation.
[time=107] And it is my pleasure to work next and alongside those who are the faculty and staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=114] They are second to none, I'm convinced of that.
[time=116] And I would like to just encourage you and challenge you during these summer months as you're thinking about next fall, school starting up again, to think about and explore the possibility of your child, your students becoming part of the family here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=131] And I would challenge you to give us a call and let us give you what we call a tour and a talk.
[time=137] Walk through our facilities so you can catch kind of a heart glimpse of what we're about and what we're trying to accomplish and how we're trying to partner with parents who want their children to walk in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ and how that and education are just seamlessly welded together in such a powerful way.
[time=154] And so I invite you to give us a call, get on our website and contact us and let us give you some more information about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=165] Thanks so much, we look forward to hearing from you.

[time=848] And also I'd like to encourage you to hang in there with us right now and listen to Kelly as he shares what's on his heart from Psalm 23 this week.
[time=856] I'm sure by now that you would have reached out.
[time=877] And my dark tears away, stepped in and saved the day.
[time=885] But once again, I say amen, and it's still raining.
[time=895] But as the thunder rolls, they're here.
[time=900] You whisper through the rain.
[time=903] I'll refuse.
[time=907] And as your mercy falls, I'll raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away.
[time=920] I'll praise you in this storm, and I'll lift my hands for you are who you are.
[time=929] No matter where I am, and every tear I've cried, you hold in your hands.
[time=938] You never left my sight, and though my heart is too old, I will praise you in this storm.
[time=955] I remember when I stumbled in the wind.
[time=961] You heard my cry to you and raised me up again.
[time=967] But my strength was almost gone.
[time=970] How can I carry on?
[time=973] If I can't find you.
[time=977] But as the thunder rolls, they're here.
[time=982] You whisper through the rain.
[time=985] I'll refuse.
[time=989] And as your mercy falls, I'll raise my hands and praise the God who gives.
[time=996] And takes away.
[time=1001] And I'll praise you in this storm, and I'll lift my hands for you are who you are.
[time=1010] No matter where I am, and every tear I've cried, you hold in your hands.
[time=1019] You never left my sight, and though my heart is too old,
[time=1027] I will praise you in this storm.
[time=1035] I lift my eyes up to the hills.
[time=1038] Where does my help come from?
[time=1041] My help comes from the Lord, maker of heaven and earth.
[time=1046] I lift my eyes up to the hills.
[time=1049] Where does my help come from?
[time=1052] My help comes from the Lord, maker of heaven and earth.
[time=1066] Now I'll praise you in this storm,
[time=1073] and I will lift my hands for you are who you are.
[time=1079] No matter where I am, and every tear I've cried, you hold in your hands.
[time=1088] You never left my sight, and though my heart is too old, I will praise you in this storm,
[time=1103] and though my heart is too old, I will praise you in this storm.
[time=1133] [MUSIC]
[time=1147] Thank you, PT and Stephanie.
[time=1150] Thank you so very much.
[time=1154] What an amazing God, a God who allows us, a God who beckons us, a God who we long to worship in the midst of the storms of life.
[time=1165] We will study more, and we will look at this great God in just a few minutes as we jump into our summer series, a summer in the Psalms.
[time=1175] If you've got your Bibles, please open up to Psalm 23, a Psalm of David.
[time=1183] Psalm of David.
[time=1186] In what may be the most familiar, the most quoted passage in all of Scripture, David, who was, by the way, the most prolific of all the Psalm writers, David here in this Psalm, the 23rd Psalm, he describes his God.
[time=1205] He describes his God.
[time=1208] He paints a picture for you and I of our God in a very clear, and in a very powerful, and a very compelling way.
[time=1218] This Psalm, as is the case with all the Psalms, is a song.
[time=1221] They were literally songs written and meant to be sung as an offering of worship and praise to God.
[time=1228] This song, a six verse treatment of God's character, God's faithfulness, and God's unique commitment to his people.
[time=1238] What I love about Psalm 23 and what I love about, you know, most, if not all, of Scriptures, I just love how in so many situations that I find myself in, the great truth of Psalm 23 is so applicable in the everyday of life to so many.
[time=1255] I can be sitting in a restaurant booth.
[time=1257] I can be in my office.
[time=1259] I can be on an email back and forth with someone who doesn't know the Lord, who is at a place on their spiritual journey where they've yet to fully surrender their heart and life to him.
[time=1271] They're asking questions.
[time=1272] They're in the midst of the journey and they're trying to figure out what it means to be in a relationship with the living God.
[time=1279] And as I have those ongoing conversations, there are times when it is so appropriate and so exciting for me to point them toward a great truth like this, a great picture and a great description of this God that I long for him or I long for her, whoever the person might be, to know and to experience.
[time=1301] I can go to the other side of the coin, though, and I can think of times where I've said in restaurant booths or been in my office or been emailing back and forth with someone who knows the Lord, someone who's made a commitment to Christ.
[time=1315] They at some point have fully surrendered their heart and life to him, and yet today in that moment for whatever reason they're wandering, they've thrown it in reverse and they're taking steps backwards.
[time=1329] It's not going well.
[time=1332] And at times like that, as God gives me, and as I guess he gives you opportunities to come alongside and encourage and remind, there are times where it is so appropriate to point them toward the great truth of these six verses.
[time=1345] And this great picture that David paints as he describes his Lord.
[time=1354] It's a passage that makes much of him.
[time=1358] And in the process draws us ever closer to our Lord.
[time=1364] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1369] I shall not want.
[time=1373] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=1377] He leads me beside quiet waters.
[time=1382] He restores my soul.
[time=1386] He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[time=1392] And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil.
[time=1400] For you are with me, your rod, and your staff, they comfort me.
[time=1406] You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[time=1411] You have anointed my head with oil, my cup overflows, surely goodness, and loving kindness.
[time=1418] I almost sit mercy because I memorize this from the King James, and I was about six, I think.
[time=1424] Surely goodness and mercy, surely goodness and loving kindness will follow me all the days of my life.
[time=1432] Say this with me out loud, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[time=1439] Pray with me, would you?
[time=1442] Father, God, we humbly and expectantly.
[time=1447] And gratefully, God, we gather here today, and we come before you.
[time=1451] We enter into your presence.
[time=1453] With that unique mix, as PT described earlier, that unique mix of boldness and unworthiness, God, we are humbled.
[time=1463] That you allow us in, God, we are so grateful that you long to meet us in these places.
[time=1468] God, and teach us, and remind us, and convict us, and grow us, and set us on a new course.
[time=1474] God, we're so thankful that in the midst of all we've faced this week, God, in the midst of poor decisions, in the midst of trying times, in the midst of relational struggle, God, in the midst of heartache and difficulty, we're able to pause here this morning, come to the life-giving, life-changing scriptures, and be so very encouraged by what we see and read and study.
[time=1500] God, as we do that this morning, God, we pray that you would honor that effort, God, that as we do our best to explain it, and as we do our best to engage with it, God, that you would move us through the realities that you've allowed to surround us, God, meet each and every one of us in this room this morning, right where we are.
[time=1522] God, allow your truth, and allow the comfort and the direction that it brings, minister to each and every one of us in powerful ways.
[time=1531] Well, thank you for it.
[time=1532] Thank you, God, for the privilege of being together and studying your Word in your Son's name.
[time=1537] We pray.
[time=1538] [AMEN] Well, you know, as I look at this, and as I've looked at this for the last several weeks, in preparation for our first Sunday in this series, and as I read through Psalm 23, these six verses again and again and again, it became very clear to me that there was no other way to come at this, but to try to just phrase by phrase, literally word by word, just draw your attention to the great truth that God has brought to each of us, as we make our way through these six verses.
[time=1574] You know, there isn't a word in those six verses that you can really leave out.
[time=1578] And most of it will get to this morning, the rest of it's going to be available to you online this week.
[time=1585] Other parts of it you'll be able to follow up with in your study guide that I hope you'll pick up.
[time=1590] But let me just jump in here from the very get-go.
[time=1592] Let me just jump in with the first verse, the first phrase, get out your pen, take some notes, give some thought to this life-changing truth, this great description of our God.
[time=1603] You ready?
[time=1604] Here we go.
[time=1605] Verse 1, first phrase, you see it?
[time=1607] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1613] I not only want you to write that down, I want you to look at that screen, I want you to look at those words there in your text or up there behind me.
[time=1621] I want you just to consider that for a moment, my friends.
[time=1624] This is the truth.
[time=1625] The Lord, the Lord God is, David says, my shepherd.
[time=1632] And as I go through each phrase, and as we make our way through, I came across a great list in the last couple of weeks, and I was so encouraged by how this writer phrased it, and it just kind of captures the gist, if you will, each phrase just kind of capturing the meaning of what that phrase communicates.
[time=1651] And so I've provided that for you there.
[time=1653] This phrase, my friends, I believe is about relationship.
[time=1659] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1662] In a way that no other phrase can, this phrase, shepherd, sets the God of the Bible, the God of biblical Christianity, apart from all other religious deity.
[time=1676] The gods, small gee, the gods of religion are, as most of you know, very distant and demanding.
[time=1684] They exist in a world of ritual rules and severe expectations.
[time=1690] The God of the Bible, David says, here at the outset of this great Psalm, the God of the Bible, he says, is an intimately involved caregiver.
[time=1700] So much so that he gives him, David attributes to him this title, this phrase of shepherd.
[time=1710] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1714] He's in relationship with us, David reminds us.
[time=1717] He's in a close and intimate relationship with you and I.
[time=1721] He is, as any good shepherd would be, he is close in proximity, and he is near and aware and engaged in the every need of your life.
[time=1734] There is nothing he doesn't see.
[time=1736] There is nothing that he isn't keenly aware of.
[time=1739] There is nothing that transpires that he doesn't give attention to.
[time=1743] He is the great shepherd.
[time=1747] David reminds you and he reminds me that he is my shepherd.
[time=1755] The Lord, say that.
[time=1759] Say that with me. Just say it with me.
[time=1761] The Lord is who's?
[time=1768] Who's?
[time=1770] You kind of feel weird saying that, that God is yours.
[time=1774] He's your shepherd.
[time=1776] I mean, there's a part of us, I know that might cringe internally with that, but don't cringe.
[time=1781] No, this morning, be so grateful that the Lord God is your, yours.
[time=1789] He's your shepherd.
[time=1792] He's giving care and oversight to you.
[time=1796] You see, when you live in, watch this, when you live in proper submission, when you, when you function as a good sheep, all right, there's good sheep and there's not so good sheep.
[time=1808] There's sheep that follow.
[time=1810] There are sheep that go along with where the shepherd's going and what the shepherd's doing and how the shepherd's leading.
[time=1818] There are good sheep that live in an appropriate arena of submission.
[time=1824] And when you, and when you live in that proper submission as a sheep to the great shepherd, I love that phrase, the great shepherd, Hebrews 1320.
[time=1834] I think it'll come on the screen there for you.
[time=1836] The writer of Hebrews said it right there.
[time=1838] Now the God of peace who brought up from the dead, the great shepherd is how he's described.
[time=1845] The great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus, our Lord, when you live in proper submission as a sheep to the great shepherd, he will and those he has put in authority.
[time=1861] And I've got to stop right there.
[time=1865] And I just got to tell you that that concept right there, there is the great shepherd, our Lord.
[time=1872] He is my shepherd.
[time=1874] And the way the Lord designed this program is that he has seen fit to bring others into the mix.
[time=1882] He has allowed others to be, if you will, under shepherds.
[time=1886] He's called them to lead and love his flock.
[time=1891] They're called elders, pastors.
[time=1895] And as I teach about this, as we talk about this this morning, I've just got to tell you that it absolutely scares me to death sometimes.
[time=1906] It absolutely leaves me shaking in my shoes.
[time=1912] The thought that he would hold me accountable and place on my
[time=1920] shoulders and in my life and those who help me lead your spiritual, your physical, spiritual, emotional, relational, your safety, your feeding, the guiding that takes place, one protection that a shepherd is to...when we're talking about God doing that, that's one thing.
[time=1942] When we're talking about humans trying to do that for him, as flawed as they can be.
[time=1950] Oh, it's a scary thought.
[time=1953] And it humbles me.
[time=1955] And I know there are times I don't do it well.
[time=1958] Talk about being scary.
[time=1960] There you are on the other end of that at times.
[time=1963] God, by a fallen, frail, fractured shepherd who's trying his best and not always, I understand.
[time=1972] But that's how he designed it.
[time=1974] He wants you loved and cared for and led and fed and guarded and protected and he gives you shepherds to help do that.
[time=1986] And that's what he promises to do.
[time=1989] And we've talked about this in the past and you can just picture the imagery of a shepherd and his sheep on a hillside picture, the animals out in the darkness who would love to feast on those
[time=2003] sheep.
[time=2004] You can think about the pitfalls that are around the bend.
[time=2007] You can think about the inclement weather that shows up.
[time=2010] You can think about the physical needs of the sheep.
[time=2013] You can think about broken bones and sheep that wander.
[time=2016] You can think about all that goes on in that picture and know in the heart that the Lord is your shepherd.
[time=2023] And he is going to guard you and guide you and feed you and protect you and lead you and love you.
[time=2032] And even if you make it necessary, discipline you.
[time=2038] To bring you back home.
[time=2042] And as I think about that personally and as I would invite you this morning to just try and make some personal application there, I'll just tell it to you this way.
[time=2050] I can't begin to tell you how many times in a given day I need
[time=2057] me personally how much I need his guarding, his guiding, his
[time=2066] protecting, his discipline.
[time=2071] And if you live in the same world I live in, if you live in the midst of the same society and culture that I'm living in, if you live in the midst of the same pressures and the same expectations and the same temptations that I'm living in, then I know you need, you need a shepherd.
[time=2091] You need someone intimately involved with you.
[time=2094] Giving the kind of care and guidance and direction and protection that you and I desperately need.
[time=2103] And I think about it this way, I think you know there are so many in the room this morning and I know that you have a relationship with him.
[time=2109] I know there are many here who have fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=2113] And so when I realized that, you know, like in my own case, I mean even though that's a struggle at times, boy, I'm so thankful that the Lord is my shepherd and that I have in relationship with him access to that kind of leadership and guidance and protection.
[time=2130] And my heart breaks for you.
[time=2134] Those of you here in this room, those of you watching the broadcast, those of you listening on the Internet, my heart breaks for you.
[time=2143] Those of you that don't know him.
[time=2146] Those of you that haven't fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=2151] Is all you've got guarding and guiding and loving and protecting you is you.
[time=2158] And you and I both know how that goes.
[time=2164] David begins by reminding us of this great truth, the Lord.
[time=2168] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=2172] Amen?
[time=2174] Let it be so.
[time=2178] I shall not want.
[time=2180] Go ahead.
[time=2181] Look at the next phrase there.
[time=2182] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=2183] I shall not want.
[time=2185] That, my friends, is all about supply.
[time=2189] And I want you to think about this with me.
[time=2191] Look at Psalm 34.
[time=2192] Go over just a few pages to Psalm 34.
[time=2195] 34, 8 to 10.
[time=2197] It says in Psalm 34, 8 to 10.
[time=2199] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[time=2202] How blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
[time=2206] Oh, fear the Lord, you, his saints.
[time=2208] For to those who fear him, there is no what?
[time=2211] Say it.
[time=2212] The young lions do lack and suffer hunger.
[time=2215] But they who seek the Lord shall not be in want of any good thing.
[time=2222] It says in Philippians 4, 19 that God will supply all our what?
[time=2227] Needs.
[time=2228] According to his riches in glory.
[time=2231] Now here's the deal on this.
[time=2232] So many times when you hear people talk or teach about God's supplying, anytime you turn on the TV or you're reading a magazine article, sometimes when folks go down this road of describing how God supplies,
[time=2248] the teaching or the conversation can end up going to our wants.
[time=2254] It's my perspective, my opinion.
[time=2256] I believe sometimes that conversation starts to go toward our wants, not our needs.
[time=2263] They start talking about in those teachings or discussions, they oftentimes start talking about stuff, supplying stuff instead of true
[time=2274] spiritual supply, which I believe this text here addresses.
[time=2279] My friends, this phrase, you see it there.
[time=2283] So I'm 23.
[time=2285] I shall not want.
[time=2290] My friends, this phrase isn't about a new 50-inch plasma.
[time=2295] All right?
[time=2298] This is not what he's addressing.
[time=2302] This isn't about a new vacation destination, my friends.
[time=2306] It's about something far more important.
[time=2309] My friends understand that foundationally every one of us was in need of something far
[time=2315] greater and far more significant than a car, a home, a help with a payment or a bag
[time=2322] of groceries.
[time=2323] You see, as fallen human beings, you and I needed what we really needed was,
[time=2329] and what this text, I believe, addresses is our need for grace, our need for forgiveness,
[time=2337] our need for hope.
[time=2339] If you want to talk about what you and I needed, what we needed was redemption.
[time=2344] We needed to be transformed.
[time=2346] And you know what?
[time=2347] He supplied our need.
[time=2351] He supplied it perfectly.
[time=2353] He supplied it abundantly.
[time=2355] He supplied it overwhelmingly.
[time=2357] And I may not have the 50-inch plasma.
[time=2362] You may not get the stuff.
[time=2364] You may.
[time=2365] You may not.
[time=2366] But it ain't about the stuff.
[time=2367] When we talk about God's supply, when we talk about the need that he meets, it is about the fact that in his love and in his faithfulness and in his redemptive
[time=2378] plan, he saved you.
[time=2381] And that's what you needed.
[time=2382] You needed to be saved.
[time=2385] And now you and I have no more want.
[time=2390] The need has been completely and absolutely met.
[time=2396] The Lord.
[time=2398] Say it with me.
[time=2399] The Lord is what?
[time=2401] My shepherd.
[time=2402] I shall not what?
[time=2405] He makes me, it says, verse two.
[time=2407] He makes me, I'm going to combine these two on one slide there for you.
[time=2411] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=2413] I believe that's all about the rest that God brings to your soul.
[time=2419] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=2422] He leads me beside quiet, or your translation may read still waters.
[time=2428] And that's refreshment.
[time=2432] My friends, I believe with all my heart that God longs.
[time=2436] Listen, that God longs to meet you.
[time=2441] That God longs because he's a good shepherd.
[time=2445] And because he wants to meet that need, I believe God longs to meet you.
[time=2452] On an individual and extremely personal level in a very quiet place so that he can bring your weary, tired, stressed out heart.
[time=2466] The rest and the refreshment that it needs.
[time=2471] I love the physical imagery here David uses.
[time=2475] The imagery of nature to make this incredible spiritual point.
[time=2481] Where's some, think about it.
[time=2483] Where are some green, you got any green pasture you can go to?
[time=2488] Where's your green pasture?
[time=2490] Where's your quiet, where's your still water?
[time=2493] God I believe longs to meet with you at a very personal and intimate level because he's a good shepherd.
[time=2501] And he wants to bring refreshment and rest to your soul.
[time=2506] You know what some of you in the room might have a lake, I don't know.
[time=2509] You may have a literal body of water, you can walk out your backyard too.
[time=2514] I mean you may have a meadow right next door.
[time=2518] And you may take a blanket out there and sit down and open up the scriptures and that might all just work beautifully.
[time=2526] For most of us in the room this morning, I would suggest to you that your stream, that your quiet place, that your meadow probably is the dining room table.
[time=2538] About an hour before anybody else gets up.
[time=2542] Maybe it's a little desk over to the side in a room that doesn't get used.
[time=2546] Maybe it's a loft area, I don't know.
[time=2549] But I believe in your life and in mind there are places that we can go that are quiet.
[time=2556] Where we can meet with him, where we can communicate with him, where we can read his word, where we can study the scriptures, where we can listen to what he might have to say,
[time=2566] where we can meditate on certain truths, where we can maybe answer some questions and give some thought to some principles, where we can have times of personal worship.
[time=2577] And here's the point, he's such a good shepherd and he longs to meet your need and he knows that if you don't walk by the quiet waters,
[time=2591] and if you don't visit the green pasture, if you don't respond in a way that allows you to connect with him at that level on a regular basis, he knows you'll die.
[time=2606] And you will, you will die, you will, your heart will wither up and shrink and you will die.
[time=2614] You will slowly fade away into compromise and disobedience and the succumbing to temptation when you and I aren't taking in that water, walking along that stream, sitting in that pasture, spending time with him.
[time=2630] One of the reasons I'm so thankful for the book that you're going to get today is it gives many of you in the room who currently aren't doing that.
[time=2638] Somehow you still kind of think you can kind of eat, buy and work your way through the week 24/7, kind of just winging it, thinking about it, maybe.
[time=2652] You glance at it, you might pick it up, you might look through a note or two from a Sunday, but God wants to meet with you on a regular basis because he knows the temptations you're facing.
[time=2665] He knows the circumstances that you're confronted with. He understands the pressures that come at your soul and your heart and your life.
[time=2676] And he wants you to lie down in green pastures and walk beside still waters and take him in so you can live.
[time=2686] So you can live the life that he calls you to live. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=2698] He leads me beside quiet waters. It says he makes you lie down, he leads you, understand that there's that tension. God is so committed to bringing you and I to these places.
[time=2713] He knows, he knows, you have to set the alarm, don't you? He knows you have to get up when the alarm goes off, don't you?
[time=2727] An army of angels don't come into your room and lift you up off your bed and with song and voice carry you in. No, you've got to get up out of bed, knock off the alarm, grab a cup of coffee and you've got to go sit down and meet with your God.
[time=2742] And that's where he says he wants to save your life, he wants to give you and your heart, the renewal and the rest that it needs.
[time=2750] He restores my soul. Verse 3, look at that. He restores my soul. He's my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down by green pastures and leads me beside quiet waters.
[time=2761] He restores all that leads to a restoration of the soul. That's healing, my friends. Write that down. He restores my soul. That is healing, divine healing.
[time=2775] The word there restores a great word, it means to make right or whole. It means to bring back to fullness, that which was empty.
[time=2785] It's very similar to the word we looked at last week in Ephesians 4 where we talked about our speech being edifying. We said it was a medical term that meant to mend that which was broken, to make healthy again, not to diminish.
[time=2799] Almost the exact same word here in the Hebrew, to make right. He makes right your soul. He brings your soul back to fullness. That which was empty is now filled with him.
[time=2815] I know many of you in this room, many of you know me. And I know story after story after story in this room right here this morning of people who were utterly and absolutely empty.
[time=2835] I mean there was nothing left in the tank. The crack was enormous. And he patched up that crack and he made you new and he filled your soul again with all that's right and good and true.
[time=2854] And not only did he do that when he saved you but he does that day after day after day as he sanctifies us, as he grows us in our faith simply and succinctly. If you're here today or watching the broadcast and you have fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, not religion to Christ, then he has restored your empty soul. He has healed you.
[time=2881] Now again be careful where you go with that because the reality of life in a fallen world means this my friends. Physically you're going to die.
[time=2892] We understand that right? Right? You're going to die. Your children will die. Your moms and dads will die. Relatives and loved ones will pass away.
[time=2906] There will be suffering. There will be loss. You and I will experience unimaginable levels of pain and hurt as we see the sinfulness of this world and the brokenness of this place carried out in all kinds of brutal ways.
[time=2929] Yet as Christ followers, here's the great truth, as Christ followers in the midst of whatever physical pain we may face, there exists out before us the eternal reality that we have been made whole. We have been restored.
[time=2945] We have been ultimately, don't miss this, we have been ultimately healed.
[time=2951] And it helps me. It has helped me so many times to be in certain circles. I'll be in conversations. We'll be talking as a staff. I'll be at lunch with a friend.
[time=2961] I've heard Steve Longbrake say it many times. I've heard other guys who have seen more life than I have say this. I've heard some of you say it to me in different settings.
[time=2971] They'll talk about how when someone passes away, and that someone might be 10, that someone might be 40, that someone might be 80, but they'll remind me that in the passing, God healed them.
[time=2985] They've been healed. Right?
[time=2989] We think the medicine didn't work. We sometimes think in our humanist, the surgery wasn't a success, but in reality, they have been divinely what?
[time=2998] Healed.
[time=3000] Steve mentioned this to me in between services. I was so thankful. Isaiah 57, they can probably grab this and put it up for us. Isaiah 57, 1 and 2, oh, I listened to this.
[time=3019] He restores my soul, my friends. That's what Psalm 23 says. He heals us. Isaiah 57, 1 and 2 says, "The righteous man perishes, and no man takes its heart, and development are taken away while no one understands, for the righteous man is taken away from what?" Say it.
[time=3041] Evil. The righteous man is taken away from evil, God's word says. He enters into what? Peace. They rest in their beds, each one who walked in his upright way.
[time=3058] It's what he does. He restores. Sometimes that ultimate restoration happens after a long and prosperous life, and sometimes that healing comes early.
[time=3069] What you and I need to be reminded of today is that no matter what we might encounter, no matter what God may allow, we have been brought back to fullness.
[time=3080] That which was broken has been made right. Look at the next phrase there in Psalm 23. He guides me in paths of righteousness.
[time=3093] He guides me in paths of righteousness, and you see the phrase there. That's what we call guidance, my friends.
[time=3100] Righteousness, big word for some, understand that in this context, and you can just write this down if you'd like, in this context, you could just say, "He guides me in paths of right living."
[time=3115] Not a surprise, is it? He's a good shepherd. And when you live in that appropriate submission with him, he wants to take you down paths, and he will.
[time=3127] He will guide you. And if you follow, as he meets your need, as he restores your soul, he guides you down paths of good decisions and right living, proper God honoring relationships.
[time=3142] It's the way it works. It's the kind of shepherd that he is. He doesn't guide you to harm and danger. He guides you towards that, which is right.
[time=3153] He leads you in paths of right living. And that is the kind of guidance I know you need. That is the kind of guidance I know I need.
[time=3162] And my life, my life is full. I could give you an embarrassing list of paths that I've forged on my own when he was wanting to guide me down paths of right living, paths that I chose to go down, paths that I chose to pursue,
[time=3188] desires I thought were appropriate. Maybe I knew they were inappropriate, but I just wanted it.
[time=3198] And it's not right living. I'm the great shepherd who wants to bring you to this place of rest, has to then come back and find the trail and go grab you and grab you on the neck and whack you with the rod a few times and bring you back to the pen.
[time=3213] And he does that because he's a good shepherd. He longs to lead you and I down paths of right living. He longs to guide you for his name's sake.
[time=3224] Let me just tell you this. I love, I love, I've grown to love this phrase. It was a little confusing at first, but watch this. What does that mean?
[time=3235] What does it mean that he is my shepherd, he meets my need, he makes me lie down, he leads me by quiet waters, he restores my soul, he guides me down paths of right living for his name's sake.
[time=3251] What do you think that means? Somebody could read that and I think properly surmised that there's something in there where we're kind of supposed to get this picture or this idea that he wants his name,
[time=3264] he wants his name out there. As you and I live in this relationship with him, as you and I follow him, as you and I live in appropriate levels of submission to him, his name kind of gets noticed, his name kind of gets thrown out there, his name gets recognized.
[time=3281] And you know what? It's true. But in the next question, some will ask us, so what's the deal with him and his name? Why does he want to do all that for his name's sake? What is he some egotist? No.
[time=3297] No, no, no, no, no, you've missed the point. He's not an egotist. He's a good shepherd and he knows that at his name, every need will what? And every tongue will what? He wants his name out there so people can call on him so people can know him so people can submit him because he wants to restore their soul.
[time=3320] He wants to be their good shepherd. He wants to lead them by still waters. You with me?
[time=3327] The glory of his name, when you and I, as the community of Christ followers, live out this relationship with him, much is made of his name. Not you, not me, him. And when his name is known, when all of that right living is connected to his name being known, he has the opportunity to see others come into that same relationship that he so enjoys with you and me.
[time=3356] Now, I will say this, most people, as we make our way through verses 1, 2, and 3, talking about him being our shepherd and not being in want and green pastures and quiet waters and the restoring of a soul and the guiding down paths of right living, most folks go, "Wow, I like this. This is good." And then they come to verse 4.
[time=3376] "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death." And you know what, my friends? That's how it goes. That is where the trail leads. That is the walk with him. That is the reality of our life and our relationship with him.
[time=3397] He allows you and I, as sheep, to walk through very dark, very stormy valleys where faith is tested, where trust is strengthened.
[time=3411] And it is an amazing thing. First three verses, boy, I tell you, most folks are raising their hand, jumping in. Fourth verse comes along and all of a sudden you realize this could get, this could get dicey, and it does.
[time=3425] But in that valley, in the midst of that test, he is, don't forget verse 1, he is the good shepherd. And I'll give you the rest of this. I'll just lay it out for you on the website this week. You can just go to it tomorrow and we'll have it there.
[time=3439] You can also get that book on your way out and you can follow up with your own study on the things that we've talked about this morning. It is a fantastic chapter. It is a great six verses.
[time=3449] And our hope is that you will read it, memorize it, learn from it, be encouraged. And you know what? If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to let us know. We'd love to help.
[time=3460] I want you to stand. Let me close us in a word of prayer this morning.
[time=3466] Father, God, what a great beginning to a summer of study here in the book of Psalms. What a great, great book that speaks so directly, God, to the realities of our lives and the circumstances that we face. God, the condition of our hearts.
[time=3481] We pray that you would grow us. And God, I pray that those who are here this morning would come back and pray that we would, as a family, give ourselves to this discussion, that we would give ourselves, God, to what you have for us.
[time=3494] We want to be a people who live and walk and choose in the everyday of our life with healthy hearts, with souls that are truly restored and full, God not empty and searching.
[time=3507] God, I pray that we would see and realize again that that fullness is found only in you. God, I pray that you would grow each of us in that direction. And we'll thank you for it.
