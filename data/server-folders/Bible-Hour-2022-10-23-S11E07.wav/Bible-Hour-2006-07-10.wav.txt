[time=211] - Hi, my name's Sam Barfel,
[time=221] and I have the privilege of serving as the superintendent of Black Hawk Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=227] And Black Hawk Christian School has been in existence for just over 30 years, and I'd like to take this opportunity just to share some of the exciting things about what we get to do as a Christian school.
[time=237] First of all, we use a line around here that goes like this.
[time=240] We believe Black Hawk Christian School provides academic excellence on a biblical foundation, and there are two parts to that.
[time=246] The academic excellence is something that we pursue hard, and we have a rigorous curriculum that we challenge our students to give their very best and be the very best student that God's called them to be.
[time=257] But the other part of that is the biblical foundation.
[time=259] Everything that we teach comes from the truth of Scripture and the premise of everything we teach comes from that scriptural base.
[time=268] And that is what we call teaching truth.
[time=271] And then the other thing I'd like to tell you about is our faculty.
[time=273] We just have an incredible team of people who make up the teachers and the faculty, the staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=280] And these people have given their professional lives and their ministry lives to serving the students that God has by His sovereignty placed right here in our school to provide that academic excellence on a biblical foundation.
[time=294] And it is my pleasure to work next and alongside those who are the faculty and staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=301] They are second to none.
[time=301] I'm convinced of that.
[time=303] And I would like to just encourage you and challenge you during these summer months as you're thinking about next fall, school starting up again, to think about and explore the possibility of your child, your students becoming part of the family here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=318] And I would challenge you to give us a call and let us give you what we call a tour and a talk.
[time=323] Walk through our facilities so you can catch kind of a heart glimpse of what we're about and what we're trying to accomplish and how we're trying to partner with parents who want their children to walk in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ.
[time=335] And how that and education are just seamlessly welded together in such a powerful way.
[time=341] And so I invite you to give us a call, get on our website and contact us and let us give you some more information about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=351] Thanks so much.
[time=352] We look forward to hearing from you.

[time=669] - My name is Dave Walters.
[time=677] I am the college pastor here.
[time=678] I lead the ministry we have called Encounter, which is 18 to 25 year olds.
[time=684] I'm having a blast.
[time=685] I know some of you parents who have 18 to 25 year olds involved, you keep apologizing about how late they stay.
[time=692] We usually have three events a night and sometimes I'm up to maybe one in the morning.
[time=697] But you know what?
[time=698] That's me.
[time=699] That's who I am.
[time=700] I love it.
[time=701] I'm challenged by it.
[time=702] I still have the mindset of a 20-something.
[time=704] Sometimes I'm as mature as that.
[time=706] So I just love it and just give you an idea of some of the things that are happening.
[time=713] And we have three events a week.
[time=715] And about a week ago, I was gone.
[time=718] And so I said, well, we're gonna meet tonight.
[time=719] We're not gonna meet the rest of this week and next week we'll be back on.
[time=723] Well, nah, we're meeting anyway.
[time=725] It's at my house.
[time=726] Okay, you'll bring this, you'll do that.
[time=727] Okay, fine.
[time=728] And they just left me out.
[time=730] And so I'm starting to feel a little like I'm disposable here.
[time=734] But you know, it's great.
[time=734] It's their take an ownership, their love guide, their, it's awesome.
[time=740] It's, I'm challenged all the time.
[time=742] The other thing I'm excited about is there's a conference called Passion 07.
[time=746] And we took some about six or seven students their last year.
[time=751] And I thought, boy, if we could get eight or so this year, that'd be awesome.
[time=754] And we already have like 10 to 12, you know, already signed up.
[time=758] And it's just, it's a great conference.
[time=760] You know, I'm not a big conference person, but I love this one.
[time=763] And so there's something happening in that age group in this city.
[time=767] And it's just not here at Blackhawk, it's in this city.
[time=769] About half the people are Blackhawk.
[time=771] The other half are from other churches around the area.
[time=773] So it's a great opportunity for Blackhawk to collaborate and to work with other churches to really help and minister to this age group.
[time=781] That's desperately needed.
[time=782] And this morning, we are going to take a journey in space.
[time=787] I love space, I always have.
[time=790] And so if you're with me and you love space, you're going to love this morning.
[time=795] If you don't get into like stars and everything, I hope I can pull you into it, but if I can't, it may be a long morning.
[time=802] But I think you're going to like it.
[time=804] We're going to go ahead and read Psalm 19 one through six again.
[time=809] Tonya read it and we're going to read again.
[time=812] If you could stand with me and read this in honor of God's word.
[time=817] Psalm 19, we're going to read verses one through six.
[time=820] The heavens declare the glory of God.
[time=826] The skies proclaim the work of his hands.
[time=830] Day after day, they pour forth speech.
[time=833] Night after night, they display knowledge.
[time=837] There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.
[time=842] Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.
[time=847] In the heavens, he has pitched a tent for the sun, which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
[time=856] It rises at one end of the heavens and it's circuit to the other.
[time=861] Nothing is hidden from its heat.
[time=864] You can be seated.
[time=866] When I was asked to kind of be part of the team
[time=872] that is going to do summer in the Psalms, right away I thought Psalm 19.
[time=876] And to be honest, I didn't care what you needed.
[time=879] I just love Psalm 19 because it has to do with space.
[time=883] So no, not really.
[time=884] And so I'm going to take you on a journey.
[time=886] What I want to do is I want to, we're going to talk about what the glory of God, what that is, but what I want to try to do is stretch your mind this morning.
[time=896] When Jesus walked the earth, he used things that were known to explain what was unknown.
[time=902] Though he used agriculture, he used military, he used sports to describe the kingdom of God.
[time=909] They knew about agriculture, they knew about armies, and they knew about sports and competition, but they did not know the kingdom of God.
[time=915] What I want to do, trying to discover the glory of God, we're going to use something that we're pretty familiar with and that's space.
[time=924] When we look up, we see stars, we see planets, we've probably seen those pictures.
[time=928] So I want to use those to try to help us get our arms around who God is.
[time=934] One definition of glory of God is when we see God for who he is, that is God's glory.
[time=941] So we're going to try to do that.
[time=942] It's not going to be possible.
[time=943] We can't comprehend God.
[time=944] We can't comprehend things that are just way out there.
[time=947] And this is way out there, okay?
[time=949] So this is your, you have to participate with me.
[time=952] This is what you must do.
[time=953] When I put pictures up there, and when I start giving facts, don't write them down.
[time=959] Don't take notes.
[time=960] I mean, if you want to, if you're that type of person, great, but try to comprehend the magnitude of it.
[time=967] So when you see a picture of earth up there on the screen, try in your mind to get your arms around the magnitude of that planet.
[time=976] And if you need to write down, that's great.
[time=978] But you got to do that with me.
[time=979] You got to stretch your mind here.
[time=981] When I was growing up, when I was a kid, I grew up here in Fort Wayne, I was born and raised here.
[time=986] I grew up on the southeast side close to the, to Harding High School.
[time=990] So we were like right on the edge of the city.
[time=992] And when I would get anxious or when I'd get frustrated at something, I have three older sisters, no brothers on the baby of my family, none of them are here.
[time=1001] So I had a really tough childhood.
[time=1003] And they can't refute that part of, I brought it on myself.
[time=1007] But when I'd get frustrated or something at night, I would go outside, lay down in the grass and just stare at space.
[time=1014] And whatever I was anxious about, whatever I was frustrated about, whatever I was mad about, somehow would dissipate.
[time=1022] And as I'd look into space and I'd see these stars and I'd try to, you know, try to let my eyes adjust and try to see even further.
[time=1030] And I would try to get my arms around how big that was.
[time=1032] I had a lot of times, imagine it was just a big, it was still daytime, but this big blanket was covered over it and pinholes are put in it.
[time=1040] And I'd try to think of that thinking, that's incredible how big that is.
[time=1043] And my mind would just get lost in that.
[time=1045] And somehow my problems, my issues just kind of seemed to kind of get real small.
[time=1052] And so I did that, I kept doing that.
[time=1055] I did that even at Purdue.
[time=1057] You know, I'd get anxious about something.
[time=1059] I would take a walk.
[time=1059] There's a place called Slater Hill at Purdue.
[time=1062] It's kind of out on the side of campus and that's where they had outdoor concerts.
[time=1066] And I would lay down on that hill and I would look up at space and do the exact same thing.
[time=1070] We moved to Colorado and in Colorado, the stars are brilliant 'cause you're a mile higher so there's a lot less interference, atmospheric interference.
[time=1078] And it was brilliant, especially if you go up to the mountains.
[time=1080] If you go to Colorado and you go up to the mountains at night, go outside and look up.
[time=1087] You will be amazed at what you see.
[time=1089] We'll be there in a couple of weeks.
[time=1090] I'm gonna do that probably every night.
[time=1093] Even now, we have a screened in porch in our back behind our house and I tore out the ceiling and I tore out the wall so that when I sit on our bench swing, I can look up at space.
[time=1104] I wanted to tear a hole in the roof but my wife stopped me before I could get to that.
[time=1109] Just because I love, there's something about looking to space that tends to put me in perspective in life.
[time=1117] It's almost like there's this, based on Psalm 19, there's this spiritual interaction that happens when we look and gaze and meditate on space.
[time=1128] So I'm gonna try to do that for you this morning.
[time=1131] We're gonna also kind of bring things to scale a little bit to try to help you get your arms around how big space is.
[time=1139] And if space is this big and this grand, what must the creator be like?
[time=1144] That's kind of the thought here, okay?
[time=1145] We're gonna talk about God's glory at the end.
[time=1148] So the first picture, you guys ready to do this?
[time=1151] First picture is the sun.
[time=1154] Okay, this is the sun.
[time=1156] It's 93 million miles away from us.
[time=1159] Not a big deal.
[time=1161] See that thing up in the top right?
[time=1163] That's called a solar flare.
[time=1164] That happens when there's a lot of energy that gets created and it just bursts and just kind of fire kind of bursts out.
[time=1172] It's called a flare and it's kind of like a volcano.
[time=1177] Those things happen quite a bit.
[time=1179] And just to give you an aspect of the size compared to Earth, the next slide's gonna show on the sides, they're gonna show you how big the Earth is on that flare.
[time=1188] The little blue ball, that's us.
[time=1191] We live on Earth by the way, just in case you didn't know.
[time=1194] That's Earth, that's us.
[time=1196] That's us in that little solar flare there.
[time=1197] That's our size.
[time=1199] If you take 109 Earths, you can go from one dot the diameter of the sun.
[time=1205] From one side to the other, 109 Earths.
[time=1209] The sun is so big that you could put 333,000 Earths inside it.
[time=1216] That's how big the sun is.
[time=1219] Are you tracking?
[time=1220] The sun is big.
[time=1222] The Earth is big.
[time=1224] The sun is big.
[time=1225] Now the sun is one of billions of stars, it was one of a billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is a galaxy, which is one of a billion galaxies.
[time=1235] And we're just an average galaxy, we're not that great of a galaxy, we're just kind of Joe average.
[time=1239] And you know what, the sun, God gave us an average sun.
[time=1243] I mean, this is not like the cool one, this is not the stud star, this is just an average Joe star to heat us up.
[time=1249] And I'm glad it's exactly the size it is, it produces as much heat it is, because any more, we'd burn up.
[time=1258] Any less, we'd freeze, we'd die.
[time=1261] So this is exactly what we need to sustain life.
[time=1264] Speaking of heat, the sun produces enough heat in one second to give enough energy for us on Earth to survive for a thousand years.
[time=1274] One second of heat produces enough energy for us to survive for a thousand years.
[time=1280] So the sun is pretty important to us, it's a pretty big star.
[time=1284] Okay, next.
[time=1286] Next planet, Mercury.
[time=1289] Mercury is 3,000 miles across.
[time=1293] Now, to give you a perspective, oh, I forgot to tell you, show you these.
[time=1296] Look at these.
[time=1297] These are some of two favorite books.
[time=1299] This one is like an Atlas, which has all kinds of interesting facts.
[time=1302] Most of the facts I got from here are in here, and I had to change them to like miles and stuff for ya, 'cause it's all kilometers.
[time=1310] So this is kind of a cool thing.
[time=1312] I like this one better because there's no words in it.
[time=1314] It's all pictures.
[time=1316] So most of the pictures you're seeing is from this book.
[time=1319] And if you're really into this stuff, you can go to nasa.com and do the picture of a day, that you can actually see these things, the picture of a day up here.
[time=1327] So if you get into this stuff, which I hope you do, 'cause it's really cool, you can look at this.
[time=1331] Okay, so there's our sun.
[time=1334] There's the first planet, Mercury.
[time=1335] It's 3,000 miles across.
[time=1339] Now, if we want to do this to scale, okay, we're gonna do that with fruit.
[time=1345] Okay, first service.
[time=1348] I forgot what this was.
[time=1350] It's a honeydew melon.
[time=1352] So, here we go, but I know better now.
[time=1354] Okay, Mercury.
[time=1357] Okay, if there's two things we need to look at and you gotta separate 'em.
[time=1362] If the sun was this size, then I'm gonna show you how big Mercury would be.
[time=1369] Okay, if that was a sun, that's about 12 to 15 feet right there on that screen.
[time=1374] If the sun was that size, Mercury would be the size of this Cheerio, okay?
[time=1382] That's small, but it's 3,000 miles across.
[time=1386] Right now, so there's two things.
[time=1390] There's a size of the planet, then the distance.
[time=1393] Now, the distance is a different scale, so you're really gonna have to track with me here, okay?
[time=1396] I think we can do this.
[time=1397] I think we're pretty smart.
[time=1398] You look smart, okay?
[time=1400] Now, if the size is the same, it would be this.
[time=1405] Now, when it comes to distance, if the sun was the size of this quarter on the screen right now, then this would be right out here under the street light.
[time=1418] State and lay mire, right at the corner of state and lay mire.
[time=1422] So if the sun was the size of this quarter on this screen, this Cheerio would be in the intersection of state and lay mire.
[time=1433] Okay, we're talking, that's some distance right there.
[time=1436] I mean, you just can't walk that in a day.
[time=1437] That's not like a day trip.
[time=1439] So here's Mercury, we're gonna put Mercury right here.
[time=1442] Okay, the next planet is Venus.
[time=1448] This is 7,500 miles wide.
[time=1452] Now, that's 7,500 miles wide.
[time=1458] If the sun was that big, it's a marshmallow, okay?
[time=1463] The sun at 1.1 inches, which is a quarter, this would be out in our soccer field.
[time=1469] So our soccer field, if there's a parking lot on this side, you kind of go down that little hill, then there's a church right across.
[time=1476] Somewhere in that grassy place is this marshmallow.
[time=1478] This is Venus.
[time=1480] Venus is right here and the 1.1 inches of a sun is right there.
[time=1484] That's the distance, okay?
[time=1486] This is a big universe, okay?
[time=1487] But we're in our neighborhood right now.
[time=1489] We haven't even left our neighborhood, guys.
[time=1491] So we're moving.
[time=1492] So here's Venus right there.
[time=1495] Oh, sorry, yeah, that's Venus.
[time=1499] Okay, next is Earth, third rock from the sun.
[time=1502] Again, it's about the same size, be a marshmallow, at that.
[time=1508] It would be, if you go to the end of our property on the other campus, we have our North campus there, the end of that parking lot, there's a house, this marshmallow would be somewhere in their living room.
[time=1519] If the sun was the size of a quarter on this screen, that's the distance from the sun to Earth to scale.
[time=1525] So I'm gonna put the Earth right there.
[time=1528] Okay, next is Mars, 4,200 miles.
[time=1534] Mars would be a grape.
[time=1536] Okay, compared to that sun, it'd be a grape.
[time=1540] And if the sun was 1.1 inches, this would be an anchor room, probably in the music section somewhere, at anchor room, just on the corner of Stellhorn and Lemire, okay, a grape.
[time=1552] These aren't to scale, by the way, 'cause I'm not gonna run 'em out there.
[time=1558] Next, Jupiter.
[time=1562] Jupiter, interesting planet, we've never seen its surface, that's just, those are just clouds and gases that just kinda keep swirling around.
[time=1570] Interestingly enough, I mean, for you junkies, you would already know this, but in 1997, Jupiter was hit by some asteroids, and it went through, when it went through the clouds and gas, it kinda left a mark and it stayed there for a couple months, and everybody was all excited, it was real cool, and unless you're into that, that's just kinda information that you really don't care about.
[time=1589] But that did happen, I can promise you that.
[time=1592] You can see it on nasa.com, too.
[time=1594] Honeydew, my honeydew melon.
[time=1597] This is the size of Jupiter, next to that.
[time=1599] Now, Jupiter's pretty big, but next to the sun, it's nothing.
[time=1603] And this, Jupiter, again, would just be just beyond anchor room, on the other side of anchor room.
[time=1611] You look at the difference here.
[time=1613] These are two planets.
[time=1614] Okay, here's Earth.
[time=1618] I mean, this is just a planet, this is kinda circling around the sun.
[time=1621] I don't want that to fall.
[time=1625] Okay, our baby watermelon would be Saturn,
[time=1632] which has the famous ring around it, 75,000 miles across.
[time=1636] This would be on the corner of St. Joe and Maple Crest.
[time=1639] If you go, if you go all the way, I'm sorry, yeah, St. Joe and Maple Crest, the Zesto higher ground, the grocery store, this would be somewhere in Zesto parking lot.
[time=1650] Okay, pretty convenient place to be if you're Saturn.
[time=1653] So, 75,000 miles across, if that was 1.1 inches, this would be in the Zesto parking lot.
[time=1659] Very cold, by the way.
[time=1661] By the rings, the rings are really interesting.
[time=1663] The rings are, you know, those are a light year across.
[time=1666] I mean, it's just, that's just too much information.
[time=1669] It's just unbelievable.
[time=1670] It's just, you know, keep track in here.
[time=1672] Okay, don't get confused by all the data.
[time=1674] Don't let the data kinda go over your head.
[time=1676] Just try to grab it and try to comprehend it.
[time=1679] That we're talking about, this was created stuff.
[time=1683] And the person who created it, it didn't take him forever and a lot of blood, sweat and tears, he just kinda spoke it into existence.
[time=1690] So, we have a creator that's pretty incredible.
[time=1694] And we're gonna get together the glory of God.
[time=1695] These here are just declaring the glory of God.
[time=1699] Okay, the next planet, it's called Uranus.
[time=1706] This is 32,000 miles across.
[time=1709] Now, this planet would be in New Haven.
[time=1712] Okay, New Haven is about four and a half miles
[time=1718] straight that way.
[time=1719] On the corner of 469 and 30, if you got on 469 and drove and you went over 30, this would be right there.
[time=1726] Hey, this is this planet.
[time=1727] And you're that, and that's if this was 1.1 inches, this is in New Haven.
[time=1732] Now, you won't see this apple, but it's there.
[time=1736] And the heat hits it, warms it up.
[time=1739] Neptune, the great big blue planet is what they call it.
[time=1749] You know where Cedarville is?
[time=1752] Just north of DuPont Road.
[time=1753] Or if you're heading to Warsaw, you get on Colosseum.
[time=1756] And right when you go on, get on to 30, the interchange, that's where this would be.
[time=1760] Okay, this is 7.2 miles away.
[time=1763] Okay, to scale.
[time=1764] If that was 1.1 inches, this would be 7.2 miles away from it.
[time=1769] Okay, the solar system's a big, you know, this is big here.
[time=1773] This is not a family vacation.
[time=1775] This is like serious travel here.
[time=1780] Okay, in the last planet, Pluto, a small planet, it's hard to get a picture.
[time=1785] It's very hard to get out to really kind of see what it's made of.
[time=1789] Pluto is 1,400 miles across, and it's this popcorn kernel.
[time=1795] Okay, next to this, it's a popcorn kernel.
[time=1800] Okay, next to Earth, which is right here, that's Pluto, okay?
[time=1806] Now, this would be almost at the DeKalb-Alent County border.
[time=1813] Nine miles away, north of Grable, north of Leo.
[time=1818] This little popcorn kernel would be sitting here if the sun was 1.1 inches.
[time=1823] If the sun was this size right here, this would be like 17 billion miles away to scale.
[time=1832] Okay, I don't understand what I just said.
[time=1834] All I know is that this is like some 17 billion miles away.
[time=1837] That's why I had to do two different scales here to get this to work.
[time=1841] So even trying to comprehend it, you have to use two, I mean, it's just, our finite minds cannot absolutely comprehend it.
[time=1848] Now, the next picture will have all the planets on the same screen that shows sizes.
[time=1852] Those aren't exactly where they are.
[time=1853] They'd be way out here.
[time=1855] But that's kind of the different sizes.
[time=1858] It's unbelievable to me.
[time=1859] I could stare at this and just look at this and look at this and just go, wow.
[time=1864] Unbelievable.
[time=1866] And that's our neighborhood.
[time=1869] I don't think we'll ever travel there.
[time=1871] I mean, China, you know, you get jet-like with going to China.
[time=1875] And that's just on the other side of the earth.
[time=1878] Here you're talking, you know, it's just unbelievable.
[time=1880] And that's our galaxy.
[time=1881] Now, we're still in our galaxy, but let's go a little bit further.
[time=1885] It's called a nebula.
[time=1887] Nebula is just a bunch of gases together.
[time=1889] And this is called the Horsehead Nebula.
[time=1894] The next slide will go and kind of do a blow-up picture of that, which is like a horsehead.
[time=1898] Now, this is actually in space.
[time=1900] This isn't an artist's rendition.
[time=1901] This is a picture.
[time=1902] The Hubble telescope takes these pictures.
[time=1904] And this is what it comes back as.
[time=1907] This is 1,500 light years away.
[time=1913] So what does that mean?
[time=1914] Okay, I'm glad you asked.
[time=1916] A light year is if you would get in your car and go the speed of light for one year,
[time=1922] that's one light year.
[time=1924] Now, the speed of light travels at 5.9 trillion miles a year.
[time=1931] So you'd have to get in your car, get going to the speed of light, and travel 5.9 million miles.
[time=1938] And when you stopped, it'd be one year.
[time=1941] So if you, to get to this guy right here, you'd have to travel 1,500 years
[time=1947] at 5.9 trillion miles a year, no potty breaks, and you'd get there.
[time=1953] Okay, now, are we stretching it out a little bit?
[time=1955] Okay, we thought Pluto was pretty far out there.
[time=1958] I mean, this is way out there.
[time=1960] Remember, we worship a God that put these in space.
[time=1963] And the reason he put these out here is not really any scientific purpose.
[time=1968] The major reason, the primary reason that these are out here is to declare his glory.
[time=1974] Is to say, don't worship me, you should see the guy who created me.
[time=1978] You should see who created me.
[time=1979] That's why they're there.
[time=1980] So you're marveling at the size, you're marveling at my goodness, Pluto's, I mean, yeah, God created these for his glory.
[time=1988] Let's keep going out a little bit further.
[time=1991] This next one's called the ring nebula.
[time=1993] That's 2,000 light years away, and it's actually a cylinder.
[time=1997] So we're looking right down the barrel of it.
[time=1999] That's just a star, like it's our sun.
[time=2001] That's what's that little white spot in the middle.
[time=2002] There's another one kind of got in there too.
[time=2004] You don't know a big deal.
[time=2005] Just a sun that's probably 100 million miles.
[time=2007] I mean, that's just a light year from one end to the other.
[time=2011] So if you go from one side of the barrel to the other, it's only like six trillion miles.
[time=2016] So it's just a little thing out there.
[time=2018] But it's there saying, hey, God is incredible.
[time=2021] God is glorified.
[time=2022] Look at the one who created me.
[time=2024] That's the purpose of that.
[time=2025] That's 2,000 light years away.
[time=2029] Next is called the majestic swan nebula, 5,000 light years away.
[time=2039] So get in your car, 6 trillion miles a year for 5,000 years.
[time=2046] You'll be here.
[time=2046] You'll kind of come up on it.
[time=2049] And it's 15 light years across, by the way.
[time=2050] So just to go from one end to the other is 15 years.
[time=2053] So that kind of like a chunk of your life away to get there.
[time=2057] And the next one, eagle, the eagle's egg nebula.
[time=2061] And they call it that because it's like eagle's nest on the top of those pillars.
[time=2065] That is 7,000 light years away.
[time=2069] The actual pillars are a few light years in length.
[time=2072] So it would take you 10 to 20 trillion miles up and down.
[time=2080] And that's like 7,000 light years away.
[time=2083] Times 7,000 times 6 trillion, if your cell phone can do that, you've got a good cell phone.
[time=2088] So that's how far away that would be.
[time=2091] The next one, cloud of Carina, 8,000.
[time=2097] 8,000 light years away.
[time=2098] Are you tracking?
[time=2102] Are you trying to get your arms around this?
[time=2104] Tell me, we're 8,000 times 6 trillion miles away.
[time=2108] I mean, earth is big.
[time=2110] I mean, you can fly around in a day or two or whatever it takes.
[time=2114] But we're not talking about the earth, we're out here.
[time=2119] OK, what about other galaxies?
[time=2120] These are kind of still within our galaxy and dramata.
[time=2124] It's the nearest galaxy.
[time=2126] See that big spot on the bottom?
[time=2129] That's actually a star in our galaxy that kind of got in the way of the picture.
[time=2133] And so it shows a little bigger.
[time=2134] But that's the same thing up there on the top.
[time=2138] But that's the dramata galaxy.
[time=2141] The center is not one big mass.
[time=2143] Those are like billions of stars in there.
[time=2145] Remember, our sun, our average Joe's sun.
[time=2148] That would be like one of a billion in there.
[time=2150] And that's the dramata galaxy.
[time=2153] Get this.
[time=2155] That's 2 million light years away.
[time=2156] OK, get in your car for 2 million years,
[time=2163] travel 6 trillion miles a year.
[time=2166] You'll get to this.
[time=2167] Our closest neighbor.
[time=2170] OK, the next one.
[time=2172] The perfect spiral galaxy.
[time=2174] That's 30 million miles away.
[time=2177] 30 million light years away.
[time=2179] Over 100 billion stars in that little white core you see there.
[time=2184] And our sun's just an average one.
[time=2187] The next one, the warped galaxy, that's 150 miles.
[time=2194] 150 million light years away.
[time=2197] And it's warped because it kind of has spun.
[time=2199] It looks like it's been bent.
[time=2201] 100,000 light years across.
[time=2204] Another one.
[time=2205] These two galaxies actually collided.
[time=2210] You kind of see where it kind of spun off.
[time=2212] And it kind of created a mess.
[time=2214] They call this when mice collide.
[time=2216] I mean, some astronomer ran out of names.
[time=2219] When mice collide, it's kind of because they have the tails on it.
[time=2222] But these two galaxies collided, and kind of that's what you see in the middle there.
[time=2228] This is 300 million light years away.
[time=2231] That's a long trip.
[time=2237] 300 million.
[time=2237] But you know, God's out there.
[time=2239] He's watching over it.
[time=2240] It's doing fine.
[time=2241] He knew they were going to collide.
[time=2242] He probably said it in motion.
[time=2243] He made it happen because why?
[time=2245] It glorified him.
[time=2247] And he did that just to show off because he's God, and he can.
[time=2253] So the heavens declare the glory of God.
[time=2258] So let's talk about this glory of God.
[time=2259] What is the glory of God?
[time=2262] There's 25 terms in the Old Testament for glory.
[time=2266] In the English, we translate it glory every time.
[time=2269] But there's actually 25 Hebrew terms for glory.
[time=2273] One of those terms is almost always used only when God is glorifying himself.
[time=2282] So when God glorifies himself, the term is called kabod.
[time=2286] That's how you pronounce the Hebrew term.
[time=2288] It's kabod.
[time=2289] And that always means is when God glorifies himself.
[time=2292] Now there's two aspects to the term kabod.
[time=2296] And there's actually two responses.
[time=2299] The first response is God's.
[time=2302] When you see that the heavens declare the glory of God, God put the heavens out there to glorify himself, to show his own glory.
[time=2313] And the response is this.
[time=2314] The reason he did it is this.
[time=2316] The situation for the environment was that he was not getting the honor do him.
[time=2323] That the situation, the environment, he was not getting the appropriate honor, the appropriate worship.
[time=2331] And so he had to set it straight, so he glorified himself.
[time=2335] There's a number of scriptures that have this in here where God came down and glorified himself as a response as he wasn't getting the honor and the glory he deserved.
[time=2344] So he comes down and does it himself, kabod, k-a-b-o-d-e if you were taking notes.
[time=2349] And that's just one of the 25 terms, but it's only used when God uses it to glorify himself.
[time=2356] And he glorifies himself as a response because he's not getting the glory he deserves.
[time=2361] The heavens declare his glory.
[time=2367] We look at this, God is revealing himself.
[time=2371] Glory, the term glory means weighty density.
[time=2376] I mean, there's a meaning of it meaning light, the brightness, how bright something is, how weighty, how heavy, how important, how honorable, how majestic, how incredible.
[time=2389] I mean, we don't have words that kind of glory, such as one of those, it's a word so close to who God is.
[time=2395] We don't even have words to try to describe what glory is.
[time=2399] I mean, have you ever tried to describe God?
[time=2402] Is God big?
[time=2403] No, it's much bigger than big.
[time=2406] Is he huge?
[time=2408] No, 'cause he's huger than huge.
[time=2410] Is he majestic?
[time=2412] No, he's more majestic or more, I mean, there's just not a word that can describe who God is.
[time=2420] What about indescribable?
[time=2423] Well, yeah, that's just the negative of who God isn't.
[time=2428] He's not describable.
[time=2429] So what is a word that we can say that you go, oh, that's who God is?
[time=2433] Well, there are not, there are no words.
[time=2436] So what God has done is he comes down and he reveals his glory himself.
[time=2442] One of the definitions of glory of God is when we see God for who he is.
[time=2449] And so when we look at the stars, they're declaring his glory, they're saying, okay, yeah, we're big.
[time=2453] Yeah, I'm just a corn kernel nine miles away.
[time=2456] But God is incredible here.
[time=2458] I mean, he is huge.
[time=2459] His presence is unbelievable.
[time=2461] You want that.
[time=2462] I'm not it.
[time=2463] I'm not God.
[time=2464] I'm not even his glory.
[time=2465] I'm just declaring to you that God is weighty.
[time=2469] God is big.
[time=2471] God is majestic.
[time=2473] And there's someone in a guy named Lou Giglio who says God is, he's other.
[time=2477] That's the word he uses.
[time=2478] It's God is other.
[time=2481] There's no words, so it's something else.
[time=2483] In fact, scientists, it's interesting.
[time=2485] In this book here, they talk about how, of the universe we've only seen maybe 13% of it.
[time=2492] So 87% is invisible to us and it's out there.
[time=2495] And we don't have the science to really be able to go beyond this 13%.
[time=2500] But they have a hunch that the universe, the rest of the universe, this 87% is not space.
[time=2508] But it's something they're calling dark matter.
[time=2511] Dark matter, it's something, but we don't know what it is.
[time=2514] And they kind of have this computer simulation if I can find it.
[time=2517] I think it's at the end, yeah.
[time=2518] They just have a bunch of red fiber stuff.
[time=2521] And they say, yeah, this is what the universe is beyond what we can see.
[time=2524] It's something like this.
[time=2526] And I'm thinking, yeah, there's something else out there, but I'm not sure it's fibrous red stuff that you have in your book.
[time=2533] Maybe there is something out there.
[time=2535] Maybe that something out there is responsible for these things.
[time=2538] Maybe the reason that something out there that's responsible for these things put these things out there so that you'd see that, yeah, there's something else out there and it's a person.
[time=2544] It's God someone that deserves our glory, deserves our worship.
[time=2549] So the glory of God, the kabod, it's when he reveals himself, that's his response because he wasn't getting the appropriate worship, the repopiate response.
[time=2561] The second response to kabod, the first one is God seeing that he's not getting the proper worship and honor.
[time=2569] So he reveals himself, the second response is ours.
[time=2573] If you go to Psalm 19, 12, who can discern his heirs?
[time=2581] Forgive my hidden faults.
[time=2583] Keep your servant also from willful sins.
[time=2585] May they not rule over me.
[time=2587] They know I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression.
[time=2591] May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
[time=2599] Notice Psalm 19 starts with the heavens declare the kabod of God, that God glorifies himself.
[time=2608] God reveals himself because he wasn't being honored and worship in the right way.
[time=2614] Psalm 19 ends with our response.
[time=2617] There's a humbleness.
[time=2618] There's this idea that, you know what?
[time=2623] The center probably, the world probably does not revolve around me.
[time=2627] You know, people's lives are not revolving around Dave Walters.
[time=2632] Everything that happens on earth does not revolve around Dave.
[time=2636] In fact, this universe has less to do with me and more to do with something else.
[time=2644] Why?
[time=2644] Because the heavens are declaring the glory of God and they're saying God is other than anything you've ever seen, ever known and he's revealing himself to you.
[time=2656] And my response is, well, if that's the case, then I need to get in tune with him.
[time=2662] If that's the case, then I better find out what he's up to, find out what he's about, find out who he is so I can align my life to him.
[time=2670] And it goes on to saying verse 14, may the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord.
[time=2678] Now this verse 14, the context is a worship service like this.
[time=2683] And so it's when we all come together to worship him and to serve him together, what's the whole focus?
[time=2692] The words of my mouth, meditation of my heart be pleasing in your and your sight, O Lord.
[time=2700] Let me give you an example where I think maybe we kind of maybe miss the mark here.
[time=2707] We live in a consumer culture.
[time=2709] I don't think anyone would argue with that.
[time=2711] America, the West, you know, kind of even the world, we are a consumer nation.
[time=2715] If we want something, we go get it, we consume a lot.
[time=2718] Whether it's food, whether it's toys, whether it's stuff, information, we consume, consume, consume.
[time=2723] Here's what my fear is, is that we bring
[time=2729] that consumer mentality in here.
[time=2733] And I don't think God ever intended for us to be consumers in his presence.
[time=2738] And I'm guilty of this church.
[time=2741] I mean, I really am.
[time=2743] And here's examples, I come in here sometimes and I sit down and oh, I like the lighting here, the nice orange and nice blue.
[time=2750] Oh, the space behind those words, I was totally getting into that right there.
[time=2753] In fact, I'm starting to, oh, I'm 17.
[time=2755] That's NGC 222 35.
[time=2758] In fact, one of those pictures at the very beginning, they look like stars, those were galaxies.
[time=2763] Those from the Hubble telescope is the farthest picture they've ever taken.
[time=2767] And they actually got the angle down to like this much from Earth out there.
[time=2771] And they just got this band of galaxies, 15 million galaxies in that picture.
[time=2775] I know you probably thought it was stars, but it's actually galaxies.
[time=2777] I just wanted to set you straight there.
[time=2779] And so they're galaxies.
[time=2780] I'm totally getting into that.
[time=2781] I'm like, oh, I love the stars.
[time=2783] Yeah, yeah, I'm singing at the same time as I'm going, oh yeah, I like that horse of galaxy.
[time=2787] There it is.
[time=2788] Okay, now we're shooting through this one.
[time=2789] I'm totally into that while I'm singing, while I'm worshipping.
[time=2793] And then this other song comes out, oh, Corbin, I like that song, good job.
[time=2796] Thank you for singing that one.
[time=2797] You know, this one I could do without, you know, but okay, this was quick.
[time=2800] He didn't kind of hang on it forever, like sometimes he does, and he can move on.
[time=2804] Okay, Kelly comes up.
[time=2806] Kelly speaks, oh, I love Kelly's how he communicates.
[time=2808] You know, he can make some of the most boring announcements, the most interesting thing.
[time=2811] I'm ready to come to Christ and come to the altar call on some children's, you know, thing.
[time=2815] And so, you know, I love listening to Kelly.
[time=2817] And he just tells stories.
[time=2818] He just got some of the most interesting stories I've ever heard.
[time=2821] And then when he gets to teaching and reading scripture, I kind of pull out my palm pilot and look like I'm working, but it's a game.
[time=2827] And then, you know, then when he tells the story, I'm back engaged in it.
[time=2831] And so it's good, or if Mitch, and he has got incredible stories, or Steve, just his wisdom that he shared.
[time=2836] I mean, so, you know, I consume this, I consume that, and I leave.
[time=2840] And what's the conversation in your car, in my car, on the way out?
[time=2844] What do you think of church?
[time=2846] Well, I like the worship.
[time=2847] It was really good.
[time=2848] I love this song.
[time=2849] I always love it when we sing that.
[time=2850] He does a good job with that.
[time=2851] Oh, this, I like this story that Kelly said.
[time=2853] Yeah, I love that scripture.
[time=2854] I never seen that before.
[time=2854] That was really good.
[time=2855] I'll have to think about that one sometime.
[time=2857] And what am I doing?
[time=2859] I'm consuming.
[time=2860] I am the consumer.
[time=2863] Do you realize that when we worship in song, and when our praise goes forth, and there's audible noise here, that that song rises to heaven, and guess who consumes it?
[time=2876] God.
[time=2878] God consumes our worship.
[time=2881] So why am I sitting in that pew right there, consuming it?
[time=2884] 'Cause I'm a consumer.
[time=2887] I'm sure that when Corbin, you know, sang up here,
[time=2894] he was not saying, "May the minute words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to you, O Dave." Kelly didn't organize his message for me.
[time=2902] You know, these people doing the children's ministries and student ministries, they're not doing this thing so that I would be pleased with them.
[time=2909] They're doing this so that he may be pleased with them.
[time=2912] So then why am I consuming it?
[time=2914] Why am I trying to be God?
[time=2918] Why shouldn't I be who I am, man, worshiping God?
[time=2922] You're either consuming, or you're producing.
[time=2925] You're either consuming ministry around this place, or you're producing ministry around this place.
[time=2929] You're either consuming the worship in this place, or you're producing the worship in this place.
[time=2932] And when we become a church fully that's producing worship and sang it up, the glory of God is gonna be amazing for us to experience.
[time=2942] The heavens declare the glory of God.
[time=2945] I do not want to consume it.
[time=2947] I want to produce it.
[time=2948] Judy studies in the nursery.
[time=2952] She's been holding babies for, you know, I think she said 16, 17 years.
[time=2957] There's Deb Howard's been in there for over 10 years, or someone else has been in there for over 20 years, holding our babies.
[time=2965] You know what their purpose is?
[time=2966] It's not to hold your babies.
[time=2967] I'm sorry, I hope that doesn't unsettle you.
[time=2969] If there's a bunch of mothers who need to run out there, you go ahead and do that.
[time=2972] But their purpose of being in that nursery is to glorify God.
[time=2975] And you know how they do that?
[time=2978] By doing what God has called them to do for the glory of God.
[time=2981] And it's awesome when that happens.
[time=2984] So Judy Studie, or Barbara Bolschman, who kind of runs the children's ministry, she's not doing that for our kids.
[time=2992] She's doing that to glorify God so that when she, at the end of the day, she can say, "May the words of my mouth "and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, "O Lord, my rock and my redeemer." And if she serves us in the process, great.
[time=3004] But she's doing this for God.
[time=3006] She was on the mission's trip with the student ministries this year, not to take care of our high school students, but to worship and glorify God.
[time=3014] And you know what, she served our kids doing that.
[time=3016] What about you?
[time=3017] What are you doing that's glorifying God?
[time=3021] When you walk in this place and you sing, are you worshiping and glorifying God?
[time=3026] Are you, do you have the mindset, may the words of my mouth, even though I'm singing, Lord, maybe they'd be pleasing to you, may when they rise to heaven, may you be able to consume them because they're pleasing to you.
[time=3039] I don't care if I like the song or not.
[time=3040] This is for you, not me.
[time=3043] I was in band in high school 'cause I had to.
[time=3046] I hated every single song we played 'cause I hated band.
[time=3050] But you know what, when I played, I realized I'm not playing for me.
[time=3054] I'm playing for an audience.
[time=3055] That's not me.
[time=3056] So I played to the best of my ability.
[time=3059] When we come in here, we may not like everything we hear.
[time=3061] We may not like every song we sing.
[time=3062] But you know what, it's not for you.
[time=3064] It's not for me, it's for God.
[time=3066] It's for us to participate in worship God.
[time=3069] And when we do this together and our mindset is Lord, may our, may my voice, may my songs be pleasing to you.
[time=3076] When we get that corporately, do you realize the amount of worship God is gonna consume?
[time=3082] Do you realize what He will do in this place through us as a body and us individually?
[time=3088] Amazing.
[time=3090] The community we would feel, the relationships that would be built here, the ministry that would happen, the hurts that would be repaired, the marriages that be rebuilt, the financial struggles that will be repaired would happen when we begin to glorify God.
[time=3103] And in the process of glorifying God, He's gonna show me what I'm called to.
[time=3106] He's gonna help me go here and help this person or do this person.
[time=3109] But I'm not doing that to help that person.
[time=3111] I'm doing that to glorify God.
[time=3113] And part of me glorifying God is maybe my hands helping someone out over here.
[time=3117] Maybe it was something I know over here about finances, helping this couple get through this.
[time=3121] Maybe because of my marriage experience, maybe there's something I can offer over here.
[time=3126] That is glorifying God when we have that mentality.
[time=3129] And church, when we get that and we lose the consumer mindset at state and lame-ier and we walk in here, we're all about God and Lord, may this be pleasing to you.
[time=3138] And as I help with the three-year-olds or as I teach this or I do that, may you be pleased.
[time=3144] So maybe when I leave the parking lot today, I'm not saying, oh, I thought this was good or I thought that was good.
[time=3149] I think I hit a home run here.
[time=3151] That's a joke.
[time=3152] But maybe what I'm saying is Lord, maybe I'm even trembling a bit because the God who created this universe is listening.
[time=3162] So maybe when I leave the parking lot, I'm thinking Lord was what I said pleasing to you.
[time=3168] Is this what you wanted to be said?
[time=3170] Is this what they needed to hear?
[time=3172] Was it pleasing to you?
[time=3174] Is that something you can consume?
[time=3176] You know, the worship, during the worship time when I was singing was I fully engaged?
[time=3183] Was I all about focusing on you and worshiping you because you deserve it?
[time=3187] May the words of my mouth be pleasing to you
[time=3193] in the meditation of my heart.
[time=3195] What I think about, what I value, what I'm passionate about, may these be pleasing to you?
[time=3202] The heavens declare the glory of God.
[time=3207] Well, how else can we see God's glory?
[time=3213] There's one way that's pretty obvious, I think.
[time=3216] When we talk about the glory of God and him revealing himself to us and the coboed of God, the glory that he initiates in revealing himself.
[time=3226] When, remember, it's two responses, the first response is when he looks down on earth and he sees something that's not right when he's not getting the honor, when he's not getting the glory, he comes down and glorifies himself.
[time=3237] And then it's our response.
[time=3238] Well, what about this shot?
[time=3240] Yeah.
[time=3244] God looks down, he's a broken world.
[time=3248] He looks down and sees people who are guilty, who are living in shame, who need to be restored.
[time=3255] He comes down, this is the coboed of God, the glory of God.
[time=3259] Colossians 1, 15, that he is the image of the invisible God.
[time=3264] It was down to verse 19 says, God shows what his fullness dwell with him.
[time=3270] This, the glory of God, the coboed of God.
[time=3276] Something wasn't right, he glorified himself,
[time=3282] he revealed himself, that was his response.
[time=3285] Now, what's ours?
[time=3291] Church, we have a response here.
[time=3294] Obviously accepting this, it's accepting what Christ has done to mend my broken ways, to mend my relationship with this Creator so that my worship can be pleasing to him.
[time=3313] I just feel that as a church, I'm done with my notes here, I feel as a church, I feel like our response, there's a corporate response that we can still make.
[time=3324] There's a corporate response where we can say, okay, as a church, we're gonna be about his glory now.
[time=3330] It's not gonna be about how big we are compared to the church down the street.
[time=3333] It's not gonna be about how we look here, it's not gonna be how our view is, 'cause it's not about us.
[time=3339] Maybe we don't care about Black Hawk's reputation anymore, maybe we care about gods.
[time=3343] And so we're concerned about my life and how I represent him.
[time=3346] Maybe we're concerned about how we are living a community with one another, or that we're living a community with one another.
[time=3353] There's a response here because of this.
[time=3358] This is the image of the invisible God, the heavens declare his glory.
[time=3364] This is God's glory.
[time=3368] This is God at his best.
[time=3371] He is life when he conquers death.
[time=3373] He is perfect and holy, even though he took on sin.
[time=3378] At dark day in human history, this was the best day in eternity, 'cause this is the day that the door opened up for us.
[time=3388] To be pleasing to him.
[time=3392] Maybe we need to think about God a little differently than we did when we came in here.
[time=3399] Yeah, he's big, he's incredible, he's pure.
[time=3403] But he should be at the center.
[time=3406] We should be about God.
[time=3407] I love this place.
[time=3410] I absolutely love this place.
[time=3413] I love working with college students.
[time=3414] I love speaking to you at from time to time.
[time=3417] I love interacting with you.
[time=3419] And I'm looking for people who we can go arm in arm with, who can have the mentality.
[time=3425] Lord, may the words of my mouth, may the meditation of my heart, the work of my hands, may they be pleasing to you.
[time=3434] And if there's a community in this place that does that, watch out.
[time=3441] God will show up in incredible ways.
[time=3444] And I'm for one, I wanna see that.
[time=3447] I wanna be part of a body that wants God to show up.
[time=3451] That's all about his renown, his image, and who he is.
[time=3455] Let's pray.
[time=3457] Father, thank you for being merciful to us.
[time=3463] Thank you for being gracious to us and patient.
[time=3467] Sometimes, Lord, we just don't get it.
[time=3470] We just don't see you when we should be seeing you.
[time=3473] Jesus, I thank you for being the exact representation, the image of the invisible God, for showing us not only how to live, it's showing us the kingdom.
[time=3484] May we respond in a way that's appropriate.
[time=3489] I pray that maybe we need to get in community with others and kind of walk this journey, not alone anymore.
[time=3496] Maybe there's some relationship issues that we just need to deal with, 'cause that would be honoring to you, that would be pleasing to you.
[time=3501] Lord, may we be a church, may Fort Wayne be a city, that's about pleasing you, that's about your honor,
[time=3512] that's about worshiping you.
[time=3514] And Jesus, we ask all these things in your name.
[time=3518] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
