[time=30] Hi, my name is Sam Barfell, and I have the privilege of serving as the superintendent
[time=40] of Black Hawk Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=43] Now, Black Hawk Christian School has been in existence for just over 30 years, and I'd like to take this opportunity just to share some of the exciting things about what we get to do as a Christian school.
[time=54] First of all, we use a line around here that goes like this.
[time=57] We believe Black Hawk Christian School provides academic excellence on a biblical foundation, and there are two parts to that.
[time=63] The academic excellence is something that we pursue hard, and we have a rigorous curriculum that we challenge our students to give their very best and be the very best student that God's called them to be.
[time=74] But the other part of that is the biblical foundation.
[time=76] Everything that we teach comes from the truth of Scripture, and the premise of everything we teach comes from that scriptural base, and that is what we call teaching truth.
[time=88] And then the other thing I'd like to tell you about is our faculty.
[time=90] We just have an incredible team of people who make up the teachers and the faculty, the staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=97] And these people have given their professional lives and their ministry lives to serving the students that God has by his sovereignty placed right here in our school, to provide that academic excellence on a biblical foundation.
[time=111] And it is my pleasure to work next and alongside those who are the faculty and staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=117] They are second to none, I'm convinced of that.
[time=120] And I would like to just encourage you and challenge you during these summer months, as you're thinking about next fall, school starting up again, to think about and explore the possibility
[time=129] of your child, your students becoming part of the family here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=135] And I would challenge you to give us a call and let us give you what we call a tour and a talk, walk through our facilities so you can catch kind of a heart glimpse of what we're about and what we're trying to accomplish and how we're trying to partner with parents who want their children to walk in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ.
[time=152] And how that and education are just seamlessly welded together in such a powerful way.
[time=158] And so I invite you to give us a call, get on our website and contact us and let us give
[time=165] you some more information about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=168] Thanks so much.
[time=169] We look forward to hearing from you.
[time=175] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=184] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all of us, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[time=202] and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=207] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and blow I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=218] Teaching seekers, fine, and follow Christ.
[time=231] Psalm 34 says, "I will bless the Lord forever, His praise shall be continually on my lips."
[time=241] Let's take this time this morning to praise and bless our God with our lips and our mouths
[time=247] and our hearts.
[time=249] My feet are planted on this rock, and I will not be shaken.
[time=257] My hope it comes from you alone, my Lord and my salvation.
[time=265] Your praise is always on my lips, your word is lifted in my heart, and I will praise
[time=275] you in a new song, my soul will bless you, Lord, you fill my life with greater joy.
[time=285] I will praise you in a new song, my soul will bless you, Lord, when I am weak, you make
[time=295] me strong.
[time=296] When I'm poor, I know I'm rich, born in the power of your day.
[time=304] All things are passable, all things are passable, all things are passable, all things are passable.
[time=318] Your praise is always on my lips, your word is lifted in my heart, and I will praise you
[time=329] in a new song, my soul will bless you, Lord, you fill my life with greater joy.
[time=338] I will praise you in a new song, my soul will bless you, Lord, when I am weak, you make
[time=350] me strong.
[time=351] When I'm poor, I know I'm rich, born in the power of your day.
[time=360] All things are passable, all things are passable, all things are passable, all things are passable.
[time=376] Everything is possible with the God who saves, and we want to praise God this morning for
[time=382] being our Redeemer, for being our deliverer, for the one that lifts us from the fiery play of sin and selfishness, and we just want to proclaim his reign and his rule in this place.
[time=399] Sing this together, my Savior, Redeemer, lifted me from the fiery play, all nighting forever.
[time=414] I will never be the same as you came here, from the everlasting to the world we live,
[time=426] Father's only Son, if you live, if you die, if you rose again on high, if you opened the
[time=440] way for the world to live again, hallelujah, for all you turn.
[time=457] On Savior, Redeemer, lifted me from the fiery play, all nighting forever.
[time=468] I will never be the same as you came here, from the everlasting to the world we live,
[time=479] Father's only Son, if you live, if you die, if you rose again on high, if you opened the
[time=494] way for the world to live again, hallelujah, for all you turn, you lift and die, if you
[time=509] die, if you rose again on high, if you opened the way for the world to live again, hallelujah.
[time=521] For all you turn, sing hallelujah, hallelujah, for all you turn.
[time=534] Hallelujah, hallelujah, for all you turn.
[time=543] And so remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise, oh God.
[time=581] enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=587] Come my children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord, whoever of you loves
[time=611] life and desires to see many good days, keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking lies, turn from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it.
[time=622] The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and His ears are attentive to their cry.
[time=627] The face of the Lord is against those who do evil to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
[time=632] The righteous cry out and the Lord hears them, he delivers them from all of their troubles.
[time=638] The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirits.
[time=643] A righteous man may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all.
[time=648] He protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken.
[time=654] This verse has come from Psalm 34, Psalm that proclaims great promises of our God.
[time=661] And I just want to praise God for the promises that He has.
[time=664] His promises has given us and the promise that He will be faithful and true to His word.
[time=671] So let's sing together, God, remember your promises, remember your people, remember us, your children, because His grace is enough.
[time=682] So remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise, oh God.
[time=698] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=745] And He lives, and He died, and He rose again on high, and He opened the way, for the world
[time=757] to live again, hallelujah, for all you turn, hallelujah, for all you turn, hallelujah,
[time=773] for all you turn, hallelujah, for all you turn.
[time=785] [AMEN] Hi, I'm Mitch, and oh, Pastor Kelly Bird, if you're watching, it's time to take your
[time=792] donut and get off your treadmill and go get something to drink because I got something
[time=798] to tell everybody that you cannot hear.
[time=801] So go, all right, Sunday, July 30th, that's this coming Sunday.
[time=809] We are honoring Kelly and Deborah for 10 years of service here at Black Hawk Ministries,
[time=815] 10 years of ministry.
[time=817] And so we're going to honor both of them in the first service, 9 a.m., and also at 10.45 a.m., and then here's what we're going to do, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[time=825] Immediately following our second service at about noon, we're going to have a cookout, an old-fashioned cookout, hot dog, sloppy joes, chips, all kinds of food, and all kinds of fun.
[time=836] You can bring your kids, they'll be games for the kids, they'll be the blow-up slides and things to jump on, and we'll be done by two.
[time=845] And I'm told there's also going to be a pastor's dunking tank with proceeds going to the vine,
[time=851] our ministry here to help those in need.
[time=854] But I'm swearing not to be one of the people who becomes dunked.
[time=858] So we'll just see what happens, I'm going to get Pastor Bird in there, and we'll get him dunked a whole bunch of times.
[time=863] So please join us for this celebration of Kelly and Deborah's ministry here at Black
[time=869] Hawk for the last 10 years, fun cookout, bring the kids, and be sure to attend one of the services so you can also join us in thanking him and celebrating Kelly and Deborah's ministry.
[time=880] Thank you so much, and we look forward to seeing you then.
[time=882] Well, good morning, let me just, let me first just reiterate something to you that I was
[time=891] reminded of this morning, first hour, and then just a few minutes ago just sitting here looking at my Bible again.
[time=897] Maybe I don't say this often enough, should probably say it to you all the time, but I
[time=904] just want to say this to you this morning on my Bible on the cover.
[time=908] My wife and my kids had engraved first Peter 411.
[time=914] First Peter 411 says, "Whoever speaks, let him speak as if it were the very utterances
[time=925] of God." And I just want to again just commit to each and every one of you that each time I stand
[time=934] in front of you, each and every time any of us stand in front of you, we desire to do that and only that to explain to you, to state for you, to try our best to teach to
[time=944] you the very Word of God, nothing more, nothing less.
[time=949] And our belief is that when you receive that Word, our belief and our deep conviction is
[time=955] that the Scriptures teach that when you receive that Word, that Word is a powerful Word.
[time=961] There's a Word that can do what no man can, it can transform you, it can change you, it can convict you, it can shape you into the person that God has called you to be.
[time=971] And so that's our desire to do that week in and week out.
[time=974] And so just know that that's our intent and that that's our heart.
[time=980] I want to say thank you to Dave Walters, who was here last week, what a lineup of guys
[time=986] God has given us.
[time=987] What a great crew.
[time=988] You've got a Psalm study guide, I got one in your hand this morning, if you don't, they'll be available for you on the way out.
[time=994] Summer in the Psalms, a study has been prepared for you.
[time=998] Each of the messages that are coming have been somewhat outlined and you have a chance throughout the week to continue on in the dialogue and the discussion of that morning.
[time=1008] And so I hope you've picked one of those up inside that study guide.
[time=1011] You can see the messages, the different Psalms that have been chosen and the guys that will be speaking this summer, and I am so thankful for what Dave did last week and so thankful
[time=1021] to be here with you this morning and to be able to invite you to turn to Psalm 34.
[time=1026] Would you do that?
[time=1027] Would you open your Bibles to Psalm 34?
[time=1030] And let me just ask you this as you're turning, why did you come to church?
[time=1034] Why did you come to this gathering this morning?
[time=1039] Why do you do that?
[time=1043] Why did you set the alarm last night?
[time=1046] Why did you this morning get up and do your very best to be here by 1035-1050, we'll say?
[time=1055] You know what I mean?
[time=1056] Or maybe you came earlier this morning, why?
[time=1059] Haven't asked you that in a while, I'm asking.
[time=1063] And I want so desperately for there to be an answer in your heart before God.
[time=1068] And I would want there to be a response in you, why are you here?
[time=1076] You could be so many other places, you could be doing so many other things.
[time=1081] Why are you here?
[time=1082] Why do you walk through those doors and sit in these seats and give yourself to these
[time=1088] 70 minutes or so?
[time=1093] And I hope this morning, as you and I together make our way through the beginnings of this
[time=1099] passage, I really hope that there are some answers that you discover and see that would be consistent with what I hope is on your heart this morning as I ask the question.
[time=1108] If you're not sure why you're here, first of all let me say I'm glad you're here.
[time=1112] But I want there to be a, I want there to be a sense in you that these times have real purpose and that there is something significant for you and I as the body of Christ gathers
[time=1124] together.
[time=1125] And I hope you can along with me as we go through this, begin to see more and more of this.
[time=1130] As we come to the great Psalm here, Psalm 34, a psalm of David, I just want to remind
[time=1136] you of who our target audience is this morning.
[time=1138] Oftentimes as you read a passage you think, I wonder who that's for, I wonder who that I'll connect with, of all of those of you here this morning or those of you listening on the internet, those of you watching the broadcast, which of you will find this teaching most pertinent or timely or applicable?
[time=1156] Who's going to get the most out of Psalm 34?
[time=1159] I'll tell you what, you will get a great deal out of Psalm 34.
[time=1165] I believe it will seem and feel pertinent.
[time=1167] I think there will be great application for you.
[time=1171] If you're here this morning and you've ever been afraid, if you've ever experienced fear,
[time=1179] if you've ever encountered heartache, if you've ever been crushed in spirit, anyone in the
[time=1189] room or anybody listening who has ever tasted loss or the confusion of what God has allowed,
[time=1195] anyone who has ever faced trial and the tribulation and the stretching process of life, if you
[time=1203] have ever encountered difficulty, even a level of difficulty that you never thought you could
[time=1209] ever face or endure or persevere through if there's anybody in the room who's ever gone through anything like that.
[time=1216] Raise your hand.
[time=1219] I would suggest to you thank you.
[time=1221] I would suggest to you this morning that Psalm 34 is for each and every one of us.
[time=1226] There may be some in the room this morning.
[time=1228] There might be many in the room this morning who are experiencing that very season of life right now.
[time=1234] The winds for you, the winds might be blowing today really, really hard.
[time=1238] The sky may have gotten really, really dark.
[time=1240] It may be raining really, really hard.
[time=1243] For others of you in the room, you know what, the sky might be really clear.
[time=1248] The sun might be blue, the sun might be shining, the winds are calm.
[time=1253] But see if that's you, you know like I know that the clouds will come one.
[time=1259] Clouds will come back.
[time=1261] The wind will again blow hard and the rain is going to fall.
[time=1269] And so whether you're in the midst of it or whether you're in between it, Psalm 34 gives you and I a great, great picture of the posture of our hearts, the posture of our souls.
[time=1283] Psalm 34 teaches us, especially in these first 10 verses, that there is an attitude of the heart, there is an attitude and a posture of the soul that we as God followers, all of
[time=1294] us should maintain at all times.
[time=1299] And I am so looking forward to you seeing some of you for the first time, others of you will be reminded as we make our way through these verses of the great truth of Psalm 34.
[time=1309] But I can't wait for you to see it again this morning, would you, in honor of God's word, would you stand?
[time=1315] And would you allow me to read it to you?
[time=1318] Psalm 34 verses 1 to 10, it's a psalm of David and David writes, "I will bless the Lord
[time=1325] at all times.
[time=1327] His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
[time=1331] My soul will make its boast in the Lord.
[time=1334] The humble will hear it and rejoice.
[time=1336] Oh, magnify the Lord with me.
[time=1339] And let us exalt His name together.
[time=1343] I sought the Lord and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears.
[time=1347] They looked to Him and were radiant and their faces will never be ashamed.
[time=1352] This poor man cried and the Lord heard Him and saved Him out of all His troubles.
[time=1358] The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him and rescues them.
[time=1363] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[time=1368] How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him.
[time=1373] Oh, fear the Lord." See that phrase there at the beginning of verse 9, "Oh, fear the Lord.
[time=1381] Have a deep sense of respect for Him." That's what that says.
[time=1387] Be in utter awe of who He is and what He's done.
[time=1394] Fear Him, respect Him, hold Him high and lift it up in your heart and soul.
[time=1399] Oh, fear the Lord, you His saints.
[time=1402] For those who do that, for those who fear Him, there is no want.
[time=1408] The young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they who seek the Lord shall not be in
[time=1416] want of any good thing.
[time=1420] Father God, we stand before You this morning, a humble, grateful, needy family.
[time=1434] There is so much in us, God, even now, as we stand here before You, that isn't as it should be.
[time=1441] There are perspectives, God, and attitudes that need to be adjusted, God, there is sin
[time=1447] that needs to be confessed.
[time=1450] There are lessons, God, that need to be learned.
[time=1452] There's growth that needs to take place.
[time=1454] And while we are so grateful for what You have done and are doing in our lives, God standing before You this morning, we realize how in need we are of this great truth.
[time=1465] And so God, take it please and do with it what only You can do.
[time=1471] We stand here committing ourselves to listen, to open ourselves, to soften our hearts, and
[time=1479] may Your Spirit assist in that process.
[time=1482] May we truly, each of us, be open and receptive at a level, God, that would make a difference
[time=1489] in the way we would live our lives today, this afternoon, tonight, tomorrow, and as the
[time=1495] week progresses, grow us and change us, please, we pray in Your Son's name, amen.
[time=1501] You can be seated.
[time=1505] You know, you don't get too far here in Psalm 34, you go right out of the gate into verse 1, and if you're, you know, if you're head in your heart or like in this at all, it's difficult to get past the first phrase.
[time=1518] I will bless the Lord at all times.
[time=1534] Now what is that, my friends, blessing the Lord at all times?
[time=1539] I would admit to you, out of the gate here, it sounds a little cliche.
[time=1544] It might even sound to some a little churchy, maybe it sounds a little kind of high and pious and up there, blessing the Lord at all times.
[time=1554] But I just, I would just beg you to try and get past that.
[time=1560] And I would invite you this morning to look at that screen, or to look in your text there,
[time=1566] and to look at those words.
[time=1568] And I would invite you this morning to give some thought to that truth right there.
[time=1574] I will, David says, bless the Lord at all times.
[time=1585] At all times blessing the Lord.
[time=1592] A few things I want you to take note of this morning, here at the outset, I'd like you just to focus on this phrase that he uses there at the beginning.
[time=1601] You might even want to just write it down, it says I will.
[time=1606] That's right.
[time=1607] I will.
[time=1608] First thing I want you to see is the no matter what mindset and posture of David.
[time=1614] You see it there in those first three verses.
[time=1617] And I want you to sense it, and I want you to hear it as you read through here one more time, sense that, listen for that, that determination that we can begin to hear coming out of our
[time=1631] friend David.
[time=1632] I will bless the Lord at all times.
[time=1636] His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
[time=1640] My soul will make its boast in the Lord.
[time=1644] The humble will hear it and rejoice, oh magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name
[time=1651] together.
[time=1654] You may not, they may not, but let me tell you, by God's grace and with His strength I will.
[time=1662] He says I will at all times.
[time=1664] I will bless the Lord.
[time=1671] You got to read it that way.
[time=1673] You got to let it sink in that way.
[time=1675] It's not, it's not, I will, it's not, I will, all right, I will, it's not it.
[time=1693] It's I will, I will, it's by God's grace, I will.
[time=1701] There is a determination there.
[time=1704] There's perspective there.
[time=1705] There's some, there's some strength there.
[time=1709] And you and I know David and you and I know the, the, you know, by and large we understand some of the concepts of this book.
[time=1714] None of this is in and of oneself.
[time=1717] There is a, a great deal of commitment and devotion in that I will, but it is a, it is a trusting I will as well.
[time=1725] Nonetheless there is a, there is a determined spirit here.
[time=1731] It reminds me of our, it reminds me of our fifth child, affectionately known as Evie.
[time=1740] Evie Joe and, and this is a, you know, there's things about all kids that are unique and those of you who have kids, whether you have two or three or one or five or six or seven, you know, I think as you progress down the, the chain of kids, you start to see some things and those who came later that's a little different sometimes than those who came early on.
[time=1764] And with our fifth one with Evie, it's just incredible to see in her this dogged sense
[time=1770] of determination.
[time=1771] She is not going to be left behind.
[time=1778] You are going to include her in your plans and she will not, she will not fall back.
[time=1785] There is a determination in her and I'm not bragging about her, please understand there is a downside list that we could get into later if you'd like.
[time=1793] But with the determination, I've just seen some amazing things.
[time=1796] I've seen her, I've seen her jump on a pond and swim at three years of age.
[time=1801] She's not going to, she wasn't going to stand there on the dock and watch.
[time=1805] She wanted to get the life jacket off.
[time=1807] She tied her shoe, you know, I'm not talking Velcro.
[time=1809] I mean, tie, tied her shoe at three, three and a half.
[time=1812] She's riding a bike.
[time=1813] She wanted to go in the garage and get the training wheels attached back on.
[time=1817] She scoffed at me.
[time=1818] She didn't want the training wheels.
[time=1820] She wanted to ride her bike.
[time=1823] I will.
[time=1828] It's not I might.
[time=1833] It's I will.
[time=1834] It's not I hope.
[time=1835] I can.
[time=1836] It's I will.
[time=1837] It's not I'm, it's not.
[time=1838] I'm not sure if I will.
[time=1839] It's I will.
[time=1840] I will bless the Lord at all times.
[time=1843] And if you follow the text, which I'm inviting you to do this morning, you see that David's dogged determination and passion about blessing the Lord isn't something he wants to come
[time=1854] and go.
[time=1855] He says, I will bless the Lord at all times.
[time=1859] You see it there and continually.
[time=1862] I will bless the Lord at all times.
[time=1864] His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
[time=1867] My soul will make its boast in the Lord.
[time=1871] The humble will hear it and rejoice.
[time=1876] All times, times there in the text could mean good times and bad times.
[time=1882] It could mean morning, noon, and night.
[time=1884] I will bless the Lord at all times continually with my mouth and from my soul, from my soul.
[time=1893] You might want to write that down internally.
[time=1896] I will.
[time=1897] I will bless the Lord internally with my attitude and with my mind and with my spirit and externally
[time=1904] with my mouth.
[time=1905] You see it right there, the end of verse one.
[time=1909] Externally with the words that I speak and sing, I will at all times with my mouth and
[time=1916] from my soul.
[time=1917] And now I don't want you to miss this.
[time=1920] I want you to see the things right here in our passage this morning that he says he will do.
[time=1927] So internally and externally and I'm going to just take you right back to the very beginning of the text.
[time=1932] I will look what he says and you might want to just jot these down.
[time=1934] I will bless the Lord.
[time=1937] Well, what does that mean here?
[time=1940] Just jot this down.
[time=1942] To bless the Lord, to be a blessing, to bless the Lord means to offer to him kindness and
[time=1949] sacrifice.
[time=1950] It is an offering of kindness and sacrifice toward him.
[time=1953] It is to speak well of him.
[time=1955] I will bless the Lord.
[time=1958] He says I will praise second part of verse one.
[time=1962] His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
[time=1964] I will praise the Lord.
[time=1965] This word praises to, it means to actively verbally proclaim his absolute greatness.
[time=1972] And let me just say this to you, it is an active word.
[time=1977] The praise here that David refers to is an active outward, verbal proclamation of his
[time=1986] absolute utter greatness.
[time=1988] I will praise the Lord.
[time=1991] And it's on my mouth, you'll hear it.
[time=1993] I will.
[time=1996] Go on to verse two, my soul will make its boast.
[time=2000] You see that?
[time=2001] My soul will make its boast in the Lord.
[time=2003] The word there literally means to, the word literally means to brag.
[time=2009] In my soul I will brag, I will boast about the Lord.
[time=2014] And that word, boast, I mean there's no getting around it.
[time=2017] It might sound a little silly to you.
[time=2020] It may even sound childish, but it truly means, this idea of boasting means that mine, mine
[time=2028] is better than yours.
[time=2031] Mine's stronger, mine wins, mine's the best.
[time=2037] And there is an appropriate sense, David seems to indicate here a pride of boasting and how great and how good and how awesome and mighty your God is, the God of the Bible.
[time=2049] He says, I will, I will at all times, with my mouth and from my soul internally and externally.
[time=2056] Press the Lord off for kindness, praise the Lord, actively, verbally proclaim His utter greatness, boast about the Lord or brag about Him.
[time=2066] And then look at what it says there in verse three, oh, magnify the Lord with me.
[time=2074] Magnify, Corbin talked about this recently.
[time=2078] What a great picture this is, I hope you catch this.
[time=2082] The way Corbin said it a few weeks ago is when you take a magnifying glass and you hold it over the object that you're interested in, it makes that object what, smaller or bigger?
[time=2094] It makes it what?
[time=2095] Say it.
[time=2096] Bigger.
[time=2097] It enlarges the object of focus, while everything around that object in the magnifying glass
[time=2103] gets fuzzy.
[time=2105] Everything around it's diminished, the object of focus with the magnification process is
[time=2111] enlarged.
[time=2112] He says, come with me and let us together enlarge His reputation.
[time=2119] I will, He says, I will, I will bless the Lord, I will praise Him, I will boast of Him
[time=2125] and I will and I hope you'll join me, I will magnify the Lord, I will enlarge His reputation.
[time=2132] I will make much of Him.
[time=2137] How do you do that, just a side note for you?
[time=2142] We can go both sides of that.
[time=2143] We could talk about how to magnify Him, we could talk about things that disciplines and
[time=2150] opportunities you and I could give ourselves to, that would, that He uses to help in the magnification process.
[time=2156] That's a good discussion to have.
[time=2158] Part of magnifying Him, part of magnifying Him is not giving ourselves to things that diminish Him.
[time=2166] Does that make sense?
[time=2168] Part of the magnification process, part of making much of God is conducting yourself, you and I living in such a way that doesn't diminish.
[time=2178] We don't want to shrink His reputation, we want to enlarge it.
[time=2182] We want to further it.
[time=2184] I will, He says, bless the Lord, praise the Lord, boast about the Lord, magnify the Lord.
[time=2192] And look how verse 3 ends and let us exalt His name together.
[time=2197] My friends, this last phrase here speaks to the activity of the congregation.
[time=2204] I think you have a list there on the screen.
[time=2206] Just kind of show you a list of those five things right there, look at that.
[time=2212] The passage progresses from personal, very personal, private, intimate blessing.
[time=2219] Which progresses from the blessing of the Lord personally to the activity of the congregation
[time=2227] in exalting His name together.
[time=2229] This speaks to the people in the gathering.
[time=2232] Exalting my friends is what takes place when the instruments play, when the singing begins, when the hands are clapping, when there's dancing and shouting, all the things that the Psalms speak to as the Psalms describe God honoring worship.
[time=2248] During the clapping, the dancing, the shouting, the speaking, the lifting up of voices and joyful noises with gratitude and praise and affirmation of who He is and what He's done.
[time=2261] David says, I will.
[time=2263] You may not.
[time=2265] They may not.
[time=2267] I will.
[time=2268] I love what Spurgeon Charles had in Spurgeon said about passionate worship.
[time=2276] He said, and I quote in heaven, "It is enjoyed to the full and earth is likeest heaven wherever
[time=2283] it abounds." It meaning exalting the name of the Lord together.
[time=2294] So there you have it.
[time=2295] What an amazing, what an amazing beginning to this great Psalm.
[time=2302] David says, I will.
[time=2305] Now here's my question for you.
[time=2311] Back to why are you here?
[time=2314] Back to why did you get up and why are you sitting here and why are you taking this time to engage in this process?
[time=2320] Why am I here?
[time=2324] And here's my concern.
[time=2325] It's always been my concern.
[time=2327] It is my concern today.
[time=2328] It'll always be my concern down the road.
[time=2330] It's something we have to continually give thought to because here's the deal.
[time=2334] If you are here to kill 70 minutes, if you're here to just and what I mean by killing 70
[time=2340] minutes is if you're here just to listen, if you come in the doors and you sit in these
[time=2346] seats and all we do is sing some songs and somebody gets up and speaks and hopefully it's decent and it keeps you awake and it captures your attention at some point in the 70 minutes and you leave going, wow, that was pretty decent.
[time=2360] You go have lunch and then you go mow the lawn and then you reengage in this next Sunday
[time=2368] at 1045, then boy, we've missed it.
[time=2375] Boy, we've really, really missed it.
[time=2380] And as I'm looking through this week, I'm realizing, you know what, in my heart, I kind of have an idea of what this needs to be about.
[time=2387] This needs to be about the body of Christ gathering.
[time=2390] They gather and they come and they open their hearts and minds and they might open a notebook, they might not, but they engage, you do.
[time=2398] You engage in what's being said and taught and hopefully it's being taught in a way that's clear and makes sense and hopefully God has anointed that process and as you receive that
[time=2408] truth, you take that truth in.
[time=2410] You might write a few things down about that truth but then here's the deal.
[time=2414] Then you leave and then you engage with that truth tonight and tomorrow and Tuesday and
[time=2421] Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and Saturday, what we teach and what you take in and the
[time=2428] dialogue that we have as we work our way through the Scriptures, it never leaves you.
[time=2435] And you get up, and then you set the alarm Saturday night or you get up Sunday morning and now back to the question, why are you here?
[time=2442] You're back to get more.
[time=2445] You're back to be fed.
[time=2447] You're back because you need food and you need the body and you need the fellowship and the chance to look eye to eye and face to face and say, "Woo, I'm glad you're still in.
[time=2458] I needed to see you.
[time=2460] I needed to worship God with you." But as I'm thinking about this, I'm thinking, "Gosh, I've got to try my best to give you something, to take with you this week, that in a very practical, applicable way could
[time=2473] make a difference in the way that you choose and live and function." So here you go.
[time=2479] We got through three verses and I'm going to just stop right here and I'm going to invite you this week and you can write this down.
[time=2486] I hope you will.
[time=2487] I'm going to invite you to in the next six days, give yourself, each and every one of you, students, young adults, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, care who you are,
[time=2498] where you're from, how old you are, how young you are.
[time=2500] I'm going to give you a chance to take these five things that you see on the screen and make personal application through the week.
[time=2508] This week, I'm asking you to do this.
[time=2512] I'm asking you this week, to each day, do the first four things on that list, at least
[time=2520] okay, first hour I said once.
[time=2526] So don't complain, okay, it's the spirit of God moving in me, I promise.
[time=2532] But I'm going to say five times, listen, I am going to ask you and I'm hoping that you're
[time=2538] going to take me up on this.
[time=2540] I'm going to engage in it with you.
[time=2542] I am asking you for the next six days, to each day, five times a day, and you're going to
[time=2550] have to write this down because this is going to be something that I think could radically affect the way you and I experience our week.
[time=2556] Do those four things.
[time=2558] Watch this.
[time=2559] Number one, write this down, bless the Lord.
[time=2561] I am asking you each day, this next week, to bless the Lord, write it down, five times.
[time=2569] Here's what I mean by, now I'm going to help you.
[time=2572] I'm going to tell you exactly how you can do this and you can deviate from it, you can add to it.
[time=2577] I just want you to get the gist.
[time=2579] You can bless the Lord.
[time=2580] David said, I will, I want you to, I want to.
[time=2583] So let's bless the Lord this week.
[time=2586] Here you go.
[time=2587] I love you, Lord.
[time=2594] Could you say that?
[time=2596] Yes or no?
[time=2597] It's a question.
[time=2598] Can you say that?
[time=2599] Say it.
[time=2601] Could you whisper that in the car?
[time=2602] Yes or no?
[time=2604] Could you say it in the shower?
[time=2606] Could you, as you begin your day, could you at lunch?
[time=2609] Could you at dinner?
[time=2610] Could you laying there in bed at night before your eyes close?
[time=2614] Could you say, I love you, Lord.
[time=2615] Could you say this?
[time=2616] I offer you all of me today.
[time=2618] Write that down.
[time=2619] I offer you all of me today.
[time=2623] God I love you and I offer you all of me today out at night with my friends at home, at work,
[time=2630] and online.
[time=2632] I offer you, I give to you all of me.
[time=2636] I want to be a blessing.
[time=2638] I want to, I will bless the Lord at all times.
[time=2641] Could you say that to him?
[time=2642] Could you pray that in the early morning hours?
[time=2644] Could you think that on your way to class?
[time=2646] Could you, could you run that through your mind and offer that to him while you work out?
[time=2653] Here you go.
[time=2654] I deeply desire to represent you and what is true and right.
[time=2658] That's it.
[time=2659] Write that down.
[time=2660] I deeply desire to represent you and what's true and right.
[time=2664] Could you offer that to him as a prayer?
[time=2668] Could you offer that to him as a statement of commitment?
[time=2673] Could you do that a few times a day?
[time=2677] Could you?
[time=2679] If you would, that's a blessing to him.
[time=2685] Here you go.
[time=2686] Go to the second one.
[time=2687] Praise the Lord.
[time=2689] Don't you think you could do this a couple, two, three, four, five times a day?
[time=2694] Don't you think it's within you if you're mindful about it?
[time=2697] You get some accountability.
[time=2699] If we did this together, couldn't you, students, young adults, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, couldn't you say to God at some point during the day, "God, you are truly amazing."
[time=2712] Could you say that?
[time=2713] Yes or no?
[time=2714] Sure you could.
[time=2715] Could you think that?
[time=2722] Could you feel that?
[time=2724] You are above and beyond.
[time=2726] You are over the top.
[time=2729] You are so good.
[time=2730] You are so faithful.
[time=2732] You are so gracious.
[time=2733] Could you, with intentionality in your spirit, could you say these things to him?
[time=2739] Could you praise him privately?
[time=2742] Could you praise him?
[time=2743] Could you speak, what did we say praise was to speak, to actively and verbally articulate
[time=2751] the utter greatness of God?
[time=2753] Could you praise God?
[time=2756] Say things about him that are utterly true about his greatness.
[time=2760] Could you do that at dinner with your kids or with your spouse or with a roommate?
[time=2765] Could you take a few minutes at a meal and do that, yes or no?
[time=2769] You could do it at breakfast, right?
[time=2771] You could do it at lunch, yes?
[time=2773] You could do it at dinner, you could praise him in the car, it could be a little embarrassing,
[time=2780] but who cares?
[time=2781] You will never see him again.
[time=2783] Just sing, just let it out, just talk to him as you drive, express verbally the utter
[time=2792] greatness of this God who is like none other.
[time=2795] You could praise him privately, you could praise him with your kids at a meal, you could praise him in the car, you could praise him in the elevator.
[time=2801] That could get embarrassing as well, but who knows?
[time=2804] You could praise him walking in the mall, you could praise him doing laundry, you could praise him running on a treadmill, you could praise him while you're pulling weeds or spreading mulch, you could praise him, you could tell him verbally with a smile on your face how good and how gracious and how patient he's been.
[time=2822] David said, "I will, I will bless him, I will praise, his praise will continuously be on
[time=2829] my mouth." Now watch this, somebody might be sitting in this room this morning or you may be an
[time=2837] earshot of my voice and you might be sitting there thinking, "Good night, what is the deal
[time=2843] with him?" I mean now all of a sudden he's talking about me doing this stuff all the time.
[time=2848] I mean he's up there talking about privately and with kids at a meal in the car and the elevator walking in the mall, laundry and treadmills and pulling weeds and spreading
[time=2858] mulch, I mean it sounds like he's like trying to get me to be fanatical.
[time=2863] Well here's the deal.
[time=2868] There's another player in this contest and I'll just ask it to you this way.
[time=2879] Have you ever experienced the enemy trying to get in your head on the treadmill?
[time=2888] Have you ever experienced the enemy trying to get in your head while you were doing laundry?
[time=2892] Have you ever experienced the enemy trying to get in your head and offer his temptation and move you in a different direction while you're there at the table with the kids and the milks getting spilled and everybody's yelling and you're tense with your spouse?
[time=2907] See there's the deal folks.
[time=2908] The enemy is going to come at you 24/7, wherever you are, whatever you're engaged in trying
[time=2916] to pull you away from a heart of praise.
[time=2921] David says match that and whatever you do, wherever you are, praise him.
[time=2929] And that might sound fanatical to you, it might sound kind of out there.
[time=2934] I would just call it smart.
[time=2937] I would call it wise.
[time=2941] This week I'm inviting you to praise him verbally, outwardly, in a number of different
[time=2947] settings, maybe four or five, who knows, six times in a given day.
[time=2953] Engage in some thirdly.
[time=2954] Here you go.
[time=2955] Try this one.
[time=2956] This week, as you and I live our lives this week, I'm asking you to, on a practical level,
[time=2963] make this truth and apply it to your life.
[time=2966] Engage in soulful boasting, couple two, three, four, five times a day throughout the week.
[time=2974] Say to yourself from your soul, say to yourself that if there was an AP/UPI or USA Today, top
[time=2983] 20 deity poll, are God's number one.
[time=2988] He's the best.
[time=2989] He's past number one.
[time=2991] Remember God, the God of the Bible, has held that number one spot forever, literally.
[time=2998] There is none better.
[time=3000] There are none more powerful.
[time=3002] There are no other capital G gods, amen?
[time=3007] Buddha, Confucius, Mohammed, pleasure, money, lust.
[time=3013] None of them have ever overtaken the number one spot.
[time=3017] Your God is better.
[time=3020] And that is awesome, and that is worth celebrating.
[time=3023] And you've got to, David says, from his soul, he will make boast about the Lord.
[time=3028] I'm not telling you to yell this from your office window.
[time=3033] I'm not saying that you should run up and down your street.
[time=3035] I'm not saying you should harp on the guy or the gal in the cubicle next to you.
[time=3039] I'm saying from your soul, remind yourself that the God you serve, do it all week long.
[time=3045] Four, five, six times a day.
[time=3049] For God reigns.
[time=3051] He rules.
[time=3052] He is the greatest, and there is none like him, and it's not even close.
[time=3058] Say it to yourself this week, bless him this week, praise him this week, brag about him.
[time=3065] These four things, magnify, fourth one, magnify.
[time=3070] Write that down.
[time=3072] Help, here's the deal, help this week, this week, two, three, four, five times a day.
[time=3078] Here's the challenge, help his reputation.
[time=3085] Don't hinder his reputation.
[time=3089] Go, go, serve somebody, go help somebody, do the extra chore, write the extra card, send
[time=3098] the extra check, do something this week, two, three, four, five times a day, mindful, intentionally
[time=3107] go and do something with humility to help his reputation, to give him a good name, to
[time=3118] consistently help people see that he really is a God who grows people and transforms people
[time=3125] and makes them new.
[time=3126] Don't hurt him.
[time=3129] Don't go do or say or bees, things that are going to just take his reputation and diminish
[time=3136] it.
[time=3137] No.
[time=3138] Let's magnify him.
[time=3139] David says, oh, magnify the Lord with me.
[time=3142] All right, here you go.
[time=3145] I said four because, again, I hope you see there in the text that our first, when you look at the first four, bless the Lord, praise the Lord, brag about the Lord, magnify the Lord.
[time=3155] These are things that we can do individually and then we can, if you're up for this, if you would really give yourself to it, see, and I will with you this week, we can all come back together again next Sunday at 1040, 1035 to 1050 and we can exalt his name together.
[time=3177] And when you're part of a congregation, my friends, when you're part of a family, that
[time=3183] all we, here's why, here's one of the reasons why I come each and every week.
[time=3189] I hope it's one of the reasons you come.
[time=3191] And you're part of a family that all week long lives and postures themselves like this.
[time=3200] When you're part of a family who comes in through doors and sits in seats and we're all in here together.
[time=3206] And for six days, we have been not perfectly but faithfully giving ourselves to blessing
[time=3212] him and praising him and bragging about him and magnifying him then when you get all those folks in a room and they come together, the exalting and the worship is anointed.
[time=3224] It's alive, it's powerful, it brings great glory to God, it fills your heart and mind
[time=3233] with that sense of strength and encouragement to be fed again, to be given a new challenge
[time=3239] and opportunity and to walk through those doors and go live for God six more days to come back again and to exalt his name.
[time=3248] When you fill up a room with people who are giving God their 70 minutes, when you fill
[time=3254] up a room with people who are giving God just a listening ear and the hope that the guy has something decent to say, you just get a room full of people singing songs.
[time=3266] It's about the extent of it.
[time=3270] And there's not a lot to that.
[time=3274] My hope is that you would take me up on this.
[time=3279] If you need some help, you know, I say this to you almost every week.
[time=3284] Many of you take me up on it.
[time=3285] I'm thankful that you do.
[time=3286] We mean it.
[time=3287] If you need some help, ask.
[time=3290] Those of you in accountability situations, those of you in small groups, those of you with a class of folks that you kind of live and share life with, those of you with good friends, talk about this.
[time=3303] I'm asking you each and every day this week to three, four, five times a day, bless him and praise him and brag about him and magnify him.
[time=3312] You don't have to broadcast your progress.
[time=3314] I'm asking you personally to keep track.
[time=3318] And let me just say this to you.
[time=3320] David said, I will.
[time=3323] Let me show you just a little bit more here.
[time=3326] It's as if he gets to verse four and says, and here's why.
[time=3329] Come back to the text real quick.
[time=3331] I will give myself to these things.
[time=3334] Here's why.
[time=3336] Look at verse four, five, six and seven.
[time=3338] I sought the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears.
[time=3344] Anybody in the room here this morning, can anybody in the room hear this morning say, amen to that?
[time=3351] Can anybody in the room this morning, can any of you at any point in your journey with him have you experienced seeking him and him answering you, delivering you for your fears from your fears?
[time=3365] David said, I will.
[time=3366] And I'll tell you why I will, because I sought him and he answered me and he delivered me from my fears.
[time=3372] They looked to him and were radiant and their faces will never be ashamed.
[time=3376] This poor man, poor meaning afflicted, anybody in this room ever been afflicted and cried
[time=3383] and the Lord heard you and saved you out of your troubles?
[time=3388] And the angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him and rescues them.
[time=3393] He said, I will and here's why.
[time=3396] And as I read through his list of here's why, I am so reminded of God's goodness.
[time=3403] And it draws me, it pulls at me, it invites me to say with him, I will too.
[time=3412] And so I hope that's something for you to take with you today.
[time=3415] And I hope you'll take that with you and I hope you will, I hope we can together.
[time=3421] Live out this truth this week, I'll look forward to hearing how it goes.
[time=3426] My hope and my prayer is that he will grow you and stretch you in the process and I can't
[time=3432] wait to be together again and we'll continue on in the Psalms.
[time=3437] And as it says there on your study guide, I hope you got one, they'll be available for you out there if you'd like one, it says, growing our hearts as we make our way through
[time=3447] the Psalms, that's our prayer, that he would grow your heart and mind.
[time=3451] Stand with me, would you?
[time=3452] Let me pray for us as we go, Father, we thank you for the words of David and his determination
[time=3458] and each of us would admit that there are times when ours fades.
[time=3462] Oh God, with the strength and the courage, with the determination that you and your word
[time=3468] and your spirit can provide, I pray that you would allow us to face this week.
[time=3473] I pray that each and every person in this room would take some step, would move down
[time=3479] the road, some distance to take this challenge and apply this truth to their lives.
[time=3486] I pray they'd write it down, I pray they'd keep track, I pray they'd talk to friends about it.
[time=3491] But God, give us grace and strength as we bless you this week, as we praise verbally
[time=3497] your name, as we brag about you from our souls and as we magnify, not diminish you with
[time=3504] our lives, bring us back together again, God, soon, if that be your will, so that we can
[time=3510] have the privilege of doing what David said there at the end of that third verse, that we might exalt your name, that we might make much and lift high your name together, and
[time=3521] we'll thank you for it in your son's name.
[time=3523] [AMEN] God bless you, have a great week.
