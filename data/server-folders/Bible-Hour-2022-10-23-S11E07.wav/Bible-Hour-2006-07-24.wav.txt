[time=30] >> Hi, my name is Sam Barfel, and I have the absolute privilege of serving as a superintendent
[time=38] of Blackout Christian School, which is located right here in Northeast Fort Wayne. And I want to just tell you a little bit about our school. Blackout Christian School has been in existence for over 30 years, and we have about 770 students in grades preschool through the 12th grade.
[time=54] And one of the, one of the, I just messed up, I'll start over.
[time=58] I just go with that same start. Yeah, here we go. Hi, my name is Sam Barfel, and I have
[time=64] the privilege of serving as a superintendent of Blackout Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne. And Blackout Christian School has been in existence for just over 30 years, and I'd like to take this opportunity just to share some of the exciting things about what we get to do as a Christian school. First of all, we use a line around here that goes
[time=82] like this. We believe Blackout Christian School provides academic excellence on a biblical foundation. And there are two parts to that. The academic excellence is something that we pursue hard, and we have a rigorous curriculum that we challenge our students to give their very best and be the very best student that God's called them to be. But the other part of that is the biblical foundation. Everything that we teach comes from the truth of scripture, and the premise of everything we teach comes from that scriptural base. And that is what
[time=111] we call teaching truth. And then the other thing I'd like to tell you about is our faculty.
[time=115] We just have an incredible team of people who make up the teachers and the faculty of the staff of Blackout Christian School. And these people have given their professional lives and their ministry lives to serving the students that God has by his sovereignty placed right
[time=131] here in our school to provide that academic excellence on a biblical foundation. And it is my pleasure to work next and alongside those who are the faculty and staff of Blackout
[time=142] Christian School. They are second to none. I'm convinced of that. And I would like to just encourage you and challenge you during these summer months as you're thinking about next fall, school starting up again, to think about and explore the possibility of your child,
[time=156] your students becoming part of the family here at Blackout Christian School. And I would challenge you to give us a call and let us give you what we call a tour and a talk. Walk through our facilities so you can catch kind of a heart glimpse of what we're about and what we're trying to accomplish and how we're trying to partner with parents who want their children to walk in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ. And how that and education are just seamlessly welded together in such a powerful way. And so I invite you to give
[time=185] us a call, get on our website and contact us and let us give you some more information
[time=192] about Blackout Christian School. Thanks so much. We look forward to hearing from you.
[time=200] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=210] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all men. Adaptizing them in the name of
[time=222] the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teaching them to observe all I have to command you. And
[time=235] lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=252] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries and it is good to be
[time=260] with you again. I am so looking forward to the beginning of August and an event here at Blackhawk that we are so excited about. A chance to host again what is known as the
[time=271] Leadership Summit. You have heard me in recent weeks talk about the Leadership Summit and I am so thankful for the team over at Willow Creek and their commitment to bring the summit
[time=282] to people just like you and me who have a desire to have godly biblical principles instilled
[time=289] into our leadership lives. And I know as you watch this this morning, there may be a number of you in a number of different settings and I just wanted to briefly speak to just a couple of those. If you are in the marketplace, maybe you are a businessman here in the Fort Wayne area, maybe you are a business woman, maybe you are a part of an organization or you own your own company. If you are in that marketplace world, you very likely have heard the name
[time=314] Jim Collins. Jim Collins is a noted, nationally known author and speaker, has written books
[time=321] such as Good to Great and Built to Last. And Jim Collins has a personal faith that just
[time=328] bleeds into what he reads and the presentations that he gives and he is going to be part of
[time=334] this year's Leadership Summit team of speakers. I hope you will come and listen to what he has to say. I am so looking forward to seeing how Jim Collins and others like him and the
[time=345] message that they bring. I am so looking forward to seeing how it will inspire and encourage you in your marketplace leadership endeavor. You know what, if you are part of the local
[time=355] church, if you give your nights and days like I do to church ministry, I can't tell you enough
[time=361] about our good friend Bill Heibels. I am so thankful for the love and the passion and
[time=367] the enduring commitment that Bill has to seeing the local church prevail, seeing the local church be all that God intended it to be. And if you have never heard Bill or if
[time=378] you have heard him in the past, either way I would invite you to come again and get your heart and your mind and your soul filled up all over again with the life changing truth
[time=388] about who God has called you and I to be as we try to lead and love his bride. Hey, I also want to mention this. You have heard me say in the past that Bono is going to be with us this year. That is true. Bono, the lead singer of you too. And you may not know much about Bono and his faith. I am learning as I go a little bit more about his profession,
[time=409] his belief in Christ and his commitment to the Lord. And it has been an interesting journey for me. Where Bono is with God personally, I can't speak to that but what I can speak
[time=421] to is what I have seen Bono do with his life. What I can speak to is the way that he has given himself to those in need. What I can speak to is this enormous passion and an honor
[time=432] to honor God, this enormous passion to give to those who are in need, the sick and the
[time=439] poor of this world. The way he has come at that and the message that he has for us on
[time=445] that front is something I would want each and every one of us to understand. So come and be with us. We would love to have you. Just go to the BlackhawkMinistries.org website
[time=455] and as part of our Blackhawk family, which we consider you part of our family, just go to the leadership summit link at our website. And then I want you to write this down. Summit host. Summit host. One word, that's the password that you'll need to access our special rate
[time=473] that we want to offer to you as part of our family. We would love to have you here. Go to the website, register yourself. Summit host is the password that you'll need and we'll look forward to having you with us in August as we learn more about what God intends for us as leaders. We will remember. We will remember. We will remember the works of your hands.
[time=512] We will stop and give you praise for great is thy faithfulness. We will remember. We
[time=529] will remember the works of your hands. We will stop and give you praise for great is thy
[time=545] faithfulness. You're our creator, our life sustainer, deliverer, our comfort, our joy
[time=563] throughout the ages. You've been our shelter, our peace in the midst of the storm.
[time=573] With signs and wonders, you've shown your power. With precious blood, you've shown
[time=585] us your grace. You've been our helper, our liberator, the gamer of life with no grace.
[time=599] We will remember. We will remember. We will remember. We will remember the works of your
[time=611] hands. We will stop and give you praise for great is thy faithfulness.
[time=627] Our God's faithfulness is great. He is a God of integrity. What he promises to do, he
[time=635] will do. What he says he is, he really is. And when he says that he's going to complete
[time=642] the work that he began in you, he's really going to do it. We're going to sing this next
[time=648] song, I mean this next verse, excuse me, that talks about all the hard times and how God
[time=656] is faithful even in the midst of those. And then it gets to this point where it says how we will shout that God is good. And when we get there, I really want to do it. I really want to shout praises to God. The Psalms say that we can shout praise to him. So I'm going
[time=672] to invite you to stand and we're going to sing this verse together. When we get to the part to shout, just lift your voice to him.
[time=688] When we walk through life's darkness about peace, we will look back at all you have done.
[time=699] And we will shout, our God is good. And he is the faithful one.
[time=710] Sing a hallelujah, hallelujah to the one from the sings of, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=727] Hallelujah to the one whose glory has been show. We will remember, we will remember,
[time=743] we will remember the works of your hands. We will stop and give you praise for grace.
[time=756] He is thy faithfulness.
[time=763] Let's sing this next verse with Kevin. Still remember the day he saved.
[time=775] I still remember the day you saved me.
[time=781] The day I heard you call out my name. You said you loved me and would never leave me.
[time=792] Sing it out.
[time=793] And I never been the same.
[time=798] We will remember.
[time=799] We will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your hands.
[time=813] We will stop and give you praise for grace is thy faithful name.
[time=822] One more time we'll remember, we will remember.
[time=828] We will remember, we will remember the works of your hands.
[time=838] And give you praise for grace is thy faithful name.
[time=860] As Corbin plays just a little bit more, I want to just remind you of something.
[time=864] And you have this experience I'm sure in the everyday of your life.
[time=869] My experience is no different than yours.
[time=871] When you think about ten years and the opportunity God's given me and my family to be a part
[time=877] of this family with you, part of, there's a lot that brings a great deal of joy to our
[time=883] hearts.
[time=884] Part of what brings us great joy is that for ten years you've allowed me and us in a sense
[time=890] to see Him faithfully bring you through so much.
[time=898] When you're ten years with people you get to know them and you get to see into the realities of their lives.
[time=904] And I can just look around this room this morning and I just see faces.
[time=907] And the faces are, as I've said before, connected to a story.
[time=912] And this room is just full of his faithfulness being lived out through the life change and
[time=919] transformation that I see all over this room.
[time=924] And so what a great thing to remember, the faithfulness of God and what a great privilege for us to be able to come together this morning to hear from and study and give our hearts
[time=934] to the Word of God.
[time=936] Can I just read for you please with you standing?
[time=938] Can I read for you Psalm 1?
[time=940] What a great, great Psalm.
[time=942] And my hope and my prayer for you this morning is that each and every one of you, young and old and somewhere in between, no matter who you are, no matter where you've been, my hope is that you would open your heart and your life to the great truth of God's Word this morning.
[time=957] This is a powerful, powerful passage.
[time=961] It says in Psalm 1, "How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
[time=968] nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers.
[time=973] But his delight is in the law of the Lord, the Word of God.
[time=978] And in his law he meditates day and night.
[time=983] He will be the man that does that.
[time=984] He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in its season.
[time=991] And its leaf does not wither and in whatever he does he prospers.
[time=998] The wicked are not so.
[time=1001] But they are like chaff, which the wind drives away.
[time=1006] Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
[time=1013] For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish."
[time=1021] We have the privilege this morning of having one of our teaching pastors, Steve Longbreak come and take us through this passage and I just want to say to you, again what I've said to you in the past, in 10 years of ministry here, if you ask me what I'm most thankful for, Steve Longbreak would be, he'd be up the top of the list.
[time=1039] His love for this place, the years that he has invested here, the wisdom and the insight that God has given him, has been something that has been so, so much appreciated by many,
[time=1050] myself included.
[time=1051] He has helped me in times where I needed help.
[time=1055] He has encouraged me at times where I needed encouragement.
[time=1058] And again, the wisdom and the insight, it has been a resource.
[time=1062] I couldn't begin to tell you how God has used it to shape and form my own heart and
[time=1068] this ministry.
[time=1069] And so I know you're thankful for him.
[time=1070] I know I am welcome and if you would, Steve Longbreak is going to come this morning.
[time=1083] No, I would like for you to stay standing and serving the whole message today.
[time=1089] Nobody told you to sit down right now.
[time=1096] I think, I met Kelly, you know, listening to him say all that.
[time=1099] I think I met him the first time it was like 92, like the summer 92 or something like that.
[time=1103] Was Russell been here about a year and I'd heard about Kelly Bird, I was sick of hearing about Kelly Bird because Russell liked to play two on two basketball.
[time=1114] And if I was his partner or teammate or anybody else, once in a while, he lost.
[time=1121] And he hates losing.
[time=1124] And it was always the partner's fault, his teammates' fault.
[time=1129] And he kept saying, just wait till Kelly comes.
[time=1133] Just wait till Kelly comes.
[time=1135] I was so, Kelly who, Kelly what?
[time=1138] Well, Kelly showed up over at Russell's house and actually, I don't know the first time
[time=1145] we played.
[time=1146] It might even have been in this gym now that I think about it more.
[time=1148] But Barce and I are somebody else were partners and Russell had his dream come true.
[time=1153] Kelly was back, you know, in his life.
[time=1156] And I was the tallest on our team and so I'm guarding that right there.
[time=1163] And it's not fair.
[time=1165] Here's the best part.
[time=1167] Russell would be totally frustrated if Kelly didn't just hammer the people he was playing with.
[time=1173] Because Russell got this vicarious rush, it was like he was doing it.
[time=1177] You know, he's just a teammate and he would enjoy, he wanted to win by as many as possible all the time.
[time=1184] And so Kelly would just eventually, Russell would get mad at Kelly for not playing so hard.
[time=1189] Kelly always had mercy on people like me, but Russell hated that.
[time=1193] To this day, he still feels like he had something to do with winning those games when it was
[time=1199] all you.
[time=1204] I never did beat him at basketball, I'll tell you that for sure.
[time=1207] I have beaten him in some other things a couple times.
[time=1211] Well, Chad, where are you?
[time=1216] I don't know a whole lot about you, I know a little bit about you, but you must be something if she picked you.
[time=1224] Because she had her choice.
[time=1228] And I know a lot about Kim.
[time=1232] Watching her grow up, you know, Kim's family went to a manual, Jim and Debbie Schweicher, and their kids.
[time=1239] And that church started Black Hawk, and eventually, I don't know when it wasn't, you guys started coming over.
[time=1245] When did you come to the school, Kim?
[time=1246] What grade?
[time=1247] Fourth grade.
[time=1248] So they started coming to the church, and I got to watch her grow up.
[time=1254] And you hit the marital jackpot, buddy.
[time=1262] And I'm just so thankful that you guys are doing ministry over there in Paris.
[time=1267] And now, you know, Josh has been telling me how you're just ready to really get started now doing the planting, and that's really exciting.
[time=1273] Thanks for serving him.
[time=1274] And thanks for staying faithful.
[time=1279] She's ours.
[time=1282] I love that.
[time=1283] When missionaries that we're talking about are the ones that we grew up.
[time=1289] And then those of you that are missionaries in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in the marketplace here, and we got a chance to help grow you up, oh man.
[time=1298] Those of you that are in your neighborhoods are being the insider as the navigators call it.
[time=1303] Those of you that I'm so thankful for that.
[time=1305] And the fact that we get to do that together, that we get to impact eternity together, what
[time=1312] a privilege.
[time=1315] Renee and I were at a navigators conference in St. Mary's, Ohio, Grand Lake, St. Mary's.
[time=1327] And a freeborn had invited us to come to this navigators conference in 1975.
[time=1334] And so we went.
[time=1336] I asked him, you know, what do we need to take?
[time=1339] He said nothing.
[time=1340] Everything's provided.
[time=1341] Well, that wasn't true, of course.
[time=1343] We got there.
[time=1344] There was a bed with no sheets, no pillowcases, no towels, no blankets.
[time=1351] And it wasn't in the summertime.
[time=1356] I'm still trying to figure out how to pay him back for that one.
[time=1361] We had a bathroom that, I remember this well, there was kind of a chain that went from one door to the other that kept people out of the room.
[time=1367] I'm still trying to figure out how that worked because how could the chain keep it from opening from the, I don't get that anyhow.
[time=1374] But that was like that.
[time=1375] And so ours was broken, and I know Renee and I both were really enjoying trying to use the facilities and keep the door closed at the same time.
[time=1387] So there were some memorable parts to that trip, but there was one that's more memorable than that.
[time=1392] Skip Gray, he was the president of the navigators then.
[time=1396] He was the speaker, and he said, a couple of things I remember really well that he said one was, he said, on my tombstone, I already have it written now, he said, I want them to say the earth, the grave, the skies, hallelujah.
[time=1409] And it made me think about tombstones and I've thought a lot about what I want on my tombstone.
[time=1420] But what he taught us that was really a lot more significant than that was, he said, he
[time=1426] said really like for you to consider memorizing Psalm 1.
[time=1430] So in 1975, on the way from the navigators conference in St. Mary's back to Columbus,
[time=1436] we memorized Psalm 1 in the car.
[time=1439] And I had King James Bible then, and so I memorized it in King James, and now I'm always confused because I do NAS sometimes, NIV sometimes, and the King James stuff shows up, I always
[time=1449] know when the "the" or "the" is there.
[time=1452] And we memorized that, and for the last, that's been 31 years now.
[time=1457] For 31 years, I have been meditating on Psalm 1 and meditating on the scriptures because
[time=1465] of Psalm 1.
[time=1468] And so when they asked me which Psalm I wanted to teach on this summer, I said Psalm 1, if
[time=1475] nobody else has it, because I've been thinking about it for 31 years.
[time=1482] And so today, you're going to stay a while because I got 31 years' worth.
[time=1492] Let's look at it again, Kelly read it to us.
[time=1497] In Psalm 1, there's a big idea.
[time=1501] When you look through the scriptures and you get ready to teach or preach, it's important
[time=1507] to make sure that you think through what it is that God is saying in that text.
[time=1513] It's easy for me to take my message to a text.
[time=1518] It's easy for me to find verses that support something I want to say.
[time=1523] But it's really important, especially look at a whole book.
[time=1526] Get the theme of the book and how the theme fits in the redemptive history of the Bible and where it fits.
[time=1531] And then when you take a specific passage out of a book, think about how that context relates to what's in the book that God wrote there.
[time=1539] And then think about what is the big idea in this specific passage that you're looking at.
[time=1545] And so I was doing that this week getting ready for Psalm 1 and actually for the last two months.
[time=1551] And one of the big ideas that I came up with was this.
[time=1555] It's a question that I think is in there and it's a question that I ask based on what I see in the text.
[time=1563] How are the righteous and wicked different?
[time=1570] That's one of the ideas that God obviously reveals to us in this text.
[time=1573] How are the righteous and the wicked different?
[time=1581] Psalm 1, "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked."
[time=1589] It doesn't mean that he's never with the wicked.
[time=1593] It means he doesn't walk in their counsel.
[time=1596] He's not looking for them to give him directions.
[time=1599] You know, you can get some pretty wise advice, advice from some learned people about some
[time=1605] very practical things.
[time=1608] But be careful when your advice is coming from non-believers.
[time=1615] The most dangerous wicked counsel is the counsel that appears to be light.
[time=1624] The most dangerous wicked counsel is the counsel that seems right in your own heart and in your own mind.
[time=1631] You know, Satan's not the most dangerous when he looks really wicked.
[time=1636] Satan is the most dangerous.
[time=1636] The Bible says he masquerades as an angel of light.
[time=1640] That's a dangerous Satan right there.
[time=1643] And his disciples who masquerade as children of light are dangerous.
[time=1649] Satan is the man that does not walk in their counsel or in the wicked's counsel.
[time=1659] Or stand in the way of sinners.
[time=1663] Paul said we're going to be in the world.
[time=1665] He said he's never telling us to come out of the world in 1 Corinthians.
[time=1669] He said you're supposed to be in the world.
[time=1673] But while we're in the world we don't get our counsel from the world and we don't stand their way.
[time=1680] We look different even when we're there.
[time=1684] We're going to be different from them.
[time=1686] We're aliens and strangers in this world once we've been adopted by God.
[time=1694] And we don't sinners and we don't sit in the seat of moccas.
[time=1697] And that one, you know, some of us really need to pay heed to that one.
[time=1702] It's real easy to be a person who sits around.
[time=1704] You know, remember when we talked about the sins of summer?
[time=1708] It's really easy for us to sit around and be with the grumblers and the complainers and the mockers and the scoreners.
[time=1713] It's really easy to participate in that.
[time=1716] Sometimes participating by listening instead of confronting.
[time=1722] I don't think we do a very good job at lovingly confronting gossip, murmuring, grumbling, one
[time=1728] on one.
[time=1729] We have a tendency to be quiet and listen, that's bad participation.
[time=1736] The man who doesn't do that.
[time=1737] The man who does not walk in the council of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners
[time=1743] or sit in the seat of moccas says, instead of that, what's he do?
[time=1748] Look at the next verse.
[time=1750] But his delight, his delight is in the law of the Lord.
[time=1756] And on his law, he meditates day and night.
[time=1765] You know, that makes sense to me.
[time=1769] A person who's born again, meaning I've realized I'm separated from God, I've sinned all of
[time=1779] us are guilty.
[time=1781] And that God had a plan and through his redemptive plan, Christ died for my sins as a sinner.
[time=1793] And if I realize that and I realize therefore I'm not going to be judged for my sin because
[time=1799] Christ paid for it already.
[time=1801] Then I have relationship with him and I say, oh my goodness, the Father by grace paid my
[time=1807] debt so that I don't have to go to hell and be separated from Him and I can bring Him glory.
[time=1814] If you really believe that, you should be going, to me, it's like this, oh my goodness.
[time=1819] I was separated and I got to be with the eternal creator of everything forever and give Him praise and glory instead of being separated from Him and weeping and gnashing of Keith Ville.
[time=1830] Oh my goodness.
[time=1833] So then my response is, who do you want me to be?
[time=1838] What do you want me to be like?
[time=1840] What do you want my behavior to be?
[time=1842] And then I go and then I've been taught that He has revealed what He wants us to be like
[time=1848] in here.
[time=1850] So if I'm a righteous man, if I'm blessed by God and He's redeemed me through the blood
[time=1857] of Christ, then I go, what's this say about me and what's He want me to do?
[time=1862] And I esteem these words and His revelation and I long for that and it becomes a delight
[time=1870] and people like that, when they bump into something that causes them to quit doing something
[time=1876] they've been doing and start doing something else or start doing something that they haven't
[time=1882] been doing, either way, when that gets revealed to them, they go, oh, instead of, oh no, instead
[time=1893] of, oh no, I don't think I can do that, it's, oh, that's what I've been looking for.
[time=1897] One of the things I'm supposed to do that are different, God, that's what I want.
[time=1900] That's the delight.
[time=1902] It's a delight to discover that you've been doing it the wrong way and He's told you you can do it this way and He gives clear direction about that.
[time=1911] His delight is in the law of the Lord and on His law He meditates day and night and He
[time=1919] shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, living water.
[time=1925] This living water right here, Jesus said, let me tell you about living water, remember the woman at the well, let me tell you about living water.
[time=1933] He says, I'm living water.
[time=1935] He's the Word, He's the Word in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
[time=1941] He's the Word.
[time=1943] This is a living thing, the Word of God is quick and powerful, living and active.
[time=1947] It's a living thing, sharper than any double-edged sword and it penetrates my heart and
[time=1954] it helps me recognize that I shouldn't do that or I should do that.
[time=1957] When I meditate on it day and night, this living water will make me fruitful.
[time=1964] Man, I want this.
[time=1967] I delight in this.
[time=1970] It says if he meditates on it day and night, I was with this Indian guy last week and I
[time=1980] told him I was going to preach on Psalm 1 and since he was from India, I said, why don't you tell me about meditation because, you know, in the 60s especially, John Lennon got into Rabbi Shankar and all those guys and they were all doing the guru meditation stuff and I remember thinking about all that stuff and some of you who are my age remember this and he said, this is the difference between meditation in Eastern religions and in real
[time=2005] Christianity.
[time=2007] So my ears perked up.
[time=2009] And he said, meditation, according to most religions, is about emptying yourself, sitting
[time=2017] in the corner, knees crossed, kind of the mantra deal, waiting to be levitated out of
[time=2025] yourself to be one with God.
[time=2030] He said, real Christianity is about being filled by him.
[time=2033] He said, it's about being filled, yeah, you deny yourself, that's still true.
[time=2042] But he comes in and dwells in you and when you meditate on his word, what it does it is empowers the spirit of God to fill you up and his ways start living out in your body.
[time=2055] Wow.
[time=2058] So it's like streams of water.
[time=2061] I was down at Bob Freeborn's house the other day and I was talking about trees.
[time=2067] I said, we need to plant some trees in our yard out there where we live.
[time=2071] And he said, man, you got to plant one of these oaks that I planted.
[time=2074] He said, it just grew so fast.
[time=2078] I said, what?
[time=2079] He said, yeah, he said, these really grow fast.
[time=2082] Bob doesn't know a thing about farming.
[time=2083] I said, man, oaks don't grow fast.
[time=2086] He said, this one did.
[time=2088] I had a hard time believing it, well, he took me down to the bottom of his driveway.
[time=2094] All of the houses on Pemberton on his side of the street sit on a high hill.
[time=2099] All of the street and the trees that are planted between the sidewalk and the street sit at the bottom of the hill.
[time=2107] He planted a noke in there and in seven years it gives great shade because it's planted
[time=2114] in streams of water.
[time=2117] The water comes down off those hill sides and fills that area up between the sidewalk and the street with water on a regular basis.
[time=2125] It doesn't just get its water that comes down from the sky.
[time=2129] It gets the water that fell on the houses and the driveways and the yards above it.
[time=2135] And that tree's big.
[time=2137] He's right.
[time=2138] It grew a lot faster than any oak I've ever seen.
[time=2144] The tree or chaff says he meditates on it.
[time=2151] The Bereans are a great example.
[time=2153] In Acts 17, in Acts 17, the Bereans, the Bible says, Luke wrote this about them.
[time=2162] They read the Scripture.
[time=2164] Look at this.
[time=2166] The Bereans were of noble character than, more noble character than the Thessalonians.
[time=2170] That's interesting, isn't it?
[time=2173] In Acts 4, they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures
[time=2179] every day to see if what Paul said was true.
[time=2183] I love it.
[time=2185] They're evaluating Paul every day.
[time=2187] I don't care how flowery your speech is, well, he wasn't really that flowery a speaker, but he did have a lot of knowledge.
[time=2194] Everybody that teaches you the Bible, everybody that teaches you anything spiritual, everybody that counsels you in any way, you need to test what they say by looking through here
[time=2205] to see if what they say is true, like the Bereans did.
[time=2209] They meditated on the Bible day and night every single day they examined the Scriptures
[time=2215] to find out if Paul was speaking the truth.
[time=2217] Our elders have a specific role here to do that.
[time=2219] If Kelly or Mitchell or I are any Sunday school teacher in the place is teaching any heresy whatsoever, it is imperative that our elders stand up against that.
[time=2229] But they have to be examining the Scriptures all the time to find out, to make sure that it's in harmony with the Scripture.
[time=2234] That's your job, too.
[time=2238] The Blessed Man, he meditates on the Word of God day and night.
[time=2244] He's like a tree planted by streams of water which brings forth fruit in its season.
[time=2250] I was thinking about that a lot.
[time=2253] You know, Joshua's fruit, we just studied him.
[time=2255] Joshua's fruit started appearing a little after age 80.
[time=2261] Caleb's fruit, he tasted the fruit and wanted it earlier on before the 40 years in the wilderness.
[time=2270] But his fruit started to bear when he was over 80.
[time=2276] In its season, I don't need to go any longer with that.
[time=2278] We don't know when it is.
[time=2279] God decides what your season is.
[time=2284] And whose leaf does not wither, whatever he does, prospers.
[time=2288] Now prospers may be about some physical prosperity.
[time=2293] It may be about physical poverty.
[time=2299] Prospering here doesn't have anything to do with just the physical.
[time=2303] It might be, but it has everything to do with us being a prosperous person.
[time=2310] What fruit do you want to bear?
[time=2313] What kind of fruit do you really want to bear?
[time=2316] I want to bear spiritual fruit.
[time=2323] The wicked, they're not like that.
[time=2327] It says in verse 4, "Not so the wicked, they are like chaff that the wind blows away." Have you ever seen chaff?
[time=2334] If you ever get a grain of wheat or a grain of oats or a grain of barley, any kind of thing that has a husk or Kelly's laugh and goes, "He's never done this in his life." Farmboys know what I'm talking about.
[time=2345] You take that grain, the head of the wheat or oats off.
[time=2348] You can take that whole head off, and it's got husks chaff around it.
[time=2354] And when you put it in your hand, when it's ready to pick and it's dry enough, you can rub it like that, and the chaff goes, and the wheat goes into the basket.
[time=2369] The ungodly, the wicked, are like the chaff, just blown by the wind.
[time=2376] They do whatever comes naturally.
[time=2381] But the wheat, the fruit, they're the righteous, and they drop into the basket and are useful.
[time=2391] Not useless.
[time=2393] Or forever, forever, forever.
[time=2404] You know, Nancy and I are both wannabes.
[time=2409] You know what a wannabee is?
[time=2412] Wannabee kind of showed up.
[time=2413] I think it was like the gangs.
[time=2415] There were guys that wannabee, you know, and they really weren't in the gang.
[time=2418] They just were wannabee gang members.
[time=2420] I can't, really, I used to be able to do this better.
[time=2428] The wannabees are the people that they kind of hang around the band.
[time=2433] They hang around the team.
[time=2435] They have a desire to be.
[time=2437] Nancy and I are both kind of wannabees.
[time=2439] We both wannabee more structured.
[time=2443] We talk about it.
[time=2445] Now, fortunately for me, she's an unstructured, neat person.
[time=2451] She still keeps things neat.
[time=2453] But I'm an unstructured, messy person.
[time=2456] Now, I want to be structured.
[time=2458] I want to be more organized.
[time=2459] I want to know where I'm supposed to be at what time, but I struggle with that.
[time=2464] You know what the law does?
[time=2467] This brings his structure to my mess.
[time=2476] His structure comes to my mess.
[time=2480] Guess what?
[time=2481] Sometimes your mess is too much structure.
[time=2487] Your structure.
[time=2488] Yeah, I'll point at you on that one.
[time=2491] Too much structure.
[time=2496] Sometimes though.
[time=2498] His structure is about just seeing real needs that you'd overlook.
[time=2507] When I meditate on his law, his structure comes into my mess and I start to see things
[time=2514] his way.
[time=2518] Matthew 5, 17.
[time=2522] Jesus was talking in the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2526] Let's go there.
[time=2527] It says, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.
[time=2533] I've not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them."
[time=2539] I tell you the truth.
[time=2540] Until heaven and earth disappear.
[time=2543] Not the smallest letter.
[time=2545] Not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
[time=2553] Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2569] Now, you know what?
[time=2571] That seems a little extreme, doesn't it?
[time=2575] He is.
[time=2578] When Jesus teaches, you very rarely find him preaching on something at the end of it.
[time=2583] You go, "That's pretty nice.
[time=2586] That's kind in the middle.
[time=2588] It's extreme." He says that he didn't come to abolish the law.
[time=2596] He came to fulfill the law.
[time=2598] What he did was, listen to this, he fulfilled the law and then moved into me so that I can
[time=2606] understand it and obey it, because it's only by his strength that we can ever do anything
[time=2613] good.
[time=2615] He dwells in us and empowers us, and when we know the word and our minds are right, we're
[time=2621] then able by his power to obey the word.
[time=2626] He didn't get rid of the law, he fulfilled it and makes it possible for us to live under
[time=2633] it.
[time=2634] Now, I know you can't be perfect.
[time=2635] We know that, but there definitely is an ability that we have, in Christ, to be obedient in
[time=2643] ways that we were never able to be obedient before.
[time=2649] He didn't come to abolish it.
[time=2651] He came to fulfill it, and we need to be really careful as blessed, righteous people to never
[time=2658] teach falsehood, never teach heresy, never counsel people with human counsel, because
[time=2670] the wicked do that.
[time=2672] They're like chaff that the wind blows away.
[time=2675] Verse 5, "Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the assembly
[time=2682] of the righteous, for the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the
[time=2691] wicked will perish." You see, the blessed man is not standing, is not listening to, for counsel is not sitting
[time=2704] with the wicked, he is on the way, he's on the way that God laid out.
[time=2715] Jesus said, "I am the way," the truth in the life.
[time=2721] The righteous man is on the way.
[time=2723] God didn't call us to just sit in a place, he called us in Christ heaven word, that's
[time=2730] the way.
[time=2731] I'm on the way somewhere.
[time=2735] Bad counsel will get me off that way and on to the wrong way.
[time=2740] Sitting with mockers will keep me from being progressively moving on the way heaven word in Christ Jesus.
[time=2749] The way of the wicked will perish.
[time=2751] You see, they can't stand.
[time=2754] They can't stand in the judgment.
[time=2757] They're going to be destroyed in the judgment.
[time=2760] They're going to be separated from God forever.
[time=2765] They're like the chaff, which the wind blows away.
[time=2768] And the Lord will say to them, "The part from me, I never knew you."
[time=2778] And some of them are going to say, "Hold it," Matthew 24.
[time=2781] I did miracles.
[time=2783] I did miracles in your name.
[time=2786] I did all kinds of things in your name and he'll say, "I never knew you."
[time=2792] Because it's not about what you were able to do.
[time=2796] It's about the reality of whether you have received the grace gift from God in me.
[time=2802] Did you receive that?
[time=2803] Did you die to yourself or did you do those miracles in my name for your benefit?
[time=2814] I need to talk to myself there.
[time=2817] Why do I do the things I do?
[time=2819] Sometimes you know what?
[time=2820] I think, "Okay, I'm traveling over here to do this.
[time=2822] I'm preaching here.
[time=2823] I'm teaching that." And it can be about me getting hugs from Kelly when I walk up here.
[time=2831] And it's so easy for me to fall into that trap of just doing it for me.
[time=2839] That's what the wicked are like.
[time=2844] First John 2, verse 3, says, "We know we have come to know Him if we obey His commands."
[time=2853] First John and Psalm 1 have a lot in common.
[time=2856] It drives me right to first John.
[time=2857] First, you want to know if you're a believer?
[time=2860] Read first John.
[time=2861] Now don't talk to somebody else about it.
[time=2864] Read first John and let the Spirit of God convict you and first John is a high bar.
[time=2870] Sometimes when I read that I go, "Oh, maybe it's good for me to go there."
[time=2879] Well know where His disciples, if we keep His commands, will know we come to know Him
[time=2887] if we obey His commands.
[time=2889] Are you delighting in?
[time=2891] Are you looking forward to discovering His commands for you?
[time=2895] Is it a part of your life to say, "Man, I want to know what He wants me to know?" I'm really thankful that He brings His structure into my mess because without this I'd just
[time=2912] be walking around doing my own thing, pleasing me and dishonoring Him.
[time=2918] I'm so grateful for the Word.
[time=2921] Well recently, I've seen chaff and I've seen righteousness and I just want to tell you
[time=2931] about some people.
[time=2937] In June I was in West Africa and in July I was in East Africa and in June in West Africa
[time=2945] I bumped into a righteous guy and from my perspective one of the most righteous guys
[time=2951] I've ever been around.
[time=2953] Now I know I don't know His heart but I was sure impressed.
[time=2958] In July, just last week, Nancy and I were in Uganda in East Africa and the devastation,
[time=2970] the consequences of that wickedness in that country.
[time=2976] You know, it's Edi Amin, remember Him?
[time=2980] And it's the guys before Him and sends Him.
[time=2985] And the devastation, the people are so poor because no matter what they did, if they built something up somebody would come through and ruin what they did and there's no compensation for that.
[time=2996] Raiders would come through.
[time=2997] I talked to one guy.
[time=2998] His grandfather had finally raised up enough cows that he was having enough cows that he could give some cows to his children and grandchildren and they came through, they killed all of his cows, they burned everything he had and they left and so he started over.
[time=3011] They've been starting over like that because they've been surrounded by the wicked for centuries.
[time=3021] And so they're devastated and even sweet people who've come to Christ are struggling
[time=3030] there because of the consequences of the wicked being in charge for all that time.
[time=3037] There's a lot of chaff around there.
[time=3045] I met one guy who both his parents were killed by Edi Amin's people.
[time=3051] I met another guy who his dad, his grandmother, a grandfather and his brother were killed by
[time=3057] the guy that followed Edi Amin and they live in utter poverty.
[time=3064] I'd be really neglectful if I didn't say I saw a bunch of joy-filled poor people there
[time=3072] that were Christians because those circumstances don't necessarily have to keep the individual
[time=3079] from experiencing the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=3083] Now the country's not experiencing fruit but the individuals that are there can experience
[time=3089] fruit, the righteous.
[time=3094] I also want to tell you about a guy that I met in West Africa.
[time=3099] This is a better story.
[time=3103] I was there and we were teaching a group of 15 guys from 10 different countries about some preaching principles, hermeneutics, homiletics and some other truths so that they could then
[time=3114] teach and train pastors in their 10 different countries.
[time=3121] There was a guy that showed up there that was just incredible.
[time=3123] He came in on crutches.
[time=3125] He had a leg that was dangling from his side and I could tell it was backwards because
[time=3134] the tip of his toes were hanging out of his pant leg turned around the wrong way.
[time=3141] The leg just flopped.
[time=3143] We would definitely have taken it off long ago here.
[time=3150] It was 100 degrees in its the rainy season and he's wobbling around those crutches.
[time=3156] I felt so bad for him but you know what, he was so impressive.
[time=3161] Every question he asked was profound.
[time=3166] Every comment he made fit what was being taught.
[time=3170] I looked at his Bible.
[time=3171] The thing was worn out.
[time=3175] Not just the New Testament, my stuff gets pretty crinkly there.
[time=3179] All of it was like that.
[time=3181] Not crinkly but you know oily.
[time=3185] The cover was just about gone.
[time=3187] I'm so impressed with him.
[time=3189] He was so smart.
[time=3190] His questions were always good and when his comments would fit like if you were talking about redemptive history or Christology or something like that, he would have some passage of Scripture that would fit perfectly with what you were talking about and he'd share that.
[time=3205] When he raised his hand, I noticed at the beginning but I didn't know why until later.
[time=3208] When he raised his hand, everybody kind of, he was the F-hutting, everybody just leaned
[time=3214] in.
[time=3215] Man, I was impressed with him and that leg was bad.
[time=3219] No Dama was a guy with him.
[time=3221] O'Dama carried Paul's stuff for him all week.
[time=3225] O'Dama sat in the classes too and took notes but he never made a word.
[time=3228] He never said a word the whole time and I kept noticing this guy.
[time=3231] He carried all this stuff.
[time=3232] When they went to eat, O'Dama would go get the food, bring it back for Paul.
[time=3235] He was his servant.
[time=3237] He just served him the whole time.
[time=3239] At the end of the week, we were having lunch with the leaders of Pioneer's West Africa and they asked us if we could consider somehow getting some money together to help Paul and O'Dama come next January on some means of transportation because it had taken them three
[time=3255] days to get there.
[time=3257] They had to walk a lot of it.
[time=3260] Paul on his crutch, O'Dama carrying everything they needed for a week in that heat in the
[time=3268] rainy season on clay.
[time=3271] Some of you guys really know what I'm talking about there.
[time=3275] And I'm sitting there saying, "Well, yeah, let's give them the money now, send them back home another way." And he said, "They can't do that.
[time=3281] They've made arrangements.
[time=3282] They walk to here, get a ride from here to here.
[time=3284] They walk to here.
[time=3285] They get a ride from here to here.
[time=3286] They walk to here.
[time=3287] They get a ride from here to here." He said, "All the people are waiting to give them the ride, and you can't communicate with anybody, so they have to go back the same way they came.
[time=3295] But next year, could you help us?" And we're both going, "I mean, my heart was breaking.
[time=3299] I'm thinking, 'How stupid are we that we're let that happen?'" Probably cost 50 bucks to get him a good ride or something.
[time=3306] And I said, "By the way, tell me about O'Dama."
[time=3313] He smiled.
[time=3314] I said, "I've been watching him serve Paul.
[time=3319] He just said, 'You won't believe this.'" You see, Paul's not the guy I want to tell you about, the worn out Bible.
[time=3325] I want to tell you about O'Dama.
[time=3328] "O'Dama," he said, "was the team leader in Mali.
[time=3335] O'Dama led Paul to Christ.
[time=3339] O'Dama discipled Paul for a year and a half, but Paul had such capacity that he surpassed
[time=3346] O'Dama early in the process.
[time=3349] And so, O'Dama asked Paul to start discipling him, and he gave Paul the leadership in Mali
[time=3357] and started serving him.
[time=3359] Who do you know like that?
[time=3368] I thought about that.
[time=3371] You talk about a tree planted by living water.
[time=3379] That guy carried his stuff all week.
[time=3382] He was the team leader, but now he's the servant.
[time=3386] It's like Moses becoming Joshua's servant because he had more capacity.
[time=3393] Who do you know like that?
[time=3399] I'm going to read a passage of Scripture, and then we're just going to leave today.
[time=3403] I'm not going to have a closing prayer.
[time=3404] You can pray on your way out.
[time=3405] You can sit there and pray for a minute if you want to.
[time=3407] You can do anything you want, but I want this passage of Scripture to ring in your ears as you leave today.
[time=3412] I want you to think about O'Dama.
[time=3416] I don't know many people who've been the senior leader, recognized the capacity of the younger
[time=3426] and gave them the leadership role to serve them.
[time=3428] I don't know many.
[time=3429] Matter of fact, I've been trying to remember if I know any.
[time=3436] Psalm 119.
[time=3440] I won't read the whole Psalm.
[time=3444] Psalm 119, starting in verse 97, when I finish, you may leave.
[time=3451] Oh, how I love your law.
[time=3458] I meditate it on it all day long.
[time=3466] Your commands make me wiser than my enemies, for they are ever with me.
[time=3472] I have more insight than all my teachers, for I meditate on your statutes.
[time=3480] I have more understanding than the elders, for I obey your precepts.
[time=3484] I have kept my feet from every evil path, so that I might obey your word.
[time=3489] I have not departed from your laws, for you yourself have taught me.
[time=3496] How sweet are your words to my taste.
[time=3500] Later than honey to my mouth.
[time=3503] I gain understanding from your precepts, therefore I hate every wrong path.
[time=3511] Tree or chaff.
