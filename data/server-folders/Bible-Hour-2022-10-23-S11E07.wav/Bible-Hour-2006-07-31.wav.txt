[time=29] >> Hi, my name is Sam Barfell, and I have the privilege of serving as the superintendent of Black Hawk Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=36] And Black Hawk Christian School has been in existence for just over 30 years, and I'd like to take this opportunity just to share some of the exciting things about what we get to do as a Christian school.
[time=46] First of all, we use a line around here that goes like this.
[time=50] We believe Black Hawk Christian School provides academic excellence on a biblical foundation, and there are two parts to that.
[time=55] The academic excellence is something that we pursue hard, and we have a rigorous curriculum that we challenge our students to give their very best and be the very best student that God's called them to be.
[time=66] But the other part of that is the biblical foundation.
[time=69] Everything that we teach comes from the truth of Scripture, and the premise of everything we teach comes from that scriptural base, and that is what we call teaching truth.
[time=80] And then the other thing I'd like to tell you about is our faculty.
[time=83] We just have an incredible team of people who make up the teachers and the faculty, the staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=90] And these people have given their professional lives and their ministry lives to serving the students that God has by His sovereignty placed right here in our school,
[time=100] to provide that academic excellence on a biblical foundation.
[time=103] And it is my pleasure to work next and alongside those who are the faculty and staff of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=110] They are second to none, I'm convinced of that.
[time=112] And I would like to just encourage you and challenge you during these summer months because you're thinking about next fall and school starting up again, to think about and explore the possibility of your child, your students becoming part of the family here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=128] And I would challenge you to give us a call and let us give you what we call a tour and a talk, walk through our facilities so you can catch kind of a heart glimpse of what we're about and what we're trying to accomplish and how we're trying to partner with parents who want their children to walk in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ.
[time=144] And how that and education are just seamlessly welded together in such a powerful way.
[time=151] And so I invite you to give us a call, get on our website and contact us
[time=157] and let us give you some more information about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=161] Thanks so much. We look forward to hearing from you.
[time=171] When Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=178] Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,
[time=187] baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=199] I'm teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=206] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=222] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is the Lamb.
[time=231] And we cry, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus."
[time=238] We cry, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus."
[time=244] We cry, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is the Lamb."
[time=256] Hi, my friends. It's great to be with you again.
[time=266] I want to just share with you this morning about a reality that I don't think we can deny.
[time=271] I think it is an unarguable, undeniable reality that we see in our culture.
[time=277] Culture at large, our Christian culture, among those who claim to be God followers.
[time=283] Even I think this is a reality that continues to grow and grow and grow.
[time=287] And that reality, my friends, is this, marriages are failing, marriages are struggling,
[time=294] marriages are coming apart at the seams at a rate and at a level like we've never seen before.
[time=300] And it breaks my heart that there are millions around the world, thousands in our own community,
[time=306] hundreds, maybe here in our own church, who aren't even coming close to experiencing what
[time=312] God designed for a husband and wife to experience in relationship with Him, God, and in relationship
[time=319] with each other. I am so thankful that about a year ago, there was a time when I'd kind of gotten
[time=326] burnt out to tell you the truth. I was just kind of fed up with all the marriage stuff that was out there. So many books, so many conferences, so many seminars, so many tapes. I think it was
[time=337] just overload. But about a year ago, my interest got peaked and my heart got so encouraged as I
[time=344] got reacquainted with an old friend. His name is Emerson Egrich. And Emerson has written a book
[time=350] called Love and Respect. It comes the theme and the flow of the book comes out of the last verse
[time=358] of Ephesians 5. And there is this idea of love and respect. And the book turned into a conference.
[time=364] And as I read the book and saw clips from the conference, I was so encouraged. And I was so thankful for what God was obviously going to be doing through Emerson. Dr. Dobson has since come
[time=376] across Emerson's material. Focus on the family has started to sponsor and come alongside Emerson
[time=383] in his efforts. And the Love and Respect ministry has just skyrocketed. And we're so thankful for what God is doing there. They're coming here. I want you to know this. Love and Respect.
[time=393] Emerson Egrich, his wife and their whole team, they're coming here to Blackhawk at the end of September. And we want you to join us. It's going to be a two-day conference. And the dates and the
[time=404] times are going to be here on the screen. But I want you to think about coming. Whether you have a great marriage, an okay marriage, or a struggling marriage. And I want you to be honest as you think
[time=414] about it. No matter where you are on that continuum, you need to come and be encouraged. You need to
[time=420] come and be reminded. You need to come and maybe learn for the first time some of the fundamental principles that God has for us as husbands and wives as we seek to love and respect each other
[time=432] in this greatest of all relationships. Emerson's been kind enough to record a clip, kind of a greeting
[time=438] to the Fort Wayne crowd. And so the guys are going to roll that now. And as you listen, I hope your heart will be not only encouraged. I hope there will be a sense in you where as you listen to what he
[time=448] says, you'll want to come and hear more. Stick around. At the end of the clip, there'll be some registration information. And we hope to see you there. I'm so thankful for all of you. And we hope
[time=459] this can be something that will encourage you and your spouse as you seek to have a marriage that could really bring great glory and honor to him. And that could bring great fulfillment and joy
[time=470] to your own hearts and lives. Male and female communication is a fun topic. Have you ever listened
[time=476] to how men and women talk? She says, I have nothing to wear. What she means is she has nothing new.
[time=483] A husband says, I have nothing to wear. What he means is he has nothing clean. I chuckle at that
[time=491] because both are saying the same words, same words I have nothing to wear. And yet they both mean something totally different. Male and female communication, we're different. We're not wrong,
[time=502] we're just different. My name is Emerson Eggrich and my wife Sarah and I are coming to Fort Wayne September 29th. And we're going to be at Black Hawk Church presenting the Love and Respect Marriage
[time=513] Conference. Kelly Bird and others have invited us to come. And we're looking forward to this with great excitement. What's this message all about? Well, Sarah, my wife says this is the conference
[time=523] that men want to attend. And we hope that both husbands and wives will consider coming.
[time=528] But I made a discovery based on Ephesians 533. There the Apostle Paul says, husbands must love
[time=534] their wives and wives must respect their husbands. There's a Love and Respect connection that I saw.
[time=541] When a wife feels unloved, she tends to react in ways that feel disrespectful to her husband.
[time=547] But she doesn't see that. And when a husband feels disrespected, he tends to react in ways that feel unloving to his wife. But he doesn't see that. And thus was born what I call the crazy
[time=559] cycle. Without love, she reacts without respect. And then without respect, he reacts without love.
[time=566] And then without love, she reacts without respect. And without respect, he reacts without love. And this baby starts to spin. And it gets crazy. Have you ever had a conflict with your spouse when suddenly the issue didn't seem to be the issue? You saw their spirit deflate. I believe in the
[time=582] majority of cases a wife is feeling unloved and the husband is feeling disrespected. At the Love
[time=588] and Respect conference, we'll help you discover how to get off that crazy cycle.
[time=592] I want to invite you September 29th to come to the conference. Love and Respect is coming to the
[time=599] region of Fort Wayne. Focus on the family is sponsoring this event. Kelly Bird and all those at Black Hawk Church are preparing for your coming. Please contact the church or go to our website
[time=611] loveandrespect.com. All spelled out loveandrespect.com. And you'll find the contact information there.
[time=618] And we'll find out more about how men and women speak. We'll find out more than just I have nothing
[time=624] to wear. We're so thankful to have you here. And so very thankful to be able to come to the Word of God this morning and our continued study of the Book of Psalms. The way we've been doing
[time=636] this, if you've been with us over the summer, we've called this study a summer in the Psalms growing our hearts for God. And the hope has been, and from what we've heard from you, the response
[time=646] has been great, so very encouraging to hear what God's been doing in your hearts. The hope has been
[time=652] that as we give ourselves to the study, he would renew your heart, he would encourage your heart, he would challenge your heart. He would encourage you in your relationship with him. And our hope is
[time=664] as well that if you're here and you don't know him yet, personally, you haven't come to that place where you fully surrendered your heart and life to him. Our hope is that the great truth found in the Book of Psalms would draw you even closer to him and move you down that road on your
[time=680] journey of faith. I am so thankful to have Bob Purdy here with me this morning. This is a first for
[time=686] Bob and I. I'm so glad he was willing to do this. I'm so thankful for our staff, my friends. We have
[time=692] so many guys on staff who are so able and so willing to use their gifts. And Bob is willing and able
[time=699] this morning to step into this role and join me in bringing you the great truth of this 150th
[time=707] Psalm. If you'll open your Bibles to Psalm 150, now don't be confused. That is the last Psalm
[time=714] in the entire book, but again, it doesn't signify the end of our study. It's just the one Bob and I chose. We're going to take this all the way through the middle of August this series. And I'm so looking
[time=725] forward to the guys who will be coming and teaching the truth that they'll be sharing and the work I think God will do in our lives as they do that. But this morning we come to Psalm 150 and we've
[time=737] entitled this message the truth about praise, the truth about praise. And before we go any further,
[time=745] I'm just going to ask Bob, if he would, read the Psalm for us. It's a short Psalm, six verses,
[time=752] absolutely packed with some amazing truth and some things that we're looking forward to sharing with you this morning. So as hot as you are, would you stand in honor of God's word,
[time=763] keep waving those bulletins in your face. Let's give our focus and our attention to the scriptures
[time=769] here. And Bob, would you read Psalm 150 verses one to six? The Psalmist says, praise the Lord,
[time=777] praise God in his sanctuary, praise him in his mighty expanse, praise him for his mighty deeds,
[time=786] praise him according to his excellent greatness, praise him with trumpet sound,
[time=793] praise him with harp and lyre, praise him with timbrell and dancing, praise him with stringed
[time=800] instruments and pipe, praise him with loud symbols, praise him with resounding symbols,
[time=808] let everything that has breath praise the Lord, praise the Lord. Would you pray with me,
[time=818] Father, God, we humbly and again, Father, expectantly stand before you and in your presence, and God,
[time=827] we are so humbled by that, so thankful that we can do that, so thankful that we can come to you,
[time=833] and we do expect you, and we do ask you again, God, to do what you would do with us today.
[time=838] God, we pray that you would give us a better understanding and maybe even a deeper commitment
[time=846] to a life of praise. God, may we understand this concept more fully, may we practice it more
[time=853] readily, and may we understand the great power that it has. Thank you for the privilege of being
[time=859] together as a family. God, I pray that we would never take for granted, the privilege that is ours
[time=865] to walk through these doors and gather in this place and with great freedom and with great passion,
[time=872] worship our God, expressing our commitment to Him, and so God, as we do that this morning, as we've done that already, and as we continue to do that here in these remaining minutes, we pray that you would be glorified, that your name would be lifted up, and that we could make
[time=888] much of you in your son's name, we pray. Amen. You can be seated. The truth about praise,
[time=895] just briefly and to review a bit, because we talked about this in recent weeks to praise, you might want to write this down. To praise means to compliment. To praise means to, and in the Psalms it talks about verbally doing this with great energy and passion, to compliment, to make much of. It is to, if you will, it is to verbally applaud. If you can just in your mind picture
[time=916] a round of applause, if you can think of an entire room clapping, applauding, complimenting,
[time=923] lifting up, it's to verbally do that. Do that if you would. Every one of you just clap right now.
[time=929] Everybody, just clap. Clap. Okay, ready? Okay, stop that. Okay, then it's just to verbally
[time=935] kind of capture that and do that very thing, to make much of verbally to praise. David here, the psalmist, led as always by the Spirit of God, ends this entire book. Bob and I were just
[time=947] kind of blown away by this. We wanted to just mention this to you. He ends this entire book with this exhortation, with this invitation, with this command to praise the Lord. Think about it,
[time=960] having dealt with 149 chapters. Just think about that. 149 chapters, chapters full of feelings
[time=971] and experiences and emotions and the deep issues of the heart, having traveled through death and fear
[time=977] and deception and judgment and forgiveness and confusion and hopelessness and uncertainty.
[time=984] The psalmist concludes it all by saying, make much of the Lord. Have you been there? Have you
[time=993] experienced that? Have you seen this? Have you gone there? Has God shown himself in this way?
[time=997] Well, praise him, compliment him, verbally proclaim his greatness. Bob, what do you see?
[time=1007] Share with the folks some of the things you saw as you just began to look at the passage here in Psalm 150. Yeah, through the weeks of study and looking at this and preparing, my mind went to praise. What is it? And thanks, praise and thanks. I bounce between those two. I
[time=1026] don't know about you when you pray, when you talk to God, when you think about God.
[time=1031] And I've seen others do it going back and forth. Thank you for this. I praise you for this. And so,
[time=1038] I thought to start today, it would be good to look briefly at that. What's the difference?
[time=1044] And here's what I found. I talked to a lot of people. I did some interviews walking around. What do you think? Thankfulness comes from within. It's a spirit, a heart of gratitude, being
[time=1056] grateful for things done, for action. And it's from within me. It's about something I've experienced.
[time=1066] Thank you for this. Praise what this, what this Psalm is all about is outside of me. It is about
[time=1076] lifting up, making much of, as Kelly said, another. And I looked, I did a little word history real
[time=1084] quick. I'm not a Greek scholar. I didn't go to the Greek, but I went to the English, confessing my background there, and found that this, if you trace this back, this word, praise,
[time=1095] goes back from Middle English to Old French and Late Latin and all those symbols. It goes back
[time=1101] to the Latin word, the original Latin word, pritium, P-R-E-T-I-U-M, I think is the correct
[time=1107] pronunciation, pritium, which is price. And from that Latin word, pritium, we not only get the
[time=1114] word in English of price, but we get the word prize. And those, along with praise, put them all
[time=1122] three together, and it sums up by saying we attach value. We give worth. We recognize. We esteem.
[time=1133] When we praise, we do all of those things. That's good. That's good. And you know, when you look
[time=1140] at the text here, and I want to invite you to do so, as we jump in here, Bob and I were just thankful, as you study a passage, you're always thankful when it just so clearly kind of breaks down for you. I want to just point these things out to you and we're going to make our way through.
[time=1153] Look with me. It just asks and answers some great questions. Where should we praise him
[time=1160] in verse one? In verse two, we're going to see why we should praise our God. Three, four,
[time=1169] and five give you a great practical insight into with what should we praise him? And then verse six,
[time=1177] let's just kind of see who in the end. When it's all said and done, who should? Who among us should
[time=1183] be praising verbally proclaiming the greatness of God? So we'll just kind of make our way through there. Number one, come back with me, if you would, to the first verse. Where should we praise him?
[time=1194] Well, the psalmist is so clear, two places. Praise the Lord, verse one says, praise God in his sanctuary,
[time=1201] praise him in his mighty expanse. In his sanctuary, let me just say this to you briefly. It's a very
[time=1207] simple point. In his sanctuary here in this context would have been referring to the temple of God.
[time=1214] David would be referring to the temple to the place where God's people would gather. The place
[time=1220] where they would gather, to worship God, the place where they would gather, to receive instruction, the place where they would gather, to experience fellowship. He says, praise God in his sanctuary,
[time=1231] and you and I have that very, doesn't look quite the same as far as the temple and where we gather
[time=1238] today, but we have that very same privilege. It says in Hebrews that you and I shouldn't forsake,
[time=1244] that we shouldn't pass up, that we shouldn't let anything else come in the way of us assembling,
[time=1252] gathering together. And he says, when we gather, we should come ready to praise the Lord. When the
[time=1259] body gathers, there is this great privilege, there is this great opportunity for us as a family.
[time=1264] We can do things on our own during the week. We can do things in smaller groups in different settings, but when we come together as a family, he says, part of what should take place there
[time=1275] is this huge commitment to praise him. And when we do that as a family, when we come in through
[time=1283] these doors and you literally sit in these seats and we make a commitment to corporately praise him, to verbally applaud him, to say what's true about him. He says it brings great honor to
[time=1294] him. And you know what? It brings great encouragement. I'll speak for me. It brings great encouragement
[time=1301] to me, to be with you while you praise him. Because you know what? I don't know you.
[time=1309] I know some of you really well. I don't know all of you, but I don't have to know all of you really well to know this. You've been through it in that week, in the six days that have passed
[time=1321] since we've been together, in the six days that have passed in my life, in your life, for you and I to be able to come into this room and still offer praise and still make much of him and still applaud
[time=1332] him for his greatness and his goodness and his faithfulness and his mercy. It's encouraging.
[time=1340] It's encouraging to see your faces and it's encouraging when in the sanctuary we get to make much of him. But he doesn't stop there. He doesn't just say in the sanctuary, and this is what's so
[time=1351] important. Sometimes we think of praise as like a praise service. We think of praising God as something we just do together. He says, no, no, no, no, no. Praise him in his sanctuary, but praise him as well. What's the text say? In his mighty expanse. In his mighty expanse, Dave Walters took
[time=1369] us to Psalm 19 a few weeks ago. I'll remind you of Psalm 19 1. I see that phrase mighty expanse.
[time=1376] It reminds me, what is the mighty expanse? You know what it is, my friends? It's the heavens.
[time=1381] The heavens are telling of the glory of God and their expanse is declaring the work of his hands.
[time=1389] And the King James, I think it says firmament. Praise him in the firmament.
[time=1396] What that is, my friends, is this. It's the total of all earth, sky, and space. It's God's way of
[time=1405] saying to you and I. The sanctuary, the gathering, yes.
[time=1409] And then everywhere else you might go. In heaven, in space, in sky, in mountain,
[time=1422] stream, and work, and shower, and car, wherever you go. All times, all places, if you're somewhere
[time=1432] in his mighty expanse, he says, be praising the Lord. Be willing and ready to have a
[time=1440] spirit that is verbally applauding him, making much of him.
[time=1444] In the gathering, when the body gathers, and wherever else you may go, morning, noon, and night,
[time=1452] the psalmist says, praise the Lord there. Verse two, Bob's going to talk to you a little bit about
[time=1458] why. And I don't want you to miss this. These, verse two, is just filled. He doesn't have time.
[time=1465] We don't have time to tell it to you in total. But just listen, as Bob talks about why it is,
[time=1472] you and I should be so willing to verbally make much of our Lord. And Kelly, listening,
[time=1478] as you went through that on the where, it just occurs to me. There's a couple of things
[time=1486] that God says about praise in his word that I want to just bring to the surface and let
[time=1492] settle as we talk about the rest of this this morning. One is, we are instructed to bring a
[time=1498] sacrifice of praise, a sacrifice of praise to him. And in another place in God's word in the
[time=1506] Old Testament, it says, and don't miss this, that God, the very living God, inhabits the praises
[time=1516] of his people. What does that mean for you and I this morning, that God would inhabit, come in
[time=1523] and take up residence, be there living in the praising of him, that when we take the time to do
[time=1532] this, when we make it a priority, that he will not just say, hey, that's good. He won't just come
[time=1540] along and put his arm around us figuratively. He inhabits it. So as we look at verse two,
[time=1547] we see where we are to praise him. Verse two tells us about why we are to praise him.
[time=1554] And there are two key things, two main things that the psalmist gives us here. The first, we are to praise him for his mighty deeds. The NIV says, for his acts of power, for things done,
[time=1569] for things he is doing today, for things he will do what he's promised to do in the future,
[time=1578] the acts, the actions of God. The second thing he says in that same verse is we are to praise him
[time=1586] for his surpassing greatness. That is who he is, what he's done and who he is. That's why we are
[time=1598] to praise him. Now let's look just a little bit deeper. Real quickly, as I thought through this,
[time=1604] it was not difficult at all to think about some ways that God has exhibited his power,
[time=1611] his acts of power, his mighty deeds in our world. Look at the Old Testament, just a couple to mention.
[time=1618] The nation of Israel comes to the Red Sea and they're standing there. And at his word and the
[time=1626] obedience of his servant Moses, what happens? The sea rolls back. That's a mighty act of power.
[time=1634] Second thing that comes to mind, just before you go on, just real quick, make that personal, just in your mind, in your heart right now, think of a time when he did the impossible.
[time=1644] Wow. Just in your own heart and mind right now, just maybe think of a time where in your relationship and walk with him, he did the impossible. It just seemed as if you were stuck,
[time=1656] the waters were there, you had nowhere to go and he did something amazing. We see no way,
[time=1663] we see no way through it. Right. Keep going, can't go. Second one that came to mind was Israel enters the Promised Land. This long journey, the wandering in the desert, they cross
[time=1673] over, finally Moses doesn't get to go. And then they come to this fortress called Jericho and simply
[time=1683] by marching around without lifting one weapon by the Word of God and his power, the walls of this
[time=1693] fortress disintegrate. Physical manifestation of God's power. Third one, when Elijah,
[time=1702] the prophet in the Old Testament, faced off with the 800 and some prophets of Baal, that idol, and Elijah puts the sacrifice on the altar and drenches it with water and
[time=1717] God's consuming fire comes from heaven and takes up not just the sacrifice but this water drenched
[time=1727] altar. What an exhibition of power. Certainly the miracles of Jesus in the New Testament,
[time=1737] healing, touching. All physical manifestations, because I thought through those,
[time=1744] I thought that's too easy in a sense. We can all take our minds to that as important and significant as they are. So here are three and I'm going to, I'm going to breeze through the, that would be nice, wouldn't it? A breeze right about now. I'm going to breeze through these.
[time=1760] And you'll see when we talk about them, the magnitude of these three, because these three
[time=1770] in my mind rose up as three, not to miss. Three mighty acts of power, not to miss. The first one
[time=1778] is God's power to create. God created. Genesis 1, verses 1 to 3, says in the beginning, God,
[time=1790] what? Created the heavens and the earth and through the days, 1 through 6, he created all of what we see.
[time=1799] The land, the air, the animals, the birds, the fish, the light, darkness and light,
[time=1806] not, this is not the order they were in, the greater light, the lesser light, and he created man.
[time=1812] And it says that he created out of darkness. There was nothing. There was just darkness. There was,
[time=1824] the earth, it said, was void and there was no form to it. Now, here's another verse from Romans 4.
[time=1837] This is a little obscure verse in Romans chapter 4 that you could, you and I could read right by.
[time=1842] Romans 4, 17, when talking about Abraham, the father of all Israel, the one to whom God made
[time=1849] promises. It says, even God who gives life to the dead, and we'll talk about that in a second,
[time=1855] and calls into being that which does not exist. Think about that for a moment with me. God calls
[time=1865] into being that which does not exist. In Genesis 2, to make this personal for you and I, it said that
[time=1872] he breathed the life, the breath of life into us. Imagine if you would, him gathering in his
[time=1879] godly hands, a little dust, right there, before it says, from dust we came and to dust we return,
[time=1888] right? Everybody do that. Everybody just puts your hands right here, just like that. Everybody, just some dust. Just picture what the Scriptures say here. And he forms it and he does this.
[time=1902] And the first breath is of life, is infused into that that he has formed. God created
[time=1914] out of darkness, out of nothing. He called into being you and I that which did not exist.
[time=1924] Here's another quick illustration. One of my all time favorite movies, Apollo 13, real life story,
[time=1933] well documented. Good job, I think, on this one. The Apollo 13 mission was true to the superstition
[time=1942] of 13 if you believe in it. Well, we don't believe in that, but all the things that went wrong on that mission. And in that story, the ship has had its explosion and they are trying to get back.
[time=1957] They're trying to, the mission control is trying to get the astronauts back to earth and they decide
[time=1964] to slingshot them around the moon. And one after another challenge comes up and every time the
[time=1972] scientists, the engineers at mission control in Houston, they recognize and they tackle and they
[time=1980] overcome the challenge. And after several successes, here comes one that they weren't expecting. They
[time=1986] realize that no matter how much they do to get them back, the astronauts are going to die from asphyxiation, from carbon dioxide in the lunar module because it wasn't designed for three people
[time=2000] for so long. And they have to do something to lower the levels of CO2. And they don't have
[time=2006] the right filter because the one that was designed for their ship doesn't fit into the
[time=2012] lunar landing module. So they have to come up with something. And there's a scene in the movie where all of these scientists come into a room that get charged with this task. And they've only got so much time to do this because what, the levels are going up. And we get to see the wonderful
[time=2027] creative minds that God has given to man. They take and dump on this table all of the things
[time=2035] that are in this lunar landing module, right? They spread it all out on the table. This is what they have to work with. And in a matter of a short amount of time, they come up with a plan
[time=2045] to connect a filter, to create and connect a filter that will lower these levels.
[time=2051] And they walk the astronauts through it and it goes down and then they've met the most recent
[time=2058] challenge. And it's an amazing evidence of creativity in the mind of man. Why do I tell you that?
[time=2066] God started with an empty table. There was nothing on his table. These men had a great
[time=2078] challenge. They had to put something together. God started and called into being that, which did not exist. There wasn't anything to work with. That's the first one. Power to create.
[time=2088] Two more. I'll go quicker through these. The second one that I came to, I thought, creation.
[time=2092] What would be next? And this is perhaps, this next one is perhaps, this event. The single most
[time=2101] defining moment in all of history. And that's a bold statement. This event that I'm about to bring
[time=2109] up as praising God for his powers, perhaps the single most defining event in all of history,
[time=2117] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the grave. Why? Every other spiritual leader, teacher,
[time=2128] prophet, pastor, shepherd. Holy man is where? Today. Where? In the grave. Jesus Christ.
[time=2140] Went to the cross, was laid in the tomb and abandoned his spirit and said, essentially,
[time=2152] to God the Father, unless you do this, here I am. You raised me from the dead. And God did it.
[time=2160] So the power to create. Amazing. The power to bring back to life. Incredible. Beyond what we can
[time=2169] imagine or think, but we know to be true. And thirdly, the third one that came to mind
[time=2179] is the power to redeem what he did for you and for me, for Kelly. I watched that and I thought about
[time=2188] the years and the journey and the things we're celebrating today. And I see a man who desires
[time=2195] daily to be shaped and molded and formed into the image of Christ as one that I both work under
[time=2202] and I work with. And in that, it makes it so easy because of where his heart is. And yet,
[time=2210] those things wouldn't be happening in Kelly's life, wouldn't be happening in my life if it weren't for Ephesians 2, where Paul talks about being dead in our sins. And when we were dead in
[time=2224] our sins stuck in the lusts of this world, which by the way, the things we're talking about here,
[time=2230] power and greatness, we'll talk about in a second, those are very appealing to our culture today,
[time=2237] aren't they? Our world seeks after those two things. He reached down into my muck, if you would,
[time=2247] wrist deep, elbow deep. I'm down there. I'm not breathing. I'm stuck in my sin. And it says,
[time=2255] when I was that way, it says, but God who was rich in mercy,
[time=2261] he reached down and he grabbed a hold of me and saved me from my sin.
[time=2269] And the last thought in that verse, you know, acts of power, creation, resurrection, redemption,
[time=2278] it says, praise him for his surpassing greatness. And I would just say this, our God is great. We know that. We measure greatness in a lot of ways in our world,
[time=2289] but our God is not only great. He is beyond all other greats that we have experienced.
[time=2297] You know what, Bob and I's hope is this, my friends, and I really hope that there's a sense
[time=2304] of connection here for you. Our hope is that as you are reminded this morning of God's creative
[time=2311] power, what a thought. As you're reminded this morning of the power displayed in the resurrection,
[time=2318] as you're reminded this morning of his redeeming capacity, we've talked about that so many times,
[time=2325] he makes things, what, new. He takes that which is broken and he puts it back together. He takes
[time=2334] that which is diseased and he heals it. He takes that which was far from him and he brings it close.
[time=2341] He redeems, he transforms, he renews. Our hope is that as you consider these things this morning, I hope these aren't just passing words. Our hope is that it stirs something in you.
[time=2354] I believe this is where the passage is heading. It is to stir something deep in you that's got to
[time=2362] come out. It's to stir something down at the core of who you are, that you long to express.
[time=2369] And if it doesn't, then something's wrong with your heart. If it doesn't stir something in you,
[time=2376] his creative and resurrecting and redemptive power and the red sea and all the things that Bob
[time=2385] talked you through there Elijah, when you think about who he is and what he's done, it should stir something deep in you and look where the passage goes. Now, it just in a practical way begins to prepare us to do this very thing. I'm going to ask Corbin and the team to come up at this time.
[time=2401] Corbin, Bob and I talked this through. Corbin had a great idea and we're just going to let you experience this this morning. It says here in three, four and five, it begins to talk about what we should praise him with. And musically, God has gifted people when the body gathers.
[time=2418] There is this opportunity to have the musical gifting and the talent that God has invested
[time=2424] into people. It leads us and it moves us toward greater expressions of praise. And so what we're
[time=2431] going to do is just take you through here, three, four and five. And Corbin and the team and the band have all kind of worked on this. And if you kind of see where the passage goes, most of you
[time=2442] are familiar with that last verse. Maybe you'll sense where this little exercise is going to move,
[time=2448] but just enjoy this and be so thankful for the folks who have come to kind of lead us in this adventure. Corbin, you guys ready? I think we are. How are we doing over there?
[time=2458] Just getting the last to have you here. We'll be all set. Awesome. Awesome. All right. Watch
[time=2464] this now. Here's how we're going to do this. Verse three, it says, "Praise him with trumpet sound, praise him with harp and lyre." Verse four, "Tembrole and dancing, stringed instruments and pipe,
[time=2475] praise him with loud cymbals." Verse five and resounding cymbals, the end of five. We want to just give you a taste of what that would sound like. Verse three says, "Praise him with trumpet sound."
[time=2486] Don't forget this. Trumpets were used and still are. In many ways, trumpets announced someone. They
[time=2493] announced, they call attention to the dignitary. Does that make sense? Trumpets are a way of
[time=2499] announcing someone who is great. And David says here in the Psalm, we praise him with trumpet sound.
[time=2506] So let's hear that.
[time=2524] Well done.
[time=2532] Let's get through here. The second group is the harp and the lyre, stringed instrument. I like to
[time=2540] think of, if you remember, David was called to play the harp before he was a king for King Saul at the
[time=2547] time. And it was to soothe him and to comfort him. They're comforting instruments. But hey, Corb, I see we don't have a harp up here. So what do we do? Well, if anybody plays the harp,
[time=2558] let me know. We'll work something out. I don't know of any harpists. Yeah, the harp is still an instrument
[time=2565] that we have around today. Not so much of the lyre. Basically, if I take the lid off this piano,
[time=2571] it really resembles the shape of the harp and the principle behind the way that the strings are stretched and plucked is very similar between the piano and the harp. And then also the lyre is in strings that are stretched and plucked over top of a resonating chamber. All of that basically just means it's a guitar. So, basically, we've got guitars and piano to sub in for our harp
[time=2595] and lyre. So here they go. Here we go. Two, three, and...
[time=2616] Well done. All right, verse four goes on and says, it says, "Praise him with temporal, which
[time=2631] would be tambourine and dancing." And, you know, just a reminder, dancing has kind of taken a bad
[time=2637] rap over the years. It's become this thing we don't do talk about or promote. And I understand that,
[time=2644] you know, to a degree, but be reminded, my friends, that David danced. His heart was so full of joy.
[time=2656] His heart was so full of praise. There was such a desire to get out of him, all that was in him,
[time=2664] that he danced unashamedly, unreservedly. He just says he just danced like a wild man.
[time=2672] He was so moved and so wanting to express his joy. And so we don't have a wild man this
[time=2678] morning. We've got some great gals who are so willing to come. And I just, as the tambourine and the dancing takes place, again, realize David says we do this to bring praise and honor to our God.
[time=2690] Tambourine and dancing.
[time=2698] Well done.
[time=2720] Well, from the tambourine, we move to the next group, which is the stringed instruments.
[time=2727] And it says the pipe, which would also be a flute. And I like to think of these. These typically
[time=2734] will be the instruments that tell the story of the music. They carry the melodic line. You think
[time=2741] about a violin in the middle of an orchestra, a flute. And so we have this morning, a violinist,
[time=2749] and a flautist.
[time=2753] Here we go.
[time=2778] Now we move to verse five. It says, "Praise him with loud symbols." I love this. Praise him with loud symbols. Praise him with resounding symbols. Symbols proclaim, my friends. They call attention
[time=2790] too. And it is a great sound. And David says it can be used. And this morning we'll do it with drums. It can be used to give great praise and honor to God.
[time=2808] Wow. There we are.
[time=2819] Well, as we come to the end here to verse six, having walked through all of the six verses now,
[time=2834] we come to who? The psalmist tells us who. Who is to praise him? And it quite simply says,
[time=2842] you remember the hands and the image of the dust and the breathing of that first breath.
[time=2851] The psalmist says, "Let everything that has breath praise the Lord." And as we come to that,
[time=2865] I'd like us to look at the screen. We have just a few passages from the book of Revelation that will re-center again our focus from a different book on this God that we praise this
[time=2877] morning. And in the book of Revelation chapter one it says, "To him who loves us and released us
[time=2886] from our sins by his blood and he has made us to be a kingdom priests to his God and father,
[time=2896] to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[time=2901] "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come the almighty.
[time=2912] Do not be afraid. I am the first and the last and the living one. And I was dead. And behold,
[time=2922] I am alive." What does it say there? Everybody together, I am alive forever more, forever more.
[time=2929] And I have the keys of death and of Hades. And a voice came from the throne saying,
[time=2936] "Give praise to our God all you, his bondservants, everything that has breath.
[time=2944] All you, his bondservants, you who fear him, the small and the great." Then I heard something
[time=2951] like the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty
[time=2957] peels of thunder saying, "Hallelujah, hallelujah, for the Lord our God, the almighty reigns."
[time=2969] Would you stand? Thank you so very much for being here this morning and thank you for giving
[time=2976] yourselves to this study. Just what reminds you of what it said there on the screen, like mighty
[time=2982] peels of what? Thunder. We are to lift our voices and offer our praise. And so would you do that?
[time=2990] Let every one of you in the room this morning who has received breath, would you praise his name
[time=2997] with great passion and with great energy? And let's do that this morning together.
[time=3012] [MUSIC]
[time=3040] Singing everything that has breath, everything now, everything that has breath,
[time=3049] praise the Lord, everything now, everything now, everything that has breath, praise the Lord.
[time=3059] [MUSIC]
[time=3063] Crazy in the morning, crazy in the evening, when I'm young and when I'm old. Crazy when I'm by a fan,
[time=3073] crazy when I'm grieving and never seems enough so. If we could see how much you're worth,
[time=3082] we'll call your might, your endless love. And surely we would never cease to praise you.
[time=3092] [MUSIC]
[time=3099] Everything that has breath, praise the Lord, everything that, everything that,
[time=3106] everything that has breath, praise the Lord.
[time=3113] [MUSIC]
[time=3115] Praise you in the heavens, join with the angels, praise you forever in the day.
[time=3121] [MUSIC]
[time=3123] Praise you on earth now, join with creation, calling on nations to your praise.
[time=3129] [MUSIC]
[time=3130] If they could see how much you're worth, we'll call your might, your endless love.
[time=3138] And surely they would never cease to praise you.
[time=3147] Everything that, everything that, everything that has breath, praise the Lord,
[time=3179] [MUSIC]
[time=3181] Everything that, everything that has breath, praise the Lord,
[time=3198] [MUSIC]
[time=3220] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3229] You are good, you are good, and you're loving the words.
[time=3250] [MUSIC]
[time=3252] Lord, let your glory fall as on that ancient day, storms of enduring love.
[time=3264] [MUSIC]
[time=3266] And then your glory came, and as a side to you, that we would love the same.
[time=3278] [MUSIC]
[time=3280] Our hearts will sing that song.
[time=3284] [MUSIC]
[time=3286] God, let your glory come.
[time=3288] Sing, you are good.
[time=3290] [MUSIC]
[time=3292] You are good, you are good, and you're loving the words.
[time=3333] [MUSIC]
[time=3335] Voices in unison.
[time=3337] [MUSIC]
[time=3339] Killing you thanks in praise.
[time=3343] [MUSIC]
[time=3345] Join by the instruments.
[time=3347] [MUSIC]
[time=3349] And then your glory came.
[time=3353] [MUSIC]
[time=3355] Your presence like a cloud.
[time=3357] [MUSIC]
[time=3359] Of all that ancient day.
[time=3361] [MUSIC]
[time=3363] The priests were overwhelmed.
[time=3365] [MUSIC]
[time=3367] Because your glory came.
[time=3373] [MUSIC]
[time=3375] You are good, you are good, and you're loving the words.
[time=3385] You are good, and you're loving the words today.
[time=3391] You are good, you are good, and you're loving the words.
[time=3413] [MUSIC - 2 seconds] A sacrifice was made.
[time=3421] [MUSIC]
[time=3423] And then your fire came.
[time=3425] [MUSIC]
[time=3427] They knelt upon the crowd.
[time=3429] [MUSIC]
[time=3431] And with one voice they prayed.
[time=3435] [MUSIC]
[time=3437] A sacrifice was made.
[time=3439] [MUSIC]
[time=3441] And then your fire came.
[time=3443] [MUSIC]
[time=3445] They knelt upon the crowd.
[time=3449] [MUSIC]
[time=3451] And with one voice they prayed.
[time=3455] [MUSIC]
[time=3457] They sang, "Come, Lord." [MUSIC - 2 seconds] "Lord, let your glory fall."
[time=3467] [MUSIC]
[time=3471] "Let your glory fall.
[time=3475] Come, Lord Jesus." You are good, you are good, and you're loving the words.
[time=3489] You are good, you are good, and you're loving the words today.
[time=3517] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
