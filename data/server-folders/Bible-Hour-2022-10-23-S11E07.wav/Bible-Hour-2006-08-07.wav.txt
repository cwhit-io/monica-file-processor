[time=30] Hi, my name's Sam Barfell, and I have the privilege of serving as the superintendent
[time=44] of Black Hawk Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=48] Black Hawk Christian School has been in existence for just over 30 years, and I'd like to take this opportunity just to share some of the exciting things about what we get to do as a Christian school.
[time=57] First of all, we use a line around here that goes like this.
[time=61] We believe Black Hawk Christian School provides academic excellence on a biblical foundation, and there are two parts to that.
[time=66] The academic excellence is something that we pursue hard, and we have a rigorous curriculum that we challenge our students to give their very best and be the very best student that God's called them to be.
[time=77] But the other part of that is the biblical foundation.
[time=80] Everything that we teach comes from the truth of Scripture and the premise of everything we teach comes from that scriptural base, and that is what we call teaching truth.
[time=91] And then the other thing I'd like to tell you about is our faculty.
[time=94] We just have an incredible team of people who make up the teachers and the faculty, the staff of Black Hawk Christian School, and these people have given their professional lives and their ministry lives to serving the students that God has by his sovereignty placed right here in our school to provide that academic excellence on a biblical foundation.
[time=114] And it is my pleasure to work next and alongside those who are the faculty and staff of Black
[time=120] Hawk Christian School, they are second to none.
[time=122] I'm convinced of that.
[time=124] And I would like to just encourage you and challenge you during these summer months as you're thinking about next fall, school starting up again, to think about and explore the possibility
[time=133] of your child, your students becoming part of the family here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=139] And I would challenge you to give us a call and let us give you what we call a tour and a talk, walk through our facilities so you can catch kind of a heart glimpse of what we're about and what we're trying to accomplish and how we're trying to partner with parents who want their children to walk in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ.
[time=155] And how that and education are just seamlessly welded together in such a powerful way.
[time=161] And so I invite you to give us a call, get on our website and contact us and let us give
[time=169] you some more information about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=172] Thanks so much.
[time=173] We look forward to hearing from you.
[time=174] Was it in?
[time=178] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=190] and on earth." Therefore, go and make disciples of all new, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=208] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=212] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=218] the end of the age.
[time=223] Teaching seekers, find and follow Christ.
[time=230] To make a righteous treasure, how great the pain of searing lost, the Father turns his
[time=251] face away as wounds which Mother chosen one, bring many sons to glory.
[time=271] The old man upon a cross, I sinned upon his shoulders, a shamed I hear my mocking voice,
[time=295] all out among the snuffers, it was my sin that held him there, until it was accomplished,
[time=311] his dying breath has rocky life, I know that it is finished, I will not boast in anything,
[time=340] no gifts, no power, no wisdom, but I will boast in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection.
[time=357] I should have gained from his reward, I cannot give an answer, but this I know it all by
[time=372] heart, his wounds have made my ransom, I should have gained from his reward, I cannot give
[time=386] an answer, but this I know it all by heart, his wounds have made my ransom.
[time=403] Can we just sing that first verse again together, how deep the Father's love for us, how deep
[time=422] the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure, that he should give his only son
[time=439] to make a wretched treasure, how great the pain of searing lost, the Father turns his
[time=456] face away, has wounds which why the chosen one, bring many sons to glory.
[time=477] Good morning everyone, I just want to say a quick word of thanks, many of you have been
[time=486] asking how Paula and I are doing and our girls Hollis and Jillian and we are doing wonderfully,
[time=493] we are just so thrilled to be here, we are so thrilled and excited to be a part of this
[time=499] family and we just so appreciate your prayers, we thank you for your concern, we are transitioning
[time=506] well, I am very thankful to the staff and to Kelly, he has really just kind of and the
[time=512] staff has let us just kind of ease into things and it has been really good, especially with
[time=519] a two and a half year old and a ten month old, it just makes it a little bit easier, so thank you very much for your prayers and for your concerns and again, just hear me say we are so thankful to be here and it is a privilege for us and then I get to do this
[time=537] and so it is just a joy, so thank you.
[time=542] I am sure most of you are familiar with a phrase called authorial intent, the literature
[time=549] phrase and it really comes down to a question of meaning, what did the author mean, for
[time=555] instance let us just take the novel Moby Dick, Herman Melville, there is a debate within literature that would ask this question, is it more important to understand what Melville meant when he wrote that novel back in whenever it was or some might argue that it is more
[time=573] important for you, the reader, to come to your own meaning when you personally read it.
[time=581] The same thing is true within the biblical world, when you talk about the Bible, there is an ongoing debate and that debate rests on this same question, a question of meaning,
[time=593] is it more important to understand, let us take the book of Romans, for instance, is it more important to understand what Paul was meaning when he wrote the book of Romans or is it more important to understand what it means to me or to you right now when you
[time=610] read it.
[time=611] I would argue that it is vastly more important to understand what Paul meant when he wrote
[time=618] it back in the first century.
[time=623] But it even goes a little bit further than that because Paul I would say was the small case A author, there is a capital A author and that is God himself.
[time=637] So whether it is the book of Romans or whether it is 1 John or 2 Peter or whatever book it might be in the Bible, it is important for us and I think very helpful for us to understand
[time=648] that God is the author.
[time=653] When we speak about authorial intent, we need to understand that the author, yes, for the
[time=660] book of Romans it was Paul, but more than that, the author is God himself.
[time=665] So when we open our Bibles or on a Monday morning or Tuesday morning, whatever morning or evening it might be when you go to spend time with God, when you open your Bible, it is important to understand that it is God speaking to you.
[time=681] It is literally his grace coming into your life.
[time=687] That is the author part of it, but there is an intent part as well.
[time=691] Not only is God speaking to you and I try to literally picture, as I open up my Bible
[time=697] I try and picture the face of God just behind these words because that is really what is
[time=703] going on, God is speaking to us and then he has a purpose, it is intent.
[time=709] When you open your word and when you hear a message, God is wanting to make a claim
[time=715] upon your life.
[time=717] That is authorial intent, that is what we are really talking about when we talk about authorial intent in the Bible.
[time=724] So, whenever anybody stands up here to teach, the goal is to communicate God's claim on
[time=731] our lives.
[time=733] And that claim is an expression of God's grace to his people.
[time=742] I think that is helpful when we look at this, when we approach the Scriptures.
[time=746] That is really what is going on.
[time=748] So, with that in mind, let's look at Psalm 32 and we are going to read it.
[time=752] I am going to read it and you can follow along and let me say this again, if you want to stand and honor God's Word and if you believe that in your heart that that is going to honor God's Word, I would just invite you to stand.
[time=763] If you want to sit and honor God's Word while you sit, do that and again, like I said before when I was here a long time ago, the only important thing is don't look at your neighbor who is sitting and judge him and if you are sitting don't look at your person who is standing and judge that person, okay?
[time=776] So, however it works in your heart, let's do this.
[time=779] Psalm 32, how blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered, how blessed
[time=785] is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
[time=791] When I kept silent about my sin my body wasted away through my groaning all day long, for
[time=797] day and night by hand was heavy upon me, my vitality was drained away as with a fever heat of summer.
[time=804] I acknowledged my sin to thee and my iniquity I did not hide, I said I will confess my transgressions
[time=811] to the Lord and thou didst forgive the guilt of my sin.
[time=815] Therefore, let everyone who is Godly pray to thee in a time when thou mayst be found,
[time=822] surely in a flood of great waters they shall not reach him.
[time=825] Thou art my hiding place, thou dost preserve me from trouble, thou dost surround me with
[time=831] songs of deliverance.
[time=834] I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go, I will counsel you with my eye upon you.
[time=840] Do not be as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose trappings include bit and bridle to hold them in check, otherwise they will not come near to you.
[time=850] Verse 10, "Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but he who trusts in the Lord, loving kindness
[time=861] shall surround him.
[time=863] Be glad in the Lord and rejoice you righteous ones, and shout for joy all you who are upright
[time=872] in heart." Would you pray with me?
[time=878] God once again, I just want to communicate to you that I just can't believe that I get to do this.
[time=883] I can't believe that we get to be here and by your grace you've communicated truth to
[time=892] us, that is for our good.
[time=897] So Lord as we think about this psalm, God would you please, I desperately need your help to communicate your intent, or that is my desire.
[time=907] Lord may we be people who listen and seek to know your intent that we might live according to it.
[time=914] Thank you that you love us so much.
[time=917] We pray these things in Christ's name, amen.
[time=923] Thank you.
[time=924] Well, in order for us to feel the full impact of this truth, I need to press the rewind button.
[time=933] We need to rewind and I need to catch you up on the details which have led up to this psalm.
[time=939] If we had the time, we could go to the book of 2 Samuel, and if you wanted to break down the book of 2 Samuel, it's all about David's life.
[time=947] You could break it up into three sections, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[time=952] Chapters 1 through 10 are talking about the good.
[time=955] Then starting verse 11 and 12, it gets pretty bad.
[time=959] And then as you read the rest of that book of 2 Samuel, it gets ugly.
[time=964] So what I want to do here real quick is this, I want to look at that bad part, chapter 11.
[time=971] It's something that probably you're all familiar with.
[time=973] You just might not know that it's in 2 Samuel 11, but here's the situation.
[time=977] And it's going to be helpful to understand Psalm 32.
[time=981] David is king of Israel.
[time=983] Israel is at war.
[time=984] David chose not to go with Israel to war.
[time=988] Instead, he's walking up on the top of his house one day, and he looks down and he sees
[time=994] a woman named Bathsheba.
[time=997] He has Bathsheba come to his house.
[time=1000] They end up being physically intimate.
[time=1002] And then I don't know how much longer it took, but Bathsheba sends word back to David and says, listen, I'm with child, I'm pregnant.
[time=1010] So David, trying to cover his sin, to conceal his sin, comes up with a plan.
[time=1016] Bathsheba is married to a man named Uriah, the Hittite, who is a part of the army of Israel.
[time=1021] He's off at war.
[time=1022] He sends for Uriah to come home thinking that Uriah will spend some time with his wife, and that will cover it up.
[time=1030] There won't be a problem then.
[time=1032] But Uriah, because he's faithful to Israel, he says, I'm not going home.
[time=1036] I'm going to sleep outside the footsteps of your house, David, because I can't wait to get back to battle and fight for Israel.
[time=1043] So David just goes, oh gosh, what can I do now?
[time=1044] This guy's too faithful.
[time=1047] He sends him back to the front lines.
[time=1049] Along with that, he sends a message by Uriah's own hand to say to his commander, put Uriah
[time=1056] on the front lines and then retreat, hoping that Uriah would be killed.
[time=1064] And in fact Uriah is killed.
[time=1067] David covers his sin, conceals it.
[time=1070] But then in chapter 12, Nathan, the prophet comes and confronts David with the sin.
[time=1077] It might have been a year after, some long extended time.
[time=1082] David acknowledges his sin, he confesses his sin, and gets, you know, is forgiven of his
[time=1089] sin.
[time=1090] Psalm 51 is a record of that confession.
[time=1096] Says in Psalm 51, verse 10, you guys will, I think, be familiar with this, create in me a clean heart, oh God.
[time=1105] And renew a right spirit within me, cast me not away from your presence, oh Lord, take not thy Holy Spirit from me, restore unto me the joy of my salvation, and renew a right spirit within me.
[time=1117] And then you probably don't remember this verse.
[time=1118] But in verse 13, he says this, then I will teach transgressors your way.
[time=1127] Then I will turn sinners back to you.
[time=1135] So Psalm 32 is the fulfillment of Psalm 51, 13, does that make sense?
[time=1142] Here's this confession, Psalm 51, and in that confession he says I'm going to teach transgressors your way.
[time=1148] So Psalm 32 is that teaching to turn people back to God.
[time=1151] Does that make sense?
[time=1153] It's really cool.
[time=1154] So Psalm 32 is David's fulfillment of that, and in this Psalm he instructs sinners.
[time=1161] He instructs people like you and me about God's mercy.
[time=1165] He instructs us about our choices regarding trusting or not trusting God's way.
[time=1169] He instructs us about a life of blessing, about the joy of forgiveness.
[time=1176] But if I am going to communicate this in a way that I think would honor David's instruction as well as God's claim on our life and also be clear to you, I would say this, David is instructing us about a circle of safety.
[time=1193] Look at verse 10, it says this, "Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but he who trusts
[time=1202] in the Lord, loving kindness shall surround him." It's a circle of safety.
[time=1208] Circle comes in that word surround.
[time=1210] It literally means to encompass or in golf.
[time=1213] It's the idea of literally if you can picture like if we were superheroes today, if I were a superhero I'd have this force field around me that nothing could penetrate.
[time=1224] The safety comes in that word, loving kindness.
[time=1229] It is a Hebrew word called "hesad," and it's one of the most difficult words in Hebrew to translate to an English equivalent.
[time=1237] There's lots of different ways it's translated.
[time=1239] It's translated loving kindness, mercy, the word that I like or the phrase that I like is God's covenant faithfulness to his people.
[time=1250] God's covenant faithfulness to his people.
[time=1253] What that means is this, that God is for you.
[time=1257] God is in your camp.
[time=1258] He has made a covenant with you and he is going to keep his covenant.
[time=1262] He is going to be faithful to that covenant.
[time=1265] So as you unpack that idea of a circle of safety, man, we, those who trust in the Lord are going to be engulfed, encompassed with God's covenant faithfulness to us.
[time=1276] It's an awesome picture.
[time=1280] Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but he who trusts in the Lord, loving kindness shall surround him.
[time=1287] So please don't miss this.
[time=1289] This is huge.
[time=1291] This is God's grace being poured out into your life and into my life this morning.
[time=1296] In fact, it's being dumped out.
[time=1297] If you can picture a cement truck coming in.
[time=1300] Each of you have your own cement truck and it's beep, beep, beep, it's backing up right now, okay?
[time=1306] And the funnel is going to come right to you, right to your head.
[time=1309] And I want you to picture this instruction today as God's grace just being dumped out
[time=1315] into your life and into your heart.
[time=1317] That's what's going on.
[time=1320] This is truth.
[time=1321] This is what David wants us to know.
[time=1323] And here it is.
[time=1324] When we walk by faith in a trust relationship with God, we're safe.
[time=1331] We experience life blessing and protection, but when we choose to not trust the Lord acting
[time=1340] wickedly, we then experience great sorrow.
[time=1345] It's the circle of safety.
[time=1347] And as I think about it, really, the first thing that comes to my mind is a picture of a hamster inside one of those balls.
[time=1354] Anybody ever have a hamster here?
[time=1357] Thank you.
[time=1358] Lots of hamster people.
[time=1359] Good deal.
[time=1360] Do you have one of those balls where the hamster kind of went in there and then they kind of went all over, you know, and they were kind of safe inside that ball?
[time=1366] Yeah.
[time=1367] You guys know what I'm talking about?
[time=1369] The illustration breaks down because when the hamster is inside of the ball, that ball's not really big.
[time=1373] And so probably something could crush that ball.
[time=1375] But the idea is this, inside of that ball, they're free, they're safe.
[time=1381] There's not many troubles that they can get into.
[time=1383] All that's in there is themselves, the hamster.
[time=1386] When they get outside of that and kind of roam around the house, there's lots of dangers and toils and snares that they can get into.
[time=1393] So here's what I want you to do.
[time=1394] You can picture yourself, maybe paint your face as the head of a hamster.
[time=1402] There was somebody on there.
[time=1405] Inside that ball.
[time=1408] That's the circle of safety.
[time=1410] Okay?
[time=1411] Now, look at this.
[time=1412] There's a diagram to it.
[time=1413] That actually is a little bit better.
[time=1415] That's you.
[time=1416] If you're artistic or if you're not artistic, draw this circle for me and put yourself in there.
[time=1420] Draw your own face, if you would.
[time=1422] But here's the general concept of it.
[time=1424] There is this circus, circle encompassing you and inside that circle is safety.
[time=1430] And that safety is God's loving kindness.
[time=1432] It's His mercy.
[time=1433] It's life the way it was supposed to be experienced.
[time=1435] It's blessing, it's protection.
[time=1437] It's all of that.
[time=1438] But when you step outside of that circle and you do that, go ahead with the next one.
[time=1444] You do that by not trusting in God, whether that's disobedient sin, something you should have done that you didn't, basically you stopped trusting in God.
[time=1451] You step outside of that and there's sorrow.
[time=1457] You stay in it by trusting in God's promises, in His commands, in His truth.
[time=1463] That's what David is talking about in Psalm 32, verse 10, it's the big idea, the circle
[time=1473] of safety.
[time=1474] Let's look at this circle a little bit closer because I want you to make sure that you don't understand what's going on here.
[time=1481] This verse is not contrasting Christians and unbelievers.
[time=1487] This verse is all about people who are choosing to either trust God at any given point of their day or to not trust Him.
[time=1497] And the focus is primarily safety or sorrow in the here and now in the daily activities
[time=1504] of our lives.
[time=1507] Being the Lord, if we want to break that down a minute, it means this, it means obeying His commands and also thinking and knowing that His commands are not burdensome.
[time=1519] They're life-giving.
[time=1523] It means looking to Christ to satisfy the longings of your soul.
[time=1526] It means claiming His promises.
[time=1528] It means keeping His laws.
[time=1529] It means living daily in His ways.
[time=1533] Being wicked, again, it's not that you're not a Christian, it just means that you're not trusting the Lord.
[time=1539] It means that you think you know better than God what will bring you satisfaction and fulfillment in life.
[time=1546] It's when you follow your flesh and its evil desires.
[time=1548] It's thinking that God's laws and commands are burdensome.
[time=1552] And God's commands are old-fashioned, they're rigid, they're too constricting.
[time=1558] And nothing could be further from the truth.
[time=1562] And wicked means taking God's place as the leader of your life.
[time=1569] That's the circle of safety.
[time=1571] As I think about it, here's what it looks like on a practical basis.
[time=1574] It's not much different than the picture of a father with his child.
[time=1581] Some of you have met my daughter, Holla, she's about two and a half years old, and she's just getting to the point of being able to understand instruction and warning.
[time=1591] And it's really cool because I call her over and she looks at me and we're really working on eye contact and her listening and that kind of stuff.
[time=1597] And so she's looking up at me at these big brown eyes and I can just see these wheels in her mind, just starting to churn a little bit, okay?
[time=1606] And so I try really hard as a father to think ahead for her, okay?
[time=1615] Let me give you an example.
[time=1618] When we go somewhere, for instance, let's say we're at the park and she just loves life.
[time=1624] I mean, she just is going full steam ahead, 100%, tackling everything, seeing whatever
[time=1630] somebody else does she thinks she can do and she's going having a ball.
[time=1633] And so when we get ready to leave, here's what I try to do.
[time=1635] I'm trying to think ahead for her.
[time=1638] I call her over to me and again, look her in the eye, we're working on that eye contact thing.
[time=1643] We've got about five minutes left of playing and then what's going to happen at the end
[time=1650] of that five minutes is that Daddy's going to call you over and he's going to say it's time to go.
[time=1656] And what I want you to do at that point is say, okay, Daddy, I'm ready to go.
[time=1663] Instead of Hollis, whining and crying and really wanting to stay because you know what?
[time=1668] I tell her this, you're going to be, she might not understand this, you're going to be tempted to look around at all the other kids playing and whine and cry and say, can I please just stay a little bit longer?
[time=1681] Sometimes it works.
[time=1684] Sometimes it doesn't and she still cries and whines and says, I want no, I want to keep staying but here's what I'm trying to do.
[time=1693] I'm wanting to think ahead for her.
[time=1695] I'm wanting to prepare her for choices and consequences because right now really what's going to happen is either, you know, if she chooses to obey, man, she's going to get lots of praise, lots of encouragement from me.
[time=1708] If she chooses not to obey, she's going to experience some pain.
[time=1714] Now, at that level it's kind of small but as she continues to grow and as she continues
[time=1721] to get older and as I continue to try and think ahead for her, guess what, those consequences of her choices are going to become greater and greater.
[time=1730] I want her to learn to trust me that I have her good in mind so that when she gets older,
[time=1737] she's going to say, yes, daddy, I trust you, I'll go that way.
[time=1741] It's the same thing that David wants you to understand that God wants to father you and
[time=1749] parent you and he is showing you the way that is good and he knows when you're going to be tempted to say, I don't want to go that way, God, but he's telling you there's sorrow that way and there's life and praise and encouragement with me.
[time=1765] That's the picture of it.
[time=1769] So let me recap this thing real quick, this circle of safety.
[time=1772] You still see it on the screen.
[time=1774] At any given point in our day, we can venture outside of the circle.
[time=1779] We do this when we fail to trust God in a decision, in an action, in a thought, whatever it might be.
[time=1785] And when we do this, we open ourselves up to all kinds of trouble and sorrow, but we can
[time=1792] also at that point choose to stay inside the circle.
[time=1795] We do this when we trust God, when we believe what he says and when we act in obedience
[time=1801] to what he says.
[time=1803] And when we do this, we are surrounded, engulfed, encompassed by loving kindness, by his covenant
[time=1812] of faithfulness.
[time=1813] We get to experience more blessing, more satisfaction, more mercy, more life than we could ever imagine.
[time=1820] And you know, when you look at it, I think this is what God intended from the very beginning for us to experience life like that.
[time=1829] And as I look at that circle, I think why would we choose to venture outside of it?
[time=1836] That has so much good in store for us as we walk in his ways.
[time=1842] Well, in my remaining time, I want to explore this psalm with you a little bit further because
[time=1850] this circle of safety, David just unpacks this concept beautifully throughout the psalm.
[time=1855] And what I want to look at are three things.
[time=1857] One is just sorrow outside of the circle.
[time=1860] Secondly, then mercy inside of the circle, and we're also going to see that the mercy extends even when we go outside of the circle.
[time=1867] And then finally, I just want to finish with some points of application.
[time=1871] So first, sorrow outside of the circle.
[time=1874] There are four consequences of living outside of the circle in this psalm, in this context.
[time=1881] Number one is this comes in verse three.
[time=1885] There are physical consequences when we step outside of the circle and stop trusting God.
[time=1892] Verse three says this.
[time=1893] I kept silent about my sin.
[time=1897] My body wasted away through my groaning all day long.
[time=1903] This is a simple fact, but I think an often neglected one.
[time=1907] There are physical consequences to sin.
[time=1912] You know, David speaks in that verse of an atrophy.
[time=1915] Any of you ever broken your arm and had it in a cast for a long extended period of time?
[time=1921] On some part of your body, in a cast, some part of time?
[time=1924] Yeah.
[time=1925] What happens after the months that your cast is on when you take that cast off?
[time=1929] What do you see?
[time=1930] You see a smaller limb, right?
[time=1932] You see a smaller body part because what happens?
[time=1935] There is atrophy that takes place, literally your body wastes away.
[time=1938] This is what David is talking about when he steps outside of that, he has physical consequences.
[time=1943] His body is wasting away and he experiences pain, groaning all day long.
[time=1951] The first Corinthians 11, verse 30, it says this.
[time=1954] For this reason, some among you are weak and sick and a number sleep.
[time=1960] I take that sleep to mean basically physical death.
[time=1964] And the reason there is because of a sin issue in the verses previously that people would take communion in an unworthy manner.
[time=1971] Right there, it's saying.
[time=1972] Again, it's just building the case.
[time=1974] There are physical consequences to sin, to stepping outside of God's circle.
[time=1980] Think for a minute about this, in just one area of life, think about the myriad of diseases
[time=1986] that can come along with living outside of God's design for sex and marriage.
[time=1992] That's just one area of life and the consequences are great.
[time=1999] Well, there's a second consequence, it's an emotional consequence.
[time=2003] Verse 4, "For day and night your hand was heavy upon me, my vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer." I think this might be even further reaching than the physical consequences.
[time=2015] I think we all can relate to this.
[time=2017] David's vitality was literally drained away with this inner struggle of knowing and yet
[time=2024] not acknowledging his departure from the Lord.
[time=2028] Can any of you relate?
[time=2030] Think of it.
[time=2031] We know we've departed from God's good plan for our lives and yet we sometimes, we want to hold on to it.
[time=2037] We don't want to confess it, we don't want to acknowledge it, and man, the inner struggle that goes on.
[time=2044] The emotional drain, sometimes it just really becomes too much to bear.
[time=2048] There's mental anguish, there's sleepless nights.
[time=2052] Sometimes there's even just torn up stomachs as you think about what's going on and how you're trying to just grasp on to this sin that you're holding on to.
[time=2061] There's emotional consequence.
[time=2066] But there's more.
[time=2070] I wish, as I was thinking about this, I wish I could stop right there because if those were the only consequences, then I could understand that my sin only had an effect upon me, but
[time=2083] it goes a little bit more, and it doesn't come directly from Psalm 32, but it comes in the context that I told you about earlier, about David and Uriah the Hittite in Bathsheba.
[time=2092] Here's what happened.
[time=2093] There's a third consequence.
[time=2095] There are multi-generational effects.
[time=2100] Second Samuel, chapter 12, we're going to read this, starting in verse 9.
[time=2104] I want to show you this, this is amazing.
[time=2108] Why have you despised, this is Nathan the prophet talking to David.
[time=2111] Why have you despised the word of the Lord by doing evil in his sight?
[time=2116] You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.
[time=2124] Now therefore get this, the sword shall never depart from your house.
[time=2131] Because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife, thus says the Lord behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own household.
[time=2141] I will even take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight.
[time=2147] Indeed, you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and under the sun.
[time=2154] Man, there are multi-generational effects to the choices that we make here and now.
[time=2164] Oh man, I just, I wish, I wish that we could all just look down the quarter of time and
[time=2173] see the impact of stepping outside of the circle.
[time=2183] The phrase "the sword shall never depart from your house." If you could read through the Old Testament and just follow the genealogy of David and follow the lineage of his household, you will see there are wars and struggles and conflict
[time=2196] and bloodshed throughout all his generations.
[time=2204] I pray as I think about this, I pray that God would protect my children and their children
[time=2213] and the children that they have, that God would protect them from my foolish choices.
[time=2221] There are consequences in the decisions that I make for generations to come.
[time=2229] There's a final fourth consequence, and it's very similar to this.
[time=2233] It's that other people are affected in a direct way.
[time=2236] That multi-generation is kind of an indirect way, but here it is directly, and it's the following verses in 2 Samuel.
[time=2242] It says this, "Then David said to Nathan, 'I have sinned against the Lord, and Nathan said to David, 'The Lord also has taken away your sin.
[time=2250] You shall not die.'" However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.
[time=2261] So Nathan went to his house, and the Lord struck the child that Uriah's widow bore to David so that he was very sick.
[time=2269] David therefore inquired of God for the child, and David fasted and went and lay all night
[time=2275] on the ground.
[time=2276] The elders of his household stood beside him in order to raise him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them.
[time=2284] Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died.
[time=2290] I mean, just think about this for a minute.
[time=2294] I'm not saying that God is going to strike your child because of some sin in your life, but I want you to stop for a moment and just consider that endless path of sorrow that
[time=2307] can come from even one bad choice to step outside of the circle.
[time=2314] Think about David, that this child died.
[time=2319] What did that do to Bathsheba?
[time=2324] What did that do to the rest of the people in that house?
[time=2330] You know, I literally, as I was reading this passage there and as I was studying it this week, I literally wept for David, just thinking of those consequences from that foolish choice
[time=2345] on the rooftop one day.
[time=2351] And then I think, how much more should I weep for the consequences of my own foolish choices?
[time=2362] You know, I think what sorrows may lie ahead, what weeping may still need to come.
[time=2368] And yet, how gracious of God to communicate this truth to us, to say, you know what?
[time=2372] You don't need to go outside of the circle.
[time=2374] You can stay right in and be safe and experience life and blessing and protection.
[time=2381] Again, this is our Heavenly Father parenting us, thinking ahead for us, telling us, listen,
[time=2388] if you go that route, if you decide to choose that way, then sorrow will result.
[time=2395] But I have so much more if you would just listen and obey.
[time=2400] You know, before we go too far down this road of understanding the sorrow outside the circle,
[time=2407] I just want to remind you of God's grace.
[time=2411] Listen, you sang this song earlier, it's a line that I love.
[time=2420] I want you to hear it again.
[time=2421] I want you to believe it.
[time=2422] And then I want you to see this line sprinkled throughout this song, God's boundless love
[time=2432] conquered my boundless sin and mercy's arms were open wide.
[time=2441] It's true.
[time=2445] There's mercy inside the circle.
[time=2447] And even sometimes when we step outside of the circle, I want to show you four traces of God's loving kindness toward us in this song.
[time=2453] This is really good.
[time=2456] Number one, verses one and two, God in Christ covers and takes away our sin.
[time=2463] How blessed is He whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
[time=2467] How blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
[time=2474] Listen, God in Christ has taken away our sin, He's covered our sin and He's given us His imputed righteousness.
[time=2481] Then He allows us to be people of integrity even though we're not people of perfection.
[time=2487] God is so gracious in dealing with our sin.
[time=2493] This sin problem is the single biggest problem you and I will ever face.
[time=2496] It's the problem that we are sinners and left to ourselves, we have no way out.
[time=2503] You know when this whole human sin saga began in the Garden of Eden, when Adam and Eve failed to trust God, remember what happened?
[time=2513] God took an animal and slew it and made coverings for Adam and Eve.
[time=2519] They needed this because now that sin had entered the world, they were ashamed of their nakedness.
[time=2524] I really think that's a physical reminder of their new spiritual state.
[time=2530] And ever since this, we as humans have tried to cover ourselves emotionally, socially,
[time=2537] intellectually, spiritually, we don't really want people to be able to peer into our souls
[time=2544] and to see exactly who we are and really what we're like on the inside.
[time=2549] We hide from others, ashamed of who we really are but praise God, we don't have to hide
[time=2556] anymore because God didn't slay an animal for us to cover us.
[time=2566] But God slew his own son to make a covering for us.
[time=2573] The Bible talks about a robe of righteousness, you know that?
[time=2581] And that those who come to Christ who have placed their faith and trust in Christ have been clothed in that perfect robe of righteousness.
[time=2588] We don't have to hide ourselves anymore.
[time=2590] We can open ourselves because we've been clothed, covered by the sacrificial lamb.
[time=2600] And again, this is so great.
[time=2602] It's not based on anything that we have done but on the perfect righteousness of God granted
[time=2608] to us in Christ.
[time=2609] You know, no matter how much there is to weep about, there is much more to celebrate.
[time=2615] Our sin problem has been dealt with by the very one it offends.
[time=2619] This is the good news of the gospel.
[time=2624] There's a second trace of God's loving kindness, His covenant faithfulness.
[time=2628] It comes in verse 4.
[time=2630] It's this, God doesn't let you stay in your sin when you choose to go outside of the circle.
[time=2636] Verse 4 says this, "For day and night your hand was heavy upon me." God has not only dealt with this sin problem but He also cares for us when we choose it
[time=2647] over him.
[time=2649] Your hand was heavy upon me.
[time=2652] Spurgeon said this, he said, "God's finger can crush us." What must His hand be like?
[time=2658] It's kind of a neat picture, isn't it?
[time=2663] So this consistent, heavy hand at the outset sounds really punishing.
[time=2670] It sounds cruel, but as you kind of peel it back, as you start to uncover what's going on, you'll really find the hand of a loving, gracious God who's wanting and pushing us
[time=2683] back to Him inside the circle of safety.
[time=2688] God disciplines those He loves.
[time=2690] God loves us too much to allow us to stay in the mess.
[time=2694] There's a third trace of God's mercy of His loving kindness.
[time=2698] Verse 6 and 7, "God provides refuge and protects from trouble.
[time=2704] Therefore let everyone who has Godly prayed you in a time when you may be found surely in a flood of great waters they will not reach Him.
[time=2710] You are my hiding place.
[time=2711] You preserve me from trouble.
[time=2713] You surround me with songs of deliverance.
[time=2717] At first you'd think that these verses were a little bit redundant, kind of more of the same stuff, just talking about my sin being covered.
[time=2723] When you look at the flow, it really becomes really cool.
[time=2728] What David is speaking about.
[time=2731] Listen, inevitably there will be times when I and when you venture outside of the circle.
[time=2739] Our sin will be forgiven, our guilt will be carried away, but we still are left with
[time=2745] dealing with the daily consequences of those choices, right?
[time=2751] And what, if you're anything like me, these consequences can sometimes feel like a flood
[time=2757] of great waters.
[time=2760] They can be overbearing and they can make me feel like I'm all alone.
[time=2763] And what David is telling us is that when we step outside and are forced to deal with the consequences, God doesn't leave us there.
[time=2770] He is present, even outside of that, even when we're trying to deal with the consequences of our sinful choices.
[time=2776] He's there.
[time=2777] He's your hiding place.
[time=2779] He's your refuge.
[time=2780] He's going to surround you with songs of deliverance.
[time=2787] Waters will not overtake you as long as you look to Him.
[time=2790] I mean, are you kidding me?
[time=2793] Can we just trace back these first three traces?
[time=2797] God deals with our sin.
[time=2799] Man, that's covenant faithfulness, that's loving kindness.
[time=2802] He doesn't leave us in our sin even when we choose it over Him.
[time=2807] God's loving kindness has said His mercy.
[time=2812] And when we leave His circle, He also carries us through the consequences.
[time=2819] And yet there's more.
[time=2822] God trains us in the right way.
[time=2826] Verse 8 is the instruction.
[time=2827] He says, "I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go.
[time=2831] I will counsel you with my eye upon you." This is the final trace of God's loving kindness.
[time=2836] It's His patient instruction.
[time=2838] In 2 Timothy 3, 16, it tells us that all Scripture is God breathed.
[time=2842] Remember that authorial intent thing I'm talking about?
[time=2844] This is a great verse for that.
[time=2846] All Scripture is God breathed.
[time=2848] And it's useful for some things.
[time=2850] Two of those things are for training and righteousness.
[time=2852] And another thing is for correction.
[time=2855] For some of you this morning, this training and righteousness, this is training and righteousness.
[time=2861] You're inside the circle.
[time=2862] And what God is telling you is this.
[time=2864] You don't need to go outside the circle.
[time=2865] "I want to train you in right living.
[time=2868] You can experience all the satisfaction, the contentment, the fulfillment, the blessing, the peace, the life.
[time=2873] All of that can be experienced right here.
[time=2874] I want to warn you.
[time=2875] I want to tell you, you don't have to step outside of that." For some of us this morning, this is God correcting us.
[time=2887] Some of us right here and right now are presently living outside of the circle.
[time=2893] God is telling you and pleading with you, come back, acknowledge this sin, confess it and
[time=2900] live in my mercy.
[time=2902] I've covered your sin, I've dealt with it, I'm trying to bring you back and I'm going to help you through the consequences of it.
[time=2911] And now I'm going to continue to instruct you in the right way so that you don't have to venture out and just play a game and just kind of test things.
[time=2918] I'm going to communicate to you.
[time=2921] God has instructed us and continues to do this, pointing us in the right way, showing that which is good, teaching us the way of life.
[time=2927] He's graciously given us his word to guide and direct.
[time=2930] And then look at this, as if this is not enough, God gets even more personal.
[time=2935] It's not just that He's given us His word, but look, He says, "My eye will be upon you as I counsel you." God is not impersonal, sees you.
[time=2946] He's intimately acquainted with you.
[time=2949] He's watching you just as I look at that park and I see how it's just playing.
[time=2954] And I know what's coming.
[time=2955] Man, my eye is upon her with great, fatherly affection.
[time=2959] It's what God wants to do with you.
[time=2964] God's not left us to wonder which way to go.
[time=2966] He's a speaking God, a revealing God, and His instruction is for a good as a part of
[time=2972] His covenant faithfulness to us.
[time=2975] It's the circle of safety.
[time=2977] It's an awesome concept.
[time=2980] Well, before we go home today, there's a few things I want you to take.
[time=2990] There are some truths that I'd like you to believe.
[time=2994] And there's also some truths that I would like you to live.
[time=2997] Does that make sense?
[time=2999] Sometimes when we hear God's word, it's just kind of, there's things that we need to know and understand.
[time=3004] There's also some things that we need to do.
[time=3007] So I want to kind of do both of those things.
[time=3009] Number one is this, understanding the circle of safety, understanding God's grace to us.
[time=3017] Let's live daily in the good of the gospel.
[time=3022] If we had time, I'd point you to verse five.
[time=3025] It's where confession comes, where David says, "I will confess, I acknowledge my sin, I will confess it." God takes away the guilt of my sin.
[time=3034] I want you to understand this, confession leads to forgiveness.
[time=3039] Confession doesn't lead to condemnation.
[time=3043] We think that sometimes.
[time=3045] Romans 8-1 says this, "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ."
[time=3052] We don't have to hide anymore.
[time=3053] We don't have to fear God.
[time=3056] And listen, your right living doesn't make you a Christian or keep you a Christian.
[time=3061] A Christian is a sinner who loves the cross because it is there where sins are covered
[time=3067] and righteousness is granted.
[time=3069] Listen, the gospel isn't just for salvation, people coming to Christ.
[time=3076] The gospel is for our sanctification, people living in the good of Christ.
[time=3082] Man, let's live in the good of the gospel, these truths.
[time=3087] Secondly, heed the warning, the warning is in verse nine.
[time=3094] And what I would say is this, be proactive.
[time=3098] A lot of times we live as Christians just in this reactive world.
[time=3101] We go out and we struggle with sin and the culture and everything that comes on us and
[time=3107] we always talk about God's forgiveness and that's true and that's right and that's good.
[time=3111] But you know what, let's be proactive.
[time=3114] We don't need to leave the circle of safety.
[time=3117] His instruction is there.
[time=3119] Let's not be like the horse or the mule, right, that needs bit or bridle.
[time=3127] Let's understand, here it is, that little end of that phrase and this is what the psalmist says in another place, "Your nearness, oh God is my God."
[time=3137] Remember that?
[time=3140] But as it says here, don't be like the horse who needs the bit and the bridle so that they would come near.
[time=3149] The third thing, we can take home, rejoice.
[time=3152] Verse 11, oh look at these three words, be glad, rejoice, shout.
[time=3163] Notice this is the end, this is the culminating piece of the psalm.
[time=3166] What a wonderful end.
[time=3167] You know what, there needs to be a whole lot more of this inside these walls and also inside of a heart and not because the music is such a high quality and not because the sound system is cool or anything else but because of this, because your boundless love has conquered
[time=3186] my boundless sin and mercy's arms are open wide.
[time=3193] My heart is filled with a thousand songs proclaiming the glories of Calvary, rejoice.
[time=3203] Be glad, shout for joy.
[time=3208] And finally this, a fourth thing, be motivated in your living and thinking by the glories
[time=3217] of Calvary, by these truths.
[time=3219] What do I mean by that?
[time=3221] I mean this, it's so easy within Christian circles to get caught up in just moralistic
[time=3227] right living.
[time=3229] We choose to do what's right because we know it's right and it's morally acceptable.
[time=3235] It's good and there are times for that.
[time=3237] We need to choose that way but really what happens when we live life that way, it's a
[time=3245] sticky note.
[time=3246] If you guys ever left a message on a sticky note and put it on the wall to help you remind, help be reminded of something, after a couple days, what happens to that sticky note?
[time=3256] It loses its stickiness, right?
[time=3258] And it falls off the wall and it just floats down to the ground.
[time=3265] It's stepped on underneath your desk, forgotten.
[time=3271] That's what happens sometimes.
[time=3272] I think when we just try and do things because they're right instead of being motivated in
[time=3278] our daily living and in our thought life by the glories of Calvary, how much more of
[time=3285] a difference does that make?
[time=3286] I'm going to invite Corbin and the team to come up and we're going to sing this song,
[time=3292] "The Glories of Calvary" one more time and I just want you to bask in the grace of God and understand that this is God's grace to you today to live in the circle, to be motivated
[time=3305] in your daily life by the glories of Calvary.
[time=3335] I'm going to invite Corbin to come up and sing this song. I'm going to invite Corbin to the
[time=3350] end of the song, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time and I'll invite Corbin to come
[time=3376] up and sing this song, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary"
[time=3400] one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more
[time=3536] "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time,
[time=3555] "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time,
[time=3563] "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time,
[time=3573] "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time, "The Glories of Calvary" one more time,
