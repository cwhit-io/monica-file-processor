[time=88] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and as always, I am so thankful to get to be with you.
[time=94] This morning here for a few minutes, I want to tell you about the message that you're going to see today.
[time=100] It was our message from our time of worship together last Sunday, and it's Dr. Mitchell Cruz and myself.
[time=108] And I'll tell you what, it's one of the most fundamental, I think, one of the most important topics that you or I could ever give thought or time to.
[time=118] And it's this issue of taking our faith, our relationship with the Lord, and trying to figure out ways to integrate that faith into the every day of our life.
[time=129] And I think you're going to really be encouraged, and I think you're going to be really challenged.
[time=134] And I want to say, before you watch it, that as part of the message that Sunday, Mitchell was able to sit down with the governor of the state of Indiana, Mitch Daniels.
[time=147] So it was Mitch Cruz and Mitch Daniels, and through a video interview, which we were able to tape, we're going to be able to show you, and you're going to be able to hear this morning from the heart of our governor as it relates to him and his own faith.
[time=163] And the way he integrates that into the every day of his life, in government and leadership.
[time=168] I want to make sure that you hear me say this to you today, as grateful as I am for what Governor Daniels did as he sat down with us and taped this interview.
[time=178] This is not about Republican support or Democratic support.
[time=183] This is not a political thing you're about to see on the Bible Hour.
[time=187] This is, as Mitch mentions in the message, this is about Christ.
[time=192] And this is about an attempt on our part to better understand the scriptures of Psalm 145, and to bring this interview with Governor Daniels alongside that effort.
[time=203] And really bring to light the life-changing truth of God's Word and what it means to live in relationship with the Lord, each and every day in each and every circumstance.
[time=214] And I hope you'll be encouraged.
[time=216] I'm so thankful for the governor and what he was willing to do and so thankful for Mitch, Mitch Cruz, and his willingness to give leadership to this endeavor.
[time=225] I think you're going to enjoy the message, and we're so thankful that you've tuned in and so thankful for the relationship that God has given us with you.
[time=233] Hey, have a great week.
[time=235] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=238] [MUSIC - 47 seconds]
[time=289] One more time.
[time=290] We'll remember.
[time=293] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=410] Sing this next verse for time.
[time=413] [MUSIC - 76 seconds]
[time=496] Sing this next verse with Chris.
[time=498] [MUSIC - 166 seconds]
[time=676] [APPLAUSE]
[time=681] Amen. Amen.
[time=685] We praise you, God, this morning.
[time=687] We lift you high and exalt you.
[time=690] Your character is unchanging.
[time=693] Who you are will forever be.
[time=697] You are a faithful God.
[time=699] So we praise you this morning for your faithfulness in any and all circumstances.
[time=704] Just to be who you say you're going to be and to do the things that you say you're going to do.
[time=709] I really love you and praise you for that this morning.
[time=714] Let's sing that one more time.
[time=715] Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=718] [MUSIC - 51 seconds]
[time=777] I am so thankful.
[time=779] The last two weeks, the emails that I've received, the letters I've gotten, the hallway conversations that I've had about Josh Rang and his message two weeks ago.
[time=788] Sam Barfel and his message last week, which I caught on the Bible hour this morning.
[time=792] We are so blessed to have just gifted men who have a heart to communicate God's truth, and they do it so well.
[time=799] And I'm so thankful for those guys and so thankful for Mitch and Steve, our other teaching pastor, and just grateful to be able to today bring to you the final installment of our summer series that we've entitled "A Summer in the Psalms." And this morning, Mitchell is going to introduce to you our study from Psalm 145.
[time=820] Kelly, have you seen the new Motorola Qphone?
[time=826] The Motorola Qphone.
[time=828] A little sharp, snappy-looking, thin thing.
[time=831] It is awesome.
[time=832] Anybody here have it?
[time=833] Anybody have a Motorola Qphone on them right now?
[time=836] Do you got one on?
[time=837] Is it here right now, right?
[time=838] Does anybody else have it on right now?
[time=839] I hope you don't have it on.
[time=840] We didn't have it on.
[time=841] They shouldn't have it on, should they?
[time=843] But the most small thing is, when I saw the advertisements come out for that, I wanted it so badly.
[time=849] Because look how it just fits in your hands.
[time=851] It's really, really thin.
[time=853] It's a PDA, anaphone, and all wrapped up into one.
[time=857] So I could get rid of my iPad and get rid of my cell phone and have it all blended in one.
[time=862] So I went to Verizon to buy it.
[time=865] I even was on vacation running beside a guy on the treadmill, and I said, "Is that that new Q?" And he goes, "Yes, can I hold it?" He didn't answer me.
[time=873] I just took it.
[time=874] But anyway, I wanted this thing bad.
[time=876] So I go into Verizon and they're explaining everything to me.
[time=880] It's kind of complicated for me.
[time=882] And I literally got to the point where I thought, "Well, maybe." And then they told me this.
[time=890] You would have to be online 24/7.
[time=893] You pay $49 a month to be online so this can sync with your computer and your Outlook Express and all that stuff.
[time=902] 24/7 from wherever you are.
[time=904] I said, "Well, I'll just take it without that." And they said, "No, no, no.
[time=908] That's how it works." And I said, "Oh." And I left because I didn't want to be online 24/7 for two reasons.
[time=920] The cost and the lack of my competence to be able to work the stupid thing.
[time=928] And as I left that dawned on me, you know, we do the same thing with God.
[time=934] We were designed to be online with God 24/7.
[time=939] Yet we work offline and we limit God to an hour a week in a building with a certain group of people in a certain way.
[time=951] Yet God designed us to be online 24/7.
[time=956] And that's what we see in David's ultimate crown jewel praise prayer song.
[time=964] We know from the title a prayer song to God, Psalm 145.
[time=968] David, a man after God's own heart talks about being online with God 24/7.
[time=974] Well, as I was reading this again and again and again over the last several weeks, I had previously taught on the Lord's prayer.
[time=984] And it was after several weeks that I began to see this pattern with Psalm 145 to the Lord's prayer.
[time=991] So I got David, a man after God's own heart.
[time=994] And I got Jesus, God in the flesh with God's heart.
[time=997] And they're kind of saying the same thing, so this is pretty important.
[time=1001] To be online with God 24/7, Psalm 145 is an acrostic.
[time=1005] It means that each line begins with a letter in the Hebrew alphabet, all the letters.
[time=1011] And so in honor of that, I developed an acronym for today.
[time=1016] And it's how to be online with God 24/7 is to be a person who prays.
[time=1020] If you want to write it down, P-R-A-Y-S.
[time=1022] And we're going to unpack what each one of those means.
[time=1024] Be a person who prays, P-R-A-Y-S.
[time=1028] Paul said to pray continually, to pray continually.
[time=1032] And you know when we're online, I'm told, when we're online, things can be downloaded to us.
[time=1039] And then we upload things, right?
[time=1042] Well, I notice on each one of these letters of this acronym prays that those are our uploads, but first they were preceded by God's download.
[time=1051] And I'm going to tell you that on each one.
[time=1053] And then we kind of see in the Psalm that there are these emails that get broadcasted out to everybody else because of this upload of praise back to God.
[time=1062] Well, I started thinking about this.
[time=1064] David was the leader of the free world.
[time=1066] He was the leader of the greatest superpower of the world back then.
[time=1071] So I thought, man, this has got a lot to do with leadership.
[time=1073] To be online with God 24/7.
[time=1075] I was thinking about this and thinking about this.
[time=1077] And the leader of the free world was busy today, but God, I think, orchestrated and encountered Indianapolis with the governor.
[time=1085] And when Susan and I were working out, we were spending a couple of days in Indianapolis, and I saw that he walked in, and when we were done, I walked over a few machines from me, and there was Mitch Daniels, and we talked a little bit, connected a little bit, and then I said, "Hey, can I ask you a question?" And he goes, "Sure." Wait a minute.
[time=1103] Can you all see him going up to the governor?
[time=1106] Hey, Mitch! I'm Mitch!
[time=1109] He did say try not to do the honor, the name thing.
[time=1114] Right. Everybody asked me, did I talk to him about the bumper stickers?
[time=1117] "Ditch, Mitch." I didn't.
[time=1120] Okay, so anyway, I do walk up, and that's about the way it was, and we're laughing and stuff.
[time=1126] And then I said, "Hey, would you, either on stage or with a camera crew,
[time=1132] would you let me ask you these questions that I'm going to address today?" How to be online with God 24/7.
[time=1138] How you integrate your faith with what you're doing, and leading the state of Indiana.
[time=1142] He goes, "Sure." And he started laughing. I said, "Why are you laughing?" And he says, "I'm going to be in Auburn in two days from now.
[time=1147] Let's just do it then." He was dedicating the new fire training center.
[time=1150] And so I did.
[time=1151] So what we're going to do is show you an interview, point by point, as we go through these five things, to be a person who prays, to be online with God 24/7.
[time=1159] Caveat, this isn't a Republican thing, and this isn't a Democrat thing. This is a Christ thing.
[time=1165] Okay? Amen.
[time=1167] So let's open our Bible, turn to Psalm 145, and we're just going to get right at it, take it in a section at a time.
[time=1174] And to be online with God 24/7 is to be a person who prays.
[time=1178] P-R-A-Y-S.
[time=1179] And we're going to see a correlation with Jesus' words in the Lord's prayer.
[time=1184] So here we go.
[time=1185] Psalm 145, I'm going to read the first seven verses.
[time=1188] "I will exalt you, my God, the King.
[time=1191] I will praise your name forever and ever, every day.
[time=1196] I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever.
[time=1199] Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[time=1201] His greatness, no one can fathom.
[time=1204] One generation will commend your works to another.
[time=1206] They will tell of your mighty acts.
[time=1208] They will speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty, and I will meditate on your wonderful works.
[time=1216] They will tell of the power of your awesome works, and I will proclaim your great deeds.
[time=1221] They will celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully seeing your righteousness.
[time=1225] The first thing to be online with God 24/7, to be a person who prays P-R-A-Y-S, is to praise the homophone P-R-A-I-S-E.
[time=1235] So your P is praise God 24/7.
[time=1240] To praise God 24/7.
[time=1243] To praise God the most were people expected the least.
[time=1248] Jesus said in the Lord's prayer in the first line, "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name." I really think the download here for the presence of God on this first one, to praise God, is the person, if you want to write down this little sidebar, the person in the power of God.
[time=1267] God's person in power, the identity of who He is, and His power, the availability of His power, warrants that I praise Him, that I praise Him.
[time=1278] It's interesting that extol, I will exalt, I will extol the name of God, the identity of who He is, is this picture of lifting God up.
[time=1287] And then praise, I think it's blessed, it's Barack in Hebrew, blessed in the NASB, is this idea of kneeling.
[time=1295] I bless God by kneeling, so there's this picture of me on my knees lifting up the name of God with all of my heart, with my time, with my talent, with my treasures, 24/7.
[time=1304] That's the picture.
[time=1306] And He talks about the name of God.
[time=1308] Jesus said, "Howl would be your name?" That's the person or the identity of God, as for who He is.
[time=1313] And then David talks about His power, and I meditate in your power.
[time=1316] He uses the word power.
[time=1318] Well, our Father of Art and Heaven, howl would be your name?
[time=1321] Your name be kept holy, your identity is holy, it's totally other.
[time=1324] That's for the person of who you are.
[time=1325] But in Heaven, this is really interesting about the presence of God, why it warrants praise, and it's 24/7.
[time=1331] Heaven, who reign us in Greek, has three meanings.
[time=1334] One would be the stars in the sky.
[time=1336] Another one would be a place where we go when we die, but the third one is this.
[time=1340] It's the air in and around us, the air that's in and around us.
[time=1345] And so Jesus is saying, and I think David's saying the same thing.
[time=1349] God, our Father, who is as close as the air is in us and around us,
[time=1357] you're here.
[time=1359] Let your identity, the person of who you are, and the power of your, let that be kept holy, totally other.
[time=1367] And so it's interesting that David, out of these next, the psalmist, out of these next bunch of 145 through 150, the next six psalms, the word praise is in it, I'm sorry, 46 times.
[time=1378] 46 times, there's this idea of God is close and the person, the power of God, I'm going to kneel to bless him.
[time=1385] I'm going to lift up the identity of who he is, 24/7, and everything I say, think and do.
[time=1391] These psalms were sung every morning in the synagogues.
[time=1394] There's this idea that it's 24/7.
[time=1397] So I asked the governor this.
[time=1400] I said, have you ever thought about how you would praise God 24/7?
[time=1405] And this is what he said.
[time=1414] I've thought a lot about it, and mainly about how far short of that ideal I fall.
[time=1422] It's so easy to be captivated or allow your attention to be taken away
[time=1429] by lesser things.
[time=1431] The best thing can happen to me on a day like that is to encounter, let's say, a person of the cloth.
[time=1440] Because I always think to thank them for their service, which is I always tell them that yours is the more permanent work.
[time=1449] I'm just dealing in the temporary.
[time=1450] When I remember that, I'm honoring them.
[time=1452] I'm likely to honor God the rest of the day.
[time=1456] It's interesting.
[time=1457] You know, in our study of the psalms, we've talked about this phrase.
[time=1460] You've heard me several weeks ago talk to you specifically about praise, being a people who would be willing to praise him.
[time=1467] Remember verbally applauding him, making much of him with great passion and with great energy, the willingness on your part and mind, in whatever situation, in whatever place we might find ourselves to be a people who would be willing to say, even outwardly, "God, you are so good.
[time=1484] God, you are awesome.
[time=1486] God, you are so faithful.
[time=1487] God, there is no God like you to be a praising people." And Mitch said it really well, and I want to talk to you about this, the readiness on your part in mind to praise God the most where people expect it the least.
[time=1502] But before we talk just briefly about praising him the most, where people might expect it the least, I want to just encourage you to praise him the most, where people might expect it the most.
[time=1515] Where do you think people would expect us to praise God the most?
[time=1520] Where?
[time=1521] In what room?
[time=1523] Right here.
[time=1524] Now we know it can go beyond this room.
[time=1526] Amen?
[time=1527] But I just wonder sometimes, and I just want to encourage you again this morning, what a privilege we have to come into a place like this and be with a family like this and to have artists and musicians lead us into the very presence of God and it gives you and I the chance to, with a fully engaged heart in mind, make a joyful noise, to clap and to sing and to shout and to do
[time=1550] that with great energy and with great gratitude and with great passion.
[time=1557] And I just want to encourage each and every one of you no matter how you're wired, no matter how young or how old you might be.
[time=1565] No matter what your morning's been like, no matter what you've been through that week, I want to just encourage us to continue to be a people who with a great deal of love and gratitude come
[time=1576] into a place like this and we praise him.
[time=1579] We verbally with great energy make much of who he is.
[time=1584] Now on the flip side, in those places and at those times where they would expect at the least, you know what, you can come up with the example, you and I both know that there are times in your week, there are times in your days, there are situations you find yourself in at work, there are situations you find yourself in with the family, there are times when you're out and about, you're driving, there's times at school, there are all kinds of situations where somebody does something or says something to you and they shouldn't have and it brings great pain, great discomfort and in those times you and I need to be a people willing to praise.
[time=1621] I was at Target yesterday and I was really looking forward to it,
[time=1627] you know, at the outset it was like let's go do this.
[time=1630] I got Jake, Jake, starting kindergarten and I got Jake's sheet of all the things he needs, all the school supplies.
[time=1637] So Jake and I are walking through Target and what began as a really exciting adventure that I was really up for within 10 minutes, I mean can I tell you how many people were in Target trying to buy the same stinking eraser that I wanted?
[time=1654] And we had to get just the right kind of eraser and it had to be the right kind of pencil and it had to be the right kind of glue stick and I'm thinking who in the world made this list and then I remembered it was a friend of mine who made the list.
[time=1668] And I could just feel myself, I could feel the fuse getting shorter and shorter and shorter.
[time=1674] And you know what, I just am so thankful, something triggered in me and I just thought you know what, I mean there were moms, there were moms yanking arms out of sockets within feet of me and I just thought to myself you know what, praise, praise God for Jake, praise God I get to, praise God I
[time=1695] get to have a little boy who's going to school and he's so excited, his backpack's been packed for three weeks.
[time=1701] You know what I mean, praise God.
[time=1704] And I didn't yell that to everybody at Target but it was the state of my spirit and you and I can, we can make those choices, we can have that kind of mindset and God can be praised in those situations where they would expect it the least.
[time=1721] Praise God the most where people expect it the least in a business deal and a relationship and those closest to you and yes at Target.
[time=1729] The second thing, the R is renew, so write it down, renew.
[time=1735] Psalm 145 verses 8 through 13a, the Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.
[time=1743] The Lord is good to all, he has compassion on all he has made.
[time=1748] All you have made will praise you O Lord, your saints will extol you.
[time=1753] They will tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your mind so that all men may know of your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom, your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and your dominion endures through all generation.
[time=1768] Jesus in the Lord's prayer said your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=1775] It was understood that after God's kingdom came his will would be done on earth as in heaven and nearly every biblical scholar, nearly every church denomination agrees that when Christ came to earth he inaugurated God's kingdom in a mighty way.
[time=1791] He renewed his covenant in a mighty way and his will for your life can be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=1801] But you got to renew, you got to renew your mind.
[time=1807] Look who Paul wrote in Romans 12, Paul wrote in Romans 12.
[time=1811] Therefore I urge you brothers in view of God's mercy.
[time=1814] See I really think the download here that God does first is God's passion.
[time=1819] We see compassion a couple of times in this set of verses.
[time=1823] His passion, his love, his grace, his passion of his kingdom of love.
[time=1829] Kingdom is God's divine, rain, rule and order in the hearts and lives of people on this earth now and in the future.
[time=1843] Kingdom is the extension of one's will so they go together, kingdom and will.
[time=1847] Therefore I urge you brothers in view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices but don't crawl off the altar, please.
[time=1854] Holy and pleasing to God.
[time=1855] This is your 24/7 spiritual act of worship.
[time=1858] Verse two, do not conform, don't pretend any longer to be conformed to the pattern of this world but be transformed, be changed by what?
[time=1866] The renewing of your mind.
[time=1870] Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is.
[time=1877] This is good, pleasing and perfect will.
[time=1881] For by the grace, gracious God, given me, I say to every one of you, do not think of yourself more highly than you ought but rather think of yourself with sober judgment.
[time=1890] There's this idea of humility, this threat of humility through all five of these words.
[time=1895] Renew your mind.
[time=1898] So I ask the governor, how do you renew your mind 24/7?
[time=1906] What are you doing?
[time=1913] Well, it certainly includes the predictable things.
[time=1917] Billy Graham taught the start by reading the Bible, going to church and praying.
[time=1923] These three things I do.
[time=1926] And prayer always in the morning and at night, but on my best days in between too.
[time=1935] Sometimes something will bring it to mind.
[time=1938] News of hardship, perhaps someone who's lost a loved one.
[time=1945] But I try to discipline myself also to take at least a brief pause
[time=1951] before we make a big decision or before we make a hard choice.
[time=1958] See all that threat of humility comes there and was Jesus who said, Father, not my will, but yours.
[time=1965] We learned in Psalm 51-10 last week that David said he renews.
[time=1969] He says, Father, created me a pure heart.
[time=1971] Oh, God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[time=1975] And there's this humility that I thought I saw in the governor there as well about how you renew.
[time=1979] How you renew.
[time=1980] Jesus said I came to make all things new to renew.
[time=1983] It's a great phrase.
[time=1984] It is a great truth, my friends.
[time=1986] Think about it, to renew.
[time=1987] Something is old.
[time=1988] Something is tired.
[time=1990] Something is run down.
[time=1991] Something's broken.
[time=1992] Something's not right.
[time=1993] And it gets renewed.
[time=1995] And we know that God does that.
[time=1997] But again, He allows us the privilege of participating.
[time=2000] This renewing.
[time=2001] Anybody in the room ever made a commitment to renew your physical condition?
[time=2005] Let me see a hand.
[time=2006] Anybody in the room, let me see a hand.
[time=2008] If you've ever made a commitment, there you go, to renew your physical condition.
[time=2013] You were going to run so many times a week.
[time=2015] You were going to stop eating this.
[time=2017] Isn't it amazing?
[time=2019] I can speak for myself here.
[time=2021] Isn't it amazing how quickly we can make a commitment like that, to renew our physical condition?
[time=2028] And like that, two, three, four days later, we're just pounding
[time=2034] the Captain Crunch and not only in the morning, but at night.
[time=2039] And there's just cherry cokes all over your desk.
[time=2042] And what was a good idea on Monday, you ever been there?
[time=2045] Just like in two or three days, it's like gone.
[time=2048] And the commitment isn't sustained unless Tuesday you get up
[time=2054] and renew this thing again.
[time=2057] There is this constant need for you and I to be renewing physically.
[time=2063] I mean, it's incredible.
[time=2066] Spiritually.
[time=2068] Spiritually, my friends.
[time=2071] I'll just say this to you.
[time=2073] I'm amazed sometimes at how, you know, I don't mind saying this
[time=2081] because I think there's probably a lot of you in the room who probably experience the same thing.
[time=2084] So as always, we're in this together.
[time=2086] But the fact is, there are times I can feel personally, spiritually healthy.
[time=2091] I can be in a situation where I feel full of what's true and right and good.
[time=2096] I can come out of a meeting or I can come out of a weekend or we can come out of a season of ministry and I can feel in my heart of hearts this deep sense of connection with him.
[time=2109] And I'm capable of hours later.
[time=2115] I'm capable of minutes later, mentally.
[time=2120] I can find myself having slits, slits as far south as you can imagine.
[time=2127] I can be here one moment.
[time=2129] I can be I'm capable of being here the next thinking things.
[time=2134] I shouldn't think contemplating stuff.
[time=2137] I shouldn't contemplate.
[time=2141] And I've learned over the years.
[time=2143] And I'm still learning that, you know, the morning, you know, the early morning thing with him is really, really good.
[time=2149] It's really healthy, my friends, to go ahead and just get up before anyone else is and to read and to think and to ponder and to write and to sing and to meditate to hide God's truth in your heart.
[time=2161] He doesn't take a brain surgeon to crack open the scriptures and spend time with him listening to him and reading him and dwelling on what's healthy and true.
[time=2172] But I've learned that if that's all you and I do, if that is the extent
[time=2178] of our renewing of our minds spiritually.
[time=2183] And I'm oftentimes toast by lunch because the barrage, the barrage is constant.
[time=2191] The barrage is never ending.
[time=2195] The messages and the temptations and the attempts of the evil one to move your mind and mind in places they shouldn't go.
[time=2204] It never stops.
[time=2206] And so there has got to be a willingness and a readiness on your part in mind to renew our minds with the very life giving truth of the scriptures.
[time=2215] That's why I say to you all, you ought to have something in the car.
[time=2218] You ought not, you ought not to be listening to garbage.
[time=2223] You should be listening to what's true and right and good.
[time=2226] And if that sounds like a dad talking to you, sorry, but it's just the truth.
[time=2231] You ought to be filling your mind with what's true.
[time=2234] That's why you ought to have something in the car going on.
[time=2236] You ought to have something at the desk going on.
[time=2238] That's a reminder.
[time=2239] You ought to have something on your laptop.
[time=2240] You ought to have something at home that evening with the kids.
[time=2243] You ought to have something at night before you go to bed.
[time=2246] The stakes are that high and the barrage is that heavy.
[time=2249] You and I must be people who renew.
[time=2252] By God's grace and with His help, our spiritual minds day by day, hour by hour, I would say moment by moment.
[time=2260] Your kingdom come, your will be done, the renewal is a shift from making life all about the advancement of my kingdom and making it about the advancement of God's kingdom, His passion of love.
[time=2270] Paul said in St. Corinthians 10 5, "I take every thought captive and make it obedient to Christ." Well, how to be online with God 24/7, David, and I believe Jesus, they teach us to be a person who prays.
[time=2284] The first "P" is praise.
[time=2286] Praise God for His person, for His power.
[time=2289] Renew.
[time=2290] Renew my mind because of God's passion for His kingdom in my life.
[time=2296] And the third one is to ask.
[time=2297] I think the download that precedes this is God's provision.
[time=2300] Psalm 145, 13b, incidentally, which is in the NIV.
[time=2304] I don't think it's in the NASB because it's in some old text and it's not in others.
[time=2311] This is the Hebrew letter none.
[time=2313] Would have started this line.
[time=2314] That's why I believe that line was in there.
[time=2315] They were in the scrolls found at the caves at Qumran.
[time=2319] So this is very interesting, a little nuance there.
[time=2321] So I'm one 45.
[time=2322] You just had taken a shot at the NASB didn't you?
[time=2324] Oh, no, I like it.
[time=2325] Sorry.
[time=2326] NIV.
[time=2327] The Lord is faithful to all His promises and loving toward all He has made.
[time=2332] The Lord upholds all those who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.
[time=2337] The eyes of all look to you and you give them their food at the proper time.
[time=2342] You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.
[time=2346] Jesus said, "Give us today our daily bread." A picture of God providing manate to the Israelites wandering in the desert.
[time=2353] Jesus himself quoted Deuteronomy.
[time=2355] He said, "A man cannot live by bread alone, but only on the Word of God, only on this provision of God."
[time=2363] The download of God's provision is why I can upload and ask and live a life that asks God.
[time=2370] This is important here.
[time=2371] I want you to give this.
[time=2372] Ask God for the resources that I lack to advance His kingdom.
[time=2383] I've quit seeing myself as a package already done and see myself as a person in need who
[time=2389] needs to ask God for His provision to advance His kingdom in my life.
[time=2392] So I ask the governor, "What do you ask God for?"
[time=2401] Guidance, and little else.
[time=2404] I am very, very -- this is a matter I feel rather strongly about, that I am very, very
[time=2412] cautious to ask for anything, certainly for myself, occasionally for others.
[time=2418] But I believe, and I don't know if this is a Presbyterian upbringing I've had or a more general,
[time=2425] but I try to always remember that there's a plan that I can't know it.
[time=2432] I can only try to find my own place in it.
[time=2435] It will include a pain and hardship for me or for others that I care about.
[time=2440] But the God has a reason.
[time=2442] And so I very rarely pray for a result.
[time=2447] I do pray that His will be done, that I not stumble in trying to find and act out my
[time=2454] infinitesimal part in His will.
[time=2457] And I try to recognize that His plan may involve my failure.
[time=2462] It could be that through some mishap, some failure, something negative that happens to
[time=2468] me, others will learn or will see an error in their own ways.
[time=2475] And so I almost never, in fact, I'd say never pray for an outcome only that it be His outcome
[time=2486] and that I play my role appropriately.
[time=2490] I thought that was so insightful.
[time=2492] Isn't that interesting on how He asks for what He lacks to advance God's kingdom, not His own?
[time=2499] I would just encourage you to do this this morning.
[time=2501] If you've got a pen and I hope you've got something you can just write with, I would just encourage you to please write this down.
[time=2507] As we would try to be a people who would be prayers.
[time=2511] And in this part of asking, I would just hope that you would maybe be willing to come at
[time=2517] it this way.
[time=2518] Write this down.
[time=2519] This is what we would ask you today.
[time=2521] This is what we believe God is calling you to articulate.
[time=2524] Thy will, write this down.
[time=2526] Thy will be done.
[time=2528] Write that down.
[time=2529] Thy will be done.
[time=2531] That's the outcome we're hoping for.
[time=2533] That's what we're wanting to see God do.
[time=2536] Write down, thy will be done.
[time=2539] Now just write these three things underneath with my kids.
[time=2543] Write that down.
[time=2546] Are you willing to have that be your prayer?
[time=2548] Thy will.
[time=2549] God, whatever you would will for my kids, that's what I want to see you do.
[time=2554] And God, please, here you go.
[time=2555] God, please give me the courage.
[time=2557] And God, please give me the strength to not detract from your will being done.
[time=2562] My will being done with my kids, but only help and assist and compliment.
[time=2568] Thy will be done with my kids.
[time=2570] And oh, God, give me the strength to assist in that, not diminish in that.
[time=2576] Write this down.
[time=2577] Under thy will be done.
[time=2578] Next, write in my marriage.
[time=2584] And pray as you write that one down.
[time=2586] Pray and have a willingness to say, "God, please give me the strength and courage to assist, to help, to further your work in the life of my spouse, to further what you want
[time=2598] done, thy will be done in our marriage." God, I want to do anything and everything I can to help that come to fruition.
[time=2604] I don't want to diminish your work in my marriage.
[time=2609] And whatever I might need to see, whatever I might need to do, whatever I might need to say, "Oh God, give me the strength and courage to do so." Thy will be done.
[time=2618] That's what I want, because your will, God, is better than mine.
[time=2623] Thy will be done.
[time=2625] Thirdly, write down in the office, in the marketplace, out on the job.
[time=2631] Wherever it is, you spend your days.
[time=2635] Are you willing to say to God, "Oh God, please have your will be done." And in that cubicle, in that office, out on that job with those guys or gals, in that
[time=2646] plant, wherever you spend your days, is there a willingness to say, "Oh God, give me the
[time=2652] strength and courage to assist in what you would want to do there." And to help further what you would be about there, not diminish it, "Oh God, give me the courage to do that very thing." Asking God for the missing resources to advance His Kingdom.
[time=2668] The prayer, Prosuki and Greek, is my heart connected with God.
[time=2672] It's online with God. And then asking these petitions and requests, that's a subset that happens within the context of my heart being online with God's.
[time=2682] So the asking comes after my heart being online with God 24/7.
[time=2689] How do you be a person who's online with God 24/7?
[time=2692] You're a person who prays.
[time=2693] You praise P-R-A-I-S-E, God for His person, for His power.
[time=2697] You renew your mind 24/7.
[time=2702] You ask God 24/7 for the resources that you need because of God's provision.
[time=2709] We renew our minds to be God's passion for His Kingdom.
[time=2712] And then why the fourth one is yield.
[time=2715] Yield, write it down, yield, like a yield sign.
[time=2717] I let go.
[time=2720] And that's because of what God has downloaded first.
[time=2723] God has downloaded first His peace, His peace, His forgiveness.
[time=2728] Look at what David writes in Psalm 145/17.
[time=2731] Psalm 145/17, the Lord is righteous in all His ways.
[time=2736] And loving toward all He has made.
[time=2739] Jesus said, "Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debt tours." C.S. Lewis says the two-letter word as there, as is the most sobering two-letter word in all of Scripture because we're actually praying that God would forgive us with the same liberality or same conservatism that we actually forgive other people.
[time=2758] We're actually praying that however we forgive other people, that's the way we want God to forgive us.
[time=2764] I've been praying this every night for several months.
[time=2768] And I realize the power of letting go.
[time=2772] Of letting go because it just frees me.
[time=2775] And you might say, "What's forgiveness got to do with righteousness and love?" Well, forgiveness weds together, it welds together, and weds together.
[time=2783] Two ideas, justice and mercy come together in forgiveness.
[time=2787] Justice is a cousin of righteous.
[time=2789] The Lord is righteous in all His ways.
[time=2791] Mercy is love.
[time=2792] And loving toward all He has made.
[time=2794] There's this peace that can only be found in Christ with God.
[time=2798] And then I have that peace.
[time=2800] And when I, through His power, just let go, just let go.
[time=2804] And I yield.
[time=2805] That's what a yield sign means.
[time=2806] I just let go.
[time=2808] And I pray that God would forgive me in the same way.
[time=2813] I forgive others.
[time=2814] Well, as you can imagine, in government and in politics, you have opportunities to yield and to forgive.
[time=2821] So I ask Him, "How do you yield 24/7?"
[time=2831] I do believe that humility is in some ways the first Christian instruction.
[time=2836] And I think that it is what, to me, it says that this is the true path.
[time=2843] The only God I can imagine would want us to be humble with each other and before Him.
[time=2850] And I think to me that's sort of the bedrock of the Christian faith and the center of it.
[time=2856] That I don't fall short of this on far too many occasions as we all do.
[time=2862] But on my best days and my best moments, I remember that not my will,
[time=2868] but I'm going to be dinnering.
[time=2870] And I think I have learned to be.
[time=2876] Maybe by watching others who are further down the path than I am.
[time=2881] I've learned to be more accepting.
[time=2884] Usually, it may not be my first instinct to forgive, but by now in life,
[time=2890] I think is usually my second or third instinct.
[time=2892] I catch myself and I can usually recover my balance.
[time=2897] Remember that a whole lot worse things can happen than somebody says something cruel or unfair about you.
[time=2902] The Psalms are full of moments in which the Psalmist asks God to save Him,
[time=2912] deliver Him from those who would tell lies, those who would persecute Him.
[time=2916] Notice he doesn't do it himself, he recognizes that that is for God to do.
[time=2922] There's his answer to the ditch Mitch Bumper sticker.
[time=2927] You know, it's amazing to me in the years that God's given me to do what I get to do with my days.
[time=2937] In the opportunities He gives me to be with what I do basically is I get to be around people a lot.
[time=2945] And over the years, it's incredible to just kind of as I've gone down this road, you learn people.
[time=2954] And maybe God gives you a discernment gift and maybe you gain a little insight as the years go by.
[time=2961] But today I'll tell you one of the things that breaks my heart more than anything is when I see people,
[time=2968] when I encounter people, when I'm around people who are just utterly shackled by the bitterness of unforgiveness.
[time=2981] It's gotten to the point where I can just, you can just sense it in them.
[time=2987] You can just, I can just see it, I can feel it, I can sense it.
[time=2992] They're just angry.
[time=2995] And sometimes they work really, really hard to not be and to not show it, but they just are.
[time=3000] And I just, on the opposite side of that, there isn't anything I think I enjoy more than being around people who are free.
[time=3009] Because you know what my friends, the fact of the matter is we've all, we have all been, we are all going to be.
[time=3015] There's no escaping the sinful brutality of other humans.
[time=3021] It just happens. It's just always going to happen.
[time=3025] Somebody's going to leave you. You know, when you were young, somebody's going to mistreat you in your marriage.
[time=3031] Some leader's going to abuse your trust.
[time=3035] Somebody's going to say things about you at school.
[time=3038] Somebody's going to do the unspeakable. And there is hurt to be had everywhere.
[time=3046] And I just want to encourage you, each and every one of you, and I mean that, each and every one of you,
[time=3052] Mitch, myself, every one of us has to deal with this on a daily basis to be a people who are willing to yield.
[time=3062] To say, "You know what, I'm just going to have to give this up." Because if I hold on to this for a moment,
[time=3069] I could end up holding on to it for an hour. And if I hold on to it for an hour, I could end up holding on to it all day.
[time=3074] And if I hold on to this all day, I could end up holding on to this for a couple months.
[time=3079] You understand what I'm saying? And that's not who you want to be, and that's not how God designed us to function.
[time=3085] And I'm learning this with you, and I just want to encourage you. I had a phone call last week, just an ongoing update
[time=3094] from me to you on this one. Most of you know my story, and I'm so thankful it's not done.
[time=3099] But I had a dad who left my mom and I. It was 17 years of adultery and a divorce, and he left my mom and I,
[time=3109] and he got married to the gal he'd had the relationship with, and I lost about a decade with my dad.
[time=3117] Lost it. Because I decided to be judge in Jewry, and I decided to not only hang on to it, but hang on to it tightly.
[time=3125] And I lost ten years. And God's grace and His goodness and the encouragement of others led my dad and I to a point ten years ago
[time=3134] now about where the relationship was renewed and there began to grow a friendship I never thought we could have.
[time=3140] And it is today a growing relationship that I'm extremely thankful for.
[time=3144] And last week we talked on the phone about maybe spending part of Christmas together for the first time in 20 years.
[time=3155] So you got a story. I got a story. People are dinging you left and right every single day.
[time=3162] And my friends, we've got to be a people who will continue to let it go.
[time=3169] Well, we need to be online with God 24/7. That's what we're designed to be.
[time=3173] And that happens through prayer. Prayer is being online with God, and it's being a person who prays.
[time=3177] That we praise God for His person, for His power, that we renew our minds.
[time=3184] 24/7, for God's passion, His kingdom, and our lives, that we would ask for God's provision.
[time=3189] That's the download first that we would yield because of God's peace.
[time=3192] And then finally the final one is surrender to be spirit led.
[time=3196] Write that down to surrender to be spirit led. David says it this way.
[time=3200] The Lord is near to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth.
[time=3207] He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him. He hears their cry and saves them.
[time=3211] The Lord watches over all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy.
[time=3216] And this last verse is kind of like, "For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for every man." My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord. Let every creature praise His holy name forever and ever.
[time=3225] I think the download that comes first here is God's protection.
[time=3229] Because of God's protection, I surrender to be spirit led when I'm tempted.
[time=3233] Jesus said, "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one." A lot of people have asked me, "Well, it sounds like God might lead us into temptation." No, in the Aramaic structure it really indicates that it's saying, "Let us not sin when tempted, rather than let us not be tempted."
[time=3249] "Let us not sin when tempted, rather than let us not be tempted." So I asked the governor, "How do you surrender to be spirit led?"
[time=3262] Well, I simply try to quiet my first myself and then my mind and wait to see.
[time=3272] And I can't say that it happens on every occasion, but on many occasions.
[time=3276] And especially if I've done a little bit of reading in the book beforehand,
[time=3283] since first of Serenity and Some Peace can come to me, a realization that the step I'm contemplating taking,
[time=3291] whatever the risks or downsides I'm worrying about are not so important really in the grand scheme.
[time=3298] And when I reach that point, I generally am able with a calm mind to surrender to what I perceive to be the Lord's will.
[time=3312] And again, recognizing that it may work out well or not well from my personal standpoint, but that's not the test at all.
[time=3322] So would you be a people who would surrender to be spirit led when tempted, realizing that God always provides a way out?
[time=3329] And his spirit is there.
[time=3331] You know, I saw this humility go through the governor and all these five things.
[time=3336] I think that word came out or a synonym of that word continued to come out in the dawn of me.
[time=3342] You know, the Christ is humble in heart.
[time=3345] And David was a man after God's own heart.
[time=3347] And so there's this heart of a leader that's really the heart of a servant that influences other people.
[time=3353] And there's great power in that.
[time=3355] And to be online with God 24/7 is how we were designed.
[time=3359] When the governor got done, he said, Mitch, I'd have to say some of those questions I've never really thought of before.
[time=3368] Those are powerful questions.
[time=3370] He said, my alma mater used to be a Christian institution and now it's really not, it's Princeton.
[time=3377] And he said, I had a professor there send me an invitation to come talk about how I integrate my faith and decision making.
[time=3384] I threw it in a drawer.
[time=3386] He said, after this interview, I think I'm going to get that out, run it by somebody like you, and go do that.
[time=3395] A person who's online 24/7 with God can accomplish great things because it's Christ accomplishing those things through that person.
[time=3403] You know, I didn't buy the Motorola Qphone because of the cost and because I didn't think I was competent.
[time=3408] It's interesting that Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 6, 19, and 20 that you and I were bought for a world record price.
[time=3416] The cost has been paid.
[time=3418] It talks about the spirit of Christ available to us now 24/7.
[time=3422] That's how it was designed.
[time=3424] And Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 3, 5, that our competence comes from God and it's the spirit of Christ and the spirit of God.
[time=3431] His Holy Spirit that's available in me to allow that wireless connection to happen 24/7.
[time=3437] So why rob myself and others around me of that blessing?
[time=3441] It cost has been paid and the competence comes from the same source.
[time=3445] So stand and let me pray for you as we go and try to live this.
[time=3450] And God, may it be so, may we be a people who are online with you 24/7.
[time=3456] God, that each one of us would be a person who prays that we would praise you or your person and your power.
[time=3462] That was came to us first.
[time=3464] That we would renew our minds.
[time=3466] We'd ask you to renew our minds to have your passion that came to us first for your kingdom advancement.
[time=3472] God, that we would ask you for your provision.
[time=3475] Your provision came before we ever had the opportunity to ask.
[time=3478] God, that we would yield because of your peace downloaded to us.
[time=3482] God, that we upload, we would just yield and we would forgive and we'd let go and not hang on to junk.
[time=3488] And God, that we because, because of your protection, that we would surrender to be spirit land.
[time=3498] God, I'm reminded the brother Lawrence called all this practicing the presence of God.
[time=3503] May it be so with us, God, may we be online 24/7 with you and may you change the world.
[time=3507] Because of it, may we be each a person who prays in Jesus name.
[time=3512] [AMEN]
