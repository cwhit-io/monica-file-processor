[time=296] My very present love, my very present love, my very present love, my very present love, my very present love.
[time=324] Hey, we're back again, and I'm so thankful for the opportunity that we have here.
[time=330] Many of you who have watched the broadcast in the past know that at Black Hawk, we are so very thankful for what God has us doing here and in this community.
[time=339] We love our family here, but you know what, we love really in a greater way, the church and not the building, but the people, the Church of Fort Wayne.
[time=348] There are so many churches in this community led by wonderful people who have a huge heart for what God is doing and wants to do in this community.
[time=357] And so we just have felt like for quite a while now that it might be a real nice thing for us to do everything we can to come alongside, support, and encourage those efforts.
[time=369] And so periodically we get a chance to have folks come on the Bible Hour, and today I am so thankful to have my buddy Dan Chipwood.
[time=377] Dan is the pastor at Crossbridge Community Church, and we're so thankful for the Crossbridge story.
[time=384] God has been doing some amazing things with that place and those people, and we couldn't think of anything we'd rather do, than to just get the word out again.
[time=393] Dan and the team have come by and done this before, but we continue to be so encouraged with what God's doing, and we want you in the community to know about Crossbridge.
[time=404] You may live close to where they are, and I'll have him tell you where that is these days, it's changed since he was last here.
[time=410] You may have some friends or family that live close to where Crossbridge is located.
[time=415] It is a great place, and God is doing some amazing things there, and we want you to know about it.
[time=420] So Dan, good to see you.
[time=421] Hey, thanks for having us.
[time=423] Absolutely, good to have you here.
[time=424] Tell the folks, if you will, just tell them about what God's been doing.
[time=429] Tell them about your change of location, and give people who didn't get to see you last time.
[time=435] Give people kind of a heartbeat, what Crossbridge is about, and I know you brought some guys, and you're going to share their story, so we'll get to them, but tell the people a little bit about what's going on there.
[time=446] Yeah, well since we were here last time, we actually, some real neat changes.
[time=451] We're a portable church, which means we don't have a permanent campus right now.
[time=455] We have bought land out on the corner of Hirsch Road in I-69 in the process of the building process, and all that entails.
[time=464] But in the meantime, right now we're meeting at the Branch YMCA, over off of DuPont and Dawson's Creek.
[time=472] And that's one of the changes since we were here last time.
[time=475] That's been a great partnership with us and the YMCA to be able to rent some space there, and have some similar mission that they're an organization that
[time=484] has a Christian foundation that really wants to make a difference in families and kids and people's lives, and it really connected with the mission of Crossbridge to do just that as well.
[time=494] And so that's been a great partnership for us, and it moves us out a little bit closer to the area that our permanent campus will be in someday.
[time=504] When he asked me, "What is the heart of Crossbridge?" I was recently talked to another pastor, and he said, "Dan, I think the age of the church, the time of what people are looking for in a relationship with God, in a relationship with a church, getting connected to churches, they're kind of asking the question of, "So what? What's going to impact me? What difference is it going to make in my life if I am following God, if I'm not following God, if I'm connected in a local church?
[time=533] Or if I'm not connected?" And so every time we, you know, every service we have, every day our staff gets up, we're trying to answer that question for people of, "So what? What difference can God actually make in your life? What difference will it make in your life to be connected into what we call a community of people that are journeying towards God?"
[time=557] And what we found is the average Crossbridge really looks like the person who is saying, "I'm really looking for God to make an authentic and a real difference in my life." And when that happens, those people turn around and they want God to make a difference in other people's lives.
[time=573] So we find a lot of the people end up landing at Crossbridge have been invited by somebody. God has made a difference in their life and they're so excited. I think about, when I get excited about something in my life, a couple years ago I took up running and I have a special pair of running shoes that I wear.
[time=591] And I love them so much that I tell everybody that gets into running, "Hey, you gotta buy this kind of shoe." And I found that that's the way it is with God. And the same way it is with people finding a church is when they really get dialed into God, and God starts really transforming their life.
[time=609] They want others to experience that as well. And the same thing with getting connected into a church. And so Crossbridge really strives to help people have their lives transformed by God and then let God use them to transform other people's lives.
[time=626] That's awesome. That's cool. You guys have been, as a church, you've been pursuing this mission for how long now? When did Crossbridge begin? About four years ago, August of 2002 is when we became Crossbridge and said, "Let's kind of change the way we do church. Let's be relevant in our community. Let's be practical to people."
[time=646] I started thinking about why people come to Crossbridge and why they tell us they do. There's no one thing. You hear people. It's because we love the small groups that we can be involved in. Getting connected to a group of people that we can do life deeply connected to.
[time=664] People say it's because of our children's ministry. We have a great children's ministry that points kids towards Jesus being there forever for us. There's a youth ministry that teens are involved in are helping young people learn how to follow Jesus.
[time=678] And they say, "Oh, it's the music. We love the music on Sunday mornings and the teaching. It's just really practical. It's genuine." It's probably a huge bunch that say it's the preaching. Not as many as I mentioned here, but there's a couple.
[time=691] I understand. It's a great team that you've got. It really is. That's good to hear. Tell the folks real quick what times?
[time=697] We meet at Sunday mornings at 9.30 and again at the YMCA or Voraf of Dupont in Dawson's Creek.
[time=704] Wow, who'd have thought church at the YMCA? Sounds like a lot of fun and I hope you all will give that some thought and maybe go check them out.
[time=713] I know Dan brought a couple of guys from his team from the family there at Crossbridge and we want to make sure that you hear from them as well.
[time=720] So Dan, thanks again for coming and we can't wait to hear these stories of life change as God continues to work in the Crossbridge community family.
[time=729] Over the last two years, I was really kind of in a place where I was struggling in my life and I'm looking for some purpose and God really stirred in me and made a lot of changes from the inside out in a huge way.
[time=744] When I first started going to Crossbridge, I was the guy that sat in the back row and got there late and laughed as soon as it was over.
[time=752] I didn't really talk to anyone to where then after just meeting some people and really finding out how genuine everyone is and just that they have a really, they just really want to help you with whatever you're going on in life.
[time=768] And so I slowly joined a small group and just really really liked the people there and just it's good to be able to talk about things that are going on in life, the same struggles, ups and downs.
[time=780] And from there I met the woman who I'm about to marry in a few months which I just know is just a direct straight God thing and just so blessed there and just couldn't be any happier with that.
[time=794] And then from sitting in the back row now I have in the last few months played guitar in the worship team and it's just nice to have an outlet to be able to share my story and hopefully help people that were in my shoes a couple of years ago and to be able to just keep on pushing forward
[time=814] and growing and as the church does along with everyone else. We had left our church and was looking for a new church someplace to worship and we had looked for months and people would come up to me and ask, "Well what exactly are you looking for?" and I always told them that, "Well I really can't explain it but when I see it I'll know it."
[time=835] And it was really a strange happening. I was on Wednesday and for my new job I was actually researching churches and Crossbridge came across my computer and so I was reading the staff bios and some of the things that the Crossbridge did for and what they were trying to accomplish and I called my wife up Barb at work and said,
[time=851] "Hey I think I found us a new church." And she said, "Well where'd you find it?" and I said, "On the internet." So that raised some eyebrows but we went that next Sunday and attended Crossbridge and have never turned back.
[time=861] The thing that impressed us so much was the heart of the people there from staff to leadership to even the people. There was just a difference there and when we hit it we knew it. We felt it. We said, "This is going to be a place."
[time=872] And the thing that I appreciate so much about the church there is that it doesn't matter what kind of baggage you come in with, wherever you are in your journey to finding God, whether you're far away from God or whether you've been walking that path for many, many, many years.
[time=888] They meet you there and there's no, it's not a complicated process about where you are on that journey and you fit in at those places.
[time=898] So it's just been a great fit for us and it's an easy place that no matter where we run into, somebody in a restaurant, somebody, a friend, family, wherever it is, we can invite them there because we know how they're going to be taken care of and how they're going to be loved there.
[time=911] And I think that's what the church is about. It's not just about a checklist of marking something off on a Sunday morning. It's about a 24/7 lifestyle and we've just been loving it there.
[time=921] Hey, somebody asked me and I got to start with this. This is, we're going to get to a passage this morning that I'm so looking forward to jumping into with you.
[time=931] But I want to just share some things with you from my heart. And when I say from my heart, I'm saying it because I don't want you to, this is not extended announcements here.
[time=941] All right, we're starting. This is really, really important to me that you hear this.
[time=950] And it's really important to me that you would, I hope, share in the excitement and the encouragement that these things bring to my own heart and soul.
[time=961] Somebody asked me recently, "What are you encouraged about?" As you face, all that you face there at Black Hawk, as you head into a new ministry season, what are you encouraged by?
[time=973] What excites your heart and soul? And I had a chance to think that through and I had a chance to answer the question.
[time=979] And as you would know, me, you know the answer was about 37 bullet points long. And I'm not going to take you through all 37, but I just, I had to share with you this morning.
[time=989] Some of the things that God's doing in my own heart and life and some of the things I see God doing here and some of the things that I'm so encouraged by.
[time=998] I want you to share in that encouragement with me. Let me just start by saying this. If you want to know what I'm encouraged by these days, I'm going to start with this.
[time=1007] I am so very thankful for, and I think you should be too. I am so thankful for a, I'm thankful for all of you. You know I love you. There is a segment of you that I am really, really grateful for.
[time=1023] And that segment would be a group of people that I just call our senior adults.
[time=1029] My friends, we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, as it says in Hebrews 12, a bunch of people who have seen a lot of life.
[time=1039] And at a time in life, listen, at a time and place in life when most senior adults, I'm going to take a few off here, okay, by saying I'm talking about like 55, you know, the 55-year-olds want me to say 60, and the 60-year-olds want me to say 65.
[time=1058] And if I had you stand, the 50s wouldn't stand. And so anyway, I'm talking about like 55, and it's kind of funny because I got friends now that are really close to 55, which means I guess I'm getting older too, right?
[time=1072] 55 and overs. I'm just kind of drawing the line right there. At a time when so many of them are getting more and more critical, at a time in life when so many of them seem to get more and more complaining, at a time in life when so many of them seem to get more and more complaining,
[time=1087] at a time in life when so many senior adults seem to just get more and more cranky, we are surrounded by, I am surrounded by here, a group of senior adults that have been nothing but supportive and grateful.
[time=1101] They have continued to bend, they have continued to flex, they have continued to set aside preferences all the while continuing to invest in this place, come alongside you and come alongside me, modeling for us what it looks like, and is like to love God and honor people years and years and years down the road.
[time=1121] And I am so very thankful for our senior adults, so thankful for legacy, for the ministry that has been formed for senior adults, and that's the great thing about legacy.
[time=1131] Legacy isn't just for senior adults, it's a place where senior adults come and while they might share a meal and they might have an activity, legacy has been formed and led in such a way whereby senior adults are coming to engage in ministry here and beyond these four walls,
[time=1146] it just thrills my soul to see senior adults with hearts that are growing, with spirits that are expanding with a willingness to go that I hope each of us, but aren't quite there yet, we'll see and take notice of.
[time=1160] So thank God for our senior adults.
[time=1169] Something else, you asked me, what am I encouraged by, I want to just say this to you, I'm so thankful for what's coming up this fall as it relates to men's ministry and women's ministry, and specifically I'm so thankful for the opportunities that exist for so many of you with men's Bible
[time=1186] Studies, we call it power equipment, meets on Thursday mornings and Thursday evenings, and women's Bible studies, you can read all about these in your bulletin this morning, but I just want to say this, when I look at what's coming for you men, for instance, the book of Philippians, and I think about Steve Longbrake's involvement, I'm so thankful for John Wessel and what he's brought to that, Greg Deeson and Bob Purdy now coming alongside, giving more and more support, guys, every guy in this room, men, you have a chance to come and meet with others.
[time=1215] You have a chance to come and meet with other men, and to be taught the life-changing principles of God's Word, and if you can't come at 6.30 on Thursdays, you can come at 5.30 on Thursday evenings, we meet right here on site, and you can study God's Word and meet with a small group of men, and have your life changed, have your heart grown, and that excites me.
[time=1241] When I start that up again, I just go, "Wow, every guy in this room should be there." Women, you've got a chance, both studies, the morning study and the evening study have to do with the topic of prayer.
[time=1254] Karen Beck is leading that morning study, and the evening study is a video series with facilitated discussion times, led by Deb Marcourt and her team.
[time=1264] In the 1980s, you need to go and be a part of that. I'm so encouraged as to what that can do and bring and what that can offer you in the everyday of your life.
[time=1275] Now, you know what else? I am so excited these days, and I am so very grateful that God brought to this place, and specifically to our students, Jesse Hannah.
[time=1286] I'm so thankful for Jesse and Amy, and I am so grateful for what we see already God doing. Maybe you've heard, I've heard, the word is out.
[time=1295] I talk to students, I talk to parents, I am so very grateful for Jesse. Hannah, so thankful for Mark Rhodes and Dave Walters, and for Adam Layman and Brianna Ballschmidt, our interns this summer, but what God is doing in student ministries.
[time=1309] If you haven't got your kids there on a Sunday morning or a Wednesday night yet, boy, you've got to do your best mom and dad to try and encourage them in that direction.
[time=1317] If you've got friends who have kids, student ministry, age kids, do your best to get them there, we hear nothing but encouraging things about what God's doing in and through Jesse and his team, so thankful for that.
[time=1330] So thankful again this summer for the raft trip, many of you support the raft trip and what God has done through Tom Cashin and his team.
[time=1338] So very thankful for the lives that were changed for all of eternity because of the investment this place and other places continue to make in students.
[time=1347] I'm so thankful for Rick Vance, many of you know Rick who for years invested in the student ministry culture here at Blackhawk.
[time=1355] He left a number of legacies, one of which is the students who continue to this day to offer themselves to those on their campuses and those in their lives and Jesse and that team now get to work with these kids and I'm so very thankful.
[time=1371] So thankful for what God's doing. Children's ministry, just a couple others. Children's ministry, as most of you know and you can see in your bulletin,
[time=1379] there's a children's ministry sign up opportunity for you to jump onto that team that will serve these kids, realize again people, hundreds and hundreds of kids.
[time=1390] Young little boys and girls who we get the privilege of making a spiritual and life investment in on a weekly basis.
[time=1398] I am so thankful for what I believe in my heart God's going to do, not only in the kids lives but in your lives.
[time=1404] Let me just say this to you, as it relates to the weekly commitment and the nine month opportunity as this new team gets formed, many of you in this room should be on that team.
[time=1415] Many of you who are empty nesters, let's say, maybe you've got the kids that are kind of growing up and they may be gone or they might be close to being gone,
[time=1424] but truth be told you've got some opportunity now to roll up your sleeves and do what others did for you and your kids as they were growing.
[time=1432] Many of you that are on your own have a chance now to jump back in and pour some punch and break open a few graham crackers and play a game and share a story.
[time=1443] Some of you who are new, I can't think of a better way if Black Hawk is new to you.
[time=1453] I can't think of a better way for you to meet some people and become part of a team than to join the children's ministry opportunity and give yourselves to these kids that God gives us week after week.
[time=1464] Single adult, let me just say this to you, maybe you're not married, you're in college, however that works, you're kind of a single adult guy or gal, you may meet your partner for life over a glass of punch, you never know.
[time=1477] God may have just that right guy or gal over a game in the gym or maybe sharing a story, single adults, empty nesters, new people.
[time=1488] It may be time for some of you to leave your established Sunday morning routine.
[time=1494] You know what, the group or the class, they'll be there when you get back.
[time=1498] It may be time for some of you older high school kids to jump in and roll up serving sleeves, but I am so encouraged because I believe in my heart
[time=1506] that God is going to do amazing things in the lives of kids and in the lives of you in this room who will today go out there or next Sunday go out there or during the week call in and say you know what, we'll help.
[time=1518] Put us somewhere where we can be involved.
[time=1521] Hey, lastly, I want to say this, I'm thankful for our two more things.
[time=1524] I'm thankful for what you all have.
[time=1527] We've all, everybody in the room, we've all at one point kind of looked each other in the eye.
[time=1532] And we've knotted our heads and at least I'm under the impression that we're really in this thing together, this thing being the greatest endeavor of all, helping seekers find and know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=1547] Here, here and across the world.
[time=1551] And we mean that and you know that God is giving us opportunities here and across the world.
[time=1556] And one of those opportunities across the world is Blackhawks involvement in the Antioch initiative.
[time=1561] Five local churches in the Northeast Indiana arena coming together, collaborating to make an investment, not just of resources, but time and energy and spiritual gifting and teaching and leading and encouraging a church in Ivanovo.
[time=1576] It's in the Vladimir region of Russia.
[time=1578] And this church in Ivanovo was having an amazing impact on 25, 30 other churches in that region.
[time=1584] And we get the chance to love on these people and invest in them.
[time=1587] I went last October.
[time=1588] Many of you prayed for me.
[time=1590] And others from our team as we went in October, this October, I'm not going back, but Bob Purdy is.
[time=1597] Bob Purdy's going back with a team from Blackhawk to lead and to teach those 25, 30 pastors through the Book of Acts in one week.
[time=1606] And then I'm thankful because in 07, in 07, probably somewhere the first half of 07, Corbin, I don't even know if Corbin knows this yet, but we're going to Russia, Corbin and I.
[time=1617] And we're working on getting the worship team and we're going to go over there with worship and arts people to encourage and come alongside the musical community in this faithful church there in Ivanovo.
[time=1629] And I can't wait to go and to be with them, so pray for us and be thankful and be excited for what God is doing in and through our ministry here and around the world.
[time=1640] I'm so very thankful for the opportunity God gives you and me to be a part of life-changing stuff like that.
[time=1647] I want to say one more thing to you.
[time=1650] You know, there is one, we've talked about this before.
[time=1655] There is one and he's very real.
[time=1658] Scriptures speak very clearly about the enemy.
[time=1663] And you and I know that the enemy would be against.
[time=1668] And the enemy would be doing all that he can to discourage and dissuade all the above.
[time=1674] Everything that I just kind of rattled off to you from my heart there, there is one who is against it.
[time=1681] He hates it for the passion because he hates what's true and right and good.
[time=1687] And the enemy, while he is busy on many, many fronts these days, my friends, I would just draw your attention if I could to your bullets and inside your bullets and you'll find a postcard about an upcoming series.
[time=1703] While the enemy is involved on many fronts, my friends, you don't need me to stand here and tell you that one front that he is extremely active on is his pursuit of your children.
[time=1717] And that's exactly what he's up to. The enemy is wanting in some very real and in some very amazing ways.
[time=1725] He is trying to abduct, you see it there, kidnapped. Satan's attempt to abduct our next generation.
[time=1733] And I give you this card this morning for two reasons. I want you to pray and my friends, I don't just say that to you.
[time=1739] I'm saying that to you and hoping that you understand I am really, we are asking you to pray for this series.
[time=1746] Begin September 10th, turn that card over. Our children are in danger.
[time=1750] They're being stalked by one who wants nothing more than to see their lives diminished and their hearts and their futures destroyed.
[time=1757] Satan is attempting to capture our next generation.
[time=1761] Over a four week span, beginning Sunday morning September 10th, we'll gather at Blackhawk Ministries in an effort to expose the enemy's plan of attack and better prepare ourselves for a fight worth fighting.
[time=1773] A fight for the future of our next generation.
[time=1777] Over the four weeks we'll be looking at why Satan cares about our kids.
[time=1782] Exposing the enemy's plan, purposeful, I can't wait for this one, purposeful parenting in a pleasure-driven world.
[time=1790] And the last week we'll conclude with get your hands off our kids, the community of God responds.
[time=1797] I hope that while you may be tempted to put this on your refrigerator or somewhere in your home and I'm okay with that, really I give this to you today because I really hope that you'll invite someone to come.
[time=1809] And I mean that.
[time=1811] I hope that your heart and I hope that your mind, I hope that you would see the opportunity that something like this represents for those in your world, those that you work with, those that you live near, people may be in your extended family.
[time=1825] My friends, this is a topic that so many of us, you may have kids, you may not have kids, but it doesn't really matter.
[time=1831] Every one of us has the opportunity to make some kind of an investment in the young people of today.
[time=1838] And we want to see what God's Word has to say about this.
[time=1841] We want to do our best to be a community of Christ followers that can be prepared to face this ongoing incessant attack by the enemy against our children.
[time=1853] And I hope you'll be there, I hope you'll give this to somebody, I hope you'll talk with them about it, I hope you'll make the invitation.
[time=1862] You know, thinking about that, thinking about the enemy, most of you know me, those of you that know me pretty well, even if you don't know me really well, you just know by and large if you know me at all that I'm a pretty optimistic guy.
[time=1882] I mean for me the glass is usually more than half full, but I got to tell you as I think about you and as I think about your life and as I think about this world that we live in,
[time=1893] when I think about me, when I think about my family and your family and I think about these attempts by the enemy to abduct our next generation, my mind is just sobered immediately.
[time=1906] I find myself at times afraid, I find myself at times so very concerned for us.
[time=1913] I'm reminded of a quote from John Eldridge, many of you have heard of John Eldridge, he wrote books like The Sacred Romance and Wild at Heart.
[time=1922] John Eldridge says this, the story of your life, and I've read this to you before, think about this again this morning, the story of your life, each and every person in this room, the story of your life is the story of the long, brutal assault upon your heart.
[time=1938] By the enemy who knows what you can be, the enemy who knows what you can be, he knows you can make a difference through the grace of God and by the power of God.
[time=1952] See, the enemy knows that you and I can make a difference as we live on our faith, he knows you can parent in a certain way, he knows you can conduct yourself in the marketplace in a certain way.
[time=1965] See, he knows the kind of influence that you can have on a struggling neighbor, he knows what conferences like love and respect could do to your marriage and he knows what a healthy God honoring marriage can do.
[time=1978] See, he knows who you can be and he fears it because he is so deeply committed to trying to move you and I away from all that is right and good and true.
[time=1992] You know, the Apostle Paul, I think as I read through his letters, there are times where I sense in the Apostle Paul the same kind of concern, the same level of fear, if you will, this same realization of what the enemy is up to and this fear, this concern that grows in the heart of a leader or pastor because he loves his flock and he wants for them what's best and there's several places in the New Testament where you can see this kind of oozing out of him.
[time=2021] I'm going to take you this morning to 2 Corinthians 11, go to 2 Corinthians 11, 3 for it's in that chapter, in that verse, in the 2nd letter to the church at Corinth where Paul comes to this point where he says this.
[time=2033] He says in 2 Corinthians 11, 3, he says, "I am afraid, but I'm afraid," he says, "and I want you to stop right there for a moment because I want you to understand that when the Apostle Paul says here in 11, 3, that he's afraid, he's not saying that he's just
[time=2050] slightly sort of kind of concerned, he's not saying that this is just kind of a passing thing, that he caught a quick glance at and he has just a few mild questions about.
[time=2061] See, the word he uses there, but I am afraid, it's the word phobeo, phobeo, P-H-O-B-E-O in the Greek, and that word means a terrifying and deep-seated alarm which seizes and grips the soul.
[time=2078] My friends, he is terrified at what he sees, he's terrified, he is afraid, there is a deep seizing of his soul that makes him stand back and go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute here, I'm afraid for you."
[time=2101] I'm afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, he is so crafty, he is so deceptive.
[time=2112] I'm afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, you're minds.
[time=2118] Notice he says, "minds," not your bodies, not your practices, but the places you go, your mind, he's worried that your minds will be led astray from the simplicity
[time=2129] and purity of devotion to Christ.
[time=2137] Interesting there, if you look at the text, that your minds will be led astray from the simple, pure devotion.
[time=2148] These aren't bad people, my friends, these are people like you and me, these are people who, by and large, had a simple and pure devotion, they wanted to do what was right.
[time=2161] And yet the craftiness and the scheming and the deception of the evil one can make its way, and all of a sudden, those who were simply and purely devoted get led astray, and it scares him to death.
[time=2179] You say, "Why are you afraid? Why are you concerned?" That's why there are times I get concerned.
[time=2184] I'm reminded of the words of the great theologian and preacher from London back at the end of the 1700s, his name was Charles Spurgeon.
[time=2194] And Charles Spurgeon said this, my friend's about the enemy.
[time=2197] He said, and I want you to read this, it says, "There is nothing." Spurgeon said, "There is nothing that Satan can do for his evil cause that he does not do."
[time=2208] Look at that.
[time=2209] There isn't anything that he can do, that he doesn't do.
[time=2213] He is going to do everything he can for his cause.
[time=2218] We may be, you and I at times, may be half-hearted, but he never is.
[time=2222] He is the very image of ceaseless industry and untiring earnestness with his evil.
[time=2228] He will do all that can be done in the time span of his permitted rage.
[time=2234] We may be sure that he will never lose a day.
[time=2243] And so there are times where I'm scared.
[time=2249] And I know there's a great ending to this.
[time=2253] Let me get there.
[time=2255] But there are times when I get really, really concerned.
[time=2259] And you know what, sometimes late, late at night, sometimes it's early, early in the morning.
[time=2268] It just depends on how you look at that.
[time=2270] But there are times when I will, when I'm feeling that, I'll just pray.
[time=2276] I'll pray for Deborah and the kids.
[time=2279] They're usually the first that come to my mind.
[time=2283] There are times when I'll kneel down next to a bed at night and just look at their faces
[time=2291] laying there on those pillows.
[time=2294] And as I kneel down next to a bed or as I sit at the foot of a bed, or sometimes I'll just stand there in the room.
[time=2301] And you know, you can hear them breathing and you can see their forms there.
[time=2306] I'll just thank God for each of them.
[time=2309] And then I'll just quietly, so as not to alarm them, I'll just quietly cry out to God.
[time=2317] And I'll just beg, beg God for help.
[time=2324] There's times where I'll just stand there and pray and just beg Him to help.
[time=2330] Deborah and I have the courage and the insight and the wisdom that we need today to love and lead them in the way that we should.
[time=2340] Because they're up against it, you know.
[time=2342] There is an enemy who knows what they can be.
[time=2346] And he fears it, so he's fighting.
[time=2350] And at those same times, and I want you to know this, and I don't say this to you for a pat on the back.
[time=2355] I don't say this to you to look good, spiritual, or anything other than I'm just being honest with you.
[time=2366] There are times, sometimes in those late at night settings, sometimes while I'm running, sometimes while I'm driving, that I'll pray for my other family.
[time=2378] And that would be you.
[time=2382] I'll just pray for you all, I pray for you all a lot.
[time=2387] And I pray for you by name.
[time=2390] That's why sometimes I work so hard on names.
[time=2392] I'll just pray for you by name, sometimes I'll pray for you by face, because there's some faces and I haven't quite got names and faces.
[time=2399] And for others of you, I'll just pray for you as part of this family.
[time=2403] But I'll pray that even though your devotion at times would be sincere and pure, that even though you would know better,
[time=2411] that you might allow, that you might not allow the enemy to lead you astray from Christ.
[time=2419] And so I pray.
[time=2420] And I am so grateful, my friends.
[time=2422] I learned about and had modeled for me this praying for the church from the Apostle Paul.
[time=2429] That's right, as you read through his letters to the church at Rome and the church at Corinth and the church at Thessalonica and Colossae.
[time=2436] When you read through the epistles, you see him again and again and again praying for these people.
[time=2442] From deep down in his heart, he is so concerned and he so loves them and he so cares for them.
[time=2448] And I don't want to take you to all of them, all of those examples.
[time=2452] But this morning I want you to see a very special one to me, found in Colossians chapter 1.
[time=2457] Would you turn there?
[time=2458] Colossians 1.
[time=2461] And I want you to just see at the beginning there of Colossians where it says in the third verse, third, third and fourth verse.
[time=2474] Thanks, Dino.
[time=2475] It says we give thanks to God.
[time=2477] You see it there?
[time=2479] It says we give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you.
[time=2486] And in verse 4 it says, "Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints."
[time=2495] He goes on at the down there a few verses from there in Colossians 1, 9.
[time=2503] And this is what I want you to take note of.
[time=2505] Having said in verses 3 and 4 how he prays often and always for them.
[time=2510] It says there in Colossians 1, 9 he says this, "For this reason also since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you." The same guy who was terrified.
[time=2521] The same guy who was so concerned.
[time=2523] The same guy who was so aware of the enemy's efforts.
[time=2526] And he says we have not ceased to pray for you.
[time=2529] And to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[time=2537] So that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.
[time=2547] Strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience.
[time=2554] Joyously giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
[time=2564] You know what I want you to see this morning and next week is this.
[time=2568] This is Paul's prayer.
[time=2570] Paul was so very aware of the stakes, my friend, and he prayed this.
[time=2576] And this is my, this is what I pray for you.
[time=2582] This is what I pray for you individually.
[time=2585] This is what I pray for you as couples.
[time=2589] This is what I pray for you again and again and again.
[time=2593] Paul's prayer and mine is that you would, and I want you just to see these things, that you would know his will,
[time=2600] that you would walk worthy, that you would please him, that you would bear fruit, that you would really know God,
[time=2608] and that you would gain spiritual strength.
[time=2614] And in these next few minutes, if I can, I want to just take you back up to the top.
[time=2619] Can you just give me a few more minutes? Let me just, let me jump into this.
[time=2624] And I hope you'll get out of pen and I hope you'll open up your heart and mind.
[time=2628] And while I'm telling you, this is my prayer for you and I think there's great application there.
[time=2633] My friends, this is a great prayer for anybody.
[time=2637] Anybody you would know, anybody who you would have a heart for, anybody who has come to faith in Christ, and you would want to see them be all that God intended them to be.
[time=2646] Because that's how I feel about you.
[time=2648] I want so deeply for each and every one of you to be all, to experience all the fullness of what he has planned for you.
[time=2657] I want each and every one of you, young people and moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas, to know and experience what it means to live life and serve God in a way whereby he is able to maximize all that he gave you.
[time=2674] And for that endeavor, Paul prays this prayer.
[time=2679] And it's my prayer as well.
[time=2682] Number one, look at that.
[time=2684] That you would know his will.
[time=2686] Paul prayed and I pray that each and every one of you in this room this morning would know, you see it there, for this reason since the day we heard of it, verse 9, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will.
[time=2703] I believe what this refers to, that's twofold.
[time=2708] Let me just say this to you this way.
[time=2711] Number one, I pray that each and every one of you, I pray that we would be faithful to teach and explain to you, each and every one of you, the great truth of this book.
[time=2725] Because in this book, my friends, these ancient words ever true, in this book, in the Word of God, in the Holy Scriptures, you find the revealed will of God.
[time=2738] God is very clear.
[time=2740] He has established it.
[time=2741] He has laid it out and it's inviting and it's life-giving and it brings joy and peace when you understand what the will of God is for you in your marriage.
[time=2751] What the will of God is for you in the marketplace.
[time=2754] What the will of God is for you as it relates to your mind and the way you think.
[time=2758] What the will of God is for you as it relates to sharing your faith.
[time=2763] What the will of God, see I want you to know the will of God in each and every arena of your life.
[time=2771] And you don't get it, you don't grasp it by just kind of just thinking about it.
[time=2777] You get it when there are those who come along and help you understand and see and grasp it.
[time=2784] You understand it when you yourself are.
[time=2787] Because you're being encouraged and equipped, you yourself come along and begin to feed on the great truths of God's Word.
[time=2794] There isn't an issue in your life.
[time=2797] Not one that his Word doesn't speak to.
[time=2801] There is guidance to be found, there is direction to be experienced and I pray that you would in every arena of your life know his will.
[time=2813] And there's a part of that will that's not confusing.
[time=2816] It's not nebulous.
[time=2818] It's not unclear.
[time=2819] It's very, very clear and it's right here and we're going to keep doing our very best to help you grasp it.
[time=2827] Now there is another part of his will like who you're going to marry or what job you're going to take and we could go look all day long.
[time=2836] We're not going to find a chapter and verse on some questions that you and I come up against where we're wanting to know what the will of God is.
[time=2845] In those cases I want you to know his will.
[time=2848] In those cases I want to be someone and we want to be a place where you get encouraged to so grow in your relationship with him.
[time=2856] To so grow in your knowledge of him.
[time=2859] To so grow in your relationships with those who love him and who love you.
[time=2864] Our hope is that as all of that's taking place the spirit of God who moves in your life and mind could be detected.
[time=2871] As the spirit of God moves we pray and our hope is that you would sense that.
[time=2876] See when you're walking with him to sense and to discern where he's leading gets a little bit easier.
[time=2884] And our hope is that you would know his will, his revealed established will and his permissive will.
[time=2894] You know what I'm so thankful for is I bump into people who come here they'll visit from different places and you know I'll have conversations with people out and about.
[time=2906] I'll be at the gas station, I'll be at the grocery store, I'll be you'd be amazed at some places I've been where I've ended up having the Bible hour discussion.
[time=2917] It's really uncanny.
[time=2919] But I'll tell you what if I just tracked on a chart all of those discussions I would not be lying to you.
[time=2928] I would not be stretching the data in any way shape or form if I said to you that 90% of the time if the conversation goes to anything regarding why it is they would get up at seven in the morning and watch church.
[time=2946] Or why it is after five years of watching they just decided to come and be here.
[time=2952] Ninety percent of the time if the conversation goes that far it's always the same answer because where they were they didn't get what?
[time=2963] This.
[time=2966] And all of a sudden they find this opportunity to have the life giving eternity altering truth of God's word just explained to them and taught to them and built into them.
[time=2979] And when they get that they begin to understand what the will of God is for them.
[time=2985] And we were designed to know and to experience the will of God and so when we come back to that it's sweet and it feels right.
[time=2995] And I'm so very thankful that all of you and all of us on this team have the chance to be a part of something like that.
[time=3002] I pray, Paul prayed and I pray that you would walk worthy.
[time=3007] You see that back in our text?
[time=3009] It said that you may be, he prays that they would be filled with the knowledge of his will and all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[time=3018] So that verse 10 so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord.
[time=3024] Stop right there.
[time=3027] You see this same phraseology in Ephesians 4 and you see it again here in Colossians 1 it talks about a worthy walk.
[time=3035] What's a worthy, what does it mean to walk worthy?
[time=3040] We've explained this to you before, let me say it to you again.
[time=3043] To walk worthy in the Greek the way that's structured it simply means this.
[time=3047] It means that what you say, it means that what you profess, it means what you would state about yourself spiritually.
[time=3063] You do your very best.
[time=3068] I'm not talking about perfection.
[time=3070] I'm talking about the effort and direction of your heart, what you say you are, what you state to be true about you spiritually.
[time=3078] To walk worthy means then to from the heart give a genuine movement to live consistently with what you say and state you are.
[time=3089] To say that you have fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ and then to walk away from that statement and live and choose purposefully in a different direction willfully again and again and again is not to walk worthy.
[time=3105] Now I'm not saying that a worthy walk is to state this and then live this all the time because you and I know you don't do that and you and I know that I don't do that.
[time=3116] A worthy walk is a heart that having stated this genuinely, day after day, week after week, by God's grace and with His help is wanting to move in the direction of obedience and God honoring living, God honoring choosing, God honoring family, God honoring at work.
[time=3141] It's consistency and He prays that these people would have worthy walks.
[time=3148] He says to please Him, look at verse 10.
[time=3151] He wants Him to be filled with the knowledge of His will, verse 9, verse 10 so that they will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord and then look what it says to please Him.
[time=3162] And I don't want you to miss those next three words because this would be the thrust and I think the great import here in this point to please Him in what?
[time=3172] Say it out loud.
[time=3175] In all respects.
[time=3178] Do you understand what all respects means?
[time=3182] You probably do.
[time=3183] I mean think about that just for a moment, to please Him, Paul's praying that these people would be pleasing to God, obedient to God, respectful of God, sensitive to God that they would be pleasing to God in all respects.
[time=3200] Here in the gathering, sure, that would be part of in all respects but also my friends at the computer, at the computer early in the morning late at night and I'm not, and I'm not just talking to guys, that you would be pleasing to Him in all respects.
[time=3226] Young people, on a date, do you still date, is that what they call it?
[time=3231] When a guy and a girl go somewhere together alone, whatever you call that?
[time=3239] Pleasing, pleasing to Him, honoring Him, making much of Him, not your desires but honoring Him, pleasing to Him in all respects on a date at the computer.
[time=3258] In class, some of you in the room are going away to school, others have already left, there's a segment of us that will find themselves in a dormitory on an upcoming weekend.
[time=3270] And Paul's prayer for them and my prayer for you is that you would be pleasing to Him.
[time=3277] You know what my friends, there are so many pressures on you and me to please so many other people.
[time=3284] And He prayed and I pray for you that you would be in your marriages, that you would be in the way that you handle yourself with your kids in conflict, that you would be with those that work for you, with those you work for, in the car, driving down Colosseum,
[time=3303] in the midst of all that traffic, trying to get that left-turn arrow, wherever in all respects, He's praised that these people would be, and I pray for you, that you would be pleasing to Him, and that you would bear fruit, that you would bear fruit.
[time=3323] We'll come back and look at bearing fruit, being a people who really, truly bear fruit, what that looks like and what that means.
[time=3332] We'll come back and look at what it means to really know God and to gain spiritual strength.
[time=3338] This was His prayer in the midst of a culture that scared Him to death, and in the midst of a culture that at times so concerns me, for your sakes and for mine, it's my prayer as well.
[time=3352] And we'll keep working our way through it next Sunday, and thank you so very much for giving me the chance to share these things.
[time=3358] Would you stand, as we close, don't forget today, four o'clock, not at still water, not at still water, but right here in the worship center, those of you getting baptized, you can report at the same time.
[time=3370] We'll go through the same drill, it's just going to be here inside, away from the weather, and let me pray, let me pray for us as we go.
[time=3378] Father God, thank You, and we mean that. Lord, thanks for the privilege that You give us to in the midst of great temptation, in the midst of the enemy's incessant onslaught of options that He would want to move us toward.
[time=3398] God, thank You that in the midst of that, we can be anchored, we can have a foundation. God, there can be some strength and stability in our relationship with You, in our relationship with those that You've placed around us.
[time=3413] God, here in the body of Christ, we can experience times where our hearts and minds are renewed, where direction and vision get clarified, and yet, and yet we have to walk out these doors.
[time=3429] And so, God, as we walk out these doors today, I will, and so many of us here at Blackhawk in leadership, will continue to pray this for our friends.
[time=3439] And I pray, God, that as we pray it, I pray, God, that those who listen today would be open and receptive to it, that we could take this passage, every one of us in this room, and read it this week, that we could be reminded again and again and again this week as we open up Your Scriptures.
[time=3455] And as we read Colossians 1, 9 to 12, I pray that as we read that this week, God, I pray that we would give ourselves to experiencing those things with Your help and the encouragement of others.
[time=3468] Thank You.
[time=3469] For those who will be baptized tonight, we're so thankful to get to celebrate life with them, and we'll look forward to being together this afternoon, and we'll give you all the glory in Your Son's name, we pray. Amen.
