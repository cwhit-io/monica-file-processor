[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=28] and on earth, therefore go and make disciples of all needs, baptizing them in the name of
[time=39] the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=50] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and, lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=56] the end of the age, helping seekers find and follow Christ."
[time=86] "Great is your faithfulness, O God, you wrestle with the sinner's heart.
[time=103] You lead us by still waters into mercy, and nothing can keep us apart.
[time=115] So remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise, O God, your grace is
[time=136] enough, your grace is enough, your grace is enough.
[time=145] You lead us by God, glory." "Great is your love and justice, God, you use the meat to lead the strong.
[time=167] You lead us in your song of your salvation." "And all your people sing along, so remember, so remember your people, remember your children,
[time=192] remember your promise, O God, your grace is enough.
[time=201] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough, for me, just your grace is enough, your grace
[time=224] is enough, for me, remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise, O God,
[time=244] your grace is enough, your grace is enough, your grace is enough, for me, God, your grace
[time=264] is enough, your grace is enough, for me, God, your grace is enough, your grace is enough,
[time=290] for me."
[time=316] Many of you in the room would know that you've heard me say it, I've heard you say it, you've
[time=324] seen us do our very best with God's help, I believe to live it out, we've done by his
[time=331] grace at times okay with that endeavor, there are times we haven't, we'll continue to work at this, but most of you in the room would know that we at Blackhawk are giving ourselves
[time=342] to what we call the greatest endeavor of all, it is the opportunity that God has given us to help seeking people, find and know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=354] Most of you know as well that we're trying with his help to do that, not only in Fort Wayne but across the world and we are so privileged and so blessed by God to have numerous opportunities
[time=366] to be used of him in different settings and different cultures across the world and as we learn and as we grow in that, we're so thankful.
[time=374] One of those settings is in what used to be the USSR now, the country of Russia and
[time=380] in the region of Ivanovo, we have met a good friend and we have met some great people and
[time=386] through Slavic Gospel and the coalition, the team that's been formed, we call it the Antioch
[time=392] Initiative and there's five churches, five or six churches in this area that have come
[time=398] together to do our very best to support, come alongside, encourage, train, equip, whatever
[time=404] we can do to help these people in that region be all that they can be.
[time=411] Not only have a church but have a ministry there outside that church in a way that would bring great glory and honor to God and in the process we have met a good friend and he is with me on stage here this morning, we're joined by Mary who is from Wallen Baptist and is a great translator, she's catching every word and I want you this morning to, before we go any further, give a real welcome to a good friend.
[time=433] This is from Ivanovo, Pastor Vladimir, you've heard me talk about Pastor Vladimir.
[time=439] You know that we went there, we've been there several times now, we have developed a good friendship, we have been served and loved on by him and his people, they took great care
[time=450] of us and they continue to be there in the midst of amazing things, doing faithfully
[time=456] what God has called them to and so he's in the states, he's here visiting the churches in the coalition, we'll gather together, all the churches are coming here Sunday night, the 10th of September for a worship service but we wanted you to see him and just hear briefly from him this morning so please, Blackhawk, would you welcome Pastor Vladimir from Ivanovo.
[time=483] Well, let me just say this, let me ask this, it's good to have you here, welcome.
[time=493] Maybe if Pastor Vladimir, if you could just share with the people how the Antioch Initiative,
[time=499] the churches from the Northern Indiana area here, the opportunity that we've had to come and be with you, how has that encouraged you personally and how has that encouraged the
[time=510] churches in the region there in Bladimor.
[time=512] Thank you.
[time=533] And it's really a joy for me to be here with you today.
[time=542] I'm really glad that Brother Kelly, your pastor, came with a group to our church.
[time=551] They were able to do pastors teaching for our pastors and missionaries.
[time=559] That was a wonderful time, great blessing.
[time=567] So choir and singers and musicians came from your church in the year 2000.
[time=576] And there are other groups that have come helping with our children's homes.
[time=584] And we want to give you our heartfelt thanks to your church for participating in the work in our region.
[time=590] And we hope that that won't be the first and last visit to us.
[time=614] We're expecting that many more of you will come.
[time=618] [AMEN] We are so looking forward to, for instance, in October, Bob Purdy and a team from Black
[time=625] Hock will be going for another pastor's training session.
[time=628] You see Bladimor and Sergey, his associate, they have an amazing relationship with 25, 30 other pastors, men who have great respect for Bladimor and his leadership, and they
[time=640] are scattered around those two regions.
[time=643] They're like states, the Bladimor region and the Yvonnevo region.
[time=647] So there are these guys out there, and they're just doing their very best, some in very small meager settings to preach and to teach and to pastor.
[time=656] And they gather when we come, those from the coalition, these pastors all come to the church
[time=662] in Yvonnevo.
[time=664] And we teach them all week long, five, six days in a row, all day long, and they just soak it up.
[time=669] And so these are men that we want to pray for as well.
[time=672] And Bladimor's role in their lives is one that is crucial.
[time=676] And Bob's going in October to teach through the book of Acts, and then Corbin and I will be going with worship team members, I think in June, and ministering there as well, really
[time=687] looking forward to that.
[time=689] How can we pray?
[time=690] Just real quickly.
[time=691] How can we pray for what God's doing in Yvonnevo?
[time=695] In our area of Russia, in Yvonnevo, in Vladimir Oblas, there are many difficulties and complications
[time=710] for the ministry.
[time=718] We had a number of years of great freedom, but now that's ending, and there are more and more difficulties and repression.
[time=729] So I would ask you to pray for us, for the pastors and the missionaries.
[time=734] Pray for me that God would give me strength, strength as I preach the gospel and wisdom.
[time=745] Because we're being repressed by the authorities and also by the Orthodox Church.
[time=752] We know that God sees the situations, and we believe that we can still reach many people
[time=760] with the gospel.
[time=764] But I pray that I ask that you would pray for our missionaries that they would have the financial support they need to do the work.
[time=772] [AMEN] Would you join me as we pray for Bladimor?
[time=777] Just bow your heads.
[time=778] The ashes are going to come forward.
[time=779] Let me just take a moment and let's just pray as a family along those lines.
[time=784] And again, remember as you pray, pray today with me, but pray tomorrow and pray next week.
[time=788] And as you think about it in the days and weeks and months to come, please as a family continue to pray for what God is doing here.
[time=796] When Bladimor says repressed by the authorities and the Orthodox Church, you and I have no idea what that entails.
[time=805] And there is a pressure there and there is a movement now in recent days against that freedom that these dear brothers and sisters are having to live under so we want to hold them up.
[time=817] Father God, we thank you for the privilege of being here today with this dear brother.
[time=821] Thank you for the countless people that he represents those giving their lives, those giving so much for the sake of the gospel and what's true and right in that region.
[time=832] Father, as they face pressure and as they face persecution, as they face others who would come against them, in some cases strongly and with great determination.
[time=845] Father God, we pray you give them grace.
[time=847] We pray you give them peace and strength and we pray you give them an appropriate boldness to go where they need to go and say what they need to say and God in the midst of all of that I pray and we pray that they would know in sense of your great power and that they would know in sense that we love them and that we care deeply for what they're doing and that we stand with them though in ocean apart we stand together, united in this effort
[time=873] to buy your grace and for your glory, help seeking people find and know what it means
[time=879] to follow Christ.
[time=882] As we give this morning, Father God, I pray that we would give with great generosity.
[time=887] I pray that we would give with great sacrifice, I pray God that we would give trusting you knowing that from the first fruits from whatever it is that you've provided God that we would
[time=898] immediately write off the top give and give with a great sense of excitement for what
[time=904] you will do with the gift here and across the world.
[time=909] We pray all this in your precious son's name, amen.
[time=913] [AMEN] Thank you.
[time=915] [AMEN]
[time=945] Praise the Lord, oh my Lord, for ever magnified, magnified, your great name, forever.
[time=975] Sing this next verse, it's high.
[time=982] Who am I in heaven by you and who on the earth can compare to your words?
[time=992] Who am I in heaven by you?
[time=995] Nothing can compare with your love, nothing can compare with your love, nothing can compare
[time=1022] with your love, nothing can compare with your love, nothing can compare with your love,
[time=1036] God like you, praise the Lord, oh my soul, forever, magnified, your great name, forever.
[time=1080] Praise the Lord, oh my soul, forever, magnified, your great name, forever, magnified, your
[time=1109] love, it is capable, no one so true, unmistakable, irreplaceable, unbelievable, no God like
[time=1125] you, there is no God like you, praise the Lord, oh my soul, oh, forever, magnified, your
[time=1138] great name, forever, praise the Lord, oh my soul, forever, magnified, your great name,
[time=1194] [AMEN] Well, it is really nice to get to be together.
[time=1204] I failed earlier to mention that we are really grateful for you.
[time=1208] If you're here, we're grateful for all of you.
[time=1210] You may be here for the first time.
[time=1211] You may be a guest.
[time=1213] And if you're a guest this morning, then please just accept our heartfelt welcome to you.
[time=1218] We hope you feel welcomed.
[time=1219] We'd love to get to know you better.
[time=1221] There's a couple of things you could do, there's a card right there in the Pew Rack in front of you.
[time=1226] If you could fill that card out, we would really, really appreciate it.
[time=1229] And then after the service as a guest, we have a guest center right out through these double doors.
[time=1234] There's some folks out there that would really love to get to know you a little bit better.
[time=1238] They can answer questions that you might have about Blackhawk.
[time=1241] They can kind of point you in the right direction.
[time=1243] They can introduce you to some people, give you some things to think about.
[time=1246] And if that's something that you'd like to do, we'd love to meet you there.
[time=1249] So please give some thought to that.
[time=1252] Hey kids, kids, kids, kids, are you with me kids?
[time=1256] I got something for you.
[time=1257] I just thought it'd be nice since you were here.
[time=1260] I thought you would just maybe enjoy this.
[time=1263] Sometimes kids, you hear me talk about when I was young.
[time=1267] And I was young at one point.
[time=1269] I was the time when I was five or six, seven, eight, nine.
[time=1272] There was a day when I know exactly what you're going through right now, wishing the guy would just be quiet so we could go home and have lunch.
[time=1280] But here's the deal.
[time=1281] We're going to say a few things this morning and then we are going to go have lunch.
[time=1285] But I just want you to know, somebody recently said to me, "How come when you talk about yourself when you were little, you always say you had the same ears then that you have now?" There it is, right there.
[time=1302] So go ahead and just laugh right now.
[time=1304] Just one big collective laugh, get it out of the way because those ears right there, those are these right here.
[time=1310] And you thought I was exaggerating, I'm not, I had those, I had these ears when I, that was me when I was my kindergarten picture, any kindergarteners in the room, any kindergarteners in the room.
[time=1321] That was Pastor Kelly when he was in kindergarten right there.
[time=1325] And anyway, that's enough of that, why don't you take that off the screen.
[time=1329] And just know, kids, hey kids, just know that, you know, I used to get teased, they used
[time=1335] to call me Dumbo when I was a little guy.
[time=1338] They always say things about my big ears and I just want you to know it gets better.
[time=1343] Whatever they're teasing you about today, whatever you're having to endure, you know what it gets, it gets better and time goes by and you grow up to be 43 with absolutely
[time=1353] no scars whatsoever on the ear thing, all right?
[time=1356] It's okay.
[time=1357] Speaking of kids, I had to read this to you, I got this, this week, I read it the first time I read it, I thought it was really, really cute.
[time=1366] I read it a second time and I, and I fell apart right there at my desk and I'll try not
[time=1374] to this morning, but I just, I had to share it with you.
[time=1378] It is the, it is that thing that we've always, all of us have experienced, it's the, it's
[time=1384] the words of a, of a child just capturing great truth effortlessly and maybe even without
[time=1392] even meaning to, but I just, this was a young gal who got baptized last Sunday night as
[time=1399] we gathered to celebrate that and she had written out, she had, she had typed out on
[time=1405] her little computer, 10 year old, she had typed out her story, but she got a little
[time=1411] nervous up in the tank with the big lights and so she didn't read it, but she wanted to make sure that I got it and so it got sent to me this week and she says, my name
[time=1422] is and she says her name several years ago on a Sunday morning, we were at church and
[time=1428] Pastor Kelly spoke about Jesus dying on the cross for our sins.
[time=1432] The rest of the day I thought about how sad that was, it was very, very sad that evening
[time=1438] while I was taking a bath with my sisters, I told my mom how sad I was and my mom said
[time=1444] that it was sad that Jesus had to die for our sins, but the good news was that next
[time=1450] week, Pastor Kelly would tell the rest of the story about Jesus rose from the dead and that we can go to heaven too and be with him.
[time=1458] My mom asked if I wanted to go to heaven and be with him and I said yes.
[time=1462] My mom then said that what I needed to do was to just say a simple from my heart, a simple
[time=1468] prayer and that he would hear me and I said okay and so my mom said, repeat after me, dear Lord, I am a sinner and I said, dear Lord, I am a singer.
[time=1485] My mom said, did you say sinner or singer?
[time=1495] And I said singer because I don't want to be a sinner.
[time=1503] My mom said nobody wants to be a sinner.
[time=1509] We are born that way and I said okay, fine, dear Lord, I am a sinner.
[time=1516] I am sorry for my sins.
[time=1519] Please come into my heart and forgive my sins, amen.
[time=1527] And I read that that second time and I thought wow, you know, that's really, really true.
[time=1534] Down deep inside, nobody, nobody wants to be a sinner.
[time=1543] Down deep inside created in the image of God, we were designed to be like him and we were
[time=1549] designed by God to bring great glory and great honor to him.
[time=1552] We were designed by God to please God, to serve and love God and yet sin, you know,
[time=1559] erect all that and so when we come to faith in Christ and we fully surrender ourselves
[time=1565] to him, he makes us new and there's still a fight, there's still a battle, there will be this battle against sin to the day you and I die and go to be with him if in fact you know him.
[time=1578] And I was even thinking about some others that I know, some other friendships that God's allowed me to develop with people who to this date have not crossed over that line of faith have not surrendered their heart and life to him and though they might say certain things and though they might act certain ways, you know, what God allows us to see, he's allowed me to see it deep in their heart is the fact that they don't like it either.
[time=1600] They don't want to be sinners.
[time=1603] Down deep inside, Romans 1 talks about that void and that emptiness and so I just continue
[time=1609] to pray for 10 year old girls and people like you that we would come to understand what
[time=1615] it means to really know him and to follow him and that's kind of where we went last week in our time together.
[time=1621] We were talking about the Kidnapped series and I do want to say this to you about the Kidnapped series in those four weeks and I feel like it's just probably healthy for me to say this to you, we will teach and we will speak and we will view some things
[time=1636] and we will engage at a very frank and honest level and I'm always trying to be sensitive.
[time=1645] I think most of you know that, I try not to say things from up here knowing that there are certain ages in the room but those four weeks we're going to, you know, and I don't know what age to tell you.
[time=1655] I think 10 and above is probably a good ballpark but we're going to be very, very honest in
[time=1661] the way that we deal with this subject and I'm inviting you to come Saturday night and pray with us 915.
[time=1668] I'm inviting each and every one of you to come and to bring your friends and to bring your family and we're going to just get on our knees and ask God over those four weeks to do something really special and powerful and unique.
[time=1678] In our lives, in the lives of kids, in the lives of our community, so many people are already talking about it, so many folks have already been invited and I really hope and pray that you'll extend the invitation to some people on your block, to some people where you work, some people in your family but as we talked about that, that led me to share
[time=1698] with you a couple of quotes and I wonder if we can put that Spurgeon quote up this morning.
[time=1704] Let's just kind of go back to where we were last week and let me finish this up before we move on to the series next week.
[time=1711] Last week I told you I was concerned and the reason I'm concerned is because we've come to know you and I, we know the enemy and we know what he's about.
[time=1720] It's Charles Spurgeon, a couple hundred years ago, said it this way as it relates to the enemy.
[time=1725] There is nothing that Satan can do for his evil cause that he does not do.
[time=1730] He may be half-hearted but he never is, he is the very image of ceaseless industry and
[time=1737] untiring earnestness with his evil.
[time=1741] He will do all that can be done.
[time=1745] Don't miss that.
[time=1747] Anything that he's allowed to do, God has given him some, some rain, God has given him some room in this time of permitted rage but as it relates to you, whatever you or I would
[time=1758] allow him to do, he will do.
[time=1761] He will do all that can be done.
[time=1764] He will stop at absolutely nothing to ruin you, to destroy you, to shrink and diminish
[time=1772] your heart and spirit.
[time=1773] He will do all that can be done.
[time=1776] In the time span of his permitted rage, we may be sure that he will never lose a day.
[time=1783] He will never miss an opportunity.
[time=1786] He will never sit back and let something go by.
[time=1789] He will at every turn, in every setting, do everything he can to get inside your head
[time=1796] and move your heart away from what is true and right and good.
[time=1801] So I get concerned and I only know really when you whittle it all down, if you just
[time=1810] kind of take everything away and you whittle it down to the basic bottom line response that I might personally have to that, I only know to do two things.
[time=1820] And the first thing is, we talked about last week, I just get on my knees and I pray for
[time=1826] you.
[time=1827] I pray for many of you by name, I pray for many of you by faces, I pray for the rest of you as a collective part of this body of believers that God has given us here and I pray for you.
[time=1838] I pray for you in the morning, I pray for you at noon, I pray for you at night, I pray for you in the midst of the day, I continue to do my very best with His help to lift you up.
[time=1847] And I pray what Paul prayed, as he prayed for the church at Colossae, open your Bibles
[time=1853] if you would, to Colossians chapter 1, let me just show this to you, Colossians 1, we're going to go to verse 9.
[time=1861] Colossians 1-9 and Paul said there, we talked about it last week, you know, Paul was concerned
[time=1868] as well, he talked about it in his letter to the church at Corinth, he said he was terrified, said he was afraid, gripped by the thought of the enemy, capturing and moving their devoted
[time=1879] hearts away from Christ.
[time=1881] And we see him here in Colossians praying for this reason, verse 9, he says, since the day we heard of it, it meaning their faith.
[time=1889] Since the day we heard of your faith, we have not ceased, Paul says, to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding
[time=1901] so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing
[time=1907] fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened, verse
[time=1913] 11, strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to
[time=1926] share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
[time=1931] And so I pray that and I wanted to last week and we got through it for the most part, I
[time=1937] want to come back and revisit some things, but I wanted you to sense and I wanted you to know that there are leaders in this place, there are pastors and elders, there are folks who love you a great deal and many of them know you by name and many of them know you by face and many of us don't know all of you by name or face, but still collectively we as leaders pray these things for you.
[time=1960] Paul prayed and I just want you to know we pray that you would and we just kind of worked
[time=1967] our way down through there and just by way of review, I'll just say it to you just briefly, we pray that you will know his will.
[time=1973] My friends we pray and I, it's on my heart often that each of you would know the revealed
[time=1979] and expressed will of God, will, God's will, what he's designed for you, what he wants
[time=1985] for you, the course that he has laid out for you, we pray that you would know his will.
[time=1993] I was thinking about it this week, you know I've lived enough life, many of you in the room have lived more life than I, you and I both know there's one place you don't want to be, you really don't want to be outside of his will, his will.
[time=2008] Many of you in the room can speak to what it's like to live life outside the expressed
[time=2015] and revealed will of God.
[time=2018] It's not how he designed you to live, it's not what he wants for you, we pray that you would know his will.
[time=2024] We talked about the will of God that we can't find a chapter in verse 4.
[time=2030] I don't know necessarily what his will is for you on the job, should you take it, should you reject it, who should you marry, where should you go to school.
[time=2039] I mean there's things, situations and circumstances and decisions that you and I have to make that we can't find a chapter in verse on, it's okay, God gives you the spirit of God
[time=2050] and God gives you wise counsel and we pray that through the spirit of God and through the
[time=2056] word of God and through wise counsel that you would, every one of you, I'm talking to
[time=2062] every person here that knows him, we pray for you that you would know his will.
[time=2067] We want that for you.
[time=2068] Secondly, Paul's prayer in mind is that you would walk worthy, that you would say this
[time=2074] and that you would live this, that what you say and what you live, what you genuinely attempt
[time=2081] to live, the course that you genuinely attempt to walk down.
[time=2086] We pray that what you say and the course that you genuinely pursue, I say genuinely because
[time=2092] I don't want you to think I'm, I don't want you to think I'm meaning perfectly, I'm talking about the pattern of your life and the genuine direction of your heart, walking worthy is when what you say and what you do come together, consistent.
[time=2108] Paul's prayer in mind is that you would know his will, that you would walk worthy, that you would please him.
[time=2113] We talked about this briefly.
[time=2114] The key to that phrase, the key to that verse my friends is at the end of that phrase.
[time=2119] It's in verse 10 says to please him in all what, to please him in all respects.
[time=2126] People listen, kids listen, students listen, moms and dads, senior adults, God is pleased.
[time=2136] God is happy.
[time=2138] God is, is full of joy.
[time=2140] God is pleased when you and I obey him.
[time=2144] When you and I love him, when you and I honor him in the everyday of our life in all respects,
[time=2151] not just inside these four walls, but when you and I leave these four walls, in all respects
[time=2157] with your spouse, with your children on a business trip, in the office, Paul prays that
[time=2166] and I pray that you would please him, honor him, love him, obey him, represent him in all
[time=2173] respects, in each and every place that he would be pleased with the decisions that you
[time=2180] and I make, with the direction that you and I move in, with the attitudes that you and I harbor so that you will walk in a worthy, in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please
[time=2193] him in all respects bearing fruit.
[time=2195] We just had gotten to this point, let me just say this about bearing fruit.
[time=2199] Some of you in the room are very new to a study of God's word and I say that I'm praying that you will bear fruit and you're wondering what in the world is he talking about?
[time=2209] He's talking to me as if I'm some tree or some bush.
[time=2212] You know, here's the thing, spiritually it is a great analogy.
[time=2216] God's word makes this great analogy.
[time=2218] He gives us this picture of people and I'll watch.
[time=2221] People who have fully surrendered their hearts and lives to him.
[time=2224] When you come into that life changing relationship with him, when the spirit of God takes up residence, when you and I are redeemed and transformed and when we're made new and God
[time=2235] does that, when that happens and we begin to walk down that road with him, we begin to
[time=2241] in time as he grows us and as our minds and our hearts begin to understand what it means
[time=2248] to really follow him, we begin to bear fruit.
[time=2251] We begin to have attitudes and we begin to pursue certain courses of action that give
[time=2257] evidence to the fact that we really did get saved.
[time=2261] These actions or these attitudes don't save us.
[time=2265] God saved us.
[time=2267] We had nothing to do with that but we begin to bear fruit, we begin to make decisions
[time=2273] at work and we begin to make choices with our spouse and we begin to try and have a spiritual influence in our home and we begin to do things that, it's like apples popping
[time=2283] up on a tree.
[time=2284] It's like, wow, look at that, it's really an apple tree and I want that for you.
[time=2290] I pray for you that you would in increasing fashion bear more and more fruit.
[time=2296] Write this down.
[time=2297] Galatians 5, I would just encourage you to read through Galatians 5.
[time=2301] There it talks about the fruit of the Spirit and it also talks about the deeds of the what?
[time=2308] The flesh.
[time=2311] See there is ungodly fruit, if you will.
[time=2314] There are things, the scriptures call it the deeds of the flesh and see that's a person,
[time=2320] it's an individual whose life and patterns and choices and direction doesn't indicate
[time=2328] that redemption and spiritual transformation has transpired.
[time=2332] It's a great opportunity for you to think that through, a great opportunity for you to assess the condition of your own heart and you know what?
[time=2341] If anybody in the room goes to Galatians 5 and if you start to read that through and you begin to ask yourself, gee, is there any fruit in my life?
[time=2350] What really happened or what hasn't happened in me spiritually?
[time=2354] If you wanted to talk that through with someone, you just let us know, you just come up and talk to me, you just shoot us an email, you give us a call, if there's a desire in you
[time=2365] to get a better grasp of what has or hasn't transpired in your life spiritually, we would love to help you think that through.
[time=2371] Next, Paul's prayer and mine is that you would really, and I want you to note this, I want
[time=2377] you to write this down, I want you to just give me a couple minutes here.
[time=2381] Hey kids, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, it doesn't matter who you are, how old you
[time=2388] are, how much of life you've seen or haven't.
[time=2391] My prayer is that you would really, really know him.
[time=2399] Now that sounds a little cliche, let me say it to you again.
[time=2404] My prayer and my hope is that you would really, really, really, I mean like never before
[time=2413] that you would see him, that you would begin to understand him, that you would walk with
[time=2420] him when you think about really getting to know someone, that you would communicate with
[time=2426] him, that you would listen to him, that you would understand his attributes, that you would see his character, my friends, listen, here's the point.
[time=2434] My prayer, just like Paul's, Paul said it there in chapter 1, it says, bearing fruit
[time=2442] in every good work and increasing, in to verse 10, increasing in the knowledge of God.
[time=2449] See here's the point, I believe with all of my heart and have experienced this in just
[time=2455] the reality, the raw reality of my everyday life over the last 20-some years of knowing him, when you, when you know him, when you are really deeply and very personally devoted
[time=2467] to knowing him, when you expose yourself to him, when you read his word, when you hide
[time=2475] that truth in your heart, when you exercise your spiritual gifts, when you live life in community, an honest relationship with others, when you give yourself to knowing him and
[time=2486] all of his majesty and all of his glory and all of his goodness and all of his mercy,
[time=2493] when you get this picture of him that begins to just envelop your life, guess what?
[time=2499] Then the, then the, then the, the devious little life-destroying tactics of the enemy,
[time=2507] though those darts he throws, those offers that he makes, when the temptations come,
[time=2515] when the enemy tries to do his thing with you, and you're really, really, really growing
[time=2521] in your knowledge and your picture of who he is God and what he's like, then these, then
[time=2527] these, these arrows and these temptations and these attempts on his part to abduct, they
[time=2533] seem, they seem pathetic.
[time=2536] They seem small.
[time=2539] They feel uninviting, if that makes sense, but I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what,
[time=2545] and I know, if you're not, if you're not here, if you're not really, really growing in your
[time=2551] knowledge of him, if you're stale or detached or withdrawn from that pursuit and you're
[time=2558] trying somehow to live over here in limbo between really knowing him, then the temptations
[time=2564] and the opportunities and the offerings of the evil one, they don't seem pathetic and small, they actually seem inviting.
[time=2574] They actually seem worthwhile.
[time=2575] They actually seem like there might be something there.
[time=2578] They actually can appear to be offering life when in fact they offer death.
[time=2585] It has to do with your view of and your knowledge of and your experience of him.
[time=2591] I pray that you would really, really, really know him because when you really know him,
[time=2599] you really begin to understand him, little H, the evil one.
[time=2607] And I want you to see that clearly.
[time=2610] Paul prayed, and my prayer is that you would know his will, walk worthy, that you would
[time=2616] please him, that you would bear fruit, that you would really know him and that you would gain spiritual strength.
[time=2622] And let me just say this to you, that you would gain, that each and every one of you would bulk, that you would bulk up spiritually, that you would lift and run and watch what
[time=2634] you eat and spiritually take care of yourself so as to be strong.
[time=2641] And here's what I mean, I don't, I'm pleased, I'm not going to the muscle thing physically.
[time=2646] I just know that you and I need to be in the midst of the enemy's attempts and in the midst
[time=2653] of what he is offering, you and your friends and your family and your children.
[time=2660] People in the family of God, they need strength from each other.
[time=2664] They need there to be a source of stability and you and I can by God's grace.
[time=2669] We can, as we gain in spiritual strength and steadfastness, as it says there in the text,
[time=2675] we can be such an encouragement.
[time=2677] I think about my kids jumping off the dock out of our pond, you know, every one of them when they were young, couldn't swim, had no clue, sink to the bottom, die in a moment.
[time=2687] If I was in the water, no big deal, right, off they go, holding on to, resting in, the
[time=2696] strength of a father.
[time=2698] And I would just pray for each of you that you would be able to, and watch how this works, when you know, watch, watch, when you know, when you are given in your heart to knowing his will, walking worthy, pleasing him, bearing fruit, really knowing.
[time=2715] Guess what that develops in you?
[time=2717] Spiritual strength.
[time=2720] And my hope and prayer is that you would follow that.
[time=2722] Now that's the one thing I know to do, is to pray for you.
[time=2725] Secondly, and we're going to close with this, secondly, having prayed, Paul does the only
[time=2732] other thing he knows how to do, and it's the other thing that I know to do, and that is what he says in 27, go to 127, having prayed, here's what Paul did, here's what Paul gave
[time=2743] himself to, 28, sorry, verse 28.
[time=2748] And I want you to know this morning that this is my promise again to you, this is our commitment as leaders to you.
[time=2754] As we think about the prayer that we just prayed for, you know that deep in my heart, and it will never go away, it will never be diminished, we will never compromise this, we are going to do this.
[time=2765] This is all I know to do, to number one, to proclaim him.
[time=2768] See that?
[time=2769] Paul says we proclaim him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom
[time=2776] so that we may present every man complete in Christ.
[time=2783] I want you just to look at those three things, and I'm promising you today that we will continue to, in the gathering here on Sunday mornings, in small communities, in living rooms, you
[time=2794] know, all across the city, in group settings, in classroom settings, in men's Bible studies,
[time=2800] in women's Bible studies, we will continue to my friends.
[time=2804] This is what you do, you proclaim him.
[time=2808] There is only one claim that I will make, one central theme to all we do, one great truth
[time=2816] over and above all other claims that the world tries to put forth, and that is that Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus, redeems.
[time=2825] That's it, we will proclaim Christ.
[time=2829] We will proclaim the love and work of Christ.
[time=2833] We will say it, and we will sing it, and we will teach it, we will proclaim the Lord Jesus, that by grace through faith in him, he saves us and he transforms us and he makes
[time=2843] all things new.
[time=2845] We won't proclaim wealth, we won't proclaim positive thinking, we won't proclaim works
[time=2851] because you can't work your way there, we won't proclaim tradition, we will proclaim the Gospel.
[time=2859] The Gospel that saves us, the Gospel that sanctifies us, we will proclaim, we will put
[time=2865] up on a pedestal, and we will shout it from the highest mountain, we will say it in the restaurant booth, we will say it in the meeting, we will say it and proclaim it wherever we go, Christ, Jesus Christ, high and lifted up.
[time=2880] Secondly, admonishing every man, you see that?
[time=2884] We will, leadership in the church should do this, and I commit to you again, having prayed for you, and we will continue to pray that prayer for you, we will also admonish you.
[time=2893] It says that I am too, it says that we are to admonish every man.
[time=2897] My friends, real quickly admonish means to correct, it means to confront, it means that
[time=2903] I love you, and I love what's true, and I love God's will for your life enough to not
[time=2910] care about how you might think about me.
[time=2913] I love you more than what your response might be.
[time=2917] And so if I love you, and I know you, Paul says in Acts 2031 that he didn't stop for three years admonishing them with what?
[time=2925] With tears.
[time=2926] You see, it's not an angry thing, it's not a mad thing, it's not an I'm ticked off at you thing, it's a I love you, and we will admonish you.
[time=2935] It's the willingness for me to walk up to you, or you to walk up to me and say, you
[time=2941] know what?
[time=2943] This isn't working.
[time=2945] What you're doing here, the way you're responding, the choice you're about to make, the stuff I see you doing, it's wrong, it's sinful, it's outside of God's will, please, please,
[time=2956] come back and let's work on this together.
[time=2961] Husbands need to be admonished, wives need to be admonished, children need to be admonished, young adults need to be admonished, lovingly, and that's our commitment.
[time=2971] It doesn't just stop there though, look what it says, admonishing every man, teaching every man, not just presenting and proclaiming him and his truth, but explaining it, doing our
[time=2984] very best with God's help to week after week in whatever setting you might be in to explain the Word of God, to teach it, to make a positive truth, you know what?
[time=2994] It's why I hope so many of you are willing to go and be a part of the children's ministry opportunity this fall.
[time=3001] It's why I hope so many of you empty nesters and you senior adults and you single guys
[time=3007] and gals and even moms and dads, I hope you're going, I hope you're calling, I hope you're stopping by the table because you have the privilege of teaching, and I don't so much
[time=3017] mean exegetically verse by verse with great theological themes being dumped on five-year olds.
[time=3023] No, you teach them the truth when you sit with them and spend time with them and explain the very fundamental and life-changing principles of God's Word, and you do that over snacks
[time=3034] and you do that in a game and you do that in the teaching time and you do it when you sing with them, and I hope many of you will go and just say to the gals at that table,
[time=3045] you pick the hour, I'll be there, tell me where to go, let me help, let me teach, let
[time=3052] me admonish, let me proclaim.
[time=3056] We want to help you understand the truth of God's Word.
[time=3059] We don't want you though to just understand it.
[time=3062] Good teaching helps you grasp and apply it as well.
[time=3067] I promise that that's what we'll do.
[time=3070] We will pray for you and we will proclaim Him, we will admonish, we will teach.
[time=3075] And look at that last phrase there, presenting every man, wow, what a statement, so that we may present every man complete.
[time=3082] You see that?
[time=3084] Complete.
[time=3085] It means finished, my friends.
[time=3089] Understand this, maybe you do, maybe you don't.
[time=3092] Sometimes it leaves me literally shaking, that there will be a day when I, do you understand
[time=3098] this, that there will be a day when I will stand before God as it relates to the ministry that He gave me with you.
[time=3105] I will answer for the way in which I gave myself and His truth and this ministry to this endeavor,
[time=3113] to your heart and to your life, you will as well on your part of that.
[time=3117] But I'm, we are responsible and we want nothing more than to see you completed, to see you
[time=3128] made whole, to see you learn the lessons, you need to learn, to see you grasp the truth that you need to grasp, to watch you walk through life bearing fruit, knowing what His will is, pleasing to Him.
[time=3143] And here's what I want to leave you, I want to leave you with a picture and we're going to get out of here.
[time=3147] And I didn't even ask if this would be okay, so I might get in a little bit of trouble here.
[time=3152] But here's the picture that I want to leave you with.
[time=3154] Hey, Dell, would you and Agnes come here for a second?
[time=3158] Can you do that?
[time=3159] Just come here for one second and Corbin, you want to help them come up here.
[time=3164] And then I need, can I just have like five kids real quick?
[time=3167] Five kids, come on up, come here Starboys, yeah, you guys come on up and any kids that
[time=3173] want to come up, just come on up real quick, thanks Heartmans.
[time=3177] Give me five, great, good job on the kids, stop.
[time=3180] All right, good, no, no, come on kids, no, I met the kids that are coming, come.
[time=3184] If you're not coming by now, stop.
[time=3186] Just you guys come stand over here, would you?
[time=3188] Now be real quiet kids, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here kids over here, over here, over here, kids, over here, hey buddy, come on over here, hey dude, come over here, stand right here, Mr. Smith, good to see you, come over here, come back here, come here kids over here, over here, move this way over here, hey sweetie, you come stand up here in front right here, there we go, you guys, going down that end down there, would you?
[time=3210] All right, hi Heartmans, nice to see you both, back up here Dell, come back here, turn around
[time=3219] this way, so folks can see over there and back up this way a little bit, this is Dell and Agnes Hartman, good friends, known the Lord for a few years, yeah, quite a few,
[time=3234] and I know as I've gotten to know them, and as Dell and Agnes and I have spent time together as I've seen them in the life of this family, I know that while they love him and while they love this place and their family, how many kids do you have?
[time=3248] Two kids, grandkids, five grandkids, they love those kids, they love their family, they love
[time=3254] the ministry God's given them, I know in their hearts though, they can't wait some day to be with the Lord, they look forward to that time of being with the Lord, having lived
[time=3265] a bunch of years, a bunch of years together, and they're not, how many, how many together?
[time=3272] Fifty-eight years last week together, amen?
[time=3276] Now watch this, this is, this is strengthened, you with me?
[time=3287] This is strengthened, this isn't perfect, this is strengthened, and are stood as will.
[time=3294] They pleased Him, sometimes they didn't and they learned from that, but here is a couple
[time=3302] who having known Him and loved Him and followed Him, stand on the one end of the spectrum,
[time=3309] and will whenever God decides, go and be with Him, and there is great strength and maturity,
[time=3315] they are complete, well, they're going to be completed, but on this side, so many have
[time=3321] invested in them, and so many have taught them and here they stand.
[time=3325] Now this crew over here, how are we doing, you're doing good, yeah?
[time=3331] You guys, this is what, this is not completed, this, this is great, this, oh sorry dude,
[time=3340] are you all right?
[time=3341] I just whacked you on the head with my Bible, at least I didn't try and shove it down your throat right, all right, this, this is, this is, this is beautiful young ladies, handsome
[time=3354] young men, but you know what gang, this is raw, these, these dear boys and girls, they're,
[time=3360] they want to know the Lord, and they want to follow Him, and they're maybe learning how to do that, but in comparison, they don't know squat, they got nothing, but we get to
[time=3372] come along, and this is just like literal, I hope you're catching this.
[time=3376] So many of you, and I can remember when it was me, so many of us spiritually, are right where, right here, we need so much help, we need guidance, we need an investment of truth,
[time=3389] we need to be prayed for, we need to be taught, we need to be admonished, do your parents admonish you kids, yeah, do your parents sometimes have to admonish you, yeah, kind of get after
[time=3401] you a little bit, tell you to stop doing that, your parents do that, yeah, just want kids looking at me like what are you talking about, yeah, see and when you admonish, and when
[time=3412] you teach, and when you pray for, and when you give yourself to helping them know God's
[time=3418] will and be pleasing and bear fruit and gain strength and know Him, the time comes when
[time=3425] you get to present them, complete, and we need your help, we need you to help us teach
[time=3433] and admonish and present, we need you to be receptive to it so that we can enjoy as a
[time=3439] family this process, thank God, thank God for the young ones, literally young and spiritually
[time=3447] young that we get to invest in and thank God for those who have walked that road and left us a model and a path to follow, amen, would you stand and let's pray, can you kids just
[time=3459] stay here with me and we'll just pray, Hartman's you okay, let's pray together, Father God thank you so very much for the time together today and thank you for these kids and thank
[time=3470] you for the Hartman's and God thank you for what this picture represents and I pray God you'd give me in our leadership strength, I pray you'd give our family strength and courage to help move people down this continuum, down this road, God I pray that as we do that,
[time=3485] people would be receptive and humble and open to your work in them, I pray God that we could
[time=3491] celebrate that work and enjoy it together for days and weeks and months and Lord willing years to come and all the people agreed and said amen.
[time=3525] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=3615] You
