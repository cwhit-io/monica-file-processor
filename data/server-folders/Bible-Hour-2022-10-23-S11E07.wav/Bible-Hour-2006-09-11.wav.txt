[time=118] [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=208] - Hi, my friends, it's great to be with you again.
[time=210] I wanna just share with you this morning about a reality that I don't think we can deny.
[time=216] I think it is an unarguable, undeniable reality that we see in our culture.
[time=222] Culture at large, our Christian culture.
[time=225] Among those who claim to be God followers, even I think this is a reality that continues to grow and grow and grow.
[time=232] And that reality, my friends, is this.
[time=234] Marriages are failing.
[time=237] Marriages are struggling.
[time=239] Marriages are coming apart at the seams, at a rate and at a level like we've never seen before.
[time=245] And it breaks my heart that there are millions around the world, thousands in our own community, hundreds, maybe here in our own church, who aren't even coming close to experiencing what God designed for a husband and wife to experience in relationship with him, God, and in relationship with each other.
[time=265] I am so thankful that about a year ago, there was a time when I'd kind of gotten burnout to tell you the truth.
[time=272] I was just kind of fed up with all the marriage stuff that was out there.
[time=277] So many books, so many conferences, so many seminars, so many tapes.
[time=281] I think it was just overload, but about a year ago, my interest got peaked and my heart got so encouraged as I got reacquainted with an old friend.
[time=291] His name is Emerson Egrich.
[time=293] And Emerson has written a book called Love and Respect.
[time=297] It comes the theme and the flow of the book comes out of the last verse of Ephesians 5.
[time=304] And there is this idea of love and respect, and the book turned into a conference.
[time=309] And as I read the book and saw clips from the conference, I was so encouraged, and I was so thankful for what God was obviously going to be doing through Emerson.
[time=319] Dr. Dobson has since come across Emerson's material.
[time=323] Focus on the family has started to sponsor and come alongside Emerson in his efforts, and the Love and Respect ministry has just skyrocketed, and we're so thankful for what God is doing there.
[time=334] They're coming here.
[time=335] I want you to know this.
[time=337] Love and Respect.
[time=338] Emerson Egrich, his wife, and their whole team, they're coming here to Blackhawk at the end of September, and we want you to join us.
[time=345] It's going to be a two-day conference, and the dates and the times are going to be here on the screen.
[time=351] But I want you to think about coming, whether you have a great marriage, an OK marriage, or a struggling marriage.
[time=358] And I want you to be honest as you think about it.
[time=360] No matter where you are on that continuum, you need to come and be encouraged.
[time=364] You need to come and be reminded.
[time=366] You need to come and maybe learn for the first time some of the fundamental principles that God has for us as husbands and wives as we seek to love and respect each other in this greatest of all relationships.
[time=379] Emerson's been kind enough to record a clip, kind of a greeting to the Fort Wayne crowd.
[time=384] And so the guys are going to roll that now, and as you listen, I hope your heart will be not only encouraged.
[time=389] I hope there will be a sense in you where as you listen to what he says, you'll want to come and hear more.
[time=396] Stick around.
[time=396] At the end of the clip, there'll be some registration information, and we hope to see you there.
[time=401] I'm so thankful for all of you, and we hope this can be something that will encourage you and your spouse as you seek to have a marriage that could really bring great glory and honor to him, and that could bring great fulfillment and joy to your own hearts and lives.
[time=417] Male and female communication is a fun topic.
[time=420] Have you ever listened to how men and women talk?
[time=422] She says, I have nothing to wear.
[time=425] What she means is she has nothing new.
[time=428] A husband says, I have nothing to wear.
[time=431] What he means is he has nothing clean.
[time=434] I chuckle at that because both are saying the same words.
[time=438] Same words.
[time=439] I have nothing to wear.
[time=440] And yet they both mean something totally different.
[time=443] Male and female communication, we're different.
[time=446] We're not wrong, we're just different.
[time=448] My name is Emerson Eggrich, and my wife, Sarah and I, are coming to Fort Wayne, September 29.
[time=454] And we're going to be at Black Hawk Church, presenting the Love and Respect Marriage Conference.
[time=458] Kelly Bird and others have invited us to come, and we're looking forward to this with great excitement.
[time=463] What's this message all about?
[time=465] Well, Sarah, my wife says, this is the conference that men want to attend.
[time=469] And we hope that both husbands and wives will consider coming.
[time=473] But I made a discovery based on Ephesians 533.
[time=477] There the Apostle Paul says, husbands must love their wives, and wives must respect their husbands.
[time=483] There's a Love and Respect connection that I saw.
[time=486] When a wife feels unloved, she tends to react in ways that feel disrespectful to her husband.
[time=492] But she doesn't see that.
[time=494] And when a husband feels disrespected, he tends to react in ways that feel unloving to his wife.
[time=500] But he doesn't see that.
[time=501] And thus was born what I call the crazy cycle.
[time=504] Without love, she reacts without respect.
[time=508] And then without respect, he reacts without love.
[time=512] And then without love, she reacts without respect.
[time=514] And without respect, he reacts without love.
[time=515] And this baby starts to spin, and it gets crazy.
[time=519] Have you ever had a conflict with your spouse when suddenly the issue didn't seem to be the issue?
[time=523] You saw their spirit deflate.
[time=526] I believe in the majority of cases a wife is feeling unloved, and the husband is feeling disrespected.
[time=532] At the Love and Respect conference, we'll help you discover how to get off that crazy cycle.
[time=538] I want to invite you, September 29, to come to the conference.
[time=542] Love and Respect is coming to the region of Fort Wayne, focused on the family is sponsoring this event.
[time=548] Kelly Bird and all those at Black Hawk Church are preparing for your coming.
[time=552] Please contact the church or go to our website loveandrespect.com, all spelled out loveandrespect.com, and you'll find the contact information there.
[time=563] And we'll find out more about how men and women speak.
[time=566] We'll find out more than just I have nothing to wear.
[time=569] - That picture right there.
[time=576] I know it's kind of hard to look at, but I would just for a moment invite you to do so.
[time=581] Because I just want to be really clear, and I want us to be really honest with ourselves this morning about what God's word tells us the enemy is up to.
[time=593] And that right there is where Satan wants our kids.
[time=598] He wants the next generation chained up.
[time=604] He wants young men held captive in their secret struggles.
[time=609] He wants our young ladies in dark places far from our safety and love.
[time=613] He wants to deny them their dreams, crush their hopes, harden their hearts, fill their lives with guilt and shame.
[time=621] And he wants to, for a number of reasons, one of which is that quote that I keep telling you about from John Eldridge, read it a while ago in a book.
[time=634] And I want to remind you of what it says there.
[time=636] The story of your life is the story of the long brutal assault upon your heart by the enemy who knows what you can be and fears it.
[time=646] And my friends, that right there, that picture, that young boy, that's what Satan's after.
[time=654] Because he knows what our kids can be.
[time=658] He knows what young people have the potential to be.
[time=662] He knows, he knows that young, fully surrendered hearts will stop at nothing to fight for what's right, feed the poor, visit the sick, share their faith and serve those in need.
[time=676] He knows the unbridled spiritual passion of young Christ followers can change the world.
[time=684] And so my friends, he is relentless.
[time=687] He works tirelessly to preoccupy them today.
[time=692] With sex, with pornography, and with addictions and with insecurity and a disdain for parents and gossip, music and musicians that promote all the above along with a repeated theme of disrespect for authority, he preoccupies them with an ever-increasing obsession with the physical body and a growing appetite for greed.
[time=721] He backs up the truck every single day.
[time=725] And he dumps on them what the Apostle John and the book of 1 John called, "The Lust of the Flesh," "The Lust of the Eyes" and the boastful pride of life.
[time=735] He wants them, he wants young people.
[time=737] I'll just say it to you young people.
[time=740] He wants you silenced.
[time=743] He wants you out of the game.
[time=746] He doesn't want you in the mix.
[time=748] He knows what you can be.
[time=751] And he fears it and so he comes after you with everything he has, doing his very best to quiet you.
[time=759] Well, there's not a person in this room, I wouldn't suspect,
[time=767] that wants that to happen and every one of us would raise our hand and say, you know what, we don't want that to happen.
[time=776] That's not how we want this thing to go.
[time=779] And though it's happening today at a tragic and alarming rate, many of us in the room are realizing, some of us for the very first time, realizing that there are ways to appropriately protect our kids.
[time=792] We're realizing and learning that there are ways that we can fight this battle.
[time=797] The hearts and souls of our kids, we're realizing there are ways to equip and prepare our kids for the fight they need to engage in today and for the rest of their lives.
[time=809] We believe it's God's desire.
[time=811] I believe this with all my heart.
[time=812] I believe this deep inside of me.
[time=815] And there isn't anything that could change this.
[time=817] And I think there are many people in this room that believe this as well.
[time=821] I believe that God desires for young spiritual hearts to be growing and gaining and expanding
[time=832] their spiritual vitality as they grow older rather than young spiritual hearts passionate and engaged with God at the age of 14 becoming slowly but surely disengaged and having those hearts shrink and grow callous and cold by the time they turn 25.
[time=854] I think it's actually possible with God's help for us to see young hearts that as they grow in their years actually grow in their passion and their love and their devotion to him.
[time=869] While I believe that I would readily admit that the enemy is tripling.
[time=874] The enemy is quadrupling his effort to see those hearts crushed.
[time=880] To see those mindsets and those attitudes diminished.
[time=883] And we ask the question, why?
[time=887] Why does Satan care so much about our kids?
[time=892] Why is he making such an effort
[time=898] to captivate their hearts and minds?
[time=901] Think of it this way.
[time=902] Why do kids play such a strategic role in Satan's plan to advance evil?
[time=908] It's why he exists, my friends.
[time=910] He exists to advance evil.
[time=913] This is not a passive existence.
[time=915] He exists because he is absolutely contrary to God.
[time=920] He is against everything that God stands for.
[time=922] He abhors God, he abhors truth, and he wants nothing more than to advance his evil cause.
[time=928] And here's the amazing thing.
[time=930] From the beginning, he has targeted kids.
[time=937] Why is it that kids play such a strategic role
[time=943] in Satan's plan to advance evil?
[time=946] Here's what I want you to do.
[time=947] And just go with me here for a moment.
[time=949] I would invite you this morning to just envision a 10 to 18 year old.
[time=954] I mean, just go somewhere in there.
[time=956] And you may have one or two or three.
[time=958] You may know of some.
[time=959] You may have a nephew or a niece.
[time=960] You may have a grandson or a granddaughter.
[time=963] But just for a moment, just get the face and get the picture of a 10 to 18 year old kid
[time=971] in your heart, in your mind, in your mind's eye right now.
[time=973] Go ahead and do that.
[time=974] Just think about a 10, 12, 14, 60, 18 year old kid.
[time=979] I want you to do that.
[time=980] And as you do that, as you get this picture of that young person, I want you to realize what Satan gets if he can lure that one over to his side.
[time=990] I want you to think about that kid.
[time=995] You know, I talked to people over the last few weeks.
[time=997] I asked them to tell me.
[time=998] They just said, "Hey, tell me about kids." I mean, what's the thing about kids that stands out in your mind?
[time=1006] Well, what is it about a 10 to 18 year old that's unique?
[time=1009] What is it about a 10 to 18 year old that's so special?
[time=1012] What is it about a 10 to 18 year old that's kind of challenging?
[time=1016] I mean, I just asked and I just got answers.
[time=1018] And then I started to just write some things down.
[time=1020] What is it about kids?
[time=1021] And as I wrote my list down, and as I listened to people, there was a lot of similarity.
[time=1028] You know what I was reminded of?
[time=1031] I was reminded of how capable.
[time=1033] And you can write this down if you want to.
[time=1035] How capable kids are.
[time=1038] Kids are, kids are so, they're so capable.
[time=1042] They've got so many dreams.
[time=1045] They've got all this pent up, new, fresh talent and skill and ability.
[time=1051] They're just, they're so capable.
[time=1053] They can do so much.
[time=1054] They oftentimes don't know when to quit.
[time=1056] I mean, it's the reason tree forts get built, right?
[time=1059] They're just, there's something about a kid that's just so raw and unique and good.
[time=1065] And there's so much, there's so much to them that's so powerful, I think.
[time=1069] They are so capable.
[time=1070] The more I wrote and the more I listened, I wrote down they have amazing minds.
[time=1077] And now kids, I'm not talking about grades, really at this point.
[time=1081] I'm just talking about your mental capacity.
[time=1084] Kids, I miss my opinion.
[time=1086] Maybe you don't share it.
[time=1087] When I wrote it down and when I talk to people, I'm amazed at how quick kids are, mentally.
[time=1093] And especially today, the rate at which they're picking stuff up, their ability to grasp concepts, their vocabulary.
[time=1101] I mean, the way they can, they're learning machines.
[time=1104] You put a kid today, 10 to 18.
[time=1106] You put them in front of a computer for the first time.
[time=1109] You put them in a biology class for the first time.
[time=1111] You put them in certain settings and there's so much about kids.
[time=1115] And their minds, their minds are so gifted and they're so able.
[time=1119] It's incredible.
[time=1121] I watch my kids, just the younger ones, starting to sit in front of a computer.
[time=1126] And I watch them now at our home, doing things on a computer that I'm calling my assistant in once a week to help me with.
[time=1134] I mean, it's incredible how quick they are.
[time=1137] They're capable, mentally, they're amazing.
[time=1140] You know what they are too?
[time=1142] They are, I believe they're impressionable.
[time=1145] You know what I mean?
[time=1148] Kids are easily wowed.
[time=1152] Does that make sense?
[time=1155] Kids love to be wowed.
[time=1157] Kids are really impressed.
[time=1159] I mean, they're impressed with stuff.
[time=1162] I mean, you do a back flip and it's like, wow.
[time=1164] I mean, they see a big building and it's like, wow.
[time=1167] I mean, they see a big house.
[time=1168] I mean, they see stuff.
[time=1171] Oftentimes for kids, it's stuff that kind of just wows them and then they get a little bit older and then it's the expensive stuff.
[time=1178] It's the big stuff.
[time=1181] It's the impressive stuff.
[time=1183] See, they get wowed.
[time=1185] And here's the thing.
[time=1186] I think they get loyal as well to the one that wows them.
[time=1192] I think there's something in kids that connects.
[time=1198] They're so impressionable and they become loyal to those that wow them.
[time=1204] They are so capable.
[time=1205] They have amazing minds.
[time=1206] They're impressionable.
[time=1208] And look at this, I heard this again and again and it's been my own experience.
[time=1211] Kids flourish when given an identity.
[time=1215] Kids flourish when they sense as if, for whatever reason,
[time=1221] that they've actually become somebody.
[time=1225] It just lights them up.
[time=1227] I was thinking about, when I was a late teens, early twenties, I played a lot of basketball.
[time=1232] Most of you know that.
[time=1233] And I would find myself, usually in the summers, work in basketball camps.
[time=1238] I would go on trips and play basketball.
[time=1240] I went overseas and played basketball.
[time=1242] I would find myself in situations where we would be at these camps.
[time=1246] We'd be doing these clinics and inevitably, whenever kids show up at a camp, there are always those kids.
[time=1252] And you could spot them a mile away.
[time=1254] There are those kids who came with nothing.
[time=1257] There are kids who, I would meet young, 10, 11, 12, 13-year-old boys, sometimes girls, who you could just tell that what they had come out of was absolutely nothing.
[time=1266] They had nothing.
[time=1268] Many of them had nobody.
[time=1269] Many of them came without moms or without dads.
[time=1271] Many of them financially, socioeconomically, just as poor as you could get.
[time=1277] They would show up at these camps and they'd come to play basketball and you could just see it in their eyes.
[time=1281] This emptiness and this longing to just somehow, some way be somebody.
[time=1287] And then an amazing thing would happen.
[time=1289] You know, we divide the whole camp up into what?
[time=1294] Teams.
[time=1295] And you divide the whole camp up into teams and you line them up and then they come by and you give them their, what?
[time=1301] You give them their jersey.
[time=1302] And you know your jerseys had names on them and there were Bulldogs and there were Mustangs and there were Braves and there were, you know, you got a name for your teams.
[time=1313] There were the Eagles and you'd hand this jersey to a kid who had nothing and all of a sudden his eyes and his soul would just light up and he'd throw that jersey on and he wouldn't take it off for the entire week.
[time=1330] He'd sleep with it and he'd show up with it and you knew come Friday that it had not left his body because with that jersey he finally had a what?
[time=1339] An identity.
[time=1342] He was finally somebody.
[time=1343] Didn't matter that he was a Bulldog.
[time=1345] He was just somebody and kids, they flourish, they come alive when they connect with an identity and the opportunity to be something and someone.
[time=1359] Now here is the amazing thing, not mysterious because it's just the way God always does this.
[time=1365] I make my list there on the screen.
[time=1368] Many of you helped me make that list and I think you know what, as always, I gotta go and see what God's word says about this whole kidnapped thing.
[time=1378] So I start working my way through the scriptures and I start studying and looking at situations where we see kidnapping going on in the scriptures.
[time=1390] You know, and I've told you from the beginning when you heard us talk about this series, I told you that this is not a new deal.
[time=1395] Satan's been after kids from the beginning and as I began to delve into this, I realized that in one of the first recorded kidnappings in all of scripture, as I read through it and as it began to unfold for me, I was absolutely astonished and amazed and so grateful for the clarity of scripture and the things that I see here in Daniel chapter one
[time=1421] and the way that it relates to that list you and I just made.
[time=1424] I mean, it's just incredible how this plays out.
[time=1426] I wanna show this to you.
[time=1427] Turn to Daniel one and the first, one of the first recorded kidnappings in biblical record and I want you to see what it was about these kids that the evil one was so interested in.
[time=1442] And as we always do here at Black Hawk, let me just invite you to stand and honor of God's word and if I can, let me just read this to you.
[time=1449] Daniel chapter one, Daniel chapter one verse one.
[time=1454] It says, "In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim,
[time=1460] King of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and besieged it." Let me just, hold on, eyes up here just for a moment.
[time=1468] Nebuchadnezzar is the evil one.
[time=1472] Nebuchadnezzar comes from Babylon wanting to do nothing but besiege and take captive Israel, lead it to its ruin and have for himself all that he could glean from it.
[time=1484] So he comes and he takes Israel, Nebuchadnezzar does.
[time=1487] The Lord gave Jehoiakim, King of Judah, into his hand along with some of the vessels of the house of God and he brought them, Nebuchadnezzar did.
[time=1495] He brought them to the land of Sheinar, some 1,500 miles away.
[time=1501] He takes them back to the land of Sheinar, to the house of his God, little G.
[time=1506] And he brought the vessels into the treasury of his God.
[time=1508] And then, verse three, the king, Nebuchadnezzar, ordered Asphanas.
[time=1513] Asphanas was the chief of his officials and he orders him to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles.
[time=1523] Youth, here you go, see if this doesn't sound familiar.
[time=1526] Youth in whom was no defect, who were good looking, showing intelligence in every branch of wisdom, endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge, and who had the ability for serving in the king's court.
[time=1539] And he ordered him, Nebuchadnezzar, orders Asphanas to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
[time=1547] And the king appointed for them a daily ration from the king's choice food, the king's choice food.
[time=1556] And from the wine, which he drank, and appointed that they should be educated three years, at the end of which they were to enter the kings.
[time=1565] Nebuchadnezzar, the evil one, they were to enter the king's personal service.
[time=1570] Now, among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hennania, Mishael, and Azariah.
[time=1577] Then the commander of the officials, here you go, assigned new names to them.
[time=1585] And to Daniel, he assigned the name Belte Chazar, to Hennania, Shadrach, to Mishael, Meshach, and to Azariah, Abednego.
[time=1597] Kidnapped.
[time=1602] Satan's attempt to abduct the next generation.
[time=1608] Pray with me, would you?
[time=1611] Father God, we stand humbly before you this morning, and we would want to be a people, with kids without kids, doesn't matter, it's part of a family here.
[time=1623] We would wanna be people who would, in appropriate ways, with real wisdom and with real discernment God, protect, invest and love our kids.
[time=1633] Many of them, Father, in all reality, right now are in the process, there are many in the process of being kidnapped.
[time=1641] And we would want to respond in a way, God, that would bring great glory to you and bring great benefit to their lives.
[time=1650] And Father, as we think about this series, we've prayed for kids, and we've prayed for adults, and we've prayed God for those in the room, even today, who as they looked at that picture of that young boy in the honesty of their own souls, realized they themselves are being held captive today.
[time=1668] And so God, for all of them, we pray, that they would experience and know the freedom found in you.
[time=1675] For all of them, we would pray, God, that these days together would give us wisdom and discernment that we could open our hearts with great humility and learn what needs to be learned, change, whatever might need to be changed, make adjustments in the way that we live and approach life.
[time=1692] God, we pray that you would, in a mighty and powerful way, do your work through these efforts.
[time=1699] In your son's name, we pray, amen.
[time=1702] You can be seated.
[time=1703] Well, I don't know if you caught the connection,
[time=1709] but I'm gonna try and spell it out for you here as we just make our way through this passage.
[time=1713] You know, the enemy, my friends, Satan, he has a very clear plan.
[time=1719] There is a reason that he targets kids, and Nebuchadnezzar had a very clear plan, and the evil that he wanted to promote, the gains that he wanted to make as he approaches these young Jewish boys.
[time=1735] I mean, it's so clear.
[time=1737] It just jumps off the page, and it's so consistent with what we had just said a few minutes ago about kids.
[time=1743] Let me show you.
[time=1744] Number one, Nebuchadnezzar's Neb's evil plan required, and there's our list that we had just made of kids.
[time=1754] Now watch this.
[time=1754] Number one, Nebuchadnezzar's plan, as the text unfolds, was to separate.
[time=1759] Number one, to separate capable kids from their families.
[time=1764] Capable kids being separated from their families.
[time=1770] He comes and he besieges Jerusalem, and he takes, not only the vessels from the temple, but it says he takes these young boys 1500 miles away from their home.
[time=1781] In his attempt to advance his evil plan, he knows he can't have those boys close to home.
[time=1787] He can't have them with those who have been giving care over them.
[time=1790] He can't have them near those who have been making an investment in them.
[time=1794] He can't have those boys anywhere near those individuals who tuck 'em in at night and wake 'em up in the morning.
[time=1801] He knows if evil is going to progress, he has got to separate capable kids from their families.
[time=1809] Then the king ordered Asphon as, verse three, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles.
[time=1819] Youth in whom was no defect who were good looking, showing intelligence in every branch of wisdom, endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge, and who had ability.
[time=1830] Kids, my friends, are capable.
[time=1835] And he is, he is trying, listen, he is trying to bring, and he's working really hard at it.
[time=1841] He is trying to bring tension and distance between parents and kids.
[time=1846] He wants to kidnap your kids.
[time=1849] He wants to kidnap mine.
[time=1851] He wants to abduct the next generation.
[time=1853] And one thing he does again and again is try and remove them from us.
[time=1858] Try and remove us from them and create a distance marked by relational tension and friction.
[time=1866] And you say, "How do you know this?" What have you been, have you been snooping around my house?
[time=1876] What do you got, you got cameras?
[time=1877] What's going on here?
[time=1879] And it's just as always, my friends, no.
[time=1881] I'm just living life with you.
[time=1883] Faced in the same battles you face, seeing the same things play out in my own home that play out in yours.
[time=1890] All that giftedness that kids have, all the ability, all the talent.
[time=1897] See, he wants to take control of it.
[time=1900] And to do so, he needs moms and dads and families out of the mix.
[time=1905] And so here's what happens.
[time=1906] See what happens is then you get 10, 11, 12 year old kids who, for the most part, kind of unwittingly, unknowingly.
[time=1914] I mean, they've never been 10 or 11 before.
[time=1916] I mean, they were eight, but they've never been 11.
[time=1918] And so now they're 11 and they're starting to hear things and they're starting to see things and they're starting to experience some stuff.
[time=1926] And then don't forget, I hope everybody's on the same page here.
[time=1929] Kids are sinful, right?
[time=1934] By nature, sinful, born that way.
[time=1939] Their sinfulness is cute at age two.
[time=1941] It gets deadly by age 12.
[time=1945] They're sinful, so they got that going for them.
[time=1948] Then they get culture speaking into their lives.
[time=1950] They got the enemy wanting to separate them.
[time=1952] And then you start hearing things like, hey, hey mom and dad, I'd like my own space.
[time=1957] My space.
[time=1962] They say, they want my own space.
[time=1964] They say, hey, would you mind closing the door?
[time=1967] They want a text message and pics message
[time=1974] and email and voicemail and I am themselves into oblivion.
[time=1978] And no, no, you can't read any of it, mom and dad.
[time=1982] It's my stuff.
[time=1984] And I'm gonna go out now.
[time=1986] No, I don't know when I'm gonna come back and I'm not sure what the movie's rated and stop asking so many questions.
[time=1992] They say.
[time=1995] And sometimes they just say it and sometimes they act that way but that's the message, back off.
[time=2004] And then so, and then what happens is then you get,
[time=2010] sometimes I think sometimes well-intending most of the time
[time=2019] lacking courage and love, parents who say, well, okay.
[time=2029] 'Cause I translated, I certainly don't wanna tick you off
[time=2036] and I certainly don't want you to throw a fit.
[time=2039] I certainly don't want you mad at me.
[time=2042] I certainly don't want the tension that comes in this home when I've said no and you pop a gasket 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-year-old, I don't wanna deal with that.
[time=2052] So translated, okay.
[time=2056] And then the parent just continues to pay for the cell phone
[time=2063] and the computer extras and keep the door shut and wonders and wonders one day down the road,
[time=2073] how in the world it got so distant, wonders how in the world we got here.
[time=2080] 'Cause the enemy's plan has been from the beginning
[time=2086] to separate capable kids from parents.
[time=2090] You say, I say, 'cause I live there right with you,
[time=2097] what are we to do?
[time=2098] How can we lovingly in a God honoring son and daughter honoring way, how can we come at this?
[time=2106] I just wanna take you back.
[time=2107] I wanna take you back to where we should always go.
[time=2110] We should always go to the scriptures and when you go to the scriptures on this one, you see this back at the beginning even.
[time=2116] You find this amazing model that I think so many times you and I have lost sight of and I wanna just invite you to turn to Deuteronomy six, if you will.
[time=2126] Deuteronomy six, verses four to eight and here we see God's design, the way in which you and I are to combat the enemy's desire to see us separated from, distanced from our kids.
[time=2142] In Deuteronomy, let me just read this for you.
[time=2144] It says, hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=2149] Goes on in verse five to say, love the Lord your God.
[time=2153] Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
[time=2158] These commandments that I give you today see, here he's talking to adults, here he's talking to the big people, to the grownups.
[time=2166] And he says here, these commandments that I give you today, grownups are to be upon your hearts, take these commands, these truths and have them deposited deeply in your hearts.
[time=2179] There's a reason, look at verse seven, having deposited them deeply in your hearts.
[time=2183] Then it says, impress them, impress them on your children.
[time=2188] And this word, this phrase, impress, in the Hebrew it, it had, it painted the picture of a kind of a broad blanket covering and it would be laid down over and it wasn't laid down over harshly and it wasn't laid down over rigidly.
[time=2203] It was a careful yet purposeful placement of this blanket of truth, impress it, he says.
[time=2211] Now watch, impress it on their hearts, impress them on your children, talk about them, these truths, these principles, these values.
[time=2222] Look at this, talk about them when you sit at home with who, with your kids.
[time=2230] He's talking about, this is about, he was talking to adults, now he's talking about adults passing these things onto kids and so the text just flows.
[time=2238] Talk about them when you sit at home with your kids and when you walk along the road with your kids
[time=2248] and when you lie down with your kids and when you get up with your kids, when you're at home and when you walk and when you lie down and when you get up in verse eight, he goes on and says, tie them these truths that symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads and whatever's a symbol on your hand and whatever's on your forehead, guess what?
[time=2269] The kid's gonna see it and you're gonna get to talk about it and it's gonna be part of your existence as you walk with them and lie down with them and wake up with them and sit with them.
[time=2279] Bind them on your foreheads, Deuteronomy six, verses four to eight, that paints a picture and I hope you caught that, it paints a picture of a parent and a child spending a great deal of time together and not just a great deal of time but a great deal of intentional time, purposefully having time with, not getting separated by having time with so that conversations can take place so that questions can get asked, so that discussions can be had, so that concerns can be voiced, see kids, remember this and you may not, you may be sitting here today, kids going, come on Pastor Bird, you're killing me.
[time=2319] I mean, I like my parents and all, but now here you are talking about more time spent with my parents and I understand that naturally, there's this thing in you that wants to sort of kind of start to establish yourself and believe me, your mom and dad are aware of that and they're gonna try their best to honor that journey but I'll tell you what, you need them.
[time=2340] They by God's design are to set direction for you.
[time=2347] They by God's design are to discipline you.
[time=2352] They, mom and dad, by God's design are to celebrate your victories.
[time=2357] They by God's design are to live in close relationship
[time=2363] with you, a relationship built upon, a relationship centered around truth of God's word and the person of Christ
[time=2373] and his work in you.
[time=2375] Satan wants to distance you from that.
[time=2378] Here's a question for you.
[time=2380] On this point, I just want you to write this down.
[time=2382] Who or what?
[time=2383] Please be honest.
[time=2386] Please be honest with yourself.
[time=2388] Who or what is coming in between you and your kids?
[time=2393] And what are you ready to lovingly yet forthrightly
[time=2400] do about it?
[time=2401] Who or what is coming in between you and your kids and what are you willing today to do about that?
[time=2411] Reprogramming.
[time=2412] Number two, Nebuchadnezzar's evil plan, his hope to advance evil with these young Hebrew boys.
[time=2420] Secondly, it had to do with reprogramming these kids in their minds.
[time=2423] Remember their minds?
[time=2424] Remember the amazing thing about kids' minds?
[time=2427] How quick they are, how sharp they are.
[time=2430] He wanted to wipe out Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=2432] Did look at verse four.
[time=2436] Says in verse four, the end of verse four, and he ordered him to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
[time=2445] And then in verse five, at the end of five, he says, and appointed that they should be educated three years at the end of which they were to enter into the king's personal service.
[time=2456] Here's what Nebuchadnezzar wanted to do, gang.
[time=2459] He wanted to wipe out any hint of spiritual, moral, or ethical convictions.
[time=2464] They had been, they had been given so much already.
[time=2468] Daniel and these boys' scholars would tell us that they're probably in the 13, 14, 15-year-old range.
[time=2476] And through their parents and those that loved them, so much had been invested already.
[time=2481] They came from families who talked about it when they sat down and when they walked along the road and when they lied down and when they got up.
[time=2489] And a lot had been deposited.
[time=2492] Now he begins the process of brainwashing, erasing, and that's what Satan always wants, you guys.
[time=2499] He always wants truth to be set aside.
[time=2502] And Nebuchadnezzar goes about trying to fill their heads and their hearts with the current Babylonian philosophy of that day.
[time=2510] Nothing, my friends.
[time=2511] Absolutely nothing has changed.
[time=2514] Young people, the enemy today is trying to get you to view the truth.
[time=2518] Young people, the enemy is trying so hard to get you to view the truth as nothing more than a weak option.
[time=2527] Just one of many things out there.
[time=2530] And while you're at it, he'll tell you, it's not a very good option, it's a poor option.
[time=2534] And the way he's trying to reprogram your mind, your very capable mind, the way he's trying to reprogram you, the way he's trying to get you to move and think and choose in a different direction is simply, and I know this might sound a little cliche, it might sound as if I'm all of a sudden like a grandpa talking to you, but you know what?
[time=2554] It's just the truth.
[time=2555] He is trying to get into your mind by what you read, by what you watch and what you listen to.
[time=2561] If you wanna argue with me on that, argue with me.
[time=2565] But I'm right, and that's how it works.
[time=2571] He programmed, we get programmed.
[time=2574] Our minds get shaped and formed by what we read and what we watch and what we listen to.
[time=2581] And he is gonna do everything he can today for there to be as many options as there could be out there to steer you and me in the wrong direction based upon what we would read, watch and listen to.
[time=2596] Now, parents, I don't think the answer,
[time=2602] hear me on this, I don't think the answer then is for you and I to turn into reading, watching, listening, Gestapo's.
[time=2611] I don't think the answer is you and I walking up and down the hall at night with a bat going what are you listening to?
[time=2618] I don't think that's the ticket.
[time=2622] I think the ticket is twofold.
[time=2627] I think the ticket is Deuteronomy six.
[time=2629] See, I think this is a positive thing.
[time=2633] I think this is a great opportunity for you and I, and I've said this to you before, if you and I would take seriously, really, seriously and learn and be creative and be intentional with ways to do Deuteronomy six, four through eight with our families.
[time=2650] If we worked hard as moms and dads at setting a spiritual climate that was enjoyable and interactive and interesting, that was personal and built upon relationship, it wasn't rigid and it wasn't about rules and do's and don'ts, I mean it was about you and I making an investment of these values in their lives from the earliest of ages on, if we gave ourselves to Deuteronomy six, four through eight type living, then I believe most of the battle gets won because I believe their hearts get reached and I believe they start to desire things and want things and enjoy things.
[time=2693] Now watch, they're also kids and I think the second thing we've got to do is have boundaries and I hope I'm just reminding you, I hope I'm not informing you of something new here, the door shouldn't be closed.
[time=2706] What in the world, they shouldn't be out late,
[time=2712] the door shouldn't be closed, text messages should be read, I mean what are we, are you gonna hide something from me?
[time=2718] You're not hiding anything, are you?
[time=2721] Then let's just read it and let's just all be on the same page and let's just make sure that nothing's going on because here's the deal, who in the world said, I'd like to find the person that 13 and 14 and 15 year olds know how to handle all this and 13, 14, 15 year olds, that's not a knock on you, we love you, you're gifted, capable kids, but you're not able to handle all that he's bringing your way and all that's being offered.
[time=2749] That's why he gave you mom and dad and student ministry leaders and people that lead your small groups and teachers.
[time=2759] You need help deciphering what's good and what's healthy.
[time=2764] What is the one thing, question for you,
[time=2773] here's your take home on this one, what's the one thing?
[time=2775] And kids, I'm gonna ask you, you know what, I'm gonna trust you on this one kids, I'm gonna honestly ask you to answer this yourself, I'm not asking your mom and dad right now, I'm asking you, what is the one thing that you're listening to, reading or watching?
[time=2793] That the enemy is using to move your heart and your mind away
[time=2799] from what's right and true and good.
[time=2805] Parents, here's one for you, I think there should be a level of involvement and understanding on your part and mind and whether you like it or not, you know, I think you should know what the answer to that question is for them right now.
[time=2823] See, I think you should know what they're listening to, reading and watching and I think together with humility, the two of you should work together to move away from anything that would be as Nebuchadnezzar was trying to reprogram a mind that God intended to be used for him.
[time=2844] Thirdly, look what Nebuchadnezzar was up to here, impressing them, remember what we said about kids being impressionable, well boom, here it is, impressing them with his stuff, this was Nebuchadnezzar's evil plan, you see it right there, beginning of verse five, the king appointed for them, a daily ration from the king's choice food, these guys were in prison, these kids were in the dungeon, you guys, these kids, they weren't living in the palace, all right, these kids were being held captive, 1500 miles away from mom and dad and anything familiar and one day all of a sudden Aspenaz shows up with the platter full of steak and grapes and fruit and snickers and whatever they ate back then that they weren't allowed to eat back at home and he's like here, have it.
[time=2896] When they're going, whoa, I mean the biggest, juiciest steaks and the, and then he says in here and have some wine too, we get to have, trying to impress them, trying to wow them because you know what kids are loyal to those that wow them sometimes.
[time=2917] Hey kids, Satan, young people,
[time=2925] Satan is working overtime today to convince you
[time=2931] that money and pleasure and possessions will bring satisfaction, he is trying to wow you with the look of a life and the feel of an existence that would just be full of stuff and all the happiness and joy that comes with it.
[time=2951] And I just want you to, I just want you to remember what Solomon said in Ecclesiastes 2.
[time=2960] Ecclesiastes 2, my friends, you have a guy named Solomon
[time=2969] who literally, literally had it all.
[time=2973] And I want to remind you, Ecclesiastes 2, one to 11, I said to myself, come now, I will test you with pleasure.
[time=2980] See Solomon had all this money and all this wealth and he could basically give himself anything he wanted imagine that, I will test you with pleasure so enjoy yourself and behold he says it too was futility.
[time=2993] I said of laughter, it is madness and of pleasure, what does it accomplish?
[time=2997] I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely and how to take hold of folly, foolishness until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives.
[time=3012] I enlarged my works, I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for myself, I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees, I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees, I bought male and female slaves and I had home born slaves, also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem, also I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces, I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men, many concubines, he had over 700 women that he slept with, 700 and over 300 wives.
[time=3062] 'Cause somewhere in there he bought this lie, the mind got reprogrammed and he thought you could actually be fulfilled sexually outside of God's design.
[time=3073] Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem, my wisdom also stood by me, all that my eyes does, imagine this, all that my eyes desired, I did not refuse them, I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor, thus I considered all my activities, quite a few, which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted and behold, all was what, say it, translation for vanity is empty, say empty, all was what, did it fulfill?
[time=3120] No, all was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun.
[time=3128] What Solomon learned, many of us in this room today have learned and that is that right relationship with God satisfies the soul.
[time=3139] Amen?
[time=3141] 15 year olds, 17, 18 year olds, right relationship with God satisfies the soul and he will do his best to reprogram your mind to impress you with stuff, to separate you from your parents and from those who can give you a wise investment and I am begging you this morning to not let him.
[time=3167] One last thing there, number four, after impressing them with stuff, look at the screen, Nebuchadnezzar's evil plan required giving them a new identity, you know what he did there?
[time=3179] This was an amazing thing and for a moment it looks as if he won but watching the end he didn't, here's what he does, he changes their names, remember that, he changed their jerseys and he said here, you got a new jersey now and he changes their names and every one of their, if you study it you'll see this, every one of their Hebrew names was connected to Jehovah, to God, their parents had named them in ways that connected them, one of the names meant God's, Jehovah's servant, one of the names meant devoted to him and that all their names had to do with their love and their devotion to God, Nebuchadnezzar comes along, he changes all their names and every one of those names, Beltegezzar, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, all of those names were directly tied to Baal.
[time=3228] See he's cunning and he is so smart in his attempts to change who we are and what we believe and where we belong, so he gives these boys new names and they couldn't fight him, Daniel back in chapter one said no to the food and the wine, guts, gutsy kid.
[time=3251] He says no I'm not gonna do it, I'm gonna obey God.
[time=3254] I'm gonna find satisfaction in what's right.
[time=3256] On the name thing they take the names, they don't, I mean they just get called those names and so there's a sense where maybe you could see Nebuchadnezzar going okay good finally, I got him going in the right direction.
[time=3269] Till one day, in chapter three he says hey, I just built a 90 foot tall statue of myself and I want you three boys, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.
[time=3281] These boys whose names I changed and whose identities I shifted bow down to me when the music plays hit the dirt.
[time=3290] And what do these three boys with new names do?
[time=3294] They stand with conviction and with integrity
[time=3300] because he tried to change their name but he didn't really change their jersey, did he?
[time=3307] And I wanna say to you young people today, the greatest, the greatest time of your life, the most meaningful stuff you will ever experience is when you as a 15 year old, 12 year old, 18 year old is when you experience the unique and unbelievable privilege of living out your unique identity that God gave you.
[time=3331] He gave you gifts and he gave you talents and he gave you abilities and he gave you a heart and you're so capable and you're mentally beyond most of us.
[time=3340] And the greatest thrill you'll ever get is to in relationship with Christ, live out who you are and you're not an athlete and you're not smart and you're not pretty and you're not skinny and you're not any of that stuff.
[time=3358] See he tries to move you down identity road, you are a child of God gifted and empowered to be so very unique and special and I implore you, I beg you to give your heart and your mind and your soul to that.
[time=3375] Hey I want you to come back next week.
[time=3379] Next week we're gonna look specifically and again it might be, it's not gonna be too raw but we're gonna be real honest and we're gonna look at Satan's schemes, his plan of attack literally, specifically, what is he doing today to try and get into the hearts and minds of our kids and what can we as adults learn from that so that we can partner together with our kids in a way that makes a difference.
[time=3405] Thank you so much for being here.
[time=3406] Would you stand and let me just pray for us as we go.
[time=3417] Father God we are, we see video clips like we did today and we see pictures of a boy chained to a bed
[time=3428] and the thought of the enemy and all that he's up to and all that he really is capable of.
[time=3433] It can be in some ways a bit fearful.
[time=3437] Now it can bring great concern and while that's appropriate I believe to a degree, I just pray that every person in this room would realize walking out of this place today that in relationship with you Lord, in a fully surrendered heart and life that's giving itself fully to walking with you and honoring you and trying to please you and understand your will.
[time=3465] God with parents who would give themselves to a Deuteronomy six approach.
[time=3469] God there is great comfort and there is great peace and there is protection.
[time=3474] God we know that we cannot this side of heaven.
[time=3477] We cannot guarantee anything.
[time=3481] We know there will be troubles and we know there will be trials and we know that we will walk through many of those with our kids.
[time=3489] But God I pray that in these weeks to come that you would build into us a mindset and a heart that would allow us to love and parent our kids in such a way that we could stand with them and for them that we could stand united instead of separated that we could stand God in a way that would express our deep love for you and each other.
[time=3509] God be with us as we go.
[time=3512] I pray that we would be honest.
[time=3514] As parents and kids in our evaluation of these questions I pray God that if there's anybody in the room who needs help, if there's anybody in the room this morning who's hurting, if there's somebody who we could encourage along these lines that I pray God you'd bring them forward and let us meet with them and talk with them and all the people agreed and said amen.
