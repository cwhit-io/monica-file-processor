[time=30] Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in Heaven
[time=56] and on Earth.
[time=63] Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=69] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=79] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=85] end of the age, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=100] "Why should I gain from His reward, I can not give an answer, but this I know with all
[time=120] my heart, if wounds have paid my ransom?"
[time=145] Hi I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Blackhawk and I am so thankful that you've joined us again for the broadcast.
[time=151] I've told you this before and I want to tell you again how very grateful I am to be a part
[time=157] of a community in which God has strategically placed so many really, really good churches
[time=164] with some really great people doing their very best with God's help, to have ministries
[time=170] that would bring great glory to God here in this city.
[time=173] And I'm so thankful that on the Bible Hour we've just made a commitment in recent years to tell as many of you that we can about these ministries, and today I am so thankful to
[time=185] have a good friend and Senior Pastor at one of these churches with us today, and I want to welcome Pastor Bill Campbell, my good friend, hey buddy, all you're welcome.
[time=195] It's good to see you and good to be with you.
[time=197] This is Bill Campbell, and Bill is the Senior Pastor at LifeBridge Church, and I've gotten
[time=203] a Nobel over the last, I would say, two to three years, and in that time have grown to
[time=209] respect him immensely, and I so appreciate what he and his team at LifeBridge are doing
[time=215] over on the northwest side of town.
[time=218] And as most of you know, if you've watched in the past, what we like to do is just have these guys come and talk about their ministry, and to share with you what God's doing in that ministry, many of you may even live near these guys.
[time=232] Maybe this would be an opportunity for you to connect with a local church right in your own backyard.
[time=238] Maybe it's not, but maybe just hearing about what God's doing would allow you to pray for them, and to support them, and to be for what God is doing through LifeBridge.
[time=248] So I'm really thankful, Bill, that you came today, and I want to just give you a chance to share with the people, maybe the mission at LifeBridge, what you guys are about, what
[time=258] God's doing in that ministry, and especially tell them about the new site, the new building
[time=265] that He has given you guys, and then I know you're excited about.
[time=268] So anyway, thanks for being here and share with the people about LifeBridge.
[time=272] Great.
[time=273] Well, thank you for inviting me to be a part of this today.
[time=275] It's wonderful privilege, and it is exciting what God is doing in LifeBridge, and the opportunity we've been given to share in ministry in the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=285] And if you were to sum up, what is our mission, what is our purpose, what is our vision of what we're trying to accomplish, probably in one sentence, I would simply say it is connecting in Christ to God, to each other, and to the world.
[time=297] And we believe that a church should be relational, because Jesus came relationally related here
[time=303] on earth to 12 disciples who then begin to relate to other people and change their world.
[time=309] And so we believe that as people begin to share together in relationship with one another,
[time=315] and then as we reach out to the world through relationship, we'll see lives changed and impacted eternally.
[time=321] And so it's exciting to be a part of a church where the people have that vision.
[time=325] It's not just my vision, it's the vision of the entire church.
[time=329] And we've been on an interesting journey.
[time=331] We've spent the last several months meeting in a school and setting up and tearing down ever Sunday, and so we're all very excited about our new building that's going up at the corner of Union Chapel and Corbin Road.
[time=344] And in the next few months, we will be in that building, and it will give us a wonderful place that we can have what I really say to our people as a distribution center.
[time=354] That really isn't the church.
[time=355] That's where we come and where we get equipped so that we can go back out, and the church can then impact the community that we're a part of, and not just in this community but around the world.
[time=365] We believe a church should be missional, that we need to be involved in meeting the needs of this city, but also to reach, and so we support missionary projects all over the
[time=375] world.
[time=376] We have people who go and hands on, get involved both locally and around the world.
[time=381] And at the same time, allow God to work in their lives to meet their needs, whatever stage of life they're in, whether they're married single, if they have children.
[time=389] We have activities for all ages, and all of them are set with a mindset of how can we
[time=395] be relational, how can we experience God and how can our lives be transformed for the
[time=401] sake of His Kingdom.
[time=403] That's awesome.
[time=404] That's really good.
[time=405] I know as Bill was talking, you all had a chance to just see the information at the bottom
[time=411] of the screen, the website, the phone number, ways that you could maybe learn more about LifeBridge.
[time=417] And Bill, you mentioned the new building, and I know you're hesitant to say a date, but you are hoping to be in by the end of the calendar year, somewhere in there.
[time=426] It'd be wonderful if we could be there by the end of the calendar year, or at least at the very first of 2007.
[time=431] But currently, you're meeting where?
[time=433] We meet at Perry Hill School, right on Co-Water Road, just north of Union Chapel, and then
[time=439] our children's ministries take place in Oakview School, which is just across the parking lot.
[time=443] Great.
[time=444] Thank you so much for being here, and thank you all again for tuning in.
[time=448] If you have any questions at all for Pastor Campbell or the LifeBridge team, give them a call, shoot them an email at the address below, and thank you again for tuning in today.
[time=458] God bless you, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=462] Well, welcome this morning to our second part of the series on kidnapped Satan's attempt to abduct our next generation, and we want to talk today about Satan's scheme, the actual
[time=473] plan of the enemy.
[time=475] And first, just get an idea of evil.
[time=479] There would be no such thing as evil if there were not good.
[time=483] Evil is the absence of good, and good is a derivative of the name God.
[time=489] And so evil, therefore, is life apart from God.
[time=492] If sin is desiring life apart from God, evil is experiencing that life apart from God.
[time=499] And after studying the Scriptures, Satan's scheme is really, really clear.
[time=509] And to kind of help you remember that and be able to walk out and remember for a long time, I think, I'm going to use a fishing analogy, and it comes a little bit from the type of words used in James 1.
[time=520] But how many people here have ever gone fishing?
[time=523] Raise your hand.
[time=524] Have you ever gone fishing?
[time=525] Raise them high?
[time=526] Have you ever gone fishing?
[time=527] Well, I remember-- How many have caught really big fish?
[time=531] Oh, my.
[time=532] There are a few.
[time=533] Did I tell you about the one that was gone?
[time=535] But it was between the eyes.
[time=537] You caught up between the eyes.
[time=539] Oh, that's what it was.
[time=540] I remember that when I was about four or five years old, my dad was a state senator, and
[time=546] you would go at that time, the way the legislature worked.
[time=548] You'd go to Indianapolis for a period of weeks, months, and I would stay, oftentimes, with
[time=556] my great grandparents, and they had a pond, and they'd take me fishing, and I remember the first time.
[time=562] It's really, really well.
[time=563] I remember getting that hook out and disguising the hook with the bait, and then the line,
[time=571] you know, is tied to the hook, and you got that thing called a sinker.
[time=575] Well this is Satan's scheme.
[time=580] This is the enemy's plan, and it also comes not just through seeing what Scripture tells
[time=586] us about it, but what the meanings of his name include, and the first thing is the bait.
[time=591] He's a tempter.
[time=592] So if you want to write it down, Satan is a tempter, and that's the bait.
[time=597] The bait is designed to attempt the desires of the fish or the prey.
[time=603] He's a tempter, and that in and of itself isn't sinned.
[time=606] Then there's this hook, and that's that Satan is a deceiver.
[time=611] Inside every bait, there's concealed a hook, deception, that it isn't, it doesn't satisfy
[time=618] like we thought it would, it dissatisfieds, and yet we're hooked, and because of the dissatisfaction of our desires, we repeat the same offense again and again.
[time=627] And then tied to the hook is the line, and that's when we catch the fish, we hold that
[time=633] line and we pull that fish out of the water and we say, "Hey, look," and that's symbolic of the fact that the devil is an accuser.
[time=640] Could also think about that in terms of the line that he uses to accuse the words, meaning
[time=646] the line that he uses to accuse us to ourselves and before God.
[time=652] And then finally, the sinker, hook, line, and sinker.
[time=655] What was designed to take the bait and the hook and the line down is designed to take us down, and that's the fact that Satan is a destroyer.
[time=664] His scheme for our children is, he's a tempter.
[time=668] He will bait them.
[time=670] He is a deceiver.
[time=671] He will hook them with the deception of dissatisfied desires after they pursue the bait.
[time=677] He will accuse them before God, others, and themselves.
[time=681] That's the line.
[time=683] And he is a destroyer.
[time=684] He has designed the whole plan to sink them because he is a defeated being.
[time=693] This is all the work of a loser.
[time=696] Hebrews 2, 14, and 15 says this, "Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared
[time=702] in their humanity so that by his death, Jesus, he might destroy him who holds the power of
[time=709] death." That is the devil, Diabolos, means to throw you off literally to throw through and free
[time=717] those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
[time=722] First John 3, 8 says it this way, powerful, powerful verse, "He who does what is sinful is of the devil because the devil has been sinning from the beginning." The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work.
[time=739] And so Steve and I talked and said, Steve said, "Is there a passage where it's focused
[time=748] to the children, to the teens?" We thought a little bit, and I said, "You know what, Proverbs 4 kind of struck me a different way, and that's where we're going to go today.
[time=759] I just had read it earlier and been thinking about it for a couple of weeks, and we're
[time=765] going to go to where Solomon tells us what his dad and mother told him when he was a
[time=773] little boy.
[time=774] And we're going to see that Satan's scheme to our children, this bait, this hook, the line and sinker, is targeted toward their heart, their mouth, their eyes, their feet,
[time=787] their heart, their mouth, their eyes, their feet.
[time=789] So if you want to stand, I want to read to you, Proverbs 4, we're going to start in verse 23, but to kind of set it up, I just want you to hear the first seven verses to know why we selected this passage.
[time=802] Proverbs 4, I'm going to start in verse 1, and then I'll jump down again to verse 23.
[time=807] "Listen, my sons, to a father's instruction, pay attention and gain understanding.
[time=812] I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching.
[time=815] When I was a boy in my father's house, still tender, and an only child of my mother, Bathsheba."
[time=823] He taught me and said, "Let hold of my words with all your heart.
[time=828] Leave my commands and you will live.
[time=830] Get wisdom.
[time=831] Get understanding.
[time=832] Do not forget my words or swear from them.
[time=835] Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you.
[time=839] Love her, and she will watch over you.
[time=841] Wisdom is supreme, therefore get wisdom, though it costs all you have.
[time=846] Get understanding.
[time=847] A steam her, and she will exalt you, embrace her, and she will honor you.
[time=850] She will set a garland of grace on your head and present you with the crown of splendor." That's what David told Solomon when he was a little boy, and Solomon continues with this, a very familiar verse.
[time=860] We're going to read verses 23 through 27 in chapter 4 of Proverbs, and this is our text for today.
[time=865] "Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.
[time=873] Put away perversity from your mouth, keep corrupt, talk far from your lips, let your
[time=879] eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you.
[time=886] Make level, make level paths for your feet, and take only ways that are firm.
[time=892] Do not swerve to the right or the left.
[time=895] Keep your foot from evil." Steve, you want to pray for us?
[time=900] Father in heaven, listening to those people on that video, just caused me again to remember
[time=912] the fact that we're born into evil, and we want to pretend that it isn't.
[time=920] Lord, it was so hard for those people to say that evil is evil and that people do really
[time=927] evil things.
[time=928] But it's because in our sinfulness, Lord, in our flesh, we are naturally bent toward evil.
[time=939] And we need to understand that, so I pray that you would please help us this morning,
[time=947] help our young people to realize that they have fallen prey at birth, and will fall prey
[time=959] to him, the evil one, if they don't get wisdom, if they aren't connected to you.
[time=968] So I pray, Lord, please expose Satan's schemes, please, in Christ's name I pray, amen.
[time=976] You may be seated.
[time=978] Satan's scheme, bait, hook, line, and sinker, bait that he's the tempter, hook that he's
[time=985] the deceiver, line that he's the accuser, and sinker that he's the destroyer.
[time=991] And his first and foremost target is the heart, the mind will emotions in spirit of our children,
[time=998] the mind will emotions in spirit of our children.
[time=1001] There's 23 in 4 Proverbs, above all else, priority number one is to guard your heart.
[time=1010] For it is a wellspring of life.
[time=1012] Life occurs from the inside out.
[time=1019] And it's interesting, since the fall, I think God gave us four desires.
[time=1022] They're prior to the fall.
[time=1024] I think God created us with four desires at least.
[time=1026] This is just me now, getting this from Genesis.
[time=1029] And I think they're security, significance, control, and contentment.
[time=1035] Security, significance, control, and contentment.
[time=1037] Now, Genesis 821, as the second of the bookends around the flood, and they both say this.
[time=1045] God says this, "Every inclination of a person's heart from childhood is evil."
[time=1053] There's a bent since the first sin, and every child and every adult toward evil to pursuing
[time=1061] satisfaction of those desires apart from God.
[time=1065] So when we pursue inside each one of us, we'll pursue significance apart from God.
[time=1070] We feel insignificant.
[time=1072] And we go more and more down that road and feel more and more insignificant.
[time=1076] The more we pursue security apart from God, the more insecure we become.
[time=1081] And all our kids are walking around with that.
[time=1083] The more we pursue control apart from God, the more out of control our lives become, like it was said in the video.
[time=1091] The more we pursue contentment apart from God, the more discontent we become.
[time=1098] So as we pursue satisfaction of our desires in our heart, this inclination toward evil apart from God, the more dissatisfied we are.
[time=1104] And so that's why the bait to the heart is pride of life, 1 John 2 16.
[time=1111] It's the pride of life.
[time=1112] If you want to write it down, that's the bait.
[time=1114] It's this bait toward my heart to desire life apart from God.
[time=1120] Security, significance, control, contentment apart from God with my mind, will, emotions, and spirit, my heart.
[time=1126] And that's what the NIV calls boasting of what he has and does.
[time=1132] Does not come from the Father, but from the world.
[time=1136] This comes from the world.
[time=1138] And the first part of boasting of what I have and what I do comes from my heart.
[time=1146] And so our kids are walking around with this bent toward satisfying their desires apart from God.
[time=1152] And here comes this bait that Satan uses that says try it.
[time=1158] And I want to say this, you cannot be tempted by definition unless you know what's right.
[time=1166] By definition, you cannot be tempted unless you know what's right.
[time=1171] Otherwise there's no way, there's no way you can be tempted.
[time=1173] So even though there's this inclination toward evil, this is a Hebrew idea, there is also
[time=1179] an inclination toward what's right and what's good.
[time=1184] The hook.
[time=1185] The hook is dissatisfied desires.
[time=1186] That's the deception.
[time=1187] The deceiver, the hook to the heart, is that my desires will not be satisfied.
[time=1192] They're dissatisfied when I actually sin and pursue the bait.
[time=1196] And so I'm hooked.
[time=1197] Here's what James 1 14 says.
[time=1199] But each one is tempted when by his own evil desire he is dragged away and enticed.
[time=1207] And it doesn't satisfy and I'm hooked and I do it again and again and again and that's what our kids are doing.
[time=1213] Well the line that the devil and his accusation is an accusary grabs that line, he lifts our
[time=1219] kids out of the water and he's got them hooked and he says look God, evil flowed from the
[time=1227] heart.
[time=1228] That's evil in their heart.
[time=1232] And here's what says in Matthew 12 35, Jesus said you know what, that's true.
[time=1237] The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him and the evil man brings up evil out of the evil stored up in him in his heart.
[time=1249] And then the sinker is that God hates that.
[time=1252] God hates a heart that devises wicked schemes, that devises life apart from God.
[time=1258] God hates that.
[time=1259] And so now you're in real trouble, you're sunk.
[time=1263] Because this is directly opposed to the heart of God, evil is the absence of life with God.
[time=1269] Evil is the absence of good, Proverbs 6, 18, Proverbs 6, 18, a heart that devises wicked
[time=1276] schemes and feet that are quick to rush into evil.
[time=1279] These are the things that the Lord hates, seven things that we see in Proverbs 6 that we're going to keep going back to and he hates a heart that devises life apart from God.
[time=1289] And it's in every one of our kids.
[time=1292] There's a girl that I've coached in basketball a little bit and she struggles and has been
[time=1298] open with me and some of her friends about her struggles of the desires of her heart, the inclination toward evil to life apart from God.
[time=1307] And so she struggles a little bit with being depressed and things like that.
[time=1310] We were sitting on a bench during a basketball game one of those rare times when we were up 60 to 10.
[time=1316] And I lean over to her and said, "Is it a good day or a bad day on the inside for you?"
[time=1323] And she told me that the day before had been kind of good and today was kind of bad and it's always a little bit of both.
[time=1330] And I said, "You know," and I called her by name, I said, "My concern for you is this,
[time=1336] that the desires of your heart that aren't being satisfied end up thinking that they'll
[time=1345] be satisfied with the first boy that comes along and shows you attention.
[time=1351] And you're going to get hooked by the bait and it's not going to satisfy because only
[time=1359] God can satisfy those desires." When the boy says, "I love you," he really believes it.
[time=1369] And therefore, she believes it.
[time=1371] He's deceiving himself because he doesn't know what love is.
[time=1374] He's talking about what he sees in romantic relationships on television and movies, what
[time=1380] he hears about from other people.
[time=1382] When he says, "I love you," he's deceiving himself into thinking that's true.
[time=1388] Because if he loved her, he'd give up anything that he wanted for himself to do what's best
[time=1396] for her.
[time=1399] But that's not what he means.
[time=1400] He means, "I love you," therefore, "I think we should." And girls, you know, up there, I want you to guard your heart.
[time=1411] Above all else, priority number one, that's what God says.
[time=1415] Guard your heart for it's a wellspring of life.
[time=1417] Your life will follow your heart's desires.
[time=1422] And if you think that guy's going to satisfy your desires, you're sorely mistaken.
[time=1425] I understand why.
[time=1427] Believe me, I understand why.
[time=1428] And guys, the same thing with you.
[time=1431] You may think that that quick satisfaction is going to somehow make your heart feel better.
[time=1436] And it's not.
[time=1437] You've got to be a whole person in Christ first.
[time=1439] Because, guys, listen to this.
[time=1441] This is very interesting to me.
[time=1443] Here's the heart that kind of comes to this equation.
[time=1446] These are statistics.
[time=1447] 28% of teens think viewing nudity is okay.
[time=1452] 49% of teens fantasize sexually about another, and they think that's okay.
[time=1458] 35% think having sex outside of marriage is okay, and 49% think living together is okay.
[time=1465] Oh, and by the way, those stats are for those who call themselves born again.
[time=1473] If not, you can double it.
[time=1475] 28% of our kids would struggle with thinking viewing nudity is okay, would fantasize sexually
[time=1482] about another, and that's probably okay.
[time=1484] 39%, 35% having sex outside of marriage is probably okay, 49% living together is probably
[time=1490] okay.
[time=1491] That's the heart that Satan is trying to use the bait, the hook, the line, and the sinker to say your desires, the bait, your desires will be satisfied.
[time=1500] Your heart will be made complete if you just pursue this.
[time=1503] This guy, this girl, whatever it is, something that you want to have and something that you want to do.
[time=1508] And the hook is that it's deception.
[time=1511] He's a deceiver, and the desires are dissatisfied, yet I'll do it again and again, thinking that I will be satisfied, and the line of the accuser.
[time=1520] He lifts you up out of the water and says, look, that evil flowed from your heart, and he's right, and that's the sinker because God hates a heart that desires evil.
[time=1532] But it's not just with the heart.
[time=1534] He also targets the mouth.
[time=1537] 24%, put away perversity from your mouth.
[time=1543] I like the fact that God chose to use that word, perversity.
[time=1548] I like to think about how perverted it is for us to use our mouths in ways that don't
[time=1557] glorify God and use other people.
[time=1561] It's perverted for us to speak in such a way that is to manipulate, use other people or
[time=1568] dishonor God.
[time=1571] Put away perversity from your mouth.
[time=1574] Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
[time=1579] You know, having been in education for 30 years, I watch students, typically from age
[time=1587] six to about 18, and I learned this, boys have a problem with their mouths all the time.
[time=1603] Girls are just awful in the eighth grade.
[time=1610] Boys are really mean in sharp tongue, they say, but in the eighth grade, there's nothing
[time=1618] more wicked than an eighth grade girl's tongue because in the eighth grade, you know, they
[time=1624] have a friend, and if somebody tries to be their friend's friend, girls go after them,
[time=1632] and they tell everybody why that person.
[time=1636] We've been promoting boys using their tongues for boasting.
[time=1644] Look at 1 John again, 216, boasting of what he has and does.
[time=1651] What he has and does is what Mitchell was talking about there, what we have and do, the pride of life.
[time=1656] Boasting about it is a wicked perverse use of our tongues, and Jeremiah says, "Let not
[time=1662] the wise man boast of his wisdom, nor the strong man boast of his strength, nor the rich man boast of his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this that he knows me, that
[time=1673] I am the Lord." Boasting about him is not a perverted use of your tongue, but boasting in any other form
[time=1684] is perversion, and we have to watch it.
[time=1689] We've been lifting up athletes as role models who use their tongues to boast about who it
[time=1696] is that they are and what they're able to do.
[time=1699] There was a time in our culture when that wasn't popular.
[time=1702] There was a time when humility was really lifted up and honored, but that's gone, and
[time=1708] now our star athletes, they don't talk much about teammates anymore or coaches, they talk
[time=1715] a lot about what they've done, what they've accomplished, and what they're going to do.
[time=1721] So that's the bait.
[time=1723] Yeah.
[time=1724] That you'll be able to boast about if you have this or do this.
[time=1726] Yeah.
[time=1727] The hook, then, is dissatisfied desires.
[time=1731] James 1-14.
[time=1733] Proverbs.
[time=1734] I'm sorry, did I point to the wrong verse?
[time=1737] Twenty-six.
[time=1738] Thank you.
[time=1739] That did throw them off a little bit.
[time=1740] Proverbs 26-22.
[time=1746] The words of a gossip are like choice morsels.
[time=1749] Now, I'll think about that.
[time=1752] They're choice morsels.
[time=1754] Both for the giver of the gossip and the receiver of the gossip, says they go down to
[time=1762] a man's inmost parts.
[time=1766] Gossip, it's natural for us to gossip about somebody else, to make us feel better about
[time=1772] who we are, and the person receiving the gossip, it makes them feel better about who
[time=1779] they are when you tell them about what's wrong with this other person.
[time=1785] It's a tasty morsel, and it goes down really easily, and it's as natural as can be for
[time=1793] our children to do that.
[time=1797] That's the hook.
[time=1800] The line, then, perverse speech is evil.
[time=1803] I love it that perversion comes up again.
[time=1806] Proverbs 8-13.
[time=1808] To fear the Lord is to hate evil, I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior, and perverse
[time=1816] speech.
[time=1817] God hates perverted speech.
[time=1820] Again, I'll tell you my definition for perverted speech.
[time=1823] Any speech that is dishonoring to God or manipulative to use other people, any speech
[time=1833] of that type is perverted use of speech.
[time=1837] The problem is we can't help it.
[time=1842] In James 3 it says, "No man can tame the tongue."
[time=1848] It's as natural for me to gossip and be perverted in my speech as anything I do.
[time=1854] Fortunately, a fruit of the Holy Spirit is self-control, but I can't control my tongue.
[time=1862] It's a line.
[time=1864] It accuses over and over and over again, because it does happen over and over again.
[time=1871] I ask you this first hour, it hit me, but I've noticed it auctions among kids and churches,
[time=1877] whatever it is, a person who has a tendency to accuse.
[time=1881] Don't you think they're doing something similar to what that, which they're accusing, kind of like the devil's accusing, but he does the same behavior?
[time=1891] Don't you think that that happens in our relationships a little bit or in people when they accuse they're actually doing something similar?
[time=1896] I don't know how similar it is, but I know it's similar in the fact that it is in sin, it is their own weakness that they're trying to lift up somebody else's weakness so they
[time=1907] can be weak and sinful in their own way and still feel okay about themselves as long as
[time=1913] somebody else is worse.
[time=1914] That's powerful.
[time=1916] Well, the thinker, God hates, lies, deceit, flattery, and boasting all through the Scripture.
[time=1925] We know that's true.
[time=1926] Look at Proverbs 6, verses 17 and 19, "Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent
[time=1934] blood." These are what God hates, what he detests, "a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among his brothers." It's incredible.
[time=1943] Three of the seven things that God says he hates and detests are about our tongue.
[time=1950] They're about us speaking in such a way that it doesn't honor God and it uses people.
[time=1960] It's amazing.
[time=1961] This Satan targets our heart and that's so linked to our mouths and so he targets what
[time=1967] comes out of our mouths, but he also targets our eyes.
[time=1972] Look at our kid's eyes.
[time=1974] Look at Proverbs 4, 25.
[time=1978] Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you.
[time=1986] Look at what the bait is.
[time=1987] The bait, if you want to fill it in here on the eyes, is lust of the eyes.
[time=1990] It's looking and seeing something that I might like to have to do to enjoy.
[time=2000] And no matter what kind of satisfaction I've had up to that point, the lust of the eyes
[time=2006] that it talks about in 1 John 2, 16, this desiring life apart from God with my eyes.
[time=2013] That's how he's going to tempt me and the temptation's not sinned, but here it comes, the hook is the dissatisfied desires.
[time=2020] No matter how satisfied or dissatisfied I am with my eyes.
[time=2025] The eyes are never satisfied.
[time=2027] Proverbs 27, 20 says, no matter what's happened.
[time=2030] A friend of mine, let me use his new Corvette for a weekend not long ago.
[time=2035] It's really pretty too.
[time=2036] I mean, it's that red color that I like.
[time=2039] And I drove a Del Cart and it's a 2006 vet and I was really into it.
[time=2047] And I put my sunglasses on about halfway there because I realized I needed sunglasses on.
[time=2050] It was cloudy, but I needed them to drive that car.
[time=2055] And...
[time=2056] Man, you're looking good.
[time=2057] I was, yeah.
[time=2058] And well, as good as I can look.
[time=2063] On the way home, I realized about halfway home, I hadn't thought about what I was being transported
[time=2073] in.
[time=2074] I thought about it a lot on the way up there.
[time=2078] On the way home, it had already lost its appeal.
[time=2081] Really?
[time=2082] Yes.
[time=2083] And I was just thinking about life.
[time=2088] Would have taken a little longer for you, huh?
[time=2089] I wonder if I made a living on the left of the eyes.
[time=2092] I think he said he wondered if he made a living on the left of the eye.
[time=2096] Absolutely.
[time=2097] He did sell on his car.
[time=2100] That is really interesting.
[time=2101] And that's true.
[time=2102] It is true.
[time=2104] Every guy'd sell a car too.
[time=2106] He'd want another one, which is beautiful in a certain way.
[time=2110] Proverbs 27-20 says, "Lost of the eyes are never satisfied.
[time=2115] The eyes of man are never satisfied." Says the same thing in 1 John 2, 17.
[time=2119] The verse right after all these areas where we're getting these debate and the temptation, it says, "The world and its desires pass away," is that they're going to pass away.
[time=2131] They don't satisfy.
[time=2134] And the line, the accusation, is that evil entered the eyes.
[time=2140] And Jesus said in Matthew 528 that the eyes and the heart are inextricably linked.
[time=2146] He said, "If you looked at a woman lustfully, you've already committed adultery in your heart." But you know Proverbs 625 kind of talks a little bit more about the girl's contribution to the eyes.
[time=2159] And I've been around girls.
[time=2160] I've heard him say, "Look at that guy with the gray hair and the sunglasses and that new Corvette.
[time=2168] He's looking good." But here's what girls do with their eyes, they kind of do this.
[time=2180] Girls, the women are laughing because I know you know you're evil on how you do this.
[time=2184] And I talked to this about this a couple of months ago, but let me try it again.
[time=2189] It's scary how good he is at that.
[time=2194] That word perverted a little bit ago, that's what comes to my mind there.
[time=2198] So Proverbs 625 in sign language is this, "Do not lust in your heart after her beauty
[time=2210] or let her captivate you with her eyes." And so the devil accuses.
[time=2219] And the sinker is that God hates haughty eyes, God hates eyes that desire evil, the desire
[time=2229] life apart from him, Proverbs 617, Proverbs 617 says, "God hates haughty eyes."
[time=2239] Well this is the target to our kids' eyes.
[time=2242] And I think one of the most significant applications of this bait, of the temptation, he's the temper of the hook, he's the deceiver of the line, he's the accuser, and of the sinker,
[time=2254] he's the destroyer.
[time=2255] This is all about destroying our kids and the relationship with God and each other.
[time=2260] I think one of the most important applications here is a thing called Myspace.com, Myspace.com.
[time=2268] In 24 months, Myspace.com has gone from zero users to 50 million teenagers.
[time=2278] Why don't you stand up up there in the balcony if you've got a Myspace space?
[time=2282] Go ahead and stand up.
[time=2285] Stand up, tall.
[time=2288] Now I want you to look at all those kids sitting down because that's what someone in denial looks like.
[time=2293] [laughter] Okay, thank you.
[time=2295] Sit down.
[time=2296] Virtually every teenager in the United States has Myspace.com.
[time=2304] It's a website designed to link kids socially, but there's come some danger with that.
[time=2312] And it's so interesting that I'm talking about this this week and last night, my oldest daughter
[time=2318] who's 16 calls me from a friend's house and asks me, "Daddy, can I do a Myspace page?"
[time=2329] And I couldn't believe us.
[time=2330] Is this part of like the tent?
[time=2331] Is it going on with me?
[time=2332] What I'm preaching about?
[time=2333] Another tent in me?
[time=2334] You know what's going on?
[time=2335] And I said, "You know, we've talked about this before, but there are at least three things that are going to happen.
[time=2340] And you might want to write these three things down if I can remember what I told her.
[time=2343] Because there are three things that I think have to happen if you're going to allow your kid to do this.
[time=2348] The first one is that you will not connect, this is Eric told me this, you will not connect
[time=2357] the real world with the internet world.
[time=2359] You will not put your address, you will not put your phone number, you will not put anything about you on there that anyone could find you that will not happen.
[time=2371] Number two, only those you allow will be able to find you.
[time=2375] I will not have it be where anybody can communicate with you.
[time=2379] It will only be those that you allow and I'm to say on that.
[time=2382] There is a method to do that.
[time=2385] I just found out, Eric, that there is a way to do that.
[time=2388] And I told her if she came home, she better be able to show me, I'll prove that to me.
[time=2391] And then I said, "The third thing is this, you better know how to shut it down." What?
[time=2397] She said.
[time=2398] I said, "Don't start it until you know and can tell me how to end it.
[time=2404] Because there's going to be a time when I'm going to want to shut it down or you're going to want to shut it down and we're going to know how before we start.
[time=2410] So I'd want you to do those three things with your kids when it comes to MySpace.com.
[time=2414] Don't let them connect the real world with the internet world.
[time=2416] Don't let them put addresses, phone numbers, anything about them that people are going to be able to find them.
[time=2421] Number two, what was number two?
[time=2427] What was it?
[time=2428] It will only allow those who your parents and you allow to communicate with you.
[time=2433] And then what was number three?
[time=2435] Shut it down.
[time=2436] Know how to shut it down.
[time=2437] See, I think those things are really important.
[time=2438] If I can remember them, I'll do that.
[time=2442] And guess what?
[time=2444] This has become a praying ground for sexual predators.
[time=2450] You've seen it in the news.
[time=2451] I mean, how many people raise your hand if you've seen one of some of the news stories?
[time=2454] Let me tell you something, people.
[time=2456] Folks are bustin' adults right here in Allen County who are praying after our 13, 14, 15-year-old
[time=2464] boys and girls.
[time=2466] Because they go online in the cops do and portray to be the 13 or 14 or 15-year-old girl or guy.
[time=2471] And it's amazing, business guys.
[time=2476] People with big reputations, positive ones, are praying on children on MySpace.com.
[time=2485] The other one for college kids is Facebook.com, Facebook.com.
[time=2492] I was with a few college kids who were freshmen Friday night.
[time=2497] Every single one.
[time=2498] In fact, their eyes lit up.
[time=2499] "Yeah, I got Facebook.
[time=2500] I got Facebook." Well, it started by an undergrad student at Harvard.
[time=2503] This is amazing.
[time=2505] Less than 24 months ago, 6 million college students from hundreds of campuses across the country now have a site at Facebook.com.
[time=2515] And it's growing by 10 to 20,000 college students a day.
[time=2522] It's amazing.
[time=2524] Same thing.
[time=2526] You know, I had really good advice.
[time=2527] I was asking an expert about some of this stuff yesterday.
[time=2530] I had really good advice and the line goes this way.
[time=2533] You got to tell your college student and your high school kids don't ever put anything on a MySpace or a Facebook that you don't want a prospective employer to see because they're looking.
[time=2546] They are looking.
[time=2548] And if you're talking about your partying and what you did and how you did and all that kind of thing, you're kissing your career goodbye.
[time=2557] It's amazing.
[time=2558] It is absolutely amazing.
[time=2560] So the eyes are dangerous.
[time=2562] You know, there's suicides going on among teenagers right now because they bring that broken heart.
[time=2569] They bring those, the eyes that are being tempted, baited, and deceived to every situation.
[time=2575] A really attractive student just committed suicide in this county in the last couple of weeks.
[time=2581] I was asking an expert about this.
[time=2583] And he said, you know, it's not the low social economic people who are teenagers who are committing suicide.
[time=2589] It's the ones that have the bar so high.
[time=2591] It's the good students.
[time=2593] It's the good athletes.
[time=2595] It's all because of this inclination toward evil and the dissatisfaction of the desires
[time=2601] of their heart because they're hooked and they're accused and no, maybe they're not
[time=2607] cutting it.
[time=2608] There's evil there.
[time=2611] And finally, he gets to them and they destroy their lives.
[time=2615] That's all because he did it.
[time=2618] Any tool, any social tool has potential for good and evil.
[time=2626] The tools are all on moral.
[time=2628] The Internet's on moral.
[time=2630] The MySpace is on moral.
[time=2632] Any tool has potential for good or evil.
[time=2635] The problem with this one is the scope, the scope is so large.
[time=2643] The potential for evil is so great.
[time=2648] You need to be aware of it.
[time=2650] We need to pray about it and be really wise.
[time=2653] The computer expert came up to me in between services and said, you know what, I'll design a class.
[time=2658] He's an elder of the church.
[time=2659] He goes, I'll design a class and I'll put together a 50-minute presentation for everybody at Black Hawk to know how to do everything we just talked about with your kids on the Internet.
[time=2669] That'd be great.
[time=2670] Well, just one more thing on the left of the eyes.
[time=2672] I just want you to realize, boys and girls, both.
[time=2675] Young men, young women, both are both lusting and the objects of lust, both.
[time=2684] And I used to talk about the clothes that girls wear, you know, I did that for years, but now it's the clothes that boys and girls wear, advertisements that take advantage of young men looking sensual, incredible, what that's doing to our young people.
[time=2700] Tell them what Bob told us.
[time=2701] Yeah.
[time=2702] Bob told us, he said, he heard from a guy this week, that when it comes to clothing, he said clothing either accentuates the face because it doesn't accentuate the body.
[time=2715] We naturally go to the face or accentuates the body.
[time=2719] And he said, "Run real easy thing to do is just to make sure that you wear clothing that accentuates your face." I like that.
[time=2729] That's simple.
[time=2730] Well, in addition, Proverbs 4, 26, and 27, in addition, Satan's prey is a child's feet.
[time=2741] 26, make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm.
[time=2748] Do not swerve to the right or the left, keep your foot from evil.
[time=2753] Our feet naturally run toward evil.
[time=2759] Sometimes it's with others, sometimes we run away from others in order to be evil alone.
[time=2766] It goes both ways.
[time=2770] The bait here is again the lust of the flesh, 1 John 2, 16 again.
[time=2778] For everything in the world, the cravings of simple man, the lust of his eye, the cravings of sinful man.
[time=2788] We lust after what people have.
[time=2791] We lust after what the advertisers tell us we should have.
[time=2796] We lust after the people that bring us pleasure for a time.
[time=2800] We have a natural propensity for lusting, the lust of our flesh.
[time=2805] That's the bait.
[time=2806] And he has it out there for us and it is available in so many forms and in so many locations.
[time=2814] You can't avoid it.
[time=2817] He is out to get you and keep you.
[time=2825] The hook.
[time=2826] Go ahead.
[time=2827] Well you think the bait is like food.
[time=2828] I kind of think it would be something as simple as food or not doing the food thing.
[time=2833] Alcohol, drugs, sex, whatever is going to, wherever my feet can take my body.
[time=2838] Yes.
[time=2839] And my hands.
[time=2840] Now when we think about typing in, we go to virtual places, you know.
[time=2845] We used to have to go to physical places.
[time=2847] Now we go to virtual places with our fingers and it's so enticing.
[time=2856] It is so enticing and as adults, as church leaders, as parents, we haven't done a good
[time=2866] job protecting our children and part of the reason is that we're ignorant and it would
[time=2873] take work on our part to become educated enough to help them avoid the pitfalls that are out
[time=2882] there.
[time=2883] I challenge you.
[time=2884] Next week you'll hear more about that.
[time=2885] I challenge you to be educated because the tool is not evil.
[time=2891] The use of the tool is evil.
[time=2894] The hook that has dissatisfied desires, Proverbs 5-5, dissatisfied desires.
[time=2900] Her feet go down to death, her steps lead straight to the grave.
[time=2905] Here we're talking about evil, evil, the adulter, the evil person.
[time=2910] Their steps go down to the grave.
[time=2916] The line, quick to rush into evil.
[time=2920] Look at that, Proverbs 1-16.
[time=2924] For their feet rush into sin, they are swift to shed blood.
[time=2929] It's really fascinating when you look through the Scripture to see how many times something about fast, swift, rush goes with our heading into sin.
[time=2939] It's not like we slowly just kind of, we run after that stuff or like I said, run away
[time=2946] from people so we can do that evil on our own.
[time=2952] He says, "Gotcha." The sinker.
[time=2958] Well, we go back to Proverbs 6, "God hates feet that rush into evil."
[time=2965] Look at Proverbs 6 again, verse 18, "A heart that devises wicked schemes and feet that
[time=2972] are quick to rush into evil." God hates feet that are quick to run into evil.
[time=2982] How does he feel about it?
[time=2983] He hates it.
[time=2986] He detests it.
[time=2990] He wants us to understand that.
[time=2992] Satan, though, he's going to tell you, "Nah, it's not that bad."
[time=2999] It might not be so good, but it's not that bad.
[time=3001] One of the things I heard on the video there when a guy said, he said, "Evil is what people
[time=3010] do when they have some chemical problems in their mind." Another guy said, "Evil is what sometimes good people do."
[time=3021] And then he said, "And then he couldn't say evil people.
[time=3024] He said, "And then not so good people." Now hear this, "You're evil."
[time=3034] The Bible says, "We're born into iniquity.
[time=3038] The only way out is in Christ."
[time=3044] And then when we do things his way, we can do some good things by Christ doing them through
[time=3050] us.
[time=3051] There's no other way.
[time=3054] You are wicked.
[time=3055] You are evil.
[time=3057] You're born into that condition.
[time=3061] The Bible's clear there.
[time=3065] God hates feet that rush into evil.
[time=3066] I don't want to be what God hates.
[time=3075] And like I said, I don't think we've done our job protecting the next generation.
[time=3081] And we need to do that.
[time=3082] Mitchell, do the conclusion there, bait, hook, line, and sinker, then I'll do this.
[time=3089] Well, the scheme of Satan, Satan's scheme, his plan is the bait he's a tempter.
[time=3104] And inside every bait there's a hook and he's a deceiver and her desires will be dissatisfied
[time=3110] with that sin.
[time=3112] And then the line, he lifts us up out of the water, our kids up out of the water and he accuses us.
[time=3117] It's a line of the accuser.
[time=3118] And he says, look at the evil that's resident in them.
[time=3123] And then the sinker, designed to take the bait, the line, and the hook down is designed
[time=3129] to take our kids down.
[time=3133] But there's hope.
[time=3134] And I want you to write this down.
[time=3137] It just dawned on me as I was sitting there looking at this outline and feeling a little depressed.
[time=3142] I really think God spoke to me and this is what he said.
[time=3146] You know, a kid, when the bait's there and he's tempted, Christ always provides a way
[time=3153] out.
[time=3154] First Corinthians 10, 13.
[time=3156] Christ always provides a way out when tempted.
[time=3159] The hook when deceived.
[time=3161] When our kids are deceived, Christ, they need to know that Christ is the wisdom and the power of God.
[time=3167] So they don't have to be deceived.
[time=3168] First Corinthians 1, 24.
[time=3171] And accused, when hooked, and that line is pulled up out of the water and accused before
[time=3177] God and accused themselves and accused before others, they need to know that Christ intercedes
[time=3183] on our behalf.
[time=3185] That's Romans 8, 34.
[time=3187] And the sinker, when destroyed, they need to know that Christ defeated evil.
[time=3193] Hebrews 2, 14, and 15, and 1 John 3, 8.
[time=3198] I read this on the 16th and it was amazing to me how it pertained to this whole thing.
[time=3206] 16, 6.
[time=3208] Through love and faithfulness, sin is atoned for.
[time=3211] Through the fear of the Lord, a man avoids evil.
[time=3215] Hmm.
[time=3216] There's hope.
[time=3217] You'll hear more hope next week and some challenge to us in the generation that's older.
[time=3223] As the team comes up, we're going to see another song.
[time=3225] As the team comes up, I just want to close with something that I thought about this week and wrote down.
[time=3232] I want to ask you please to pay attention to this that I'm reading while they're getting ready.
[time=3240] I have watched our children, including my own, become older and older at younger and
[time=3251] younger ages.
[time=3255] Satan wants them to experience independence.
[time=3260] Our culture values independence.
[time=3265] We support him in that.
[time=3269] Satan wants our children to experience independence as early as possible.
[time=3277] Parents are God's instrument of protection for our children.
[time=3285] Next week you're going to hear how to do that.
[time=3288] They're going to sing.
[time=3296] Steph's going to start.
[time=3298] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=3300] And that really is the only hope.
[time=3304] And I've been listening to this song literally probably 300 times in the last few weeks because it was sung at my uncle's funeral, the one who invested so much in my life and just as they sang, so beautifully, I might add, I would ask that you would just ask Christ
[time=3319] to be who you need Him to be in your parenting journey or if you're a teenager in your journey
[time=3326] right now that He would speak to you, that He would be the answer to the satisfaction
[time=3334] of your desires.
[time=3360] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=3383] And the things of earth will grow strangely dead in the light of His glory and grace.
[time=3413] Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His wonderful face.
[time=3429] And the things of earth will grow strangely dead in the light of His glory.
[time=3473] Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His wonderful face.
[time=3500] And the things of earth will grow strangely dead in the light of His glory and grace.
