[time=599] What a privilege we get each and every week to be here and to have seasons of worship like that, opportunities to sing and to lift our voices and our praise and our thanks and I'm so grateful.
[time=611] I know all of you are for the time and the effort that Corbin and the team, the technical folks, everybody involved gives to preparing for these times and I'm so thankful to get to be here with you this morning and I'm so thankful for this series that we find ourselves right in the midst of
[time=628] I'm so I'm a little bit I'm thinking about today and I'm thinking about next week and I got to tell you I feel as if in my heart down deep in my gut I feel as if these next two messages in this series that we've entitled kidnapped
[time=644] Satan's attempt to abduct our next generation. There's just something in me that feels as if these next two weeks are maybe the most important messages I've ever thought through.
[time=657] I see what the enemy's doing. I see what he attempts to do with me and I see what he's trying to do with you. I see especially his efforts toward our kids and I just we felt like several weeks ago we just felt like we should take this time in these
[time=676] weeks to try and give attention to some things to try and talk about and teach about some truths that might encourage you that might give you strength and courage to face all that you and I are facing in these days.
[time=688] And as I think about today's message and as I think about next weeks I just want to ask you to pray pray for us and pray for these times together. I think it could be really really significant. Today's message we've entitled purposeful parenting purposeful parenting in a pleasure driven world.
[time=708] And I use that phrase pleasure driven because my friends it doesn't take me standing here and telling you this for you to I think realize that the enemy is using pleasure with our kids.
[time=721] He is using pleasure self seeking gratification with them he's using it with you he tries to use it with me he's using that everywhere you look there is this rush and this demand and this push for pleasure I want to feel what I want to feel good.
[time=740] And you and I need to be reminded of good solid life giving principles that can help us parent our kids in the midst of a pleasure driven world.
[time=753] So important my friends remember remember week one our impressionable kids they are so impressionable and they will watch and they will listen to and they will observe and they will take in everything you and I do and don't do.
[time=770] Everything we do and don't do they will take in it will mold them it will shape them it will stay with them and so the stakes are very very high.
[time=780] And with the enemies sites set directly on the hearts and souls of our kids I want to talk to you this morning I want to invite you into a very honest discussion about parenting in a pleasure driven world.
[time=793] And here's how I want to start this I want to just ask you to just I'm going to just give you the message in three statements and we're going to just kind of break down these three statements.
[time=802] But this morning if you'll remember these three statements it'll kind of give you something to hang all this on and I want to have a friend come and join me as I do this and I think there she is.
[time=813] Come here little one this is not mine this is little Maya this is Corbin and Tanya's little little Maya Miller and she's going to hang out with me here for just a few moments.
[time=830] Here's what I want you to think about this morning as we jump into this discussion about parenting.
[time=838] And I want you to say this back to me I'm going to say a phrase and I want you to say it back to me and I want you to say it loud.
[time=843] Alright we're going to just give you these three statements here you go start early that was a little weak.
[time=853] Start early start late start over start early start late start over.
[time=868] Those three things right there we're going to look at that and I want to just encourage you to think this through with me now on the on the start early front you might want to just write that down point number one start early.
[time=882] I am absolutely convinced you may not be alright it's okay if you're not.
[time=888] I am absolutely convinced that so much of the struggle so much of the heartbreaking stuff that we're wrestling with and that we're bumping into with our 14 and 15 and 16 year olds.
[time=907] Begin or began right here.
[time=914] I believe that with all my heart I believe that what takes place or what took place right here has a lot to do has a lot to do with how that heart and that soul and that mind got shaped.
[time=929] And I want to just talk to you for a little bit about starting early and I want to kind of as I think about and as we talk about starting early I want to just break down starting early into a couple different age ranges now listen to me folks.
[time=941] I stand here and I say these things to you and I'm willing to jump into this discussion with you but I do not do so as an expert I am still making mistakes on this front.
[time=953] I still have not got all this figured out but I've been learning a few things in 14 years of parenting.
[time=958] I got a lot more to learn but I want to just share with you some things that we've found and that we've seen and that others have loved us enough to tell us the truth about and so we're trying our best to implement these truths and I want to just share these things with you this morning.
[time=974] And I don't do it arrogantly. I do it lovingly and with great humility and the request that you'll give me grace as I continue to wrestle with these very truths myself in our own home and our own setting.
[time=988] Start early. Here we go. Age is zero to, oh we dropped the bunny. Age is zero to two. Write that down. There we go. Age is zero to two.
[time=1000] Now I want to say something about zero to two, all right. And this is one of the reasons why I got this precious little girl up here with me because she is so precious and I know I've held five of them and I know how precious they are and I know how sweet they can be.
[time=1015] I know how many times you waited years for one and I know how exciting it is to have them in your home and I understand the tendency in us to just want to make so much of them.
[time=1028] But I want to just say this to you and I want to say it lovingly and I hope you'll sense my heart. These precious gifts are to be and this is how I wrote it down.
[time=1037] They are to be loved and welcomed additions to your home, not the center of it.
[time=1048] Did you catch that? They are to be, I mean, you know, and it would be so easy. It would be so easy to have her be the center of the home.
[time=1069] And I understand that. But that's not the way God designed it. He designed them to be a welcomed addition to the home, not the center of it.
[time=1083] All right. All right. Let's go back to mom. All right. Here we go. Three statements. We don't have a lot of time and so thank you very much. Here's Bunny. There we go.
[time=1095] We don't have a lot of time so I'm going to just give you statements with each of these age bracket breakdowns. I'm just going to give you three statements, okay?
[time=1104] And I'll say a few things. If you have any questions, if you have any comments, if you have some disagreements, if there's some things you don't get, no problem, come talk to me afterwards and we'll talk.
[time=1114] Shoot me a note. I'll write you back. But just allow this to be a fodder for discussion and I hope an opportunity for you and I to grow.
[time=1121] Number one, under zero to two years old, with these welcomed additions that are not going to be the center of our homes, they should eat when you say it's time to eat.
[time=1133] They should eat. They got to eat, right? Right? They got to eat. They got to eat. And the way you can help them do this is they should eat when you say it's time to eat as opposed to when who says it.
[time=1148] They say, they should eat and not only should they eat when it's time to eat determined by you, the one who's in authority, the one who's been given them for guidance and direction.
[time=1160] Not only should they eat when you say it's time to eat because that's what families do. Families eat here and they eat there and they eat here and they're a welcomed addition.
[time=1169] Remember, not the center of. Not only should they eat when you say it's time to eat, I believe they should eat what you say. It's time to eat.
[time=1181] I think that for you and for them at this stage, zero to two, it's really, really important for you to give direction and for you to establish some routine.
[time=1192] On the feeding thing, you know, you can go to the books and you can look at secular parenting stuff and they'll talk about two choices, scheduled feeding and demand feeding.
[time=1203] I mean, just think about that word. Demand. Someone's demanding something right now.
[time=1211] Do you want that? Do you want demand? No, I think God's calling us to give these precious little ones some structure and an understanding that they're not calling the shots.
[time=1229] That God has given them some parents who are going to lovingly and faithfully do that for them. They should eat when you say it's time to eat. They should sleep.
[time=1238] These are challenging things. I know. These are things we have to work at. These are things that require a great deal of investment of time and effort and sacrifice.
[time=1248] They should sleep when you say it's time to sleep. And I'll add to that one too. I believe they should sleep where you tell them it's time to sleep.
[time=1260] Third, third one there and then I'll get to some comments. They should keep their hands off what you tell them not to touch. They shouldn't touch stuff. They shouldn't touch stuff that they shouldn't touch.
[time=1273] And where I go with that in my mind is this. I think of two things. I think of respect. When my kids or your kids, when any kid walks into somebody's house, there are things in that house that they didn't buy.
[time=1283] There are things in that house that they don't own. There are things in that house that other people bought that other people care deeply about.
[time=1290] And I don't want your kids or my kids walking around touching things because you and I know when kids touch things they break things.
[time=1298] And that's not respectful. And so they've got to be able to respond to a simple, "Hey buddy, don't touch that. There's got to be an ability to respond to that."
[time=1309] And an understanding that we, and you know, zero to two, the understanding's not going to get that broad, but it's the foundation of respect for other people and other people's stuff.
[time=1320] And you know what? Secondly, the no touch thing is just safety. Ovens get hot, right? Candles hurt. And you teach them to understand that you're looking out for them, that you're trying to protect them.
[time=1332] They begin to connect your request to not touch with a protecting sense and spirit. They should eat. When you say it's time to eat, they should sleep.
[time=1342] When you say it's time to sleep, they should keep their hands off what you tell them not to touch. Here's why, my friends, right here.
[time=1349] I believe, and I'm not an expert on a bunch of stuff. After 14 years at this, I feel like I can confidently stand here and tell you this emphatically.
[time=1358] Hands down, I believe this deep in my soul. I don't know if it makes me an expert on it, but I believe this deeply. Kids, zero to two, and even probably a little older than that.
[time=1368] They do not need, nor do they benefit from. In fact, it hurts them when you give them a plethora of options.
[time=1376] Little ones don't need a bunch of options. Little ones need order. Little ones need structure. Little ones need to begin to experience a sequence of schedule and routine.
[time=1394] Little hearts and minds. Physiologically, they can't handle options. They need you and I to lovingly bring some order to their life, and helping them understand that it is time to eat now, and it's time to sleep now, and you probably shouldn't touch that.
[time=1413] I know a bunch of other things. Here's the sad part. Have you ever seen a home ever been around in a situation? Have you ever struggled yourself with a kid, a little one, a precious little one who didn't know any better?
[time=1431] They just never got taught. Have you ever seen a home? A mom and a dad just run into the ground by a two-year-old who never got taught to eat at a certain time, or sleep at a certain time, or not touch?
[time=1448] It's absolutely heartbreaking, and it's not the little guy or the little girl's fault, and we have got to his parents understand that he gives this enormous opportunity and responsibility to bring order and direction with love, with some fun, yes, and with relationship absolutely, but he calls us to bring schedule and routine and order to their hearts and lives. Proverbs 1, 32, look what happens when we don't.
[time=1475] For the waywardness, you see that? For the waywardness of the naive, the naive, the one that didn't know any better, the one that had no context, the one that didn't really have a clue, the waywardness, they will go wayward, it'll kill them.
[time=1492] The waywardness of the naive will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. And it says in verse 33, "But he who listens to me," see God gives this privilege to speak into their hearts and lives.
[time=1507] And hopefully you're speaking, and hopefully I'm speaking what's true and right and good from God, and he says the one who listens shall live securely and will be at ease from the dread of what? Evil.
[time=1521] From the schemes of the evil one. Two to five years of age. Let's take it up a stage in life if we can. Two to five years of age, and these ages aren't concrete, my friends, I'm just trying to give you some context here.
[time=1535] Two to five years of age. They can begin to share toys. Why? Because we always, purposeful parenting and a pleasure driven world will want to early on help them always elevate who?
[time=1550] Others. We always want to be others centered. We always want to be willing to, in times where it's appropriate, take the back seat and let someone else be first in line.
[time=1564] We share toys. We give up a spot in line because we always want to just do whatever we can to elevate others. Right down Philippians 2, Paul said there have this attitude in you which was also in Christ.
[time=1578] He didn't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he gave himself up. He thought more highly of others than he did himself.
[time=1588] They share toys because we always try to elevate others. They start to complete small tasks. Now when I say small tasks, I'm not trying to be real complicated here. I'm just talking about picking up the room.
[time=1602] I'm talking about the beginnings of making a bed. I'm talking about toys being put back in a box. I'm talking about grabbing a shovel and following the dog around the backyard. Nothing too complicated here, but you start to give them small tasks.
[time=1617] Why? Because here's the deal because responsibility, the beginnings of responsibility. At age 5, I believe are the seeds of trustworthiness at age 10.
[time=1631] And I want for you and I want for me and our kids. And whether you're a parent, whether you're an aunt, uncle, big brother, sister, grandma, grandpa, coach, small group leader, anybody who gets to influence kids, we want them to be trust worthy.
[time=1646] And you begin to build that into them when you give them responsibilities early on. Two to five years of age, they learn to sit quietly. Watch this.
[time=1658] They learn to sit quietly. They can. They really can. They can learn to sit quietly in their room and look at books, play with toys or draw pictures.
[time=1668] Just look at that for a second. Quietly in their room looking at books, playing with toys or drawing pictures.
[time=1677] You know what I was thinking about when I wrote that down was the challenge that I have still to this day in my own life.
[time=1685] Whenever I hear someone teach on or whenever I'm reading through Psalms and I come to chapter 46 and I see that commandment that God gives me to be still.
[time=1698] To be still. To be quiet for a moment. To just shut it down. And to be with him and to be still. And to know that he is God.
[time=1714] And I just don't I don't think that that verse is just for eighteen and above.
[time=1719] And I feel like at times we do a great disservice because we've always got him on the go and they've always got to be doing something.
[time=1728] And I think there are opportunities for us to help instill in them an understanding that you know what it's okay for me to spend thirty minutes in my room quiet.
[time=1738] Just doing a few things. Unnoted and trusted author and pastor who most of you in the room would know and have great respect for said this recently.
[time=1752] I just had him put it on the screen. I see in today's youth the laziest most under disciplined over indulged and over entertained generation I've ever seen.
[time=1765] They've actually grown up to believe that every room and vehicle should have DVD capacity that earphones or headsets are a natural part of our human anatomy and that want truly determines need.
[time=1781] And then he says some hard words there but I think words that we need to consider and please parents make no mistake on this one he says.
[time=1789] It's our fault. These are the choices that we've made. This is the lifestyle that we've introduced. These are the decisions that we continue to put forth.
[time=1804] He went on to say we're setting up five year olds to feel more at home in front of screens than they are people.
[time=1813] Kids at a younger age and at an increased rate are unable to have basic and meaningful conversations.
[time=1823] Ages 5 to 12. A few more statements. Ages 5 to 12 and I would just for the record I would call 5 to 12. It's just my opinion and this is just from my own experience.
[time=1834] I would say 5 to 12 would be where the foundation really is getting completed. I know you may think that that's too soon but I would say to you I think 5 to 12 is where you see the foundation of this heart and soul and the way it's going to think
[time=1852] and the way it's going to respond and the stuff it's going to value. This is where we see that foundation being completed.
[time=1859] Alright a few statements here under 5 to 12 years of age. Here you go. Even when they don't like it. Even when they don't like it or don't want to do it.
[time=1870] They say yes mom when asked to do anything. Even when they don't like it and even when they don't want to do it they're willing to say yes mom or sure dad or I'd be happy to.
[time=1888] A willingness in them that we help them understand that we help give them a willingness in them to respond in a way that evidences their understanding that there is an authority in my life who loves me deeply who's asking me to be a part of something
[time=1905] bigger than myself that this world isn't just about me and what I want to do or feel like doing and they've asked me to do something and there must be some purpose there so I may not get it but I'm going to trust them because they're who they are and I'm going to respect them and say
[time=1920] alright I'll do it yes mom now so very important for two reasons I think number one spiritually obedience to parents most of you know this I think obedience to parents in tough times prepares them to obey who in tough times
[time=1940] say it God obedience to parents a willingness to go down that road even though you might not get it sound familiar even though it might not make sense sound familiar even though it might be kind of confusing a willingness to follow
[time=1957] in trusting submission prepares their hearts at age ten to follow and you know what at ten my goodness we're talking about the garbage at twenty two what are we talking about what decision are they going to need to make
[time=1975] what obedience are they going to need to evidence so spiritually obedience prepares kids to obey God and then just practically that's just a practical point that's just life life will be filled with opportunities for them to just say yes and do what they need to do when they don't feel like it it's just the way it is
[time=2001] sometimes you don't want to go to work sometimes you don't want to have the conversation sometimes you don't want to pay the bill I mean you got to do things you don't want to do it's just part of being mature
[time=2013] and we prepare them for that kind of thinking early on next point at five to twelve they can learn they really can they can learn to love and value the scriptures with your guidance do you know that
[time=2025] with your guidance and with your involvement they can begin to love and value the word of God they begin to love and value the word of God because guess what they see you doing what they see you loving and valuing the word of God and when they see you loving it and valuing it they begin to
[time=2047] so I got to ask you this morning do you or you know what I could do you know what you could do you could just ask them and I could just ask yours and you know what they'll tell me and mine would tell you they'll tell us what we value and what's important to us boom boom they'll list it off
[time=2076] and I just want to encourage you again mom's dads I want to encourage you to take 20 minutes maybe 30 and to sit down with a good Bible book or as they get older even even the scriptures and just to just sit down with your crew and read them a story
[time=2094] and as you read it's not you don't need a master's in divinity you don't need seminary education you can read them a story and you can ask them questions about that story and they'll have a good time answering those questions and you're thinking well I don't know if I can come up with the questions of course you can
[time=2112] you can fill out your taxes you can take a driving test you can balance your check anybody you can you can figure out questions from what you're reading to your kids many of the books already have them for you do it
[time=2126] and then after they answer the questions pray with them about the answers to the questions
[time=2137] they'll value it will become a part of the way they think and the way they respond they'll want to have Bible time they'll want you to sit down with them and do that thing again where we read that story daddy and we acted out those parts
[time=2154] something my friends is going to direct and influence their thinking something's gonna get in there and I'm encouraging you this morning to have that something be the very truth the life changing truth of God's word
[time=2174] one more here when asked a question when asked when your child when my child gets asked a question or is verbally engaged by an adult you can help them learn to stand still look people in their eyes and speak clearly
[time=2192] we can do this and I think we should do this because I think a young boy or girl who's willing to look an adult in the eye and do their very best to speak clearly without a hand or mouth you know you get the hand out of the mouth and you kind of learn to stand still and you learn to look them in the eyes and just respond
[time=2212] I'm not talking about a five minute dialogue I'm just talking about basic responses I'm fine thank you how are you we had a good time yes school is going good you know and that gets advanced as the years go by but my point is this that shows respect
[time=2230] that shows that we're willing in those moments to stop for a moment and honor someone and again you don't need me to stand here and tell you that in culture today with kids the tendency is to just move right on past and not honor and not show the respect
[time=2248] because they got things to do they got places to go they got stuff to go and do and we want to just help them slow down a little bit and extend kindness and to be courteous three keys
[time=2263] it's just a it's just an overview now three keys to all of that but I want you just to take note of and these are just things that again we see in the scriptures and things that we've learned through life
[time=2276] number one if you want to try and give an attempt at all that we just talked about there is going to have to be in you as a mom and there's going to have to be in you especially as a dad a willingness to come home at night
[time=2290] when you want to just sit and watch the news when you want to sit and read the paper when you you could think of fifteen other things you'd want to do other than this but you and I have got to keep learning
[time=2301] to go in there especially with these little ones and get on the floor and get down on your knees and play with the blocks and build the track help color the picture
[time=2316] and they at a very early age when they see again and again and again you as a dad and you as a mom on the floor not yelling at them down the hall to do this or that because you're so consumed with what you're doing now you need to go and do at times
[time=2332] what you need to go and do which is why they should spend a half hour on their own playing quietly but there are times when you need to be in there with them on the carpet
[time=2343] eye to eye face to face making stupid sounds and funny faces and doing whatever it is they're doing because when you do that they begin to understand oh this person not only loves me and is going to help me know when to eat and sleep
[time=2359] and they carry some you know and they carry some weight there but they're also down here playing blocks with me they must they must love me they must like being with me this is a good thing carpet time
[time=2373] secondly I want to just tell you this you can write this down non-conflict teaching this is a lesson that I continue to need to learn and I need to continue to get better at this my friends we are all prone to try and correct we try and teach
[time=2388] we try and correct in the middle of conflict don't we something happens something gets said some rule gets broken some disrespectful thing goes on and boom our temperature goes up our voice gets loud all of a sudden they fire back now we're into a conflict and right there and right there in that moment I'm going to teach you what you should do
[time=2412] and it never at that level it never goes well these are not these are not settings for good learning and good communication to take place
[time=2425] no you and I need to be much better at when things are good when things are quiet nobody's upset with anybody we're having a good afternoon and maybe maybe we've been working on the talking to adults thing
[time=2441] I'll just go back to that because we talked about it maybe that's something we've been trying to work with junior about and now there's no conflict and we're kind of waiting for dinner so I take junior and we sit in the living room and I do a little five minute deal
[time=2454] where I just remind him of that concept and we do a little role play right there and we have fun with it but we work on that because he needs to work on that but I want to work on that with him when I'm calm and when he's calm and when things are good because he learns and he takes it in
[time=2470] you want to give yourself to all these things that we've talked about you're going to have to spend some time on the floor with them you're going to have to do your very best to teach them in settings and at times where it's conducive to teach and then thirdly
[time=2487] and this is where you know people leave the church and I'll get a no matter what I say here in the next five minutes I'll get a letter this week calling me a child abuser but I just want to say it to you again and if you leave or you write me a note have at it
[time=2504] but I hope you'll listen to me here this morning because I I love my kids Deborah and I love our kids deeply and I love your kids and God's Word says in Proverbs 13 24 and there's there's no other way to take it and there's no other alternate translation it's just as clear as can be that he who withholds the spoon
[time=2533] whatever you might choose to use when talk about that if you'd like to I'd be happy to I've got some opinions about that but he who withholds the rod of discipline because there are times when you and I need to bring correction
[time=2549] it says he who withholds the rod hates hates despises his son but he who loves him he who cares about his heart her soul their future the way they think the patterns that they get established
[time=2572] he who loves his child disciplines him diligently and I just want you to understand that that there is a way I believe that you can discipline you can bring a loving but painful reminder and I put loving painful reminder because you know what disobedience hurts
[time=2595] every adult in this room can look me in the eye and you can tell me your story and I'll tell you mine that when you get outside the realm of God's will when you disobey God it hurts it's painful and God uses that pain you know to bring repentance and he uses that sorrow to bring growth
[time=2619] and so I want to do my very best to loving Lee and I mean that these times you know in our house you know at the end of my bed there in our room they are times that usually take about ten minutes
[time=2633] so you'd never yank a kid in a room you'd never do this mad and angry you'd never do this having popped your gasket you'd never do this yelling and screaming that's not loving and that isn't what I'm condoning and it's not what God's word is suggesting
[time=2648] see these times in our home they take about ten minutes because we're going to sit down and kind of hold a hand and talk through what happened make sure we're really clear on the violation that took place we pray together
[time=2662] I administer the discipline we hug we pray again we hug again we talk it back through again and then we get up and go make it right and it takes time and you're thinking my gosh that sounds like five ten minutes yes it is
[time=2681] and you multiply that by one two three four kids and you get a bad night going and you're busy but what are you going to do what are you going to do you're going to hate your kid so please I'm begging you give all the above some thought
[time=2708] and if there's anything that God said that's confusing let me know if there's any questions that you have let us know we've got people who could come alongside you not as experts but people in the fray with you who maybe have seen a little bit more of it than you have
[time=2723] who could give you some encouragement all right one more thing we're going to jump into here this is going to be a two week deal I hope you'll come back next week but I want to start into this next point we've got a few more minutes start late
[time=2734] all that was about starting early and we got him up to 12 years of age right okay now we're 12 years of age or so and older and I'm telling you start late start late
[time=2748] and here's why I'm going with this today in my opinion and you may have a different one that's fine in my opinion and I know it's been this way you know for ages there's just like we said in week one there is some specific stuff going on today that's just
[time=2763] like nothing we've ever seen before I believe most of Satan's eggs are in one basket he's got a lot of baskets and he's got a few eggs in each but I believe most of Satan's eggs today as it relates to your kids in mind are in one basket
[time=2781] and that basket my friends is sex that's the basket that he's chosen to come and get as many of you as he can and he's been trying to get as many of us as he can as well in that but today in some new ways and at some new levels he's trying to get the next generation
[time=2802] and the biggest basket with the most eggs is the basket called sex it is it is culture's dominant theme it is the dominant theme and message to our kids the clear and consistent message to our kids is fool around
[time=2821] fool around get into it think and live sexually it's all about the provocative provocative clothing Stephen Mitch talked about that last week provocative clothing or the lack thereof that reveals or draws specific attention to specific parts of the body and it just gets more and more and more specific
[time=2845] it gets to where more and more so today you know and I know you're walking down you see somebody and boom it's like you can't look anywhere else because it's all there is to look at he's just he's just moving us down this provocative road it's about sensuality
[time=2862] sensual videos sensual song lyrics on the radio sensual website sensual movies that begin to literally back to week one Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel literally begin to program or reprogram their minds and their souls literally attempting to guide them in a new direction as it relates to choice
[time=2884] the enemies even enticing students to sensual conversations that's right through IMing or exorbitant amounts of IMing and text messaging conversations they would never ever ever have in person are now commonplace at the touch of a key
[time=2907] the enemy and culture today is about sex it's about hooking up I think it's how it said these days hooking up and here's where we're losing the kids parents because here's the deal
[time=2927] God, God designed hooking up God, God's the author of provocative and sensual see God's okay with that God made all that to be what it is
[time=2945] you go back to Genesis we don't have time but you should you should read it today you know or tomorrow you should read Genesis 1 2 3 and there especially in 2 there when Adam and Eve you know Adam's on his own and God realizes it's not good for Adam to be alone so God puts
[time=2962] Adam to sleep right pulls out a rib get some dust forms a woman remember if you read that text he forms Eve Adam's asleep he forms Eve gets her fully made this is prior to sin so we got no we got no clothing there was no shame then there was no hiding
[time=2981] so we got Eve perfect woman right there he hey wake up he gets he gets Adam back in the game Adam wakes up shakes his head looks and you should just read in the text I mean the response is just classic I mean in the vernacular of our day when you read that response it's as if Adam just says
[time=3003] whoa she's hot he can't believe it she's just beautiful and it's just this instant God designed intimacy see God designed hooking up he designed for a he's all about sensual and the enjoyment of the intimacy process and the body parts and the whole sexual arena was designed by him for people to thoroughly
[time=3032] enjoy when they get lucky 16 board no no that's not God's design God's design was for you to thoroughly enjoy it when you get what married parents their bodies students I'm going to talk to you next time
[time=3061] students I'm going to talk to you next week specifically next week students I hope you come back the outline next week students it's going to be start early start late start over
[time=3076] but this morning we're talking to parents to adults who have the privilege of influencing parents adults their bodies and their souls which are at you understand this right bodies and souls absolutely connected
[time=3090] you understand that right when you when you mess with one of those you mess with the what the other parents their bodies and souls are designed by God to be given to and seen by one other
[time=3105] one other person now I know that sounds radical and I know that sounds like completely over the top but I believe that's his design that the body and soul of a young boy or a young woman was it was designed by God to be seen by and enjoy deeply
[time=3124] by one person I don't believe God designed a young 16 year old girl's body and soul to be tried on like a coat at the gap and worn for a while and put back on the rack
[time=3143] he had in mind I think he designed that coat for one person and one person only it's called a spouse parents adults in the room do you agree with me on that in general if you agree with me and you're here in the room this morning
[time=3158] and you're a parent or an adult who has influence just say yes all right I do too but why is it that there's something in us sorry there's something in me it may not be in you but there's I can say yes to that I said yes with you I believe that to be true yet there's something in me that wants to at times push them
[time=3187] out there towards starting early and we may not do it knowingly or we may not do it you know aggressively but there's something in us that continues to start them early
[time=3203] why do we do that why do we start them why do we allow if we say yes to what we just talked through why are we allowing and why are we promoting and why are we pushing toward early rather than late
[time=3217] what do I mean by that I'll just give you this and we're going to go we promote romance we promote romance in my opinion way too early and sometimes I think we think it's cute
[time=3231] sometimes I think we kind of enjoy it it's kind of we feel like it's kind of innocent and we start kind of having fun with it I see 12 to 13 year olds with parents encouraging them to like a boy or like a girl
[time=3243] a little bit more than 14 or 15 year olds being given the parental green light on the whole romance thing a little hand holding here little kissy kiss there some unbelievable amounts of time on the phone or I am maybe even some time in the basement alone watching a movie
[time=3263] when you see feelings and love and commitment not to mention time spent with the other family as if we were already actually in laws somebody somebody find me a 15 year old who can manage all that with purity
[time=3285] and responsibility and discernment and self-control see I don't I don't think there is one and I don't say that in a derogatory way against the 15 year old because you know what they're 15
[time=3303] I'm 43 and still working on trying to get all that stuff straight and figured out and done well but I'm going to send my daughter down to the basement with a boy in the dark to watch a movie
[time=3322] no and if it sounds like I don't like 15 year old boys I don't know I'm just kidding that's not true
[time=3336] hey if any of this begins to sound like I don't like kids you guys up there you know it's not true you know I love you you know that you parents know I love your kids I have a huge heart for kids today I am for students
[time=3351] not going to ask them to appropriately manage sexual opportunities and each other's hearts and souls before they've ever been an algebra to
[time=3363] before they've ever got a driver's license before they've I mean I'm just not going to do it and you and I have to exercise wisdom and discernment and how we're going to handle that stuff
[time=3373] kids you'll get there students you'll get there God will grow and prepare you if you let them to be in a meaningful relationship when you're capable of meaningful and here's where we're going to end this and we're going to come right back to this next week
[time=3387] because here's what I hear today I hear this this is not me just saying I hear this to you I'm telling you I hear this and I see this with good intentions and with good hearts and I'm thankful that we have the dialogue me and some of these kids
[time=3401] whoa whoa whoa pastor Kelly I don't want meaningful but can I just make out to have fun
[time=3414] and I just want you to everybody in the room I just want you to think about that statement making out for fun not for keeps not serious
[time=3430] maybe I don't want to be in love I want to play a video game I want to make out
[time=3440] and these aren't bad kids these are good kids asking an honest question and the question my friends in the room today indicates how far in he's gotten to the thinking and the mindset
[time=3454] back to making out for fun next week I hope you'll join us would you stand and let's pray Father God thank you so very much for the privilege that you give us to learn
[time=3466] and to think through these things with your help God with the word of God and the spirit of God guiding us we pray you would allow us to be parents that would parent and love in a way that could make a difference
[time=3479] Father God I pray that you would give us wisdom and I pray God that you'd give our kids humility and a receptiveness to our efforts they're not always right we make mistakes but God I pray that you would help us keep our families together
[time=3493] working through things of this nature we don't want the next generation abducted we want them safe and healthy God doing great things for you and for the kingdom would you give us wisdom and help us get there
[time=3506] in your time and place thank you for this morning and bring us back again next week as we continue this discussion and all the people agreed and said amen
