[time=70] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I'm so thankful for the chance to get to spend this time with you this morning.
[time=79] I want to just tell you how encouraged we've been. We have been so very thankful for the response
[time=85] that we've received these last few weeks as we've kind of made our way through this series that we've entitled Kidnapped.
[time=92] Satan's attempt to abduct our next generation, from the letters that we've received,
[time=98] from the emails that you've sent, from the conversations that you and I have had out in the community.
[time=104] I just am overwhelmed by what it appears God is doing in so many hearts, in so many lives,
[time=111] in so many families and homes, and we're just so thankful that we've been able to have these weeks,
[time=117] and I'm so thankful that you're going to be able to see what we continued to discuss and talk about and teach on,
[time=126] regarding Satan's efforts to move our kids away from what's true and right and good,
[time=132] and what you're going to see today is the second part of a discussion we had with parents.
[time=138] It began two weeks ago, and I just can't tell you how important it is in this endeavor that we find ourselves in
[time=146] to love and care for and give leadership to our kids the way we parent, the way we give them parameters,
[time=153] the way we provide guidelines, the way that we discipline, the ways in which we love them,
[time=159] and the ways in which we love them according to the principles of God's Word.
[time=163] It's so very important, and it's so very vital that we do that faithfully.
[time=168] There are times when I don't, and I know there are times when you don't, and so it's just been a great reminder for many of us, and for some of us it's been new learnings
[time=179] and new teaching on this topic, but these last two weeks, our discussion with parents has been so, so encouraging.
[time=185] So watch today, if you're a parent, if you're a grandparent, if you're an older brother or sister,
[time=191] if you're an aunt and uncle, if you're a coach, if you're a small group leader, I mean if you are anybody who has a chance to influence and love kids, this message is for you.
[time=202] We will conclude this series next week, and I am so looking forward and would ask you to pray with us.
[time=208] Many of us here at Blackhawk are praying for this coming week and our conclusion to this series
[time=215] as we speak directly to kids, but today it's about parents, and parents know how thankful I am for each and every one of you.
[time=223] I know we're trying our best, and we've all got blind spots, and we've all got ways in which we could improve,
[time=229] and I hope and pray that today as God speaks to you through His Word and through these principles that you'll be not discouraged.
[time=236] I hope you'll be encouraged to keep at it and to do whatever you've got to do.
[time=241] To look for the help and to look for the accountability and to look for the encouragement that you and I both need to parent well.
[time=249] Thank you so much for tuning in. We love you, and we're so thankful that we get to support you in what you're doing.
[time=256] Have a great, great rest of your week, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=266] [MUSIC]
[time=341] And when, before the throne, I stand in Him complete, Jesus died my soul to save, my lips shall still repeat.
[time=360] That Jesus made it all, all to Him I hope, sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it by a stone.
[time=379] Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it by a stone, he washed it by a stone, he washed it by a stone.
[time=402] Oh praise the one who made my death, and raised his life up from the dead.
[time=466] [MUSIC]
[time=521] 23 years ago, I was 20 years old, and every time we sing that chorus right there,
[time=530] oh praise the one who paid my debt, who raised this life up from the dead.
[time=536] I just can't help but remember, I was 20.
[time=539] I was in Los Angeles, Grace Community Church, back row, right side.
[time=546] John MacArthur preaching through Romans 7.
[time=550] Verse 25 I think, oh wretched man, that I am.
[time=556] Who will save me from this body of death?
[time=560] Thanks be to Jesus Christ, it says there.
[time=563] And what a great, great truth, and I'm so thankful.
[time=567] I know many of you are so grateful this morning.
[time=569] No matter how old you are, no matter how much life you've seen, if you know Him, if you really know Him today, if you've fully surrendered your heart and life to Him, then you've experienced that redeeming power.
[time=582] You know what it's like to be dead, and to be made new.
[time=586] Amen?
[time=587] [AMEN] Well it's sure good to see all of you.
[time=590] We have had an enormous response in the last few weeks to this series that we felt like God led us several weeks ago to embark upon.
[time=599] We felt like it was time, we felt like it was a good opportunity for us to do our very best, to take the truths of God's Word and try to speak into this family, to try to speak into this culture,
[time=610] to try and just encourage and help and remind parents and students, the young and the old,
[time=616] of what God's design is for our families and for our lives.
[time=621] And specifically, God's design for our response to this evil one,
[time=627] the enemy who is trying desperately to kidnap, to abduct our next generation.
[time=634] And so as we've made our way through these weeks, I tell you the response has been from, you know, from senior adults all the way down to junior high students.
[time=642] We have gotten emails and letters and had hallway conversations with people who have so appreciated
[time=648] and been so thankful for the things that we've been able to share.
[time=652] I'll tell you what I'm really grateful for is this.
[time=655] So many of you have received these teachings.
[time=658] So many of you have listened with hearts of humility.
[time=662] And I know what it's like to hear people talking about the things that you yourself are engaged in.
[time=668] I know what it's like to hear the scriptures taught and realize that maybe there's some adjustments that need to be made.
[time=674] I really understand what that's like to realize that you're not there yet and that there are some things that you might not only need to do different in the future, but there may be some things you need to go back to and give some thought and attention to and the way that most all of you have received this has been so encouraging.
[time=690] I want to just remind you briefly where we've been.
[time=692] And then I want to jump right back in today where we started out, where we left off last week, kidnapped.
[time=701] Satan's attempt to abduct our next generation. Week one, what we did was we looked at the very first kidnapping ever recorded in Scripture.
[time=709] If you weren't here, I'd invite you to get the CD or the DVD or download it off the website.
[time=714] We looked at what Nebuchadnezzar did in Daniel 1.
[time=718] And you go back through that story with Daniel and Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and you realize that there were some things that the enemy was up to then that he's still up to today. And there were four basic points.
[time=729] He's trying to separate kids from families.
[time=732] He's trying to reprogram their minds away from what's true and right and good.
[time=738] He's doing his very best to impress them with all his stuff.
[time=743] And he's trying to give them a new identity.
[time=749] That's what Nebuchadnezzar did with those boys.
[time=752] It's what the enemy is still trying to do today. Week two, Steve and Mitch did a great, great job of talking very specifically about the enemy's schemes.
[time=761] And they talked about how Satan is a tempter and how he is a deceiver and how he is an accuser and how he is a destroyer and how he brings all of those efforts relentlessly on the attack against our next generation.
[time=776] And then week three, last week, we saw that.
[time=779] And I think most of us agreed with this.
[time=782] I didn't get a lot of emails. I didn't get a lot of letters saying the opposite.
[time=786] I feel as if there was great agreement in the room that a lot of the rebellion, a lot of the disrespect, a lot of the self-centeredness, the patterns of disobedience that we bump into at times, at age 16,
[time=802] a lot of that began back at eight months.
[time=806] And so last week as parents, we asked the question.
[time=809] We said with so much at stake, and we all realized there's a great deal at stake.
[time=815] I don't think there's anybody in the room today who, when you look at the next generation and the opportunities that they can have and the difference that they can make and the attack that's coming against them, nobody in here is going to argue the fact that there is a great deal at stake.
[time=830] And so with so much at stake, we asked the question, how can we help?
[time=835] How can we help them and not hinder them?
[time=838] How can we help this process and not hinder the process of all that God wants to establish in their hearts and minds and souls as the days go by?
[time=848] And so last week we looked at three things.
[time=850] And we tried to make it really simple.
[time=852] We got about halfway through and we're going to finish today.
[time=855] And I got to say this, there's been a little bit of an edit in the series.
[time=859] We were going to end today.
[time=861] But in order to end today, we were going to have to hurry through the rest of the parent stuff.
[time=869] And we didn't want to, some of you are maybe wishing we would hurry and get through it, but we're not.
[time=875] We're going to go slow today and we're going to give the parent stuff, it's due.
[time=879] We're going to just take our time and work through some things here this morning.
[time=882] And then we've extended the series one more week.
[time=884] And next week we're going to conclude with what I believe and I'm hoping and praying is going to be a powerful, powerful Sunday.
[time=891] We're going to give most of our attention and discussion next week and our next generation to our kids and our students and our young people.
[time=899] But today we're going to continue on with this discussion.
[time=902] We started last week and we basically had three points in our discussion to parents.
[time=907] Start early, start late, and start over.
[time=911] Say those with me again, repeat after me.
[time=913] Start early, start late, start over.
[time=917] And on the start early front, here's the basic summary.
[time=921] Here's the gist of what we said last week.
[time=924] We talked about starting early, how important it is to begin to build into and invest in their hearts and minds.
[time=930] Life-changing truths, God-honoring principles early.
[time=934] We talked about zero to two years of age, two to five years of age, five to twelve years of age.
[time=939] And we talked basically about how from newborns to twelve years of age, this is by far the most important, most crucial time for parenting.
[time=950] This is when the biggest investment really gets made.
[time=953] This is when we have the opportunity to instill in them the God-honoring truths that can give them life and freedom and then the opportunity and the privilege of walking with and honoring him.
[time=965] Somebody asked me throughout the week, what would the bottom line be on the zero to twelve-year talk?
[time=971] Well, here you go, I wrote these four things down.
[time=973] It is between newborn and twelve years of age that they get their view of and their response to, this is where we teach them their view of and their response to authority.
[time=985] God's and yours, God's through you.
[time=989] God gave them you to help them learn how to respond to His authority.
[time=996] Make sense?
[time=998] During these years between newborn and twelve, we talk about the great opportunity for you and I to instill in them a sense of responsibility.
[time=1007] Ownership for things they do, ownership for things they say, along with opportunities to contribute to a family, to a home, the beginnings of a work ethic and trustworthiness.
[time=1018] Thirdly, we talked about respect, the way in which you discipline and the way in which you lead and the way in which you establish parameters, the things you begin to expect from them.
[time=1029] Help them, they begin to understand that there is an expectation by you for them to be respectful young men and respectful young ladies.
[time=1042] And then these are the ages, fourthly, these are the ages when we help them most by giving them order, appropriate boundaries, loving discipline, all in the context of relationship.
[time=1052] These are the ages when we get to help them most with bringing order and appropriate boundaries and loving discipline and relationship.
[time=1061] Proverbs 22-6, many of you know this, some of you may not.
[time=1066] Proverbs 22-6 says train up a child in the way he's trained.
[time=1071] Train, train means you and I have got to make an effort.
[time=1075] Train means to make a deposit, train means to take principles and lovingly and faithfully and diligently insert them, train up a child
[time=1084] in the way he should go, even when he is old it says he will not depart from it.
[time=1089] And look at Proverbs 22-15, very important to distinguish this this morning.
[time=1093] I didn't do this last week and I want to make sure we take a few minutes on this this morning.
[time=1097] Look at the first line there in Proverbs 22-15, be thinking about this zero to twelve years of age or so.
[time=1104] It says foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child.
[time=1109] You see that and just stop right there, we'll get to the next part of that verse in just a moment.
[time=1113] But I want you to see that, foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child.
[time=1118] Down deep in their soul because they're from you and because they're from me, because they're from fallen people.
[time=1126] There is in them the seed of sinfulness.
[time=1130] They're a cute little six month old but they're sinful.
[time=1135] There is in their heart and soul foolishness that which is apart from God, that which is opposed to what's right.
[time=1144] Sometimes we don't want to use the word evil with a baby but it's in them and it's in us.
[time=1150] Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child.
[time=1154] Now there's also something called childishness and I want to make sure we understand what we're disciplining and what we're giving attention to and what we're not.
[time=1164] Or not that we're not going to give attention to childishness.
[time=1167] It's this that we're not going to discipline childishness.
[time=1171] A spilled glass of milk is childishness.
[time=1176] It just what? It happens.
[time=1179] They didn't mean to.
[time=1181] It's not as childishness.
[time=1184] It's just stuff that happens because they're kids. Foolishness.
[time=1188] The sinful stuff is when you and I witness willful defiance.
[time=1197] I don't want to.
[time=1200] I don't have to.
[time=1202] I'm not going to share.
[time=1205] I don't want to come home at ten.
[time=1208] I'm not going to pick up my room and it may be very verbal.
[time=1212] It may be very nonverbal but willful defiance.
[time=1215] Authority asked you to do this and the child says no.
[time=1222] Either in look or word or a combination of both.
[time=1227] And that foolishness, God's word says, is bound up in their heart.
[time=1230] It's deep in their heart.
[time=1233] And discipline, loving discipline on your part in mind, is God's designed to get that out.
[time=1242] The rod of discipline will remove it far from him.
[time=1249] You and I aren't willing to do that if you and I aren't willing to take the time to lovingly discipline, bring boundaries and order and parameters.
[time=1258] Then we all know what happens.
[time=1261] We all have seen it. They become this.
[time=1263] It's the quote we saw last week from a very trusted pastor and radio personality.
[time=1268] I see in today's youth the laziest, most under disciplined, overindulged
[time=1274] and over entertained generation I've ever seen.
[time=1278] Sometimes it's easier just to entertain them than to discipline them.
[time=1282] They've actually grown up to believe that every room and vehicle should have DVD capacity.
[time=1290] That earphones and headsets are a natural part of our human anatomy and that want. I want that.
[time=1298] I want that. I want. They've learned that want truly determines need.
[time=1304] And I would venture to say that the want, I want that.
[time=1308] I think part of that comes from their sinful nature and part of that comes from them watching you and me.
[time=1315] Want being redefined as need.
[time=1319] And please, parents, he says make no mistake. This one is our fault.
[time=1324] Start early, my friends. If you missed any of that last week, I would really encourage you to pick up the CD, to order the DVD, to go online and download it onto your MP3 or iPod, do whatever you've got to do to just sit and listen and take some notes through those 0 to 2, 2 to 5, 5 to 12. We got very specific with some things that you and I can do and give ourselves to to help our children in this arena. Start early. On the start late front, here's what we said. On the start late front, I asked all adults in the room a question. I asked every parent in the room a question and we all responded. Here was the question I asked. I started out the start late discussion by saying, without a doubt, Satan has thrown most of his eggs in one basket.
[time=1372] And that one basket today is sex. That's the basket through which he's trying to in many, many, many, many, many, many, many different ways
[time=1382] abduct our next generation. And so I asked all adults, moms and dads, this question, I said, do you believe in God's design for intimacy?
[time=1394] Do you believe in God's design for intimacy? And here's what I meant by that.
[time=1398] Do you believe that sexual activity in the way that God designed it?
[time=1402] Do you believe that sexual activity is progressive in nature? What do I mean by progressive in nature?
[time=1410] What I mean by progressive in nature is this. Do you believe that God designed it and the way it plays out in the human heart and mind and body? Do you believe that it's progressive? That once you start whatever that looks like, we won't get into that. Whatever starting that physically intimate process looks like at whatever age and it could be your right, it could be really innocent and it could be really harmless in some ways. But do you understand and do you believe that the intimacy process is progressive in nature? That once you start you are going to finish.
[time=1458] And there may be a bunch of steps in between. And there may be
[time=1466] once you start, I say a bunch of steps, because once you start and you do this, well that was fun.
[time=1474] Well now I think I'm going to do what? I'm going to do this.
[time=1478] And then once we get here, then that lasts for a while and then we're going to go where?
[time=1482] Here. And we're going to take step after step after step after step. And we know what we might get to a point where we realize, oh my goodness, we should kind of slow down here. We should start fighting this. And now we're fighting. And now we're struggling.
[time=1498] And now we're sinning and now we're in this mess and this whole beautiful thing that God designed has come this fight and this wrestling with and we get accountability and we go and get help and we confess it. But it's progressive and you can fight and fight and get accountable and get accountable. But you know it's like once this starts then by and large this thing ends. And where it ends, God designed where it ends, it ends in this amazing ultimate of intimacy. That He allows for what it says in Hebrews 13, the marriage bed. He says let it be undefiled.
[time=1534] Let it be pure and sweet and experienced. That ultimate act of intimacy within my design and my parameters. A thing called marriage. I asked you if you agreed with that. You said yes.
[time=1546] And we also said this. We said having agreed with that do we understand then as a group of people would we not our heads yes or no. That an inordinate amount of time spent together. We're talking 12 year olds, 13, 14, 15, 16 year olds. Would we agree that an inordinate amount of time spent together in person on the phone, on the phone talking on the phone or on the phone text messaging on the phone or on the computer I aming? Would we agree that inordinate amount of time spent together just him and just her?
[time=1586] Emotions shared. Words of commitment spoken and the beginnings of physical contact and exploration only serve that those things only serve. Would you agree that those things only serve to further that intimacy process?
[time=1602] Yes or no? And you all said yes.
[time=1606] And I said yes. A process that finds its fruition eventually in the ultimate God-designed sexual act. And you all said yes and I said yes.
[time=1618] And I said well then why if we're all saying yes to that at 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, why then do we do some things that seemed almost look contradictory to what we just said we believed.
[time=1634] Number one was we tend to promote romance. We start early. We'll say yes to all the above but then we start promoting romance.
[time=1646] If all of that's true then my question for you and for me because I was really honest with you I said I feel it in me too and I'm going to have to wrestle with this and deal with this. Why the inordinate amounts of time then? Why the parental green light? Again and again I see it for this inordinate amount of time spent together.
[time=1666] Why the almost giddy support from us at times of 12 year olds and 14 year olds liking each other?
[time=1674] Why would an adolescent today have a computer with internet capacity in their room behind a closed door? Why?
[time=1686] Why would 15, 16, 17 year olds be in dark basements alone watching anything? They could be watching Barney.
[time=1698] It could be Sesame Street and they're 17 and the lights are off and the couch is soft and it's dangerous and you say well I trust them.
[time=1714] Well you know what? I'm getting there. I mean you know I've got one who's 14 and I've got one who's 4 and then we got everything in between and as we live life with our kids and as we learn lessons and as we make mistakes you know everybody and as we work through that stuff and as we sense a teachable spirit in our kids there's a sense where guess what? I'm learning to trust them more and more. You ask me if I trust my kids? Yeah I trust my kids.
[time=1746] Am I going to trust a teenager at 15, 16, 17 in a basement by themselves with an attractive young lady or young man with the door shut and the movie on on a couch?
[time=1758] No? And that has nothing to do really in my mind with all that we've been through and all that we've learned and the things I see happening. To me that's not even so much an issue of trust as much as it is an issue of common sense.
[time=1774] We just wouldn't you and I just don't think we'd do that really if we really really really thought that through.
[time=1782] Then I said to students last week I said hey gang young people be patient. I said meaningful and intimate relationship will come in time when your character and your heart and your mind is ready for meaningful and intimate and that's our job as parents to invest in them so that there's character grown and integrity established and hearts that are prepared for that and that's where some students today go time out and this is where we ended last week. Some students go wait a minute and they say it many of them honestly and genuinely asking they go time out we don't really want today we don't want meaningful and intimate. We certainly don't want the ultimate act and what may even come with that we don't want that we we just kind of like to make out for fun.
[time=1838] We just what about just making out for fun and I thought about it you know even over this past week had a few more conversations which I found very helpful and very insightful. In some places today in some pockets of student and youth culture it's called F.W.B.'s friends with benefits and as I thought about that whole idea of where we left it last week making out for fun I just I honestly came up with just some questions that I just thought I'd ask anybody and I say anybody because I understand you know this concept that's been introduced to our discussion here these last couple weeks making out for fun do you for a moment think that's just pertinent to 16 year olds huh yes or no no so I I want to respond to our kids but I also just want to respond to everybody a couple questions about making out for fun and I want to be careful how I do this because of the the demographic of our room I'm not trying to be startling and I'm not trying to be insensitive so I'll try here to be a little tactful some questions I would add here's a question I would ask a girl 14 15 16 17 year old girl thinking about this concept I would ask her where's his T.O.N.G.U.E. I'll just do it that way and if you can spell you're probably old enough to think it through where's that while this is going on I'd ask her where are his hands and what are they doing what are your bodies postured like where are you and are you sitting up or are you laying down or like what's going on there and then I'd ask them this maybe the most important of all questions what where's your mind what are you thinking about while you are making out for fun and then I'd ask them you know let's back up a little bit and this is probably the most telling question why are you why are we doing this what's this about I mean if we're interested at all in trying to understand God's design on all this and where we've why are why are you doing this
[time=2000] and I don't know I don't want to startle anybody but I hope all of you know and I'm thinking about the kids you know what I've made out before
[time=2014] and I'm not trying to be funny but I just want you to know I was 17 and I didn't know the Lord I was 20 and did know the Lord I'm not talking about this because I read some book I understand all of this been there why do we do that well I can definitively answer that for you and you know the phrase that I'm hearing it's a pretty good phrase for fun it's for you it's for your it's you it's about you in that situation taking it's about you in that situation getting it's all about you and your pleasure and your arousal and your excites all about you which is absolutely diametrically opposed to God's design and this process that he ordained which when we're in that in the appropriate settings it's to be all about them. Let me show you a passage in 1 Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians open your Bibles to 1 Thessalonians 4 1 Thessalonians 4 verses 3 to 7 let me just show this to you let me just make sure that you're many of you are reminded of this great truth and for others of you it may be new new truth but look at what it says in 1 Thessalonians 4 it says in 1 Thessalonians 4 verse 3 it says for this is the will of God there's a very declarative statement right there you want to know what the parameters are you want to know what the boundaries are you want to know what the sweet spot is as Mitch would say of being in God's will and look what he attaches to God's will just immediately it says there that this is the will of God your sanctification that sanctification big word meaning to become more and more like Christ to become more and more like our Lord that is that you abstain from sexual immorality and that each of you know how to possess his own vessel or body in sanctification and honor not in lustful passion translated fun not in lustful passion fun as defined by the enemy fun as defined by the enemy who's now moved that definition into your mind and many others in this room to abstain from sexual immorality but each of you know how to possess your own body in sanctification and honor not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God and that know watch this and that know man in this process here transgress or defraud his brother and on the making out for fun thing I want to just make sure we're clear on transgressing and defrauding because it's just so it's just so clear and so connected in the Greek in the original language here to transgress or defraud meant to step over a clearly established boundary it was a clearly established property line if you will to be on this side and that side was someone else's and when you transgress or defraud it means to literally step over that line and begin to take for yourself for the purposes of personal pleasure and enjoyment that which is not yours now when we get to the marriage bed Hebrews 13 it's yours she's his and he's hers and it's all one thing and God designed it and it's a great thing prior to that there's a nice there's a nice really clear line there and that body and all the parts of it and that soul and that mind it's not yours but we transgress and we defraud a brother or a sister when we take and we bring back over that line for our own enjoyment that which isn't ours boy look at this Ephesians 5-3 a few more things to think about on the making out for fun friends with benefits front look at Ephesians 5-3 this is just amazing but among you it says there must not even be a what?
[time=2298] say it out loud a hint it says among you there must not even be a hint of sexual immorality you're thinking okay I'm clear because sexual immorality has to do with fornication it has to do with doing this this end point this culminating act well but oh it keeps going there must not even be a hint of sexual immorality or any kind what kind any kind of impurity or of greed and the greed there speaks to the greediness of sexual involvement Paul says okay you want to ask I'll give you the answer God's design would be that there not be a hint nothing that there would be a commitment to purity not a hint of sexual immorality or any kind of impurity or greed because these are improper for God's holy people and you go whoa whoa whoa wait right there God's holy people and you're sitting there thinking gee whiz I'm 13 Kelly I'm not God's holy people yet and I understand that but I want you to know this that if you know him if you fully surrendered your heart and life to him guess what you're in Christ and by virtue of that unbelievable divine transaction because you've been redeemed you're his holy people and you may equate holy with you know Agnes and Dell as they stood up here a few weeks ago and I would agree but no no no no no no theologically and spiritually and practically if you know him he says you are holy and it's out now back to parents so we get to come alongside and provide help and encouragement and a deposit into your life and the appropriate parameters and boundaries and the discipline when needed to help you be holy to help you move and live in that direction one last thing on that you know what really concerns me what really really concerns me is when I see relationships moving forward that have sexual physical compromise as a foundation does that make sense? I understand the struggle I understand the choices that got made but what I get worried about is that when the choices get made and then when the struggle goes on and when things get done and we go down roads that got never designed as too physically and that's the foundation on which the relationship was built and now you see them going forward and they're talking about marriage and they're talking about the rest of their lives I've just kept in around long enough to see that a bad faulty broken foundation usually comes back to bite you and there are some in the room today and that was your foundation and you kept going forward and God by His grace came along and saved you and helped patch some of that up and bring wholeness and not only patched it up but forgave it and I understand that that's good but if you're in this mix right now I'm just encouraging you to be very honest about this this is not a good foundation there's a better one that you can have called purity and he can forgive whatever's been done and he can give you a new start and you can begin to come at this with new principles and new commitments but be careful how far you try to go on a foundation that's cracked a couple more things here on the parents in promoting romance I just wrote this in my notes vicarious living vicarious living here's what I mean by that and I'm going to speak generally here please let me give me the freedom to speak generally on this okay you give me the freedom shake your heads yes okay thanks generally I see men today generally speaking I see it and you know what I feel it in me and I have to admit it and I have to continue to work on it and pay attention to it generally speaking I see often times in men today then pushing young boys athletically professionally often times educationally I see dads pushing absolutely putting the hammer down on young boys to be what they want them to be to do what they want them to do to accomplish what they believe they should accomplish and there's this almost insane push from dads on the athletic professional educational vocational front this boy is going to do this and I see it absolutely destroy young boys and their hearts and their spirits I see it bring friction to relationships between those dads and those boys and it usually just wrecks havoc in a home generally speaking generally speaking and I see this more and more I sometimes feel as if I'm watching moms live romantically and vicariously through their daughters and I don't know if it's a romantic void in the marriage I don't know if it's just all the stuff they watch and read about and take in but it's almost as if there are times where there's just this they want it to happen and I understand them wanting it to happen i.e. her being happy and finding Prince Charming and getting married and riding off on a horse I understand that but I'm talking about 13, 14, 15, 16 as if they're kind of happy that she's getting together with and and no she would never say she wants it to go there but it's just dangerous vicariously trying to live through our kids and push them in ways they don't need to go yet exclusivity last thing I just think it's worth talking about I just don't think this is me chapter and verse I just don't think having said all that 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 I guess you know you're kind of getting there but I the exclusive I don't even know if that's a word exclusivity boyfriend and girlfriend I'm his she's mine we're together all the time I just don't know if it's a good idea I'm kind of leaning in the other direction these days and if my girls don't agree with me I hope they'll enjoy the content because that's where they're going but we're just we're just not gonna do that whole thing are you saying you're not gonna ever have them with boys well sure I'm gonna have them with boys I think that's great for kids to be together I think it's great for groups to do stuff I think it's great for you know us to host big events and have kids so I think it's great for friendships to be developed and do I understand that boys begin to like girls sure I do but I'm just gonna we're gonna do our best and I'm gonna encourage you to do your best to while while managing that and navigating that to move away from I'm his and she's mine and we're together all the time because that's marriage without sleeping together so we just got to be careful we expose them to early we promote romance too early we expose them to early all I mean by that is this as it relates to TV computers movies music radio videos my friends I believe and I think there's statistical analysis and data that would would support this not ages 5 to 15 the mind the mind and the heart of a 5 to 15 year old not even close being able to process the sensual imagery of illicit messages the illicit messages and sensual imagery of modern media they can't process it in a healthy God honoring way it just sends too many mixed messages it introduces them to too many new thought I mean how how are you doing on that forgive 5 to 15 year olds I struggle with that I'm having to be careful with that and you and I have got to be really really really wise in what we allow them to be exposed to which brings us to three quotes three parental quotes that concern me these are three parental quotes I've heard these are three parental quotes I have myself said or thought I want to be their friend I don't want them to resent me I just want them to have everything I didn't sound familiar raise your hand be honest thank you very much I want to be their friend you know what my friends I want to be their friend too and I look forward we were in a setting last night, Deborah and I and Mitch and Susie and some other friends we were in a setting last night we were in the family and I think all totaled there was about 10 or 12 of them and it was you know mom and dad and the kids and the spouses and it was just an amazing night and there was so much community around the table and so much relationship and so many years of experiences and life shared and there were these kids and spouses and it was great to sense the friendship that existed at that table and I longed for the day to sit at a table with my grown kids and be their friend they need me today to lead they desperately need you to lead them today five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve they need you to lead them they need you to have some vision for them they need they need you to scout out the dangers they need you to they need you to come alongside and make adjustments they need you to discipline them lovingly with the rod as the scriptures say and they need you on the floor with them playing with the blocks but they need leadership at this stage not primarily friendship I don't want them to resent you I'll tell you what here's here's here's how they'll resent you and I've seen this now I can say this they will resent you if you don't bring them the order and the discipline and the
[time=2976] parameters and the relationship if you don't bring to their life the leadership and the effort to bring into their hearts and minds the order that they need by God's design if you let that go just because you want to be their friend and you don't want them to resent you they will resent you in time they will thank you on the other hand in time for the order and the discipline and the parameters that you brought lovingly and faithfully and diligently I just want them to have everything I didn't you probably don't really mean that
[time=3018] I mean I understand that I do too in some ways but when we get right down to the bottom
[time=3024] I think what you want for them is what God wants for them when God wants it for them and I think you want to be able to give them things while teaching them about responsibility and work ethic and trust worthiness all right we got to go start early start late what start over why don't you buy your heads and have Corbin come on up if he would and just buy your heads we're just going to close with this right here as Corbin plays I just want you to think about something with me and I just please hear me on this whoever you are heads bowed and eyes closed whoever you are this morning if you're a parent in this room and you've got young ones you've got adolescent ones you've got older ones if you've parented at any point in your life and you look back over these last two weeks start early start late and you've made any and you sense in your heart you've made some mistakes if you sense in your heart at all this morning that there are some things you really wished you would have done differently or some things you feel like in your heart you need to do differently in the days to come in all honesty before God with your heads bowed in your eyes closed would you raise your hand if you're a parent in the room and you feel like there's some things you could do differently thank you you can put them down I just want to invite you to do this start over you get the CD from last week if you weren't here if you were get your notes out and you go back to zero to two or two to five or five to twelve and you go back as far as you might need to go back and if anybody wants help on this all you have to do is ask and we'll help you but those of you here this morning you just go back and you begin to look at some of those very specific principles that we laid out for you last week and begin to start over you know what before you start over they'll do this get on your knees tonight and before God be willing to humbly say God thank you for showing me this I'm sorry for the stubbornness that's in me
[time=3162] sorry I thought I could do this my way and then you know depending upon how old your your little boy or your girl is you may even want to go back to them because if you're going to go back now and do some things differently they need to know why and you may need to just honestly go to them and say you know what partner you know what sweetie I'm sorry we're going to do this differently I know I said we were going to do it this way we're going to do it a different way and I hope you'll forgive me I'm learning as a dad or a mom and we're going to walk down a little different road there's going to be some new expectations and we're going to work on this together I pray you would have the humility in this room today as a parent to do that no matter how old she or he might be she may be 20 she may be he may be 25 you may need to write a letter and though you can't take that 23 year old back and have him start cleaning up their room you can certainly start in a new direction having made some things right and encouraging them to do that differently in the days to come if God gives them that opportunity why don't you just stand if you would heads bowed and eyes closed let's just sing through this Corbin's just going to sing through this chorus just briefly and then we're going to just sing that verse and go home and thank God that as you confess and as I confess our mistakes our sin he forgives us he raises us up and he gives us new opportunities listen prayerfully as Corbin sings
[time=3259] oh praise the one who paid my debt and raised this life
[time=3267] from the dead oh praise the one who paid my debt
[time=3275] and raised this life from the dead oh praise the one who paid my debt
[time=3285] and raised this life from the dead
[time=3293] sing Jesus paid it all and Jesus paid it all all to whom I am sing ahead after Christ and stay keep washed and white as snow by sin ahead after Christ and stay keep washed and white as snow
