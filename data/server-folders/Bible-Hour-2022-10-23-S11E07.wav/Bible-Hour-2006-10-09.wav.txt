[time=30] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to us."
[time=60] "I have been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=69] Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=84] Watching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=95] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=114] We can wounded sinners, lost and left to die.
[time=130] Raise your head for love is passing by.
[time=136] Come to Jesus, come to Jesus, come to Jesus, and live.
[time=151] And now your burdens lifted and carried far away,
[time=158] and precious blood has washed away to stay.
[time=164] So sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus, and live.
[time=179] Like a newborn baby, don't be afraid to crawl.
[time=185] And remember when we walk, say times we fall.
[time=191] So find Jesus, find Jesus, find Jesus, and live.
[time=208] And sometimes the way is lonely and steep and filled with pain.
[time=214] So if your skies die for today, then cry to Jesus.
[time=223] Cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus, and live.
[time=236] Oh when the love spills over, the music fills the night.
[time=243] And when you can't contain your joy and sigh.
[time=249] Then dance with Jesus, dance with Jesus, dance with Jesus.
[time=259] And with your final heartbeat, kiss the world goodbye.
[time=274] Then go in peace and laugh on glory's side.
[time=281] And find Jesus, find Jesus, find Jesus, and live.
[time=298] And find Jesus, find Jesus, find Jesus, find Jesus in there.
[time=317] Hi, my name is Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving as the senior pastor.
[time=321] Here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I am so thankful that you've tuned in to our broadcast that we call the Bible Hour.
[time=328] I continue to be amazed. You think after all my years, I'd stop being amazed.
[time=333] But I just continue to be absolutely astonished by the amount of people, the number of folks who get up on Sunday morning and watch church at 7 o'clock.
[time=343] It is so encouraging to us and we're so thankful that we get to share this time with you.
[time=348] I know many of you watch as you're getting ready to go and be a part of your own church, that local family that you're a part of, but I also know that there's another group of you.
[time=358] And you know, I've told you before, how special you are to me.
[time=362] I'm so thankful because there are those of you who don't have a church to go to.
[time=366] You don't have a family yet.
[time=368] And at this stage of the game, for whatever reason, God's allowed us to connect and we're like family, though we've never met.
[time=376] And I just want you to know that we're mindful of you. We pray for you all the time.
[time=380] And we're so thankful that week after week you allow your heart to be opened and your mind to be open to what the Word of God says and the ways in which God's wanting to connect with you and that he allows us to be a part of that we just think is amazing.
[time=395] So thank you for tuning in. It's good to be with you again.
[time=399] As you can see on the screen behind me, we have been in the midst of quite a series. In fact, we've concluded it just this past week, the series that we've called Kidnapped.
[time=409] Satan's attempt to abduct our next generation. And it has been an amazing five weeks.
[time=416] I can't remember a five week span around here where we've seen more, where we've heard more, where we've sensed more of God at work and the hearts and lives of people, older people, younger people.
[time=428] People very close to the Lord. People far from God who are moving in their relationship toward faith.
[time=435] It has just been the response has been overwhelming. And I'm so very grateful for the opportunity that God gave us.
[time=442] Satan is after. He is absolutely after the next generation. He is relentless.
[time=449] And he is stopping at absolutely nothing to move them away from what's right and true and good.
[time=456] And so it has been a joy, a challenge at times, but a joy to try and come alongside this next generation in these five weeks to encourage them.
[time=465] It's been great to come alongside parents and remind them of how they can help and not hinder the process.
[time=472] And as you'll see today in our final installment, we just took the entire morning basically and tried to put our arms around the kids in a real special way.
[time=480] You'll see them on stage with me. And I'm so proud of them. I love them. I'm so thankful for the young people God has surrounded us with here at Black Hawk and I can't wait for you to see what happened.
[time=492] Hey, I also know that as you've watched over the five weeks, many of you have responded. Many of you have asked, can we get the five weeks on DVD or can we get the five week series on CD?
[time=504] And the answer to that is yes. There's a number here on the screen that's the church number you can call and just hit zero and ask for the receptionist and she can help you place that order.
[time=515] Just let her know what you're wanting. If you're interested in individual messages throughout the five weeks, if you want to download some things to your MP3 or your iPod, just go to our website at BlackhawkMinistries.org
[time=527] and you can take care of all that through the website and our hope is that those materials will be encouraging to you and helpful to you in the days to come. Whoever you are, I hope you realize this is a serious issue.
[time=541] He wants to ruin our kids and their futures and we have the chance to stand in the gap and do our very best to lovingly and with wisdom protect them and I hope you'll do that very thing. Thank you for tuning in. We love you. God bless you. And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=571] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=688] Well, we spent two weeks talking to parents and today we're going to talk to this is going to be all about today for the most part, the next generation. I have been so looking forward to just being able to kind of get eye to eye and face to face with those that we've been so, so concerned for. We love them dearly. We want so badly for them to have all that God designed them to have as young men and young women. And we know the enemy's efforts are relentless. And so today, we're going to gear our talk and spend most of our time talking to our youth.
[time=717] Our young ones, our adolescents, even our 20-somethings, we want nothing more than to come alongside in a meaningful way and support and encourage. And so here's what I'm going to do. Most of you know me, I like to be close. I'd much rather be face to face than peering out into the room. So this morning, the team did a great job, and they set up the stage. And I'm going to invite at this time, anybody, any young boy, girl, middle school, age, six, or something.
[time=746] Well, age, six, grade, and up to, you know, college age, 18 to 20-ish, you know, 22, whatever. If you're on the 10-year plan and you're 33, stay seated. Nothing wrong with a 10-year plan at all.
[time=762] But yeah, if you're a middle schooler, high schooler, college age, I'm going to invite you right now to come on up. Just come on up, all of you.
[time=769] And we've got chairs. We've got pillows. We've got rugs. Come on up and be a thank you. Come on up and just take a seat up here.
[time=776] We've got some chairs. You can sit on the floor. You can sit Mr. Omen. Nicely done. First one up there. We've got some -- we've got -- there you go. Great job.
[time=785] Come on up. Have a seat. And while they're coming up to have a seat, let me just encourage the rest of you with this.
[time=793] I've had several people ask me, will the KIDNAP series be available, you know, on CD, on DVD? And it is.
[time=801] I just want you to know, we'll conclude today. And if you want to get a set of the entire series, you can do so at the resource table, at the media table.
[time=808] You can go online and order CDs. You can download it onto your MP3 or iPod. DVD's are available online.
[time=816] You can call the church office. If the online thing's a bit confusing. And you can talk to the folks at the church office.
[time=822] They'd be happy to place an order for you. You can get one part from the series. You can get the whole series, whatever you'd like.
[time=828] We just want to make sure that you get that. And they can tell you about the cost and all that. But yes, the series will be available.
[time=835] So now, here's my dilemma. I'm thinking about this this morning. Thanks, you guys.
[time=839] Okay. Well, nobody behind the screen. Sorry. Come on. That's the student ministry's pastor behind the screen.
[time=845] Sorry about that. You can't be behind the screen. You've got to come up here and sit on the rugs, sit on the stairs.
[time=850] Nobody behind the screens. Come on. Sit up. Sit up closer, everybody. Nobody back there in the back rows.
[time=855] Come on up here. Keep going. Jesse West. Come on up to the front. Keep coming up here to the front. Get down here on the rugs.
[time=861] Here's my dilemma. The dilemma is, I've geared this entire morning. Come on, kids. Good job. Right up here in front.
[time=867] Somebody who, down goes the plant. Come up here in front, you guys. Good job. I've geared this whole talk to them.
[time=873] And I'm standing here looking at who. You, so I'm feeling like most of the morning, and they're going to kill me back in the back on the broadcast camera thing.
[time=882] But I think most of the morning, I'm going to try and, like, probably look at them and you all just get the privilege of, you know, listening in.
[time=890] I hope it's encouraging to you. I hope you take notes. I hope that as we talk, as we get a chance to, I mean, this is the next generation that he's trying to abduct right here.
[time=901] These are the very lives. These are the very young men and women who he is relentlessly pursuing, trying to move them. These right here.
[time=911] Away from what's right and true and good. He wants to destroy their lives.
[time=919] And we want to, this morning, do our very best. I want, this morning, to do my very, very best to encourage you, young men and women.
[time=927] I want you to know how much we love you, and I want to just, if you'll just listen, if you'll just give me a few minutes here, we're not going to go long.
[time=934] But if you just give me the privilege of just sharing with you some truth, some things I think you could take in that I think we think would really help.
[time=943] As you do your very best to stand, to stand there in the face of all that he's throwing your away and to stay true to what's true and right and good.
[time=954] And so let me just do that this morning. Let me start by saying this.
[time=958] I told your mom and dad, I told all the adults for the last two weeks. I've told them three things.
[time=964] We tried to make it really simple. I told all of you for the last two weeks, start what? Start early, start late and start over if you need to.
[time=974] And what I want to say to you, you young men and you young ladies, what I want to say to you today is this.
[time=983] I want to say that he's really, really, really after you. He really wants to ruin and deceive you.
[time=990] And as we think about a response, and as we even give you a chance this morning, and we're going to give you a chance this morning and we're going to give all of you a chance this morning to respond.
[time=999] And as I think about this time this morning, I want to just tell all of you three things. I want to tell you to start early.
[time=1005] I want to tell you to start late, and I'm going to invite you to start over. I'm going to beg you, like on my knees, if I have to, beg you to start early.
[time=1017] To start late on some things, and I'll equally beg on that one. And then I'm going to invite you to start over.
[time=1026] Because you know what, this age range right here, you guys and the life that you live and the things that you're exposed to, and you being human, just like me, I know you've already made mistakes.
[time=1044] Hi, Dean.
[time=1047] I know there's already been challenges. I know there have already been hard days, and so I want to give you the chance to start over.
[time=1055] Start early, start late, start over. And here's how I want to do this. First of all, I want to say this to you. Before we get to those three things, I want to say this to you.
[time=1064] These folks out here, if you've got a young person on stage this morning, or you even know somebody up on stage this morning, raise your hand.
[time=1075] Raise your hand. Raise your hand. If you've got, yeah, here you go. All right, thank you. Now, what I've said to them for two weeks, you guys, listen, I've told them for two weeks to start early, start late, and start over.
[time=1088] I've been encouraging them. God's Word has been directing them to try their very best to bring to your lives some really important principles and some really important God honoring parameters.
[time=1098] And most of them in the room this morning here are really good parents who desire in their hearts to do really good things, and they're not going to always do it right.
[time=1106] The efforts are going to be flawed and failed at times, but they're trying. And I just want to say to you this morning, cut them some slack.
[time=1115] Give them a break. Don't be too hard on them and not just don't be hard on them, but do your very best to with their efforts toward you to cooperate.
[time=1126] And I'm not just saying that because I think it sounds like a good idea, I want you to see what God's Word says.
[time=1132] God's Word speaks to your willingness to follow them and to allow them to parent and lead.
[time=1139] As painful as it might be at times. Look at what it says in Proverbs. I believe it's Proverbs 29, 15. Proverbs 29, 15 says the rod and reproof.
[time=1150] Look at that right there. The rod and reproof. The rod is the rod of discipline. We talked about that last week, actually the last two weeks.
[time=1158] There are times when your parents have to bring discipline and it hurts.
[time=1163] Most of you are of the age where that's not happening the way it used to when you were five and you got the rod of discipline, but still they bring discipline and they bring reproof.
[time=1174] Reproof is correction. The rod, discipline, and reproof correction as painful as it is to have privileges removed, as painful as it is to have discipline brought, as painful as it is for you to have them sometimes in good ways and sometimes in bad ways
[time=1192] step into your world and start doing things to try and help as painful as it is. Look at what it says.
[time=1201] But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother. The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother.
[time=1215] How many of you right here on the stage, truth be told, honest now, how many of you on this stage know what it's like to feel deep inside that they're saying one thing and you're saying another and you really, really, really want your own way?
[time=1231] Raise your hand. Thank you. It's an honest group. That didn't shock you, did it? See? And you want your own way, but you know what, gang?
[time=1243] I mean, I'm talking to you, but I could ask all of you. How many of you really, really, really want your own way? Raise your hand.
[time=1248] Alright, so a bunch of kids out here, a bunch of kids up here. We all got that going. And when we want our own way, and when we don't want to listen to discipline and reproof, shame is coming.
[time=1263] And when we parent in ways that allow them to just get their own way, shame is coming. Support your parents efforts. Parents make the effort.
[time=1274] Students, young people support their efforts. Proverbs 3, 11 and 12. Proverbs 3, 11 and 12 says it really well.
[time=1283] It says my son, do not reject the discipline of the Lord, or loathe, hate his reproof.
[time=1291] Verse 12 says for whom the Lord loves, he reproves, even as a father corrects the son in whom he delights.
[time=1300] Understand kids, understand students, young people, understand that God's great love for you.
[time=1306] You are not out of his sight. He knows everything going on in your world. He knows all that you're facing.
[time=1312] He knows all the challenges that you've got. And he, in his great love for you, he is bringing correction.
[time=1319] He is bringing parameters. He is bringing discipline to you, because he loves you, and he doesn't want you to go down certain roads.
[time=1326] He's bringing all that, and you say, well you know what, it'd be really nice if it was God bringing it, because God would bring it perfectly.
[time=1334] You're right. God would bring all that you need perfectly, but instead God chose them and me.
[time=1342] And so we try to bring it on his behalf, and sometimes we do it well, and sometimes we don't, but we're all you got.
[time=1350] And so I'm asking you this morning, as they begin to make efforts, please be respectful.
[time=1357] Allow them to do that, and not just allow them to do it, but welcome it. Look what it says in Ephesians 6.
[time=1363] Ephesians 6, 2, and 3 says, "Honor your father and mother, honor them, you guys. Be respectful toward them.
[time=1371] Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, and the promise is a great one.
[time=1376] The promise is so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on earth, and I want it to be well with all of you.
[time=1386] And God wants it to be well with all of you. And the way he says it's going to be well with you is when you honor and follow them.
[time=1397] So give them some support and do everything you can to honor their efforts.
[time=1402] All right, here we go. Start early. Here's what I'd say to you guys on the start early front.
[time=1406] Start early giving your heart to God. Start early giving your hearts to God.
[time=1412] Many of you, I'm looking at you. I'm seeing your faces. Many of you have done this, and it thrills my heart.
[time=1418] I find myself so grateful because I see it in you. You're already giving him your heart.
[time=1424] I want you to just remember what it says in Psalm 119. It's going to come on the screen.
[time=1429] You may not be able to read the screen. I think you could see it on the monitors down here if you want to read along.
[time=1433] But Psalm 119 9 says, "How can a young man, young men, raise your hands?"
[time=1439] Great. Put them down. "How can a young woman, young women, raise your hands?" There you go. Thank you. "How can a young person today?" "How?" "How in the world?" Somebody asked me this just recently.
[time=1452] Somebody said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Like really, Kelly, how in the world do you expect a young person today with all that's coming at them?"
[time=1460] The rate at which it's coming, the diversity of the temptation, the availability of it all.
[time=1466] And how can you expect them to be pure? How in the world are they going to do this?
[time=1472] I was so thankful for just the honesty of a 50-year-old, 52-3-year-old friend who just looked me in the eye recently and said,
[time=1480] "You know what? When I was a kid, I had to walk into the store and look somebody in the eye and buy it."
[time=1487] Now this gang, they can sit in a room somewhere and private and click a button.
[time=1497] Nobody knows, and there it all is. "How in the world is a young man or a young woman to keep their way pure by keeping it according to your what?"
[time=1512] Say it louder. Your word. By keeping it according to your word, it goes on in verse 9 and verse 10 to say,
[time=1520] "With all my heart the psalmist here." Gang says, "With all my heart, not with half of his heart, not with portions of his heart, but with all his heart I have sought you.
[time=1528] Do not let me wander from your commandments." In verse 11 it says this, "Your word, I have treasured. Your word, I have hid.
[time=1535] Your word, its principles, its concepts, I have hid in my heart that I may not sin against you."
[time=1542] I love what he says in verses 145 and 147, same chapter Psalm 119 verses 145, 146 and 147.
[time=1551] "I cried with all my heart. Answer me, O Lord, I will observe your statutes. You ever cry out for help? You ever cry out in desperation?
[time=1559] You ever feel like this thing's going downhill fast? In desperation. In the confusion of life.
[time=1566] In the temptation that he brings, the psalmist says, "When he cries out, he goes to the truth. He goes to the Word.
[time=1572] I cried to you, save me, and I shall keep your testimonies." Verse 147, "I rise before dawn."
[time=1582] How does that sound? Sorry. Are they a bunch of rise before dawners? No? Well, we'll work on it, okay?
[time=1591] I rise before dawn and cry for help. I wait for your words, utter and absolute dependence, you guys, on the Scriptures.
[time=1600] Let me just show you one more here. Joshua 1. Joshua, everybody open your Bibles to Joshua.
[time=1607] Back toward the beginning, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua chapter 1.
[time=1612] Hey, gang, up on the stage, listen to these words, would you? It says in Joshua 1, God is giving Joshua direction for this next season of his life.
[time=1623] As a young man, Joshua had been given a great responsibility, and so God says to Joshua, "Hey, I want this to go well for you.
[time=1630] I want you to experience everything that I have designed for you." And there's a way that you can do that.
[time=1637] And here's what he says to this young man, Joshua, verse 7, "Only be strong and very courageous.
[time=1642] Be careful to do according to all the law which Moses, my servant, commanded you all the law, all of the Scriptures.
[time=1650] All that God's Word contains. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left so that you may have success.
[time=1658] Wherever you go, this book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.
[time=1669] For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success.
[time=1674] Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you, wherever you go.
[time=1685] Start early, giving your heart to God.
[time=1688] I'm asking you basically this morning to consider one concept, and that is this.
[time=1694] I'll play with my kids when they were, and I've still got a couple of young ones.
[time=1699] I'll take Evie, for instance, she's four.
[time=1702] So with Evie, we'll play on the, wait, the big, huge king-sized bed.
[time=1705] And I'll throw her up on the bed, we'll rough house, and I'll knock her down, and we'll kind of have a good time.
[time=1709] Then she'll sit there on the bed.
[time=1711] And I'll take the huge, the huge bedspread, the huge big blanket, and they love it when I, when I do this, when they're real little, they love.
[time=1718] I take it and I throw the blanket up and I hold on to it, and it kind of spreads out, and then the whole blanket just kind of floats down right over them, and they just get absolutely enveloped.
[time=1728] Just completely covered in the blanket.
[time=1731] And it's just, they just love it. They love being completely, absolutely, no matter where they turn, no matter where they try and go, it's blanket.
[time=1738] They're just covered, and they just giggle and laugh, and I'm asking you to be covered with the Word of God.
[time=1747] To get up in the morning, if you need to, to make a, make time before your head hits the pillow.
[time=1753] To do something at lunch, to maybe do something in between breakfast and lunch, in between lunch and dinner.
[time=1759] And it's not just about reading the scriptures, which I want you to do.
[time=1763] I want you to ask me, I want you to ask your folks, I want you to ask your small group leader, I want you to ask Jesse or anybody on student ministry staff, what can I read?
[time=1771] I want you to read the scriptures, and there may be something else you could read with that that helps the scriptures come alive, but I'm begging you to saturate, to cover your heart and your mind with what's true.
[time=1785] And not just to do it for 15 minutes in the morning, but to with what you see, you can listen to truth.
[time=1791] You can, you can tune in a certain radio station.
[time=1795] You can tune in a certain TV station.
[time=1799] You can, you can tune in lots of things that don't have much truth, gang.
[time=1804] I know.
[time=1805] I hear it too.
[time=1807] Or you can tune in to what's true, and listen to, and watch, and read, and be set.
[time=1815] That big blanket, just, oh, rea, saturated with what's going to fill your heart and help you stay.
[time=1823] How can a young man or woman keep their way pure by keeping it according to what's true?
[time=1830] Now, let me say this to you.
[time=1835] It's a great book.
[time=1836] I showed it to you last week.
[time=1838] It's a great book, not even a hint, not even a hint.
[time=1842] Ephesians 5-3, I'm going to have it come up on the screen here for you.
[time=1846] Ephesians 5-3, this is, this is God's standard, you guys.
[time=1850] This is what I'm asking you in a sense to move toward.
[time=1853] But among you, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality or of any kind of impurity
[time=1860] or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy students.
[time=1866] For God's holy people, not even a hint.
[time=1872] And I'm asking you to draw a really, really big line in your life.
[time=1877] I'm asking you to be, to be wise enough, I'm asking you to just kind of grow up here in a sense
[time=1884] and clear your eyes and be real forthright with yourself and just admit that he is absolutely coming after you.
[time=1892] And for you to respond in a way that's going to allow you to experience what God has for you, you are going to have to draw probably some new lines.
[time=1900] You know what, lines I didn't have to draw when I was your age.
[time=1905] I'm asking you to draw some new lines and to say, you know what, I'm going to stay in a place where I can honor God.
[time=1912] And I'm asking you to just accept the fact that what's going to give you strength to do that is your relationship with him.
[time=1919] I want to read this to you from this book, Joshua Harris wrote this.
[time=1923] Let me read this to you.
[time=1924] And it has to do with not even a hint.
[time=1926] You and I making this effort to move toward purity.
[time=1929] And I want you to think about this.
[time=1931] You and I making this effort.
[time=1934] We must fight fire with fire, he says.
[time=1937] The fire of lust's pleasures must be fought with the fire of God's pleasures.
[time=1943] If we try to fight the fire of lust with prohibitions and I will not, we will fail.
[time=1952] We must fight, we must fight it with the massive promise of superior happiness in Christ.
[time=1959] We must swallow up the little flicker of lust's pleasure in the conflagration.
[time=1965] Big word, but it means the big blanket.
[time=1968] Settling down over you, it means this immense thing, this conflagration of holy satisfaction.
[time=1976] If you try gang, really, really, really, really, really, really hard to be pure,
[time=1983] you will really, really, really, really fail.
[time=1986] If the only thing that's going on there is you and me in our flesh and you
[time=1993] and me in our flesh, any time we're just trying you and me, really, really, really, really hard, we're going to really, really, really fail because it's not about our efforts.
[time=2004] It's about a relationship with him that is deep and growing and real and honest and faithful.
[time=2012] And when you're covered by, when you're surrounded by, when you're saturated by him and his truth,
[time=2019] instead of being covered by, and saturated by, all the stuff that the enemies bring in your way,
[time=2026] then he can be courageous for you.
[time=2030] God offers you and me hope. Listen to this.
[time=2033] God offers you and me hope in a surprising way.
[time=2036] He doesn't tell us to lower our standards to a place where we think we can do it in our own strength.
[time=2041] He calls us to embrace the standard of his word, not even a hint.
[time=2047] God wants us to despair in our own strength so that we have no other option but to throw ourselves on his grace.
[time=2056] That's the mystery of his plan.
[time=2058] You will find his strength in your, what, weakness.
[time=2063] As you despair in yourself, you will find hope in who, him.
[time=2068] And as you turn your back on lust, you will discover that true pleasure is something only God can give.
[time=2076] Start early, gang.
[time=2078] Start early, giving your heart to God.
[time=2081] Draw whatever new lines you need to draw as it relates to radio stations, television, consumption, computer activity,
[time=2089] movies that you see, websites that you visit, and give yourself completely and absolutely to the study and the reading
[time=2099] and the memorizing of God's word and do that with others.
[time=2104] Do that in a small group. Do that here with us as a family.
[time=2107] Do that at 212 or liquid on Wednesday nights or Sunday mornings.
[time=2112] Be saturated.
[time=2114] And you know what?
[time=2116] Be good with it.
[time=2118] Don't let me stand here.
[time=2120] Don't let anybody ever take what I just said and paint that as you being weird.
[time=2126] Or paint that as you being some kind of fanatic.
[time=2130] No, no, no.
[time=2131] See, that's you being wise because you, without that, you, without that kind of approach, you're going to get absolutely slaughtered.
[time=2140] It's not weird.
[time=2142] It's good.
[time=2143] And we want to do everything we can to support you and come alongside you in that endeavor.
[time=2148] Start early, giving your heart to God.
[time=2150] Start late.
[time=2151] Start late, giving your heart to another.
[time=2154] We mentioned it the last few weeks.
[time=2156] I want to just mention it one more time.
[time=2158] Satan's thrown most of his eggs in one basket.
[time=2160] You guys, it's called sex.
[time=2162] He wants to ruin and destroy your lives by getting you to pervert God's design for sexual activity and relationship.
[time=2171] God made that.
[time=2172] That's a good thing.
[time=2173] Shouldn't be embarrassed about it.
[time=2174] It's a good topic.
[time=2175] It's all about what he designed for a man and a woman in the confines of what Hebrews 13 is.
[time=2182] In the confines of what Hebrews 13 calls the marriage bed.
[time=2186] It's a good thing.
[time=2188] God said it's a good thing for here.
[time=2191] God's word says it's going to ruin you.
[time=2193] It will ruin you if somehow you try and experiment with that or toy with that or go in that direction over here.
[time=2202] You've got, oh gosh, they're probably all swallowed up.
[time=2205] There's stacks of paper up there.
[time=2207] Somewhere around, yeah, there's stacks of paper, pass them out.
[time=2211] Everybody get a piece of paper.
[time=2213] Everybody pass that paper around and everybody get a piece of paper and hold on to it real quick.
[time=2217] Let me just say this to the rest of you while the paper's getting passed out.
[time=2221] The issue with sexual purity isn't physical.
[time=2224] You may think, wait a minute, what?
[time=2226] I want to just make sure we make this point this morning.
[time=2228] The issue, the fundamental issue with sexual purity, sexual activity, the fundamental issue is not physical.
[time=2236] It is emotional.
[time=2237] That's the fundamental primary issue here.
[time=2240] In inappropriate sexual contact, damages and wounds, the body?
[time=2247] Well, yeah, in some ways, but first and foremost, and at a much deeper level, inappropriate sexual contact, activity, involvement, damages and wounds, the heart.
[time=2260] And the soul gets tweaked when we choose to go outside of God's design.
[time=2269] Any honest adult in the room this morning, any adult in this room who's ever been down that road,
[time=2279] and thank God for his redeeming love and the grace that he brings and the way he heals hearts and souls.
[time=2286] But any honest adult in this room would testify to that very truth, I believe,
[time=2292] that there is something that goes on at the heart and soul level that isn't good, that is not healthy.
[time=2298] It's not what God designed when we choose to go outside those parameters.
[time=2302] Bodies get affected, yes.
[time=2305] Hearts and souls get wounded.
[time=2307] And you know what?
[time=2309] Hold your papers up right in front of your heart.
[time=2311] Thank you.
[time=2313] I just made this up this week, so I hope it works.
[time=2317] Here's what happens.
[time=2318] Everybody got a piece of paper?
[time=2320] Hold it up there right on your heart there.
[time=2323] See, I just just visually, I just like that.
[time=2329] If we're talking about a heart, there's just something about a nice clean sheet, right?
[time=2336] And the great thing is, is that God allows us, you know, he gives us choice.
[time=2340] He gives us his design, he calls us to live by that design, and then he gives us choice.
[time=2345] And so what happens sometimes is that you and I, we move outside of God's design as it relates to the physical.
[time=2352] And choice is getting made, and we end up in situations and stuff happens, and everybody just take your paper and just rip it right down the half.
[time=2360] Boom.
[time=2369] And so then we got, then we got this.
[time=2372] Hold it up like this, you guys.
[time=2375] Hold it up.
[time=2377] So something happens, we make a choice, we go where we shouldn't have gone, we get outside of God's design, and as it relates to the physical, sexual arena, we end up with a heart kind of torn in half.
[time=2386] But hey, not to worry, right?
[time=2388] Because all I got to do is just kind of put it back together, and then you just kind of hold it there at the top and the bottom, and there, I'm okay, right?
[time=2398] Heart's good, good shape.
[time=2401] I mean, how do we do?
[time=2403] Can't really tell, can you?
[time=2405] Oh, well, kind of.
[time=2408] Yeah, sort of.
[time=2410] It's kind of okay, right?
[time=2412] Now, and now I'm going to go on with my life, but while I'm going on with my life, I'm going to have to give a little extra effort to kind of keeping this thing together because it's kind of coming apart a little bit, but I'm going to be alright because it's just once, and I just think I got it back where it should be.
[time=2425] But then what happens is, but see, then it doesn't happen just once.
[time=2430] See, then sometimes it happens again, and I just want you to take your two pieces, and I just want you to stack one on top of the other, and I just want you to just share the thing again.
[time=2440] And then I'm thinking, oh my goodness, well, okay, there, I'll just, I'll kind of put it back, then I'm going to get, I'm going to put it back together.
[time=2448] I think I can, I'll just put it back together, I think it's going to be alright.
[time=2454] How's it look?
[time=2455] You can't really tell anything, can you?
[time=2459] Yeah, you kind of can, can't you?
[time=2463] How you guys doing?
[time=2464] Hold up there, let me see how you're doing there.
[time=2466] Yeah, how the heart's doing?
[time=2469] A little broken, a little tattered, a little messy.
[time=2475] Make sense? And I'm going to keep trying here.
[time=2478] I'm going to keep, I'm going to keep trying to hold on to this thing.
[time=2481] I'm going to somehow try and get it to be like it's supposed to be, but is it going to be like it's supposed to be like this?
[time=2488] No, it's all messed up.
[time=2494] And so I'm just, thank you for bearing with me on the paper thing.
[time=2499] You can just put those down.
[time=2502] I'm asking you guys, listen, I'm asking you, I am, I'm begging you to just spend some years, most of you sitting up here, you know, 12, 13, 14 up to, you know, 18, 20 year olds.
[time=2517] Some of the 18, 19, 20 year olds, you're probably moving in the next few, you know, next little bit here, you may be moving on to significant relationship opportunities.
[time=2528] I mean that, I mean significant relationship opportunities where maybe you're going to have an opportunity to actually begin to know what it means to love someone and experience a relationship.
[time=2540] And all that comes with that and the character and the integrity and the honesty that's needed.
[time=2545] And for those of you in that boat, I say, keep us in the loop, stay involved with your parents and God bless you as you begin to go down that road.
[time=2554] And I want to do everything we can to help you be successful in a God honoring way with another man or another woman, however that works for you.
[time=2561] But here's the deal, the rest of you, you got a ways.
[time=2565] And I'm begging you to start late.
[time=2567] I'm begging you to play sports, read books, work on science, plan a garden, help your folks in the yard, go to church, be involved in ministry, use your gifts, go out with a bunch of friends.
[time=2582] Guys and girls, it's fine, but stay together as a group, stay away from the he's mind, stay away from the, I'm hers.
[time=2591] Stay away from the exclusivity that forces you mentally and then ultimately physically to have to be in situations you don't need to be.
[time=2599] And I'm begging you, start late.
[time=2602] And in doing so, if you're starting early on the Word of God thing, if you're growing in your relationship with him, is there more paper up there?
[time=2611] Or is it all gone?
[time=2612] If there's more paper up there, pass out paper one more time, everybody get a piece of paper because I've talked to you about starting early, I've talked to you about starting late, and I want to just say this, sometimes it's time to start over.
[time=2625] Give your wounded heart to God, give your wounded heart to God, and with your new piece of paper, hold it up there, there you go.
[time=2635] I don't know, listen, gang, I don't know where the broken, tattered, shattered pieces are, right?
[time=2642] I hope they're on the ground somewhere, but forget about them, because here's the deal.
[time=2646] No matter, listen, no matter what you've done, no matter where you've gone, no matter what you've done, no matter where you've gone, David, King David, a man after God's own heart did a despicable thing.
[time=2662] And we find his confession in Psalm 51 2, I'm going to ask Corbin and the team to come on up at this time.
[time=2668] Psalm 51 2 says, wash me thoroughly, hold those papers up, hold those papers up over your hearts, there you go.
[time=2675] No matter where you've gone, it can be pure, and not just pure, it can be whole again, no rips, no tears.
[time=2683] And I want to encourage each and every one of you on stage this morning, whoever you are, to confess whatever might need to be confessed, to make right whatever might need to be made right, and enjoy.
[time=2695] Look what it says here, wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
[time=2700] It says in Psalm 51 later in verses 10 to 12, it says, create in me a clean heart, there it is, clean, whole. It can work again.
[time=2709] Create in me, David says a clean heart. Oh God, and renew a steadfast spirit in me.
[time=2714] Restore unto me, do not cast me away from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.
[time=2720] Then it says in verse 12, restore to me the joy of your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.
[time=2727] A new piece of paper, a new opportunity. Thanks you guys, you can put those down and just listen here for a moment.
[time=2734] Here's what we're going to do. I want to give everybody in the room this morning.
[time=2738] We want to give everybody here an opportunity to respond, and Corbin's going to sing a song here in just a moment.
[time=2747] And it is such a powerful song, it's one of my favorite songs in the last, I don't know, four, three, four, five years.
[time=2754] It's just a powerful, powerful song that speaks to this very issue.
[time=2758] And we want to give you a chance as a family to respond to what we've heard over these five weeks.
[time=2764] I want to give all of you, I want to give all of you up here today an opportunity to respond.
[time=2769] Any of you young people out in the audience who didn't come up, it's okay, no big deal.
[time=2773] We want to give you a chance to respond. But as Corbin prepares to sing this song, here's what I want you to think through with me.
[time=2780] We've wanted there to be a discussion here and a chance to look to God's word over these last few weeks.
[time=2786] And one thing I know that I've learned as I've gone through this with you is that there's this mixture, there's this that we can do, there are these choices that we can make.
[time=2795] There are these adjustments that we can bring with his help into our lives and into our homes.
[time=2801] There's a class you can take in two weeks. There's CDs you can order and re-listen to.
[time=2806] There are things that we can do on this front that will, I think, help us and encourage us.
[time=2812] New lines can get drawn, really big ones, that say I'm not going there.
[time=2818] I'm starting early, I'm starting late, and wherever I fail I'm going to start over.
[time=2822] There is this part that he allows us to do. Then there's this huge thing over here called God, his grace and his great love, and his enormous commitment to you and I.
[time=2834] And we want to just try our best to bring those two things together this morning.
[time=2838] There's a song that Corbin's going to sing, it's called "Spoken For." And we want to just declare this morning as a family.
[time=2846] I think when we first talked about this morning we kind of, we thought of a title to the morning that would be spoken for.
[time=2855] Satan, get your hands off our kids.
[time=2858] And we know that in and of ourselves we can't do that, but we know that in Christ.
[time=2864] And we know that under the umbrella of God's protection and love and guidance, much can be done.
[time=2870] And so we're going to ask you to do this, adults in the room, your chance is this.
[time=2874] There's going to be like, come down here to the front like you would for communion, back in the back like you would for communion up top as you would for communion.
[time=2882] There will be folks with baskets and adults in the room.
[time=2886] We're asking that you as a family go or you as an individual, go with those that you're with and take one card.
[time=2892] And on those cards are the names, names of our kids, all of our kids.
[time=2898] Every kid in this place, young ones, middle school and high school ones, even college age kids, there's a name on that card.
[time=2906] Well, don't look for your kid's name, just pick a card.
[time=2910] And we're asking you as a family to take that card and to pray, there's ways that you can pray, pray what's on that card for that kid.
[time=2918] Pray for God's protection, pray for wisdom on their behalf.
[time=2922] But would you as a family please get up in a moment here and go and get a card.
[time=2927] And be willing to, for the remainder of the school year, once, twice, three times a day, pray for that life.
[time=2935] Remember that that name represents not just a life, more than likely it represents a home.
[time=2941] Pray for them.
[time=2943] For all you students, for all you kids, and any kid in the room this morning, from the littlest one who can understand me, all the way up to the college age, we want you to come forward.
[time=2954] You guys can sit tight and we're going to have some folks come up on stage for this, but we've got armed wristbands for you.
[time=2960] And these wristbands, for all these kids, these wristbands say on it, spoken for.
[time=2965] And the thought there is just, it's just a picture I have in my mind.
[time=2973] I told you a month or two ago about my dad.
[time=2976] When I got bullied by some guys on a bike, remember that?
[time=2980] I don't know if you were here, but I got bullied by some guys when I was riding my bike and I went home and told my dad.
[time=2986] They followed me home and I'll never forget the feeling of my dad running out the front door, because he saw him and my dad was a big guy.
[time=2995] And I'm there for getting running out behind him.
[time=2998] And I don't know what he said, but he's kind of waving his finger and he stood there right behind him.
[time=3004] And I felt strong and I felt protected.
[time=3009] And it was like my dad kind of flexed on these guys.
[time=3014] It was like he spread his arms out and flexed his muscle and said no, no, no, you don't mess with this kid.
[time=3021] He's spoken for him. He's mine.
[time=3024] And these kids, every young person in this room needs the reality of a Heavenly Father whose love is so great and so pervasive.
[time=3033] And the love of a parent, adults in their life, they're willing to stand for them and say no, no, no.
[time=3038] We're going to put our arms around these kids. We're going to do everything we can to live, not a hint.
[time=3045] Lives. We're going to stand with them. And so we've got wristbands.
[time=3049] And any kid in the room, come on down and get a wristband when Corbin starts to sing.
[time=3055] And then all the kids are going to join us on stage and we're going to pray for them as we go.
[time=3060] Please get a card and listen to these words. It's a great, great tune.
[time=3064] It's a great song with such great truth. Let's listen.
[time=3067] And as he sings, adults, please go get your cards.
[time=3070] Kids, come on down and get a wristband and join us on stage.
[time=3094] Take this world for me. I don't need it anymore.
[time=3115] I'm fine for free. My heart is spoken for.
[time=3125] Oh, and I praise you. Oh, and I worship you.
[time=3139] Covered by love divine, child of the reason why.
[time=3151] Do you hear the same? This one's fine.
[time=3157] My heart is spoken for.
[time=3169] Now I have peace that I've never known before.
[time=3187] I find myself complete for my heart is spoken for.
[time=3198] Oh, and I praise you. Oh, and I worship you.
[time=3211] Covered by love divine, child of the reason why.
[time=3223] Do you hear the same? This one's fine.
[time=3229] Child is spoken for.
[time=3235] By the power of the cross, You've taken what was lost.
[time=3249] You've taken what was lost, You've taken what was lost.
[time=3291] You've taken what was lost, You've taken what was lost, You've taken what was lost.
[time=3329] You've taken what was lost, You've taken what was lost.
[time=3351] You've taken what was lost, You've taken what was lost, You've taken what was lost, You've
[time=3377] taken what was lost.
[time=3401] I've taken what was lost, You've taken what was lost, You've taken what was lost, You've
