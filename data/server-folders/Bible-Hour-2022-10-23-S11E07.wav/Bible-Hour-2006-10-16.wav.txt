[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[time=32] and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=39] "Teaching and getting to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=50] Helping seekers find and follow Christ."
[time=74] "I walk up on the morning, and I walk down on the moon.
[time=79] My eyes were very open, and my mouth began to yawn, picked up a board of paper, every
[time=88] single headline said, "That this old world is full of trouble, and I wish that state
[time=95] man has some times the doubt that's going on to know to bring you down."
[time=105] "Turn on my television, and begin to flip on through all one hundred channels, HBO and
[time=115] the whole world, I heard the Father say, 'Don't forget what I have promised, you can't
[time=131] overcome it all.' The story is about to break, and let's go on the beat, and take the truth, the truth,
[time=157] the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth,
[time=606] close to these four T's and that the Bible is good for that. To teach, to train, to test,
[time=612] I think it says rebuke in 2 Timothy 3 16 and to correct or to transform. And so the Bible
[time=618] used humbly and modeled in our own lives is what gets through to our kids. So let God
[time=626] do what only God can do is you watch this and maybe get out your own Bible and look at the verses that I share and thank you so much for joining us. We're here every Sunday morning for two services 9 a.m. and 1045 a.m. and Wednesday nights for totally separate gathering.
[time=641] It's called common ground for worship and prayer and a message that usually I give and those are Wednesday nights at 6.45 and we're done before 8.15 p.m. Thank you so much for joining us.

[time=895] Amen. This is a joyful song. Just reach down in your heart. I'm going to sing this.
[time=924] Reach down in your heart and let it come out. To God be the glory. To God be the glory
[time=934] great things he has done. So long he's the world that he gave us his son who killed him
[time=941] in his life and had told them for sin and opened the life gates and all they go in.
[time=949] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the earth hear his voice. Praise the
[time=960] Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the people rejoice. Oh come to the Father through Jesus the son

[time=991] believes that moment from Jesus apart and received. Great things. Great things. He has

[time=1103] son. And give in the glory great things he has done. Amen.
[time=1113] Thank you Corbin team. I'm Mitch. I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and
[time=1119] today will be an epilogue to kidnapped. An epilogue to the series on kidnapped. You know I was
[time=1125] thinking about the problem just in one word with our next generation and with us is sin
[time=1132] desiring life apart from God. So I've asked my four daughters if they would come up here please and help me illustrate what the Bible shows is the four predominant ways that we
[time=1145] sent. There are four ways that we sent and we're going to use a basketball analogy. Would you grab the girls ball please Maggie. And we're going to use a basketball analogy to show you.
[time=1153] It's four different Greek words. It's very interesting. The context and the usages. And so they all
[time=1159] decided to join me to help me do this. And we'll just see how it goes with Haley. This is Haley's
[time=1165] third birthday today. Right there. Happy birthday baby.
[time=1173] And Maggie's going to show us the first way. Meghan plays for Lakewood Park Christian School. She's 16. That's a scary thought in of itself. She's a junior and I helped coach
[time=1185] her. And Meghan was like I think the leading scorer of freshman year and she was one of the leading rebounders in the state last year and she's worked really hard this summer. And Meghan we're going to make it we like to simulate game experiences. So you're going to be the opposing crowd as Meghan simulates a free throw. So you're ready? Okay. Come on. You're the opposing crowd.
[time=1203] Louder. Louder.
[time=1211] Hey.
[time=1215] Now when Michael Jordan steps up to the line and he makes 88 out of 100. He is not
[time=1221] missing the 12 on purpose that he misses. He misses when he's trying to make it. And that's the first one.
[time=1227] I want you to write that down. We miss the mark. Meghan is trying to make it and she misses. Now how many people can identify with that in your life?
[time=1235] I mean we just no matter what it is. No matter what it is in life. Whether it's shooting a basketball or just
[time=1241] you know saying something the way it ought to be said. We miss the mark.
[time=1245] It's interesting. There's the Greek word for it and Romans 3 23 says all have sinned. This is this use of the Greek word.
[time=1253] All have sinned and fall short. They shoot the shot short. All do it.
[time=1257] But it's interesting that with each one of these sin words is a context of grace used with that word.
[time=1265] And so the Romans 6 23 talks about grace. For the wages of sin of missing the mark is death or separation from God. But the gift of God by grace is eternal life in Christ our Lord. So that's the first way that we sin is missing the mark. We try to make it and we miss.
[time=1285] Second way. Kelsey. Well come on up. This is Kelsey. She's my seventh grader.
[time=1289] Her first organizer of basketball was last year and she had just a really fun coach and that's me.
[time=1297] And she had a great season. I cannot believe some of the things I saw out of her. She's been working hard all summer long and she's going to come up and show us this second way that we sinned. Go ahead Kelsey.
[time=1309] You missed it. I made it. You missed it.
[time=1313] I made that. Do it again.
[time=1317] You missed it. I made it. You missed it. I made that.
[time=1321] Man you're a good actress.
[time=1325] Second way is we twist a right. I'm sorry we twist a wrong. See I do it even when I say it. We twist a wrong to make it right.
[time=1333] We twist a wrong to make it right. Kelsey missed.
[time=1337] See that spider? I can't stand there anymore.
[time=1341] Kelsey missed and she told everybody she made it. She twisted a wrong to make it right. Do you ever do that in your life? Get a little too far down that road if something you did wrong and you start to well it was really good that I did that you know. We start going down that road. Well look at the uses of it in scripture.
[time=1357] 1 John 5 17 says all wrongdoing is sin. All twisting wrongs to make them right is sin. Romans 1 18 says that this same word for sin that we're using for this this suppresses the truth. She suppresses the truth that she actually missed it and tells everybody she made it. But then there's a grace context and the grace context is 1 John 1 9 if we confess our sins. If we confess the wrongs that we twisted to try to say that they were right he is faithful and just by grace and will forgive us by grace our sins and purifies from all in righteousness a sin usage and a grace usage. What is she doing now?
[time=1401] She knows your next. Good job. Good job.
[time=1405] Lily's going to demonstrate. Lily's my kinder gardener. She's just learning how to shoot I'm sorry she's my first grader. She's just learning how to shoot and Lily's going to show us the third way that we sin.
[time=1417] Lily faith. No make it. Let's go make it.
[time=1421] Lily.
[time=1425] Can you give that to daddy? Thank you. What's Lily doing?
[time=1429] Missing on purpose.
[time=1433] Missing on purpose. Now she doesn't have too much of a problem with this in her life.
[time=1437] Anomia. No law.
[time=1441] Mrs. Anomia's law. It's breaking the law. It's about a yardstick. It's going bam.
[time=1445] I'm saying no go. I don't care what God says. I don't care what the Bible says.
[time=1449] I'm just going to do this anyway. Here's the sin verse. Here's the use of this word.
[time=1453] Everyone who sins breaks the law.
[time=1457] No law. And that's lawlessness. But there's a grace passage. Blessed are those. Blessed are they who's transgressions.
[time=1465] Those who break the law say no law are forgiven. Their sins are covered by grace. That same word for sin has a grace passage with it.
[time=1473] And it's so interesting. So Megan missed the mark.
[time=1477] She tried to make it and she missed. Kelsey twisted her wrong to make it right.
[time=1481] She missed and told everybody she made it. And then Lily missed on purpose with style I would say. And then here's the fourth way. Ready baby?
[time=1489] Okay. Now go ahead and knock it in.
[time=1493] What does she do? Why'd she do that?
[time=1497] Here you go. All right go ahead.
[time=1501] Can I cooperate here?
[time=1505] Here we go.
[time=1509] We don't shoot at all. Good job.
[time=1513] Which she didn't shoot at all first hour.
[time=1517] It worked great. Now she's kind of getting into the motive of her sister.
[time=1521] Then that's leaving good undone. Leaving good undone. Do you ever do that?
[time=1525] You ever just walk by the person in need and work, church, play and just leave good undone.
[time=1535] It's a different word but the context is the same.
[time=1539] James 4 17 says anyone then who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it sins. The use of this word is in Ephesians 2. You were dead doing nothing in your sin and transgressions. And it goes on to verse 5 and gives us the grace
[time=1557] to go with it. But God made us alive with Christ even though we were dead doing nothing in our sins. It is by grace you have been saved. Each one is a sin passage. Each one has a grace passage. Grace undeserved love unmerited favor. And for the girls helping me they're all going to get grace. All right so you ready?
[time=1581] Happy birthday. You want to give me a kiss?
[time=1585] That'll be done.
[time=1589] I want you. No. See that's what we do. I want more grace. There you go Lily. There you go Lily.
[time=1597] Maggie thank you and Kelsey thank you. So let's thank them.
[time=1609] Well when James Naismith invented basketball at a YMCA there was a track that went around it.
[time=1617] And today I want to talk about that track where we run the race. Paul called it next 2024 the gospel of grace. I run the race and the race is testifying to the gospel of God's grace. And grace surrounds that sin in our lives when we're in Christ and it wins.
[time=1637] And when we surrender our lives to Christ we have his spirit capital S his spirit in us. Galatians 5 17 says there's this conflict inside of us. We have this spirit of Christ in us capital S spirit of Christ in us and it's in conflict with sin. This missing the mark twist and wrongs and make it right. What's the other one? Miss it on purpose and leaving good undone.
[time=1661] And then it dawned on me when I was studying that discipline really is the steering wheel of grace. Discipline and disciple comes from the same reward it means learner means learner. And God's design is that we would be disciples of Christ and that we would discipline in our lives for that grace to abound in our lives. The unmerited favor undeserved love in our lives and that spirit of Christ is victorious.
[time=1693] And discipline, discipleship is the driver's seat. And we're going to look at four turns around the track, the four turns of discipline or of discipleship.
[time=1705] And if we don't do any one of these then we don't make a complete lap in the testifying to God's grace with discipline. We fall short in discipline and the result is relational wreckage.
[time=1721] To give you a story to kind of kick this off, I was doing a charity auction in Bokerton, Florida for the Bokerton Community Hospital. And I did auction about 20-some items and I did the whole auction with NASCAR driver now a color commentator Rusty Wallace. And Rusty was on his last year of driving and he got all excited and fired up about it and he had donated a race suit which I sold for more than any one of his race suits I'd ever sold for and he gets all fired up over that and he says, "You know what, okay, okay, okay." And he starts adding things to the auction. He said, "I'll add an honorary pit crew. You can be on my pit crew at Daytona. Have a suit." He goes, "You can stay on the owner's yacht and the water right there outside the track. It'll just be awesome. It brings a whole bunch of money." And we have a big exciting night and we raise a whole bunch more money than they thought and we just go our separate ways after doing the charity auction together. And the lady about 90-some years old walks up to me afterwards. And she said, "Rusty, my husband over there says you'll autograph my checkered flag." And I didn't know quite for sure if she was talking to me because she called me Rusty.
[time=1785] And the guy with me who brought me down, he said, "That's not rusty.
[time=1789] Wallace, that's Mitch Crews. He's a classic car auctioneer.
[time=1793] He's not the race car driver." She goes, "Will you sign this?" And I said, "You want me to sign it as Rusty or as Mitch?" She goes, "Who are you?" And the guy goes, "He's Mitch Crews. The auction's collector car." She goes, "I bought one from you at an auction." I said, "Do you still want me to sign the flag?" She said, "Yeah." I said, "Is Rusty or is Mitch?" She said, "Is Mitch." So I signed it.
[time=1821] And as I'm walking out, there's this 90-some-year-old guy right by the door.
[time=1825] He's got glasses this thick. And he looks up and he goes, "Thanks Rusty!" Here's the deal.
[time=1833] Because I worked with, it was seen walking with, it was seen talking with Rusty Wallace, they thought I was Rusty Wallace.
[time=1845] Jesus' disciples were seen working with, talking with, walking with Jesus. And they were called disciples.
[time=1853] Disciples, so much so that detractors mockingly called them Christians.
[time=1861] They modeled Christ, the disciples modeled Christ.
[time=1865] Our kids are going to model something.
[time=1869] Our kids are going to be disciples of something. If we own a business, our workers are going to be modeling something. And today's message is the grace of discipline, the grace of discipleship.
[time=1881] And it comes from Proverbs. I looked at the Hebrew word and it's usage, it's called Muscar, and in Proverbs, all the way through.
[time=1889] And I found this pattern. And some of the exciting things I saw was, I found this pattern that we're going to see in the life of Christ.
[time=1897] It was amazing to me and how he made disciples. It was also kind of surprising to me.
[time=1901] Maybe it shouldn't have been, but I found this pattern modeled in my parents, in me. Very interesting to me.
[time=1909] And so therefore I'm trying to do this with my kids.
[time=1913] But it's also the pattern for coaching, for business, for success in anything, is what you're going to see right now.
[time=1921] And let me just give it to you real quick. The turn one is to teach.
[time=1925] Bob Purdy helped me with these definitions when I put this together about a year and a half ago for Common Ground during a series on wisdom.
[time=1933] But first thing when you do is teach. I do, you watch.
[time=1937] We'll look at that. Second thing we do is train.
[time=1941] I do, you help.
[time=1945] Third thing we do is test.
[time=1949] Test. You do, I help.
[time=1953] You do, I help.
[time=1957] And then to transform or to correct, you do, I watch. You do, I watch.
[time=1965] Discipline or discipleship, learning, is one of the key 12 words on why Proverbs is written.
[time=1973] And we find that in verse 3 of Proverbs. It says that I'm writing you this for discipline to occur in your life. And then our main text is Proverbs 3, 11, and 12. So if you want to turn there Proverbs 3, 11, and 12. And it says, "My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent his rebuke because the Lord disciplines those he loves as a father, the son he delights in." Look at that now. Discipline and love.
[time=2001] Discipline and grace go together.
[time=2005] Discipline is the steering wheel of grace.
[time=2009] And we need to make four turns in our lives. And if we don't make all four turns leave anyone out and it's incomplete and we'll experience life outside the boundaries of what Christ designed of discipleship and we'll have relational wreckage in our lives. So let's look at the first one to teach.
[time=2025] Teach, "I do you watch." To teach, "I do you watch." Proverbs 1-8 says it this way. "Listen, my son, do your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.
[time=2037] The idea, the usage here of discipline, is that it's taught from parents to children." Let's look at that second verse. 16-20 in Proverbs. "Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers and blessed is he who trusts in the Lord." There's this idea that if I'm taught and I'm teachable that good things happen. And there's this picture of parents being an agent of God. That God teaches me through my parents that my role as a parent is to teach my kids.
[time=2069] I do you watch. My mom and dad did this with me. My mom and dad did this with me. I remember I still have it. The Bible storybook that my great grandfather and grandmother read to my grandfather and his three siblings. And then he used it my grandfather to teach my dad. And then my mom and dad used to do it and I would watch. They used to read. One would read it to me while the other one would act it out and I can remember that. I also remember watching my dad pray on his knees. I remember watching them go to church. I remember watching them read the Bible.
[time=2113] And it wasn't just geared to Bible, church, and prayer was geared to all of life.
[time=2121] That your behavior would move with the Bible, prayers, and church.
[time=2125] And my dad would get me up every Saturday morning and make me go to an auction.
[time=2129] Actually several auctions. Either in the horrible heat or just shivering cold. I probably got frostbite to this day because of how my dad did not parent very well by helping me out there with not warm clothes on.
[time=2141] I got that out of the way. So I try to do the same thing.
[time=2145] I try to do the same thing. I got a storybook Bible and I've done a different one with each daughter and this lilies in this stage right now and Haley's now going to come into it. But this is one of the best ones I've ever seen. I talked about it once before. It's the Young Learner's Bible Storybook.
[time=2161] The Young Learner's Bible Storybook. And the thing I like about is that the stories are good, they're short, and they include all of life. She doesn't just learn the Bible. She learns prepositions. She learns colors. She learns numbers.
[time=2177] She learns the six basic kinds of machines. Which I'm still trying to memorize.
[time=2181] I thought that was really cool. I didn't know that happened. The world was that way. And there's all kinds of things.
[time=2185] And here I've learned because we do this. But here's how it starts out. I do.
[time=2189] She watches. I read. She watches.
[time=2193] This was Jesus's model. Jesus taught his disciples. You can look at it in Luke 10. Jesus taught his disciples. He did and they watched.
[time=2205] My question for you today is what are your kids watching you do? That's what you're teaching them.
[time=2213] Write it down. What are my kids watching me do? Well turn one is teach.
[time=2221] I do you watch. Turn two is train. I do you help.
[time=2225] Proverbs 22-6. Very familiar verse. Train a child in the way he should go. It's unique. Each of my girls is unique.
[time=2233] And when he is old he will not turn from it. Training.
[time=2237] I do you help.
[time=2241] I do you help. My mom and dad. I remember my mom and dad training me how to pray. They would do it and I would help.
[time=2253] I remember with the Bible storybook that I started to help them.
[time=2257] Now I didn't just watch. They would do the story and then I would help.
[time=2261] But it wasn't just with the Bible and with prayer and with church. I would even help in church. My mom taught Sunday school for years.
[time=2269] And I would help until she didn't want me in there anymore. And that kind of thing happened in church. But it happened in all of life.
[time=2277] My dad would take me to auctions and he would make me carry clerk sheets. That's kind of an interesting way I just said that. He would make me carry clerk sheets. And a clerk sheet had the item, the bidders name or number, the price. And there were 14 sheets or 14 items on a page and I would carry that from where the auction was to the cashier.
[time=2297] Look I was the forerunner of an email. But think about it.
[time=2301] And back in the old days when that's what you did. And I got paid 10 cents a clerk sheet and I negotiated a minimum of a dollar a day.
[time=2309] And that's the way we did that. And I did that through elementary school. I was really young starting this out.
[time=2313] And that's the way life was. So I tried to do the same thing.
[time=2319] I throw my kids in the car for whatever I'm doing.
[time=2323] Teaching, preaching, auctions, coaching, whatever it is.
[time=2327] I include them as much as I can, as much as it's appropriate to come watch and then to come help. I do you help.
[time=2335] I've served, I have the opportunity to serve other people here who serve the poor.
[time=2339] And I've thrown Kelsey in the car for those.
[time=2343] And the talks that we've had, I make her talk to me all the way there and all the way back.
[time=2347] And the talks that we've had and the experience that we've had in this training process has been priceless. And the same thing is true at this stage.
[time=2355] You know, I do it, but then Lily, as she got older, she starts helping me do it.
[time=2363] This was Jesus's model.
[time=2367] Jesus had his disciples work right alongside him. He did. They helped.
[time=2371] I do you help. My question for you today is, what are your kids helping you do? Because that's the training they're getting.
[time=2383] Write it down. What are my kids helping me do? We don't set kids out to drive without some kind of training. But yet it seems like we send them out to steer their own lives without training in the discipleship of Christ.
[time=2403] Third turn is to test, to test. Testing is you do I help. Now to the kid we say you do, the child I help. You do. I help.
[time=2419] It's giving them, if you want to write this down, an opportunity to succeed or fail. It's putting them actually in it to have an opportunity to succeed or fail. And then the heat of the intensity of the experience brings the impurities to the top. This is the picture that Proverbs gives us on this issue. Proverbs 17-3 talks about a refiner's fire. The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tests Hebrew word for discipline, the heart. The Lord tests the heart. God gives us, puts us out in the experience. And then the impurities rise to the top. Proverbs 27-21. The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but man is tested by the praise he receives. A real good way to see if your kids are getting what you're trying to teach, train, and test and transform them is to see how they handle praise.
[time=2475] How do they handle praise? Do they take the credit for it?
[time=2479] Do they give it to someone else? How do they handle that? Proverbs 8-10 says it this way to choose my instruction.
[time=2487] We got to give our kids a choice to do it themselves, to experience it. And it's funny that the refiner's fire thing, the biggest impurities don't come out until the heat's been going on for a long time. That's when the biggest impurities, to make pure metal and to have it unmixed and be pure and have the impurities come out, it's the longest heat and the deepest impurities come out last. So they got to have opportunities to succeed or fail and to choose discipline for themselves. If in basketball, for example, if teaching is, you know, I do, you watch, and then training is, we give them drills, I do, you help. Testing, you do, I help. It would be scrimmage. It would be a game. We actually look at that and watch the impurities come to the top.
[time=2539] And it's the experience, the intensity of the experience that brings those to light, to the top, to the surface.
[time=2547] My dad and mom did that with me.
[time=2551] I taught in church at a, I spoke a lot in church at a very young age.
[time=2555] I helped lead some little programs. It was just a little country church at a very young age. They helped me do that. So I tried to do the same thing with my kids. Megan, it was helping, was teaching an elementary age Sunday school class, helping teach an elementary age Sunday school. I just went with their one day to help.
[time=2575] I wanted to see it. I want to see what was going on there.
[time=2579] I try to put my kids in situations because what's been passed down, the philosophy has been passed down, and my lineage is your job as a parent is to get yourself out of a job.
[time=2591] Your job as a parent is to get yourself out of a job. So my vision, like for Christian schools and schools of all kinds, is to have the kids be the ones doing the concession stands, teach, train, test, have the kids be doing the prayers, have the kids be singing the national anthem, have the kids learn about the business of the ticket sales, and implement the kids and let them succeed or fail all in the form of the complete track of discipline, the testing, and then the transforming.
[time=2623] My dad mom did it with me.
[time=2627] They did it with me, and now I do it with my kids. In the auction world, it's kind of like this. My dad would have me...
[time=2635] My dad had me auctioned when I was 18.
[time=2639] That's when you could get your license, and then he would like put me in that fire, and he would help me. And my grandfather would do that too. And I was auctioning a curio cabinet in Butler, Indiana out in the front lawn on the main drag through there. And I'll never forget this.
[time=2655] I was going $100, $150, anybody else? And my grandfather just about reaches, he just about chokes me, grabs this way, why what are you doing?
[time=2663] I said, I'm going to sell it for $100? Yeah! No!
[time=2667] I said, why? He said, can you think of something about this cabinet that you would tell them that would make it bring more?
[time=2675] I said, well, I noticed that the wood feet are really uniquely carved.
[time=2679] It's very unique down there. I've really never seen one like it. He goes, don't tell me, tell them.
[time=2683] 150, 200, 250, 350, anybody else?
[time=2687] I said, what? Stop! Are you going to sell it for that? I go, well, I was.
[time=2691] Any else you could tell them about it? I said, well, the bevel glass, it's really beautiful.
[time=2695] Never seen bevel glass like that. Probably they don't probably make that like that anymore.
[time=2699] I bet it was really expensive to do it. It goes, don't tell me, tell them. So I tell them.
[time=2703] 400, 450, 500, 550, 650, 650, anybody else? Wait, wait! Stop! Stop!
[time=2707] I said, what? He goes, can you think of something else? I said, well, the hand car wood all around it is really gorgeous. And then it was refinished. I mean, he goes, don't tell me, tell them.
[time=2715] I tell him, 850, 950, a thousand.
[time=2719] Can I sell it now? Yeah, sold a thousand dollars.
[time=2723] What I was going to sell for a hundred dollars brought a thousand, but because in the testing process,
[time=2729] I learned, and in the heat of the intensity of the experience, the impurities came to top, came to the top.
[time=2735] And I was able to be tested there in a way that was meaningful to the discipline and the discipleship in my life.
[time=2741] And you know, on the way up, what I didn't tell you as I was auctioning that he told me, he said, Mitchell, if I can get you convinced.
[time=2747] You convinced. I can get them convinced.
[time=2751] God is saying to you as a parent, if I can get you convinced, I can get your child convinced to be a disciple of Christ.
[time=2759] You do. I help. Lily now takes me through this.
[time=2763] And I help her.
[time=2765] She leads the way.
[time=2767] She decides we're going to do it.
[time=2769] That's really kind of cool. You know, Jesus did that.
[time=2772] In the heat of the intensity in Luke 10 of sending out his disciples to do it, he helped them.
[time=2777] And the impurities rose to the top, and that leads us to transforming our correction.
[time=2781] Now, correction is what each one of you thought of in your mind when you thought about the word discipline.
[time=2786] Until you heard disciple, then you kind of got a little bit off that.
[time=2789] And so I just want to start out by saying, you do, I watch. Look at this.
[time=2793] Three to one formative to reformative.
[time=2798] Three to one, the first three form you.
[time=2801] It's only the last one that reforms you, the correcting.
[time=2805] Kids would take it a lot better if correcting was all done after teaching, training, and testing.
[time=2812] It's just a natural part of it.
[time=2814] How many of us may be teach, and then we jump right to correction, and jump right to correction, and jump right to correction.
[time=2822] And we don't just do it with our kids. We do it in churches.
[time=2825] We do it with our businesses and people we're leading.
[time=2827] We say something, then we correct. We say something, then we correct.
[time=2830] What about training and testing?
[time=2833] It's interesting.
[time=2835] Now, Proverbs 29, 19 talks about this, and it says it's not done just with words.
[time=2840] A servant cannot be corrected by mere words, though he understands he will not respond.
[time=2846] It takes action. There needs to be a behavior mechanism.
[time=2850] Something's going to adjust the behavior. Proverbs 13, 18.
[time=2854] Says, "He who ignores discipline comes to poverty and shame, but whoever he's correction is honored."
[time=2861] It's interesting. Proverbs 12, 1, says the stupid one hates correction.
[time=2866] And Proverbs 10, 17 says, "Ignoring it leads others astray." We see that on football fields, basketball courts, tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball fields, that the person who ignored discipline leads everybody else astray.
[time=2879] How are you going to do it? There's three ways. There's three ways.
[time=2883] Three ways to bring that behavior modification.
[time=2886] And the first one is positive reinforcement. It's what I did with the girls, positive reinforcement.
[time=2891] I gave them each grace. I gave them each the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
[time=2896] To reinforce their positive behavior.
[time=2899] Number two is negative reinforcement. I take something away to reinforce the behavior I wish I would have seen that they did not do.
[time=2908] I take something away for behavior that was not what we were looking for.
[time=2913] Number three is I punish. I punish. Now, punishment needs to be swift, fair, and appropriate.
[time=2919] The time needs to fit the crime. One thing I don't like is when we say,
[time=2925] "You can't go to youth group tonight because you didn't do such and such unless maybe it's homework."
[time=2931] We got to be careful what we're using to create the consequences.
[time=2935] They ought to be related so that they learn and feel what we wanted them to learn and feel.
[time=2940] Short-term consequences are much better than long-term crisis.
[time=2945] And this is done out of love. Teach, train, test, transform.
[time=2952] There's a recent survey, I don't know if you heard it this week, of several corporate CEOs.
[time=2958] 100% of the corporate CEOs surveyed were spanked as children.
[time=2964] Those who had discipline are those who are making disciples.
[time=2968] And that's exactly the way it's going to be.
[time=2971] Those who have discipline are those who will make disciples.
[time=2974] And it includes transforming or correcting the behavior, "You do I watch." Now, my mom and dad watch me do the things that they taught me.
[time=2984] Now, I'm watching Lily read this to me.
[time=2993] I guess my question for you is, because Jesus did this, Jesus brought the disciples back
[time=2999] after he sent them out and he said, "Okay, let's debrief a little bit.
[time=3002] What impurities rose to the top? Let's correct those." And then Jesus died, resurrected, ascended and left his disciples to do it.
[time=3010] Jesus' role in essence, his oversimplification, was to get himself out of a job and to live it through other people.
[time=3019] My question to you is, what are your kids? What are you watching your kids do?
[time=3025] What are you watching your kids do? What are you helping your kids do?
[time=3031] What are your kids helping you do? What are your kids watching you do?
[time=3036] You know, as I look through this and I see that Christ is the model, I look back on my mom and my dad
[time=3043] and their investment in me and I look at how I'm trying to pay that forward in my kids and in coaching and all that.
[time=3049] And I look at the model of Christ, be a disciple of Christ, his discipline in your life so that grace wins.
[time=3056] The steering wheel of grace, discipline is the steering wheel of grace.
[time=3060] And I realize that it wasn't my mom and dad.
[time=3064] It's not me and it's not you. It's Christ in us.
[time=3071] The capitalist spirit of Christ in us. That's the discipline. That's the discipleship.
[time=3076] It's Christ in me.
[time=3079] And in Hebrews 12, 1 through 6, it kind of sums us all up.
[time=3083] It talks about fixing your eyes on Christ and that's what I ask you to do, to fix your eyes on Him, to know Him,
[time=3089] to have a model of His behavior, to read the Bible for yourselves.
[time=3095] I got my oldest two now reading chapter a day and it's hit and miss, but this is now the beginning of a lifelong thing.
[time=3103] I want them to read a chapter a day in Proverbs corresponding with the date of the month.
[time=3107] And I want them to close their days. I want them to open their day that way.
[time=3110] I want them to close it with one chapter in the New Testament so every year for the rest of their lives they will read through the New Testament and Proverbs, 12 times in Proverbs.
[time=3121] And then I'm going to ask them to come to the graduate level and to read three chapters a day in the old
[time=3127] so that every year for the rest of their lives they will experience what has transformed my life more than any one thing.
[time=3136] And the writer of Hebrews says, "Fix your eyes on Christ. It's His Spirit.
[time=3139] A runner would have to fix his eyes on a marker." And he's saying, "Let your marker be Christ and throw off the sin that entangles us." The picture is these weights of sin and pride that would have been in the fabric woven in the fabric of their jerseys
[time=3154] that they would have trained with and they take those off so now they can run faster. Go on to verse 3.
[time=3161] Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[time=3168] In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood but Christ did.
[time=3173] And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons and this is where it comes around full circle literally.
[time=3180] My son do not make light of the Lord's discipline and do not lose heart when he rebukes you because the Lord disciplines those He loves and He punishes everyone He accepts as a son.
[time=3192] Discipline is the steering wheel of grace.
[time=3197] I've asked Steph to come up and I want to ask you to do one more thing.
[time=3201] And that is to use the Bible humbly.
[time=3204] Humbly. What I mean by that is you don't lord it over your kids.
[time=3208] You don't say, "Proverbs 3, 11 and 12 says you idiot." And you don't do that.
[time=3212] You have this going on in your own life and so you say, "You know, I was reading Proverbs today." And I read in chapter 3 this and this is how I'm going to try to apply it to my life.
[time=3223] Why don't we try to do that together?
[time=3226] And there's a humility. And what's amazing to me here is it's not -- now listen to this.
[time=3232] It's not us, it's Christ in us, but we embrace Christ as teacher.
[time=3236] We embrace Christ as trainer.
[time=3240] We embrace Christ as transformer and we make disciples of Christ in our kids.
[time=3248] So listen to these words.
[time=3249] I'd like you to bow your heads and to hold the palms of your hands up on your knees.
[time=3254] And I'd like you just as Steph sings to invite Christ to show you where you might be missing the mark.
[time=3260] Where you might be twisting wrongs to make them right.
[time=3263] Where you might be just flat out breaking God's law.
[time=3267] Where you might be leaving good undone.
[time=3269] And would you commit the day to allow Christ in you to teach, to train, to test and transform.
[time=3276] You, your kids, your coworkers, your entire circle of influence.
[time=3281] So close your eyes, bow your head, palms up on your knees.
[time=3284] And just ask the spirit of Christ to move on you today.
[time=3289] Oh soul, are you weary and troubled?
[time=3300] No light in the darkness we see.
[time=3309] There's light for a look at the Savior.
[time=3318] And life more abundant every year.
[time=3327] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=3335] Look full in His render full face.
[time=3343] And the things of earth will grow strangely dead.
[time=3352] In the light of His glory and grace.
[time=3360] Through death into life everlasting.
[time=3368] He passed and we follow Him there.
[time=3383] For more than conquers and we are.
[time=3391] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=3398] Look full in His render full face.
[time=3406] And the things of earth will grow strangely dead.
[time=3414] In the light of His glory and grace.
[time=3422] His word shall not fail you, He promised.
[time=3430] Believe Him and all will be well.
[time=3437] Then go to a world that is dying.
[time=3444] His perfect salvation to death.
[time=3452] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=3460] Look full in His render full face.
[time=3467] And the things of earth will grow strangely dead.
[time=3475] In the light of His glory and grace.
[time=3497] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
