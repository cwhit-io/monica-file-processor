[time=935] >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> I'm just going to kind of let you in in a window of my soul on what happened this morning as I pondered again this question about whether
[time=952] God is generous. He took me back to the beginning in the beginning God created and he took me to day one and
[time=959] God said there was light There was light and it says It was good Good is a derivative of God. Good is a derivative of God and God is a generous God. I Thought about day two When God created the expanse in the sky and every day is an opportunity to see that sky and to see those waters and to see
[time=987] This reflection of this umbrella of God. God is my banner This banner over me is love and that Every day I have an opportunity to kind of just relish that I have an opportunity to to see that say is God generous. Well on day two
[time=1001] God said it's good good as a derivative of God and God is a generous God then I thought about day three this morning with God and
[time=1010] day three when he created the land kind of separated from the waters and brought living vegetation up from the ground and
[time=1018] I have an opportunity every day when I eat fruit or eat vegetables or see other people doing so or walk into a facility
[time=1025] That was provided for shelter from the trees that God provided. I have an opportunity to see God as a generous God
[time=1032] The question is do I?
[time=1034] Well, God looked at all that and said it's good good as a derivative of God and God is a generous God
[time=1040] In that time alone with God, I thought about day four And how God created the stars The moon and the sun three days after he created light interestingly
[time=1053] And that every time I go out at night Every time that you and I have a moon is a backdrop on a romantic evening with our spouses
[time=1065] Anytime I see the sun and feel its warmth and I have an opportunity to see all of that
[time=1077] As a generous God Because God looked at that and God said it's good And good is a derivative of God and God is a generous God Out of his generosity. He creates I thought about day five When God created the birds and the fish When I think about the times I've had to encounter God alone
[time=1099] How oftentimes one of those two have had something to do with that, you know, you'll be alone with God
[time=1105] I remember being in Canada alone with God and seeing an eagle fly and land on a tree near me I remember that for the trip was a fishing trip and it's and many times It's just been those opportunities that I I just get to think about God and and nothing else And maybe when you see a cardinal just land on a branch or a hummingbird kind of floating in the air You know, you and I have an opportunity to think about God Is a generous God because God looked at all that and said it's good and good as a derivative of God and God
[time=1135] As a generous God Then I thought about day six And God created the livestock, but then God did something rather unique And the second account of creation in Genesis 2 verse 7. It says that God picked up the dust
[time=1150] And he breathed in it and he created man in his own image
[time=1162] There's a Hebrew scholar on the west coast who has rewritten his translation of the first five books of the Bible and he says we've missed something there in our
[time=1172] Translations that are common. He said God didn't just breathe and walk away He says actually the Hebrew describes a continual present tense of the inhaling and exhaling of God that every breath I take
[time=1183] Is actually a breath of God Well
[time=1192] God looked at that and he said something different He says you know what that's very good Good as a derivative of God and God as a generous God, but God created you and he created me to be the very
[time=1207] expression of his generosity to every single person we lock eyes with We tend to lump all of these things into three baskets of the resources of life
[time=1222] And they're time talent and treasures. I want to ask you today. Do you see God is generous with time? I
[time=1228] Mean if you're in Christ you have eternity, so I don't think it could give you much more Do you see God is generous with talent with the unique expression of him that he's breathed into you and continually
[time=1242] Sustains with every breath because not one single person here rows his hand and say hey God create me and make me like this
[time=1250] No, God did that and there's a unique expression of God and each one of us that he designed
[time=1256] God is a generous God And our treasures now that's gets where it's really gets easy
[time=1265] To see God has may be stingy and not generous Because we'll say oh man God you gave a lot to that guy over there and compared to him
[time=1275] You know I don't have much and we kind of go on and on and on with that Well, you know Jesus address this was kind of a different circumstance Did some Jews were having a tough time with Gentiles being late commerce to the party and being able to receive salvation
[time=1290] In the benefits of that and Jesus told a story of the workers in the vineyard and he ended it with are you envious
[time=1297] Because I'm generous You see whatever we have Was a gift from God and we have an opportunity we have an opportunity either see God as generous or kind of stingy and
[time=1314] My perspective of God determines how I prioritize my life. Do you today see God as generous?
[time=1322] I think David did I think he did too. Why don't you open your Bibles to first chronicles 29?
[time=1329] first chronicles Just after kings Find your way there to first chronicles the 29th chapter Katie, I think I'll go on to 14 15 and 16 I don't know if you can get it up there by then but let me just Let me invite all of you to stand if you would and in honor of God's word We'll stand together and I want you to think about this idea that Mitchell has introduced the generosity of God
[time=1355] Do you serve do you know a generous God is our God generous?
[time=1361] First chronicles 29. I'm going to start in verse 10 It says so David blessed the Lord and the side of their giving an offering here the context is there
[time=1371] They're bringing offerings for the temple and David in verse 10 It says so David blessed the Lord in the sight of all the assembly and David said blessed are you oh Lord God of Israel?
[time=1381] Our Father forever and ever Yours oh God is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty indeed
[time=1391] Everything that is in the heavens and on the earth yours is the dominion oh Lord, and you exalt yourself as head overall
[time=1398] Both riches and honor come from you read that again both riches and honor
[time=1405] come from you and you rule overall and In your hand is power and might and in it lies in your hand to make great and to strengthen everyone now
[time=1418] therefore our God we thank you and Praise your glorious name verse 14 says but who am I and?
[time=1426] Who are my people that we should be able to offer as generously as this for all things come from you and From your hand we have given you verse 15 for we are so journers
[time=1441] before you and tenants as all our fathers were our days on the earth are like a shadow and
[time=1449] There is no hope our Lord our God all this abundance that we have provided to build you a house
[time=1457] For your holy name. It is from your hand and all is what?
[time=1464] yours Pray with me, would you father? God we stand humbly before you this morning and we are reminded of your greatness and your majesty
[time=1474] your might God and your power and Your generosity In showering all of that on us God bringing to us the blessings of life providing for us in the ways that you have God
[time=1490] bringing material and physical possessions, but also God bringing the spiritual strength and truth and spirit and light that we need God you have provided everything and
[time=1504] May we this morning begin to in a very serious in a very Important way God may we view you and see you as the generous God that you are and may your generosity God
[time=1518] Spark a response in us Father, I believe it's time Maybe long overdue For you to see in me and I believe maybe in the lives of those in this room a response a
[time=1533] True and unadulterated response God to your generosity that you have bestowed on us
[time=1541] May we as we take in this truth as we think through these principles God may we be a generous people and
[time=1548] Your son's name we pray amen you may be seated
[time=1556] God is generous. I like you to write this down if you could God is generous There's a need Will I respond with generosity or greed?
[time=1567] God is generous There's a need Will I respond with Generosity or greed First idea we talked about is that God is generous the second thing we want to talk about is there's a need Because in Genesis 3 sin entered the world and we now have a sin against God and a sin against others
[time=1594] We have this need for God's Generosity and God's ideas at this generosity would flow to others who need God's generosity and so when that doesn't happen I
[time=1607] Kind of stop the flow of that and there's this need that I have because of my sin against God and then I have a sin against others by not
[time=1615] Releasing that generosity that God is designed to do through me I want to talk just quickly about the sin against God and review what we did last week Last week I brought my girls up here and shared the four predominant ways that
[time=1632] the New Testament describes that we sin and using the Greek words for that and Just a quick review of that is is the first one was Megan came up here and she tried to make the shot and she missed it
[time=1643] And that's the first way that we sin. It's missing the mark. It's falling short. This is the most frequent
[time=1649] Word used throughout the Bible for sin. Hi sin against God by falling short
[time=1655] I tried to get it right, but I didn't quite make it Megan shot it tried to make it and she missed
[time=1661] Second way I brought Kelsey up and she Came up and shot the ball and missed it, but she told us all that she made it She twisted a wrong in an attempt to make it right We do that a lot, you know, we justify our sin We justify a wrong usually the farther we go down that road the more we're working this one it and we get caught in that
[time=1683] We twist the wrong to make it right I brought Lily up and Lily creatively showed us how you miss on purpose You actually walk up to the line and don't even try to make it in fact. It's lawlessness is breaking the law saying
[time=1699] There's no law. It's just saying you know what I'm gonna do this anyway and In our anger. It's not God's design, but in our anger. We have a tendency to do that. Sometimes. I'm just gonna break the law
[time=1712] missing on purpose and then we brought Haley up little Haley three years old by Sunday and she just held the ball and
[time=1721] She didn't shoot at all. She Found herself leaving good undone The last verse in James 4 I think it's James 4 17 says that anyone who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it
[time=1737] sins So we do that we have a sin against God. We have a need from God for his generosity because We miss the mark we twist wrongs to make him right. We Miss on purpose. We leave good undone But the good news was that in the usages of those words all throughout the New Testament for each one
[time=1759] There was a usage of a form of grace or forgiveness grace undeserved love
[time=1767] unmerited favor the generosity of God in Christ second Corinthians eight nine And Kelly's gonna talk a little more about this has become one of my favorite verses and it says that you know
[time=1780] God's generosity God's grace is this that Christ was rich But for our sakes he became poor
[time=1792] So that we might become rich, but today we're gonna talk about why It's an amazing picture that Mitchell just painted Amazing in that what he paints for us there is this picture that many of us in the room have seen before
[time=1807] I've stood on this stage before with a big white easel and taken out the big black pen and I've drawn This picture of the bridge this the spiritual reality this amazing story that I hope never ever ceases to be amazing for you
[time=1820] That we are there's this sin against God as Mitchell Just said that whatever form one two three or four whichever of those sins the fact of the matter is Romans three says for all have what?
[time=1830] Send and fallen short of a glory of God. So there's this huge problem There is you and I in our humanness over here in our sinfulness Roman six says the wages of that sin the result what we get what we deserve what we earn wages of that sin is death
[time=1850] Separation from God. So here we are in our humanness. God's over on the other side of the chasm
[time=1856] He's over here on the other side of the canyon He's over here on the other side of this gap that you nor I could have ever bridged and in his great love in mercy
[time=1865] I love how it says it in Ephesians 2 verse 4, but God being rich in mercy
[time=1871] Because of his great love with which he loved us even when we were dead
[time=1878] Even when we were dead in our transgressions made us alive together with Christ by grace
[time=1885] We have been saved he bridges this gap with the offering of his son Who comes and lives and dies and defeats death so that you and I can have life and See I believe the scriptures teach it and I think most of you in this room who have experienced that redemptive love
[time=1904] We understand there's a response then when you and I the recipients of that grace and that salvation
[time=1910] When we're redeemed then there wells up on us this response and we want to give it back to God And that looks like worship and that looks like praise and that that looks like service and that looks like honor
[time=1922] And there's there's all these responses that flow out of us toward him And and one of those would probably need to be and and I see it in many of you
[time=1932] And I hope you see that times in me a generosity toward him a generosity toward him For God so loved the world John 3 16, right?
[time=1943] And I want to go on this morning to 17 and 18 look at the screens for God so loved the world that he gave his only
[time=1949] Forgotten son that whosoever believes in him. You see it there shall not what?
[time=1955] Shall not perish but have eternal life it goes on in verse 17 For God did not send the son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him
[time=1965] In verse 18 for he who believes in him is not judged He who does not believe has been judged already Because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God
[time=1979] And so there are there is in you and there is in me this response this response toward God for what he did there an
[time=1988] amazing gift But here's what I want you to think about this morning Here's what we want you to give some thought to our response even our generous response toward God for what he has done
[time=1999] It cannot end with him That is an appropriate response that you and I would be generous toward him and thankful toward him But all through the scriptures we see again and again that this is not just a it's not just a vertical response
[time=2013] There is a need and an opportunity for you and I to to respond generously to with that love that Mitchell talked about earlier
[time=2020] With that love and grace that we've been given there is the opportunity to live generously with others
[time=2026] And sometimes we don't sometimes we don't do that one very well
[time=2032] You know you're making me think that about this idea that Do I see I think we got to ask ourselves this question. Do we see?
[time=2043] God as generous in Light of the sin thing because I think in our fallenness. We have a real tendency to minimize it and See, you know, it's just all God's business and whatever he's got going on there and we don't personalize it own it
[time=2061] Confess it repent from it and all of that really flows from a humble heart
[time=2067] That receives God's generosity It's almost like the the best way to be generous is To receive the generosity of God In a really cool verse that kind of describes that is Psalm 116. It's actually two verses first 12 and 13
[time=2085] I really like it. It says how can I repay the Lord for all his goodness to me?
[time=2093] I'll just lift up the cup of salvation and I'll take it the King James says I'll call on the name of the Lord
[time=2099] I'll invite him in And I want you to ask yourself today. Are you doing that?
[time=2104] Are you connecting in all of your heart?
[time=2109] With this receiving of the generosity of the living God of the universe in Christ who was
[time=2117] rich But for our sakes he became poor So that we might become rich And if we tend to hold on to that and ignore others then we have a sin
[time=2132] Against others so we have a sin against God and we have a sin against others Jane go ahead. Why not and I know it shouldn't be this way and I'm not sure, you know
[time=2142] Literally that we can do this but I mean, but I think we do I think we're actually very thankful
[time=2148] And I'll speak for me, you know, if the shoe fits put it on But I just think there are times when we are very very thankful for his generosity toward us
[time=2158] And we're not very generous Toward others And again, I don't believe it should be that way I think truly it can't be but you know, we've kind of made it that way at times We I think as a church if you were to ask me what what concerns me in the in the church today
[time=2179] What I see that concerns me in our family what I see that concerns me and me I Think there is a tendency to be very very grateful Genuinely thankful for what he's done for me and absolutely unwilling at times to extend generosity toward others in real meaningful and tangible ways and in doing so we sin
[time=2202] Against others keep going the problem occurs When my life becomes characterized and known by what you just described Yes, and so let's look what James says James writes in chapter 2 verses 14 through 17 If you want to jot down the reference James to 14 through 17 What good is it my brothers if a man claims?
[time=2219] to have faith But has no deeds Can't such a faith actually save him?
[time=2230] Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food Just suppose that and if one of you says to him go. I wish you well keep warm and well fed
[time=2240] But does nothing about his physical needs What good is that?
[time=2249] in the same way Faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is
[time=2258] dead it doesn't exist If I have received the generosity of Christ the generosity of God in Christ then Christ dwells in me and
[time=2271] Therefore that generosity of God in Christ is going to come out in my behavior
[time=2277] but when I walk by Somebody who fits in my agenda and somebody who doesn't an agenda adjuster and
[time=2287] I think to myself Keep warm and well fed But I do nothing to meet the physical need I Have now just missed the mark quite possibly twisted a wrong to make it right quite possibly broke the law and
[time=2305] Definitely left good undone. I've done all four And that's a sobering thought Proverbs 14 31 because I encounter it every month. There's been one that I've been wrestling with and this is this is interesting
[time=2320] What do you mean you encounter it every month? I read through Proverbs the chapter of the day to go with the day of the month
[time=2327] He who oppresses the poor Shows contempt For their maker But whoever is kind to the needy Honors God NESB Kelly pointed out says it a different way. I think it's going to come out of the screen. He who oppresses the poor taunts
[time=2351] It's a strong word Taunts his maker, but he who is gracious to the needy honors him It's just so interesting how The sin against God is inseparable From the sin against others in need. I mean they go together
[time=2372] and generosity might seem so nebulous and what is that and we're going to try to touch upon that in the next couple weeks, but
[time=2380] There is a need And Kelly's got a stat sheet on some of that. It's very interesting Yeah, I just want to share with you a few things There's a lot more that we could have Written down here and maybe we'll share it with you in the days to come But I just these are the kinds of learnings these are the kinds of things that I feel like God is Impressing upon my own heart. These are things. I'm coming to realize and having to wrestle with in my life
[time=2409] For the first time at least I think at the first time At a significant level and I'm beginning to ask myself questions about my response and my willingness
[time=2419] The generosity that does or does not flow out of me toward others. I Consider myself really grateful For what God has done in me. I think most of you who know me would say that to be true I'm really really thankful, but when I begin to realize Really how blessed I am and how much I possess
[time=2442] And how able I am to pass that on to others when I really start to wrestle with that
[time=2450] Which is what some of these?
[time=2452] truths and statistics are about it really really has been interesting you may know this you may not
[time=2459] 800 million people in the world today will not eat 800 million people will not eat today Raise your hand if you've eaten today All right, 800 million people will not have a crumb
[time=2486] Pass through their mouth of the eight hundred million three hundred and fifty million of them are under the age of what
[time=2499] Now just don't read that too fast
[time=2505] Don't look at me. Look at that. Go ahead and just make yourself look at that For just a moment here Every three seconds a child dies of hunger
[time=2519] 24,000 a day Look at the screen 24,000 children will die Today because they don't have any food Experts agree that 20 billion dollars if somebody would just write a 20 billion dollar check
[time=2546] That it would solve almost all of the world's water health and nutrition needs
[time=2552] Last year in the world people spent 25 billion on ice cream
[time=2562] This is not conjecture. These are this is real data And this is just meant to give you an eye a moment of pause Not trying to make your kids feel bad about a pop cycle I'm trying to help you and I give some thought to what we have
[time=2587] A billion people in the world today have no clean drinkable water
[time=2593] They can't drink Water they got no water. They drink the water. They die a billion people Anybody had a drink of water today raise their hand Six percent of the world
[time=2609] Raise your hand if you drove a car here this morning raise your hand if you drove a car here this morning six percent of the world
[time=2616] Drive their own cars 94% of The world don't if you got a car Least in a car you own a car you're driving a car any car if it starts You're you're rich You got change in your pocket right now change in a dish somewhere any money in the bank top 5% of
[time=2640] the world's wealthiest people You and I we're coming out in Forbes magazine next month top 5% wealthiest in the world you and me We are 1.3 billion people make less than a dollar a day
[time=2662] Raise your hands if you're in the room and you make more than a buck a day
[time=2669] 1.3 billion people make less than a dollar a day And I could just keep going but here's the point. So it's clearly not about Is it it's clearly not about?
[time=2681] The haves and the have-nots it's clearly not about the guy across the aisle who obviously God blessed more than you is
[time=2689] It I Mean it's clearly not about You and I Being in trouble or you and I not having enough or you and I not being able to do anything
[time=2704] It's clearly not about that. It is clearly about the priorities we establish and the directions within which we choose to allocate our resources I Was just gonna say and we're gonna respond yeah one way or the other exactly the third idea we're gonna respond with
[time=2727] generosity or greed and Before and before we jump into that I just I just want to say this to you He's right, and I don't think there's a C. I think it's an a or b you agree. Yeah, I think we mask
[time=2740] Greed in being thrifty. Yes You will respond we will respond to all of that We will respond to the generosity of God one way or the other we will be generous or We will be greedy And the and the point I just wanted to make real quick is that the more I think this through and the more I read this
[time=2765] about these issues and The more I see others in our world respond. I Believe my friends. I believe that I've gotten a way off track on
[time=2778] This one. I believe the church in general has drifted I believe that if you and I are really interested in a look at what this says about the way Jesus
[time=2790] Lived about the way Jesus taught about the way he approached life
[time=2796] If we're really interested in looking at this and deriving from it a clear accurate picture of following Christ
[time=2804] Discipleship and its truest form for you and for me if you're really interested in
[time=2813] Looking at that. I believe it as you look. I believe it as we look. I believe that as we study that We see generosity again and again and again and again and again and again and I Just think it's really really important that you and I give some thought to this as we continue to spend some time Thinking these things through we will respond generosity or greed one of the other Jesus coming from a guy a generous
[time=2841] he lived generosity in the ultimate picture we have of that coming to earth as the poorest of the poor, right and
[time=2848] Living life homeless the last three years of his life. Yeah at least so
[time=2854] Generosity agreed if you want a working Jeff definition generosity would be trusting in the giver
[time=2860] Greed would be trusting in the gifts class was three five calls of idolatry generosity is trusting in the giver down
[time=2868] Greed is trusting in the gifts. Here's a response to generosity God through Moses makes it really clear in Deuteronomy 15 Amazing passage starts with verse 7. We'll go through 11 If there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the land that the Lord your God is giving you Do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted towards your poor brother hard heart and a tight fist goes together
[time=2892] Everybody just go ahead and raise your hand up and and make a tight fist and keep it there for a while He says rather just keep that up there while I talk. Okay, rather be open-handed and freely lend him whatever he needs
[time=2903] Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought the seventh year. Oh that year where they cancel everything all those debts
[time=2910] That's near So that you do not show ill will towards your needy brother and give him nothing He may then appeal to the Lord against you and you will be found guilty of sin
[time=2922] With that tight fist give generously to him and do so without a grudging or a hard heart
[time=2928] Then because of this the Lord your God will bless you Because of this Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to so get rid of the hard heart and
[time=2946] Have a soft heart one that receives generosity from God and open your hand. Let's quit white knuckling
[time=2952] Hargy laterno said God shovels it in time-talent treasures. I shovel it out God has a bigger shovel than I do he made shovels You can put your hands down Paul told Timothy it works this way for Timothy 6 7th 17th or 19. Yeah for Timothy 6 17 through 19 Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant hard-hearted nor to put their hope in wealth
[time=2985] Don't trust in the gifts, which is so uncertain but to put their hope trust in the giver God
[time=2993] Who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment?
[time=2999] Gifts aren't bad. It's Trusting in the gifts. It's bad time out real quick. Don't forget seekers. We're so conditioned go back a slide Katie
[time=3009] Just real quick. Don't forget verse 17 command those who are rich Okay based upon the stats Who's he talking to?
[time=3019] Say it loud Yeah, okay. I just didn't want you transferring that passage to somebody sitting across the way Just want to make sure from now on when you see the phrase rich and Wealthy that we're all on the same page. You got change in your dish. You're in
[time=3037] All right, sorry, that's okay. That's great and then verse 18 Command them to do good To be rich in good deeds. This is why the generosity of God in Christ has come to us so that we'd be rich in good deeds
[time=3054] Generous and willing to share but trying to teach us to my kids and it doesn't matter
[time=3060] Any two have fallen in this category at one time or another
[time=3066] We sit down and we start eating the food and the French fries are there and there's an opportunity
[time=3072] to be generous with the French fries and so the question is are you going to be generous with the French fries while they are hot and
[time=3080] Crispy as God intended them to be or are you gonna share the French fries when you're at the bottom and they're cold and
[time=3087] Soggy and only after you are satisfied and I watch that I watch that the girls at some point in their lives one time or another
[time=3095] We'll want to share the soggy cold French fries only after they're satisfied
[time=3101] And here's what I tell them when I see it. I Am your provider of French fries and when I see
[time=3110] Sharing up the hot crispy French fries Then I want to go to that counter to the 99 cent menu and buy more
[time=3120] when I see Sharing of scold soggy Bottom of the box after I'm satisfied French fries. I Don't ever want to go to the 99 cent menu again. I Think God is telling us quit sharing The bottom of the box cold soggy French fries And you know we prayed about this
[time=3154] Before we came out it just kind of came out, you know As I was praying it just kind of came to me again that what Kelly said earlier what Jesus did with his life
[time=3166] He seemed to meet a physical need every single time before he met a spiritual one
[time=3179] I think that's the pattern of generosity and it and it says in I Think this is right Ephesians 210 it says we are here the whole reason
[time=3190] Well, you know one of the great reasons he redeemed us. It says there. It says we are his workmanship
[time=3196] Created in Christ for what good works good works for good deeds these generous
[time=3203] Offerings to others Will respond my friends you and I will respond there will be a generous response or there will be a greedy
[time=3211] Response and let me just remind you of gree greed is trusting in the gifts Instead of the giver and again God's word speaks to this He warns his people back in Deuteronomy Katie if you could go to Deuteronomy six ten Deuteronomy six ten to thirteen. I want to just show you turning your Bibles there Deuteronomy six this comes
[time=3234] right after that classic passage where he talks about Hiding God's word in their hearts and talking to their children about it when they when they sit down and when they rise up and when they're
[time=3245] Along the way and binding these words and these commands on their Foreheads and hanging them on there I mean there was just the sense of keeping the truth before them all the time and then in verse 10 of Deuteronomy six
[time=3258] It says then watch this here comes the warning then it shall come about When the Lord your God brings you into the land which he swore to your father's Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give to you
[time=3269] Great and splendid cities which you did not build and houses full of all good things
[time=3275] Which you did not fill and hewn cisterns wells which you did not dig vineyards and olive trees
[time=3283] Which you did not plant and you eat and are satisfied then watch be careful then watch yourself
[time=3291] Here comes greed That you do not forget we sang this morning about remembering That you do not forget the Lord who brought you from the land of Egypt out of the house of
[time=3304] slavery You know if you go over to Deuteronomy eight verse 17 Deuteronomy 8 17 says otherwise you may say in your heart my power and my strength the strength of my hand made me this wealth
[time=3321] But you shall remember the Lord your God for it is he who is giving you power to make wealth Time out who's wealthy?
[time=3329] Say it There you go He gave you power to make wealth that he may confirm his covenant which he swore to your father's as it is this day
[time=3342] God is generous Do you agree with that this morning say amen?
[time=3350] And you know what my friends? There's a need do you agree with that?
[time=3354] There's a need and you and I Will be marked by we will be characterized by you and I will respond one way or the other and as we think about our time and
[time=3367] Our talents and as we think about our our treasures as we think about our time in talent and treasure
[time=3374] We think about this place and this ministry that God has given us inside and outside these four walls
[time=3380] When you think about the local church and the opportunity for people to be for you and I to be a gracious people in
[time=3386] the way that we give These are things that we need to give some thought to these are the truths that you and I need to consider
[time=3394] And I want to we want to invite you to come back next week a lot of times when we start talking about generosity and giving and time and
[time=3401] Talent and treasure a lot of times. There's misconceptions We want to address several of those a lot of times there are questions about what that can look like and how that should be done
[time=3411] And we want to address those as well We want you to leave today asking this though One question leave today asking this is there any room in me?
[time=3421] Is there room in me for greater levels of Generosity and my time my talent
[time=3431] And my treasure and we'll come back and continue the discussion next week. Would you stand with us Mitchell? Would you pray?
[time=3437] God you are a generous God and there's a need
[time=3446] God help us to respond with generosity not green I'm reminded of the guy I bumped into kind of a white collar guy in need and it was so easy to give him a little time
[time=3459] It was so easy to give a little talent, but then kind of the yellow flags come up on whether or not he's going to be given any treasures
[time=3466] God help us with all of our hearts To receive your generosity your grace in Christ and then with all of our hearts and all of our resources of life
[time=3478] to not be hard-hearted and tight-fisted but to be soft-hearted and open-handed Prompt us God in our lives this week as an experience with you Where there are opportunities?
[time=3495] For greater levels of Generosity might be with a spouse with a family member with a friend or it might be an agenda adjuster
[time=3503] but God Through the spirit of you in us. May we know in Jesus name amen
