[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=61] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
[time=67] Therefore go and make disciples of all nature,
[time=76] baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=88] Peaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=95] Helping seekers, find and follow Christ.
[time=102] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk
[time=115] Ministries, and it's good to be with you again.
[time=117] We're so thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=119] We want to today do what we've done in the past.
[time=122] And that is something that it's something we've really enjoyed doing.
[time=125] And that is sharing with you, those of you in our viewing audience, some of the great, great things that God is doing in and through the church of Fort Wayne.
[time=134] As I've told you before, one of my greatest joys, personally, and one of our greatest joys here at Black Hawk is to be literally-- and I mean this-- in partnership with a lot of churches filled with a lot of great people who, collectively, together, we have this one consuming passion, and that is to see people of all races, of all socio-economic backgrounds,
[time=159] blue collar, white collar, young people, old people.
[time=162] We want to see the church of Fort Wayne.
[time=164] We want to see people come to faith in Christ.
[time=167] And I'm so thankful that there are so many good, solid churches that lift up the truth of God's Word and have a great love for the community that God has placed them in.
[time=177] And I want to introduce you today to another friend of mine, a man who I respect immensely and admire greatly.
[time=185] And I want you to meet him.
[time=186] And I want you to hear about his church.
[time=188] And that friend is my brother, Luther Whitfield.
[time=192] And good to have you here, my friend.
[time=194] Well, it's good to be here with you.
[time=195] Yeah, great to be together.
[time=197] And I've known Luther for probably, well, for ever since I came to Fort Wayne, I would see Luther at golf outings.
[time=205] Luther, not that he's a great golfer, but he's been involved with youth for Christ for how many years?
[time=211] Going on 18 years now.
[time=213] 18 years in youth for Christ, serving in a number of different capacities.
[time=217] Started out as a juvenile justice worker, working with kids and institutions, then moved on and started doing campus life at Harding High School.
[time=228] And then the Lord just really excelled at ministry.
[time=232] And we started a urban center that has now grown to be the largest urban center in the youth for Christ in the US.
[time=242] So it's been tremendously-- That's the prime time.
[time=244] That's the prime time center.
[time=246] Worked with 45 kids the beginning.
[time=248] And now we're working with over 1,000 every week.
[time=250] My goodness.
[time=251] That's awesome.
[time=252] His Luther's involvement in youth for Christ over the years led to a time-- several years ago-- how many years ago did New Covenant begin to take shape?
[time=262] We're in our-- almost in our third year.
[time=264] We'll celebrate our third year on Father's Day.
[time=267] And so we've been in existence for two years.
[time=270] And it's just been amazing to watch what God has done.
[time=274] So he went from youth for Christ.
[time=276] And there's still some involvement there.
[time=278] But then, like Luther said, it was a few years ago that God really began to stir in his heart and in the hearts of many others, that he was in partnership with.
[time=287] The thought of starting a church.
[time=289] They're at that same location-- Absolutely.
[time=291] --where prime time is downtown.
[time=293] And it has just been an amazing thing to watch what God has done as he has worked through Luther and his team and that family.
[time=301] The church is called New Covenant Worship Center.
[time=304] That's correct.
[time=304] And I want to just give Luther an opportunity to tell you about the church and its ministry more than anything.
[time=312] I just want him to have a chance to share with you the heart of that place.
[time=317] What they are about, what they feel like God has uniquely called them to do.
[time=322] I know there's many of you out there that will enjoy hearing the story of that church and what's on Luther's heart.
[time=328] So Luther, just share with the folks what God's doing there through New Covenant.
[time=332] Well, it started again two years ago.
[time=335] I can remember, Kelly, we were-- I was attending a conference in Kansas City speaking at a fatherless conference.
[time=342] And to be honest with you didn't quite know even why I was there.
[time=347] And it was there that they were sharing on the absentee father.
[time=352] And I can remember being in that conference and listening to a brother share his heart.
[time=356] When the Spirit of the Lord spoke to my heart and simply said, you're kind of like him.
[time=361] And honestly, I thought I had tuned in on somebody else's prayer, at least I was open.
[time=367] But the fact of it that God was simply staring with me is that we have reached so many kids for Christ.
[time=373] But none of them were conducting with a local church.
[time=376] And it literally broke my heart.
[time=378] I can't remember brothers, black brothers, white brothers coming around praying for me and just really just very emotional about that.
[time=386] And I remember coming back and getting with a dear good friend of mine, Mick Baker, who is the executive director for you for Christ and simply sharing with him that maybe my tenure was over and that I believe the Lord was calling me to start a work.
[time=399] And Mick just really began to say, Luther, how can we help?
[time=403] How can we be a part?
[time=405] Another good friend that I wanted to just share, prick his brains with was Rick Hawkes.
[time=412] And Rick, it's a good friend of mine.
[time=415] He's been for a long time like yourself.
[time=418] And Mick and myself got with Rick.
[time=420] And the first two hours, it was so funny, because the first two hours we spent crying together.
[time=425] And it was in that spinal hour that Rick and the chapel and said, hey, listen, what can we do to help get you going?
[time=433] And it was out of that time that the chapel helped launch.
[time=437] They gave a great financial gift to get us going.
[time=440] You for Christ was right there and said, hey, listen, we've got the primetime center, let's utilize that for the kingdom.
[time=446] And it really was a win-win for the kingdom of God.
[time=450] Since then, it's been amazing to watch.
[time=452] It's been a-- I knew for the longest that the Lord wanted us to, at least for me, to pastor a diverse church.
[time=459] Didn't know how he was going to do it, and didn't know he would use a gymnasium with a group of kids to draw that in.
[time=466] But now we have seen what the Lord's done.
[time=468] Our church is 60% black, 20% white, and the rest Hispanic and other cultures.
[time=476] And it's just been so rewarding on Sunday morning to come, and to, I believe, I get a taste of heaven on Sunday morning.
[time=484] I get to experience what I believe heaven is going to be like for us.
[time=489] We're very excited because, again, we want to be a church that reflects the kingdom of God.
[time=494] We want to be a church that is about people and ministering to God's people.
[time=500] In these past short years, we've given over 25,000 to benevolence, over 30,000 to missions.
[time=509] It has really been exciting to see what the Lord is doing.
[time=513] Our outreach ministry continues to be, I believe, the hallmark of our ministry with our labor of love, helping elderly, with some of their needs.
[time=523] Again, our outreach ministry to the Hispanic culture, with us in partnership with You for Christ and the chapel.
[time=530] We're running an ESL program for helping those individuals coming in to learn in English.
[time=537] Our outreach to young people every day of the week is tremendous, and then our children's ministry has just grown leaps and bounds.
[time=546] But I think, again, what we want to demonstrate is we want to demonstrate the love of Christ.
[time=552] We are currently in the process of our capital campaign for a new building, because we have maxed ourselves out of the primetime center.
[time=559] But it's not about brick and mortar with me.
[time=563] It's not about brick and mortar with our church and with our people.
[time=567] It really is about the people.
[time=569] Because, again, God's not coming back for a building.
[time=572] He's coming back for his people.
[time=574] And so, we really want to make the investment in people.
[time=578] And so, we are excited.
[time=580] We're excited that God is breaking down walls culturally.
[time=585] I'm excited that God is breaking down walls denominationally, and that it is about the kingdom.
[time=591] And I get to partner with great ministries, like Black Hawk, great ministries like the chapel, great ministries like You for Christ, and others that we get an opportunity to wrap our arms around and really see some things happen for the kingdom.
[time=606] And I think it's about time.
[time=607] We start doing that.
[time=609] [AMEN] Well, I'll tell you what, as I hear you talk about, and I wanted to just mention a couple of things.
[time=614] When I hear you talk about your capital campaign, share with the people.
[time=619] You've got some new property.
[time=621] Yes.
[time=622] Tell them where that is.
[time=623] Tell them a little bit about that.
[time=624] It's been exciting.
[time=626] We are located on Pauline and Hessen Castle, 26 acres of land that we've been able to purchase.
[time=633] And it really is exciting, because we really want to reach an area.
[time=639] There's a great housing.
[time=640] Ashley Claude's next there, that we really want to reach those kids in there.
[time=645] The success that we've had with our prime-time center, we want to duplicate that and take it to another area of the community that we can impact young people.
[time=655] We're excited because, again, there's a large Hispanic community over there that we want to touch for the kingdom.
[time=662] And so God has opened up a tremendous door for us to what I believe is just a great area to minister to people.
[time=671] And so we are looking forward that in the days ahead, if it's God's will, that we can break around.
[time=677] And if our campaign continues to be successful, that we can really do something significantly for the kingdom of God.
[time=684] That's awesome.
[time=685] I'm just sitting here thinking about Luther.
[time=688] And I'm thinking about just the little bit that I've been able to get to know him in recent years.
[time=694] And correct me if I'm wrong.
[time=696] But I sit here and I look at what God has you doing today.
[time=700] And I look back and I think, you know what?
[time=702] What a way that God had in preparing you for this.
[time=706] You talk about a diverse ministry.
[time=707] You went to Concordia.
[time=709] Is that right?
[time=710] That's right.
[time=711] You went to Concordia Lutheran High School.
[time=714] Where before then?
[time=716] I went to St. Paul's Lutheran.
[time=718] St. Paul's Lutheran.
[time=718] St. Mary's Catholic.
[time=721] So St. Mary's Catholic, St. Paul's Lutheran, Concordia.
[time=725] Youth for Christ, working with kids.
[time=727] That's correct.
[time=727] Urban settings, suburbia settings.
[time=730] You get where I'm going.
[time=732] It's just amazing to me.
[time=733] When I see where God has you today and I see the scope of your ministry, the people that you're reaching.
[time=738] And I look back on how God prepared you for that.
[time=741] To me, that's just an amazing, amazing thing.
[time=744] As we've been talking, you've all have been seeing on the screen.
[time=748] Phone number and service times.
[time=751] And I just want to encourage you.
[time=753] I really want to encourage you.
[time=755] You may be listening to Luther.
[time=757] You may as we've been talking.
[time=759] There just may be a sense in your heart where you'd like to go and check out this ministry and get to know Luther and his team.
[time=766] And we want to encourage you to do so.
[time=769] It is a phenomenal family.
[time=770] I've been there and I've seen and sensed their spirit and we would encourage you strongly to go and give that a look.
[time=778] You know what, God may be placing on your heart to help them with this new endeavor, Paul Ding and Hessen Castle.
[time=784] There may be some of you watching who have the means by which to support a ministry effort like that that is so vital for that part of town and for those dear people who need the ministry, that new covenant can bring to them.
[time=798] So you may want to think about that.
[time=800] Again, information is on the screen.
[time=802] We're so thankful that you've tuned in again and I'm so thankful for what God is doing in the church of Fort Wayne.
[time=807] Thank you, my friend.
[time=808] - Well, thank you.
[time=809] - Yep, good to be with you.
[time=811] And thank you again, folks, for tuning in.
[time=813] As always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=814] (upbeat music)
[time=832] [MUSIC - 67 seconds]
[time=903] - Talk about a group of people who were changed.
[time=913] Think about this, a group of people who were, who were blessed.
[time=919] I want you just to imagine in your mind a group of people, and it's not imagining.
[time=925] It's a real, it's a real life.
[time=928] They were really here.
[time=929] They really did what they did.
[time=931] There was a group of people who were changed and who were blessed, and they were in turn a blessing and they extended an invitation, and God did a miraculous thing with them.
[time=947] I write about it on the, you can read it on the front homepage of our website.
[time=951] There was a day when people would meet together.
[time=956] There really was.
[time=957] They'd meet together in the atmosphere of love and deep devotion.
[time=961] It was a day when people were welcomed unconditionally regardless of their race, social standing, or circumstance, a place where people served each other without question and sacrificed their time and their talent and treasure to honor their God and come alongside others.
[time=979] It was a day when a small but growing band of Christ followers declared their love and commitment to their God and even to those far from their God.
[time=987] The day was the first century and the place was Jerusalem.
[time=993] And the very first church found in the book of Acts, chapter two.
[time=998] Here at Black Hawk Ministries, our hope is to once again experience that kind of love and devotion, a deep and growing love for God and an authentic devotion to others.
[time=1009] Our prayer and our goal is to be a place and a people that model that same heart and spirit that made that first church so endearing to so many.
[time=1018] So whoever you are, red, yellow, black, brown, or white, rich, poor, or somewhere in between single, married single again with children or without.
[time=1026] Spiritually searching, no church background are fully surrendered.
[time=1030] We'd love to walk through and share life together.
[time=1033] Black Hawk's a church full of people wanting nothing more than to make much of God while sharing with you and those around the world, the grace and love they've received from knowing Him.
[time=1045] What a model for you and I, this very first church,
[time=1051] found right here in the pages of Acts.
[time=1053] I'll tell you what, the first time when I came to faith in September of 1983, and it wasn't, but probably six to 12 months down the road, somebody for the very first time opened up the pages of the book of Acts and kind of helped me see and began to teach me what it looked like and the values that they had embraced and the commitment that they possessed and the willingness that they had to in the everyday of their life be the church that God had called them to be.
[time=1081] And from the very first time I read it, from the very first time it got explained to me, from the very first time I studied what the early church was actually like, how they thought and how they functioned and what God did through that.
[time=1096] I was completely captivated and I remain captivated today.
[time=1102] I love the church.
[time=1105] I love is bright.
[time=1106] And when the people of God led by the spirit of God empowered by the word of God are willing to be the church, it is an incredible thing what God does.
[time=1117] Let me just read for you.
[time=1118] Can we just take a moment?
[time=1120] Can I just read for you from the book of Acts chapter two, turn in your Bibles and normally I'll have you stand this morning I'm actually gonna have you sit because I just want you to sit there and take this in.
[time=1130] I want every one of you young and old.
[time=1132] I want every one of you in this room to give some thought this morning to what this actually was like, what it actually looked like as these people came and gave themselves completely and fully to him and each other.
[time=1145] And I don't just want you to think about what it looked like for them.
[time=1147] I would love it if this morning you could by the grace of God and spirit of God just for a moment imagine what it would be like for you.
[time=1156] And for me to think and to function and to live with this kind of spirit.
[time=1161] You know I see it, I do.
[time=1163] I see glimpses of it at times in me.
[time=1165] I see this beginning to take shape in different settings and to varying degrees and I am so hopeful that you and I will be a people that will allow God to further reveal the fullness of all he designed us to be.
[time=1180] And I can't help but go back here to the beginning to just grab a picture, to just get a glimpse again of what that looked like.
[time=1186] Look at Acts 2.
[time=1188] I actually want to start in 41 because I want you to see what they were so given to and then I want you to see what being so given to that, what that produced in them.
[time=1197] Look at 41, it says in 241.
[time=1199] So then those who had received his word were baptized and that day there were added about 3,000 souls and they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[time=1218] They were continually devoting themselves, to the teaching of God's word and to fellowship the sharing of and experiencing life together.
[time=1229] There was communion taking place literally and figuratively and there was this commitment to prayer and everyone kept feeling a sense of awe, 43.
[time=1240] Verse 43 and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles, here you go, 44.
[time=1244] And all those who had believed were together and I want you to note something there where you see that phrase they were together, that phrase in the original language carries with it both the meaning of proximity.
[time=1257] They were together, yes, physically in a place but it also carries with it a relational component.
[time=1265] They were together, they all say to you this way, they were in this thing, what?
[time=1273] Together.
[time=1273] There was so much at stake.
[time=1278] The stakes were so high and God in his grace
[time=1284] had allowed them to be the recipients of this message and they were beginning to sense what he had in store and it brought them together.
[time=1295] You and me and they were also together in proximity
[time=1301] and all those who had believed were together and had all things in common.
[time=1307] Did they have all things in common?
[time=1310] I mean, did they have all things where they just alike, where they all wired the same, where did they all have the same personalities?
[time=1317] No.
[time=1320] But you know what, when it came to what, listen, when it came to what mattered, which is what this is addressing, we had all things in common.
[time=1327] This speaks to great unity and they began selling their property and possessions and we're sharing them with all as anyone might have need.
[time=1339] Day by day, continuing with how many minds?
[time=1342] With one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart.
[time=1351] This all collectively together leads them in verse 47 to praise God.
[time=1357] They were a people who praised God.
[time=1360] They were a people who spent time together.
[time=1362] They were a people who met physical needs wherever there was one.
[time=1366] And in all of that, as they continually gave themselves to the apostles teaching, as they constantly engaged in fellowship, as they spent time on their knees and faces in prayer, I love what it says in 47.
[time=1381] All of that leads to them having favor.
[time=1386] You see it there?
[time=1387] They had favor with all the people.
[time=1389] Favor with all the people does not refer to all the believers.
[time=1395] This is they had favor with all the people.
[time=1399] This kind of living, this kind of following, this kind of commitment, this kind of love, this kind of we're in this together.
[time=1410] Let's be faithful.
[time=1412] This kind of thought leads them to have favor with all the on looking world who sees them as they live out this faith.
[time=1420] With great conviction and with great passion they had favor with all the people.
[time=1425] And what does God do with that favor?
[time=1427] God uses that to bring, what does it say?
[time=1430] The Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
[time=1436] I love what it says in Acts 4.
[time=1440] Oftentimes we just look at Acts 2 when we want to grab that picture again of what it looked like in the early church, but look at Acts 4.
[time=1448] Acts 4, 32, and the congregation, the family of those who believed were of one heart, there you go, one heart and one soul.
[time=1457] And not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, better stop right there, just for a moment.
[time=1464] There was no sense of, that's mine.
[time=1472] It's mine.
[time=1476] There was no sense of get away, there was no sense of I worked hard for that, there was no sense of you don't deserve that I do, there was no sense of any spirit of hoarding or accumulating, there was, look what it says.
[time=1493] Not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them.
[time=1503] And with great power, the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, proclaiming the truth and abundant grace was upon them all.
[time=1513] Oh, here you go, verse 34, for there will think about this, there was not a needy person among them.
[time=1518] Go ahead and just stop right there for a moment and just wrap the arms of your heart and mind around that.
[time=1528] That there was not a needy person among them because they were that gracious, they were that devoted, they were that loving, they held things that loosely, they were so big picture, it was so eternal, it was not temporal and there wasn't a needy person among them.
[time=1550] For all who were owners of land or homes would sell them.
[time=1561] Some things, this promotes a kind of communal living, it doesn't, the text clearly indicates in the tents of the verbs here that this was an ongoing and continuous action as there was need, people would do this.
[time=1576] Well, we see believers with homes later in Acts, this was something that when there was a need, those who owned them would be willing to sell them and distribute those proceeds, well, we'll just keep reading, would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales and they would lay them, verse 35, at the apostles' feet and they would be distributed to each as any head need.
[time=1601] What an amazing picture, the body of Christ, biblical community, a deep commitment to sharing and experiencing all of life together, the teaching of God's word, the love of the brethren, a willingness to take that love and reach out to others in need and in so doing, finding favor with all people and God bringing those people to faith.
[time=1627] They were fulfilling, they were fulfilling what Jesus had just told them.
[time=1631] A short time earlier, before our Lord had ascended, He had looked many of them in the face, go to Matthew 28, it says in Matthew 28, it was His parting comments, He says, go, my friends, we've been through all we've been through, He says, go now and make disciples of all the nations.
[time=1648] It's what I'm leaving you here to do, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1656] In verse 20, he says, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you and lo, I am with you, always, even to the end of the age.
[time=1666] So when I read all that and when I get reminded of all that and when I begin to have that picture painted for me, again, my friends, I just get so encouraged.
[time=1675] I'm so very thankful that God has moved in the ways that He has moved here and allowed you and I to be a part of something that is so, so transcendent.
[time=1686] You understand that word?
[time=1687] It is just what He allows you and I to be a part of here is transcendent, it is just its other.
[time=1693] It's so beyond us.
[time=1695] It is so, in one sense, it's so high and lofty, it is so amazing, it is so incredible, it is a transcendent God thing that He allows you and I to participate in, in a very real and meaningful way.
[time=1712] We're trying to, the way we say it here, we just, we take all of that and we just say, by God's grace, listen, we say here at Blackhawk, we say, by God's grace, 'cause without it, we couldn't do any of this.
[time=1726] By God's grace and for His glory, trying to help seeking people, find and then know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=1735] That's not just some phrase, you know, we came up with, that's just straight from the pages of Scripture and it represents this unbelievable mission that we're allowed to participate in, helping those who are searching, find and then know what it means to follow Christ, to be a disciple, to be grown in one's faith, to live life and pursue life and ministry the way our Lord did.
[time=1765] That is what so many of us long to be a part of and are thankful that we get to be a part of here in this place.
[time=1773] As I look back, my friends, as I look back on our study of these last couple of weeks, we've been in a series that we've entitled "Generous Living" and as I look back on our study and discussion over these last two weeks on generous living, I'm struck by the clear realization this morning that really it is the generous, my friends who get to participate in the fullness of the church being all that God designed it to be.
[time=1802] Because Matthew 28, the great commission, go and make disciples, baptizing them, teaching all that I have commanded, helping seeking people find and follow Christ, back to the quote earlier, an atmosphere of love and deep devotion where people are welcomed and served, regardless of race, social standing or circumstance.
[time=1821] It will never, ever happen.
[time=1823] None of that ever gets realized in a greedy gathering.
[time=1829] Ever, it just won't happen.
[time=1835] Some things will happen, but those things won't happen.
[time=1838] God's purposes, it becomes clearer and clearer to me as I read and study God's purposes for the local church, get realized and furthered only when the gathering, only when that body is a generous people with their time and their talent and their treasure and what I'm praying and hoping you can see this morning are the enormous, life-giving opportunities that you and I have been given to steward in and through this ministry, opportunities that you and I have been given to take care of and to do well with, opportunities to generously support God's work inside and outside these four walls.
[time=1880] And I realized this week as I thought about it, that you know what, I close my eyes, I can kind of picture this setting, I've told you that before and I look out and I see your faces and I realize that there are a few of you really, there are in the end a few of you who really do have kind of an ongoing, very up-to-date sense of all that God is doing in and through this ministry that he allows us to be a part of.
[time=1906] There are a lot of you that don't.
[time=1910] I mean, a lot of you get a picture over here, a lot of you might get a glimpse over here, there's a whole bunch of you out there that don't get the privilege of the vantage point that some of us have as we watch God do what he's doing with his church.
[time=1926] And as we talk about our reality today and as we talk about the opportunity God's given you and I to support this work, I wanted to just start.
[time=1936] And if you'd give me this, I'd really appreciate the chance to just take a few minutes and I want to just kind of rapid fire in a sense, but I want to just, I want to overwhelm you.
[time=1945] I want to encourage you.
[time=1947] I want you to see and begin to understand all that he is doing.
[time=1952] And I want you in seeing that to be so very encouraged.
[time=1955] And I want you to sense the connection between what he's doing and your time and your talent and your treasure.
[time=1965] He doesn't need us.
[time=1967] We've established that.
[time=1970] He could do it all on his own.
[time=1973] He has chosen to allow you and I to partner in this greatest of all endeavors.
[time=1978] And he calls you and I to offer him our time and our abilities and our treasures to see this stuff go forward.
[time=1986] Can I just, can I just take a few minutes and let me just talk to you about a few things here that I am so encouraged by.
[time=1992] Some things that you might be aware of, some things you might not be aware.
[time=1996] But just check this out, okay?
[time=1998] Let me just start with this, the vine.
[time=2000] Let me just talk to you for a moment about the vine.
[time=2002] The vine is a ministry that was started not too long ago to try and help.
[time=2007] Listen, help meet the physical needs.
[time=2009] The everyday, real physical needs of everyday people right here in this family.
[time=2014] People in our family who are really struggling for a number of reasons.
[time=2019] And we meet with them and we talk that through and we come to a point where we're able to make some of those needs available to you as a family.
[time=2027] Those needs hang on white cards out there on the vine and look, look with me back over the last year.
[time=2033] 64 families, 64 Black Hawk families have been impacted by the vine.
[time=2039] 167 lives, $66,000 has been donated by the Black Hawk family to help those in need.
[time=2049] 130 Black Hawk families made financial and/or material donations to the vine.
[time=2055] Praise God, didn't that encouraging?
[time=2059] Real people with real needs and you and I get the privilege of being a part of that very thing, Operation Christmas Child.
[time=2066] I won't belabor that, we've talked about that.
[time=2068] What a great opportunity for you and I with a little bit of time and a little bit of treasure to put together a shoebox full of some basic needs that will absolutely light a kid up half a world away.
[time=2082] You and I offering giving ourselves towards something like Operation Christmas Child, global ministries, global ministries.
[time=2090] Some of you may know this, others of you may not.
[time=2092] Listen to this, I learned, okay?
[time=2094] I'm supposed to kind of have my hands on a lot of things around here.
[time=2098] I learned some things as this was given to me this week.
[time=2102] Black Hawk supports 43 missionary families, I knew that.
[time=2106] There won't be any stats on the screen.
[time=2107] Just listen, Black Hawk supports 43 missionary families.
[time=2111] 24 of those 43 families are Black Hawk members.
[time=2116] Grown-up raised came to Christ right here at Black Hawk in our church or school.
[time=2121] They serve in 20 countries.
[time=2123] Nine of our missionary families are engaged in church planting endeavors in 15 different countries.
[time=2130] Five of those 43 families are living and working and doing ministry for the kingdom in places where missionaries are not allowed.
[time=2139] They're not allowed there.
[time=2145] And yet five of our families are in those very places.
[time=2148] The Coles, hope I'll get the name right.
[time=2152] I think it's Ken and Alice, is that right, Neil?
[time=2157] Ken and Alice Cole, it's great having Neil here to help you with names from 25 years back.
[time=2162] The Coles, bless their hearts, listen to this, Ken and Alice have established a counseling center.
[time=2168] This happened over a year and a half ago.
[time=2170] They established a counseling center in the region hardest hit by the tsunami in Thailand.
[time=2176] Our missionaries come in and with the help of others, establish a counseling center to help people deal with the unbelievable loss that goes on.
[time=2184] Now, that counseling center in the last year and a half has subsequently become a church where lives are being changed and nationals there in that place are being redeemed.
[time=2197] And the gospel and the truth is going forward in what used to be a counseling center.
[time=2203] A church has now been established.
[time=2205] Ruth Yokem, we've supported Ruth for years, over 20, 25 years Ruth serves in a hospital in Bangladesh as a result of her outreach and those that work with her 20 churches have been established in what is a closed Muslim country.
[time=2221] Thousands of people have been saved because when they came from medical treatment, they got spiritual treatment as well.
[time=2230] The ballasts, I believe it's Mike and Carolyn, the ballasts in the Philippines and the Colliers in Costa Rica, see people saved nearly every week and are both establishing and planting new churches in their region on a regular basis.
[time=2247] Back to the Coles, Ken and Alice in Thailand.
[time=2250] Do you know why they live in Thailand?
[time=2251] The Coles live in Thailand so they can help facilitate and they have to get creative at times in doing this, but the Coles are in Thailand to help Filipino Christians gain entrance into China and become missionaries.
[time=2267] You've got dear brothers and sisters in the Philippines who are coming to faith in Christ.
[time=2273] God's growing a heart in them to reach the people of China and so that's sometimes a hard thing to do so to get into China, Ken and Alice help them kind of detour through Thailand and they begin to help place Filipino nationals to do missions work as the kingdom goes forward in a place called China.
[time=2292] Kathy Bristol, she's a medical missionary in Ghana, she's a nurse, Kathy Bristol gives her life every day in competition with witch doctors.
[time=2305] I don't know what you're up against every day.
[time=2309] Kathy's up against witch doctors who try every day to move people away from the hope and the healing that she desires to bring, witch doctors who want to move them toward bondage and hopelessness and darkness.
[time=2325] Eight missionaries work directly.
[time=2329] Eight of our 43 work directly with the evangelization and discipling of young people, young people who are trying to be abducted by the enemy, trying to be kidnapped today in a culture that wants them moved away from which true and right and good.
[time=2345] Along with global ministries and our missions opportunities, there is the Antioch Initiative.
[time=2351] You've heard me talk about it.
[time=2353] The Antioch Initiative is a collaborative effort between five churches in the Northeast Indiana region.
[time=2358] We are one of those churches and we are so thankful to get to partner with these churches in this effort to make this investment in a central church in a place called Ivanovo, a long way away in what used to be the Soviet Union, Bob Purdy and Brian Denny just returned from Ivanovo.
[time=2375] I was there last October.
[time=2376] I'm going back next June.
[time=2378] Corbin's coming with other people from the Fort Wayne area, Scott Qualls and John Souch and others are going over on a regular basis to help train and encourage these rural, dear, precious guys who are trying to lead churches in a very, very barren place.
[time=2398] I think currently, as we looked at it just the other day, I think we've invested somewhere in the neighborhood of $70,000 from the Black Hawk budget to help in this endeavor, the Antioch Initiative, the Bible Hour.
[time=2412] My friends, I get 10 to 15 letters a week, emails or letters, 10 to 15 and that's conservative, each and every week, week after week.
[time=2422] I will go in the office tomorrow and there they will be.
[time=2425] And they are there every single week and it's not the same people.
[time=2430] The letters come from Garrett, the letters come from Auburn, the letters come from Southern Michigan, the letters come from Western Ohio, the letters come from Aussie and the letters come from Fort Wayne.
[time=2439] They come from wherever you can think of that Channel 21 has a reach to.
[time=2443] I mean, they just come from everywhere and they say in many ways different things but in some ways the same things.
[time=2450] They are so grateful for what God brings into that home or living room, into that heart and life week after week.
[time=2458] Many of them sound just like this.
[time=2460] This was a recent one.
[time=2461] I grew up, I grew up manipulated, controlled and eventually abused by the church.
[time=2469] For years I've stayed away from the church where the heart filled with anger and distrust until eight months ago I found the Bible Hour.
[time=2480] I heard you say that Black Hawk was a safe place to hear a life changing message and something inside me said I could trust you.
[time=2490] Now I do want you to know that scares me when I hear that last line there and you would understand as I would the spirit with which that was spoken.
[time=2502] And our hope is that while you might trust us our hope is to come alongside any of you and help you transfer all of that trust away from us to him, amen?
[time=2515] But there are people who haven't trusted anybody for years.
[time=2520] And the Lord takes cameras and a lot of guys and gals
[time=2527] who work very hard to produce that broadcast and it gets sent out all over the place and people like this right in goes on and says I now come every week, you may be here right now.
[time=2541] If you are, we're really, really thankful.
[time=2546] And I have never felt so welcomed or encouraged in all my life.
[time=2549] The Word of God which has spoken so clearly and so honestly is changing me.
[time=2553] And for me it all began watching church on TV at seven a.m. on Sundays.
[time=2557] I know of seven others in my own circle of friends that are now watching or recording the broadcast.
[time=2563] If it were me, I would record.
[time=2564] Seven's a little early.
[time=2567] Are now watching or recording the broadcast, please.
[time=2571] They say please at the end, please be encouraged.
[time=2574] And then a PS, would you ever consider having video of your messages available on your website?
[time=2580] And I didn't know the answer to that, but I asked and I hear we're actually working on that.
[time=2584] To have the broadcast, the actual message portion of the broadcast available on the website for folks to watch.
[time=2591] Student Ministries, I'm just gonna go through a list here.
[time=2595] Student Ministries.
[time=2597] We just finished a five week series, my friends.
[time=2599] We just finished drawing a really big line in the sand and putting a really big stake in the ground.
[time=2604] It said, you know what, our kids are facing a level of temptation.
[time=2608] They are in the midst of a barrage of attack by the enemy to move them away from what's true and right and good.
[time=2615] And we wanna do everything we can to try and encourage them, to try and teach them, to try and love them, to try and walk through this life with them in a way that would make a difference.
[time=2625] A mother writes in, as I reflect on your recent kidnap series, I just wanted you to know that until two months ago, I was certain that my son had been abducted by the enemy.
[time=2635] The choices he was making and the attitude of rage and disrespect that he was harboring left me convinced that he was beyond rescue and worst of all without hope.
[time=2645] Then he was encouraged by a friend to attend your high school ministry event on a Wednesday night.
[time=2651] It's called 212.
[time=2653] Since that night, God has been doing a miracle.
[time=2656] Jesse's influence, along with others who volunteer the teaching that takes place and the unconditional acceptance he has received from other boys his age has brought about a change of heart and attitude I would never have thought possible.
[time=2670] Please pass along my deepest thanks and appreciation.
[time=2673] My son has come home.
[time=2675] (audience applauds)
[time=2682] See, I don't know, I don't know if your heart's moved.
[time=2684] I don't know if you're down in your soul as you read this, as you hear this, as we have this discussion, I don't know if your heart is moved, if it isn't, I'm concerned for you.
[time=2693] We should be so amazed and so very grateful that he allows our feeble efforts to produce this kind of work.
[time=2704] Small groups, I believe with all my heart, my friends, I believe with everything in me that God does a great thing.
[time=2713] God does a miraculous thing in the pew.
[time=2717] In settings like this, as the word of God is taught, I believe the spirit of God and this life-changing word, I believe he does an amazing thing in the hearts and lives of people.
[time=2728] What I've learned over the years is that unless what begins here and what God furthers here, unless that's worked out, 70 minutes is a great thing.
[time=2739] But I tell you what, unless we're working that stuff out in the context of real and honest and accountable relationships, the way we say it here is life change happens in its optimal form in settings that provide intimacy, honesty and accountability.
[time=2755] I need help living out my faith.
[time=2758] I mean, that's the bottom line.
[time=2760] I'm to work out my faith, the scriptures teach and fear and trembling.
[time=2764] I am to go into the everyday of my life and to do that in a way that would make a difference, I need help.
[time=2770] I need continued teaching.
[time=2772] I need continued encouragement.
[time=2774] I need continued reminders.
[time=2776] I need the family of God.
[time=2777] I need community.
[time=2779] People willing to live and face all of my life, not just the good stuff, but the hard things.
[time=2784] I need so much more than a few verses punch and some cake.
[time=2788] I need to sit with some people who want to really, really help me as ugly and as confusing and as challenging as it gets.
[time=2798] We need settings that will promote that, encourage that.
[time=2804] It was obvious, this couple writes in, it was obvious from the beginning that God was working in our lives to put together an incredible, small group of couples, blended families.
[time=2814] This was their calling.
[time=2816] They sensed God moving in their hearts with others to start a group of blended families who were struggling with many of the same things we were.
[time=2824] We started as strangers and now have grown to love each other deeply in the midst of huge obstacles in our lives.
[time=2830] In our first few meetings, even to say a simple prayer was very difficult for many of us.
[time=2836] Over the past three years, God has grown us in prayer, saved some of our marriages, helped us to maintain and build relationships with our spouses and kids.
[time=2848] We laugh, we cry, we carry each others burdens and times when we don't have the strength to do it alone.
[time=2854] We cannot even imagine going through the very difficult trials that come with being remarried without the amazing support and encouragement from these friendships that continue to direct and focus us on God, His grace, His love, His word and His strength.
[time=2871] We are truly blessed.
[time=2874] [AMEN] That can take place in a living room, community and accountability and that kind of love and support.
[time=2883] It takes place in many of our other settings with those in our classes.
[time=2888] It can take place with three guys in our restaurant booth.
[time=2891] I mean, there are a number of settings in which it can transpire.
[time=2894] We just wanna continue to see it transpire.
[time=2898] Men's and women's ministry.
[time=2900] I got a note from a gal this week.
[time=2901] She says, as I mentioned, when we saw each other, this Tuesday morning study on prayer is the first opportunity I've taken to be involved in the women's ministry's Bible study here at Blackock.
[time=2912] First of all, most of the ladies in my group were new to me.
[time=2916] I may have known their faces, but I knew very little about them personally and I feel God had His hand placing me in this group.
[time=2922] I have been struggling with fatigue and being accountable to read the word and pray daily with my Lord.
[time=2928] These ladies have been incredible prayer warriors on my behalf and I have been uplifted by them every week.
[time=2935] I have also been convicted in my relationship with the Lord these past few weeks as I've listened to Karen's teachings.
[time=2943] I now realize that I must focus on the eternal when I pray for people, even if it means they may suffer hardship instead of praying that the hardship be relieved.
[time=2955] I'm praying confessionally for the very first time with others where I focus on how I've sinned and where we focus on how all of us have sinned like in Daniel 9 and we together ask for forgiveness together instead of silently praying confessions or not confessing at all.
[time=2975] The death ministry, I'm so amazed at what God has done
[time=2981] in something like the death ministry.
[time=2983] You may not even know we've got one.
[time=2986] We have a gal, Brent Imer, our pastor and lead in the global ministries arena, wrote this up for me.
[time=2993] He has kind of walked through this with our friend Val.
[time=2996] It's a very cool story, Brent says as he writes, we have this lady named Val.
[time=3000] I don't think Val is here today.
[time=3003] This is Carol, hi Carol.
[time=3004] Carol's filling in for Val, but check this out.
[time=3006] We have a lady named Val with a deep passion to reach out to the deaf and hearing impaired in our community.
[time=3014] This is how this thing unfolded.
[time=3016] The deaf are almost their own unreached people group.
[time=3019] So Val comes to the staff with her passion, her God given gifts and statistics about the deaf in the Fort Wayne community.
[time=3027] Blackhawk comes alongside.
[time=3029] She is already signing during the services, but then she starts training others.
[time=3034] Here's Carol, she starts training others in the body and in the community to sign.
[time=3039] Her desire to reach out grows more and more and more so and she probably in the end puts in about 100 hours of research on what it would take to bring the Bible hour to the deaf community.
[time=3052] After putting together a volunteer plan, Blackhawk purchases the software to do closed captioning and working with Ed Richard, our producer, creates a system to transcribe the services through the software.
[time=3065] Katie Dwyer does that.
[time=3067] This was no short-term project, taking over a year from the idea to implementation, but today a half dozen volunteers plus Blackhawk staff handle this ministry and the Bible hour is now closed captioned on a regular basis.
[time=3083] [ Applause ]
[time=3089] It's one gal with a huge passion and a willingness to do whatever it might take and a body and some leaders who saw that and were willing to partner in that and God's doing great things.
[time=3104] Christmas with Blackhawk's coming up to over 10,000 people, my friends, we get the privilege of speaking and proclaiming through the arts and the spoken word the greatest story ever told to as many people as you and I can invite and who God would bring to hear that life-changing story.
[time=3122] Legacy, legacy is our ministry led by our senior adults.
[time=3127] It is an amazing opportunity for those in the 55, 60, 65 and even older range to continue to stay engaged in meaningful ministry.
[time=3137] Recently 14 of our legacy folks took a trip and I had my friend Carl and Emily Pearson give me a report and they wrote this, recently 14 people from Blackhawk's legacy group had the opportunity to serve God by volunteering to assist the staff and ministry of child evangelism fellowships, C-E-F.
[time=3157] We spent six days at C-E-F headquarters in Warrington, Missouri.
[time=3162] Our 14 folks, senior adults, got in the cars and drove to Missouri to give a week to help people in need.
[time=3170] C-E-F is not only about five day clubs and good news clubs but it is also an international ministry as well of the three areas that volunteers can serve in, mailbox club, data entry and buildings and grounds.
[time=3184] Most of us worked in the mailbox club processing and grading Bible lessons that this organization sends out all over the world.
[time=3194] These lessons help establish children, teens, adults and prisoners in their faith and encourage them in spiritual growth.
[time=3202] The testimonies from it are amazing.
[time=3204] Lives are being changed.
[time=3205] During the week, we, the Blackhawk team, processed 14 to 15,000 lessons.
[time=3213] Despite decisions for Christ's average around 150 per weekend, every one of them is followed up on serving at C-E-F, you know, you are making a difference.
[time=3222] Last but not least was the fellowship and relationship building that took place between our own team, getting to know each other better.
[time=3230] We look forward to next year and want to encourage more senior adults from Blackhawk to become involved.
[time=3236] Amen? Hot shots between the ages of kindergarten and third grade, beginning next Saturday, we'll have a chance to minister and speak into the lives of over a hundred families, many of whom have never, ever played basketball and at the same time been given a spiritual emphasis.
[time=3253] Blackhawk Christian School, I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[time=3257] Now, the reality, my friends, is this,
[time=3266] the reality is that in large part, much, not all, but so much of all that we just talked about is made possible
[time=3277] by the generous God-honoring giving of the Church, the giving of time, the giving of your and mind of our abilities, the giving of our treasures.
[time=3289] When the redeemed on the financial front, you know, when the redeemed, when the family of God bring their offerings, their gifts, ministry, and those leading and supporting those ministries is funded.
[time=3301] And there is a financial structure in place here at Blackhawk that allows that ministry inside and outside these four walls from Kathy Bristol in competition with witch doctors to the lights that got turned on this morning.
[time=3317] All of it, there is a financial structure in place that allows it all to be resourced, and it's called a budget.
[time=3326] Now, just the mere mention of the word deflated about half of you.
[time=3332] We're cruising along here talking about kingdom stuff and lives being changed and witch doctors and pastors in Russia and kids coming to faith and families getting rescued, and I say the word budget.
[time=3345] And sometimes we just kind of go south on the whole -- once we hear budget, we think mortgage payments and carpets
[time=3354] and plants on stage and all kinds of stuff.
[time=3359] And you know what, a budget includes some of those things.
[time=3363] But what I'm wanting you to see this morning and what I'm wanting you to catch, and we're going to continue to talk about it next week in a very specific and a very straightforward way, is that our budget, the financial structure, which funds and resources so much of what we get to do, it's a very, very cool thing.
[time=3383] I want to ask you this question as we leave today.
[time=3385] I've been asking you this question for three weeks, and I'm just going to ask it to you again.
[time=3390] I'm going to ask you to just have the integrity of heart to leave this place asking yourself again this question.
[time=3396] Is there room?
[time=3399] Is there any room in your heart and life?
[time=3403] You all have to answer this.
[time=3405] I have to answer this, is there any room in you for greater levels of generosity, a willingness to give freely and radically your time and your talent and your treasure?
[time=3420] I think God felt like there was room in the people of Israel.
[time=3424] And he says in Malachi 3.8, he says, will a man rob God?
[time=3428] I think he connects robbing God with saying,
[time=3435] nope, I'm tapped out.
[time=3437] I really don't have any more room in me, Kelly, for greater levels of generosity.
[time=3443] And I think for those in the room who might say that, if that's a lie, if that's not true, if there really is, but you just don't want to say it, I know there are times I don't want to.
[time=3453] I think he will a man rob God.
[time=3460] Yet you are robbing me, but you say, how have we robbed you in tithes and offerings?
[time=3465] He goes on in verse 9, you are cursed with a curse for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you.
[time=3471] And he says in verse 10, bring the whole tithe.
[time=3476] Whatever room is there in you for greater levels of generosity, he says, bring it.
[time=3482] Bring the whole thing, whatever that is for you.
[time=3485] Bring it all.
[time=3487] Don't hold anything back.
[time=3489] Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house.
[time=3494] And test me now in this.

[time=3498] Watch what I'll do, says the Lord of Host.

[time=3528] I know there's room in me for greater levels.
[time=3531] And I'd like to explore that with you in the days to come.
[time=3534] Amen?
