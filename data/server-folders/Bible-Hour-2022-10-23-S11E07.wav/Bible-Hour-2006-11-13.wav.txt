[time=306] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=321] And it is really good, really good today to be with you.
[time=324] And I say really good, because as I sat down today in this chair and looked at the camera, I realized it's been a while since we've been together.
[time=332] And you may not have noticed, and if you didn't, it's no big deal.
[time=335] But I just want you to know, I've noticed, I think it's been three weeks since I've gotten to sit here and have these few minutes with you.
[time=342] And I view this as a chance for you and I to connect.
[time=346] And I hear from so many of you, I hear from people in the grocery store, I bump into folks,
[time=353] the gas station, I see people out and about in the community.
[time=357] And they, you tell me, you say, I listen to you, I feel like I know you.
[time=362] And I want you to know, I feel like I know you.
[time=365] I feel like with many of you, we've got a friendship and the chance to just speak into that relationship for a few minutes like this, I really look forward to it.
[time=373] I've missed you, so it's good to see you again.
[time=375] Hey, I want you to know, in recent weeks, if you've been watching the broadcast, you know, we find ourselves coming to the end of a study that we've entitled "Generous Living." And I cannot begin to tell you how thrilled I am, how thankful I am, how encouraged I
[time=390] am with what I've seen God do in and through the series.
[time=393] You know, we began several weeks ago and we looked at the generosity of God.
[time=399] And it had been a while since I'd done that.
[time=401] We studied how generous God has been to you and to me, the ways in which He has given
[time=407] Himself, the ways in which He gave His Son, the grace and the mercy and the forgiveness and the new life, all that He has generously given.
[time=416] And we realized pretty quick that really all of life then is our response to the generosity
[time=423] of God.
[time=425] And my hope has been, and as we've continued the study, my prayer has been that you and I would be generous in our response and that we would be willing to admit that there probably
[time=437] are and there probably is greater levels of generosity that we could give, that we could offer God and others, specifically with our time and our talent and our treasure.
[time=448] And I hope you've been listening.
[time=450] If you haven't, I just encourage you to go to the website.
[time=453] On the website, you can download the "Generous Living" series.
[time=457] You can now watch from our website.
[time=459] This is a new development.
[time=460] You can now watch the Bible Hour, the message portion of the Bible Hour on the website.
[time=465] You can see the video, the whole nine yards.
[time=467] If you haven't been watching, I would encourage you to do so.
[time=471] If you have been watching, you know, either way, I want to just say this to you this morning.
[time=475] Be generous.
[time=477] I mean that.
[time=478] Be generous.
[time=481] There's something about kindness and there's something about a sensitivity to God and the
[time=487] needs of others.
[time=488] The needs of others in your own backyard, the needs of others in your family, the needs of others across the world.
[time=494] You and I cannot begin to tell you the opportunities that are beginning to unfold for us here at Blackhawk to exercise and extend generosity in so many different settings.
[time=504] I can't wait for you to watch today.
[time=507] As we go through our service, there's a Russian family.
[time=510] I can't wait for you to meet that we've now connected with over in Russia and the Yvonne of O'Reagan.
[time=516] There's so much going on.
[time=517] I just want to say this to you.
[time=519] Be generous.
[time=520] Be generous with your time.
[time=522] Be generous with your abilities, with your talent.
[time=526] Be generous with your giving, with your resources, with your treasure.
[time=531] Those of you who have home churches, many of you watch the Bible hour and have home churches that you're a part of.
[time=536] Be generous in the way that you give and support that.
[time=540] I'm so very thankful for what God's doing through the church of Fort Wayne and when the church of Fort Wayne, and that's you, and that's me, when we live with a response of generosity to him and others, he takes that response and he does miraculous life-changing
[time=556] stuff in our lives and in the lives of others, and so I just want to say thanks for your support and your encouragement and I want to encourage you this morning to live generously in every opportunity God gives you.
[time=569] God bless you.
[time=570] Have a great week, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=586] Have a great week, and as always, we love and I've been invited, I want to share the
[time=599] invitation.
[time=600] I have been changed to bring change, to bring change, to bring change, to sing that together.
[time=606] We have been blessed, now we're going to be a blessing, and we have been loved, and we
[time=613] have been loving, and we have been loved, now we're going to bring love, and we've been
[time=623] invited.
[time=624] We're going to share the invitation, and we have been changed to bring change, to bring
[time=633] change, to bring change, to sing that whole chorus one time.
[time=638] We have been blessed, now we're going to be a blessing, and we have been loved, now we're
[time=650] going to bring love, and we've been invited, and we're going to share the invitation.
[time=660] We have been changed to bring change, to bring change, and we have been changed to bring
[time=672] change, to bring change.
[time=677] Amen, thank you.
[time=683] Most of you know about the Antioch Initiative.
[time=684] You see it there on the screen.
[time=686] The third bullet point down.
[time=688] A collaborative effort between five churches in the northeast Indiana area, most of them from the Fort Wayne community, five churches coming together to try our very best with God's help to make a deposit into the hearts and lives of those in a church in a place far away called Yvonneville.
[time=705] In what used to be the Soviet Union, there is a faithful man and his family, Pastor Vladimir, Yometham, he was here several weeks ago, Vladimir, his associate pastor, Sergei, and his wife
[time=716] and family.
[time=717] Two guys and the family of the church there in Yvonneville have over the years given themselves to what God is doing in that region, and God has really blessed their efforts.
[time=726] It is a, on a Russian scale, it is a really strong church, and these are good people who
[time=734] God is building a strong ministry in the midst of.
[time=737] Now what has happened is that God has, over the years, through Vladimir's leadership and
[time=743] through Sergei's efforts, there are about 25 to 30 other pastors who have kind of come
[time=750] under Vladimir's leadership, and these 25 to 30 young men and their wives and kids, they
[time=756] are missionaries.
[time=757] They are missionary pastors to mostly smaller, rural settings in the outlying region around
[time=764] Ivanovo, and Vladimir and Sergei continue to make an investment in these guys' lives.
[time=768] These guys need help.
[time=770] These 25 to 30, they need a lot of help.
[time=773] They need a lot of training.
[time=775] They need a lot of encouragement.
[time=777] They need us to come alongside and love on them and help them grow.
[time=782] And you know what?
[time=783] When we do that, as we've been going over now for a couple of years, inevitably while we get the chance to help encourage, we get encouraged, we get grown, they are a phenomenal
[time=793] group of men, faithful men who live and exist in a culture so much more challenging in
[time=801] so many ways than what you and I experience in the day-to-day of life.
[time=805] And so, there's been a great relationship formed.
[time=808] As I had a chance to go over last year with Ben Imer and with Jason and Andrew Mayley,
[time=815] there was just a further bond developed.
[time=818] And as we were there last year with the 25 guys teaching them through, I think the class
[time=824] I taught was a whole week on preaching.
[time=828] And at the conclusion of that week, as we were leaving, it was at night time, it was
[time=834] late, we were tired, we were literally the four of us getting in our van.
[time=838] And as we were getting in our van, a car pulls up, and I say to Vladimir, "Who's that?" And Vladimir says, "Oh my goodness." And it was a couple, it was a man and his wife and two little girls.
[time=850] And they were pulling up to the church, they had just been picked up from the train station, they were just into Ivanovo from Siberia where they had packed up everything they owned.
[time=859] And the three duffel bags in the front seat, that was it, that was everything they owned.
[time=864] And here was this mom and dad and these two little girls and I'm telling you, I have rarely in my life seen a look on a face like the look I saw in their faces that night.
[time=873] Saucer-eyed was the mom and dad, just in a new place, in a place far away from their
[time=880] own home and family with new people they had never met, but they knew Vladimir.
[time=885] And God had called them to come and join Vladimir's effort and they knew Vladimir would, and the church there in Ivanovo would in time place them in a spot where they could do ministry.
[time=896] And I just looked at that guy's face, Brent and I both, and I think Andy and Jason Psalm
[time=902] as well, and there was just something in me that connected.
[time=904] And so over the next several months I kept asking, can we find out who he was?
[time=909] Can we find out what his name is?
[time=911] Can we find out where they've been placed?
[time=914] And Brent has been faithful in that endeavor and we have found them.
[time=917] Vladimir knew exactly who he was and over these last few months we've come to the point where now Anatoly and Enya and their two little girls are ours.
[time=932] We get the chance and Bob, Bob Purdy and Brian Denny, they were just over there.
[time=938] Most of you know that.
[time=939] And Bob and Brian really had the privilege of initiating this new relationship.
[time=944] We will continue to support the 25.
[time=946] We will continue to support the Antioch Initiative.
[time=949] This family, my friends, the plate came to them.
[time=955] As Bob, he and Brian brought to them their first $450, which is what they need to live
[time=961] on in order to be freed up to work full time.
[time=965] In a town of 200 to 250,000 people, an hour or so away from Ivanovo that has not one single
[time=973] church.
[time=976] Do you know how many churches are in this city of ours?
[time=980] This is a town of 250,000 people and there is not a church in the town.
[time=989] And they have no friends, they have no family.
[time=992] They have only this call of God in their heart to be placed in this town, to begin to do the work of ministry, to build relationships and to try and begin to teach and proclaim
[time=1002] which is true and right and good, and we get to help.
[time=1007] We get to help.
[time=1008] I want you to see a picture here.
[time=1009] That is the whole crew right there, Anatoly, Anya, there are two girls, seven and two years of age.
[time=1013] I think there is a shot here of Brian and Bob and then there they are.
[time=1017] And I just want you to see the looks on their faces.
[time=1020] I know Bob and Brian, I know how grateful they are to get to be there.
[time=1023] I want you to see Anatoly and Anya and those girls.
[time=1026] They are so thankful that they get to do what they do.
[time=1030] I want you to see this too.
[time=1032] They prepared a meal and I learned from my time over there, I learned this to be true.
[time=1036] I want you to see that, that is the meal and I want you to understand that right there
[time=1042] in that picture, that right there, that salad and that meat, those candies and that coleslaw,
[time=1049] that was like killing the fatted calf.
[time=1052] I want you to understand that it meant so much to them that Bob and Brian were there and that that meal right there cost them dearly.
[time=1062] They paid and gave more for that meal right there than they would for three, four, five weeks as a family.
[time=1072] They are so grateful and this is the life they live.
[time=1076] I wanted you to see the kitchen where the meal was prepared.
[time=1080] There she is, Anya and her kitchen and then you can look at the picture long enough you can kind of figure out the dimensions there, a tight little space to squeeze through and
[time=1092] that's her kitchen.
[time=1094] She's so thankful for that kitchen and the chance to prepare meals and she was so thankful
[time=1101] to be able to prepare that meal for Bob and for Brian and for Vladimir and Sergey.
[time=1108] The girls are sweet girls and the family is so grateful for their apartment.
[time=1111] I want to say this about the apartment.
[time=1113] They've purchased this apartment.
[time=1116] They've been able to purchase this apartment and while we're providing $450 a month for them to be able to be freed up to do ministry, the mortgage on the apartment that remains
[time=1127] is $2,000 and that's a mortgage that for them is a heavy burden but one they're willing
[time=1135] to shoulder as they give themselves to ministry.
[time=1138] This is a view of their apartment.
[time=1140] There's the kitchen you saw, there's the restroom, oh that's the bathing room and that's where
[time=1146] Anatolian Inya and the girls bathe, that's their restroom and there's the crew right there
[time=1155] and they are so thankful for their restroom and so grateful for their bath and shower
[time=1164] and I just want you to know how thankful we are for the opportunity to come alongside them.
[time=1170] We are there for them now to be a source of encouragement, to be a source of funding, to be a source of ongoing training and teaching a relationship that I hope we can together
[time=1180] you and I cherish for years and years and years.
[time=1183] I was already approached four times after the first hour and if you want to approach
[time=1189] me after second hour, feel free.
[time=1192] I think we've almost got their mortgage paid off.
[time=1199] If there's any, if there's any room in your heart for greater levels of generosity with
[time=1208] your time and your talent and your treasure, God is so very interested in us being a generous
[time=1216] people and there are so many opportunities inside and outside these four walls that he
[time=1222] gives you and I the privilege of partnering with.
[time=1225] [AMEN] Well, hey, let me just, if I can, I wanted to show you where the plate had gotten to and
[time=1232] I want to kind of come back this morning and again, remind all of us where the plate, if you will, begins and this is where we left off last week.
[time=1240] I want it to this morning in just a very honest and open way, share with you, give you a picture of kind of the fiscal reality here at Blackhawk.
[time=1248] Many of you last week told me how much it meant to you to hear these stories and to learn more about our ministries because you just never knew that all that was going on.
[time=1258] Well, in kind of that same vein along those same lines, I want you to see this morning some things that maybe normally you wouldn't see to gain an understanding into some things that maybe normally you wouldn't understand and I want to just try and do it briefly and then I want to get to the, get to the point.
[time=1273] Okay.
[time=1274] Blackhawk's fiscal reality, some of you may know this, some of you may not but this is just kind of a general overview of our ministry budget and I'll just show you that first screen.
[time=1283] The church budget and then the Blackhawk Christian school budget, both budgets being combined
[time=1289] to create a total budget figure.
[time=1292] And there you have it right there on the screen, 2,720 on the church side, 2,947 on the school
[time=1299] side for a total budget of $5,667,525.
[time=1309] So you look at that and I just tell you what, just, I mean, I knew all that but I remember just first hour seeing that on the screen, the thought hit me, my goodness, that's a lot of money.
[time=1319] That's $5 million.
[time=1323] And I don't say that like, wow, hey, look at our budget, there's five million, I don't say it like that.
[time=1329] I'm saying to you with kind of almost a renewed sense of awe and responsibility and opportunity,
[time=1341] I'm just saying to you, my goodness, look what he has entrusted, look what he has provided,
[time=1351] look what he's, look what he's able to do through you and me and this opportunity he has given us to do ministry here inside these four walls and beyond, it's quite a privilege.
[time=1363] The second thing I want you to see is just simply some of the breakdowns and we could get really, really detailed here but we won't, I want you to know that of that $5,667 figure,
[time=1372] 51% goes to salaries and benefits for church staff.
[time=1378] There are some faces that go along with that church staff, you can see the picture there on the screen, those, that's our school staff, actually there's our church staff and, you
[time=1388] know, all their wives and their families and there's a whole bunch of other folks that are in the church staff umbrella and that 51% goes to support all of those guys and all
[time=1400] of those that work with them and all of those ministries, 9% goes to global ministries and the vine, our effort to reach out to this world that God's placed us in, 9% goes to global
[time=1412] ministries and the vine, 31% goes to operations, facilities and maintenance, 9% going to general
[time=1420] ministry expenses.
[time=1422] What is that?
[time=1423] Well that is children's ministry, that is men's and women's ministry, that is student ministries,
[time=1429] speaking of student ministries by the way, the balconies are a bit empty this morning although we do have some folks up there, good to see all of you, usually that's where all of our high school kids are sitting, I just want you to know 110 high school kids went to fall camp this weekend with Jesse and his team up to Lake James, 110 high school kids
[time=1450] are up, they're on their way home right now we hope but thank God for what God continues to do in and through that ministry, anyway there's your breakdown, I did want to show
[time=1461] you this, this is something we don't talk about a whole lot, it's just been kind of an understood thing for years and yet when you put numbers to it it just shows you the
[time=1471] kind of investment and the kind of commitment we have to something that we really, really value and that's our school.
[time=1477] I want you to know all, I want you to know thirdly that of the church, of the total church budget of $2,720,000 it is estimated that $400,000 a year of that is dedicated to the
[time=1491] support of Black Hawk Christian school and that's just amazing to me, I am so thankful
[time=1497] Doug Crane would tell you that conservatively a third of our entire operations budget maintenance
[time=1503] and repairs, administrative support, physical plan upkeep, utilities, capital improvements, mortgage payment, all that covered by the church and gladly because we are so thankful
[time=1514] for the privilege that we get to eight hours a day, five days a week for nine months out of the year make a spiritual and life investment into these kids and their families, it is huge and what God is doing these days as he's growing our preschool and expanding our reach
[time=1532] into the homes and communities here in our vicinity it is absolutely thrilling and I'm so thankful that that number is what it is.
[time=1542] For all of that to transpire, for all of that to take place you know the elders meet on a regular basis we prayerfully think through the establishing of a yearly budget and when that budget is established then there comes out of that process kind of a weekly figure
[time=1557] and you see that weekly figure every week there in your bulletin and that weekly amount needed to fund and resource all that we've been talking about these last two Sundays, 48,000, 898, now we cut our budget we pulled back on the budget process this year, last
[time=1573] year that number was in the low 50s and because there have been some challenges on this front we felt like it would be a good move in our attempt to faithfully steward what God's giving
[time=1584] us to kind of back off that a bit so we backed off on our budget, we created a vision budget for things we'd like to do but we now have this as our baseline bottom line expense budget
[time=1595] figure 48, 898 and I want to just show you that next slide because this lets you know where we are today and I'll tell you what where we are today is a lot different than where we were last week and I'm so thankful for that God is doing something in your hearts
[time=1610] God is doing something in this family and I am so encouraged still concerned about some
[time=1617] things and I'll just share that with you briefly but I just wanted you to see 69,164 behind
[time=1623] in budgeted giving people will ask me they'll say what do you think about that number they'll say when you see that number 69, 70,000 down what goes through your heart and mind and I want to just tell you basically for the most part it's twofold there is a part of me as
[time=1639] I look at that number that experiences a growing concern I mean when I see that number most
[time=1646] of you would realize that when the number is at that level then people in my position and others who give leadership begin to have to think through difficult decisions when you are behind at that level then you have to start thinking about pulling pulling back
[time=1661] you you would know me and you would know us we love to think about going forward but you
[time=1668] have to try your best to be faithful with what God's given you and so when you get into a spot like this ministry budgets begin to be reduced ministry plans begin to be put on hold resources begin to be withheld expense accounts start to get frozen and that's just
[time=1686] what you do and so there's a part of me as I see that number and I think about this opportunity that God's given us that it's concerning to me it's a frustration but I want to say this to you way above and beyond my concern or my frustration about those things I just mentioned
[time=1704] is the fact that that number represents I believe that scripture teaches that that number
[time=1714] says something about my heart I believe that number says something about our hearts because
[time=1725] where your treasure is Jesus said there will be your heart and I want to be really really
[time=1732] clear with you on this one I am not asking you to fix that number this series has not
[time=1743] been about getting to week four and me asking you to cough up more cash to fix that number
[time=1750] now if you've been here you know the honest truth is that for these past three weeks we've
[time=1756] been talking about the posture of your heart we have been talking about the posture of your
[time=1762] soul toward God and others and I have been asking you week after week and I will ask you again today is there any room is there room in your heart and life for greater levels
[time=1773] of generosity toward God and others with your time and your talent and your resources and
[time=1780] here's the deal if the collective answer of this entire body if the collective answer
[time=1786] of the family of black cock is no if honestly we would look and stand before God and say
[time=1793] no there's no more room we're tapped out there are no there's no more level there's no levels
[time=1801] left I'm just it's just we're just we're giving time talent and treasure as generously as
[time=1809] we can if you and I are serving those in need both inside and outside these four walls with
[time=1815] as much of our time and talent and treasure as we can give if this is our best offering
[time=1822] that I could sleep while at night and be at peace but here's the deal I know for me for
[time=1830] Kevin and I as we've thought this through I will just stand here and I will say to you as I've asked you that question and as I've asked myself that question the answer is yes
[time=1843] there's more room in me for greater levels of generosity toward God and others and you
[time=1851] know I've never made a habit of standing here and answering for you but on this one I will
[time=1857] say this for ten years if I've learned one thing about you and me I've learned this we're a lot alike I'm no different than you and you're no different than me and we face many of the
[time=1867] same challenges and situations and circumstances in life and I think there's more room in you
[time=1876] for greater levels I think there's more room in us for greater expressions of generosity
[time=1884] with the way we invest our time and our talent and our treasure I believe the 800 million
[time=1890] that won't eat again today remember that figure from week one I believe the 800 million that won't eat again today is our opportunity and I mean that I'm absolutely dead serious I
[time=1905] don't think we can feed all 800 million of them but I feel like in my heart that that
[time=1911] down deep in me I think I should be figuratively or literally holding a spoon more frequently
[time=1917] than I do I think the church and their proclamation of being Christ followers people who think
[time=1926] and and move and live like Jesus thought and lived and moved I think if that's the case and that's who we are we should I should be maybe feeding a few more I believe the twenty
[time=1937] billion dollars needed to address nutrition hunger and disease I gave you that stat three weeks ago twenty billion is what they're saying it will take to in a significant way address nutrition hunger and disease across the world and I think that twenty billion should come from us I believe that with all my heart I believe the church and their proclamation
[time=1960] of and their commitment to follow Christ and to be Jesus to an on looking world should
[time=1967] give in amazing ways towards those kinds of efforts I think the twenty four thousand that will die today twenty four thousand people remember one every three seconds will die today from starvation and I think they should have been fed more and more so by people like
[time=1986] you and me and the church across the world you know what I'm really thankful for Bono
[time=1993] I'm incredibly grateful for world vision I'm so thankful for those who have given so much
[time=1999] and and and responded with such great passion and conviction to help those who are marginalized
[time=2005] and diseased and and poor and in need the church has been a little late in my opinion
[time=2013] just mine I think we've been a little late in jumping into the opportunity to generously
[time=2020] inside these four walls and out meet the needs of the people that God has given us to reach
[time=2026] let me say this to you while I am passionate about and growing in my conviction about the twenty four thousand who will die today I am equally passionate about the fifteen people
[time=2038] that we've needed for about ten weeks now eight to ten weeks we've needed about fifteen people to help draw pictures on crepe paper with kids in our Sunday school setting and
[time=2051] I believe that instead of the four there's about four ladies I'm aware of there's about four gals who have because the fifteen didn't step forward we got about four ladies in our church who haven't been to the gathering here they haven't been to worship service in six weeks because they're just doing double duty to try and keep classrooms open and I think
[time=2073] that's just as significant a statistic as people not being fed I believe others could
[time=2081] have stepped forward bottom line I believe there's more room in you and me and our hearts and lives for increased levels of generosity and I believe God felt the same way about the
[time=2094] people of Israel and Malachi three turn there if you would Malachi three versus eight to ten and this is where we were last week let me remind you of how God came at this he felt
[time=2105] as if the people of Israel were holding back there was greater levels of generosity in
[time=2112] them they could have offered more of their time and talent and in this case specifically their treasure and he says in Malachi three eight will a man rob God yet you you people
[time=2124] who I have been so faithful to and so generous with he says yet you are robbing me but you
[time=2130] say how have we robbed you in tithes and offerings you are cursed with a curse for you are robbing
[time=2137] me the whole nation of you and here it is verse ten bring the whole time this amount that
[time=2144] you could set aside and that you could bring you're not bringing all of it he says bring the whole thing don't rob me bring it into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house and test me trust me now on this he says says the Lord of hosts if I will not
[time=2161] open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows God
[time=2169] is robbed when we withhold our best well how were they withholding their best go back to
[time=2175] chapter one would you just turn the page and go over to Malachi one verse six here's where
[time=2181] he jumps in with him he says a son honors his father and a servant honors his master then if I am a father where is my honor and if I am a master where is my respect says
[time=2192] the Lord of hosts to you oh priests who despised my name but you say how how have we despised
[time=2200] your name you are presenting defiled food upon my altar but you say how have we defiled
[time=2208] you and that you say the table of the Lord is to be despised but here's the answer verse eight but when you present the blind goat or sheep God said to bring a spotless lamb but
[time=2220] when you present the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and when you present the lame
[time=2226] and the sick they were bringing lame blind sick lambs they had the really good goat out
[time=2233] in the pen and they bring to God the leftover is it not evil why not offer it to your governor
[time=2242] would he be pleased with you or would he receive you kindly says the Lord of hosts and
[time=2250] as you read through the text there as I looked at that this week it became clear again to me that this act of giving this offering of the lamb it was so much more than just bringing
[time=2260] something to the plate God views it as an act or an absence of worship it's how it's how
[time=2268] it's one of the ways in which we worship our God by bringing to him our offering a side
[time=2276] note here folks will ask me what I think about automatic debit giving you know we we can do that in some places do where you fill out paperwork and your offering is automatically
[time=2287] debited from your checking account and you never have to what think about it and I'm
[time=2295] not condemning that I just for me there's something about remembering there's something
[time=2302] about thinking about it that I think is so sweet to remember him and to remember what
[time=2308] he's done and to and to write the check or put aside the funds to bring the offering
[time=2314] as an act of worship and God is robbed when we withhold our best let me give you a picture on that one I just want to encourage you somebody told me this years and years ago and sometimes
[time=2325] I remember to do it and sometimes I don't but you can do it with your spouse when you're out to eat you can do it with your kids when you're at the table you can really kind of do it anywhere but if you're ever if you're ever just working your way through a really really nice ribeye or you got yourself a a really nice you know New York stay with me
[time=2345] sometimes you know you just you're looking at that thing and oh gosh I'm so thankful for this or if you're a vegetarian it's a big juicy cucumber with like salt and oil
[time=2356] on it you know I never thought there were vegetarians really I thought it was a myth but then I've met a few there really are some vegetarians which is a different story no big deal but you got this steak in front of you and you may sometimes it's with your
[time=2372] spouse you know and you said to your spouse before you place the order do you want to steak and the spouse said no I don't want a steak well why don't you get a steak it'd be good you'd probably like it no I don't want a steak so then you order the steak and the steaks come and then she wants the steak all of a sudden and so sometimes you go through
[time=2389] that but here's the deal somebody maybe it's your spouse maybe it's your kid they ask you for a bite and there's times I will admit in my greedy sinful soul where I just want
[time=2400] to cut off a piece of gristle for them with just a little bit of meat on it and say there
[time=2406] you can have that somebody a long time ago challenged me in those moments to go to the center of the steak that part you'd work your way to so much fun to work your way to that
[time=2418] part that biggest thickest juiciest part somebody challenged me they said why don't you write then at that moment go to the center of the steak and just cut out the center of the steak in one nice juicy bite and say here I want to give you this first of all yes you can
[time=2434] have a bite second of all I want to give you the best bite I can give you here God says
[time=2444] don't rob me don't give me your gristle give me your best and there's a way I want to just
[time=2451] show you there's there's a way I think that we can ensure or at least move in that direction
[time=2457] I think there's there's something I want to show you here in Proverbs 3 that allows you and I to give him our best and it has to do with putting aside the gift first go to Proverbs 3 if you would look at Proverbs 3 9 and 10 and I want you just to write down somewhere
[time=2472] first fruits giving first fruits giving no just write it down no crumbs for God Proverbs
[time=2480] 3 9 look what it says says there in Proverbs 3 9 honor the Lord from your wealth stop right
[time=2486] there as per our discussion week one raise your hand if you're in the room today and you're wealthy as per our discussion from week one go ahead everybody raise your hand remember everybody in this room if you live in this country if you live in this state if you're here in this community if you drove something to this building if you're going to have a meal today if you've got change in your ashtray in this world today you're
[time=2511] rich and so he says honor the Lord from your wealth and from the first of all your produce
[time=2519] they would in that agrarian culture they would bring the produce in and that would be their payday and from the top of their paycheck the very first thing he says to do is just
[time=2532] take that portion that you're going to give that sacrificial amount and right before you do anything else he says from the first of your produce give the gift look at verse 10
[time=2543] it says if you do that so your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats were overflow
[time=2549] with new wine first fruits giving I think it does three things just write these down I think when you and I are willing with a paycheck let's say the paycheck comes or you
[time=2560] know or the payment arrives with the resources come in to your world and mine however they
[time=2566] come in and then we begin to invest it we begin to make our payments we begin to make
[time=2572] our purchases before any of that happens this is this is talking about you and I before
[time=2578] any of that goes on right off the top we say this is going to be for him and when you practice
[time=2585] that I think three things happen it reveals priorities the practice of first fruits giving
[time=2591] has a way of revealing priorities like what is really what is really most important to you I mean what are you really truly devoted to when you and I practice this kind of giving
[time=2602] it reveals the priorities that truly genuinely exist in our hearts and lives it develops character
[time=2609] I can't tell you how many times when it's time to write that first check when it's time to separate that gift before anything else is done there are so many times in my life
[time=2620] and I'm sure in yours where concurrent with that is the thought of this thing I saw at
[time=2626] Best Buy or this thing I saw in a magazine or this thing I saw at a buddy's house and I want one I have these wants and I want stuff just like you and I know that if I took that
[time=2639] chunk off the top and just put it toward the stuff maybe I could catch up next month on the whole first fruits thing but I want to I want you and I to have character I want
[time=2650] us to understand the bigger picture and sometimes when you practice this it helps develop that kind of discipline and character number three it grows your faith and here's what I want to say about that if you're willing if anybody most people in this room and most people listening
[time=2666] on the broadcast and most of you listening through the website if you write a check right
[time=2673] off the top and it's a sacrificial check it's a gift to God and then you start making your
[time=2679] way through the list and you start making your way through the month if you're like me you know you can't having done that get about halfway through that month and you can
[time=2688] see what's coming and you can begin to think oh my goodness how am I going to do this if I hadn't given that gift see I'd have enough to pay this and then all of a sudden we go boom we flip flop and we stop growing faith and we take control we white knuckle we get
[time=2705] greedy and I'm just here to tell you I've experienced it many of you in the room have experienced more than me when you go off the top with that sacrificial gift he grows your faith as he provides for your needs time and time and time again it reveals priorities
[time=2723] it develops character it grows faith another thing to keep in mind is that the gift put
[time=2729] aside as I've mentioned should be sacrificial I don't think it should be irresponsible I
[time=2736] think it should be sacrificial and then you say to me well what's the difference how am I supposed to figure out what sacrificial what what what amount will he use to grow faith
[time=2747] and trust in me and what amount would just be silly I mean I would just be being irresponsible with me and my family in my world and my answer to that is I don't know I don't know but I
[time=2762] know he knows and I know he works in and through your heart and if you are genuinely
[time=2768] individually as a couple as a family if you are genuinely open to what that amount might
[time=2775] be and there is a heart in you that wants to have your faith grown and priorities realized and character developed I don't think he'll throw you over the cliff on that one I think
[time=2786] he'll help you in time figure out what that sacrificial amount is look at second Corinthians aid if you would go to the second letter that Paul wrote to the Corinthians I love hearing
[time=2798] Steve Longbreak teach through this passage no one's in my opinion I've never heard it taught better than the way Steve explains this I won't try to duplicate that I want to just read it to you and remind you of what it says on this topic of sacrificial giving
[time=2812] now brethren we wish to make known to you Paul says to the church at Corinth he wants to tell them about the church at Macedonia and he says brethren we wish to make known
[time=2822] to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty look at that in their
[time=2834] great ordeal of affliction so they're being afflicted and then two things come together two things come crashing together on this scene of giving the abundant joy that they
[time=2847] had in affliction and their deep poverty and if you look up that word in the New Testament
[time=2853] in the Greek in the original language if you're trying to figure out what that poverty word really means it when you look it up it really means poverty they were really really poor
[time=2865] and they were in much affliction and they had great joy and when that joy and that poverty came crashing together it overflows in the wealth of their liberality in the wealth of
[time=2878] their gift for I testify that according to their ability and beyond there's the sacrifice
[time=2885] and beyond there's the growing in faith that you've got to figure out with him and beyond
[time=2891] their ability they gave of their own accord look at verse 4 begging us not not oh I hope
[time=2898] he doesn't ask us because we don't have much and I'm not sure how we pull it off no it says they begged him with much urging for the favor of participating in the support of the
[time=2913] saints Bob Purdy told me this in between services check this out he was in a vulnerable just
[time=2920] a few weeks ago if Annabel would be in that Macedonian region today so Bob's in a vulnerable
[time=2929] it's the last day of his teaching week there and he's in a meeting where Vladimir's meeting
[time=2935] with all of the pastors it's separate from the Bob Blackhawk Antioch initiative deal it's a separate meeting they let Bob sit in on and in the meeting as they catch up with each other one of them stands up and with great emotion and in an attempt to restrain himself
[time=2952] he just overflows as he shares with those dear brothers all of them in great poverty
[time=2958] and all of them with great joy this guy shares with the entire group some of what he's going
[time=2964] through back in his village and he's talking about his family and he's talking about the lack of finances and he's talking about something that went wrong over here that made there be even less finance I mean he was just being honest with them and several of the guys right there stopped the meeting and they pray and they take an offering the 25 guys Anatoly those
[time=2991] guys they stop and they they're just trying to find something and they they take an offering
[time=2999] for this dear brother and they pray for him and they lay hands on him and they hug him and they cry and they come alongside a sacrificial amount for some in the room this morning people
[time=3015] will ask me about the tithe you know the 10% figure we connect that often to the Old Testament and the 10% gift in the New Testament we don't see there being so much a direct amount talked
[time=3027] about in the New Testament we hear again and again that it's to be regular that it's to be sacrificial that it's to be from your heart that it's to be a gift borne out of gratitude for what God has done and he leaves it up to you and I have absolutely no problem answering
[time=3041] anybody on that front by saying that the 10% doesn't have to be a neglected thing it can be a great starting point it can be a great gauge for some of you in the room 5% would
[time=3054] utterly stretch your faith and I would suggest starting there for some of you in the room
[time=3061] 10% is a great place 10% for some in the room stretches your understanding of him and the
[time=3069] way in which you spend and the way in which you budget and the way in which you generously exist for some 10% is a good number and you really get stretched on a regular basis for
[time=3082] some of you in the room 10% is absolutely nothing if we're talking about faith stretching sacrifice
[time=3091] for you it could be 15 for you it could be 20 you know what I am so thankful that God left that between you and him I don't want to have anything to do with that I want you
[time=3102] to faithfully think that through remember don't rob him look at what it says in Proverbs 11
[time=3109] Mitchell called me this weekend and pointed this verse out to me these verses and I just couldn't wait to share it with you this morning and I want you to think this through now as we conclude look at this carefully this is this capture so much of what we've been saying
[time=3124] these last few weeks look at Proverbs 11 24 there is one who scatters stop right there there is one who lives his life there there are people who approach the everyday of their life and they scatter themselves they give generously and graciously they give of their time and their talent and their treasure they they scatter they don't hold onto it they let
[time=3145] it go and look what it says there is one who scatters and yet increases all the more and there is one who withholds there are some who hang on really tight they don't want to scatter
[time=3156] because they think if they scatter they won't have enough and so they withhold and look what it says there is one who withholds what is justly do and yet it results only in want
[time=3166] they just end up needing one more verse 25 I love this the generous man there it is it's
[time=3177] what we've been talking about the generous man will be what say it and he who waters will
[time=3184] himself be watered amen you know what I think God's up to something here in our midst my
[time=3192] friends I want to tell you at the end of the year I'm so thankful from Thanksgiving to December 31 the elders are working on a project that we want to bring to you at end of the
[time=3202] year giving opportunity and above and beyond gift that's going to go toward the some of
[time=3208] the needs that exist at Blackhawk but the cool thing about it is that we've selected a great church called the mission church it's a church that's housed at the rescue mission downtown
[time=3221] and it is just filled with some people who have just enormous and very unique needs and there's a couple down there that I know he's the pastor and she helps out and they are giving their lives to this small band of people with unbelievable needs and they desire to
[time=3236] see the the cycle of poverty and addiction broken and we want to take at the end of the
[time=3242] year we want to take a decent size percentage of our year in gift and gift that church not
[time=3248] only with those funds but then begin to at the onset of the calendar year give you opportunities
[time=3255] to go and to be with them to go and to serve them to go and encourage them while you continue to do things like neighbor link as you meet the real needs and serving opportunities through neighbor link we want to give you a chance in January to go to Biloxi I told you about that a few weeks ago there's gonna be a chance for for 20 of you to go if you want to hope
[time=3275] city down in Biloxi where we can continue to come alongside people whose lives and homes are being rebuilt there's so much that God is up to I just found out last week I may in fact be going to Uganda in January and a chance to be there at a pastor's conference with
[time=3291] over 400 pastors who come from villages and communities where AIDS is taking its toll and poverty is through the ceiling he's up to some really really really exciting things
[time=3302] and I'm inviting you to participate to respond generously let me ask if you would to close
[time=3309] your eyes and bow your heads there's a card before you close your eyes grab that response
[time=3315] card out of your bulletin if you would and we're a little short on time but I'm just gonna ask you to just take a minute this morning if you can if you can't I'll ask you to bring it back next week but please this morning would you just take a moment if you can and just read through that response card this is just an opportunity for you to kind of take a pen and your thoughts and what God's doing in your heart and with this card let us know what God did and is doing in you through these last four weeks I'll give you the chance just
[time=3343] to read through there I won't read it out loud but I want you to look through that response card give us your comments down on the bottom help us know and help us hear what God is
[time=3353] up to in your heart and life and as you carefully read through that card and as you give some thought to the way in which you'll respond if you have any questions about Biloxi if you have questions about neighbor link if you have questions about helping serve and meet the needs of the poor if you have questions about children's ministry classes that still need help please write that down and let me if I can just ask you to bow your heads and
[time=3379] close your eyes now if you would with your eyes closed let me just say this to there are some in the room I believe who would want to be generous but you've not yet experienced
[time=3391] the generous love of God you've not yet come to that point in time where you've put that
[time=3398] stake in the ground and drawn that line of faith in the sand and said God I want to follow you I want to give you all of my life and I want to just give you a chance this morning
[time=3410] to just pray a very sometimes we say a very simple prayer I think it's a very profound prayer words from your heart toward God like this and you could just repeat this in the
[time=3421] quietness of your heart and he'll hear you and he'll redeem you he will bring salvation
[time=3428] and new life and new hope and new purpose into the everyday of your heart and life if you'll
[time=3436] confess to him this Father God just quietly if you'll just say this Father God I know that
[time=3444] my sin separates me from you Father God I know that my sin and my failure leaves me lost
[time=3454] and separated from eternal life with you and life with meaning today oh Father God I confess
[time=3463] my sin and I accept the gift of your son Jesus Christ I fully surrender my heart and life
[time=3470] to you and I know that my sin is forgiven because of what Christ did for me on the cross
[time=3478] just say thank you to him from deep within you for that saving sacrifice he hears you
[time=3486] and commit to him now say Father God I commit to live each and every day fully surrendered
[time=3492] to you and God I commit to do whatever I need to do with those here that will love and help me I will do whatever I need to do to faithfully and genuinely follow you Father God we know
[time=3506] there are some in the room who have confessed and communicated those words to you thank you
[time=3512] for the salvation that you bring thank you for the relationship that you offer and thank you for the chance to be generous we thank you for all that you're doing and pray you would continue to do this work in us as we give as we respond with generosity here in
[time=3527] the plate and beyond these four walls in your son's name we pray amen.
