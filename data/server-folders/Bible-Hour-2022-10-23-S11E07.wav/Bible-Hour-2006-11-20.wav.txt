[time=60] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=68] and on earth."
[time=75] Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=90] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=96] end of the age.
[time=101] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=110] In the solitary moment of his birth, on his perin dusty land.
[time=138] All of heaven kissed the face of the earth when I'm here a call of love.
[time=152] God became a man, but he was sent away to draw his final breath when he was only 33.
[time=167] And in the shame of dying a criminal's death.
[time=175] He cleansed an angry world, and in his suffering I see the glory of the love.
[time=189] The beauty of the body that was broken for I forgive that the glory of his perfect love
[time=203] is the heart of the story, the glory of the love.
[time=217] I've tried to find salvation on my own in a search for something real, but there's a guilty
[time=232] heart.
[time=234] Oh, inside this flesh and bone I fall upon his grace and I begin to feel that the glory
[time=246] of the blood.
[time=251] The beauty of the body that was broken for I forgive that the glory of his perfect love
[time=264] is the heart of the story, the glory of the love.
[time=275] And when I close my eyes I can see him hanging there.
[time=283] The precious broken land of God.
[time=290] And all the majesty in this world could not compare to the glory.
[time=303] The beauty of the body that was broken for I forgive that the glory of the love.
[time=332] His heart of the story, the glory of the blood.
[time=350] When he was sent away to draw his final breath, when he was only hurt and free.
[time=380] I forgive because you were forsaken, I'm accepted, you are condemned.
[time=428] I'm alive and well, your spirit is within me because you died and rose again.
[time=442] Amazing love, how can it be, to my King would die for me.
[time=457] Amazing love, I know it's true, it's my joy, it's my view, it's all my view, I honor you.
[time=475] I'm forgiven because you were forsaken, I'm accepted, you were condemned, I'm alive and well, your spirit is within me
[time=501] because you died and rose again.
[time=506] Oh, sing it out, amazing love.
[time=509] Amazing love, how can it be, to my King would die for me.
[time=523] Amazing love, I know it's true, it's my joy, it's all my love.
[time=533] Oh, let's sing that again.
[time=536] Amazing love, how can it be, to my King would die for me.
[time=551] Amazing love, my know it's true, it's my joy, it's all my view, it's all my view, I honor you.
[time=572] You are my King.
[time=586] Let's hear just the voices.
[time=594] Amazing love, amazing love, amazing love, amazing love, amazing love, amazing love, amazing love, amazing love, amazing love.
[time=615] Amazing love, amazing love, amazing love, amazing love.
[time=636] Amazing love, how can it be, to my King would die for me.
[time=659] Amazing love, I know it's true.
[time=665] It's my joy, it's all my view.
[time=669] One more time, amazing love.
[time=672] Amazing love, how can it be, to my King would die for me.
[time=686] Amazing love, I know it's true, it's my joy, it's all my view, it's all my view.
[time=715] Let me just say this to you, before we sing this last song, there may be some of you in the room who just would really benefit this morning.
[time=723] I don't know the specifics, wouldn't understand maybe the particulars, but you may just really benefit from having somebody pray with you.
[time=732] There may be something you're facing today, there may be something coming up this week, you may just be moved this morning with a great sense of gratitude for this great thing that he's done
[time=744] and saving you.
[time=745] So I'm just going to ask the guys who were down here to just stand if they would.
[time=749] Steve and I are over here and there may be a few others over on this side from our team that could come down and it should be just like someone to pray with you briefly.
[time=757] As we sing this last song, just make your way down, just let us pray for you.
[time=761] We're so thankful for you.
[time=763] We want to stand with you and do our best to support you.
[time=766] And let's pray together if we can, let's sing this last song with all our hearts.
[time=796] And let's pray together if we can, let's pray together if we can, let's pray together if we can.
[time=839] My Jesus, Jesus down.
[time=856] I love thee, God, as thou hast perst love in me.
[time=869] And purchase thy heart on Calvary's tree.
[time=883] I love thee for bearing the thorns on my ground.
[time=898] If ever I love thee, my Jesus, Jesus down.
[time=916] The mansions of glory and endless divine.
[time=936] I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright.
[time=950] I'll sing with a lingering ground on my ground.
[time=965] If ever I love thee, my Jesus, Jesus down.
[time=980] Before the throne of God above, I have a strong and perfect plea.
[time=996] A great high priest whose name is love.
[time=1002] Whoever lives and pleads for me.
[time=1007] My name is great and on his hands.
[time=1012] My name is written on his hand.
[time=1023] No tongue can be his deep heart.
[time=1042] Friendsage intends me to despair and tells me of the guilt within.
[time=1053] A word I look and see in there who ate and into all my sin.
[time=1064] As a sinless Savior died, my sinful soul is counted free.
[time=1073] For God the just is satisfied.
[time=1078] To look on him and pardon me.
[time=1090] Behold in land the risen lamb.
[time=1095] My perfect spotless righteousness.
[time=1100] The great on change of all I am.
[time=1105] The king of glory and of grace.
[time=1110] One with himself I cannot die.
[time=1115] My soul is purchased by his love.
[time=1120] My life is lived with Christ on high.
[time=1125] With Christ my Savior and my God.
[time=1137] One with himself I cannot die.
[time=1142] My soul is purchased by his love.
[time=1147] My life is lived with Christ on high.
[time=1152] With Christ my Savior and my God.
[time=1182] Thank you Corbin and choir what a great great song and what a great truth.
[time=1187] It's good to be together again.
[time=1190] It's so good to see you my friends and I just want to tell you again how encouraging it's been.
[time=1195] I've told you that the last several weeks but I just got to tell you again the new emails and the new letters.
[time=1201] The new hallway conversations just this week.
[time=1204] The stories that continue to come in as we see the family of God here at Blackhawk.
[time=1209] Responding to these last four or five weeks of our series and our study and our discussion about what it means to live generously.
[time=1218] From what I hear and from what we sense God is doing a great work in you and in us.
[time=1224] And for that we are really really thankful.
[time=1227] I was just amazed this week to hear about different things.
[time=1231] I've heard generosity stories on a number of fronts.
[time=1235] I'm so thankful that as it relates to Christmas with Blackhawk and for instance this card idea we gave you this morning.
[time=1242] I'm hearing about people who want to make CWB a generous gift on their part to those in their neighborhood.
[time=1249] Those in their family.
[time=1250] Those in the workplace.
[time=1251] It's so great to hear about.
[time=1253] I heard about a family this week who have invited five others to join them and their family for a huge night
[time=1260] with a meal and a concert and an opportunity to share with these other families on their block the greatest story ever told.
[time=1268] I really hope and I am really praying for each and every one of us that you would give some thought to who it is you could share that gift with generously.
[time=1277] So much work is being done and there are so many preparations and our hope is that you would as an individual.
[time=1283] That you would as a family that you would as a group.
[time=1286] However it works that you would give some thought to the generosity that you can extend with an invitation to CWB on that weekend in December.
[time=1295] I was so encouraged to hear about a number of small groups that got together this week to celebrate what God was doing.
[time=1302] They had committed as groups to fast that day prior to meeting and with the money that they would have spent on food that day.
[time=1312] They committed to give that money and whatever else God put on their heart that day toward the needs of those who were poor and hungry.
[time=1322] They committed the first, they were hoping to raise 500, they committed the first 500 dollars to the vine here at Blackhawk
[time=1331] to the ministry that we have to meet the physical needs of real people in this place.
[time=1336] They committed the first 500 hoping they would raise that much and as they came that night having fasted and prayed, 30 of them
[time=1345] and as they gave they raised somewhere in the neighborhood of $1,200, 500 of which goes to the vine and the other balance went to the needy and the poor globally.
[time=1357] I hear stories like that and I'm so thankful that we're even thinking in that direction much less willing to give ourselves to that kind of endeavor.
[time=1366] I was so thankful last Sunday. I was so thankful for you, for this family and what we saw transpire as I brought to you.
[time=1375] And I wasn't even really initially planning on it. I had just mentioned first hour that our new Russian missionary pastor family, Anatoly and Enya.
[time=1386] Remember them? I think we've got their picture for you again this morning.
[time=1389] I had told you about Anatoly and Enya, our new family that we're trying to love and come alongside and they're two girls over there in Russia as they begin this new ministry.
[time=1399] I mentioned that there was a $2,000 mortgage on this apartment and I showed you last week this apartment.
[time=1407] I showed you the restroom and I showed you the bathing area and I showed you their living quarters and I reminded you of how grateful they were for what seemed to so many of us to be so little, but to them it's so much.
[time=1422] And I just mentioned that possibly there might be a way that we could as a family respond.
[time=1428] Well, following first hour and following second hour, you did.
[time=1432] I walked to my car at the conclusion of the day last Sunday with almost $3,000 in my pocket.
[time=1441] And I can't begin to tell you how meaningful it was to watch little kids pulling quarters out of their pockets.
[time=1452] To see fourth and fifth graders handing over what I knew was a precious $5 bill to see moms rifling through their purses trying to find a 10 spot to see senior adults writing checks for $20.
[time=1468] To see others of you giving graciously in incredible ways.
[time=1473] I believe if I'm not mistaken that accounts now grown to almost $5,000, their mortgage is going to be paid off.
[time=1480] Amen? Amen. Amen.
[time=1483] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1487] And we get the chance to then put the balance of that into an account that will be there for them in times of need and opportunity in the days to come.
[time=1495] And as I think about all of this, my friends, my mind and my heart, they continue to just give thought to,
[time=1502] and my mind and my heart continue to just be drawn to this great truth that we find in the scriptures about how very important it is,
[time=1511] how critical it is that you and I would as it relates to our resources, whatever that might look like.
[time=1518] My mind and my heart continue to be drawn back to the scriptures and all that they have to say about the way you and I would approach our resources.
[time=1528] As I read the emails, as I listen to the stories, as I give thought to this issue of generosity and finances,
[time=1535] I'm reminded of what it is that rests at the very heart, oftentimes, of your struggle and mine, then I'll be honest here.
[time=1546] It is my struggle at times. It is a struggle that I've faced for years. It's a struggle that I feel like at times gets better.
[time=1553] It's a struggle that at times I feel like I'm losing ground on. In all honesty, it's a struggle that I'm continuing to ask God for help on.
[time=1562] And I speak for you, and I know I speak for me when I say it's a struggle that all of us face at times as it relates to our money and the struggle, my friends, is this.
[time=1573] There are times when we fall in love with money.
[time=1583] There are times when we fall in love with the thought of money. There are times when we fall in love with the pursuit of money.
[time=1592] And it's almost like a childhood romance. It's almost like, you know, a first love. We can begin to actually crave it.
[time=1600] We begin to make sacrifices. We shouldn't make for it. We get consumed with the thought of it.
[time=1607] And I've seen people who make $15,000 a year and I've seen people who make $500,000 a year. It almost doesn't matter.
[time=1615] It doesn't matter what part of the socio-economic ladder you're on. I've just seen people utterly gripped by the pursuit of it.
[time=1625] And this love for what they believe in their hearts it will bring.
[time=1631] We begin to love money. And what do the Scriptures teach us about this?
[time=1636] What does it say? Some think that it says, some think that what the Bible communicates is that money is the root of all evil.
[time=1645] Is that what the Scriptures teach? No, the Scriptures teach in 1 Timothy 6, 10, that the what?
[time=1652] That the love. Look at that verse. And it's always good to read the whole verse.
[time=1656] For the love, look at that, of money, is a root of all sorts of evil, varied evil, all kinds of evil.
[time=1668] All expressions of evil. I mean, it's varied.
[time=1672] For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil and some of you and me at times and others that we know.
[time=1680] Some, Paul says, as he writes to Timothy, and some by longing for it, there's that love.
[time=1686] By longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
[time=1695] Maybe you know somebody who has been pierced with many griefs because of their wandering love of money.
[time=1706] Maybe you yourself have experienced at times those piercings, that pain, that struggle that comes when that whole thing just got out of whack.
[time=1716] In your heart and in your life and in your soul.
[time=1720] And what I want to show you this morning in the Scriptures is a passage where Jesus himself, where Jesus himself teaches us how not to love money.
[time=1735] He gathers all these folks on the side of a mountain.
[time=1739] It's called the Sermon on the Mount. It's in Matthew 5, 6 and 7.
[time=1743] And I want to just draw your attention this morning if I can to Matthew chapter 6.
[time=1747] Would you open your Bibles and would you turn to Matthew chapter 6?
[time=1751] And we're going to read this morning verses 19 to 24.
[time=1755] What does Jesus have to say to you and me this morning as it relates to our love of money, our pursuit of wealth?
[time=1764] He has some very, very good things to say that I hope each and every one of you in the room this morning, those of you watching on the broadcast, those of you listening online.
[time=1774] My hope and my prayer is that whoever you are, whatever you make, whatever your bottom line is, it doesn't matter.
[time=1781] We discovered four weeks ago in our study that we're all rich.
[time=1784] If you've got change in your ashtray, if you can buy a Coke on the way home today.
[time=1789] If you've got any money at all on an account, you are rich.
[time=1794] And my hope is that you would open your heart and mind and soul to what Jesus himself had to say about this issue.
[time=1802] Stand, would you in honor of God's Word?
[time=1804] And let me read this for you Matthew 6 verses 19 to 24.
[time=1808] Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
[time=1817] But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in or steal.
[time=1825] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=1830] The eye is the lamp of the body.
[time=1833] So then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light, generous.
[time=1840] But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness, greedy.
[time=1846] If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness?
[time=1852] No one, it says there, no one.
[time=1856] Doesn't matter who you are, doesn't matter where you come from, doesn't matter how much you know, doesn't matter what you intend.
[time=1861] No one can serve two masters.
[time=1865] For either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to one and despise the other.
[time=1871] You cannot serve God, serve God and wealth.
[time=1878] Father, we humbly come before you again this morning asking for the insight and wisdom that only you and your spirit and your word can bring.
[time=1887] All of us in the room, as we continue to live life in this culture, in this day.
[time=1893] All of us in the room that would desire to do that in a way that would bring great glory to you.
[time=1898] God need to understand these truths.
[time=1901] We're faced with it constantly, which way to go, what to value, how to conduct ourselves as it relates with that which you have provided us.
[time=1912] And so God, as we listen here to the words of your Son, and as we take in this great truth, we pray as always that you would remind and convict,
[time=1921] that you would bring new learnings, God, that you would change us to be people willing to steward that which you've given us in a way that would make much of you and be a blessing to others.
[time=1932] And we pray this in your Son's name, amen.
[time=1936] You see in our humanness, we have an innate drive to accumulate, don't we?
[time=1943] There is just something in us that wants to accumulate.
[time=1948] Just look at your wife's closet. No, I'm just kidding.
[time=1953] There is something in us as human beings where we just have this drive, this movement in our soul to possess and to enjoy and to be prosperous and to have more.
[time=1965] We're always wanting more.
[time=1968] Most of Western and modern day culture is about lives built around possessions.
[time=1973] Think about it.
[time=1974] It's always about what you have. It's always about lives built around what you drive, lives built around where you live, lives built around where you travel.
[time=1983] It seems to be again and again and again and again about possessions and what we accumulate and what we have.
[time=1989] We can become fixated on wealth rather than God.
[time=1995] Instead of fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, as it talks about there in Hebrews 12, we can fix our hearts or maybe better set our affections on stuff.
[time=2011] And in the process, we miss out on the life.
[time=2015] And I want to point this out to you because I'm going to take you to a scripture here in just a moment that says it so wonderfully, says it so powerfully, the life.
[time=2024] The oftentimes, the stuff.
[time=2026] And oftentimes, the accumulation of the stuff.
[time=2029] And oftentimes, the big bottom line is about a life that we long to live.
[time=2035] A lifestyle that we long to have.
[time=2038] A way of living that we believe will bring some kind of meaning or significance.
[time=2044] But I want to show this to you.
[time=2046] This is such a powerful passage.
[time=2048] And it's as if Paul knew exactly what Jesus had said and obviously Paul did know and was very aware of what Jesus had said.
[time=2057] You'll recognize the phraseology.
[time=2059] You'll understand the similarity.
[time=2061] Go to 1 Timothy 6 verses 17, 18 and 19.
[time=2066] Boy, this has said so well.
[time=2068] Paul addresses it here with Timothy, this young pastor who's trying to do his best to minister and speak what's true into the hearts and lives of those in his church.
[time=2077] And Paul says instruct those, verse 17, instruct those who are rich.
[time=2083] Remember, that's you.
[time=2085] And that's me.
[time=2087] Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2097] Raise your hand this morning if you've seen first hand or you know someone who has experienced the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2106] Absolutely.
[time=2108] Instruct them not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2113] But on God, fix their hope on God who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.
[time=2120] Don't forget that all that he supplies.
[time=2122] He means for you and I to be able to enjoy.
[time=2125] Instruct them to do good.
[time=2127] Don't be conceited.
[time=2129] Don't fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2132] But verse 18, do good.
[time=2135] Be rich, he says, in good works.
[time=2138] To be generous, there's our word.
[time=2140] To be generous and ready to share, storing up for themselves.
[time=2145] Sound familiar?
[time=2146] Storing up for themselves.
[time=2147] The treasure of a good foundation for the future so that they may take hold.
[time=2153] Here it is.
[time=2154] So that they may take hold of that, which is what?
[time=2157] Say it.
[time=2158] Life indeed.
[time=2160] You want to live life.
[time=2165] You want life that's really life.
[time=2168] I mean you want to live the way God designed you to live.
[time=2171] You want to experience the fullness and the satisfaction and the gratification of a life
[time=2178] that's really life.
[time=2181] Then do good with your wealth.
[time=2184] Be rich in good works.
[time=2187] Be generous with your wealth.
[time=2189] Ready to share your wealth.
[time=2191] Storing up for themselves.
[time=2193] The treasure of a good foundation with your wealth so that they may.
[time=2197] Those of you who have done that with your wealth take hold of that, which is life indeed.
[time=2205] You want to stop fixating on money?
[time=2208] You want to stop loving the cash?
[time=2211] You want to start really living life the way God intended you to live and experience life.
[time=2216] Jesus says three things.
[time=2218] Back to Matthew 6, 19 to 24.
[time=2221] Three things.
[time=2222] We'll look at one of them this morning.
[time=2225] You got to be committed to the right account.
[time=2229] Three things.
[time=2230] Matthew 6 verses 19 to 24.
[time=2233] You have got to be committed, my friend, to the right account.
[time=2237] You've got options.
[time=2238] There are account options today.
[time=2242] You and I have got to be, Jesus says, committed to the right account.
[time=2246] You've got to be committed to the right vision or perspective later on there in those verses.
[time=2252] Then lastly, you've got to be committed to the right master.
[time=2257] I want you to look with me if you will at verse 19.
[time=2260] Let's look at that first one.
[time=2261] We've got to be committed to the right account if you and I are going to be people who don't love money but instead love the one who gives the money, it says, do not store up for yourselves.
[time=2273] You see it there?
[time=2274] Don't store up for yourselves treasures on earth.
[time=2277] You can stop right there.
[time=2279] In the Greek, that word literally means treasury.
[time=2282] Our first point could be be committed to the right treasury account.
[time=2287] Same thing.
[time=2288] Don't lay up for yourselves treasures in a treasury on earth.
[time=2293] Every person in this room, spiritually speaking, has to make a decision on this issue.
[time=2299] With your resources, with your time and your talent and your treasure, you will be one way or the other.
[time=2305] You will be passionate and devoted to an earthly account or a heavenly account.
[time=2312] Earthly or a heavenly treasure.
[time=2314] And what Jesus says here is stay away from.
[time=2317] In the Greek, it literally means where it says, do not store up.
[time=2320] It literally means to stockpile.
[time=2322] It means to accumulate.
[time=2324] Jesus says, stay away from storing up.
[time=2326] Stay away from a passionate devotion to stockpiling and hoarding wealth.
[time=2331] Here, don't lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth.
[time=2335] Should you pay your bills?
[time=2336] Yes or no?
[time=2337] Answer.
[time=2338] Yes.
[time=2339] Should you save a little bit for college if you can?
[time=2341] Yes or no?
[time=2342] Answer.
[time=2343] Should you buy food for your kids?
[time=2344] Pay your mortgage to keep a roof overhead?
[time=2347] Yeah.
[time=2351] He wants you to do that.
[time=2353] But pass those things.
[time=2356] The daily, realistic provision for those that you're responsible for.
[time=2361] He says, hold the rest loosely.
[time=2366] Deuteronomy 15, Mitch talked to you about it a few weeks ago, don't white knuckle.
[time=2370] Don't white knuckle that stuff.
[time=2372] He says, hold on to it loosely.
[time=2374] Exercise wisdom.
[time=2376] Be generous.
[time=2377] Remember, God isn't against wealth.
[time=2380] Understand that, right?
[time=2382] God is not against wealth.
[time=2385] God provides wealth.
[time=2387] Deuteronomy 8, we looked at that.
[time=2389] It's God Himself who provides, all of us are wealthy today.
[time=2394] There are some in the room and there are some in this family and there are some of you watching this morning.
[time=2399] You are abundantly wealthy.
[time=2401] You've got a lot of change in your ashtray.
[time=2405] You could buy a few cokes on the way home.
[time=2408] I mean, there are some who God has for God's reasons.
[time=2412] In God's time, in God's place, there are some who make a great deal of money.
[time=2418] And God reminds those individuals, in Deuteronomy 8, don't you ever forget.
[time=2423] I gave you all that.
[time=2426] I made all of that possible.
[time=2428] And I made all that possible for a reason.
[time=2430] See, God isn't against wealth.
[time=2432] God is against what?
[time=2434] Greedy.
[time=2436] God is against those who take what He has given so freely and hold on to it so tightly.
[time=2442] It's not against wealth.
[time=2444] 1 Timothy 6, the passage I just read.
[time=2447] It didn't say instruct those who are wealthy to get rid of all their wealth, did it?
[time=2452] It said instruct those who are wealthy not to be conceited, to be generous,
[time=2458] to be kind, to give it away where needed for purposeful kingdom reasons.
[time=2464] Anything that you and I hold on to, don't forget this, anything wealth, any gift He gives,
[time=2470] anything good bestowed on you by God, anything that you and I hold on to too tightly.
[time=2476] In other words, anything that you and I aren't willing to let go of can easily become a God.
[time=2484] Can easily become an idol. Can easily become a little gee God that you and I can if we're not careful begin to worship instead of being willing to freely give it away.
[time=2495] Abraham, unspeakably wealthy in the Old Testament, Job.
[time=2500] Most of you know the story of Job, who had a great deal, was one of the wealthiest men around.
[time=2505] And God allows these unbelievable trials and difficulties to come Job's way as the enemy
[time=2511] tends to try and move Job away from his faith.
[time=2514] And most of you who know the story know that as Job endures all of that.
[time=2518] And as we come to the end of that story, God in His great blessing and love for Job brings him all that he had before and more, makes him even more wealthy than he was when he started.
[time=2530] God isn't against wealth, God's against greed. Proverbs 14, 23 says that in all labor there is
[time=2537] profit and Jesus again and again in the Gospels makes a huge deal about the ant who works really hard
[time=2545] to gather all that stuff so that he can provide profit and wealth can bring great honor to God
[time=2553] when invested properly.
[time=2556] I know people, I've had friends over the years, I know I've been very close to individuals
[time=2562] who have made and realized an unspeakable amount of money.
[time=2567] And I have seen both sides of that picture.
[time=2571] I know people who in their pursuit of it and in their acquiring of it have utterly ruined their lives.
[time=2581] They have shattered their families. They have destroyed their reputation.
[time=2587] They have aged in years. They have suffered the humiliation of what comes.
[time=2594] And I know others who have received and worked hard for and invested and have in the end come up
[time=2600] with a great deal of money and you would never know it because of the humility that reigns in their
[time=2606] heart because of the generosity with which they live because of the way in which they conduct themselves as they continue to be fixed on that which is meaningful and important and they see all of
[time=2618] the other stuff as simply a means by which they can share God's grace and His love and His provision.
[time=2624] You know I think the key word in the text, just go back to verse 19.
[time=2628] I know it might be obvious to some but just underline this.
[time=2631] Verse 19, you know what the most important word there I think is?
[time=2635] Do not store up for who, for yourself. It's not about you, is it?
[time=2645] It's just not about you and me, is it? It's just not about us. It's about Him and it's about others.
[time=2654] Jesus says no. Jesus says no to the earthly account.
[time=2659] Jesus says make an eternal investment. Be committed to the right account.
[time=2665] And what's the right account? Well He shows it to you right there in verse 20.
[time=2669] Store up, it says, but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust
[time=2676] destroys and where thieves do not break in or steal.
[time=2680] My friends, whether it's money, tithes and offerings, five dollars from a fourth grader for Anatoly
[time=2688] and Anya, year in gifts, whatever it might be.
[time=2691] When our resources are given lovingly and sacrificially and generously toward kingdom endeavors,
[time=2699] towards that which is trying to make a difference eternally in the lives of people, whatever that might look like.
[time=2706] It could be Anatoly and Anya. It could be a third grade class meeting right now
[time=2713] where truth is being spoken into the hearts and lives of those that need it desperately.
[time=2718] It could be student ministry here at Blackhawk. It could be the opportunities we have with the love church.
[time=2724] It could be in Biloxi in January. Wherever we go, wherever the church goes,
[time=2731] to fulfill that great opportunity that God gave us, to love Him and to love others.
[time=2738] When we give towards that generously, I want to show you two things here from the text.
[time=2747] Two things happen. Number one, and this is just maybe just a point of interest for some,
[time=2753] this whole moth, rust, thieves thing.
[time=2758] He didn't just, you may be kind of thinking, where'd that come from?
[time=2762] I just, I want to remind you that in that day, in first century Jerusalem and in that country there,
[time=2769] and as Jesus would speak to those people, you have to understand that in that day there were three ways in which wealth would show itself.
[time=2778] Wealth would show itself in three ways in that culture. Number one, it was the garment that you wore.
[time=2784] The garment that you wore in that day said a lot about who you were and how much you had.
[time=2791] Sound familiar? The garment was very, very important.
[time=2795] If you had a certain kind of garment, it meant you had financially and socially arrived,
[time=2801] and folks would wear that garment with pride, but the problem with garments is you put them in a closet
[time=2807] and close the door in what comes and gets them. Mause. Gone.
[time=2814] Rust. What was he talking about with rust? Well, a second form of wealth in that culture was precious metal.
[time=2822] Folks would be the possessors of and they would gain ownership of precious metals, but if you didn't take care of the precious metals just right, soon they would what?
[time=2832] Rust. And sometimes they wouldn't invest their cash in garments or precious metals.
[time=2838] Sometimes they would literally just take their money and go out in the backyard and dig a hole.
[time=2843] And they'd bury their money in the ground.
[time=2846] And guess who would watch from behind the bushes? Guess who would be eavesdropping from behind the trees?
[time=2853] Thieves. Who, when they would leave, would break in and steal.
[time=2860] He says, "When you invest generously in that which matters,
[time=2866] moth can't touch it. Rust won't get to it. Thieves can't break in and steal."
[time=2872] And secondly, he says, "When you give lovingly and when you give generously." He stores up, the passage says, that what gets stored up are these things called treasures in heaven.
[time=2885] And I want to ask you this morning, many of you in the room like me have been around church for years.
[time=2889] Others of you, it's a newer journey, but there may be a bunch of us in the room who, when you hear the phrase, treasures in heaven.
[time=2898] Maybe you're not quite, some of you might be, but others might not be quite sure what that really means.
[time=2905] What does it mean that we're storing up treasures in heaven? What are treasures in heaven?
[time=2913] I'm asking you, don't answer out loud, but I want you to think about that.
[time=2916] What does that really mean? Treasures in heaven get stored up when you and I make an eternal investment with our resources.
[time=2927] Let me answer this for you by just taking you to the Scriptures.
[time=2931] Go to Luke 16. I find this fascinating.
[time=2935] I'm so thankful that there was a time when someone finally pointed this out toward me, and there are other places we can go to answer the question, but I just want you to see this. Watch this.
[time=2945] This is amazing. This is in Luke 16 where he's talking about the unrighteous steward.
[time=2950] This guy had some issues when it came to money, and he says in verse 9, he says, and I say to you, Jesus speaking here, he says, and I say to you, now listen, he says, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness
[time=2966] so that when it fails, the wealth, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings.
[time=2980] Do you get that? Do you see what that's saying?
[time=2986] I want you to look at that again. This is really, really fascinating.
[time=2990] It's powerful. Treasures in heaven, my friend, are people.
[time=2996] When you invest, watch this, when you invest graciously in kingdom stuff,
[time=3004] when you invest in Anatoly and Inya. Here's, watch, watch. Anatoly and Inya,
[time=3010] they go downstairs from their apartment one day, and in their effort to build redemptive relationships with those in this city of 250,000 people where there aren't
[time=3020] any believers and there aren't any churches, but they, they befriend, let's say, a gal who sells bread on the corner. And in that relationship, in that redemptive
[time=3030] relationship that they build with the gal who sells bread on the corner, Anatoly and Inya, in a matter of months, seek God in a mighty way, bring that gal to faith in Christ. Maybe she's the first person, the first
[time=3044] member of their new church.
[time=3048] When, when that gal someday gets to heaven, I believe what this passage is clearly teaching, when the third grader today who you invested in, when you put that money in the offering plate and that third grader heard the truth and, and bowed the knee of his or her heart and accepted Christ fully surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3069] When a student, in student ministries, when a family gets blessed and Biloxi in January, when people are impacted forever
[time=3079] through the investment that God allows us to make, I believe this passage says there comes a day when they receive you, when you are in heaven and that bread lady that Anatoly and Inya saw come to faith comes to you and says thank you.
[time=3096] Thank you for your generous investment in the kingdom.
[time=3100] I'm here because of what you were willing to give, obviously here because of the sacrifice of Christ, obviously here because of the providence of God, but thank you for your faithful participation.
[time=3112] Money in and of itself isn't unrighteous.
[time=3116] Back to the text, money's money, but when it fails, when it's all said and done, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings. If we invest generously in the right account, if we give toward the welfare of human souls, the people who are saved or blessed because of your generosity will someday greet you in heaven with thanksgiving, and I want you to look at verse 21. Back to Matthew 6.
[time=3144] You've got to have the right account and he finishes up that thought. Don't store up for yourselves treasures on earth, verse 19, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, verse 20, for where verse 21, for where your treasure is there your heart will be also.
[time=3164] I want you to catch this this morning, I just want you as we kind of come to the conclusion of these three verses. I want you to write this down somewhere. I want you to store this and not the back, but the front of your mind. I want you to be mindful of this truth this morning, my friends. The two can never be separated. They are inseparable. Your heart and your treasure.
[time=3184] That's what the scriptures are saying. Heart and treasure, inseparable.
[time=3188] Both will be fixed on earth and stuff and trips and cars and square footage or both will be fixed on people, ministry and eternity.
[time=3200] And you don't set your, and you don't set your heart the passage isn't saying that you set your heart on good God honoring stuff so that treasures will follow. The passage is saying wherever your, wherever your treasure is that's where your heart is.
[time=3216] It's just a reality. One of the truest, most accurate, spiritual indicators. People ask me all the time, what could I do?
[time=3224] What could I read? How could I assess the spiritual health of my faith in Christ? And there are several places I could send you, but one would be, and I think probably the most powerful one would be your finances. The way in which you view and handle money. The way in which you invest. The account that you are obsessed with says so very much about your faith. You cannot have one here and the other there. Heart can't be here and treasure pursuit over here.
[time=3260] They will always be together.
[time=3264] The location of your account where your treasure is aimed says everything about your heart. And my hope and my prayer this morning is that you would be, that I would be, and I told you up front I still struggle with this. My hope is that we would be people who could more so day after day after day be a people utterly devoted and in love with God.
[time=3288] Utterly committed to and in love with the God who gives.
[time=3292] Not utterly devoted to and in love with what he gives.
[time=3296] The wealth, the money, the resources. No. In love with and devoted to him.
[time=3300] Willing then to take what he gives. Whether that's 150,000 a year. Whether that's 15,000 a year.
[time=3308] Whether that's a few nickels in that ashtray or a few dollar bills.
[time=3312] Either way, people willing to hold it loosely give it freely, invest it spiritually into the lives of people.
[time=3324] So that someday, someday we can meet these treasures in heaven that he gave us the privilege of investing in.
[time=3332] Hey I want to thank you for your response last week and your bullet in this morning there's a card again if you pull that out. Many of you turned them in others of you didn't get the chance to do that and I want to just encourage you to do this this morning. Would you just please give some thought as you look at that card that first box there talks about generous opportunities to be involved in ministries. If there are any ministries inside please look at the card with me if you would. Any ministries inside these four walls, children's ministry, student ministries, tech, Bible hour ministry, anything at all that sparks an interest in you we'd love to help you get connected in your attempt to, as that box says, be more generous with your time and talent by exploring how you can serve. That next box talks about your generosity with time and talent and the opportunity to serve outside or our four walls. That might be Biloxi and the chance to go down in January. You're going to hear a lot more about that next week. That could be neighbor link which is a monthly opportunity for you to join others from here and others in the church of Fort Wayne who are serving the real needs of real people in our community. If there's a moving in your heart if there's a specific ministry outside or four walls that you'd like to explore with us please write that down and then financially I was so encouraged to read what so many of you wrote last week. People willing to begin supporting what it's doing here. Others already committed to that now willing as they've thought about generous living and what God has been teaching us over these weeks now ready to do more and your comments are much appreciated. Whatever they might be, whatever insights you'd have for us however God has worked, whatever you've learned, however you've been encouraged please write your comments down. I'm going to ask the guys if they would just bring down some offering plates. They'll place the plates down here on the front of the stage and I'll just please if you would take a moment before you leave and fill out these cards let us know what's on your heart, how God has been moving and thank you again. Thank you for being such a generous family. I am so thankful to see what God is doing so very grateful to see him at work in your heart.
[time=3468] Love him my friends. Don't love the money and do your very best to be generous with whatever he's given. Would you stand and can we pray together and would you just take a moment before you leave and drop off the cards and the plate and we'll see you again soon. Father God thank you for this time and thank you so very much for what you're teaching us as it relates to our resources. God we've got a lot we really do we've got a lot of time we may not think of it that way but when we look at it there are commitments that we can make there are things that we can do with our schedules that would represent a generous spirit toward you and others. Thank you for the abilities that you've given so many in this place. It is a talented room full of people who have the ability to do so much and God I pray that they would continue each of us in this room this morning and each of us listening with the ability that you've given us God that we would be generous and others centered with that talent. God help us to know what that would look like and give us courage to make that kind of offering and with our treasure. God we want our treasure and our hearts to be focused on that which will last forever and so God please give us the grace and courage to continue to give financially at a sacrificial and regular level and thank you for what you're doing with these gifts. We are so privileged to be a part of your great kingdom work and we pray God you'd continue to give us wisdom and strength and the ability to partner with you for as long as you would allow in your son's name we pray.
[time=3568] [AMEN]
[time=3590] you
