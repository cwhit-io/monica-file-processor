[time=347] Hey, man. Hey, man.
[time=357] Praise God.
[time=377] [MUSIC - 285 seconds]
[time=664] (audience applauding) Good morning. Would you have a seat, please?
[time=672] My name is Corbin Miller and I'm the worship pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and today my job description is a little bit different, so I'm thankful for Eric and for the team and for their role this morning leading us in worship and I just want to say welcome to all of you who are here.
[time=690] I hope that you had a great Thanksgiving.
[time=692] I hope that you enjoyed time with family and friends and it's good to be together here this morning.
[time=696] Some of you might be visiting today and I just want to let you know that they're in the pew rack in front of you as a card and if you'd like to tell us a little bit about who you are, we'd love to know.
[time=706] You can fill that out, drop it in the offering plate.
[time=708] It's going to get passed later or you could hand it directly to the people who are in the booth in the lobby over on that side and they'd love to meet you and get to know you.
[time=718] This morning we're going to do things just a little bit differently and we're going to have a focus today and it's on light and how Jesus calls us to be the light of the world and we're going to mix some scripture and get some songs and some special guests who are going to share special opportunities with us about how we can apply some of the generous living that Kelly's been talking to us about for the last several weeks now.
[time=744] This morning our key verse is in Matthew chapter 5 and I'd love for you to open your Bibles and stand with me and we're going to read this together.
[time=760] Let me read it for you.
[time=762] Matthew chapter 5 says this in verse 14.
[time=790] Lord we just want to pause here to just dedicate this time
[time=796] to you.
[time=796] We pray that this entire service would just be an honor and a blessing to you and we pray God and invite your Holy Spirit to join us this morning in a unique and powerful way as we gather together.
[time=810] Pray that you'd speak to our hearts.
[time=812] We pray that you would fill our minds with truth about you and truth that is eternal.
[time=818] God I pray that you would just help us to respond to the truth of your word in a way that's practical and in a way that impacts the world around us for the sake of your name and your glory and for your praise in Jesus' name.
[time=832] [AMEN] You may be seated.
[time=834] Let me just share with you a couple of thoughts here on Matthew
[time=842] chapter 5.
[time=844] Jesus is talking to a crowd of people and because his sermon
[time=850] was recorded for us and we get to read it thousands of years later I think he's talking to us as well.
[time=856] When he says this you are the light of the world.
[time=860] And if you think about light and you think about the world just how powerful light is in the fact that it illuminates
[time=870] everything around us.
[time=872] And Jesus even alludes to it in a couple verses later that the light that is on a lamp stamp in a house that it illuminates
[time=882] the entire house.
[time=884] The light of the world is something that affects people around it I think is the point that he's trying to make there.
[time=890] What's interesting about when Jesus teaches a lot of times he'll rattle off a couple of things to kind of hook his listeners in and make them understand what he's talking about.
[time=900] And then at the end he kind of clarifies things and brings in that spiritual application.
[time=906] If you look down at verse 16 Jesus kind of correlates this to
[time=912] the people and he says in the same way let your light shine before men so that they may see your good deeds.
[time=920] And I think right there when he says they may see your good deeds that's where he kind of unlocks the mystery of what he's been talking about in a couple of verses before that the light that he's talking about the light that illuminates to those around the light that's seen by people the light is the good deeds that you and I do as believers in Christ.
[time=940] But don't stop there it says that they need to see your good deeds and then it says and praise your Father in heaven.
[time=948] How they see the light is this the good deeds that we do.
[time=952] Why they see the light is this that they may praise the Father in heaven the point of good deeds is to get more people praising the Father who is in heaven.
[time=964] So let's read through these verses one more time now that Jesus has told us that the light that he's talking about are the good deeds that you and I do.
[time=972] It says this read it again from verse 14 you are the light of the world.
[time=980] A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
[time=982] I think everybody who was hearing him they were nodding their heads in agreement.
[time=986] Yeah a city on a hill can't be hidden the light that a city exudes.
[time=990] It's going to permeate the dark land around it.
[time=992] Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[time=996] I think they were all nodding their heads to that and saying that makes sense.
[time=1000] You don't have light which we've learned is good deeds and you don't hide it from people.
[time=1004] And they said instead they put it on a stand and it gives light.
[time=1008] It gives everyone in the house.
[time=1010] And so this light this good deeds is something that's visible by other people.
[time=1016] And the same way let your light shine before men so that they may see your good deeds
[time=1022] and praise your Father in heaven.
[time=1026] I'm going to invite Kelly to come and he's going to share with you a little bit more of what today's service is going to look like.
[time=1032] And he's also going to talk to you about a chance that we have as a family at Blackhawk to participate in a good deed.
[time=1040] And we're going to look at several others this morning too.
[time=1042] I just want to invite you to listen and I want to invite you to search your hearts and ask yourself the question are you light to the world around you and ask yourself the question do people see good deeds in me.
[time=1054] Thank you Corbin very much.
[time=1058] And good morning it's so nice to see all of you.
[time=1060] And I'm so thankful for the opportunity to just get a couple of minutes with you here to begin our morning. We've kind of entitled our morning generous opportunities.
[time=1068] Generous opportunities. I am so thankful my friends the response that we've received
[time=1074] over the last three or four weeks you know a couple months ago while we were in the Kidnapped series.
[time=1080] I didn't think I had ever seen and I hadn't ever seen a response from you like I had seen during the Kidnapped series.
[time=1088] The letters, the emails, the hallway conversations, the things that we saw God doing.
[time=1092] It was so unbelievable and so very encouraging for us.
[time=1096] I would say in the last four or five weeks it's been that all over again and maybe even more
[time=1102] to see what God has been doing in you.
[time=1104] The youngest of you all the way to the oldest of you.
[time=1108] To see how you are responding to this idea of a generous response to God.
[time=1114] Has been just absolutely overwhelming and I'm so thankful for what He does in you and in me.
[time=1120] And as we thought about the last four or five weeks and this teaching that we've been in the midst
[time=1126] of regarding a generous response with our time and our talent and our treasure.
[time=1130] We wanted this morning to give you an opportunity at a very practical level.
[time=1136] I mean at a very very practical level we wanted to give you opportunities to respond.
[time=1140] These aren't the only three responses that you can have to the last four or five weeks.
[time=1146] But these are three very very doable ones.
[time=1150] And we just want to just take the time this morning.
[time=1152] We're going to Corbin's going to continue to kind of teach and give us some things to think about
[time=1158] through Matthew 5 and I want to and others are going to make available to you.
[time=1162] And we're going to bring emphasis to three great opportunities that I'm so thankful for.
[time=1166] The first of which is our year end giving opportunity.
[time=1172] Now just there in saying that our year end giving opportunity.
[time=1176] Before you tune me out, before you think that's just about money I just want to share with you.
[time=1182] Not only have you been learning and not only have you been growing but we've been growing as leaders.
[time=1188] And almost every year you know we would come to you and we will more than likely as the years have gone by.
[time=1196] It's been my experience that we come to you as a family and say hey with your end coming up.
[time=1202] We want to just encourage you to if God puts it on your heart to give a little above and beyond.
[time=1208] We'd really appreciate it.
[time=1210] Usually the request is for you to give some thought to that so that it can help maybe us catch up
[time=1216] if we're in a deficit situation.
[time=1218] Maybe it's so that we can continue to do some things that we'd love to do.
[time=1222] Maybe it's to start some new ministry opportunities.
[time=1224] And there isn't anything I don't think nothing wrong with that.
[time=1228] We've talked about that in recent weeks the offering plate, the video we showed you.
[time=1232] What God is doing inside and outside these four walls through your gifts.
[time=1236] It's an amazing thing but I just want to say this to you.
[time=1240] This year it's a little bit different and I'm so thankful for the difference.
[time=1244] It does something to my heart when I think about the opportunity that I think God's giving us as a family.
[time=1250] Would you open up your bulletin and would you take out this little manila giving envelope that says outside inside 2006 year end giving opportunity.
[time=1262] Check this out.
[time=1262] I'm so glad and I'm so thankful and you know what?
[time=1264] I'm so excited to see what God's going to do through you, through this family on this year end effort.
[time=1270] Black Hawk Ministries, outside end year end giving opportunity.
[time=1274] What we're going to do this year is this.
[time=1276] We had just felt compelled in our hearts to have this offering this year, this year end gift that we're praying that you'll give.
[time=1284] We just felt as a leadership we felt compelled to have it be about something initially at least other than us.
[time=1292] We wanted it to go towards something that would be other than our own needs.
[time=1298] We wanted it to go toward people.
[time=1300] We wanted it to go toward a real life situation where there are real needs and where the Kingdom of God is moving forward
[time=1308] and where we could possibly with our generosity come alongside and help and encourage.
[time=1312] And I'm sure in the process be encouraged.
[time=1314] And so I just want to announce to you this morning as a family that we have found and it's not a recent finding.
[time=1322] This thing's been around for a while but there's a ministry that we've chosen to make and include in our year end gift
[time=1330] and it's called the Mission Church.
[time=1332] And the Mission Church, Tim and Karen Stauffer give leadership to the Mission Church these days.
[time=1338] The Mission Church is housed at the Rescue Mission downtown.
[time=1342] They serve a very unique and very special demographic of folks and it was founded years ago by Amos and Elizabeth Zare.
[time=1352] You see their pictures there housed at the Rescue Mission founded by the Zare's today led by Tim and Karen Stauffer.
[time=1358] And I want to just give you a taste for what this ministry is like and what it entails.
[time=1362] I'm so thankful.
[time=1364] We are so grateful for what God does through Tim and Karen and those that help ministers to the physical,
[time=1370] spiritual and financial needs of inner city people.
[time=1374] Probably right now Tim would tell you, Tim and Karen would tell you 50 children are in that mix,
[time=1380] ranging in ages from 5 to 19 years of age.
[time=1382] The oldest two are enrolled in college and they are all so thankful for that.
[time=1388] A mission statement for the Mission Church, whatever you did for one of the least of these,
[time=1394] Jesus said, you did for me.
[time=1396] And look at their goal.
[time=1398] Their goal is to break the cycle of poverty.
[time=1402] As I've talked with Tim and Karen in the past, they would say their goal, their hope, their prayer is to try to with the resources they have and the energy that they're expending
[time=1412] and the ministry that God gives them, they're trying to break the cycle of poverty, they're trying to break the cycle of addiction, they're trying to break the cycle of broken homes.
[time=1420] And they are right down there in the absolute midst of all of that, my friends.
[time=1426] And they are giving themselves tirelessly and relentlessly to that effort.
[time=1430] And it is an absolute joy to know them.
[time=1434] They have been a huge encouragement to me personally.
[time=1436] There are no facility costs, there are no administration fees, no staff salaries.
[time=1442] And Karen and those who volunteered do all of it at a volunteer level, they give themselves day in and day out to this ministry, no overhead, zero operating expenses.
[time=1452] Expenditures, 100% food and clothing, food and clothing are a huge part of this ministry.
[time=1462] These are the needs of the people that the Mission Church reaches out to.
[time=1466] Food and clothing, school supplies, emergency care, dental and medical care,
[time=1472] these are the kinds of things they're hoping and wanting to provide.
[time=1476] I had Tim write a few things down, I want to just share this with you.
[time=1480] These are some huge needs, these are everyday needs that they face at the Mission Church.
[time=1484] Winter coats, boots, gloves, hats, tennis shoes, we would need enough for 50 kids and 40 adults,
[time=1494] about 50/50 male/female.
[time=1496] Almost every middle class family has coats in the closet from the last year
[time=1502] that will not be worn this year, raise your hand if you know that to be true.
[time=1508] The coats, if the coats are clean and the zippers work, they are valuable to our ministry and the opportunity to introduce ourselves into an inner city home.
[time=1518] Tennis shoes, if they can be worn, if they're still functional, can be a huge help and a huge blessing.
[time=1524] Good used cars, I thought this was interesting.
[time=1526] We need about three to four good used cars, they don't have to be pretty, they don't have to be really nice, they just have to work.
[time=1534] We have a mechanic who keeps our fleet of old cars running.
[time=1536] Without these cars, listen to this, without these cars, grandmothers, grandmothers cannot do a good job of keeping the household running.
[time=1546] So many of these folks are held together by faithful grandmothers
[time=1552] who try to get kids to church, who try and take kids to school, who try and get kids to the doctor.
[time=1558] And they need cars, good used cars, canned meats.
[time=1562] I saw that, I thought, hmm, canned meats.
[time=1566] Most inner city households don't have, what, freezers.
[time=1572] I think I've got three.
[time=1576] I don't know how many you have.
[time=1578] I think I got more than two, I know that.
[time=1582] No freezers, so canned meat is of the highest importance to many of these families.
[time=1588] As I talked with Tim, here's what we found out.
[time=1592] We found out that for all of that and more to take place, their hope, their prayer, their begging of God
[time=1598] is that he would somehow supply, as the years go by, it's always been about the same.
[time=1602] Twenty, twenty-five, thirty thousand dollars, an annual budget of thirty thousand dollars.
[time=1608] And so, what we're offering you this morning is this.
[time=1612] Leadership here at Blackhawk has decided that this year's year in giving, whatever God moves in your hearts to give.
[time=1618] We have needs here, that's true, we do.
[time=1622] There are some things that we really do need some help with.
[time=1624] Most thirty thousand that you give will go toward the Mission Church.
[time=1630] Amen? Amen.
[time=1632] And then whatever you give above and beyond that, we'll put to really, really good use.
[time=1638] But we want to encourage you as individuals, we want to encourage you as families.
[time=1642] Listen, how can your kids participate in this?
[time=1646] What kind of, what kind of maybe reductions would you make this Christmas as a family?
[time=1650] What kind of decisions might you be willing to make individually?
[time=1654] Or as a family, in terms of how you, how you spend your resources at Christmas this year,
[time=1660] to provide for maybe a little extra on the gift side?
[time=1664] Give some thought to that.
[time=1666] How could you individually, how can you as a small group of men or a small group of women or a couples group that meets in a home, how could you as a class, how could we as a family sacrificially give with this year-end opportunity? I just want to encourage you to be generous
[time=1682] in the way that you think this through. We'll tell you more about it in the weeks to come.
[time=1684] But don't lose that envelope. Please hold on to that envelope.
[time=1688] We'll make some more available as the weeks go by.
[time=1690] But just be thanking God for the chance He gives us to offer ourselves and our resources
[time=1696] and our time to such great, great causes and such great people, like the staffers and those who help down there at the Mission Church.
[time=1704] So give some thought to that. Let me just pray for you before we sing and worship our God some more this morning. Father God, what a great and mighty God you are.
[time=1714] What an amazing heart you have for those in the suburbs, for those in the inner city, for those across the world, God so many, whose need looks so different.
[time=1724] And God, as we think about our dear friends, right here in our own community and as we think about a year-end gift, God, I pray that each person in this room
[time=1734] and each person listening would be willing between now and the end of December to give serious thought to the kind of gift, the kind of monetary financial gift
[time=1744] that they would want to put together to give toward an effort like this.
[time=1748] Thank you for this family. Thank you for how you're teaching us to be generous in the way we view life and the opportunities that you give us to give.
[time=1756] And God, thank you for what that will do and thank you for what that will mean, not only in our own hearts and lives, but God, what it will mean in the hearts and lives of those who you allow us to come alongside.
[time=1768] You are a great God. Thank you for the privilege we have this morning of worshiping you in your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1786] [MUSIC - 64 seconds]
[time=1854] Sing it with us. Praise God.
[time=1858] [MUSIC - 166 seconds]
[time=2032] You are the light of the world.
[time=2036] The city on a hill cannot be hidden.
[time=2040] Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[time=2044] Instead they put it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house.
[time=2048] In the same way, let your light shine before men so that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.
[time=2058] Today, Kelly and Deborah are over across the hallway in a classroom
[time=2064] doing a panel for the help on the home front class.
[time=2068] So, unfortunately, you're stuck with me for the rest of the hour.
[time=2072] And what we're going to do, like Kelly said, is look at a couple more opportunities that you have that we're going to extend your way to be generous with your lives in the next couple of months.
[time=2082] And before we do that, I just want you to look with me again in the book of Matthew.
[time=2088] And this time, flip over to chapter six.
[time=2090] That last phrase that I just quoted said in the same way,
[time=2098] let your light shine before men so that others may see your good deeds
[time=2104] and praise your Father in heaven.
[time=2106] That word so tells us the reason why we're letting people see our good deeds.
[time=2112] And it talks about motivation.
[time=2114] The motivation of why we could do good deeds is not about us, but it's about God.
[time=2120] And it's about the furtherance of his kingdom and the praise of his glory.
[time=2126] Look at chapter six, verse one, and read with me.
[time=2130] Be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them.
[time=2136] If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
[time=2140] So, when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men.
[time=2150] I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.
[time=2154] But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
[time=2160] so that your giving may be done in secret.
[time=2162] Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
[time=2170] When I read that, there's a little bit of attention there because I start scratching my head and thinking about the previous chapter.
[time=2176] And in the previous chapter, Jesus said, I needed to put my good deeds on a lamp stand so that it would get light to everyone in the house and that that's the way people are going to glorify God.
[time=2184] And heaven is seeing the good deeds.
[time=2188] But then over here in the next chapter, it says that giving should be done in secret.
[time=2192] Now, not all good deeds are giving, but giving is a primary way that a good deed can get done.
[time=2198] So, there's a little bit of attention.
[time=2200] You know, which one is it showing good deeds so that everyone sees them?
[time=2204] Or is it doing the deeds in secret?
[time=2206] And I don't necessarily have an answer to that, but it's in both places.
[time=2212] And Jesus is preaching the same sermon.
[time=2214] Chapters 5, 6 and 7 are all the same time on the mountain.
[time=2220] And in one chapter, he talks about putting your good deeds on a lamp stand.
[time=2224] In the next chapter, he talks about giving in secret.
[time=2226] I think there's a tension there, but if you look at the first verse of chapter 6 one more time,
[time=2232] I think the quotation marks tell us something.
[time=2236] It says, "Be careful not to do your quote unquote acts of righteousness
[time=2242] before men to be seen by them." And I think again right here, it just talks about motive.
[time=2248] It talks about why we do the good deeds.
[time=2252] The acts of righteousness is in quotations, I believe, because just doing an act of righteousness doesn't make it an act of righteousness.
[time=2262] But it's an act of righteousness coupled with a heart that is humble and a heart that wants to do it not for the purpose of being prideful or arrogant,
[time=2270] but a heart that wants to do it to further the kingdom of God and a heart that wants to do it so that others may see the glory of God and praise Him for it.
[time=2280] So I think it's important when we talk about giving and we talk about generous opportunities to just mention that motive is really, really important
[time=2288] because the whole giving could get thrown out if it's done with a motive that's impure or a motive that's about self-gain instead of God-gain.
[time=2298] To flip over to 2 Corinthians 4, check this out too, along the same lines of motives, 2 Corinthians chapter 4.
[time=2318] Okay, 2 Corinthians 4, verse 6 and 7. Let me read it for you. For God said, let light shine out of darkness.
[time=2330] I messed that up, let's try to get it. For God, here we go. For God who said, let light shine out of darkness made His light shine in our hearts
[time=2338] to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[time=2344] But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from God and not from us.
[time=2352] I think these two verses, if we have those in our minds and our hearts when we're getting ready to do a good deed,
[time=2358] that that'll prevent us from having a quote-unquote "active righteousness" and it'll help us to be mindful of who we are.
[time=2366] Look at it again in verse 6. It says that the same God who said basically let there be light, this is the same God that puts light in our hearts
[time=2376] and the light that He's talking about here is the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[time=2384] Basically, He's saying, knowing Christ, that is what light in your heart is. In the next verse He calls it a treasure.
[time=2392] He says, we have this treasure, the treasure is the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[time=2400] And we have this treasure in jars of clay and that should remind us that our bodies in our flesh, that we're sinful and we make mistakes
[time=2410] and we're not perfect and we're not claiming our own perfection and we're not claiming our own righteousness but we're claiming the righteousness of Christ.
[time=2418] And we're claiming the face of Christ is the treasure in our jar of clay and it's not good deeds for Corbin's gain but it's good deeds for God's gain.
[time=2430] We have this treasure in jars of clay for this reason, to show that this all surpassing power is from God and not from us.
[time=2442] I think that it's really, really important when we talk about good deeds to approach them with the right heart attitude.
[time=2450] In the moment we start approaching a good deed with the wrong heart attitude, we're going to get ourselves into trouble. And like Jesus said in Matthew 6, we've already gotten our reward
[time=2460] and there'll be no heavenly reward for us if we try to approach a good deed with a bad heart.
[time=2466] John, would you come up? I'm going to have John Bars come up and just talk to you a little bit about another opportunity to be generous with your time and with your lives.
[time=2476] John is the co-founder of NeighborLink Fort Wayne and I love John for just a start out if you would just kind of fill the people in about how that got started and how we got to where we are today.
[time=2488] Sounds good, good morning. NeighborLink's been around since the fall of 2002 and that's when we launched our website and we've got the website actually out, that's our homepage.
[time=2498] And you can get there by typing nlfw.org. And the history of it Corbin is we were doing servant evangelism.
[time=2508] You may remember back in 2000, 2001 we were meeting across the street in the asylum on the third Saturday of every month and we'd go out and do free giveaways with no strings attached.
[time=2520] And we would go give away light bulbs and toilet paper, pop water, about anything you'd give away. We'd give people a connection card saying, "God loves you, there's no strings attached, have a nice day."
[time=2530] And the more we did that, the more we met people who had much different, much bigger needs.
[time=2536] And so we came back and said, "There must be some way we can organize people who want to serve with people who are in need."
[time=2542] And so what we did is we put together a website that actually does just that. It finds the people who are in need in their projects and then it helps us organize ourselves and servant teams to go do the projects.
[time=2554] So you're talking about a felt need instead of a need that's imposed on by the one who's serving?
[time=2560] Correct.
[time=2562] So tell us a little bit about the website and how people get logged on and we talked about this before.
[time=2568] I'm sure it's familiar to many of you, but there might be some who don't know how to do it or haven't done it yet. Could you explain it?
[time=2574] Absolutely. There's really two ways to get involved if you wanted to serve. The first obvious way is to go to the website, again, nlfw.org.
[time=2582] And on there, there's a little point you can put your click on and it says volunteer.
[time=2588] And if you click on that, it'll take you there to a bar that you can fill out and ask for your name, address, phone number.
[time=2598] They're getting it. There it is.
[time=2600] And if you kind of scroll down, ask you to pick a password because that's how you'll log in every time.
[time=2606] You'll use your name and your password.
[time=2608] And then at the very bottom of the form, it gives some different things you're good at.
[time=2610] Some people are really good with lawn care. Other people are good with plumbing, electrical, and you can kind of check as many boxes as applied to your gift mix.
[time=2620] And then you submit at the bottom and we house that on a searchable database and allows us to organize projects and find people who have really good skills for what we are doing to make contact with you.
[time=2632] Sounds good. Tell us one more thing.
[time=2636] If you bypass the website altogether, how can you still be a part of what neighboring Fort Wayne is doing?
[time=2642] Absolutely. If you look in your bulletin on the very left-hand sign, there's always a little ad there for NeighborLink.
[time=2646] And we serve on the third Saturday of every month. We just kind of kept that as a traditional time to get together.
[time=2652] We meet down at the Rialto Theater on South Calhoun at 9 a.m., the third Saturday of every month.
[time=2660] And you can go down there and just show up. There's always some coaches looking for people who would be going to volunteer and be flexible, and so you can go serve in that way.
[time=2668] Awesome. Hey, I just want to tell you that I'm really thankful for you and for the way that you serve our church as an elder here and for the way that you've just kind of taken up this whole idea on your shoulders as a way that you could lead others into doing more.
[time=2686] I just think that's really valuable, and I just thank you for it, and so thanks. Could we tell John how thankful we are?
[time=2698] Why don't you stand and we are going to sing a song together about how thankful we are for Christ and for His blood shed for us. Let's sing together.
[time=2716] [MUSIC]
[time=2722] Our child, the father has lavished on us, that we should be called His son and daughters, precious in His side.
[time=2742] Greater love, His world has never seen.
[time=2750] When he hung on a tree on mine, would he do such a thing for dirty sinners like you and me, oh God?
[time=2766] Thank you for loving me. When on the cross you made history.
[time=2774] Lord, you died for me forever. My praise will go duly, oh God.
[time=2786] Thank you for choosing me to be a child and bear your name. Oh Jesus, I will never cease to sing your praise.
[time=2806] Your love is patient and humble and God. It's greater than all my sin.
[time=2818] Always protects and trusts and hopes and will have no end. Your love lifted me up from the dead, set my feet on a solid rock.
[time=2838] With the firm place to stand, Lord, I always will trust in your loving and oh God.
[time=2850] Thank you for loving me. When on the cross you made history.
[time=2858] Lord, you died for me forever. My praise will go duly, oh God.
[time=2870] Thank you for choosing me to be a child and bear your name. Oh Jesus, I will never cease to sing your praise.
[time=2888] How high how deep, how endless is your love for me? How high how long? How high how deep, how endless is your love for me?
[time=2930] Lord, you died for me forever. My praise will go duly, oh God. Thank you for loving me. When on the cross you made history.
[time=2944] For me forever, my praise will go gently, oh God. Thank you for choosing me to be a child and bear your name.
[time=2962] On Jesus, I will never cease to sing. Say all again, oh God. Thank you for loving me. When on the cross you made history.
[time=2982] Lord, you died for me forever. My praise will go duly, oh God. Thank you for choosing me to be a child and bear your name.
[time=3002] On Jesus, I will never cease to sing your praise. Let's say thank you. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for loving me.
[time=3020] Thank you for loving me. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for loving me.
[time=3042] You may be seated. Thinking about neighbor link a little bit and some of the things that John shared with us.
[time=3054] Especially that third Saturday, the month thing in my own heart, in mind, I'm just thinking about all the different things that I do on a Saturday morning and how many of them are not investing in heavenly things.
[time=3068] Remember last week Kelly was talking with us about the passage where Jesus says that you don't want to store up treasures for yourselves on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
[time=3080] But to store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[time=3088] And I think the things that happen via neighbor link are an example of a way that you could store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where the moth and rust don't destroy and where the thieves don't break in steal.
[time=3106] In the light of the world, a city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead you put it on a lamp stand and it gives light to everyone in the house.
[time=3120] In the same way, let your light shine before men so that they may see your good deeds and praise your father in heaven.
[time=3130] Turn to James chapter two, please. I'm going to talk with you just a little bit about this phrase good deeds.
[time=3150] James chapter two verse 14. And I'm just going to read from here to the end of the chapter. And I think it's important for us to have a good context of what Matthew chapter five is telling us when it talks about good deeds.
[time=3166] And I think it's really important to look at this chapter because it talks about faith in deeds. Let me read it for you.
[time=3174] Verse 14. What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?
[time=3184] Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, go, I wish you well, keep warm and well fed, but does nothing about his physical needs. What good is it?
[time=3198] In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, you have faith, I have deeds.
[time=3212] Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. You believe that there is one God, good, even the demons believe that, and shudder.
[time=3224] You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
[time=3238] You see that his faith and his actions were working together and his faith was made complete by what he did.
[time=3246] And the scripture was fulfilled that says Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness, and he was called God's friend.
[time=3254] You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.
[time=3260] In the same way, was not even Rahad the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction.
[time=3270] As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
[time=3278] I'm a little bit nervous when I turn to James chapter two because I feel like if I talk too much, then I'll start talking in circles and I'll mess up and say something I didn't mean to at all.
[time=3288] So, I'm just going to speak briefly about something that I notice here in James chapter two as it relates to our good deeds.
[time=3296] You notice how James says, what verse was it, 22, he says Abraham's faith and his actions were working together.
[time=3306] I think it's important if we want to avoid a faith that is dead, that we get our faith and our actions working together like Abraham did.
[time=3316] And this is kind of the way I think of it.
[time=3320] You know about cause and effect relationships, right?
[time=3324] A cause happens and therefore an effect happens.
[time=3328] There are gray clouds in the sky, therefore it rains.
[time=3332] That type of thing, cause and effect relationships.
[time=3336] I think the way I understand it, that faith is the faith and deeds work together like this.
[time=3346] Now I'm a friend, I'm going to mess it up.
[time=3348] Faith without deeds is dead, right?
[time=3350] So, we've got this cause, salvation, and deeds do not lead to the cause of salvation.
[time=3358] Never will I do enough things to earn the right to be saved, never will I do enough things to be saved.
[time=3366] That's a free gift and it comes by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone.
[time=3372] But then there's an effect that happens after salvation.
[time=3376] And the effect that happens after salvation is this thing called good deeds.
[time=3380] And without these two working together like James said in verse 22, then we end up with a dead faith.
[time=3388] I think it's really, really important for us as believers and for us as a church to make sure that the cause of salvation is leading to the effect of good deeds.
[time=3398] Did that make sense?
[time=3400] I think that if we've got this cause of salvation and it leads to nothing, if it leads to no good deeds,
[time=3406] then we wind up like they did here who James is talking about here in chapter 2, people with a dead faith.
[time=3412] And I don't want to be a person with dead faith and I don't want you to be people with dead faith.
[time=3418] So, let's get our faith and our actions working together.
[time=3422] Let me show you one other thing and that's in the book of Philippians.
[time=3426] So, turn back to book of Philippians.
[time=3436] Now I know why Kelly doesn't use a mic in his hand because you can't turn the pages of your Bible.
[time=3442] Got it. Okay. Hope you're there too.
[time=3452] Philippians chapter 2, I just want to tell you a little bit about this guy named Apaphroditis and what he did and what the church did that sent him to help out Paul.
[time=3462] Philippians chapter 2 verse 25 mentions a man named Apaphroditis and I think it's really interesting to know that Paul, this is one of the last letters that he wrote before he died.
[time=3472] And the circumstance that Paul finds himself in, he's in on house arrest, which is kind of like prison, but with a little bit more freedom.
[time=3482] And so Paul is basically in jail and this is one of his prison epistles.
[time=3486] And what he says in chapter 2 verse 25, he mentions Apaphroditis, let's read it.
[time=3492] But I think it is necessary to send back to you, Apaphroditis, my brother, fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger who you sent to take care of my needs.
[time=3504] So what's happening here, the church in Philippi, a church that Paul helped start, a church that Paul invested in that he shepherded and led prior to being on house arrest.
[time=3514] They are hearing of Paul's need and so they sent to Paul this man named Apaphroditis and we'll see you later on in chapter 4 that Apaphroditis also brought gifts to Paul.
[time=3526] Go over to chapter 4, Philippians chapter 4 verse 14.
[time=3534] So we've got Paul in need on house arrest, the church in Philippi sends a man, Apaphroditis to him and this is what Paul says, verse 14.
[time=3542] Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.
[time=3546] Moreover, as you Philippians know in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out for Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only.
[time=3558] For even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid again and again when I was in need.
[time=3564] Not that I'm looking for a gift, but I am looking for what may be credited to your account, which I think is very interesting by the way, but we'll keep moving.
[time=3572] I have received full payment and even more, I'm amply supplied.
[time=3576] Now that I've received from Apaphroditis the gifts you sent, they are a fragrant offering and acceptable sacrifice pleasing to God.
[time=3586] So there's Apaphroditis again mentioned and he's giving gifts to Paul who is in need.
[time=3592] And I love the language that Paul uses, he says, they are a fragrant offering and acceptable sacrifice.
[time=3600] As a worship leader, when I hear those words anywhere in the scriptures, my ears kind of perk up because it reminds me of Old Testament temple worship, where it talks about the sacrifices being a fragrant offering to the Lord and how people would burn their offerings
[time=3616] and their prized possessions of rams and goats and sheep and calves and all sorts of offerings to God.
[time=3624] When it talks about offerings and sacrifices, it's talking about worship.
[time=3630] So in the Old Testament, it's talking about worship that is animal sacrifice and now Paul uses the very words to describe what the church in Philippi did when they sent Apaphroditis.
[time=3640] They sent him an act of worship.
[time=3644] The good deed that the church did when they got gifts together and they sent their brother Apaphroditis, Paul's way.
[time=3650] Paul says that's worship, that's a fragrant offering, that's an acceptable sacrifice pleasing to God.
[time=3658] And so before I invite another guy up to share something, I just want to get on a quick soapbox because I am a worship leader and because I don't get to hold a microphone and chat with you that often, here's my soapbox.
[time=3670] I just get a little irritated sometimes that marketing strategies of Christian music and stuff, they tend to mess with our thinking.
[time=3682] And I think they've done a disservice to you and to me because they've made us think that the word worship means music.
[time=3690] And I think that's dangerous because although music is a form of worship, music and worship are not exactly the same thing, music is a piece of all that worship is.
[time=3704] Worship is an umbrella that's so much bigger than music and I love when we get together on Sunday mornings and we use music to worship our God and we sing songs of praise that speak truth about his character and speak songs of thanks for the acts that he's done.
[time=3720] But that's not all encompassing.
[time=3722] Chatting about the Bible is an act of worship.
[time=3724] What Paul said in Philippians when we give good gifts to others, that's an acceptable sacrifice of worship.
[time=3732] When we set our minds on things above instead of earthly things, that's worship.
[time=3736] Worship is just our response to God for his character and for the things that he's done off the soapbox now.
[time=3744] So Bill, why don't you come up?
[time=3746] I want to introduce to you Dr. Bill Culp and he's going to talk to us a little bit today about an experience that he had in helping with Katrina relief down in Mississippi, right?
[time=3758] Biloxi, Mississippi, and then he's going to tell you about more chances that are coming up to do the very same thing.
[time=3764] So, Bill, why don't you share with them a little bit about what happened and set up the video that you brought to show them to.
[time=3774] I had a wonderful opportunity last April, my son and I, and about 24 other men and women from the Fort Wayne area traveled to Biloxi, where we took part in two primary service projects.
[time=3798] Each of the two teams was involved in the reconstruction of roofs on homes that had been damaged by what has been described as this country's worst natural disaster, Hurricane Katrina.
[time=3820] Our team was led by my son, David, and I must give some credit and appreciation to the time devoted by and put forth by my good friend Jim Mayley, who taught David,
[time=3848] many of his carpentry skills, and then he was able to use them in these projects.
[time=3856] We were not only challenged very physically but cannot be helped but be inspired profoundly by the extent of the damage and the lives that were impacted.
[time=3876] And in many cases torn apart, I think of Ethel, who standing in the midst of the rubble of what used to be her home, said, "The Lord, giveth, and the Lord, take it away, blessed be the name of the Lord."
[time=3896] And my good friend Doug DeSilvie, who in preparation for the storm sequestered his family in not his own home, which we prepared, but in his in-laws home, thinking that it would be more durable under the conditions of the storm.
[time=3922] So he brought his invalid wife and his only child, adult daughter, and with his in-laws were to ride out the storm.
[time=3938] And what happens after that, I'd like to introduce you to Baba, who I affectionately have given the name of Baba to Doug DeSilvie.
[time=3968] I was sure by now, God he would have reached down and wiped our tears away, stepped in and saved the day.
[time=3984] But once again, I say amen and it's still raining.
[time=3994] ♪
[time=4018] We went over to Donna's grandmother's house, prepare for the storm.
[time=4022] We had just had a memorial service for my dad, he had just passed away the money before the storm, and all the family was in here.
[time=4030] I said, "Everybody hold everybody's hand." I said, "We're gonna have to get into the water here soon, stay together."
[time=4036] I heard a whirling noise, turned around and looked, and the roof was raised up, and where I was with the back end of the room, the roof raised up, and the action of the water had pushed the walls away.
[time=4048] And they were all in the front, by an eight inch front door of the whole of a bedroom.
[time=4052] And when the roof came back down, there was no wall there to hold it, and it was candid towards them.
[time=4058] And this back end here was still up, although I was under water, probably four or five feet I could still see daylight.
[time=4066] And I was getting breathing air out of the raptor pockets that had already been torn up by the wave action.
[time=4072] And I just kept asking, "Jesus, don't let me drown this way, I gotta get my family out." And the last thing I saw with him.
[time=4078] You've asked me for air.
[time=4090] It was, I realized that whenever we were all under the roof, it wasn't anything I could do.
[time=4106] And I didn't know you three, and I stayed there probably three hours till the water started.
[time=4114] And I was thinking about my family, and all of a sudden, it was the fall of the floor.
[time=4120] I feel like I really didn't want to live. I didn't care.
[time=4128] You know, everything you worked for.
[time=4136] And all these four people gathered on me 100%.
[time=4140] I just got to keep believing that God's got me here for a reason.
[time=4158] I'm just going to keep going and keep doing what I got to do to be positive for everybody.
[time=4164] You know, other people probably need something that I don't know.
[time=4166] I'll be giving them down a road, you know.
[time=4168] But I just can't think enough, thank y'all enough for coming down and getting my roof.
[time=4172] It'll get me going now and the rest of my house.
[time=4176] And I'm just blessed. I'm a blessed man.
[time=4178] A guy may have taken my family away from me, but...
[time=4180] He's got a new one.
[time=4194] I know my heart is torn, and my heart is torn, and my brain is torn, and my brain is torn.
[time=4224] God may have taken my family away from me, but he gave me a new one.
[time=4232] Adoption is one of the purest forms of love.
[time=4242] Ephesians 1-5 says, "In love, he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ
[time=4252] in accordance with his pleasure and will."
[time=4258] We were all challenged to let our light not only be involved in reconstruction, rehabilitation,
[time=4270] but I think we're responsible for the light, God's light, through us, to express a redemptive relationship
[time=4284] of our adopting Heavenly Father to all we come in contact with.
[time=4290] Bubba lives in Biloxi, Mississippi. Bubba also lives in Ivanovab, Russia.
[time=4300] He also lives in Uganda. He also lives in the orphanages of South Africa.
[time=4308] Bubba lives in the rescue mission in Fort Wayne.
[time=4312] Bubba lives in our neighborhoods. Bubba lives in neighbors of ours that may be struggling with their marriages.
[time=4324] I think we're called by God to adopt the Bubbas in our lives as he adopted us.
[time=4340] How can we become a part of Bubba's family?
[time=4344] Primarily through prayer, and there are newer opportunities that we can even become involved directly in projects
[time=4354] in Biloxi, Mississippi through a hope crisis and living at Hope City.
[time=4362] It's a wonderful project that a series of trailers with living facilities in the kitchen
[time=4372] that you have an opportunity to spend a week down there.
[time=4376] And it's right on the coast, a coast that incurred a 20 to 30 foot water swell.
[time=4386] It was like a tsunami in the storm surge and it was in this storm surge that Doug lost his family.
[time=4398] But as he said, now I have a new family.
[time=4404] There are projects scheduled for January as happens to be full.
[time=4410] There are projects timed through Blackhawk in February, April, July and August.
[time=4418] And I would encourage every one of you to in some way participate in one of these projects.
[time=4428] You will be stretched. There is no growth other than through challenge and stretching.
[time=4434] And I was thoroughly exhausted and something outside of my field.
[time=4444] And I was probably the first broken clay vessel there.
[time=4452] But I think we're called for each of us to search out in our own hearts,
[time=4462] to determine how we can best adopt Baba wherever he is into our family.
[time=4470] Thank you, Dr. Colton. I mean, thank you.
[time=4476] Okay.
[time=4482] Just take a look at the screens and notice that the next trip is coming up at the end of February.
[time=4488] There are still some openings left, but like Dr. Colton mentioned, there are some other trips that are scheduled for later on in the year.
[time=4494] Cost of only $200 and you'll get trained when you're down there in order to do the type of work that they have scheduled for you that particular week.
[time=4502] And yeah, the other trips are scheduled and they're listed on the website where I'm sure you could make a phone call and talk to anybody here that you'd like to get answers to any questions you might have.
[time=4514] Why don't we stand together and as we do, I'm going to invite the ushers to come forward and we are just going to sing one final song together.
[time=4524] And the offering will be collected and I just want to remind you to just be a generous people and all that God has done for you and all that he has given you
[time=4536] and the blessings that you received in your life there for a purpose.
[time=4540] And it's not to hoard and to be stingy and to be greedy, but he's given those blessings to you in order to be generous and in order to bless other people with the same blessings you've received.
[time=4552] Today we talked about three things, but I'm sure that there are many other things in life, other small ways and other big ways that you can be generous with your life.
[time=4560] So I would encourage you to do so.
[time=4562] Let me pray for the offering and the guys can pass the plates while we begin to sing.
[time=4568] Lord God, we just again acknowledge all of who you are.
[time=4572] We praise you for being a great and awesome God.
[time=4576] We thank you for the blessings that you've given to us.
[time=4580] So many that God, it's hard to even name and list them all.
[time=4584] You've been that generous.
[time=4586] We pray, God, that you would begin to transform our thinking.
[time=4590] Transform our thinking to be more heavenly-minded instead of fleshly and earthly-minded.
[time=4596] That helps us to be generous with the resources you've given us.
[time=4600] Help us to be light to the world around us and to not hide it under a bull, but to put it on a lamp stand so that others may see our good deeds and glorify you, our Father, who is in heaven.
[time=4612] We pray that it would be so for the furtherance of your kingdom.
[time=4616] We pray that it would be so for the honor and glory and praise of you, Jesus.
[time=4622] And we pray this in your name, amen.
[time=4626] Let's sing this together.
[time=4646] We will remember.
[time=4658] We will remember the works of your hand.
[time=4664] We will stop and give you praise.
[time=4670] For great is our faithful name.
[time=4674] Let's sing that again.
[time=4676] We will remember.
[time=4682] We will remember the works of your hand.
[time=4688] And we will stop and give you praise.
[time=4694] For great is our faithful name.
[time=4700] You're our creator, our life-sustainer.
[time=4708] Dealing in the river, our comfort and joy.
[time=4714] Throughout the ages, you've been our shelter.
[time=4720] Our peace, the midst of the storm.
[time=4724] Sides and work with signs and wonder.
[time=4730] You've shown your power with precious blood.
[time=4734] You've shown us your grace.
[time=4738] You've been our helper.
[time=4742] Our numerator, our giver, our life with no hand.
[time=4750] For the folks, we will remember.
[time=4754] We will remember.
[time=4756] We will remember the works of your hand.
[time=4764] We will stop and give you praise.
[time=4768] For great is our faithful name.
[time=4774] When we walk through life's darkest valleys.
[time=4782] We will pass at all you have done.
[time=4788] And we will shout.
[time=4790] Our God is good and He is the faithful one.
[time=4798] Let's sing some Hallelujah.
[time=4800] Hallelujah.
[time=4806] To the one from all blessings formed.
[time=4812] Hallelujah.
[time=4818] To the one whose glory has been shown.
[time=4824] We will remember.
[time=4830] We will remember the works of your hand.
[time=4838] We will stop and give you praise.
[time=4842] For great is our faithful name.
[time=4852] I still remember.
[time=4856] The day you saved me.
[time=4858] The day I heard you called up my name.
[time=4864] You said you were me.
[time=4868] And would never leave me.
[time=4870] And I have never been the same.
[time=4876] We will remember.
[time=4884] We will remember the works of your hand.
[time=4890] We will stop and give you praise.
[time=4894] For great is our faithful name.
[time=4898] Let's sing that again.
[time=4900] We will remember.
[time=4910] The works of your hand.
[time=4914] We will stop and give you praise.
[time=4920] For great is our faithful name.
[time=4926] [AMEN]
[time=4934] Well, here's how we're going to close this morning.
[time=4942] Kelly asked like we did last week.
[time=4944] If any of the elders and staff members are around, please come forward.
[time=4948] And any of you that might like an elder or staff member to pray with you this morning and encourage you that way before you leave.
[time=4954] We want to just let you know that we're going to have them down front and leave some time to do that.
[time=4958] Let me close this in prayer and then you are dismissed.
[time=4962] God, I pray that we would not be a people that forget the work of your hands.
[time=4968] I pray that we would not be a people who forget your faithfulness, but God that you would remind us every day and that you would remind us every week about your amazing love, that you would remind us about your amazing character.
[time=4986] God, that we would be a people that know you better and understand who you are better. God, that we would live like you lived
[time=4994] when you came to this earth 2,000 years ago.
[time=4998] God, I pray blessing on all the people here so that you would help them to go and be light to the world around them.
[time=5004] God, that we would be a people that do it for no other reason than that others may see your glory and see your kingdom come here on earth
[time=5014] as it is in heaven. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=5018] You are dismissed.
