[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age.

[time=506] [MUSIC]
[time=516] Like a drama unfolded, the curtain was opened, while an audience of angels was holding its breath.
[time=525] Since it's a major to travel on strangers, the stage was finally set.
[time=534] Angels folded their wings, and the throne worshiping is God whispered, "I love you, my son."
[time=543] Jesus took off his crown, and lay it down, he said, "Father, I will be done."
[time=553] [MUSIC]
[time=557] It's time to now come, for God's only son, to be born as a light in a dark, lonely place.
[time=566] So we step from heaven's heart, to Bethlehem's star, and a star that is new, always.
[time=577] When God comes to keep up with gladness and tears, and the trumpets and the horns and the strings,
[time=585] and the trumpets and the wise men, and all of them, and all of angels to sing.
[time=594] And fill the sky with diversity.
[time=608] Joy to the Lord, praise to the King, all in His name.
[time=615] Joy to the Lord, worship and sing.
[time=622] Jesus has come to bring joy.
[time=625] Joy to the Lord, to the Lord.
[time=633] Joy to the Lord, worship and sing.
[time=640] Jesus has come to bring joy.
[time=643] Joy to the Lord.
[time=649] Joy to the Lord, to the Lord, to the Lord.
[time=658] Jesus has come to bring joy.
[time=662] Joy to the Lord, to the Lord.
[time=667] Oh, let it bring joy, joy to the Lord.
[time=676] Jesus has come to bring joy.
[time=686] Well, good morning.
[time=699] It's good to be with you.
[time=700] I'm so thankful that you're all here, and I am so grateful to be able to begin this morning with you, a journey over these next several Sundays as we look at, consider and give some thought to the symbols, some of the classic symbols of Christmas.
[time=715] And this morning we come to, as you've already heard, we come to angels.
[time=719] Angels, my friends.
[time=720] What comes to your mind?
[time=721] What do you think about?
[time=722] What do you envision when you think of, or you hear us speak to the issue of angels from Jimmy Stewart, and it's a wonderful life to Nicholas Cage and City of Angels.
[time=735] Hollywood has, as well as Madison Avenue.
[time=738] They've tried to, for years, kind of capture our imagination with pictures and ideas of what they look like, and what they're up to, and what they really do.
[time=747] And I just think it's so important that we take some time this morning as we come to a season where you'll see them everywhere.
[time=755] You'll see them on top of your tree.
[time=757] You'll see them in the store.
[time=758] Little kids will dress up like them.
[time=760] We'll hear songs about them.
[time=762] Advertisements with them, angels, angels, angels, and I want to make sure that we have a good, solid understanding of what the Scriptures teach us about this great symbol.
[time=775] Angels and Christmas.
[time=777] Well, what are they?
[time=778] If you've got a pen, pencil something to write with, just take a few notes down this morning as we make our way through this.
[time=785] I'm going to just do my best to look with you at the Scriptures and gain some insights and understandings as to how it is that God designed them and what it is they do.
[time=795] Let me start by saying this.
[time=796] What are they?
[time=797] Angels are spirits.
[time=799] Write that down.
[time=800] Angels are spirits.
[time=801] They are supernatural, celestial, or heavenly beings.
[time=806] They are majestic and faithful messengers of God.
[time=810] Mitch referred to that, the drama gave testimony to that.
[time=814] Messengers of God.
[time=816] The Greek word there is angolos.
[time=819] Angolos means messenger to carry a specific message.
[time=824] Angels are celestial beings created by God.
[time=829] God created angels to execute and carry out His will.
[time=834] Spiritual beings created by God.
[time=838] Now look with me at Psalm 148.
[time=840] Psalm 148 verse 2.
[time=843] Psalm 148.
[time=848] Psalm 148 2 and verse 5 and verse 6.
[time=853] Praise Him all His angels, the psalmist says.
[time=856] Praise Him all His angels.
[time=858] Praise Him all His hosts.
[time=860] Let them praise the name of the Lord, verse 5.
[time=863] For He the Lord commanded and they the angels were created.
[time=868] He has also established them forever and ever.
[time=871] He has made a decree which will not pass away.
[time=875] Angels brought into existence by the creating power of God, the word of God.
[time=881] Colossians 1.
[time=882] Go to Colossians 1, 15.
[time=885] Go to Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians.
[time=888] Go to Colossians chapter 1.
[time=891] Here it talks about the incomparable Christ.
[time=895] Here we're talking about the Lord Himself and all that He has accomplished and all that He has done.
[time=900] Paul here in the letter to the church at Colosses says in verse 15, "He, referring to the Lord Himself, He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[time=912] For by Him all things were created both in the heavens and on earth,
[time=918] invisible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities.
[time=924] All things have been created through Him and for Him." Angels, Angolos, messengers of God, spirit beings, uniquely created by God.
[time=938] And look what it says in Hebrews 1, 14, to execute His will.
[time=942] We talked about that.
[time=943] Angels developed made to execute His will.
[time=946] It says in Hebrews 1, 14, "Are they referring to angels?
[time=949] Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to render service
[time=955] for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?" They are referred to as sons of God in Genesis 6.
[time=965] They are referred to as heavenly beings in Psalm 29.
[time=968] They are referred to as holy ones in Psalm 89 and as heavenly hosts
[time=974] in that famous Luke 2 passage that was already read this morning.
[time=979] They were created by God before earth.
[time=984] Make a note of that.
[time=986] Before the earth was created, before man was created, before any of this was here,
[time=992] before we were here, before the human race is created by God.
[time=996] Long before then, angels existed with Him.
[time=1000] We see reference to this back in Job 38.
[time=1004] Go back to Job just before the book of Psalms.
[time=1007] You'll have the book of Job, the story of Job.
[time=1009] Go to Job 38 verses 1 to 7.
[time=1013] Angels in existence even before man or the earth.
[time=1017] Job 38 1 to 7.
[time=1019] We could just read 7, but I just love reading 1 through 7.
[time=1022] It's almost a separate message, if you will, this morning we're talking about angels.
[time=1028] But I would encourage anybody here this morning.
[time=1031] If ever you're like me, if ever you would be tempted to argue with God,
[time=1042] if ever you'd be tempted to think that down deep inside God got it right most of the time, but on this one God kind of messed up.
[time=1050] If ever in light of what you might be facing or in light of what you might be going through, ever there is that thought that if you had your way, you know, if you were given the reins for just a moment, you could make all things right because you're so insightful.
[time=1065] I mean, there's times we start thinking these ways.
[time=1067] There's times we start feeling as if somehow God missed one.
[time=1071] And though that has nothing to do with angels, I just, it's what's going on here in Job 38.
[time=1075] And at the end of this passage, he references them.
[time=1078] But let me just read the whole thing to you.
[time=1080] Then the Lord answered Job.
[time=1081] Job, Job had been through a great deal.
[time=1083] And Job had come to a point where he finally kind of lashed out at God, wishing things had gone differently, demanding that things go differently, wondering what in the world God was doing as he allowed certain things to happen.
[time=1096] Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, "Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?"
[time=1106] Now gird up your loins like a man, and I will ask you, and you, Job, instruct me, God.
[time=1114] Can you imagine God saying that to you?
[time=1119] You want to be in charge?
[time=1121] You think you've got this all figured out, okay, you, you instruct me.
[time=1125] Where were you, verse four?
[time=1126] Where were you, God says?
[time=1128] When I laid the foundation of the earth, tell me, if you have understanding,
[time=1134] who set its measurements since you know, or who stretched the line on it,
[time=1140] the earth?
[time=1141] On what were its bases sunk?
[time=1144] Or who laid its cornerstone when, verse seven, here you go, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.
[time=1156] As God does his creation work, the sons of God, the angels are already present,
[time=1162] shouting for joy.
[time=1165] Being spirits, angels can function as mediators or go-betweens between God and man.
[time=1172] Something else to remember here, they can pass back and forth.
[time=1176] Angels have the capacity, being spirit beings, they can move back and forth
[time=1182] from the spiritual realm to the physical realm at will, unimpeded by any physical boundaries.
[time=1188] There is example after example after example of this one for you.
[time=1194] You can write down Acts 12.
[time=1196] Acts 12, verses six and seven.
[time=1201] Peter has faithfully done what God called him to do.
[time=1204] Peter has been proclaiming the gospel.
[time=1207] Peter has boldly and with great courage, continued to speak what was true and right, and now for doing that he finds himself in prison.
[time=1215] So here he is in prison, on the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward,
[time=1221] Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and guards in front of the door
[time=1228] were watching over the prison.
[time=1230] So in the midst of that physical setting, here's what takes place, verse 12 we see, or verse seven, excuse me, and behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appears,
[time=1241] in a light shown in the cell and he struck Peter's side and woke him up saying, get up quickly and his chains fell off his hands.
[time=1251] He struck him, says, struck him on his side, woke him up.
[time=1255] He appears there in the cell, able to move back and forth between the spiritual and the physical,
[time=1261] unimpeded by any physical boundaries.
[time=1265] Lots of insights to find on angels, some other insights I found this week.
[time=1270] As I read a number of different sources, one was a book by Fred Dickison called Angels Good and Evil.
[time=1276] He says, though angels consistently appeared in human form to help warn or encourage,
[time=1282] there's the ongolose, there's the messenger, though they often appeared in human form to help warn or encourage.
[time=1290] Interesting note here, there is no biblical record showing that an angel ever appeared to a wicked or evil person
[time=1297] or warned such a one of impending danger.
[time=1301] Good, godly angels always appeared to god honoring people.
[time=1306] Abraham, Moses, David, Daniel, Jesus, Peter, Paul, and others.
[time=1311] As Christ identified himself with man in flesh and blood, so angels have in time,
[time=1319] identified themselves with man in form, language, and deed during brief visits.
[time=1324] Many times angels were so disguised as men that they were not at first identified as angels.
[time=1331] Abraham entertained three men, the scriptures teach.
[time=1335] Abraham entertained three men as dinner guests, one remained to talk with him, while the other two angels went down to Sodom and spent the night there with Lot who thought they were men as well.
[time=1347] Referring to this incident with Abraham and Lot and the angels and Sodom,
[time=1353] the writer of Hebrews in Hebrews 13-2, you could write that down, the writer of Hebrews in Hebrews 13-2 says that you and I are to show hospitality to strangers, that's right.
[time=1365] He says you and I are to show hospitality to strangers for in doing so some have entertained, what?
[time=1373] Angels, unaware.
[time=1379] You stop and think about that. I mean, whether you've shown hospitality to a stranger
[time=1385] or whether you've encountered someone along the way, you just think back and you wonder, you wonder how many times in your life, I wonder how many times in mine,
[time=1396] and we'll see more as we study here that will bring great light to this, you wonder how many times they've been there, you wonder how many times we've encountered them, you wonder just how many times they've been right there with you and you probably just didn't know it.
[time=1415] Just before Joshua attacks Jericho, a man stood before him with his drawn sword in his hand,
[time=1422] an angel of God sent to support Joshua in his endeavor. Gideon did not know that his reassuring guest was an angel
[time=1431] until he had served him a meal of lamb cakes and broth, and the angel there in Judges 6 made a burnt offering
[time=1438] of the food that had been given him. The angel of the Lord made several appearances as a man to Manoa and his wife in Judges 13.
[time=1447] Occasionally in the Scriptures, as you read through here, angels are displayed themselves as men with awesome appearances
[time=1457] and great countenance. Women at the tomb, you'll remember, in Luke 24 when Jesus had conquered death
[time=1465] and when the tomb was empty there, they reported two men, the women did, they reported two men who stood by them in dazzling apparel.
[time=1473] As the twelve disciples witnessed Jesus' ascension, as time comes and Jesus leaves the disciples
[time=1480] and He ascends into heaven to be with the Father, it says that there were two men who stood by them in white robes.
[time=1487] An amazing description of an angel was given by Daniel, who saw this angel while standing on the banks of the Tigris.
[time=1494] He says, "And behold, a man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with the gold of Yufaz. His body was like dark yellow,
[time=1503] his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam
[time=1510] of burnished bronze and the sound of his words like the noise of a multitude."
[time=1518] Genesis 31, you don't have to turn there, but that's where we initially learn about angels and their creation.
[time=1527] It says in Genesis 131 that angels were originally created holy and pure.
[time=1534] It's important for you to know this.
[time=1536] There exists today faithful righteous angels and there exists today those that are not faithful, those who are evil.
[time=1546] This isn't how it began.
[time=1548] In Genesis 1, 31 sheds light on the fact that all angels, all of these special beings, these spiritual beings were created holy
[time=1557] and pure and that like men they were given a choice in attitude and action.
[time=1563] Some, like men, some chose to honor God, some chose to worship God, some chose loyal service to the God that had created them
[time=1575] and others led by the once favored angel Lucifer, while others led by Lucifer rebelled.
[time=1584] And we're literally, literally ejected, if you will, literally tossed out of heaven.
[time=1593] You read about that in a number of places, but let's look at Revelation 12, if you will.
[time=1598] After the back of your Bible, the last book there in the New Testament, go to Revelation 12.
[time=1611] Lucifer leads the charge and the unfaithful and righteous band of angels attempts to rebel.
[time=1618] It says in Revelation 12 verse 7 it says, "And there was war in heaven."
[time=1624] Why is that? And there was at that time there was war in heaven.
[time=1629] Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon, the dragon and his angels waged war.
[time=1638] And they were not strong enough and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.
[time=1644] You see, their rebellion and their sin caused them to lose the one thing they had enjoyed for so long, which was fellowship.
[time=1652] A place in the presence of God, a place close to him.
[time=1657] It says in the great verse 9 it says, "And the great dragon was thrown down.
[time=1664] The serpent of old who was called the devil and Satan who deceives the whole world.
[time=1670] He was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him."
[time=1678] And so that was a time when all of a sudden there was this division.
[time=1682] There began at that point to be a legion of those that functioned under the rule and guidance of Satan
[time=1689] and there continued to be a faithful following that continued to serve and humbly come alongside
[time=1696] and give themselves to all of the Lord's efforts.
[time=1699] And I want to just show you a few things Mitch mentioned in his intro, how they guard and they guide and he's absolutely right.
[time=1705] As I studied this week and as we've looked into this in recent days, we realize that the Bible is just filled with descriptions of differing objectives, different ways in which they gave themselves
[time=1717] and continue, we believe, to give themselves to God's service.
[time=1721] What specifically do they do? Just write a few things down here as we make our way through this.
[time=1726] Number one, you see clearly in scriptures that angels have always announced and warned.
[time=1732] Angels have always announced and warned.
[time=1736] The births of certain select servants of God were announced by angels.
[time=1741] Isaac's birth was announced by an angel of God.
[time=1745] Samson's birth was announced as we saw earlier in the drama.
[time=1749] John the Baptist's birth was announced.
[time=1752] Jesus himself, his birth, announced by an angel of God.
[time=1756] As for warnings, there were many. Abraham and Lot were warned of the impending destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1763] Joseph, Joseph and Mary, the mother and father, they're of Jesus soon after he's born.
[time=1770] Joseph is warned by an angel to take Jesus, the Christ child, to where?
[time=1775] To Egypt? To flee and to move away from the impending persecution that was going to come against small boys?
[time=1783] Gabriel and a dream warns Daniel of all the concerns and all that will take place in the end times.
[time=1789] They announced and they warned.
[time=1791] They guided and they instructed. Write that down.
[time=1794] Angels have guided and they have instructed over time.
[time=1798] From the time the guidance thing, just remember this, from the time Abraham left Ur.
[time=1803] From the time Abraham, the original father of the nation of Israel, from the time that God prompted him and promised him and began to move him on his journey toward this great promised land.
[time=1816] From the time Abraham left Ur, if you just kind of track from that point on,
[time=1822] all the way through, all that they experienced, all that they saw, the places that they went.
[time=1828] If you just track the journey of the people of Israel, God's chosen people, all the way to the time where Joshua takes them across the river
[time=1837] and they plant themselves there in Canaan.
[time=1840] When they finally get there, if you just take from Abraham leaving Ur to Joshua, bringing them across the river, you see years and years and years and years of the angel of God guiding them,
[time=1855] the angel of God moving them, the angel of God going before them, the angel of God coming behind them.
[time=1863] And guiding is something we see specifically in the great story of God's people.
[time=1869] When Moses led them out of Egypt specifically in Exodus 23, 20, it says the angel of the Lord went before them and behind them.
[time=1877] And as for instruction, there are many places where we see angels giving instruction.
[time=1883] I thought it was so interesting this week to be reminded of the fact that Stephen says in Acts 7, Stephen, in his sermon, in his speech there where he kind of gives the history of all that the people of God had been through.
[time=1897] They were getting ready to kill Stephen, but before they kill him, he reminds them of all that God had done.
[time=1903] And in his reminding them in Acts 7, it's interesting, he reminds them that on Mount Sinai where Moses received probably the great...
[time=1912] If you want to talk about a great instruction, if you want to talk about a body of material that's delivered
[time=1918] and the instruction that came with that body of material, I would refer you to the law.
[time=1924] And when Moses receives the law on Mount Sinai, Stephen reminds us in Acts 7 that it was angels who brought that law, who delivered that.
[time=1935] They announce, they warn, angels guide and instruct.
[time=1940] Everybody, if you got a Bible, everybody turned to Psalm 34-7, if you would.
[time=1945] I just want to remind you of this. This is something that a lot of people talk about often.
[time=1950] Sometimes we talk about it a little, maybe a little on the flip inside.
[time=1955] We're a little quick sometimes, I think, in our reference to this. I understand, but I want to just come back this morning.
[time=1961] And I want to just remind you that though some might consider it folklore or wives' tales, the fact of the matter is there are angels that guard.
[time=1972] There are guardian, if you want to use that word, you can. There are guardian angels, and it's a very biblical concept.
[time=1980] And I want you to look at what it says in Psalm 34-7, the angel of the Lord. Look at that.
[time=1985] The angel of the Lord in camps. That word in camps means my friends. It means to surround.
[time=1992] It's a surrounding that's done in order to protect. It's a very caring word. It's a very soft and gentle word.
[time=2000] It's a word that carries with it great love and devotion. The angel of the Lord lovingly surrounds.
[time=2006] He encamps, it says, around those who fear Him and rescues them.
[time=2015] Now I want you to think about that. The angel of the Lord, it says, encamps around you.
[time=2021] If you hear this morning and you know Him, if you hear this morning and you love Him, if you hear this morning and you fear Him as we do, those of us that know Him.
[time=2032] He says He has encamped and circled around you angels to care for and rescue you.
[time=2042] It's amazing. I wonder how many times yours has acted. I wonder how many times mine has done His thing.
[time=2060] You ever wonder that? You ever been on your own? You ever been alone in a situation and just out of nowhere felt ministered to, cared for?
[time=2074] I don't know, nudged in a different direction. It might sound about out there to some.
[time=2079] It's just amazing for me this week to read again that the angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him and He rescues them.
[time=2089] They announce and they warn. They guide and instruct. They guard and defend. They minister. Write this down.
[time=2094] It's kind of the same point, just saying it different. They minister to people's needs.
[time=2098] All angelic service to man is ministry in some form to man's need.
[time=2104] Angels are messengers of God's love. They are messengers. They carry a message of goodwill, protection and ministry.
[time=2113] And their mission is always to help in an immediate or ultimate sense as God sends them to come alongside the needs of mankind.
[time=2125] Another interesting note for you this morning. Just remember this, mankind. Remember this. They come alongside. They minister to the needs of mankind.
[time=2133] Even, even, go to Mark 1, if you will. Go back to the Gospels. Even our Lord. And you say, "Well, wait a minute. Our Lord, I thought you were talking about mankind."
[time=2142] Well, don't forget, my friends. Don't forget that as Jesus comes, we celebrate His birth this season.
[time=2148] And don't forget that as He comes to earth, He takes on human flesh. We've taught you this before. We've talked about this in recent days.
[time=2157] He becomes a hundred percent man. While maintaining one hundred percent of His divinity, He becomes one hundred percent man.
[time=2166] And so, even with our Lord in His humanness, as He faces one of the most challenging and one of the most difficult situations,
[time=2175] probably shy of the crucifixion that He ever encountered in His 33 years, as He goes into the wilderness there to be tempted by the devil.
[time=2185] Look what it says here in Mark 1. Mark 1, 12, "Immediately the Spirit impaled Him to go out into the wilderness."
[time=2192] So there He is out in the middle of nowhere, on His own. And He was in the wilderness for 40 days being tempted by Satan.
[time=2201] And He was with the wild beasts, and who else?
[time=2208] Did you know that? Have you ever seen that there in that verse? Have you been reminded of that great truth in this great story of our Lord?
[time=2217] In the midst of those 40 days, in the midst of... Can you imagine, first of all, can you imagine 40 days of temptation?
[time=2225] So you and I sometimes crack after 30 seconds. Right? Okay, I'll speak for me.
[time=2235] 40 days on His own, tempted by the one who would want nothing more than to see His kingdom ruined and all of His powers gone and all of His ministry depleted.
[time=2250] And out there in the wilderness with wild beasts, the Scriptures say, are angels ministering to Him?
[time=2257] Have you ever felt ministered to in the midst of a temptation?
[time=2262] Have you ever thought about doing something? Really.
[time=2267] Have you ever considered doing something you knew you shouldn't have done?
[time=2272] Have you ever considered making a decision that would move you directly outside the will of God and what you and I know He would want for you?
[time=2281] Have you ever in the midst of being tempted felt ministered to?
[time=2286] We oftentimes, and rightly so, hear me, I think attribute that kind of perception and that experience to the Spirit of God at work in us.
[time=2295] And I think that's fair. I think that's right. I'm also reminded as I read this week, I'm also reminded as I look at the Scriptures that the angels are there ministering to those.
[time=2310] In the midst of temptation, what a thought.
[time=2313] They announce and they warn, they guide and instruct, they guard and defend, they minister to people's needs.
[time=2320] You know, here's one that we don't often think about or connect to the work of angels, but it's so true.
[time=2326] The Bible states it clearly, they assist in judgment.
[time=2331] They assist in God's righteous judgment throughout biblical history.
[time=2339] We see this from the very beginnings back in the Old Testament all the way up into the final judgment.
[time=2346] And my friends, we see angels engaged in carrying out God's divine judgment.
[time=2353] You can look in your Bibles at the book of Acts.
[time=2356] Let's look at just a few of these, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts.
[time=2362] In Acts chapter 12, we've got a guy named Herod, Herod Agrippa, I believe was his name.
[time=2370] And in Acts 12, 23, actually go back up to 22, it says the people kept crying.
[time=2377] Herod had become kind of full of himself, if I can say it that way.
[time=2381] He started to believe the press clippings, if you will.
[time=2384] He had grown so infatuated with his own strength and power.
[time=2388] And he's there holding court and it says on an appointed day, verse 21, Herod, having put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering
[time=2399] and addressed to them.
[time=2400] And the people kept crying out the voice of a God, not a man.
[time=2406] And immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God that glory.
[time=2414] And he was eaten by worms and died.
[time=2419] Angels involved in the divine judgment that God carries out.
[time=2424] Matthew 25, go back to the Gospel of Matthew, if you will.
[time=2428] Here in Matthew 25, our Lord Jesus Himself refers to the end of it all.
[time=2434] We'll go back to Revelation and look at it directly.
[time=2437] But let me just show you what the Lord said Himself in Matthew 25, 31, and 32.
[time=2442] Here referring to the judgment that will come someday.
[time=2445] The Lord Jesus says, "But when the Son of Man comes in His glory," verse 31.
[time=2450] And all the what?
[time=2452] And all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.
[time=2457] All the nations will be gathered before Him and He will separate them from one another.
[time=2463] As the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
[time=2467] Angels involved, Jesus referring there to angels and their involvement in the coming judgment
[time=2473] that will take place in the end.
[time=2475] Go with me if you would to the end, go back to Revelation 20.
[time=2479] Revelation 20, here we see some specific involvement.
[time=2485] This is kind of a, it's a chilling scene.
[time=2489] If I can say so myself, Revelation 21 to 3, what a thought here.
[time=2494] This is where Satan is bound for a time.
[time=2497] Then I saw an angel.
[time=2499] Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven holding the key of the abyss and a great chain
[time=2506] in His hand.
[time=2508] And he laid hold of the dragon, sound familiar?
[time=2511] And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan and bound
[time=2517] him for a thousand years and threw him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him
[time=2524] so that he would not deceive the nations any longer.
[time=2529] You realize that's what he's been doing, right?
[time=2531] You realize he has been deceiving the nations.
[time=2536] And there will come a day when he will no longer be able to deceive the nations.
[time=2540] The angel throws him into the abyss.
[time=2543] He seals it until the thousand years were completed.
[time=2548] After these things, he must be released for a short time.
[time=2555] Angels involved in all kinds of things, announcing and warning, guiding and instructing, guarding and defending, ministering to the needs of people, assisting in judgment.
[time=2565] Well, what's the lesson?
[time=2567] We could go on, but let me just stop this right then.
[time=2569] Let me just ask you this morning.
[time=2571] What is the lesson or what are the lessons that we can begin to take from this?
[time=2576] You and I begin to look at the biblical account of who they are and why they were created
[time=2582] and what they do in their service to God.
[time=2585] What are the lessons that we can learn?
[time=2587] The whole discussion of angels is actually packed with application and opportunities for you and I to apply.
[time=2594] Let me just say it to you this way.
[time=2596] Hope you'll write this down.
[time=2597] I hope you'll give some thought to this.
[time=2598] My friends, angels, angels were.
[time=2601] They are today, they always will be.
[time=2606] They are quiet servants.
[time=2609] And I'll just say that again to you, angels are quiet servants.
[time=2615] They are gentle when they need to be.
[time=2619] They take action upon God's direction, but they are by nature quiet servants.
[time=2626] They exist, my friends.
[time=2628] The Scriptures are clear, they exist to please the king without fanfare.
[time=2633] They are humble, obedient, benevolent beings who faithfully serve God and others.
[time=2644] Did you get that?
[time=2645] They are humble, obedient, benevolent, benevolent, meaning kind-hearted beings who faithfully serve
[time=2653] God and others.
[time=2654] They give themselves to guarding and guiding and instructing and ministering to the needs
[time=2660] of others.
[time=2661] They give themselves to all that God has called them to.
[time=2664] And they do it all.
[time=2665] Here's the point this morning.
[time=2666] Here's the one thing I hope you walk away with.
[time=2668] They do all of it as an act of worship.
[time=2676] They were created to serve God and be messengers for His people.
[time=2681] And they do so, they humbly, graciously, faithfully serve, and it's an act of worship.
[time=2690] They make much of God while making little of themselves.
[time=2696] And that's what I want you to see and think about this morning.
[time=2699] And that is what I hope you'll see and think about this Christmas season.
[time=2703] Again, you'll see them everywhere.
[time=2705] And you'll see different depictions of them.
[time=2707] And you'll hear different stories about them and you'll watch movies and they'll make it look like this and that.
[time=2713] But please, this morning, be reminded from the very pages of Scripture.
[time=2717] As you sing about them and as you see the angels view them as humble, faithful worshipers
[time=2724] of God.
[time=2727] They exalt God.
[time=2729] They support what's good.
[time=2730] They magnify God and do so at times with great splendor while other times with great simplicity.
[time=2740] They make much of God by their loyal service to God, humble, majestic, and absolutely utterly
[time=2752] given to the one in whom they serve.
[time=2756] Many, many examples of this, but let me just share this with you.
[time=2758] I don't think there's a greater, more powerful picture of this than what we find in Isaiah
[time=2765] chapter 6.
[time=2766] Would you turn there with me?
[time=2767] Would you go to Isaiah?
[time=2768] Back in the Old Testament, Isaiah, just before you get to Jeremiah, you'll come to Isaiah.
[time=2775] Go to Isaiah chapter 6, if you will.
[time=2777] What a picture.
[time=2778] What an amazing picture God's word paints for us here this morning of a very special angel,
[time=2785] a very, very special group of angels called the seraphim.
[time=2789] Isaiah chapter 6 verses 1 to 4, it's an interesting passage, it's a great passage.
[time=2798] Let me say this to you, in Isaiah 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, first five chapters of Isaiah, Isaiah
[time=2804] does, he gives himself to what prophets do.
[time=2807] He prophesies, God gives him words to speak to the people of Israel and as he speaks the
[time=2813] prophecies in the first five chapters of Isaiah, he comes to the sixth chapter and
[time=2819] here at the beginning of chapter 6 he pauses and he gives you and I a very real insight into this unbelievable experience where he was called.
[time=2830] We kind of back up here at the beginning of 6 and we get a view into this amazing event
[time=2836] where God called him to be a prophet.
[time=2841] And what's involved is just, it's incredible, I'll just read this to you.
[time=2844] In the year of King Uzziah, Isaiah 6, 1 to 4, in the year of King Uzziah's death, Isaiah,
[time=2853] I saw the Lord, just try that one on for size, right there.
[time=2858] I saw the Lord, he says, sitting on a throne lofty and exalted with the train of his robe
[time=2869] filling the temple, seraphim, there you go, angels, special angels, seraphim stood above
[time=2875] him, each having six wings, with two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet
[time=2883] and with two he flew and one called out to another.
[time=2889] Some will say in the Hebrew that's a singing, some will say it's just a speaking but either way they are proclaiming to each other and they say holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[time=2903] You see that, the Lord of what?
[time=2905] The Lord of hosts.
[time=2907] The whole earth is full of his glory and the foundations, as the seraphim proclaim this,
[time=2915] it says the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out
[time=2921] while the temple was filling with smoke.
[time=2926] He takes us back here in these first four verses to a very real vision that he experiences
[time=2933] in which he sees the Lord and the angelic beings that serve the Lord and they were referred
[time=2939] to as seraphim.
[time=2940] Seraphim are a special order of angels designed for a very special purpose.
[time=2947] They resemble the four living creatures in Revelation 4.
[time=2950] Let me read that to you while we're thinking about it, just go back again, we're kind of flipping around a lot today but bear with me.
[time=2957] Go back to, I want you to read this, I want you to see this, Revelation 4, same thing going on here, the seraphim of Isaiah 6 very much the same thing as the living, the four living
[time=2968] creatures in Revelation 4, says in Revelation 4, verse 6, and before the throne, Revelation
[time=2982] 4, 6, and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass like crystal and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
[time=2992] The first creature was like a lion and the second creature like a calf and the third creature
[time=2998] had a face like that of a man and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.
[time=3004] And the four living creatures, each of them having six wings, are full of eyes around
[time=3010] and within and day and night they do not cease to proclaim, holy, holy, holy is the Lord
[time=3019] God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.
[time=3024] And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne to Him who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on
[time=3036] the throne and will worship Him who lives forever and ever and will cast their crowns before the throne saying worthy are you our Lord and our God to receive glory and honor
[time=3048] and power for you created all things and because of your will they exist and were created.
[time=3057] Living creatures, seraphim my friend, designed in a unique way to give great glory and honor
[time=3064] to God.
[time=3065] Let me show you this, six wings, think about this, all right?
[time=3070] Six wings as they hover there above the throne in service to their God they have six wings,
[time=3076] two wings covered their face, why do you think two wings are covering their faces as they
[time=3085] hover there in the presence of God serving Him, two wings covering faces, why?
[time=3093] Because you wouldn't, you wouldn't and they wouldn't, we wouldn't dare look.
[time=3099] We wouldn't be able to in the first place, whether they're able to or not, I'm not sure I just know they didn't, they didn't dare look at the glory of God.
[time=3110] They didn't dare eyeball God in respect and utter admiration, they cover their face in
[time=3119] great respect to the one they serve, two wings cover their face, with two they cover their feet, right?
[time=3127] Two of the wings are covering their feet as they hover there in the presence of God, why is it do you think that they cover their feet?
[time=3137] Well, let me ask you this, what do you do, what do you do if you're out in the mud in
[time=3144] your boots and you take a break and you come into the house, a house full of white carpet,
[time=3150] what do you do if you're above the age of 13, what do you do?
[time=3156] If you're below the age of 13, I know what you do, very aware of that, thank you.
[time=3162] But what do you do with those muddy boots in the white carpet, huh?
[time=3167] You take them off because you wouldn't, you wouldn't dare soil holy ground.
[time=3178] You wouldn't dare defile with your feet and your mud and your dirt, the holy one and
[time=3189] his abode and so they, with two wings cover their face and with two wings they cover their feet and with two wings they flew in devoted service to the one on the throne.
[time=3203] Humble, gracious, majestic beings designed by God to care for, to love, to come alongside,
[time=3211] to warn, to guide and they do all of it as an act of worship.
[time=3218] Six wings, it was interesting as I read this week, I just wrote this down, six wings, if you go back over that covering their face, covering their feet, flying in devoted service to the one on the throne, six wings, each of them engaged in a separate act of worship
[time=3235] and the seraphim themselves proclaiming those great words, holy, holy, holy is the Lord
[time=3244] of hosts.
[time=3247] What a privilege we have, my friends.
[time=3252] What a privilege you and I have this morning to consider these created beings who give
[time=3260] themselves with such humility.
[time=3263] One thing I love about angels and I know there are some times where they take on human form, I realize that, but in general one of the things I find so encouraging and so refreshing
[time=3274] about angels as we read all that and as I study that this week I'm reminded that there is no, there's rarely, if any, credit given, I mean we don't see them, right?
[time=3285] They're just quietly doing their thing, serving God and protecting you and doing his bidding.
[time=3292] We live in a day where so many times what we do tends to get recognized or when we do
[time=3299] serve, we want it to be noticed and yet they provide you and I with this really sweet example
[time=3305] and picture of quiet, humble, faithful service.
[time=3312] And I love what they do there in Isaiah 6 and I'm going to invite you this morning to do the very same thing.
[time=3317] I'm going to give you an opportunity.
[time=3319] I hope you'll stay and just take a few more minutes here and as a family, as a congregation,
[time=3325] as Corbin comes, I want to just invite you to respond this morning.
[time=3329] You get a chance to respond to God, to sing out to Him, to proclaim as the angels proclaimed.
[time=3337] And you know one of the great things about this morning, I'm so very thankful for Sarah.
[time=3342] This is Sarah Stole and Sarah this morning has, she's brought an offering.
[time=3352] She has quietly and humbly with the gifts that God has given her.
[time=3360] Just like the gifts that God gave you, there aren't many of you I would ask to come up and paint.
[time=3365] In fact, as I look at the room there aren't any, I don't think.
[time=3370] But I'll tell you what, you've got your gift.
[time=3374] You've been divinely enabled by God.
[time=3377] You've been given spiritual gifts to use and when you use them, the body of Christ is
[time=3383] built up and God receives glory.
[time=3387] And I'm so thankful that she came this morning and you can say, "Well, she painted a picture of an angel." I would say she did.
[time=3395] I would agree with that.
[time=3396] But even more than that my friends, what she did there was an act of worship to her God.
[time=3404] And you and I have the privilege in the coming days this week to give God our worship in
[time=3412] a number of different ways.
[time=3413] And I want to encourage you to do so in the way that you live and the way that you choose and the way that you exercise your gift.
[time=3421] Would you just quietly stand with me this morning and as you stand, let me just pray this prayer and this is not a dismissal prayer, this is just a prayer that would just hopefully capture our hearts as we prepare to sing one last praise to Him this morning.
[time=3437] Father, God, thank you.
[time=3439] Thank you for this gathering of folks, many of whom know you, some of whom are on a journey
[time=3447] to better understand who you are and what it's like to live in relationship with you.
[time=3452] Father, God, we are blessed to be able to be here and we are so grateful for what we see
[time=3459] today about angels, these unique, created beings, God that you designed to serve you
[time=3465] and others.
[time=3467] And I pray, Father, that as we think about that this morning, that we would just be moved in our spirits, God stirred to offer you that same kind of humble, quiet, faithful
[time=3478] service.
[time=3479] God, we love you and we praise you this morning in your son's name.
