[time=60] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=68] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=80] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=96] end of the age. Helping seekers find and follow Christ."
[time=126] "All night the stars are brightly shining."
[time=156] It is the night of our dear Savior's world.
[time=167] To hear appeared and the soul found its word, a thrill of hope, the weary world in joy,
[time=197] the voices, the thunder breaks, the new and glorious sun.
[time=214] The enemies of here and the angels are now divine, now night when Christ was born, and I divine,
[time=244] all night divine.
[time=274] Change shall he reign for the same is our brother, and in his name, all oppression shall cease.
[time=290] Sweet hymns of joy, in grateful cards, praise, that all within us, praises all we raise.
[time=303] God of your peace, O here and the angels are now divine, now night when Christ was born,
[time=328] O here and the angels are now divine, all night divine, all night divine.
[time=358] Well this morning we're going to continue in this series that we started last week entitled
[time=383] "The Symbols of Christmas," and I want to just invite you to just as we start with someone
[time=390] that you came with, someone that you're sitting next to, who you know, and if you're sitting next to someone you don't know and they'd rather be left alone, no big deal, just nervously look at them and they can nervously look at you and see if this is going to work, and if it doesn't it's okay, so either on your own I want you to think about or with somebody next to you, and I know this is going to sound really simple, but bear with me, go ahead and give it some thought, what is Christmas really, what is it really, really about, what
[time=419] is Christmas really, fundamentally and foundationally, just think about that and just for a few
[time=426] seconds here, go ahead, what's the phrase that comes to mind, what's the word that comes to mind, what's the message that comes to mind, what's Christmas really about, just talk about it for a moment and we'll come back, go ahead, go, and you can talk loud, you don't have to whisper you can speak up, alright, I hear you, good job, you may have whittled
[time=464] it down to a phrase, you may have kind of come up with a sentence, you may have shared that with somebody, you may have just thought it through in your own heart and mind, as
[time=475] I asked myself this week that question, as most of you would guess, a lot of things came to my mind, I began to write a number of things down on a piece of paper, it got pretty lengthy and I tried to whittle it down, and as I'm trying to whittle it down, what came to my mind was a song, and there's a lot of songs that speak to this issue of the meaning of
[time=496] Christmas, you and I could just list many, but there's one that I want to sing for you,
[time=502] just kidding, there's one that I just, for some reason this song just has always stood
[time=510] out to me, I just love its message, it's not a real old song, it's a little bit newer,
[time=516] but either way I just have found the lyric in this song to be very, very powerful, and when it comes to just from my, if I were answering the question, from my own heart and mind,
[time=527] I wish I could have said it like this, it's so powerful, I believe Michael W. Smith sings it, I believe it was written by Chris Rice, and I want to just, I want you just to, this isn't the whole song, this is just a portion of the song, but I want you to catch, I just want you to catch the meaning here, somebody first hour yelled out, sing it, and I didn't,
[time=547] but you can hum it, if you recognize it, you can almost just hear the tune in your mind, bring your peace into our violence, bid our hungry souls be filled, word Christ, word
[time=562] now breaking heaven's silence, welcome to our world, welcome to our world, fragile fingers
[time=571] sent to heal us, tender brow prepared for thorn, tiny heart whose blood will what save
[time=580] us unto us is born, unto us is born, I love this, so wrap, so wrap our injured flesh around
[time=591] you, what a powerful picture, so wrap our injured flesh around you, breathe our air and
[time=599] walk our side, rob our, what, take it away, rob our sin and make us holy, perfect son
[time=612] of God, perfect son of God.
[time=618] My friends, that is a spectacular, in my opinion, definition of what I believe Christmas is
[time=625] really about, and if I were going to whittle it down to a word, I would say it is about the gospel, it is about the good news, it is the greatest news you or I could have ever
[time=641] received, I believe Christmas is about Emmanuel, God with us, God being willing to come where
[time=650] near to us, and oh did we need him to come near, amen, the gospel.
[time=660] When I say that, when I say that Christmas is fundamentally about the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ and who he was and what he did and what he accomplished and what that means to each and every one of us that knows him, I hope you're able to at least in your mind this morning in your heart, I hope you can just put words to that, I hope you can articulate that in your own soul today.
[time=683] The gospel, he was born, he lived, he died in dying, he forgave us of our sins and redeemed
[time=691] us, he rose from the grave, conquering death for those that know him, the gospel.
[time=698] And to those who fully surrender their hearts and lives to this Lord and Savior, he gives purpose and meaning to life today and the promise of eternal life in the future, the
[time=709] gospel.
[time=710] It's the message of Christmas, this is the greatest news of all, this gospel, this truth
[time=717] about Christ and it is the message I believe of Christmas.
[time=723] Now Mitch and I tried last week to remind you, we tried our best to show you last week and Sarah obviously helped us if you weren't here, what a joy, what a kick, it was just
[time=734] awesome to have her quietly and humbly serving using her gifts over there as we spoke.
[time=741] She paints this picture of our first symbol, the angel and Mitch and I tried our best to
[time=747] remind you that like angels we are messengers, you and I.
[time=752] We are messengers, like it or not, we are carrying a message, each of us carries one
[time=758] and communicates that message everywhere we go, everything we do, every decision we make
[time=765] delivers a message.
[time=768] And I want you to think of it this morning as we continue on here, I want you to think of this message that we deliver, this message that we articulate, wherever we go, whatever we do, I want you to think of it like a noise.
[time=780] We're always, you and I are always making noise, you might be quiet, I might be loud,
[time=786] but either way, wherever we go, we're making noise, sometimes it's good noise, sometimes it's not so good.
[time=792] Let me ask you this morning to consider the bell, our symbol this morning, the bell.
[time=799] We see bells everywhere at this time.
[time=802] There are songs written in song about bells, we have all kinds of bells, slave bells and
[time=809] hand bells and big bells, I mean there's just bells everywhere in the Christmas season.
[time=813] And this morning, I got a special bell.
[time=816] I asked for one of those big bell choir bells, I've always dreamed of wearing a white glove on stage and banging one of those big bells, but they couldn't find one for me.
[time=826] So what I got was even better, this is actually the bell that our good friend, the gal that
[time=834] God used years and years ago to really help start, really start and help grow Blackhawk Christian school back 30 whatever years ago, I eat a toffalo.
[time=844] Ms. Toffalo would in those early days, she would recess in the classrooms and there were only a few then, she would ring this bell, this was, I kind of feel like I should have
[time=855] white gloves on now that I'm standing here thinking about it, but this was the bell that I eat it would ring, it's a good bell, I mean it does what bells do, right?
[time=865] It makes noise, noise that reverberates from the stage, into the pew, back to the back,
[time=871] up to the top, it's a bell and this is a great bell and I want you just to think about this this morning, I want you to think about the bell and this message that we send, this noise
[time=883] that we make with our lives, especially at Christmas, I want you to join me in considering
[time=892] this great truth.
[time=893] Very biblical concept, my friends, this idea of the noise, the sound that we make with
[time=901] our lives.
[time=902] Go to 1 Thessalonians, if you will, go to 1 Thessalonians, back there, Pascalations,
[time=912] Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, you'll come to 1 Thessalonians, go to 1 Thessalonians
[time=918] 1, oftentimes when the biblical writers would write to a church, as Paul did this, as Timothy
[time=926] did this, oftentimes they were addressing problematic circumstances, situations where the church in that setting wasn't at all what it needed to be, where people were conducting
[time=937] themselves in ways that were far, far removed from what God had designed.
[time=943] First Thessalonians 1 would not be one of those circumstances.
[time=946] We find in 1 Thessalonians 1, Paul, he's appropriately singing the praises of these people.
[time=954] He had only been in Thessalonica for a short time and yet in that short time, these people had caught, they had taken in the truth and they had now begun to practice it even in his absence.
[time=964] They were doing a really, really good job.
[time=966] They are an exemplary church and as you read 1 Thessalonians 1, it's just amazing to see
[time=972] all that God was allowing them to do, look at what Paul says about them in chapter 1 beginning
[time=978] in verse 5.
[time=979] And would you in honor of God's word, would you stand and let me read this to you.
[time=984] It says in 1 Thessalonians 1, 5, it says, "For our gospel," there it is, "the truth
[time=991] about Jesus, for our gospel did not come to you in word only but also in power and in
[time=998] the Holy Spirit and with full conviction, just as you know what kind of men we proved
[time=1004] to be among you for your sake." You also, watch this, you also became imitators of us and of the Lord.
[time=1012] Having received the word in much tribulation, these people, they received the word in the
[time=1018] midst of great hardship.
[time=1020] Many of you this morning find yourselves in great hardship.
[time=1024] Take courage.
[time=1026] Look what it says here, it says, "They received the word in much tribulation with the joy
[time=1033] of the Holy Spirit, the joy of their circumstance." No, the joy of the Holy Spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in
[time=1042] Macedonia and in Achaia.
[time=1045] For the word here it is, for the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, for the
[time=1052] word of the Lord, you know, all that is true and all that is right.
[time=1058] It says, the word in the Greek literally means to reverberate.
[time=1062] You, your lives, he says, the way you conduct yourselves, the way you minister, the way
[time=1068] you use your gifts, you, the word of truth has sounded forth from you.
[time=1075] Not only in Macedonia, not only in Fort Wayne but also in Achaia, also across the world
[time=1081] and the region, in every place your faith toward God has gone forth so that we have no
[time=1088] need to say anything.
[time=1092] Pray with me, would you, Father, God, as we read that and as we think about this noise
[time=1098] that reverberates from each of us, God, as we think about this season and the opportunity to be messengers, God, the opportunity to carry a message to a world, young and old,
[time=1111] red, yellow, black and white, rich, poor and in between, white collar, blue collar, educated,
[time=1118] uneducated.
[time=1119] God, everywhere we go, in every setting we find ourselves in, there is the opportunity
[time=1125] for us to bring this good news, to be bells that make noise, good noise, noise of truth.
[time=1137] And as we learn about that this morning, God, as we look to the Scriptures and as we give thought to this, we pray, Father, God, that you would guide us and encourage us and convict us and teach us wherever necessary in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1151] You can be seated.
[time=1155] So I hope we're all in agreement that there is a message that sounds forth just to use
[time=1161] the terminology from 1 Thessalonians 1 there.
[time=1164] There is a message that sounds forth from us.
[time=1167] We are messengers.
[time=1168] No getting around it, can't deny it.
[time=1171] We're messengers.
[time=1172] We are bells, if you will, reverberating.
[time=1175] Just put your arms around that, not just that word, but that picture, reverberating.
[time=1181] It's what bells do.
[time=1182] And the bell goes off on the playground, it hits the four-square chord, it goes out to
[time=1188] the kickball game and on to the fence, where who knows what they're doing out there.
[time=1192] But they finally hear it, I mean, and they come.
[time=1195] The sound of the bell, it reverberates.
[time=1197] It goes from here to here to there to there.
[time=1202] When the bell rings on the tower clock, people hear it from miles away.
[time=1206] And there's a clear message that it sends.
[time=1208] It's five o'clock or it's four o'clock, whatever it might be.
[time=1213] Sometimes these messages that we send, sometimes these messages that get reverberated, sometimes
[time=1222] they're really good ones and sometimes they're not so good.
[time=1226] It was a July, it was a July afternoon evening, just this past year.
[time=1234] And I had had a really, really, really, really, really, really bad day.
[time=1244] I had had a really, really bad day, anything that could have gone wrong had gone wrong.
[time=1250] Any nasty email that could have maybe been saved for the next day got sent that day.
[time=1255] There was just bad news, there was confusing news, there were some difficult relationships brewing, and it was just a draining, difficult, frustrating day.
[time=1264] All right, so I hadn't had, I hope I'm being clear here, I hadn't had a good day.
[time=1269] So it's time to go home.
[time=1271] I told our students this one, I've never told you this story, I'm a little nervous, but
[time=1277] I'm already feeling better just getting it out.
[time=1278] So bear with me here, when I'm done with this, you may want me to resign or at least seek therapy, so we'll see how it goes.
[time=1287] Somehow I had Jake with me too, I don't know how all that worked out, but I had Jake with me, my six-year-old son, he's over in the passenger seat and we're heading home.
[time=1294] We're going up Laymeyer, we get to the stoplight at Laymeyer, and as we get to the stoplight
[time=1300] there at Laymeyer, and I wasn't feeling any better, the stress was just kind of climbing, and as I get to the stoplight at Laymeyer, a motorcycle, a guy on a motorcycle, a large
[time=1314] guy on a motorcycle, a big bike, one of those Harleys, one of those big hogs, and he's even
[time=1320] got his gal on the back, and great, no big deal, and he's a big guy, and he's got leather
[time=1327] on, and the leather top is like tank-topish leather, and you can see his very, very, very,
[time=1334] that tell you he's a big guy, big, big arms, and the glasses and the bandana, and he pulls
[time=1341] up as I pull up, and I just, you know, you get to the light at the same time and it's
[time=1349] always this like who's going to go, so I just, you know, I wasn't going to deal with it, so I'm talking to Jake, and I just kind of take my hand, right, I got my hand and I kind of point at him, and I just give him one of these, I just go, you know, just like just go, right, I'm talking to Jake, so I do that, and I'm talking to Jake, talking to Jake, all of a sudden somebody honks at me from behind, which didn't help things, because I'd had a bad day, did I tell you that?
[time=1374] So another honking at me from behind, and as I look up, he's still sitting there, he's just sitting there on his bike, he's looking at me, like waiting, and so do you ever have
[time=1386] those times where you hear this still small voice down deep inside of you that tells you what the right thing is to do?
[time=1393] It's like you ever hear that voice, it just slowly, quietly whispers, do this, and then
[time=1400] do you ever just not listen to that voice in your frustration and sin and fleshly indulgence
[time=1406] you just run away from that voice and you do the wrong thing.
[time=1409] So I did the wrong thing, they didn't want to listen, and so I, either honking at me
[time=1415] from the back, I'm looking up, Jake's right here, he's looking at me, now he's staring at me, now he's glaring at me, and so I take my hand and I point at him and I just give him one of these, go, like that, like I'm trying to be nice, right, I'm trying to be nice,
[time=1432] I'm trying to be nice, and I point at the guy and I wave him and I say go, and so honk
[time=1440] again from the back, now the blood's just boiling and now he takes his glasses, he has
[time=1446] a moved inch, takes his glasses, puts his glasses down on his nose and he yells at me,
[time=1453] I was trying to be nice, the cycle dude yells at me, I'm in my car with music playing and
[time=1460] I can hear him, he is so loud and he says to me with his finger wagging in my face across
[time=1466] the intersection, he says, what are you doing?
[time=1473] Little small voice again, blue right past it, I unlock my door, ah see I knew you'd do
[time=1480] that, I'm so sorry, this must be terribly embarrassing for you, maybe I should just quit right now, so I unlock my door and I just get out on the, you know the sideboard, you
[time=1491] know that you step up on, I just get out on the sideboard and I just kind of stand up outside my car, because I was trying to be nice and I yell, now I'm out of my car standing
[time=1502] up on the sideboard, kind of leaning on my front window shield and he says, what are you doing, he says, and I said to him, I'm trying to let you go and I'm yelling back at him and then I see his hands, like gripping his bike handle, deals and his muscles are
[time=1520] just rippling up his arm and my life just starts to pass before me, I think gosh and
[time=1527] then it hits me, okay then, okay there I hit the limit and I'm like, there's my five of my six year old sons in the car like this and I just think, oh my goodness, I went too
[time=1541] far, boy did I go too far and then he drive and then all, so I do all that, so then he
[time=1547] drives, he hits it in gear, he and the gal take off, they wave at me as they go by, they're
[time=1555] honking at me from the back and I utterly and completely failed, I thought, I thought
[time=1564] about it, it felt good to get that out, thank you, I thought about it for months, I thought
[time=1570] gee you know and maybe you've thought about things for months, maybe you've thought at times quite give anything to be able to do that one over again, I thought gosh I wonder
[time=1581] if that cycle dude ever watches TV on Sunday morning at seven, I thought boy if he ever
[time=1588] you know if he ever does, I hope I somehow get a chance someday to just say I'm sorry, that was a clear message, it was a clear message that day, the message was I'm an idiot, I
[time=1601] just right there, we just rang it as loud as I could and sometimes the message is that we ring, sometimes what gets communicated, it's not so good and if ever my friends there
[time=1612] was a time when we'd want our message to ring out with encouragement and truth, it's
[time=1620] at Christmas, I want you to think with me this morning about all the bells, all the
[time=1626] opportunities at Christmas that you and I have and remember the message of Christmas, the gospel, the good news, that God came near to seek and to save those who were lost and
[time=1639] I want you to see this morning, we could have done this eight ways, we could have done this fifteen ways, I want you to see in four very practical clear ways this morning how you
[time=1648] and I can ring bells, how we can ring the message of the gospel to those around us at
[time=1657] this very special time of year, I want to show you four very practical ways that you and I can carry how we can how we can articulate the message, you can view it as angels, you
[time=1667] can view it as bells either way, we get the chance to carry the message of Christ, Christmas
[time=1674] bells ring, not I'm idiot bells but Christmas bells, the bells of the gospel, they ring loud
[time=1683] and clear at this time of year, they ring the truth about Jesus, they ring and people
[time=1689] hear them and people see them and the message of Christmas gets communicated and I want to
[time=1695] show you how that happens when we serve, when we worship, when we proclaim and when we give,
[time=1702] those four things, so if you got a pen just write a few of these things down here, number one the Christmas bells ring when we serve, would you write that down, my friends the message of Christmas, the gospel, the good news of Christ, it comes through loud and clear,
[time=1718] that bell it rings when we, you and I, when we serve, look at Mark 1045, would you write
[time=1725] that down, Mark 1045, and it's just so fundamental to who this baby that's born in the manger,
[time=1732] this Christ child who comes, when you think about him coming, when you think about Emmanuel, God with us, it's just so clear throughout the scriptures as to why he came and it says
[time=1743] it right here in Mark 1045, for even the son of man Christ himself did not come to be served
[time=1751] but to what, but to serve, for the son of man did not come to be served but to serve
[time=1758] and to give his life, not to hold on to his life, not to hoard his life, not to accumulate,
[time=1765] but to give his life away a ransom for many, think about it my friends, if ever there was
[time=1772] a time of year when we should be reminded of the life changing power of serving others
[time=1778] it would be Christmas.
[time=1782] He did not come to, think about the, think about Christmas, think about the way in which the culture has, has moved on this thing.
[time=1790] He did not come to get though we see getting, we hear about getting everywhere we go, it's
[time=1798] all about what's going to be gotten, he didn't come to get, but he came to what, to give,
[time=1805] not to be served but to serve, to serve, to serve my friends, to let go, to meet a need,
[time=1814] a small need, a tiny little thing that most would never even know you gave yourself to,
[time=1820] a significant need that could play a significant role in someone's heart and life.
[time=1828] You're a messenger, you're a bell, and I'm encouraging you this morning to ring that
[time=1834] message of service loud and clear.
[time=1839] I want you to think about it, I want you to think about where you'll be, you know what, I want you to think about before you leave this place today.
[time=1848] I want you to think about, in fact, here's what I'll tell you on this, months, probably in this last year, months and months ago, I'd say maybe nine, ten, eleven months ago, I began to just pray and ask God on a regular basis, let me just underline, on a regular
[time=1863] basis, I was encouraged to begin to pray and to begin to ask God specifically to give
[time=1870] me sight that I didn't used to have, to give me vision that I lacked, to give me an awareness
[time=1878] in circumstances that I used to be without, I begged him to help me go through the every minute of my day with eyes and vision that would see the needs of others.
[time=1891] I begged him and I would do it in the morning and I would do it during the day and I would do it at night asking God to please help me see people and opportunities with vision
[time=1901] that would seek to and want to be willing to serve them, not be served.
[time=1907] And I'll tell you this, you know what he does, if any of you in this room, students, young adults, moms and dads, senior adults, doesn't matter who you are, if any of you would be willing to on a regular basis, pray that prayer, oh God, give me eyes to see opportunities
[time=1923] to serve.
[time=1926] One of the first things you'll realize is how selfish you've been.
[time=1934] Now the first things you'll see and begin to identify is how closed-minded and how self-centered
[time=1945] it is that you and I have walked through, we have walked through life with blinders on
[time=1952] and you don't ever realize it until you really begin to beg God to open your eyes to the needs that are right next to you.
[time=1961] That's why I was going to say, before you leave this place today, I bet if it was on your heart today, before you leave this place, I bet you could serve somebody, somehow, someway,
[time=1973] who will you be with today, where will you be tonight, what's on the docket for tomorrow,
[time=1979] what's your week look like and could you begin to right now ask God to give you, especially
[time=1985] at this time of year where we celebrate the one who came to serve, could you begin to think of ways practically that you could, that you and your family could, that you and some friends could serve, let go of your own agenda, let go of your own idea, let go of
[time=2000] your own schedule and go and do something.
[time=2003] Maybe it's ten minutes, maybe it's three hours, but we serve, we ring a very loud bell
[time=2011] that has a very clear message about Christ when we give ourselves away, we're bells wanting
[time=2017] to sound forth the message of Christmas and Christmas bells ring when we serve, secondly
[time=2025] when we worship, would you write that down?
[time=2029] When we worship, Christmas bells ring when we worship.
[time=2032] Now I want to make sure you understand this, that I'm very clear on this, we've talked about this before in this setting, Corbin mentioned it just a few Sundays ago, worship my friends can take place anytime, worship can take place anywhere, you and I can make
[time=2047] much of God, you and I can adore God, you and I can praise God, you and I can in the
[time=2053] quietness and stillness of our own heart, we can sit in a meadow, we can be in the shower,
[time=2059] we can be driving in the car and we can worship God.
[time=2063] I hope we're all clear on the fact that worship can take place 24/7.
[time=2069] Worship also takes place when we gather here in this setting right here, here is a specific
[time=2075] and very unique setting where the body of Christ is afforded the privilege of coming
[time=2081] together and worshiping God and there are times when you and I come into this place and we worship in a way that I believe sends a disturbing message, scratch disturbing.
[time=2095] I believe there are times when we come into this place and you and I can, it's within us to at times lose sight of what this is about and we can focus in a way that would be confusing for some because there are some who would look at you and die and our claims
[time=2110] to be redeemed, our claims to be saved, our claims to be enjoying the newness of life
[time=2118] and the hope that comes with it and yet we don't worship that way.
[time=2126] I believe there is a way that we can ring a really clear bell, a powerful bell through our worship that God uses to communicate the gospel, a way in which we can worship that
[time=2137] God uses to touch the hearts and souls of others who come and join us in these settings
[time=2143] or watch a broadcast.
[time=2146] 1 Corinthians 14, go there if you would.
[time=2149] This exact scenario has been laid out for us in 1 Corinthians 14, there were some questions about how it is that the body was together, how it is that they were to assemble, there
[time=2161] were some difficulties that Paul was having to address and in 1 Corinthians 14 he says in verse 23 he says, therefore if the whole church assembles which it should, that's implied,
[time=2172] the church should assemble together and if in doing that verse 23 they all speak in tongues
[time=2179] and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, people who don't know the Lord yet, people who are
[time=2186] still on the journey, people who are still asking the questions, people who are still trying to understand what it means to be fully surrendered in hard in life to Christ.
[time=2196] So they come into that setting and if everybody is speaking in tongues, different languages and different utterances, will they not say that you are what, mad, but, but if when the
[time=2211] family assembles, but if all prophesy and the word here speaks to the proclamation of that which is true, proclamation uttering that which is true, it speaks to the truth
[time=2222] of Scripture, but if all prophesy and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted
[time=2229] by all, he is called to account by all, the secrets of his heart are disclosed and so
[time=2236] he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly what among
[time=2243] you.
[time=2245] When we, when we gather to worship my friends in a spirit and atmosphere of prophecy, the
[time=2251] proclamation, the joyful proclamation of that which is true, when the modeling of truth
[time=2259] is going on in this place, when the singing of truth is going on in this place, when the teaching of truth is going on in the assembly, when people joyously gather, and I just want
[time=2274] to, I just want to encourage you again, to joyously, to joyously gather, to understand
[time=2286] what a privilege it is to know him, to understand what a privilege it is, to be able to be
[time=2293] together with the family, to understand the privilege of being able to gather in a place like this where I can see you and you can see me and I'll tell you what in seeing you,
[time=2303] you know what I think?
[time=2305] When I see you, you know what comes to mind, when I see you, what I think is praise God that you're still at it.
[time=2312] Praise God that we're still, we're still moving down this road together.
[time=2315] It may have been a good week, it may have been a tough one, but praise God that we're here together, the body joyously gathering, when the body joyously comes together in an
[time=2325] atmosphere of truth and worship, worship of our God with passion and energy and focused
[time=2332] gratitude, and hearts fully engaged, not wandering, not thinking about this afternoon, but hearts
[time=2339] and minds that are in the moment, not missing a word on the screen, singing out every note,
[time=2348] not because it's a note, but because it represents great truth and because it represents God's great love and because every song and every part of our time together is about him.
[time=2360] And when hearts are fully engaged, then look at what those still searching say when they
[time=2366] encounter our worship.
[time=2367] I thought this was so profound, especially because of the season.
[time=2372] Those who witness, those who see you and I engaged joyously in worship, they declare
[time=2379] that God is what, certainly what, Emmanuel, God is with you.
[time=2388] Here's the people, they say, who have experienced God coming near, and they act like it, and
[time=2395] they sing like it, and they relate like it.
[time=2400] I just hope you'd be really, really, really grateful in your heart for the privilege that you and I have to do this.
[time=2407] We've been saved, we've been redeemed, and we get to gather with those who have been as
[time=2413] well. I've got a friend who I sat with the other night just about a week ago, and he's
[time=2425] dying.
[time=2428] He is going to die, and it may be soon, it may be a few weeks, it could be, I don't
[time=2434] know exactly, but it looks as if he is going to die, and I'm so thankful that he's in his heart ready for that.
[time=2441] I'm so very thankful for his family, I'm so very thankful for his friends, I'm so very thankful that there's a peace in his heart about what's ahead.
[time=2450] But as I left that night, I remember thinking, boy, just, you know, I mean, bear with me here for analogy's sake, I just thought driving away, what would it be like if somehow he got word that he was saved?
[time=2462] What kind of response would we see?
[time=2467] What kind of posture would we see if somehow in God's providence that thing got reversed,
[time=2474] and he wasn't going to leave his family, and he was going to be given a few more years?
[time=2482] My friends, you and I were, we were terminal.
[time=2486] We were Ephesians 2, says we were dead in our trespasses and sin.
[time=2493] And I don't know how much time he's given you, I have no idea how much time he's given me, but we're alive, and we've been redeemed and saved, and you and I need to serve like
[time=2503] it.
[time=2504] We need to think like it, we need to relate like it, we need to gather like it, we need to worship like people who have been saved, people that are that grateful and that passionate
[time=2519] about their God.
[time=2520] Number three, Christmas bells ring when we proclaim him.
[time=2525] The Christmas bells ring when we serve him, when we worship him, when we proclaim him.
[time=2531] By proclaim, I mean explain.
[time=2534] By proclaim, I mean this opportunity that you and I get in the everyday of life, and
[time=2541] it may be for a couple of moments, it may be for a couple of hours, depending upon the circumstance our lives really can be filled with opportunities for you and I to actually
[time=2552] having served and having loved and having built relationship, we sometimes get this
[time=2558] chance to speak, to open our mouths and lovingly communicate what's true, to lovingly communicate
[time=2570] this gospel that we talked about earlier, this story of Christ, and we get to connect his
[time=2576] story, the redemptive story of the baby Jesus and the Christ that he became, and we get
[time=2583] to connect that with their story and their need and what they're facing.
[time=2589] Romans 10 talks about this, turn in your Bibles if you would to Romans 10, verse 13, Matthew
[time=2595] Mark Luke, John, Acts, Romans.
[time=2600] Romans 10, 13, Paul talks about here, he writes to the church at Rome and he speaks to this issue of how people are actually saved, and he says in verse 13 of Romans 10 and for whoever
[time=2610] will call, whoever will bow their knee, whoever will submit, whoever will lay their will and
[time=2617] their lives down and call on the name of the Lord, whoever will do this, it says will be
[time=2623] saved, how then, verse 14, how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed,
[time=2632] how will they believe in him who they have not heard, and how will they hear without a what, without a preacher?
[time=2641] Now we've looked at this passage in the past and I just, I want all of you in the room to not be wigged out by that use of the word preacher.
[time=2650] It doesn't mean that, you know, I want you to catch the picture here.
[time=2654] This is not talking about the use of the Greek word there, preacher.
[time=2657] It's not like I'm going to say, you know, you and you and you come up here and stand here and, and you know, do that, no, this is not about a pastor, a teaching elder in
[time=2669] a local church setting where the body get, no, that's not this word, this word preacher, you know what it is?
[time=2675] It's just, it's just, it is, it's not just, it's a very, it's a very important thing but it's just the one who communicates truth, preaching, it's kind of, the phrase is kind
[time=2688] of taking a bad rap over the years.
[time=2691] You know, folks can get preachy, I understand that, but we, we preach if we're going to
[time=2697] stay true to the text and that word that we communicate truth, we explain it, that's preaching.
[time=2705] And though you don't call it that and I don't call it that and we probably shouldn't, they're
[time=2711] not going to hear Paul says unless someone speaks and there are so many opportunities
[time=2720] for you and so many opportunities for me to ring bells, you know to ring bells that have
[time=2726] a really clear message that communicate the message of Christmas when you and I take the
[time=2732] time to end those settings where it's appropriate to speak and to communicate and to ask questions
[time=2739] and to, to ask some more questions and to try and figure out how to connect them in their heart and their need to the story of Christ.
[time=2746] A couple of things I want to just say to you there, when I talk about the opportunity that you have, when I talk about the opportunity that we have to communicate to people, the life-changing, eternity-altering message of Christ, I'm assuming a couple of things.
[time=2761] I'm assuming first of all that you have a relationship with somebody who you can share
[time=2767] that with.
[time=2768] Actually, you know what, I'll back up a bit.
[time=2773] Before I assume that, I'm assuming that you and I live in proximity, live, I don't mean address, I mean your life.
[time=2781] I'm assuming that you live life somehow, someway in proximity to those who desperately need
[time=2789] that message.
[time=2791] I'm assuming that you haven't structured your life to live in some cloistered, safe environment
[time=2797] far, far away from those who would have questions, those who would have need, those who would
[time=2804] be today for whatever reason, living life far from God.
[time=2810] I'm assuming that it's not like this, I'm assuming that there's proximity, that intentional
[time=2816] decisions are being made on your part and on your family's part to lovingly and with great humility, be close to those opportunities.
[time=2827] Having put yourself in proximity, I'm assuming that you're willing to give even more time and effort and intentionality to developing redemptive friendships with people for the
[time=2838] sake of loving them with no ulterior motive other than to connect and love and do whatever
[time=2846] it is God might want you to do in coming alongside and encouraging them.
[time=2850] And in that situation, oftentimes as we walk down those roads, 1 Peter 3 comes into play,
[time=2857] where they will because of their friendship with you, because of the proximity, because of you authentically and honestly and humbly living out your life and faith in their presence.
[time=2869] At some point in time, the conversations go toward what's your life all about.
[time=2875] And is it that takes place in your soul that makes you do this or think this, questions
[time=2881] get asked and you and I get the privilege of speaking.
[time=2887] We get the preach.
[time=2889] But we don't preach preach, we lovingly humbly share.
[time=2893] And I hope you understand the message that that sends, the gospel, the message of Christmas,
[time=2900] that bell rings when you and I are willing to carry ourselves in that way.
[time=2906] Now let me just say this about that.
[time=2910] I stand by all I just said and I won't let a single one of you off the hook in my encouragement
[time=2917] towards you to function and live life in that fashion.
[time=2923] While I want you to stay faithful to that, I want you to know that we find ourselves in a situation here where we get to help you, we get to incur, we get to come alongside
[time=2934] your redemptive living effort.
[time=2938] And what I mean by that is this, I mean some people would say that this isn't as possible anymore in today's culture, I completely disagree.
[time=2947] And what I'm referring to is the power of the invitation.
[time=2951] And I believe with all of my heart that when you live in proximity, when in the everyday
[time=2957] of your life, you've postured yourself humbly and lovingly with people far from God.
[time=2962] When you're willing to, without any ulterior motive other than just to be loving and kind, when you build relationships with them, when conversations get started, when there's dialogue,
[time=2973] when there's some life spent together, and you in that context having built that kind of trust say, "Hey, why don't you come with me this weekend?" The church where I gather, we're doing a weekend of Christmas celebrations, I'd love you to come with me.
[time=2989] They'll say, "Yeah, I'd love to." 90% of the time, when you say to them, "Hey, how about if you, you know, having established
[time=3000] all of that?" And you say, "Hey, why don't you come with me to my small group?" "Well, I'd love to have you come with me, meet some of my friends.
[time=3006] We're on the same journey, we're studying God's Word." Most of the time they'll say, "Yes." When you say, "Come with me on a Sunday," from that context, proximity and relationship, and the questions are being asked, they'll come, and we'll have the opportunity to support
[time=3024] you in that redemptive effort, your effort to proclaim in a number of different ways.
[time=3032] The Christmas bell rings, my friend, when we serve him, when we worship him, when we proclaim him, and when we give.
[time=3040] When we give, it was just a couple of weeks ago that we had such a sweet time together talking about and studying what it says there in Matthew 6 about laying up with our finances,
[time=3051] with our time and our talent and our treasure.
[time=3054] We talked about laying up, specifically financially, treasures in heaven, trying to be a people
[time=3062] that would move away from this absolute obsession with treasures on earth, letting go of that
[time=3068] stuff and realizing how when we give that appropriately to the kingdom, we lay up, he
[time=3075] helps us lay up for ourselves, people in heaven, treasures in heaven.
[time=3082] And I am so very thankful.
[time=3084] I know many of you are too.
[time=3085] I've heard from many of you in the last few weeks, and I know that along with myself and our leadership team, many of you are grateful for our effort this Christmas to give financially
[time=3096] and physically to those in need.
[time=3099] I think specifically of our end-of-the-year-giving opportunity, those cards that are there in the Pew Rack, the end-of-the-year offering cards, they say on them outside, inside.
[time=3112] And I am so grateful that as a leadership, we've decided this year to encourage each
[time=3118] and every one of you.
[time=3119] We're encouraging kids, we're encouraging children's classes, we're encouraging students, we're encouraging parents, families, we're encouraging everybody to give thought to what
[time=3130] you might, at a sacrificial level, what you might bring at the end of this year for the outside, inside giving opportunity.
[time=3139] The first, I'm so thankful, the first $30,000 of that effort is going toward the Mission
[time=3145] Church.
[time=3146] Our good friends Tim and Karen Stauffer, downtown at the Rescue Mission, the church is housed in the Rescue Mission.
[time=3152] The mission statement there is they're trying with God's help to break cycles of poverty and addiction.
[time=3157] They deal with a demographic of folks, dear, dear people that's different than the demographic
[time=3164] we deal with here.
[time=3166] And yet we have this partnership with them and we have this commitment to do all that we can, not even just financially.
[time=3172] I told you about coats and hats and many of you responded, there's still a need.
[time=3177] You can bring by winter coats or hats so many of the people that the Mission Church reaches
[time=3183] out to don't have coats.
[time=3186] Right now they face the weather today without coats and it's such a great tool, it's a great
[time=3193] opportunity for the folks in that church to be able to provide that kind of thing.
[time=3198] And so as you continue every one of you, as you keep thinking about your year-end outside inside gift, I just want to tell you how thankful I am for your willingness to give.
[time=3209] When you give, and I know it's a private thing, you know, but when we give the effects of
[time=3216] that giving, it rings a really clear message of the gospel to those that receive it, to
[time=3224] those that hear it, to those that watch.
[time=3226] You ring Christmas bells when you take a card off the vine out in the foyer or the tender
[time=3233] hearts tree, those opportunities representing real people right here inside these four walls
[time=3239] who have real physical needs at Christmas.
[time=3243] You ring the Christmas bell when you respond in that way.
[time=3248] When you give, when you give financially, now when you think about giving financially, don't just think about the offering check, don't think about just the money you put in
[time=3258] the plate as important as that is and as much as God uses that.
[time=3262] Don't forget that you give when you buy a card for somebody.
[time=3267] When you buy a card for a friend in need and you write a note of truth and encouragement,
[time=3273] when you take a friend to lunch and pay for it.
[time=3278] And that might even be Wendy's and that sweet little 99 cent menu, gosh, I love that menu.
[time=3285] I love that menu, thank you.
[time=3288] Throw a tomato on that crispy chicken sometime, it's awesome.
[time=3293] We could be talking three or four bucks.
[time=3296] It's a gift you give, I mean it might be you helping pay a bill.
[time=3304] It might mean you providing a meal.
[time=3307] It's not just a check, it's not just about the cash, it's about you and I ringing a really
[time=3313] clear reverberating message of giving and I hope you'll give some thought to these.
[time=3321] I hope today as you leave this place, here you go, I hope you'll pick one.
[time=3327] I don't want you to figure the whole thing out this week, too many points.
[time=3330] I hope you'll pick one, look at the screen, I hope this week you would have just enough integrity in your heart and a desire in your soul to take one of those serving or the way
[time=3341] that you come to worship, the way in which you might be willing to articulate, actually speak the truth into somebody's heart and life.
[time=3350] Maybe it's the giving that you're still considering as you think about you're in, but I would invite you to pick one, would you just pick one this week?
[time=3358] And you individually and with your friends or with your kids start to figure out ways that this week you could ring that one bell loud and clear.
[time=3370] Maybe if you could just walk away this morning with that one, just pick one right now, just write it down, just store it in your mind one way of the four, pick one.
[time=3380] That this week you would be willing to ask God for help in ringing that bell.
[time=3386] I hope you'll take that with you this morning.
[time=3389] If you come to an intersection and there's a motorcycle, just go, don't forget that one.
[time=3397] And with that I hope you'll take one of these four truths and ask God, beg God, to help you apply it in your life.
[time=3405] Ring your bells, my friends, at Christmas.
[time=3409] Inside these four walls, outside these four walls.
[time=3413] And thank God.
[time=3415] Thank God that we have something like this, the birth of his son and the great message of the gospel to celebrate together.
[time=3424] [AMEN] If you want to stand and let me pray for us as we go, Father God, we do thank you.
[time=3430] I'm so grateful for each and every person in this room this morning and we are so thankful for the season that is upon us.
[time=3438] God as we think about the noise that we make, we'd want it to be sweet.
[time=3444] We would want it to be an aroma to you.
[time=3447] We would want to be bells, as it were, that reverberate messages of hope and love and
[time=3455] peace and service and worship and giving.
[time=3461] God that we could be a people that would proclaim with great sensitivity and love this life-changing message of Christmas.
[time=3469] Thank you for the time that you gave us here together this morning and as we leave I pray God that in a very real way many, many people in this room today would leave having made
[time=3479] a commitment to take one of these points this morning and to ring that bell as often
[time=3487] and as faithfully as they can in the days to come.
[time=3491] Thank you so very much for the family, God that you're growing here.
[time=3495] And as we gather together this weekend, God I pray that we would gather as the redeemed.
[time=3500] I pray we would gather with great spirit and with great energy.
[time=3504] I pray, God, that we would extend invitations.
[time=3506] Still, this week, I pray that we would get extra tickets.
[time=3509] I pray that we would do whatever necessary to invite those that need to hear the life-saving
[time=3516] message of Christmas to come and to join us in this greatest of all endeavors.
[time=3521] Thank you for those who are here.
[time=3524] Thank you for the opportunities we'll have this coming weekend.
[time=3527] We pray for Corbin and Beth and Lauren and Ed and the team.
[time=3532] We pray, God, that you would give those who work with them great stability and great energy and a great spirit as they serve in such a special and unique way.
