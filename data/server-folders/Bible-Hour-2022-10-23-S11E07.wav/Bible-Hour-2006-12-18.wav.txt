[time=305] I appreciate it.
[time=306] I'm not sure.
[time=307] I can remember the last time someone called me brilliant.
[time=308] So thank you very much.
[time=309] [TAKE VO] [TAKE VO] Well, Kelly asked me if I would be willing to preach something from the Psalms in this summer series called "Summer in the Psalms."
[time=318] And immediately I said yes.
[time=320] I want to do that.
[time=321] And almost as quickly, Psalm 51 came to my mind.
[time=326] The confession of David after his sin of adultery with Bathsheba and the sin of murder killing having Bathsheba's husband killed in battle.
[time=339] Immediately that came to my mind.
[time=341] And then, and I don't know if this was a spirit prompting or just something in me, but immediately the words came to my mind.
[time=348] The power of confession.
[time=350] David got on his face before God and confessed some of the most heinous sins we can imagine.
[time=359] And it unleashed God's incredible grace in his life.
[time=365] The power of confession.
[time=369] And so I have been meditating on and reading Psalm 51 and studying it and looking at the context of Psalm 51.
[time=377] That's 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel 11 and 12, the story of David and Bathsheba and then of Nathan the prophet confronting David in his sin.
[time=387] And I've been just meditating on this and it's been rich and deep.
[time=392] And my prayer is that as we spend time thinking about this and considering God's word for us today,
[time=399] that would touch our hearts, touch our minds in a way that God hasn't done that in a while.
[time=406] He's done that in me in the last few weeks.
[time=409] And I pray that the same thing would be true of you that God's spirit would just do incredible work today
[time=415] as we consider the power of confession.
[time=419] Last week, Josh Grayne, one of our new pastors who's back to the fort, as he says, spoke on Psalm 32.
[time=428] And Psalm 32 is an outworking of Psalm 51.
[time=431] Psalm 32 is written by David after he wrote Psalm 51, his confession in Psalm 51.
[time=437] In Psalm 51, late in the chapter, David said, "Then I will teach transgressors your ways."
[time=445] Then is after the forgiveness and the confession.
[time=450] Then I will teach transgressors your way.
[time=452] And so that's what David did in Psalm 32.
[time=455] He was attempting to teach transgressors God's way in Psalm 32.
[time=461] And so Josh outlined Psalm 32 for us and he talked about the circle of safety.
[time=468] Do you remember the little diagram he created?
[time=470] There it is. Inside that circle of safety, the circle of faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to God in His Word.
[time=478] Inside that circle of safety is mercy, life, and blessing.
[time=485] Outside of that circle of safety is sorrow and brokenness and heartache.
[time=492] And as believers, we can be in the circle of safety and enjoy God's mercy and His grace, His life and His blessing.
[time=501] But when we step outside of obedience, that circle of safety, then it's sorrow and brokenness.
[time=507] Do you remember last week also, he used the analogy of the hamster in the little acrylic ball.
[time=513] The hamster gets in there and he just kind of runs in that circle and inside that acrylic ball, that hamster's life is just, it's gravy.
[time=523] It's all good. Outside of that circle, outside of that sphere, there's some hazards out there for the hamster, as Josh explained to us.
[time=532] You also remember last week, somehow Pastor Kelly's face flashed in there.
[time=536] Do you remember that? It was just real quick.
[time=538] Well, I thought in the spirit of Christian love and revenge, we ought to flash somebody else's face in there.
[time=544] And so I ask if we could get Josh's face in there just to give him back a little bit.
[time=548] And there it is. There's our buddy, Josh.
[time=551] Well, that was last week, the circle of safety.
[time=555] You know, I've been a believer since 19, wait till you hear this year, 68.
[time=560] I'm 46 years old. I was eight years old when I remember sitting in the front row of my church in Elkhart, Indiana, and knowing that if I died that night as an eight year old boy, I was going to go to hell unless I placed my faith in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=576] And that's a long time ago.
[time=578] But through those years of being a believer and observing and learning my own sin nature,
[time=588] there are times when it is so easy to step outside of that circle of safety and get to a place that you never imagined you could be.
[time=598] I've observed people in my church and in the Christian community over the years, many years of being a believer who I know they have a walk with God in the genuine faith.
[time=607] And they were in that circle of safety of God's life and his blessing and his mercy and his grace.
[time=613] But today, they're outside that circle of safety so far away, it just grieves my heart.
[time=622] You know, I think about Christian men in business who take the name of Christ and don't practice integrity in their business.
[time=632] How does a person who knows Christ and can experience life in that circle of safety get out somewhere where they're embezzling money or crashing a business
[time=642] or doing something that is so contrary to what God would want?
[time=647] Or I've observed spouses, a husband or a wife who gets to the point where they've chosen to leave the family that God's given them, to leave the spouse, to leave the children and walk away.
[time=661] And somehow they've gotten outside of that circle of safety and got way over here outside of God's plan for their life.
[time=667] How did that happen? Do those people, do we, when we get outside of the circle of safety, do we wake up one morning and say, you know what I'm going to do?
[time=677] I'm going to jump outside God's will for my life and just go get totally immersed in the way of the world and just ruin my life with sin.
[time=686] No, it doesn't happen like that, does it? It doesn't happen like that.
[time=691] And I think when we look at Psalm 51 and the context of David and his life, we will see some insight today in how a person like David, who was described by God himself as a man after his own heart, a man after God's own heart, that's how God described David.
[time=709] How could David, a man like that, get way over here in adultery and deception, conspiracy and murder.
[time=721] How does that happen? How does he get there? He didn't wake up one morning and say, I think I'm going to kill somebody.
[time=729] No, it doesn't happen like that. Getting outside the circle of safety takes a little time and it's because of the work of the enemy.
[time=739] You know, we have to reckon with that, my friends. We have to reckon with the fact that there's spiritual warfare going on.
[time=746] And we have the privilege and the honor to choose life and obedience in Jesus Christ, or we can succumb to the temptation of our flesh and walk outside that circle of safety.
[time=757] And I can tell you, every time we take a step outside that circle of safety a little bit further away, we all have the same capacity that David has, that sin nature get way over here and do the most heinous things that you can't even imagine.
[time=772] I have that capacity, you have that capacity.
[time=776] And I hope that as we look at this psalm today and the context of this psalm in 2 Samuel 11 and 12, that we'll just get a little bit of a glimpse of how that can happen.
[time=787] But more importantly, I hope we get a glimpse today of God's incredible grace and how simple confession and repentance unleashes God's grace in our life.
[time=798] God is the God of restoration, God is the God of forgiveness, God is the God of healing.
[time=803] And no matter where you're at today and no matter where I'm at today, God's grace can cover all of that and all he asks is that we confess, is that we repent.
[time=813] And before we go any further, we need to nail down the definition of those two words.
[time=818] Confession is an important biblical concept and in the New Testament, the Greek word is homo legato.
[time=826] And after the first hour, someone, a Greek scholar came and helped me out with the pronunciation of that word.
[time=832] Homo legato, two words there, homo meaning the same, logo meaning word, the same word, or confession literally means to agree with God.
[time=843] Whatever God says, I agree with it.
[time=846] If God says it's sin, I say it's sin. If God says this is righteousness, I say this is righteousness.
[time=852] No matter what God says, if God says this is my son, Jesus Christ, it's the only way to heaven, it's the only way to relationship with me.
[time=861] I confess that I agree with God, I say the same words, that's confession.
[time=865] I have to tell you a story real quick.
[time=868] Several years ago when my kids were in junior high school and they were playing basketball and volleyball and on the school team, one Saturday morning our junior high
[time=875] basketball team was participating in a basketball tournament, a little Catholic school in Muncie, Indiana.
[time=882] And it's nine o'clock on a Saturday morning, you're sitting in the gym with all the parents, the kids are getting ready to play.
[time=887] And on a blustery January morning at nine o'clock in the gym, don't you just have to have a cup of coffee?
[time=892] I hadn't had mine yet and I was just longing for a cup of coffee and maybe a donut.
[time=897] And pretty soon I see people with cups of coffee and I'm like, they must have concessions somewhere.
[time=901] Where do I go get that coffee?
[time=903] And then someone walks in with a big old muffin, one of those homemade muffins that's about the size of your head.
[time=907] And I had to have one of those things.
[time=909] And so I looked around, I didn't know where they sold the concessions.
[time=912] So I walked back out of the gym, went to the table where I'd bought my ticket and there the principal of this little Catholic school was sitting there.
[time=918] And she was a nun and her, I think it was a teacher was next to her and they were collecting the money from the tickets.
[time=923] And so I just simply ask, hey, where are the concessions?
[time=926] And the principal of the school, this nun said to me, well, if you go out this door here and then out the sidewalk outside
[time=932] and then down this little path, there'll be the chapel over there.
[time=935] And as a school administrator, I'm thinking, boy, that is a silly place to have concession.
[time=939] Who wants to walk outside on a January morning to go get a cup of coffee?
[time=942] About that time, her friend Nudge Dern said, he said, concessions, not confessions.
[time=947] (Laughter) So this morning, we're not talking about concessions, we're talking about confession.
[time=953] That is agreeing with God, saying the same words that God says.
[time=958] The second definition we have to nail down is repentance.
[time=961] Repentance, it simply means to change direction.
[time=965] Confession is I'm agreeing with God.
[time=967] I say the same thing about my life that God says.
[time=971] I agree with God.
[time=973] Repentance is a little bit different.
[time=975] Repentance, here's the picture.
[time=976] I'm going this way and I have a change of mind and a change of heart and I stop and I go the opposite direction.
[time=985] That's repentance.
[time=987] Confession is agreeing with God, repentance is changing my mind and then ultimately changing my direction, changing my behavior.
[time=996] In 1 John 1, 9, you know this verse.
[time=999] It says, if we confess, that's homo legato, if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin.
[time=1007] And then the word repentance, Jesus used many times recorded in the Gospel.
[time=1010] Matthew 4 17 says, from that time on Jesus began to preach, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[time=1017] That means stop, turn the other direction, change your heart, change your mind.
[time=1022] And those are the definitions of the words that we need to understand today as we study Psalm 51.
[time=1027] And then there are basically three ideas that I want you to consider today as we look at Psalm 51 and the context of this passage.
[time=1035] The first one is the confusion from sin and there we're going to look at 2 Samuel, chapter 11.
[time=1042] And then we're going to look at the next chapter which is Nathan's confrontation, the confrontation from God's man.
[time=1048] Because it's the confrontation that bridged David's confused sinful state to his confession.
[time=1054] And then we'll finally get to Psalm 51 and look at the confession from the heart, from David's heart.
[time=1062] And so let's dig into it, okay?
[time=1069] If you're in 2 Samuel, go there to 2 Samuel, chapter 11.
[time=1075] And let's look at again a little bit deeper of the context of what was happening here that caused David to write Psalm 51.
[time=1088] Before we do that, can I ask you this question?
[time=1091] Can you think of someone in your life that you know of that is close to you that's outside of that circle of safety?
[time=1100] Somehow they've got outside of that circle and maybe they're out just a little ways, maybe they're long, long ways outside of that circle away from God's plan and his will.
[time=1111] Can you think of someone?
[time=1113] I can, I've mentioned some of the people that I've grown up with, I remember close personal friends who went to Bible college with training for ministry who today are far, far outside that circle of safety.
[time=1127] Can you think of someone?
[time=1129] Here's another question for you.
[time=1131] When you think of yourself, can you remember a time when you were outside that circle of safety?
[time=1138] Maybe today is that time when you're outside God's circle of safety and outside of his will and his life and his mercy and his blessing and his grace.
[time=1148] Well, I want to look at this passage and try to gain some insight in how that can happen.
[time=1155] How a person who loves the Lord Jesus Christ can get so far outside the circle of safety.
[time=1161] You know, and thinking about this, I thought of a couple other passages in Scripture that probably are a little bit far away from Psalm 51, but I think illustrate the point of how someone can get there.
[time=1171] You know, the prodigal son, Luke 15, Jesus told the parable about this young man who grew up in a family who had everything he needed, had a great family, they had wealth, they had everything they needed.
[time=1183] But this young man decided, I'm going to take my inheritance early, I'm going to leave my father and my home, I'm going to go to a land and I'm going to squander it all and experience all the world has to offer.
[time=1194] And he did just that, and where did he land?
[time=1197] The famine came, he blew all of his money, and the prodigal son, as Jesus tells this parable story, ends up in the pig pen.
[time=1206] He had no work, he had no food, so he went to a pig farm and shoveled pig slop.
[time=1214] Matter of fact, Scripture says that's where he lived, he didn't even have a roof over his head, he slept in the pig pen.
[time=1220] How does a guy like that, how does the prodigal son get outside of the circle of safety of his father's world and his blessing and his mercy and his grace and get in a pig pen?
[time=1231] Well you know what, Luke 15, as Jesus tells the story, he said the prodigal son was laying there in the pig pen and then came to his senses.
[time=1244] And I think those are spiritual senses, somehow a prodigal son took so many steps away from the circle of safety that he was out of his spiritual senses.
[time=1256] And that's when he said, "I'm going to go back home, I'll go back to my dad and say I'm sorry father, and I know I can't even be your son anymore, but I'll just be a hired hand."
[time=1267] And you know the story, he went home and his dad saw him and welcomed him back with open arms.
[time=1273] What a beautiful picture of what we're talking about today, both of how someone can get outside of the circle of safety and how God the Father welcomes us back at any time with wide open arms,
[time=1285] with simple confession.
[time=1287] Well, let's look at David now.
[time=1290] David in chapter 11 is the story of his adultery with Bathsheba.
[time=1298] But before we start in chapter 11, keep your finger there and just jump back a few chapters to chapter 5.
[time=1306] Chapter 5 of 2 Samuel, and we'll see something that just a sentence tucked away in this historical chronicle says this in 2 Samuel 5 verse 13.
[time=1320] After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.
[time=1328] And in that culture, polygamy was certainly acceptable and practiced by the other kings, although not God's standard.
[time=1338] Let's go back a little bit further, keep your hand in 2 Samuel 11, and go back a little bit further to Deuteronomy chapter 17 verses 14 through 17.
[time=1348] Here's God's standard on this issue, very specifically directed to the kings of Israel.
[time=1353] When you enter the land, the Lord your God has given you and have taken possession of it and settle in it, and you say, let us set a king over us like all the nations around us.
[time=1362] Be sure to appoint over you the king the Lord your God chooses.
[time=1366] He must be from among your own brothers. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not a brother or an Israelite.
[time=1371] The king, moreover, and here's the specific command God gives, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself
[time=1378] or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them.
[time=1382] For the Lord has told you you are not to go back that way again.
[time=1385] That's the first thing, don't collect horses.
[time=1388] Number two, he must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray.
[time=1393] He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.
[time=1397] God said to the kings of Israel, don't collect horses, which was a symbol of wealth.
[time=1402] Don't take many wives and don't accumulate great wealth.
[time=1406] David did pretty good on two of the three, but we find here David took more wives into his harem.
[time=1416] That was a violation of God's standard.
[time=1418] And here's the first thing, the first indicator, maybe the first insight on how a David, a man after God's own heart, can get outside the circle of safety.
[time=1426] It's just the small decisions.
[time=1428] It's the seemingly insignificant decisions.
[time=1432] This little truth just packed away in chapter five here said he took more wives.
[time=1437] And David made a little decision, a small decision, that had seemingly small consequences.
[time=1444] You know what, here's what that looks like for us today when we take that first step outside the circle of safety.
[time=1451] It looks something like this.
[time=1453] I'm just going to go to that party, but I won't participate.
[time=1457] I'm just going to go there and be there.
[time=1459] I'm going to hang out with these people, even though I know their walk isn't good for me.
[time=1464] But I'll go be with them. I'll hang out there.
[time=1467] Or I'll visit that website.
[time=1469] I won't linger. I'll just take a peek.
[time=1472] It's the first step.
[time=1474] Or maybe I'll just go to this place.
[time=1477] Or I have this relationship, but I won't let the relationship get out of hand.
[time=1482] That's what that first step, that small decision with small inconsequences looks like.
[time=1487] Our responsibility is not to dabble or indulge in the appetites of the flesh.
[time=1493] Even the little ones.
[time=1496] God's standard is clear for us and it's in his word.
[time=1499] And we start outside the circle of safety by making those small decisions that have seemingly small consequences.
[time=1506] Here's another thing is we look at the context of David's life and how he got there, where he committed adultery and murder.
[time=1513] Because from chapter 5 to chapter 11, it's literally a chronicle of the successes of the Israelite nation and specifically David's successes.
[time=1522] Here's what we saw in chapters 5 through 11.
[time=1528] David's victories in battle are outlined.
[time=1530] The fact that the nation admired their king and they loved him.
[time=1534] He had public admiration. He had ample money.
[time=1537] He had power. No one questioned David's authority or his power within the kingdom or outside of the kingdom.
[time=1544] He had the authority, he even had fame.
[time=1547] Again, both inside the kingdom and outside the kingdom.
[time=1549] In chapters 5 through 11, chronicle these successes in David's life.
[time=1553] And maybe that's another indicator of how David could get there because sometimes great successes brings vulnerability.
[time=1564] David was at the top of his game. He was the one in charge.
[time=1569] And for you and I, maybe it looks like this.
[time=1571] Maybe it's that promotion at work and things are going great at work.
[time=1575] Man, I'm on top of my game at work. I got this promotion I didn't expect it, but they brought me up and wow.
[time=1583] Or maybe things are really great in the marriage.
[time=1586] Things are going great. We haven't loved each other like this forever.
[time=1590] And this is good. Things are going good with the kids maybe.
[time=1593] They're all walking with the Lord and everything's in order.
[time=1596] Matter of fact, I'm serving in the church. I've got my priorities all in order.
[time=1600] I'm on top of my spiritual game.
[time=1603] Well, if that's you or if that's me, here's the admonition from Scripture.
[time=1609] Look at 1 Corinthians 10-12 because sometimes great success brings vulnerability.
[time=1616] Here's what it says, so if you think you're standing firm, you be careful that you don't fall.
[time=1622] Listen, it's in the times of success and prosperity and wealth and things going great that we find ourselves most vulnerable. And this was true of David.
[time=1631] He was at the top, the pinnacle of what could possibly be as king of Israel.
[time=1637] And that's where he was vulnerable.
[time=1640] And then with that great success and that vulnerability, here's what else happened.
[time=1649] He was unaccountable to anyone. And I've noticed this.
[time=1653] Anytime we become unaccountable to others, it's not long before we become unaccountable to God.
[time=1660] So unaccountability to others led to his unaccountability to God.
[time=1666] David was king. No one was going to question him. He didn't have a small group that he met with every Tuesday morning for breakfast.
[time=1674] That wasn't David's practice. He was king.
[time=1678] And as king and with that success came vulnerability and unaccountability and ultimately unaccountability to God.
[time=1686] You know what? Life in the body of Christ is different than that.
[time=1691] In the body of Christ, God has called us to be accountable to one another.
[time=1694] Matter of fact, I went this past week and looked up all the one another passages in the New Testament.
[time=1699] You're familiar with those, right? Love one another.
[time=1702] Matter of fact, the love one another is in the New Testament 12 to 15 times, maybe more.
[time=1707] But here are the other ones. Honor one another. Be devoted to one another.
[time=1711] Live in harmony with one another, accept one another, instruct one another.
[time=1714] Agree with one another, serve one another. Bear with one another's burdens.
[time=1719] Be kind and compassionate to one another. Speak in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to one another.
[time=1725] Submit to one another. Forgive one another. Encourage one another.
[time=1729] Listen to this. Spur one another onto good works.
[time=1733] And this one admonish one another.
[time=1737] That's a picture of the body of Christ. When we as believers support one another, hold each other accountable. Here's my question to you today.
[time=1744] Do you have someone you're accountable to so that you're not taking steps, little steps outside the circle of safety,
[time=1751] that someone can come alongside you and hold you accountable to your walk?
[time=1756] I challenge you today if you don't have someone you're accountable to make yourself accountable to someone,
[time=1762] because unaccountability to others leads to unaccountability to God.
[time=1768] And then finally, we get to this point. In verse 1 of chapter 11, it says this.
[time=1774] In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king's men and the whole Israelite army.
[time=1780] They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabah, but David remained in Jerusalem.
[time=1787] The very next verse says, "One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace."
[time=1795] And here's the point, David was in bed, not in battle where he belonged.
[time=1800] In the spring in that culture, that's when the armies got together and went out and did their military warfare.
[time=1805] And the kings led their armies militarily, and David decided this spring to stay home.
[time=1814] And that brings us to the temptation.
[time=1818] It was at that time when David was in bed and not in battle. He was in a place where he didn't belong.
[time=1825] It was a time of leisure and rest. That's when the temptation hit him and he yielded to that temptation.
[time=1833] You know, I have found that my greatest times of temptation come in times of leisure.
[time=1839] Maybe I am doing what God has called me to do, but it's when there's huge periods of time.
[time=1845] I find my flesh is aroused and I'm tempted in those times of leisure.
[time=1852] Maybe it's if you travel as a businessman or woman and you're alone in a hotel at night,
[time=1858] it's those lonely hours of leisure with huge blocks of time that's when temptation comes the strongest.
[time=1868] And that's what happened here with David.
[time=1871] He was in bed, not in battle. It was his time of leisure where he faced his greatest temptation.
[time=1878] And then, verse 3, "And David sent someone to find out about her." He saw from his roof this beautiful woman, "And David sent someone to find out about her." And the man said, "Isn't this Bathsheba the daughter of Elium?" And David sent a messenger to her and had Bathsheba brought to him, and there they committed adultery.
[time=1897] And there she conceived and became pregnant.
[time=1901] Listen, it was at that moment of temptation that David didn't reject God, he forgot God.
[time=1909] In the past month or so, I came across some work from Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
[time=1915] Dietrich Bonhoeffer is, I think, fast becoming as credible as C.S. Lewis as a Christian writer.
[time=1920] He was executed by the Nazi German regime during World War II because of his resistance to Hitler.
[time=1926] And just now, his writings are becoming so prevalent and so well known.
[time=1931] And here's a quote that Dietrich Bonhoeffer said about this very issue of forgetting God.
[time=1935] It's lengthy, but hang on with me, would you follow along?
[time=1938] In our members, there is a slumbering inclination toward desire, which is both sudden and fierce.
[time=1943] With irresistible power, desire seizes mastery of the flesh.
[time=1948] And all it wants, a secret smoldering fire, is kindled.
[time=1951] The flesh burns and is in flames. It makes no difference whether it's sexual desire, or ambition, or vanity, or desire for revenge, or love, of fame, of power, or greed for money.
[time=1962] At this moment, God becomes quite unreal to us.
[time=1968] We forget God.
[time=1970] He loses all reality and only desire for the creature or the object is real then.
[time=1976] The only reality is the devil. Satan does not here fill us with hatred of God, but he fills us with forgetfulness of God.
[time=1985] The lust, thus arouse, envelopes the mind and will of the man in deepest darkness.
[time=1989] The power of clear discrimination and of decision are taken from us.
[time=1994] The questions now present themselves as, is what the flesh desires really sin in this case?
[time=2000] And is it really not permitted to me?
[time=2003] Yes, even expected of me now here in my particular situation to appease this desire.
[time=2008] It is here that everything within me rises up against the Word of God, therefore the Bible teaches us in these times of temptation in the flesh.
[time=2016] There is one command, and it is flee.
[time=2020] Flee fornication, flee idolatry, flee youthful lusts, flee the lusts of the world.
[time=2027] There is no resistance to Satan in lust other than flight.
[time=2032] Every struggle against lust in one's own strength is doomed to failure.
[time=2037] And that's where we find David.
[time=2039] God became unreal to him. He didn't despise God, he only forgot God,
[time=2045] and he took that step outside the circle of safety and committed adultery.
[time=2051] Well, David was in bed, not in battle, and he forgot God and yielded to the temptation.
[time=2058] And then the cover-up led to further sin.
[time=2062] Because when he got word that Bathsheba was indeed pregnant, he had a choice right there.
[time=2067] He could choose to confess that to God, confess that to his counselors, confess it to the nations,
[time=2074] confess it to Bathsheba's husband, and make it right.
[time=2078] Or he could cover it up and he chose the latter.
[time=2083] He came up with a diabolical plan, literally a diabolical plan to cover this thing up.
[time=2088] He brought the husband back and tried to have the husband get with Bathsheba,
[time=2096] and that didn't work, so he sent the husband back into the battle lines, bearing the letter that had his own execution warrant in it, gave it to the commander, which the letter said, "Put him up at the front of the lines when the battle is fierce, his drawback, and indeed that happened, and Uriah the husband was killed."
[time=2114] And that was the cover-up.
[time=2116] First it was one small step, then it was success and vulnerability.
[time=2123] And then it was forgetting God, and then the cover-up.
[time=2127] And pretty soon David finds himself so far away from God's will and plan a purpose for his life that it's hard to even imagine.
[time=2135] It's recorded here honestly for us in chapter 11.
[time=2139] I want you to go to the very last verse of chapter 11.
[time=2142] Here's what it says, verse 27, "After the time of mourning was over, Uriah's wife Bathsheba was mourning the death of her husband.
[time=2150] After this time of mourning was over, David had her, Bathsheba brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son." Now listen to this, here's the final sentence of chapter 11, "But the thing David had done displeased the Lord."
[time=2164] Sin is sin, and it always displeases the Lord.
[time=2167] It displeases the Lord, then it displeases the Lord today.
[time=2170] This thing that David had done displeased the Lord.
[time=2174] David then was caught in this trap of sleeplessness, illness, fever,
[time=2180] the memories of what he had done.
[time=2182] And chapter 32 of Psalm talks about all of that, and that's where David was.
[time=2188] Well, here's the great thing about this story.
[time=2193] The great thing is that there's a bridge from this confused state of sin to the confession, and it's the confrontation from God's man.
[time=2201] It's the very next chapter.
[time=2203] It's chapter 12, "Enter a guy named Nathan, the prophet of God,
[time=2209] the guy who was designed by God to be his mouthpiece during this time of Israel's history."
[time=2215] And Nathan knew David well as the king, and David knew and respected Nathan the prophet
[time=2222] very well as well.
[time=2224] But here in chapter 12, we find a beautiful model of loving confrontation.
[time=2231] And here are four things, just real quick, and we're going to move through them quickly.
[time=2234] First of all, Nathan had a right relationship.
[time=2237] He had the right information when he went to David.
[time=2240] He went with the right timing.
[time=2242] He went at the right time, and lastly, he used the right words.
[time=2246] Now, I just want to take another moment and look at this model of confrontation.
[time=2251] Would you look in chapter 12 with me in the first few verses, because I want you to hear how Nathan came to David the king.
[time=2258] He had to be just a little intimidated to go.
[time=2260] This was the king.
[time=2262] But he went out of obedience.
[time=2264] He went because he had the right relationship with David.
[time=2267] He went because he had the right information.
[time=2269] He knew about this sin.
[time=2271] He went at the right time, at God's appointed time, and he used the right words.
[time=2275] And here's what he said, "The Lord sent Nathan to David." When he came to him, he said, "There were two men in a certain town, one rich in the other poor.
[time=2282] The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one little u-lam that he had bought.
[time=2290] He raised it and grew it up with him and his children.
[time=2293] It shared his food, drank from his cup, and even slept in his arms.
[time=2298] This little lamb was like a daughter to him." Now, a traveler, verse 4, "Came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him.
[time=2309] Instead, he took the u-lam that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him."
[time=2316] Now, here's David's response when he hears this story from Nathan.
[time=2319] "David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan.
[time=2323] As surely as the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die.
[time=2327] He must pay for that lamb four times over because he did such a thing and he had no pity."
[time=2333] Listen to what Nathan said next.
[time=2335] The next four words are so powerful because David's own words indicted him.
[time=2340] And Nathan said to him, "You are the man." And that brought it all crashing down.
[time=2348] This beautiful model of confrontation, the right relationship, the right information, the right timing, the right words.
[time=2355] Nathan lovingly confronted David and David said, "Surely I have sinned against the Lord."
[time=2363] Well, David was broken at this point and there had to be some sense of relief that somebody knew all of this
[time=2371] and that there is now some end to this sleeplessness and the illness and the groaning that was going on inside of him because of his sin.
[time=2379] But yet there were huge consequences to his sin and before we get to Psalm 51 and see the beautiful, beautiful outpouring that comes from confession,
[time=2389] I want you to know that there were huge consequences for David's sin.
[time=2393] Even though God poured his grace out in David's life, he were the consequences.
[time=2397] The first thing that the Bible says is that the sword would never leave his family.
[time=2402] Another consequence is that the baby that was born between David and Bathsheba died.
[time=2407] And then in David's own family, a step son raped a step daughter.
[time=2413] There was murder in his family.
[time=2415] There was betrayal.
[time=2416] There was revenge.
[time=2417] There was conspiracy.
[time=2418] Even one of his sons tried to overthrow his dad as king of Israel.
[time=2423] It was a horrible period of time in the history of Israel and those consequences came as a result of David's sin.
[time=2432] You know what? Here's the question I want to ask you today concerning Nathan and this beautiful picture, this beautiful model of confrontation.
[time=2441] Would you be willing to be a Nathan to somebody?
[time=2446] Would you be willing in the context of a right relationship and having the right information and the right timing and the right words?
[time=2454] Go to somebody who you know and love who stepped outside of that circle of safety and their life is not a life of faith and obedience.
[time=2463] Would you be willing to be that Nathan?
[time=2465] Listen, God tells us that's what we're to do.
[time=2468] Galatians 6-1 says this, "Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently, but you watch yourself that you also may be tempted."
[time=2479] That is our responsibility to the people that we know and love in the body of Christ is to be a Nathan.
[time=2485] And here's the next question I have to ask you and maybe this is even more important.
[time=2489] Do you have a Nathan in your life?
[time=2493] Is there somebody that you could say, "You are my Nathan." Matter of fact, if you have your pen in your hand and you have notes, write down the name of somebody right now who you know, love and respect that you would be willing to go to and say, "Would you be my Nathan?"
[time=2508] That when I step outside of obedience and outside the circle of safety, would you please come to me and lovingly confront me just like Nathan did David?
[time=2519] Would you be willing to be a Nathan and do you have a Nathan in your life?
[time=2523] Well, finally, we get to Psalm 51.
[time=2527] Would you go there?
[time=2528] I want to share just four quick things from the confession from David's heart in Psalm 51.
[time=2535] And the first thing is in verse 10.
[time=2539] Verse 10 says, "Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me."
[time=2546] Do you know the word "create" in chapter 51 verse 10 is the same word in Genesis 1-1 in the beginning God created.
[time=2555] It's the Hebrew word "barah," B-A-R-A, that literally means God created something from nothing.
[time=2562] He created matter from non-matter.
[time=2564] It's called extrahilo.
[time=2566] God created something from nothing in Genesis 1-1.
[time=2570] And here David uses the same word.
[time=2572] He says, "God, would you do your same miraculous work that you did back at creation and create in me something that isn't there and create in me something that's new?
[time=2583] And that is a clean heart.
[time=2585] And that confession and that clean heart is what brings our peace and a steadfast spirit.
[time=2593] Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[time=2597] Confession renews our peace." Do you know that God is a God of peace?
[time=2603] And the fruit of the spirit is peace, and nothing tears a peace inside of us like unconfessed sin.
[time=2610] But confession renews our peace.
[time=2614] Secondly, the very next verse, verse 11, it returns our intimacy.
[time=2619] David said this, "Do not cast me away from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me." David was literally saying, "God, I want to sit at your feet.
[time=2627] I want to be in your presence.
[time=2628] I want to have the intimacy that we once had that was separated by sin, but now with a clean heart and a steadfast spirit, I want that intimacy back.
[time=2640] Please don't send me away from your presence, and our intimacy will return because of confession.
[time=2649] A pure and genuine confession will renew our peace and return our intimacy.
[time=2654] It also will restore our joy.
[time=2656] In verse 12, "Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me."
[time=2664] Again, joy is the life of a believer.
[time=2668] It's the fruit of the spirit, and we have Jesus Christ living in us and the Holy Spirit residing in us.
[time=2673] We are people of joy.
[time=2675] We can be joyful because of the incredible work God has done, and because of the peace that we can have in relationship with God the Father through his Son.
[time=2683] But just like peace, joy is destroyed by unconfessed sin.
[time=2689] But confession restores that joy.
[time=2693] John 15, 11 says this, "I have told you this is so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete."
[time=2703] Also, James 4, 9 and 10.
[time=2708] I believe that's on the screen as well.
[time=2710] James 4, 9 and 10 says, "Grieve and mourn, but let your mourning be turned to joy because that is the life of a believer."
[time=2718] So, "Blessed is the man whose transgressions are forgiven." That's how David started Psalm 32 because the joy is restored.
[time=2728] And lastly, verse 13 of Psalm 51, "Then I will teach transgressors your ways and sinners will turn back to you."
[time=2737] Verse 15, "O Lord, open my lips and my mouth will declare your praise." Here's the beautiful thing about confession.
[time=2745] Not only does it renew our peace, return our intimacy, restore our joy, but it also restores our ability to teach others who have had the same experience as we.
[time=2756] Listen, there's no more powerful teacher or instructor than when a parent who has experienced the grace of God
[time=2765] and confession before a holy God, that is a powerful instructor in front of children.
[time=2771] Think of other biblical characters. Of course, David experienced this great sin, but also confessed it.
[time=2780] And here we are today talking about the words David wrote.
[time=2784] He wrote most of the Psalms and we're talking about King David today.
[time=2789] Peter, after he denied Jesus. Do you remember what happened to Peter?
[time=2793] He confessed that sin and how did God use him?
[time=2797] He preached a sermon in the early church in the first century and 3,000 people came to Jesus Christ,
[time=2803] came to faith in Jesus Christ because of Peter's work.
[time=2806] And that was after he had sinned and denied Christ and sought his forgiveness and confessed it.
[time=2811] And then Paul, think of Paul's life.
[time=2816] That's a beautiful picture of how Paul's experience in his sin once turned around
[time=2823] and confessed to God and repented of Paul, the author of two thirds of the New Testament.
[time=2828] Paul, the quintessential church planter in the early church, the first century Christian church.
[time=2835] Paul was using a mighty way to teach. And as we confess, as we get on our face before God
[time=2842] and agree with God that our sin is sin, and when we repent and turn from that, we renew that ability to teach.
[time=2852] I'd ask Corbin and the team to come up and lead us in some songs of repentance and confession.
[time=2858] And as they're coming, I want you to look at one more verse from Psalm 51.
[time=2863] It's verses 16 and 17. Here's how David wrapped up his thoughts as he confessed and repented of his sin.
[time=2871] He said this, "You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it.
[time=2876] You do not take pleasure in burnt offering. David was full well aware of the Old Testament sacrificial system for sin.
[time=2883] And he's saying here, "In light of my sin, I know today is not the day you want me to bring a sacrifice, a lamb, and put it on the altar."
[time=2891] But here's what he said, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart. Oh God, you will not despise."
[time=2909] You know, it's meditating on those very words this week.
[time=2914] Matter of fact, I was driving home one afternoon this week down Maysville Road, heading to the interstate to go home.
[time=2920] It was about 5 or 5.30, and I was thinking about why did David say that?
[time=2926] Why did he say that the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit and a broken heart?
[time=2932] Why is that so appealing to God? Why does God look at that state?
[time=2937] Look at us in that state and smile, and why does that bring pleasure to him?
[time=2943] And driving down Maysville Road, the thought just occurred to me.
[time=2947] And that brings pleasure to our Father because of the incredible cost that it cost him and his son.
[time=2957] The precious shed blood of Jesus that paid the price for my sin and for yours.
[time=2964] And when our heart is broken and our spirit is crushed because of our sin,
[time=2973] he unleashes God's grace, and he pours it out on us, and he accomplishes his will in us,
[time=2980] and he does his work through us just because of a broken and contrite heart.
[time=2987] Corbin is going to lead us in some songs of confession, but here's what I want to invite you to do.
[time=2992] We'll stand together in a moment, but maybe you're at the place in your life where you know your way outside of that circle of safety.
[time=3002] And you want to say, "God, I want to confess that I want to agree with you.
[time=3007] I want to turn from that. I want to be right with you.
[time=3011] I invite you to come right down and kneel right here in one of the steps and just pray a prayer of confession.
[time=3018] Maybe it's a broken relationship.
[time=3021] Maybe it's an unresolved conflict that's divided a family member or you from a sibling.
[time=3026] And you want to confess that today? Would you come and invite you to come and pray a prayer of confession right here, as we sing?
[time=3034] Maybe it's an addiction, and it's got you in its grasp.
[time=3039] And you want to confess that and say, "God, that's not where I want to be.
[time=3044] Would you come and invite you?" There's nothing special or magical about coming down here and praying that black oak ministry.
[time=3053] But would you allow us to pray with you and to encourage you, as the body of Christ, wrap our arms around you and say, "We're with you.
[time=3062] We've experienced God's grace. Come and experience God's grace." Would you do that? I invite you to come and pray right now.
[time=3083] [MUSIC]
[time=3104] I hear the sick you sing, thy strength indeed is small.
[time=3113] Child, the weak, there's what you pray.
[time=3118] Find in me thy all in all.
[time=3123] Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe.
[time=3133] Sin had left the crimson stain.
[time=3137] He lost it wide as hell.
[time=3142] [MUSIC]
[time=3158] O now indeed I find thy heart and light alone.
[time=3167] Can change the upper spots and melt the heart of stone.
[time=3177] Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe.
[time=3186] Sin had left the crimson stain.
[time=3190] He washed it wide as stone.
[time=3195] [MUSIC]
[time=3211] And when before the throne, I stand in Him complete.
[time=3220] Jesus died by soul to save.
[time=3225] My lips shall still redeem.
[time=3230] Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe.
[time=3239] Sin had left the crimson stain.
[time=3244] He lost it wide as stone.
[time=3248] Would you stand with us, and we're going to sing that verse one more time.
[time=3252] And when I stand before the throne, I stand in Him complete.
[time=3257] He died to save our souls, and so we'll sing forever that Jesus paid it all.
[time=3263] Sing that in verse again together.
[time=3267] And when before the throne, I stand in Him complete.
[time=3276] Jesus died by soul to save.
[time=3287] Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe.
[time=3295] Sin had left the crimson stain.
[time=3299] He washed it wide as stone.
[time=3304] Sin had left the crimson stain.
[time=3308] He washed it wide as stone.
[time=3389] Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe.
[time=3414] Sin had left the crimson stain.
[time=3418] He washed it wide as stone.
[time=3423] Oh Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe.
[time=3433] My sin had left the crimson stain.
[time=3438] He washed it wide as stone.
[time=3453] [AMEN]
[time=3461] Remember these words, the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart.
[time=3467] Oh God, you will not despise.
[time=3469] Would you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3471] Father, we are so thankful today for your incredible, incredible grace.
[time=3478] Grace that is greater than all my sin.
[time=3482] And grace and mercy that is fresh with each new dawn and each new day.
[time=3487] God, that's the kind of God you are.
[time=3490] You are the kind of God that we love to worship.
[time=3493] You are the kind of God that we love to walk with in faith and obedience.
[time=3497] And Lord, as we step outside that circle of safety and we will because we are frail and we are human and we are weak.
[time=3505] I pray that your grace and love and mercy would draw us back.
[time=3509] I pray that we would have a Nathan in our life and that we would be willing to be a Nathan.
[time=3514] And then Lord, as we experience the incredible power of confession that unleashes your grace,
[time=3520] where you use us in mighty ways to do your work for your kingdom.
[time=3526] And now I pray these things in Jesus' strong and precious name, amen.
[time=3550] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
