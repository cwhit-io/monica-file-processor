[time=30] Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in Heaven
[time=58] and on earth; therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of
[time=70] the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=81] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=92] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=116] So, the first no while the angels did say, was to send and pour shall once it feels as they may, in fields where they, like he beeth their sheep.
[time=146] On a call we'll decide and want us to be, no where, no where, no where, no where, no where, no where is the king of Israel.
[time=176] They look at us, and saw us are shining in peace, beyond death far, and to the earth, He gave great light.
[time=205] As so it continued, those day and night, no where, no where, no where, no where, no where, no where.
[time=224] No where is the king of Israel.
[time=241] Let us all be proud of all.
[time=249] Sing praises to our heavenly Lord, and every man, and earth of God.
[time=266] And with His blood, and God, and God, no where, no where, no where, no where, no where.
[time=284] All is the Greek of Israel.
[time=294] Thank you, you may be seen.
[time=297] This is how Jesus the Messiah was born.
[time=301] His mother Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph.
[time=305] But before the marriage took place, while she was still a virgin, she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=313] Joseph, her fiance, was a good man, and did not want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break the engagement quietly.
[time=326] As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream.
[time=330] "Joseph, son of David," the angel said.
[time=334] Do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child within her was conceived by the Holy Spirit.
[time=343] She will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
[time=351] All this occurred to fulfill the Lord's message through his prophet.
[time=356] Look, the child will conceive, the virgin will conceive a child, and she will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel, which means God is with us.
[time=377] [MUSIC][MUSIC] Joyful and dry all bright [MUSIC][MUSIC] O come me [MUSIC][MUSIC] To bring me [MUSIC][MUSIC] Come and be [MUSIC][MUSIC] Born the king of the wind [MUSIC][MUSIC] O come, let us adore you [MUSIC]

[time=606] Thank you, be seated.
[time=613] Beth asked me if I'd be willing to do a painting, to listen to a song and just paint whatever came into my mind.
[time=622] And as soon as she told me the title, "For unto us a child is given," I saw a little boy just kind of running through a field happily.
[time=630] It's a sunny day.
[time=632] That's all I saw.
[time=634] And then later, when I actually listened to the song, I saw the rest of it.
[time=638] I saw this little boy, Jesus, running toward his father, Joseph.
[time=643] And his father, Joseph, just reaches down and scoops him up into his safe and loving arms.
[time=652] Whenever I'm faced with a painting, I usually ask God to help me, to show me what to paint.
[time=658] I really want my work to honor him.
[time=660] For me, it is an act of worship.
[time=662] You know, when I go outside and I look at nature, I'm just in awe, and I think a lot of people, when they see things like that, they think of a song and they write music, they play musical instruments.
[time=673] And for me, I often see pictures.
[time=676] There's a verse in Romans, chapter 1, verse 20, that I appreciate a lot.
[time=681] It says, "For since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse." When I heard the music, it was just so inspiring.
[time=697] It was just so filled with joy.
[time=699] And it reminded me of how joyful a time this is,
[time=705] because the long-awaited Messiah has finally come.
[time=708] And there is much to be joyful about.
[time=710] So I really tried to express the joy in this painting, and the joy of just the relationship between the child and the Heavenly Father.
[time=719] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=784] And the government shall be upon his shoulders.
[time=789] And his name shall be called.
[time=792] Wonderful.
[time=794] And his name shall be called.
[time=797] Councillor.
[time=799] The King of Kings.
[time=801] The everlasting Father.
[time=804] The
[time=817] little boy also represents me.
[time=822] I'm that little child that needs to have a loving father to run to.
[time=827] Because of Jesus, I can run directly to having my father whenever I need him.
[time=833] Whenever I need him, I want to.
[time=835] [MUSIC - 118 seconds]
[time=957] As a mother for children through the years, I had run to the Father a lot.
[time=966] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=979] They ought to do it.
[time=981] Oh, there's one more thread.
[time=982] Honey, where is Chris?
[time=983] I need him to try this on before the program.
[time=985] Well, he was here just a second ago.
[time=987] Chris.
[time=988] Who is that?
[time=989] Boy.
[time=990] Chris.
[time=994] Hey, ma'am, what do you want?
[time=995] Come down here right now.
[time=997] I need you to try this class, too, ma'am.
[time=999] This is such a special-- No, do I have to?
[time=1001] Yes, and hurry.
[time=1003] We don't have much time.
[time=1005] This is such a special night.
[time=1007] Chris playing Joseph in the Nativity Play at Church.
[time=1010] I know.
[time=1011] He's the last of the three to participate.
[time=1013] Oh, so sad.
[time=1015] Why?
[time=1016] My babies are all grown up.
[time=1018] Oh, come on, Linda.
[time=1019] Don't go there.
[time=1021] They've grown up so fast, Ned's in college, and Jenny's-- Hey, what's happening?
[time=1025] Hey, Jenny.
[time=1026] Mentally disturbed.
[time=1027] Are we about ready to go?
[time=1029] Yes, and hurry, and go get dressed.
[time=1032] Hurry, quick.
[time=1033] Uh, ma, I am dressed.
[time=1035] Oh, no, no.
[time=1036] If you think you are going to wear that to the-- Linda, Linda, let's not make a scene.
[time=1040] Make a scene?
[time=1041] She is a scene.
[time=1043] Linda, it's Christmas.
[time=1046] Okay, okay.
[time=1047] Where is Chris?
[time=1049] Chris, come on.
[time=1052] On the way, it's snowing out there.
[time=1054] It's probably going to take us an hour to get to church.
[time=1056] It's going to take that long to get out of the driveway.
[time=1058] Hey, man.
[time=1059] That long, huh?
[time=1060] Yeah, worse.
[time=1061] Oh, sorry.
[time=1063] It took me 30 minutes to get from Janet's house.
[time=1065] Oh, my goodness.
[time=1066] Well, I always have love to white Christmas.
[time=1068] You have.
[time=1071] Well, do I have to do this?
[time=1072] This is stupid.
[time=1074] Yes, now Chris, there can't be an activity play without Joseph.
[time=1078] It's true.
[time=1081] I don't know.
[time=1082] I hate wearing these sandals in the stupid dress.
[time=1085] Oh, come on, Chris.
[time=1087] You'll look cute in it.
[time=1090] I'll get it.
[time=1092] No.
[time=1093] Hello?
[time=1094] Who is it?
[time=1095] Yeah, I just got out of it.
[time=1096] Who is it?
[time=1097] Oh, really?
[time=1098] That's too bad.
[time=1099] Wait.
[time=1100] Okay.
[time=1101] Bye.
[time=1102] Who loves it?
[time=1103] Guess what?
[time=1104] What?
[time=1105] That was Mr. Farley.
[time=1106] He is called "Let's Build a Cancelling the Service." Thank you.
[time=1109] Thank you.
[time=1111] You got lucky.
[time=1112] All roads are either closed or impassable.
[time=1114] Oh, I am so disappointed.
[time=1116] Chris will never get to play Joseph in the Nativity play.
[time=1119] Thank you.
[time=1120] He could flunk with a strong possibility.
[time=1123] Christmas Eve just won't be the same now.
[time=1126] Oh, my-- How in all the work I put into making this costume?
[time=1130] Well, I'm going to get your picture in it anyway.
[time=1132] Here, put it on.
[time=1133] Oh, my mom, this is stupid.
[time=1135] It is not stupid, Chris.
[time=1137] Come on.
[time=1138] Now, Chris, this isn't stupid.
[time=1139] Put it on.
[time=1141] All of you kids have participated in the Christmas pageant.
[time=1144] Now, it's become a family tradition.
[time=1147] That's right.
[time=1148] No, I know.
[time=1150] Ned was a wise man.
[time=1152] Until he went to college.
[time=1154] All right.
[time=1155] And Jen was an angel.
[time=1156] Oh, no comment.
[time=1158] And you guys know even your mom participated when she was a kid?
[time=1162] Hmm.
[time=1163] She was a member of the chair of him choir.
[time=1165] Really?
[time=1166] Glooooo!
[time=1168] Mom, mom, mom.
[time=1169] Thanks.
[time=1170] You got the picture.
[time=1171] Chris, that was a long time ago.
[time=1172] What were you, Dad?
[time=1173] Well, I was-- Oh, now your father.
[time=1176] Your father was the star of the program.
[time=1178] So you were baby Jesus?
[time=1180] (LAUGHTER) No.
[time=1183] Like your mom said, I was the star.
[time=1185] You mean as in twinkle, twinkle?
[time=1187] The same.
[time=1188] They wrapped me up in foil and tinsel and sat me on top of a 20-foot ladder.
[time=1192] Oh.
[time=1193] There.
[time=1194] Now, let's have a look at you.
[time=1196] Oh, sweetie.
[time=1197] You look great, doesn't he?
[time=1199] Yes.
[time=1200] Yes, he does.
[time=1201] Let's see.
[time=1202] I have an idea.
[time=1203] What's that?
[time=1204] Let's have an activity play of our own.
[time=1205] Yes.
[time=1206] Oh, no.
[time=1207] Oh, come on.
[time=1209] We can't have it.
[time=1210] It's true.
[time=1211] Let's just have it right here.
[time=1212] What do you say?
[time=1213] No, thanks, Mom.
[time=1214] Once was enough for me.
[time=1215] Yeah.
[time=1216] Oh, come on.
[time=1217] It'll be fun.
[time=1218] Oh.
[time=1219] Chris will be Joseph.
[time=1220] Yeah.
[time=1221] You can be Mary.
[time=1222] And Ned will be the donkey.
[time=1225] Yeah.
[time=1226] No.
[time=1227] (LAUGHTER) The innkeeper.
[time=1229] Yes.
[time=1230] Yeah.
[time=1231] And honey, you can be-- I'll be the director.
[time=1233] I'll be the director.
[time=1234] What about you?
[time=1235] What are you going to be?
[time=1236] Oh, I'm going to be the costume designer.
[time=1238] The what?
[time=1239] Let me go get some towels and robes.
[time=1240] Mom, that's not fair.
[time=1241] Right, Ned.
[time=1242] Yeah.
[time=1243] Why do we have to turn us up stupid?
[time=1244] Yeah.
[time=1245] You and Mom don't have to.
[time=1248] Because we're the parents.
[time=1250] And you're the kids.
[time=1251] Dad, don't make me feel weird.
[time=1253] Oh, now, come on.
[time=1254] Oh, my.
[time=1255] This is really, really important to your mom.
[time=1257] Besides, it's probably the last time you'll ever have to do it.
[time=1260] Oh, can we have that in writing and notarized?
[time=1262] Yes.
[time=1263] Okay, here we go.
[time=1264] A head covering and robe for me.
[time=1266] Right.
[time=1267] Mom, if I put this thing on my head, it's going to mess up my hair.
[time=1270] Oh, honey.
[time=1271] It's going to do better than that.
[time=1272] It's going to cover it up.
[time=1274] Ned, your robe.
[time=1276] Okay, places everybody.
[time=1277] Quiet on the set.
[time=1279] Okay.
[time=1280] Chris, why don't you start us off with your first line?
[time=1283] Dad, I don't have any line that's narrated, remember?
[time=1286] Oh, yeah.
[time=1287] Right.
[time=1288] I'll tell you what.
[time=1289] I'll get us started with something here.
[time=1290] Hold on just a second.
[time=1292] Ah, let's see.
[time=1293] Where do we want to go?
[time=1295] Here we go.
[time=1296] Luke.
[time=1297] And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, unto the city
[time=1304] of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was the house and lineage of David.
[time=1310] To be taxed with Mary, his espoused wife, who was great with child.
[time=1315] Okay, Mary, here we are.
[time=1319] This is Bethlehem.
[time=1320] Great.
[time=1321] Now, can you go find me a motel so I can have this baby?
[time=1325] Now?
[time=1326] What?
[time=1327] Like I get to pick the time.
[time=1329] Alright.
[time=1330] Guess I'll find room in a hotel over here.
[time=1336] Knock.
[time=1337] Knack.
[time=1338] Who's there?
[time=1339] Joseph.
[time=1340] Joseph, who?
[time=1341] Ned, come on.
[time=1343] Sorry.
[time=1346] May I help you?
[time=1348] Yes.
[time=1349] I'm Joseph.
[time=1350] Mary and we're traveling a long way and we want a room to stay for that.
[time=1355] Oh.
[time=1356] Oh yeah, she's pregnant.
[time=1357] Okay.
[time=1358] We're all filled up.
[time=1360] We have a stable in the back that you can use.
[time=1361] Okay.
[time=1362] That'll do it.
[time=1363] Great.
[time=1364] That'll do it.
[time=1365] I don't want to have a baby in a barn.
[time=1366] Mom, she's ruining it.
[time=1367] I have not ruined it.
[time=1368] Who wants to have a baby in a barn?
[time=1370] Alright.
[time=1371] You too.
[time=1372] Hey.
[time=1375] How about I just read the rest of the story?
[time=1377] Great.
[time=1378] That's a great idea.
[time=1379] Oh, wait.
[time=1380] Let's get a picture first.
[time=1381] Okay.
[time=1382] Yeah.
[time=1383] Everybody in front of the table.
[time=1384] Come on, Jenny.
[time=1385] Honey, can I thank you?
[time=1386] Come on.
[time=1387] Everybody have fun here.
[time=1388] Come on.
[time=1389] Gather in Ned.
[time=1390] You scoot out there.
[time=1393] Off me.
[time=1394] Okay.
[time=1395] Ready?
[time=1396] One, two.
[time=1399] Oh, you guys, come on for real now.
[time=1401] Say cheese.
[time=1403] Cheese.
[time=1407] That's so bad.
[time=1409] Thank you.
[time=1412] And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.
[time=1420] And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
[time=1426] And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them and they were so afraid.
[time=1434] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold.
[time=1439] I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people.
[time=1442] For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior which is Christ the Lord.
[time=1449] And this shall be a silent to you.
[time=1451] He shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.
[time=1455] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
[time=1461] "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, good will, twerkmen." Well, I don't know if you remember me or not.
[time=1472] I'm one of the kids they brought in from the home.
[time=1480] I was a red-haired boy in an old green flannel shirt.
[time=1486] You may not have seen me, I was standing off the low.
[time=1492] I didn't come and talk to you 'cause that's never worked before.
[time=1499] And you'll probably never read this letter anyway.
[time=1506] But just in case there's something you can do to help me out, I'll ask you one more time.
[time=1517] All I really want for Christmas is someone to talk to you.
[time=1523] A shoulder to cry on if I lose, shoulders to ride on if I win.
[time=1530] There's so much I could ask for, there's just one thing I need.
[time=1536] All I really want for Christmas is a family.
[time=1551] Well, I guess I should go ahead and tell you now.
[time=1562] If it's really true about that list you have, somehow I always seem to end up in a fight.
[time=1576] But I'm really trying hard not to be bad.
[time=1582] Maybe if I had a brother or a dad to wrestle with, maybe they could teach me how to get
[time=1592] along.
[time=1593] And from everything I've heard, sounds like the greatest gift on earth would be a mom.
[time=1605] All I really want for Christmas is someone to touch me in.
[time=1611] A shoulder to cry on if I lose, shoulders to ride on if I win.
[time=1619] There's so much I could ask for, there's just one thing I need.
[time=1625] All I really want for Christmas is someone who will be here to save me happy birthday
[time=1634] for the next 100 years and it's okay if they're not right, believe in if they're a little
[time=1646] different.
[time=1651] All I really want for Christmas is someone who will be here to save me happy birthday.
[time=1662] So, I really want for Christmas is someone to touch me in.
[time=1671] There's so much I could ask for, there's so much I could ask for, there's just one thing
[time=1685] I need.
[time=1686] All I really want for Christmas is someone who will be here to save me happy birthday.
[time=1695] So, Christmas is a family, a friend, a child, a child, a child, a child, a child, a child,
[time=1722] a child.
[time=1733] Wow, good morning and what a joy to get to be here for just a few more minutes and to
[time=1739] just take these minutes to just reflect on this past month and study that we've been
[time=1745] in the discussion that we've been in over these last several weeks.
[time=1750] Most of you who are part of the Blackhawk family and for those of you that aren't, let me just catch up real quick, we came into December with the idea and the hope that we could just give some time and some attention to some of the symbols of Christmas.
[time=1764] Some of those things that we naturally just because we're who we are and we live where we live and we've kind of grown up the way we've grown up and part of it's kind of been tradition and other parts of this study and discussion have been very scriptural but the fact of the matter is there are certain symbols that we associate with Christmas and we have found as we've made our way through the study that there's great spiritual significance in these things and there have been some great take-homes, some great take-aways for all of us to give thought to as we've studied and looked at the symbols of Christmas.
[time=1799] It was several weeks ago, first Sunday in December, that we jumped into this and we started
[time=1806] with the symbol of the angel and some of you were here, some of you may not have been,
[time=1813] but the idea was we kind of studied what the Scriptures said about angels and had a great
[time=1820] look into the word of God as to who they are and why God made them and the purpose that
[time=1826] they serve and while we taught on angels, Sarah who you saw this morning on the video
[time=1832] just did a remarkable job of painting this while we taught that morning and it was such
[time=1838] a great picture not only the pictures she painted but what she did as well, such a great illustration
[time=1844] of what we kind of landed on when it came to angels, humble, quiet, selfless service.
[time=1853] They're messengers we learned and it was a great opportunity that morning to be reminded as Sarah quietly went about bringing her offering of worship to God.
[time=1865] As she painted, we were reminded that they are quiet, humble servants of God who protect
[time=1871] and who guide and who remind and they carry messages and they do a number of things, all
[time=1878] of which, greatly important and it gave all of us a great reminder, I think a great picture of what angels do and how we can in many ways, though not in all ways, but in many ways we can follow suit.
[time=1890] So angels was week one, second week we came to bells and we talked about how all of us
[time=1897] we all ring, we all ring bells and this was an actual, this bell right here actually is from Iida Tofolo who over 30 years ago started our school and she used to ring this actual
[time=1909] bell in the classroom on the playground.
[time=1913] It was amazing the morning that we taught on this when I read it, I saw about 10 alumni's
[time=1919] heads immediately jerk when they heard the bell, it was incredible, it was like it was a blast from the past and this was the, the bottom line on the bell was my friends that
[time=1930] we all ring out a message.
[time=1935] It was the morning I told you about my incident at the intersection there, I have never received so many Harley-Davidson Christmas gifts in my whole life.
[time=1945] But the fact of the matter is all of us send out a message every single day, every moment
[time=1951] of every day we communicate, a message sounds forth from us and what a great reminder, what
[time=1959] a great reminder for each and every one of us this season to try to be those who would
[time=1965] in our humble service be willing to send out messages of truth and hope and kindness.
[time=1974] The following week we found ourselves right in the middle of CWB, Christmas with Black
[time=1980] Ock and the intent all along that Corbin had was to just kind of continue in this symbols
[time=1986] of Christmas discussion and so the way the CWB opportunity was packaged there were three
[time=1994] symbols, if you were here you'll remember that we had a chance to talk about and we had a chance to just kind of look into the scriptures regarding the, some of the basic truths that come with this idea of the stalking, the stalking helped us realize Romans 3.23
[time=2012] for all have sinned, the stalking helped us see our need.
[time=2017] If you want to say it this way the stalking really in that discussion we came to terms with what we deserve and it was pretty clear I think for most of us and the scriptures
[time=2027] are very clear as to what we in and of ourselves deserve, the stalking talked about our need
[time=2033] and then we talked about snow and how snow is like forgiveness, how the snowfall of God's
[time=2042] grace has an uncanny way, a miraculous way of covering our defects and not just covering
[time=2050] them but we talked about how in the psalms our sins are removed as far as the east is from the west.
[time=2056] It's like throwing our sins into the deepest part of the sea God says, stockings talked about our need, snow kind of painted this picture of God's forgiveness and his grace and then
[time=2068] we looked thirdly during CWB at the star and how the star in a miraculous way pointed
[time=2076] people, specifically in the story the star points the Magi toward Christ and we talked
[time=2082] about how God uses things and people and circumstances and events to shine his light
[time=2089] to point us toward faith.
[time=2093] And I just I want to say this to you this morning I kind of wanted to I wanted to wait until we were just kind of together as a family.
[time=2101] Maybe this will make sense to you maybe it won't.
[time=2103] I think sometimes in the midst of CWB when there's so many other people around which we're very thankful for it's I feel a little different about it and though we gave thanks
[time=2114] and though we applauded and I don't necessarily want us to do that again this morning I just wanted to since we're here as family I just wanted to say to all of you I want to make sure that you understand I think most of you do but I just wanted to just take a moment
[time=2130] little digression here I just hope that you're really really thankful for the effort that
[time=2138] our team gave I don't know that you would have any ability to comprehend what I've heard
[time=2146] in the last week the amount of emails that have come in the amount you know the cards
[time=2152] the letters the emails the phone calls you know because I share with you that oftentimes because of the opportunity God has given our ministry in this community be it through Sunday mornings or the broadcast that you know that oftentimes I hear from people I have not ever
[time=2168] heard from people to the degree that we've heard on this one.
[time=2173] And I just want you to know we're already hearing story after story of God's redeeming work in the lives of people we're hearing story after story of how God used this effort
[time=2184] CWB to deeply impact and encourage people in their lives and from you know Corbin's leadership
[time=2191] to you know his wife Tanya and the you know the effort that she gave there portraying
[time=2198] Mary their commitment you know as a couple to work so hard and give so much time the
[time=2205] entire drama team the band the orchestra the singers the choir the Beth Armstrong and her
[time=2213] team that worked so hard and they continued to work hard to just visually and aesthetically bring honor to God through our efforts inside this room the whole team add and Brandon I just I just want you to stay quiet if you would on this I just want you in here to be really really grateful and any chance you would have to thank any of them I just want
[time=2234] to encourage you to do so if you're not one for letters maybe you might want to write one if you aren't you know very good on the email thing you might want to just take a few minutes and send one off but go out of your way to just appropriately thank them for what they did I'm so encouraged by what we saw so angels and bells and the stocking and the snow and
[time=2257] the star and today we come to the final one and the final picture that we just want to
[time=2263] leave you with this morning is one of the table the dining room table and I don't know
[time=2273] if you can smell it out there but this is like a real turkey and and I think that's
[time=2279] a real cake and I didn't have breakfast and so this is very difficult for me not to does
[time=2286] anybody like the skin on a turkey oh I just want to I just want to eat all that skin right there I'm just gonna be honest with you those are real roles and this is a real dine very nice dining room table and I I wonder what comes to your mind when you see
[time=2304] this the hope is and the intent this morning is to talk to you just briefly about this
[time=2312] last symbol of Christmas and while the table is here and it's the visual I think what we're really after here is family family and I want to just encourage you briefly this morning
[time=2325] to give some thought to just a couple of things some families in this room this morning I'll
[time=2336] just try to resist doing this because there's so many the list could get really long so I'm
[time=2342] just give me some grace here and I understand that I'm just I'm trying to invite you to give some thought to some general principles families in this room this morning could probably
[time=2355] for the most part fall into three categories I'm just gonna say it that way and as you think about this table and as you think about those that would sit around this table those that would sit around the table in your own mind those that would sit around the table later today as you gather or tonight or tomorrow you know there are some families in the room that are healthy you're doing you're doing all right I don't mean perfect I mean there
[time=2382] are some families in the room and you're still at it you're facing challenges and your maybe
[time=2389] it's just the two of you maybe it's the seven of you maybe it's the ten of you I don't know how it all lays out but you may be a family and you may be keeping at it like maybe full
[time=2401] of ups and downs there may be some challenges with the kids you may still be learning things as a husband or a wife but the bottom line is that this Christ whose birth we celebrate
[time=2414] this weekend your relationship with him and your growing commitment to him leaves you
[time=2420] today in a place where you haven't arrived where there are still plenty of lessons to be learned but you are as a family you're together you're keeping at it you're learning
[time=2430] lessons you're really thankful for each other you're healthy and I just I just want to say
[time=2438] this to you this morning if that's you be so very very thankful don't let today go by tonight
[time=2449] you know whenever it is that you sit at your table do not let that opportunity go by without
[time=2456] looking each other in the eye and reaching out a hand or giving a hug don't let this opportunity
[time=2462] go by to be at a table and to look at each other dads look at moms moms look at dads parents
[time=2468] look at kids kids look back at parents and look at each other and say thank you just say
[time=2474] how grateful you are that you're still at it admit that you're not perfect identify
[time=2480] the things that you need to keep working on but just have the wherewithal to look at each other and to be so very very thankful for the fact that God and his grace is growing
[time=2491] you and teaching you thank him for the small group that you have thank him for the class that you're a part of thank him for the family of God that you're able to fellowship with thank him that he's doing what he's doing turkey smells really good I don't the turkeys
[time=2510] cooked I don't know if the carrots on a carotron cooked but the carrots are good we need a
[time=2518] little ranch dressing anybody have any ranch in your car are you like on your way on your way to lunch today go get it real quick hmm these are real wow that's real alright Philippians
[time=2539] one six let me just say this to you Paul said this he said I'm confident of this very
[time=2545] thing this is this is for those of you so thankful that he's growing you and that you're still at it Paul said I'm confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will perfect it he will stay faithful to growing you he will stay faithful to developing
[time=2565] you into the man into the woman into the young man young woman he will be faithful what he began in you he will complete and as you find yourself maybe in that first category this
[time=2576] morning be thankful for Philippians one six that what he started he will continue and
[time=2583] be so very committed to cooperate with him as he does that you know what secondly and
[time=2590] we're just being honest here right was just you and your heart mind before God there are
[time=2598] some in the room and your table has fallen upon hard times and and I just differentiate
[time=2609] a little bit between the hard times and the healthy not that you're not handling it well I'm just saying there are some in the room this morning and when you look at this table and you begin to envision all that it kind of represents and all the places we go with this nice neat tidy look your table your life isn't so neat it's not so tidy in fact maybe
[time=2633] this Christmas maybe even today as you look at this and think about your family you realize
[time=2639] how hard it will be for you tonight to sit at the table you know what maybe you're going
[time=2646] to have to end up sitting at about three tables as this weekend unfolds and maybe you didn't
[time=2653] choose that but maybe that's just the way it is you may be sitting at a at a different
[time=2659] table this year after years and years of sitting at another table you may be as you think about
[time=2666] the table and as you think about the family you may be having to deal with divorce you
[time=2673] may be having to deal with rebellion you know with kids you may be dealing with addiction
[time=2680] you may be dealing with separation loss conflict there's just all kinds of things that surface
[time=2689] especially at this time of year and as you think about your family God may have you in a place today where it's very very very difficult for you for a number of reasons maybe I mentioned
[time=2701] one or two maybe I missed it but I just want to say to you this if you're here today and
[time=2707] you know him if you're here today and you have a personal meaningful growing relationship
[time=2714] with this Christ whose birth we celebrate I want to remind you to hang on I want to remind
[time=2721] you that no matter how the table may look no matter what the family situation might be no matter what challenge you may be in the midst of I want to remind you of what that baby who grew up to be Christ the Lord said in John 16 in John 16 33 he said these things
[time=2738] I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace in the world you will have what
[time=2747] tribulation in this world on your journey as you face all the you and I face with family
[time=2754] and all that comes with that in this world your experience Jesus said and mine it will
[time=2760] be you will we will have in this world on this earth there will be times of tribulation
[time=2766] but what but take what say it loudly courage but take courage he says I have overcome the
[time=2775] world whatever challenge you might be facing whatever difficulty your your table may be in the midst of I just want to speak truth to you this morning I want to speak some Christmas
[time=2788] courage to you I want you to to be reminded this morning to hold on so very tightly to the one who came and gave his life for you he says no matter what you might be facing
[time=2799] no matter what the dilemma might be he says be courageous be courageous hold on tightly
[time=2808] not to your own strength and whatever you can muster but to me he says because I have whatever you're facing addiction divorce separation massive conflict at the table no
[time=2818] matter what the difficulty he says I have Christ has overcome it and you can to in me
[time=2827] he says in Christ he has overcome the world you know what there's a third category and
[time=2838] this third category might just be a few of you or maybe there's many I don't know on
[time=2845] this one but there may be some who have kind of gone past hard times to just flat out hopeless
[time=2855] there may be some in the room and I I start talking about the table and I'm I'm painting you know pictures of of kids and moms and dads and and being grateful and good food and fellowship
[time=2868] and times around the table and you may be sitting here this morning or you may be listening
[time=2874] at some other point in time and just say you know what there there isn't a picture that would be further from my reality there may be somebody or somebody's here today and when
[time=2886] you think about all of this there just may be something in you that can't even imagine this because you're so removed from it for whatever reasons it may have been your choices
[time=2899] it may have been the choices of another and I think for you this morning I just I want
[time=2905] to say this I can't say anything and we're not going to get anything done in the next few hours here you know here today what where you are today is is your reality but I want to remind you of this and I say this with all my heart and I say this with absolute and complete sincerity that if you're in that third category if you can't even begin to
[time=2925] imagine family love and devotion and a commitment to each other then I want to remind you of
[time=2935] what it is we celebrate this weekend we celebrate the birth of one who can bring to your heart
[time=2941] as distant or as cold as it might be relationship the one whose birth we celebrate is the one
[time=2949] who can bring to your heart the fellowship and the love and the joy and the contentment
[time=2956] of family and while your physical family may be long gone while your physical circumstance
[time=2963] may be messy I want to remind you this morning that there's room for you at this table there's
[time=2971] room for you in the family of God there's room for you in relationship with the one who came
[time=2979] so that you could have life and no matter how far gone you might be no matter how discouraging
[time=2985] it may be today no matter what you're facing I want to stand here and remind you that he loves you deeply my mind as I'm saying that my mind's just going to Psalm 23 I think is
[time=2999] where he says he prepares a what he prepares a table before me and he wants nothing more
[time=3009] than to know you and to love you and to forgive you and to bring meaning and purpose to your
[time=3016] today and hope and relationship with him forever and we can't let today go by without reminding
[time=3027] you of that whoever you are whatever it looks like no matter how dark it is he came and
[time=3034] he was born and he lived and died he defeated death so that you could have the forgiveness of your sins and hope and meaning for today and eternal life tomorrow and I want to invite
[time=3048] you this morning to think about that and I want to invite the rest of you I want to invite all of you if I can just read this for you if I can just read this for you and
[time=3058] let me just invite you to stand if you would just quietly I want just in honor of God's word I want to read one of my favorite Christmas passages and it's not in the gospels so many
[time=3070] of those passages in the gospels or it's just so incredibly special and I know all of us
[time=3076] love them and how they read the narrative there is just amazing I want to take you to another passage that describes in essence the very same thing and I just want this to be on your hearts this morning as we celebrate this great event together it's in Philippians two would you just listen I think it'll be on the screen and I just in honor of God's word thank you for standing and let me read this to you verse three says this do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit think about this today think about this tonight think about
[time=3107] this tomorrow morning kids young people old people think about this tomorrow morning do
[time=3114] nothing from selfishness or empty conceit but with humility of mind regard one another
[time=3123] is more important than yourselves do not merely look out for your own personal interests but
[time=3130] also for the interests of others have this attitude this attitude that he just describes
[time=3136] he says have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus who although he existed
[time=3142] in the form of God right absolute complete deity divinity total godliness he was in
[time=3151] the form of and had been for all of eternity prior in the form of God in the heavenlies
[time=3160] and thrown and it says he he didn't consider equality with God something to hold on to
[time=3166] who although he existed in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to
[time=3172] be grasped but emptied himself manger cave animals fourteen year old mother fifteen sixteen
[time=3186] year old dad king that was out to kill him people who would persecute him torture him
[time=3194] in the end murder him all of that he knowingly steps into did not regard equality with God
[time=3201] a thing to be grasped but he emptied himself taking the form of a bond servant a baby and
[time=3208] being made in the likeness of men being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself by
[time=3215] becoming obedient to the point of death even death on a cross for this reason also God
[time=3222] the father highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name
[time=3229] so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow of those who are in heaven and on earth
[time=3236] and under the earth it's a powerful statement right there we kind of read through that quickly
[time=3242] sometimes at the name of Jesus remember this every knee will bow right someday every knee
[time=3255] will bow of those who are in heaven those who are on earth and under the earth and that
[time=3266] every tongue verse 11 that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[time=3274] of God the Father good truth to give thought to a good attitude to have in mind and on
[time=3284] that note while you're thinking about that attitude that Christ had that we should have in ourselves that that attitude that thought of others that didn't think of himself that went out of his way to do for us what we could never have done for ourselves as you think about Philippians 2 as you read Luke 2 tonight or tomorrow I might encourage you to read Philippians 2 again and with that selflessness in mind I want you to remember
[time=3311] too as you think about this table don't forget the families in Darfur and Uganda and Ghana
[time=3324] other places in the world my friends who not only have never seen a table they wouldn't
[time=3336] they wouldn't know what this is don't forget the people across the world and you know in
[time=3342] some cases here in our own community don't forget those who've never seen a table don't
[time=3348] forget those who don't have family because their families have been beaten and tortured
[time=3355] and raped and separated and and they haven't seen each other for years and years and years because of the utter rebellion that exists in their countries don't forget those who have never seen a table don't forget those who won't not only will they not not only will
[time=3374] they not see I mean not only will they not eat this much food in a year they won't even
[time=3384] see this much food don't forget those as you open your presence who have absolutely nothing
[time=3399] and yet you and I are aware of many of them who while having absolutely nothing have absolutely
[time=3406] what everything and they are models to you and I of contentment and joy this baby who
[time=3414] came to bring peace there are some who know that at a level you and I would struggle to
[time=3420] even understand so I don't know what category you're in I hope whichever category I hope
[time=3428] what we've said this morning gives you hope and encouragement if there's anybody in the room this morning as we leave anybody that would just love it if an elder staff member would just take a moment and pray with you we'll do that we would love to spend a couple of minutes with you but thank you for being such a great family and thank you for the hope and the encouragement that you provide for so many of us and let me just pray for you and then we're going to go and some elders and staff if you're in the room just be sensitive to those who may come down to the front and we'll pray with you if you have any needs father God thank you thank you for the table and the picture that it paints a family and God for
[time=3469] all of us in the room regardless of where we may be in our family journey God I pray
[time=3476] that we that we would see this morning how clearly you offer hope how clearly you offer
[time=3482] forgiveness how clearly this morning you offer a road that we can walk with you from whatever
[time=3489] spot we may be in God you're the God that reconciles you're the one that brings hope and restoration God you can do miracles and families you can give those who are without
[time=3500] great comfort you can give those who are praying for families great encouragement God you can
[time=3507] help whatever picture God painted in the hearts and minds of people here this morning whatever
[time=3513] that looks like God we're so thankful that you can speak into that that you can continue
[time=3519] to give guidance and direction thank you for your son father God we thank you for the gift
[time=3526] that he represents in your son's name we pray amen.
