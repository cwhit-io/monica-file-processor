[time=574] We're gonna sing one more song together, Carrie and the choir, and I are gonna sing.

[time=589] And music like this is exciting because it inspires us to join in like we just did, but you know what, the reason we gather and the reason we're here and the reason we sing is not about this or not about us, but it's all about him and his great character.

[time=958] (audience applauds)
[time=969] Hey, we had an interesting beginning to our new year in our home this past week.
[time=975] It began last Sunday.
[time=977] Following church, we went on to lunch with some friends.
[time=979] Our nine-year-old Madison complained of a stomach ache on the way home.
[time=983] No big deal, we went to Don Pablo's, so to be expected.
[time=987] And that's not a knock on Don Pablo's.
[time=990] I just, you know, Mexican food, nevermind, forget it.
[time=994] It was good, it was a great lunch, but her stomach hurt on the way home, and then we got home, and then everything she ate, she lost in the toilet, and it was a flu, and the ache body, the whole nine yards, we thought.
[time=1004] Sunday turned into Monday, more vomiting, more ache body.
[time=1007] Monday turned into Tuesday, and the interesting thing on Tuesday was that when she would say that her stomach hurt, her hand went from her belly button, all of a sudden, over to her side.
[time=1017] And she said, "Mom, dad, my stomach hurts." And I'm like, "Why is she holding her ribs then?" And Tuesday, it got worse, and she's a tough little girl, too, high, high pain tolerance.
[time=1028] Didn't want to go to the doctor.
[time=1029] Certainly didn't want to go to the hospital.
[time=1031] And so she kind of figured it out that it maybe was heading that way, and she just got more and more determined, and by about three o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, she's telling her mom, "I'm fine." She got her teeth together, and she said, "I'm fine." And tears are running down her cheeks.
[time=1046] And so we took her to the doctor real quick, and the doctor set her down, and went to touch her down below the bottom rib on the right side.
[time=1053] Went to touch her, Deborah said the reflex was like, she was gonna hit her little brother.
[time=1057] It was like, it hurts so bad.
[time=1059] He just said, "Look, take her over to the hospital." We took her there.
[time=1063] Tuesday evening, her appendix had ruptured, and they rushed her into surgery, and it all went great, and they got it out, and it was a pretty decent-sized infection area that they had to clean out, and so they sewed her back up, and the doctor came out.
[time=1077] The surgeon came out, and does what any surgeon does.
[time=1080] It was just, it was just great.
[time=1082] He came out and explained what had happened.
[time=1083] He even, nowadays, they even bring you a picture.
[time=1086] Do you know how cool that is?
[time=1087] To see the inside of it, some of you are kind of shaking your head's no?
[time=1091] (audience laughs) I won't go any further.
[time=1093] It was very cool, though.
[time=1094] If you want to see it, I got it in my Bible.
[time=1096] (audience laughs) It's the actual appendix, and then he's showing you the hole where it bursts, and you can see all the infection, never mind.
[time=1103] It's really cool.
[time=1105] Shows us the picture, describes the surgery, says she's gonna be great, and then says what they always say.
[time=1109] She's in recovery, you'll be able to go back in about a half hour.
[time=1112] Someone will come and get you.
[time=1115] Well, you know, I've been through a lot.
[time=1117] You've all been through a lot.
[time=1118] We've been in spots, and it just kind of hit me in a way I didn't expect it to hit me.
[time=1123] I knew everything was fine, but gosh, I wanted to see her.
[time=1128] Does that make sense?
[time=1131] I just, all of a sudden, I mean, I waited maybe 10 minutes.
[time=1136] I knew he said 20, but I'm thinking, it's 11 o'clock at night.
[time=1139] Nobody who he thinks is gonna come tell us, they're all gone.
[time=1142] No one's gonna come tell us, and we're gonna sit here all night, and she's gonna be by herself.
[time=1146] And there was just something in me that just wanted to, I just wanted to see Maddie.
[time=1151] And it'd been 10 minutes, and so I just, you know, I don't know what I said, I just left.
[time=1156] The waiting room my wife and other kids were there, some friends were there.
[time=1159] I just watched it, I'll be back.
[time=1160] I just started walking in the hall.
[time=1162] I knew the general direction of surgery.
[time=1165] And I just was like a man on a mission, and I just started walking down hallways.
[time=1170] I started putting my head indoors.
[time=1172] I wasn't supposed to go in.
[time=1173] I started walking through quarters that said stay out.
[time=1176] You know?
[time=1177] I mean, I was gonna find her.
[time=1178] I just was going everywhere I could to try and find her.
[time=1181] It was late at night, and there weren't a lot of people around.
[time=1183] And I finally bumped into a guy from our church, Wes.
[time=1186] Akers is his name, and Wes works there at Parkview.
[time=1189] And he's like, "Hey, Kelly." And I described what had happened.
[time=1192] He said, "Hey, come with me." And Wes was kind enough to take me back, but through the right doors, to the right people, where they allowed me to go into this recovery area.
[time=1200] And there she was, just laying on her gurney.
[time=1203] Nobody in there.
[time=1204] Huge recovery room, two nurses, great gals.
[time=1208] And I could just see her red hair, you know, just laying back.
[time=1210] And it was like, "Boy, I felt good to just see her." And I thought, "Oh gosh, I better go get Deborah." And actually, Wes went back and got Deborah, and she came back there, and it was so good.
[time=1222] I just wanted to be with my daughter.
[time=1230] And it reminded me, in such a clear and powerful way, how from the very beginning of time, that's all God has ever wanted.
[time=1244] He has, from the very beginning of time, only wanted to be with his children.
[time=1251] You know, no sooner had we got into the room and gotten settled, and a day ahead gone by, maybe on the days are all foggy.
[time=1259] I've been, several nights this week, I've spent on a hospital caught.
[time=1265] And so I'm not real clear this morning.
[time=1267] I've lost track of days.
[time=1269] I woke up this morning thinking it was Friday, my day off.
[time=1272] And so I'm all confused, but no sooner had we got in there and gotten settled, but a good friend of ours came by.
[time=1279] And we were talking, her mom is in the hospital upstairs, and so she had come by to see Maddie.
[time=1284] And we started talking about this Sunday morning and the new series that we were beginning.
[time=1289] And I told her that the title of the series was the one thing God's always desired, the one thing God desires most.
[time=1296] I told her the series title was gonna be the one thing that God from the very beginning has desired over and above all else.
[time=1304] And she said, "You have got to read this story "in this book, it's at my house." And I was on my way home and she said, "Go by." And you know, I knew where the key was.
[time=1313] And she said, "Just go in, it's next to the piano "and the basket, big green book.
[time=1317] "Just grab it and read the first story." So I did.
[time=1319] And I've got to read it.
[time=1322] I've got to read it to you this morning.
[time=1324] And what a great reminder it is of our God and how from the very beginning of creation, creation, this amazing thing that he did, how from the very beginning he wanted nothing more than to be with you and me.
[time=1340] The father was dreaming.
[time=1343] I could see it in his eyes.
[time=1345] The sparkle, it was there again.
[time=1348] What is it you see, my king?
[time=1350] He didn't turn but kept his gaze fixed on the great emptiness.
[time=1354] The massive, boundless, unending space.
[time=1357] The more he looked, the more his eyes would dance.
[time=1360] I knew he saw something.
[time=1362] I looked in the same direction.
[time=1364] I leaned forward and stared intently and all I saw was emptiness.
[time=1370] All I ever saw was emptiness.
[time=1372] I hadn't seen the sphere that he had pulled out of the sky.
[time=1376] Where was that?
[time=1378] I asked as he began molding it and shaping it in his hands.
[time=1382] It was there, he replied, looking outward.
[time=1386] I looked and saw nothing.
[time=1387] When I turned he was smiling.
[time=1389] He knew a seraph's vision was too limited.
[time=1393] The same thing happened with the water.
[time=1395] Where did this come from?
[time=1396] I asked, touching the strange substance.
[time=1400] I saw it, Michael.
[time=1402] He chuckled as he filled an ocean from his palm.
[time=1406] And when I saw it, I made it.
[time=1408] I saw it there with the stars.
[time=1410] The what?
[time=1411] The stars, he said.
[time=1414] Out into the heaven, out into the void, he reached.
[time=1416] When he pulled back his hand, he kept it closed.
[time=1419] As if to entice me to lean forward, I did.
[time=1422] And just as my face was near, he opened his hand, opened it.
[time=1429] And a burst of light escaped, and I looked up just in time to see it illuminate his face.
[time=1434] Once again, he was smiling.
[time=1435] Watch how they sparkle, he reveled.
[time=1437] And with the flip of his wrist, the palmful of diamonds soared into the blackness until they found their destiny, and they were hung.
[time=1446] Won't the children love them?
[time=1449] The maker said, as together, we watched the twinkling begin.
[time=1454] I still wasn't sure what or who these children were.
[time=1458] But I knew they occupied a place in the dream, like nothing else.
[time=1462] Ever since the dream started, the father spoke often of these children, what they would be like, how they would respond.
[time=1469] I remember once the father held the sphere in one hand and motioned to me with the other.
[time=1474] Come see what the children will see.
[time=1478] He then put his fingers to his lips and blew gently off his fingertips, floated tiny whiffs of white cotton balls of fluff.
[time=1486] What do they do, I asked, as the train of puffs sailed toward the globe?
[time=1492] Oh, Michael, he boomed with excitement.
[time=1495] Oh, Michael, they do everything.
[time=1497] They give shade, they give rain.
[time=1500] But most of all, my children can watch them pass.
[time=1502] And if they look closely, they will see me.
[time=1507] That was the way he thought about everything.
[time=1508] All the dream was for the children.
[time=1512] And in all the dream was the father.
[time=1514] For the waterfall, he had said, I made it small so they could run in and out.
[time=1519] With the dandelion, he had said, this is just the right size for little children to blow.
[time=1525] And with the rivers in the canyon, he had said, they can sit right here and watch the water race into the valley.
[time=1532] But where are the children, I once asked, looking into the same space from whence had come the rest of the dream?
[time=1540] Oh, not out there.
[time=1542] He said, there was urgency in his voice as he repeated not out there.
[time=1550] But that is all the father said, and that's all I asked.
[time=1552] With the coming of the creatures, I almost forgot about the children.
[time=1557] We laughed so much as he made them.
[time=1559] Each one was special.
[time=1561] The tiny wing for the mosquito, the honk.
[time=1565] So unlike any other sound for the goose, the shell for the turtle, the darting eyes of the owl, he even let me decorate a few.
[time=1573] I put violet in the butterfly's wings, and he loved my idea to stretch the elephant's nose.
[time=1581] What fun it was as the heavens gave birth to foul and fish, reptile and rodent.
[time=1587] No more had the little ones scurried off his palm than the giant ones appeared.
[time=1593] He grabbed the giraffe and stretched out its neck, and he put a hole in the whale's head so it will come to the surface to breathe and the children will see it.
[time=1602] What will we call them all?
[time=1604] I asked, oh, oh, I'll leave that up to the children, he said, the children.
[time=1610] That's right, I had almost forgotten.
[time=1612] But he hadn't.
[time=1613] As the last winged, creature left his fingers, he turned and looked at me, and I knew.
[time=1618] It's time I said yes, it's time, he responded.
[time=1622] I expected to see his eyes dance again, but they didn't.
[time=1625] I anticipated eagerness, but he didn't begin.
[time=1627] For a long period, he sat looking out into the void longer than normal.
[time=1632] Do you see the children?
[time=1635] I asked, no.
[time=1638] They're not to be found out there.
[time=1640] Then what do you see?
[time=1642] I see their deeds.
[time=1644] He then spoke softly.
[time=1646] The joy was gone from his voice, what?
[time=1649] I asked, what is it?
[time=1650] What is it you see?
[time=1652] And perhaps it was because he thought I needed to know or maybe because he needed someone else to know.
[time=1659] I'm not sure why, but he did what he had never, ever done before, he let me see.
[time=1663] As if the sky were a curtain, he pulled it back
[time=1669] for both of us to gaze and before I could see it, I could smell it.
[time=1674] The stench stung my eyes.
[time=1676] It's greed, you smell, he explained.
[time=1680] A love for foolish and empty things.
[time=1683] I started to turn away, but my king didn't turn, so I didn't turn, I then looked again.
[time=1689] It was so dark, a darkness unlike the starless sky, a blackness, unlike the void.
[time=1694] This darkness moved, it crept, it shadowed and swayed.
[time=1699] It was a living soot.
[time=1701] He knew my thoughts and he spoke.
[time=1705] His words were slow and spaced.
[time=1708] They will put it out.
[time=1714] "What?" I asked.
[time=1717] They will destroy that which makes them mine.
[time=1722] It was then I saw it for the first time.
[time=1727] He reached into himself, he reached deep into his own self and pulled it out.
[time=1733] It was a flame, a shining circle, a light.
[time=1738] It glowed brilliantly in his palm, much brighter than the constellations he had spread about or the sun which he himself had ignited.
[time=1747] "This is, I began, this is part of me," he finished, and then added what I couldn't have ever imagined.
[time=1756] And out of me, I will make my children.
[time=1761] For the first time I saw, I saw and understood why the children were so treasured.
[time=1767] I saw the uniqueness in them.
[time=1769] They bore his light.
[time=1772] The universe he created, the children he fathered.
[time=1775] But the darkness I had to ask, why?
[time=1777] Why does it go that way just as I chose so must they choose?
[time=1783] Else they wouldn't be mine," he responded.
[time=1788] Just then his face lifted, his eyes brightened, but they won't all forget me.
[time=1794] Look, into tomorrow we gazed.
[time=1797] At first I saw nothing, just swarthy darkness billowing, but then as I searched I saw, first only one, then a cluster, then more, lights they were, flickers of candles, weakened, but not lost in the darkness, like the stars he had cast against the black heavens, these flames flickered in the sable sea.
[time=1817] It's my children, he said with pride in his voice.
[time=1821] My children remember the look on his face, I'll never forget, his eyes had sparkled when he suspended the planets in space.
[time=1829] His cheeks had danced as he heard the cat purr.
[time=1832] I had seen his face alive before, but not like this, for at this moment when he saw his children a light in the darkness.
[time=1841] When he saw those who were his seeking after him, he celebrated, his countenance exploded with joy.
[time=1849] His head flew back and laughter shook the stars.
[time=1853] My children, my children, my children were his only words, and then he paused, wiped the tears from his face and pledged a promise for all of heaven to hear.
[time=1866] You haven't forgotten me, I will never forget you.
[time=1870] Then he turned to me.
[time=1873] To the work, Michael, we've much to do, we must make the dream come true, and I thought making the animals was a delight.
[time=1881] No two of them will be alike, he vowed, as he began reaching into himself for balls of light.
[time=1889] Some will be big, he said.
[time=1892] Some small, some timid, some bold, some with big ears, some with little.
[time=1902] (audience laughing) See, I trust people with pictures around here, and look what they do to me.
[time=1912] (audience laughing) Some with big, yeah, yeah, okay, we saw it.
[time=1916] (audience laughing) They were all laughing first hour, I wasn't sure what was going on, now I do.
[time=1921] And off his palm, they came.
[time=1926] Generation chosen, destination determined.
[time=1930] Each with a different threat of character or shape of body, but each with a bit of him, a light within.
[time=1938] And he even let me help.
[time=1940] Look what I made, father, I told him.
[time=1941] I called him freckles, let me show you how they work.
[time=1946] And he smiled.
[time=1946] Got an amazing depiction from Max Locado.
[time=1953] It's called Tell Me the Story, A Story for Eternity.
[time=1957] And as I read that story, in my car, I just sat there in the driveway at this friend's house, just read through it, and was just struck again by the fact that from the very, very beginning, whether it's me in a waiting room or you, whether it's any of us in this room with those that we would love or God in eternity past, as he shapes and forms creation, he couldn't wait to be with his kids.
[time=1987] Genesis, one, one.
[time=1990] Sound familiar?
[time=1993] Most of you in the room can just say it with me.
[time=1995] And if you can, I just want you to say it with me.
[time=1997] Genesis, one, one, everybody together.
[time=1999] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=2004] In the beginning, my friends, way back here where this whole thing starts, it says that God created, God did.
[time=2012] Don't let anybody tell you differently.
[time=2015] God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=2019] And after Genesis, one, one, light and night, got made day, earth, land, seas, plants, vegetation and trees, as the days progressed, stars, the sun, the moon, animals in the sea, birds in the air, animals on the earth, the whole nine yards, he creates.
[time=2039] And after every one of those creations, after every one of those initial days, when he had created all that amazing stuff, he said it is what?
[time=2049] Good.
[time=2050] He said it is good.
[time=2053] But then we come to Genesis 1, 26.
[time=2057] Open your Bibles, please.
[time=2058] Genesis 1, 26, 27, 28 and 29.
[time=2063] And in honor of God's word, would you stand and let me read what we find here as this creation account continues to unfold.
[time=2071] And he comes to this place and time he had longed for from the very beginning of eternity past.
[time=2078] Then God said, let us make man in our image.
[time=2083] According to our likeness, our God, son, holy spirit, trinity that exists in eternity past.
[time=2091] God says, let us make man in our image.
[time=2093] According to our likeness and let them, man, rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
[time=2105] I mean, just as you read that, just begin to imagine all that he had for them, all that he longed to give them, to be with them, yes, but then to give them and to bless them and to provide them with this incredible unspeakable opportunity verse 27, God created man in his own image.
[time=2124] In the image of God, he created him male and female.
[time=2128] Remember that, he created them male and female,
[time=2135] different, designed uniquely by God.
[time=2140] He created them, God blessed them, verse 28.
[time=2144] And God said to them, be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on earth.
[time=2155] Then God said, behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, gave them everything.
[time=2162] And every tree which has fruit yielding seed and it shall be food for you.
[time=2168] And this won't be on the screen, but verse 31 says, God saw what he had done here with man and he said it was good.
[time=2179] No, he said it was what?
[time=2182] Very good.
[time=2183] God was finally going to be with them.
[time=2192] Wow.
[time=2192] Father God, we pray as we continue to look into this
[time=2200] unfolding story of what you have from the beginning always desired.
[time=2205] God, I pray that every heart and life in this room would in a new way, in a renewed way for some,
[time=2215] in a brand new way for others.
[time=2218] God, may hearts and souls and minds be open to this very basic but profound picture of that which you have desired most from the very beginning.
[time=2230] May we see it in all of its glory.
[time=2233] May we see it for all that it's worth.
[time=2236] May we see it, God, and may you and your spirit and your word do your life-changing work in us as we view that which you have longed for.
[time=2247] Thank you for the privilege of seeing it again.
[time=2251] Thank you for the privilege of studying your word and thank you, God, for the things that you will do because of our time here with you in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=2262] You can be seated.
[time=2262] God was finally going to be with them.
[time=2267] Found Maddie in the recovery room.
[time=2269] The search was over, boom, there we were.
[time=2272] And the degree to which he was, my friends, the degree to which he was with them.
[time=2281] The degree to which he shared and enjoyed relationship with them, the degree to which intimacy occurred is only seen really in the utter tragedy of chapter three.
[time=2295] It's like this one chapter in the Bible
[time=2301] that you just, you don't ever wanna, it's like you just wish there was a way we could not have Genesis three.
[time=2307] But the reality of it is he made us, he gave us choice and we had to choose or else we would never be who's his.
[time=2321] And so a choice is made in Genesis three and in the making of this choice with the entrance of sin into the picture.
[time=2330] It is only in the tragedy of chapter three that we're able to get a really clear picture on how utterly close he had actually been.
[time=2341] And I want you to see this with me, chapter three, verse six.
[time=2344] Before we start, God had been very clear with Adam and Eve.
[time=2348] God had been very, very clear.
[time=2351] There was no confusion about this.
[time=2353] He had given them you, read it.
[time=2354] He gave them the whole world.
[time=2356] He gave them everything.
[time=2357] He gave them the ability and the opportunity to rule and to reign.
[time=2362] And he said, just don't eat the fruit from this tree.
[time=2366] The day in which you eat from this tree, you will surely what?
[time=2371] Die.
[time=2373] That's all he said, don't eat from the fruit of this tree.
[time=2375] So the serpent comes Satan and the form of the certain comes has the conversation, literally with the woman, tempts her to go in a direction that God had not designed for her.
[time=2385] She, verse six, it says, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate words that are even hard now to read.
[time=2401] Sin, for the very first time, right there
[time=2408] on the face of the earth.
[time=2410] And she gave also to her husband with her husband
[time=2416] there to protect husband, there to nurture husband, there to lead husband, there to give his life and he ate.
[time=2425] Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
[time=2438] Sin enters the picture and it does,
[time=2444] now listen, and it does what sin always does.
[time=2449] I know there are many of you in the room this morning who know this.
[time=2452] I know there are many of you here today and you've experienced this and you've studied this and this is something that is not new to you.
[time=2458] You still, like me, need to hear this and be reminded of this.
[time=2462] There are others of you in the room and you might know this internally, but let me just say it to you this morning because it's just true, it's just the way it is.
[time=2471] Sin always separates that which was close.
[time=2476] Sin always distances what was close.
[time=2481] Separation occurs, you who were myself, anybody who was close to God in relationship with God, experiencing intimacy with God, sin comes and divides.
[time=2493] Sin always comes and separates.
[time=2496] Sin takes you and sin takes me and it moves us away from the relationship that God had long for and designed from the very beginning.
[time=2504] It always does.
[time=2508] Doesn't matter what the sin, go ahead, name it, name a sin.
[time=2510] Whatever the sin, it distances relationship.
[time=2514] It violates our relationship with God and others.
[time=2518] Sin's just an amazing thing.
[time=2519] I was thinking about it.
[time=2520] For instance, even on this front, why was I separated from Matty?
[time=2524] I mean, in the big picture, why was my little girl in surgery?
[time=2530] Why do we have bodies that are defective and not as they were intended to be?
[time=2535] Because of what?
[time=2537] Sin, sin, it separates us from God, it separates individuals from their maker, it separates husbands from wives, it separates parents from kids, it separates friends from other friends, it separates people, it creates division.
[time=2556] And I want you to see this morning, we've referred to this in the past, but I want you to see it just so very clearly today.
[time=2566] I want you to see how close.
[time=2568] I want you to see this morning, how intimate they really were with him.
[time=2574] I want you to see how far into their world, how far into their lives.
[time=2578] I want you to sense the heart of God this morning and the level at which he had longed to be with them, I want you to see what that really actually looked like before sin tears it apart, look at verse eight.
[time=2594] So they're hiding now, right?
[time=2596] They've made loin coverings, sin has entered.
[time=2599] Verse eight, they heard the sound, underline that, they heard the sound of the Lord God walking, actually heard the sound of him walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
[time=2620] Then the Lord God called to the woman.
[time=2623] Is that what it says?
[time=2624] No, both eight, who does the Lord God call out to?
[time=2629] The responsible one, called out to the man and said to him,
[time=2638] where are you, do you think God was really fooled?
[time=2643] No, no, he knew exactly where they were, but he's giving him a chance just like he gives you and I a chance, where are you?
[time=2654] He said, I heard the sound of you, look at that, I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself, and he said, who told you that you were naked?
[time=2668] Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?
[time=2672] And I just want you this morning to look with me,
[time=2678] back at verse eight, they heard the what?
[time=2682] Say it out loud, the sound of the Lord.
[time=2686] Look at verse 10, he said, I heard the what?
[time=2689] Say it out loud, I heard the sound of you in the garden.
[time=2695] My friends, I don't know exactly what it looked like.
[time=2699] I'm not sure to what degree he exposed himself physically, but it is clear that to some degree, he had taken on physical form and had walked through a garden and in walking through the garden and brushing up against a plan or walking next to a tree, whatever it looked like, whatever it was, it made what?
[time=2722] It made a sound, he takes on some physical form, he's not a cloud floating in the sky, it's not some light at the west end of the garden, he's with them, God, in some kind of form, in the cool of the day, fellow shipping with them, speaking with them, walking with them, united with them.
[time=2744] I was thinking about how I can, and many of you in the room can as well, I'm sure those of you like men, for instance, who shave, I can shave at my sink in the morning, I can be down, I'm down at this end of the house, the bathroom where I shave and get ready is down here at this end of the house, I can be down here at this end of the house, our house is a ranch, it's just got one big, huge, long hallway.
[time=2769] And from way, way, way, way down here, I don't know, you pick one of the five, it's not the oldest one typically these days, but from the fourth on down, you know, oftentimes something happens and something goes wrong on this end of the house.
[time=2782] I can be shaving down here at this end of the house, and here comes the footsteps.
[time=2788] You with me?
[time=2789] You can just be back there doing your thing, and also down, down, down, down, down, down the hallway.
[time=2794] I can, I can, see, I've been with them so much, we've spent so much time together, we've been so close, I can tell you from my sink, five seconds before the footsteps ever get there, I can tell you what, who it is, 'cause I know the sound of them.
[time=2815] They knew the sound of God walking through the garden.
[time=2822] Wow, in physical form, he's with them.
[time=2832] Often, just God in them, close, intimate, often.
[time=2838] It's the one thing God has always wanted.
[time=2848] It's the one thing that he's always been about.
[time=2852] It's the one thing he has always desired, a close, personal, intimate relationship with the people he created.
[time=2862] Relationship, time together, fellowship, hanging out, say it however you'd like, what God has always wanted most is to be really, really close to you and to me.
[time=2875] Those whose very existence he brought into being,
[time=2883] those he loved before the foundations of the world.
[time=2887] And you know what?
[time=2890] This is so cool, this whole book, this entire book tells the story of his pursuit of that relationship with you and me.
[time=2903] And sometimes, it went really well, and a bunch of times it didn't, so he just kept coming after us.
[time=2910] He just kept pursuing this entire book.
[time=2913] It's the great story of his unfolding,
[time=2919] an ending pursuit of relationship, walking in the cool of the day type relationship, close and intimate.
[time=2929] Now, in the next several weeks, what I want to share with you and what we will as a team continue to share with you, and I don't know how long it's gonna take, but there are some components, now stay with me here, there are some components to this relationship.
[time=2946] I would agree that just to say, he wants relationship with you and I, in a sense that's good enough.
[time=2952] But you know what, when I say relationship to you, or I say relationship to you, I mean, different ones in the room have different pictures of what relationship looks like.
[time=2961] What are the components of a really, really good, healthy relationship?
[time=2965] Well, in the relationship arena with God, he gives us all throughout the scriptures.
[time=2970] He paints a very clear picture of what he designed and desired that relationship to look like.
[time=2977] The components of it, the characteristics of this relationship, so very important for you and I to understand.
[time=2984] We're gonna look at four in the weeks to come.
[time=2987] Let me just read this to you this morning.
[time=2989] I wanna start with this.
[time=2990] First and foremost, if you have your pins out, just write this down, number one, first characteristic, the first component of a God-honoring relationship.
[time=2998] This relationship that he's long to have from the beginning of time, first and foremost, we must understand this God has always desired that the relationship be, write this down, sincere.
[time=3010] Sincere, people, this relationship with God, the fundamental component of it is that from the very beginning, it has always been with God, it has always been about the what?
[time=3023] It has always been about the heart of a man.
[time=3027] He has always longed for the heart of a woman.
[time=3031] It has always been about genuine, authentic, honest relationship, a relationship that begins and finds its home deep in the soul of a person.
[time=3041] God has always fixed his gaze and he has always been preoccupied with the heart of man because it is the heart that he longs to have.
[time=3053] First Samuel, 16, seven, write this down.
[time=3056] Samuel looking for the king that was to be anointed.
[time=3059] God reminds him, and this passage reminds us that while we make it occupied at times, preoccupied with externals, God fixes his gaze on the soul of a man, but the Lord said to Samuel, do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature because I have rejected him.
[time=3077] For God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the clothing, for man looks at the car, for man looks at the house, for man looks at the vacation destinations, for man looks at the talent, you know, man looks at the outward appearance, but not the Lord, because when the Lord really wants to know, when the Lord really wants to assess, when the Lord's really adding it all up, he begins with and has always been consumed with the what?
[time=3111] The heart, the heart.
[time=3114] In Revelation three, the Lord out of great concern
[time=3120] for the church that Laodicea doesn't address necessarily externals, he addresses their hearts, the deeds which flowed out of their hearts, he says, I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot, I wish that you were, either cold or hot.
[time=3139] They had become somewhere between cold and warm, he calls it lukewarm in the next verse, hearts always affect actions, hearts always affect deeds,
[time=3150] he has been from the very beginning and he will be until the end of time consumed with and fixing his gaze on and longing for the hearts of man.
[time=3161] Let me take you back to Genesis four, if I can.
[time=3168] Genesis four, look at this, we oftentimes stop at three, Genesis four begins an amazing story, begins with Cain and Abel.
[time=3179] Look what it says there in chapter four verse one, and now the man had relations with his wife Eve, Adam and Eve have a son, she conceives and gives birth to Cain and she said, I have gotten a man child with the help of the Lord, again, she gave birth to his brother Abel, so now there's Cain and Abel.
[time=3194] Now, some of you don't know this, but look at this, Abel was a keeper of what?
[time=3197] Abel was a keeper of flocks, he had a herd, but Cain was a tiller of the ground, he did produce, vegetation, so it came about, we don't know why, it just says that it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the Lord, of the, now offering to God, very important to God, very important what we bring to God, very important, more than that, how we bring it, we're talking about an offering to God, and here in Genesis four, way back at the beginning, one of the first times we ever see God dealing with this, it says that Cain brought an offering to the Lord of the fruit of the ground, some translations, the literal interpretation would read some of the fruit of what he had, he brought some of.
[time=3242] But look at this, Abel on his part also brought the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions.
[time=3252] Abel from his heart brings the first of his flock,
[time=3258] he brings the best that he had to offer, out of a heart wanting to do what was best and right Abel brings an offering that's pleasing to God, not because of what he brought, but because of the spirit with which he brought it.
[time=3271] He gives sacrificially, Cain brings some of the fruit Abel brings the first of his flock, and look at this, and the Lord had regard for Abel and for his offering, but for Cain and for his offering, he had no regard, God is so consumed, and so committed and so interested in your heart.
[time=3294] In your heart.
[time=3295] Isaiah, let me have you stand quietly, would you?
[time=3304] Let me read this to you.
[time=3306] Isaiah 29, 13.
[time=3309] I hope you'll come back next week, I really do.
[time=3315] These four characteristics of a right relationship with God,
[time=3321] they are amazing, it is great truth, and it should shape the way you and I view and pursue our relationship with him.
[time=3329] It begins my friends with the heart.
[time=3332] And look what it says in Isaiah 29, 13, it says, "Then the Lord said, because this people draw near with their what, and honor me with their what?
[time=3343] But they remove their what?
[time=3348] Hearts far from me.
[time=3350] And their reverence for me consists of tradition learned by rote.
[time=3357] Then the Lord said, because this people, because this people draw near with their words and honor me with their lip service, which is so easy for you and I to do because when we're around it so much, and we've seen it so much, and we've been a part of it for so long, we can get caught in this routine of just saying certain things and just doing certain things and just kind of going with what we've always done.
[time=3385] And in the middle of rote, in the middle of meaningless repetition, we lose the connection that he has longed for from the beginning, the connection that he values, the connection that he longs for, not with our meaningless repetitive activity, but with our what?
[time=3401] Our hearts.
[time=3403] Write this down.
[time=3404] Remember this, Psalm 139.
[time=3407] I'm gonna send you an email this week.
[time=3409] If you're on the email list, if you're not, get on it.
[time=3411] You can just go to our website and get on it.
[time=3414] Every once in a while, I just send out an email with some things on my heart for you as a family.
[time=3420] This week, I'm gonna remind you about Psalm 139, 23, and 24.
[time=3425] Psalm 139, 23, and 24.
[time=3429] And I'm inviting you today.
[time=3431] Every one of you in this room, I'm inviting you if you care about the condition of your heart with him.
[time=3437] There are so many things that can get in the way.
[time=3439] I'm inviting you this week to memorize and to think about and to meditate on and to write some notes on Psalm 139, verses 23 and 24.
[time=3450] Read it, memorize it, pray it, talk to your small group about it.
[time=3456] If you need a small group, call us.
[time=3459] Call, talk to Josh Rang or myself.
[time=3462] We'll help you get connected with people who are on the same journey.
[time=3465] If you need a class on a Sunday morning to go to, let us know, but don't try and do this alone.
[time=3470] Assess and allow God to assist in assessing the condition of your heart.
[time=3476] It's so very important.
[time=3478] Everything else we'll talk about flows from the condition of your heart.
[time=3482] Father God, we pray as we go this morning that you would go with us.
[time=3487] And I pray God that those in the room truly and genuinely and sincerely interested would give themselves God to an assessment this week of their heart with you.
[time=3498] God, as we read Psalm 139, as we commit it to memory, as we look at those verses, verses 23 and 24.
[time=3505] Oh God, I pray that you would respond in a mighty way.
[time=3507] God, be with us, please, as we go.
[time=3510] Help us to realize and value this relationship that you have longed for from the beginning.
[time=3518] And oh God, that we would cooperate with you in it.
[time=3521] Be with us, please God as we go.
[time=3524] Give us hearts for you in your son's name, we pray.
[time=3526] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3550] (upbeat music)
