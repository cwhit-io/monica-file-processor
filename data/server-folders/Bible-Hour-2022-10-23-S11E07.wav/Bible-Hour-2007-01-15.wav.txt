[time=336] Hi, my name is Sam Barfel and I have the distinct privilege and honor of serving Christ by leading the ministry of Blackout Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=351] And I'm excited today to come to you and share with you something that's happening in the life of our school happens every year at this time.
[time=357] At the end of January, beginning of February, we begin our re-enrollment drive and open enrollment drive for next school year, the 2007,
[time=365] 2008 school year.
[time=366] It's hard to believe that it's here already.
[time=368] But Blackout Christian School has been doing its business and engaged in ministry for 34 years now.
[time=374] We're so thankful to the Lord for all that he's allowed us to accomplish in all those years in the lives of literally thousands of students.
[time=380] Today, our enrollment is nearly 800 students in preschool, elementary, junior high, and high school.
[time=387] And I'm proud to say that our students are doing well this year, both academically and spiritually.
[time=393] One of the things I wanted to share with you that's just an exciting new development for us is that we're opening some additional preschool classes in the afternoon.
[time=401] We have a half-day preschool program that we offer in the mornings and some afternoons, and now we're expanding that and offer additional classes in the afternoon as well.
[time=409] Another exciting thing that we're really anxious to tell you about is that for years we have offered a half-day kindergarten program,
[time=416] and next year for the first time in our history, we have opened up a full-day kindergarten option for those families who have that need and that desire.
[time=425] And with that, then we've also expanded our capacity for the amount of students that we can take in kindergarten.
[time=431] And so we're excited about what God's going to do there and who he'll bring to our school to be a part of our preschool and kindergarten as well as all of our grades, grades 1 through 12.
[time=441] So I want to take this moment just to invite you to visit our website to get some more information about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=447] And you can click on BlackhawkChristian.org and get all kind of information about Black Hawk Christian School, even enrollment information and the pricing structure and all the information that's there on our website at BlackhawkChristian.org.

[time=2801] He's the perfect picture of allegiance. His obedience to the will of the Father is flawless. You see the life of Christ was oriented around the Father's work. The verses that we read it refers to accomplish his work. The life of Christ is oriented around the will of God. The verses that we read talk about how he came down to accomplish God's will, not his.
[time=2830] And the life of Christ was oriented around a cup. I know how bitter that cup was. It was the cup of the sins of every generation past, present and future. It was the cup of the separation from the Father. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[time=2859] It was the cup of a brutal and agonizing death on the cross. And his allegiance stayed firm.
[time=2873] This allegiance glorified the Father and at the same time secured our salvation, making it possible for us to swear allegiance to him.
[time=2886] And understand this, while Christ's allegiance is flawless, our allegiance is tainted by our flesh. And our allegiance will and must include confession and repentance, but it's still allegiance.
[time=2904] And in the midst of this pursuit, when we experience those times where we need to confess and repent, in the midst of this pursuit, we must never get off track, but we must focus on the accomplishment of Christ's perfect allegiance for us. His grace is greater than all our sin.
[time=2928] His flawless allegiance. Do you see the beauty in all of this? God wants our allegiance. He desires our allegiance. Our allegiance to him makes much of him and is our greatest good.
[time=2949] This allegiance sent him to the cross to accomplish our redemption. This redemption frees us from the bondage of sin so we can be devoted and loyal to him.
[time=2960] And having been set free from sin, we can now make much of God with great joy.
[time=2967] And when we make much of God, we are most satisfied. Who could come up with that? Only the wisdom of our God.
[time=2981] So please, throw out, throw away, all doubt.
[time=2986] Any worry that you may have, throw out any debate
[time=2992] that might be taking place.
[time=2994] Our God is loving enough.
[time=2999] He is wise enough.
[time=3002] He is good enough.
[time=3005] He is beautiful enough.
[time=3007] He is worthy enough.
[time=3009] It doesn't have to be argued.
[time=3010] There is no one more worthy of your allegiance and mine.
[time=3015] There's none.
[time=3019] You must see this.
[time=3025] He will have the preeminence
[time=3031] and he should have the preeminence for there is no one like our God.
[time=3038] You know this week, as you go throughout your days, I know you will, I will be tempted.
[time=3046] We will have the tendency to distrust God's true intentions for our life.
[time=3052] And we will be tempted to swear our allegiance elsewhere.
[time=3056] It will happen.
[time=3058] I just ask you to do two things this week.
[time=3062] First of all, take some time today.
[time=3068] To share with a loved one where you are most tempted to do this.
[time=3073] Tell someone you trust it.
[time=3078] The parent, the friend, the spouse, just grab them and say, you know what?
[time=3083] This week, I think I'll be most tempted in this way.
[time=3087] Who or what are you most likely to swear allegiance to this week in place of God?
[time=3092] Share that with somebody and have them pray with you.
[time=3097] Secondly, take some time this week.
[time=3101] I've encouraged you to put it on your calendar.
[time=3104] Five minutes, 15 minutes.
[time=3107] Whatever you can carve out and rehearse the kindness of God.
[time=3113] Rehearse the kindness of God.
[time=3117] Maybe you could memorize Psalm 1611 as a family.
[time=3125] Dads should be a great thing to do.
[time=3128] Fathers, husbands with your spouse.
[time=3132] Dads with your kids as a family.
[time=3134] Get around the table and say, you know what?
[time=3135] This week, we're gonna memorize the verse together.
[time=3138] Because I don't want us to forget that God is our good.
[time=3142] Psalm 1611 would be a great verse.
[time=3144] You will make known to me the path of life.
[time=3147] In your presence is fullness of joy.
[time=3151] In your right hand, there are pleasures forever.
[time=3155] Dads, that would be a great thing to do with your family.
[time=3161] Rehearse the kindness of God and then remember the allegiance of Christ.
[time=3170] Just challenge you, even.
[time=3173] Read John chapter 18 through 20 each morning.
[time=3178] Might take you 10 minutes, 10 minutes a morning.
[time=3181] Chapter 18, chapter 19, chapter 20 of John.
[time=3184] Just read it each morning.
[time=3188] Here's what will happen if you do this.
[time=3190] As you do this, as you read these things, you'll be captured.
[time=3194] You'll just be captivated by his beauty
[time=3200] and you'll be compelled again to swear your allegiance to him time and time again.
[time=3208] Your gaze upon Christ will bind you to him.
[time=3212] I'm gonna ask Corbin and Chris to come up in a second.
[time=3220] There's a song that we're gonna sing.
[time=3222] I wanna read it to you.
[time=3225] I'm gonna point out a little bit of the allegiance in it, but it allows us to focus on Christ, to rehearse the kindness of God together right now, to remember Christ, to remember his allegiance.
[time=3241] And here's what it says.
[time=3243] I wanna read it to you and the words, excuse me, the words will be on the screen.
[time=3247] It says this.
[time=3248] I saw one hanging on a tree in agony and blood who fixed his loving eyes on me as near his cross I stood.
[time=3257] And never till my dying breath will I forget that look.
[time=3263] It seemed to charge me with his death, although not a word he spoke.
[time=3268] My conscience felt and owned the guild and plunged me in despair.
[time=3274] I saw my sins his blood had spilt and helped to nail him there, but with a second look, he said, I freely all forgive.
[time=3285] This blood is for your ransom paid.
[time=3288] I died that you might live.
[time=3290] The chorus says this forever etched upon my mind.
[time=3296] Oh, that would be forever etched on our minds.
[time=3299] Forever etched upon my mind is the look of him who died, the lamb I crucified.
[time=3305] And here's the allegiance, get this, this is my prayer.
[time=3307] And now my life will sing the praise of pure atoning grace that looked on me and gladly took my place.
[time=3317] Verse three, "Thus while his death, my sin displays for all the world of you, such is the mystery of grace, it seals my pardon too." With pleasing grief and mournful joy, my spirit now is filled, that I should, should such a life destroy, yet live by him I killed.
