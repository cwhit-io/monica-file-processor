[time=376] Another exciting thing that we're really anxious to tell you about is that for years we have offered a half-day kindergarten program and next year for the first time in our history, we have opened up a full-day kindergarten option for those families who have that need and that desire.
[time=391] And with that, then we've also expanded our capacity for the amount of students that we can take in kindergarten.
[time=397] And so we're excited about what God's going to do there and who He'll bring to our school to be a part of our preschool and kindergarten as well as all of our grades.

[time=435] [MUSIC - 108 seconds]
[time=556] Well, hey, the plan was when you last saw me, Matthew Roars and Tony Opeliger and Brenheimer and myself were to have returned from Uganda yesterday.
[time=565] Most of you got the email that I sent out, others of you may not have, but we never got to go.
[time=571] It was just a day or so before we were scheduled to leave and due to some unrest over there in Uganda within the church there, the Anglican church in Uganda.
[time=583] As most of you remember, our mission was to go and do a pastor's conference. There were some in the Anglican church who were very aware of that. There were a few others who weren't as aware.
[time=593] It was a risk that they were willing to take and turns out that the ones who weren't aware of it found out about it became aware, felt very threatened by the effort and canceled the conference and told the Americans to stay home.
[time=608] And it was terribly disappointing for us, extremely disappointing for our friend who I told you about. His name is Shannon.
[time=616] Shannon and Danielle Hurley have been giving their days and their nights. They have been giving their hearts and their souls to that effort.
[time=625] And it was squashed right in front of them in one fell swoop. Now they believe as do I and as do we that God is in this somehow, some way we believe he's going to in time show Shannon and Danielle and even us what he, what better plans he has in store.
[time=647] But in the meantime, they're really discouraged and I just want to invite you. You were all so willing to pray for us. I would just encourage you to keep praying for Shannon and Danielle, sweet, sweet people who are just thoroughly throwing themselves at this ministry that God's given them.
[time=663] And we'll just wait and see what God does. Our tickets are good for the year and if that gets patched up and there's a chance to go back, we will and we'll keep you abreast of how all that's developing, but please keep them in your prayers.
[time=677] Hey, for the last several weeks, actually from the beginning of the year, that first Sunday in January, we began a discussion. We have been in the midst of a study that took us back to the very, very beginning.
[time=691] And the question that we've asked or the statement that we've made, kind of the theme of our discussion has been this. It's been about the one thing that God has always from the beginning, the one thing that God has always desired to have with his creation, with those that he made, with those that he loves, there has been this one driving
[time=715] there, this one heartbeat in God to in one in one fell swoop have this beautiful thing called a relationship with his people. It's the one thing God's always wanted from the very beginning of time. It's what he designed us to have with him.
[time=732] And I just want to ask you this, what's the one thing, let me come at it this morning, what's the one thing you've always wanted? If I were just to ask you that, what's the, I mean, no hold, you know, no hold's bar, you can just go wherever you want to go with this in your mind, what's the one thing you've always wanted?
[time=752] If I asked you that, and I just did, and you had the freedom to just think about that and just come up with whatever answer you would want to come up with, like the one thing that you've always wanted, that one thing that if you could have that needs would be met, hearts would be fulfilled, satisfaction across the room.
[time=776] I mean, what's the one thing you have always deep down inside wanted? Now, I asked that in many in the room, you could be quickly moving over to this direction in your mind, others, if you could be going over here in this direction, we could go toward material things, we could go toward a change in circumstance.
[time=796] I mean, the one thing you've always wanted. Well, I'm not a psychologist. I'm a bad armchair therapist. I'm not trying to be somebody I'm not here, but I'll tell you that in the years that God's given me to study and to read and to try and better understand this book,
[time=825] with the insights, I believe that it provides. I can today stand here, and I'm not saying this pride, and I'm not saying this with arrogance, but I can answer that question for you.
[time=845] I know what it is that you have always wanted. God's word speaks clearly, and it paints a picture throughout the pages of Scripture of the one thing that you and I have always wanted.
[time=869] And that one thing is to be loved. You have always, down deep inside of you, had this very deep and profound longing to be loved, to be embraced, to be accepted, to be so very special.
[time=894] And you and I have always had that desire because we were designed, we were made in the image of who God, the one who loves, the one who from the very beginning has wanted one thing, and that is to love.
[time=913] And we have from the very beginning wanted one thing, and that is to be loved. And over the course of the last several weeks, we've kind of just done our very best to look through the Scriptures and see how it is this relationship.
[time=927] This one thing he's always desired. We've been looking through the Scriptures, trying to determine how this relationship should look. What would the components be of this relationship with God that he's always been about with people?
[time=939] And as we've done that, initially we talked about how this relationship is to be characterized by sincerity. He has always been after the heart of man.
[time=951] He has always been preoccupied with a genuine relationship with us. We talked about how the relationship was to be characterized by obedience.
[time=961] First there was heart and then there's to be this, by God's design, there's to be this willingness in you and I to follow him, to go where he asks us to go, to do what he asks us to do, to stay away from that, which he asks us to stay away from.
[time=976] Obedience from the heart has always been a pillar, a characteristic of this relationship with him. Allegiance. I'm so thankful that Josh Rang was here last week, and he talked to you about this willingness and this readiness in you and I to pledge our allegiance to him, to be willing to follow him and only him, to be about complete
[time=1000] an absolute submission to him, not the other gods, not the other ways, not the other options, allegiance.
[time=1010] And now this morning we come to what was going to be the fourth, there's actually a four and a five, just more time to think about it, more time to look at it, more time to mull it over in my heart and there's actually going to be this morning of four and five.
[time=1024] Friends, it's a very, very important four and five. It is a very, very significant fourth and fifth characteristic of this relationship that God longs to have and share with us.
[time=1041] And I just can't begin to tell you how important it is. In my heart and mind, as I think this through, in my heart and mind, as I look at you, in my heart and mind, as I think about our family and the future and the opportunities that I believe God has for us, what we embark upon this morning,
[time=1058] is I believe extremely significant for each and every one of you to consider. And let me invite you, if I can here, to open your Bibles to Exodus chapter 19, the fourth and fifth characteristics of this relationship that God has always wanted with you and I.
[time=1078] Exodus chapter 19, I want to read to you verses one through six. What an amazing story. We pick this story of the Exodus up here in chapter 19. What an amazing thing it is that God has done as he has brought his people, the nation of Israel,
[time=1095] out of the bondage and slavery that was theirs in Egypt. He has delivered them and has promised to deliver them in time to the land which he has promised. And would you please in honor of God's word? Would you stand? And let me read this for you. Exodus 19 verses one to six.
[time=1113] In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. When they set out from refedim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness and there Israel camped in front of the mountain Sinai itself.
[time=1134] Verse three says Moses went up to God. What an amazing statement. Think about that. What a position God allowed Moses to stand in there and Moses went up to God.
[time=1157] And the Lord called to him from the mountain saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel." And in verse four this is what God told Moses to say to the people.
[time=1171] Moses was to say you yourselves people have seen what I did, what God did to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles wings and brought you to myself. Now then verse five. If you will indeed obey my voice, there's the obedience.
[time=1189] Now then if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession among all the peoples for all the earth is mine and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[time=1206] These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel. My own possession, a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[time=1223] I want to introduce to you this morning two more characteristics. This relationship with God my friends was to be characterized by distinct living by very, very distinct living and by what we'll see here in a moment by what we're calling divine service.
[time=1246] Father God we stand before you this morning many of us in the room in relationship with you God and so many of us in the room who have a relationship with you God would be the first to admit that our relationship with you needs help.
[time=1265] God we need to better understand you. God we long to better understand what you have designed for us to experience and to pursue with you. God our relationship with you needs to be one that would bring great glory and honor to you a relationship
[time=1283] with God that would make much of you and we realize God that in order to do that we need your help we need your insights we need your direction many of us need to understand in more meaningful and personal ways what it means to really know you and walk with you and God as we look at this passage here this morning.
[time=1302] As we try to better understand what it means to live distinctly and to serve with a divine presence God I pray that you would open our hearts and our minds and our ears to the great life changing truth of your word.
[time=1316] May your spirit and your word do what only they can do in these next moments together in your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1326] You can be seated. Let me give you this fourth characteristic let's look at this can we distinct living God says that this relationship that he has longed to have always with his people and as he talks here from Sinai through Moses to his people he says some very clear and very important things
[time=1347] and I want to just have you look at two things under the heading of distinct living and you see him in five and six now then if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant then you shall be here's the first one my own possession
[time=1361] among all the peoples for all the earth is mine and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests we'll talk about that in a moment and then here's the second thing under distinct living and a holy nation.
[time=1375] My own possession and a holy nation. Let's think about this my friends under the heading of distinct living he has always wanted his own possession and a holy nation he has always wanted the people that he is in relationship with he has always wanted those people to be unique.
[time=1400] He has always from the very beginning wanted them to be different than all the others.
[time=1408] It's always been on his heart it's always been in his design for his people to be for for his peoples as they lived in the midst of all the peoples he wanted his people to be distinct to stand out because of watch this because of who they belonged to
[time=1428] and how they lived because of who they belong to my own possession and how they lived a holy nation.
[time=1437] Let's look at distinct living first of all with respect to who they belonged to this idea that God says you will be my own possession you see it there in verse five my own possession among all the peoples.
[time=1453] Now in the NIV I believe it's translated a treasured possession.
[time=1459] He wants them he wants you and I to be he calls his people to be his treasured possession his own possession.
[time=1468] And what I want you to understand is this that it's not like when he talks about you and I being his possession it's not like he's talking about you and I it's not like he's talking about owning us like he would cattle
[time=1481] or or or property.
[time=1484] No the word treasured there and the NIV gives us great insight into the heart behind this notion of his possession what he's talking about here isn't so much that he would own you like a piece of land he's talking about loving you like he would a child.
[time=1501] His own possession like his own flesh and blood like his own son or daughter.
[time=1508] He says I want you to live and think and value and choose and conduct yourself like your mind a child of God you're in the family of God you're my child you're my treasured precious one.
[time=1523] And in my family in this relationship this treasured precious intimate relationship that we have in the family of God we live like this in the family of God we move like this in the family of God we value this you're my child.
[time=1541] I'm your father this is a treasured possession this relationship that we share live like it.
[time=1551] It's kind of like having an appropriate sense of family pride.
[time=1556] You know we can have that you and I can have an appropriate sense I think of family pride.
[time=1564] It's very connected to who we are as believers it's okay you know that in the Johnson family we do things a certain way it's okay that in the Morris family we would do things a certain way.
[time=1576] You know it's all right for the Dodon family to come at certain things a certain way because that's the way we do it in the Dodon family.
[time=1583] Because the Dodon family or the Johnson family or the Morris family or the Barce family or the Ford family are part of the family of who?
[time=1593] The family of God and we are treasured possession with a father who loves us deeply and calls us to live and think and choose and conduct ourselves as his own possession.
[time=1607] It's a very deep and intimate connection that leads hopefully to very deep and intimate living look at Deuteronomy 4 would you turn and open your Bibles I want to just take you through real quick.
[time=1618] Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers Deuteronomy just before you get to Joshua open your Bibles you can look on with somebody next to you if you don't have one look at Deuteronomy 4 verse 20.
[time=1631] I'm going to just take us through a few passages here where he just again and again and again reiterates this the central powerful concept of you and I in this relationship with him being his own possession.
[time=1646] Deuteronomy 4 20 it reads but the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace from Egypt to be a people for his say it out loud.
[time=1658] Own possession as today look at Deuteronomy 7 go over a couple pages to Deuteronomy 7 verses 5 and 6 if you flip over there to 7 verses 5 verses 5 and 6 it says but thus you shall do to them he's talking about when the nation of Israel would go into the land of whatever country whatever nation it had entered into
[time=1681] and that nation would most assuredly because they were far from God be filled with things that would be against God and so he says as you go in you shall do to them you shall tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars
[time=1696] and hue down their ashram and burn their graven images with fire for why for you are holy people to the Lord your God the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth he's chosen you.
[time=1718] Live like be like think like his own possession go to 14 if you would Deuteronomy 14 verses 1 and 2 it's so fun to just be able to look through the scriptures and see again and again and again great truths reiterated again and again and again for our own benefit and understanding
[time=1743] chapter 14 verse 1 look at that you are the sons there it is the family of God you are the treasured you are the sons of the Lord your God you shall not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead for you are a holy people
[time=1759] and to the Lord your God and the Lord has chosen you to be a people for his say it for his own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth go to 26 Deuteronomy 26 look at verse 16 this is just amazing here.
[time=1777] I came upon this and was just so floored didn't know I would find it but in this passage you will find all of what we've just talked about over the last several weeks it's amazing.
[time=1788] It says this day the Lord your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances there's obedience he commands you to do these things you shall therefore be careful to do them with all of your what?
[time=1803] Heart there's the sincerity there's the genuineness there's the authenticity and with all of your soul you have today declared the Lord to be your God allegiance and that you would walk in his ways and keep his statutes his commandments
[time=1821] and his ordinances and listen to his voice the Lord has today declared you to be his people a treasured possession as he promised you and that you should keep all his commandments and that he will set you high above all nations which he has made for praise fame
[time=1840] and honor and that you shall be a consecrated people it's another word for holy a set apart people to the Lord your God as he has spoken.
[time=1855] God has always been about relationship my friends he has always wanted that relationship to be characterized by distinct living that is born out of who you belong to own possession.
[time=1871] Secondly underneath distinct living secondly look at this with me distinct living characterized by holy behavior holy behavior go back to Exodus 19 five and six now then if you will indeed obey my voice
[time=1890] and keep my covenant then you shall be my own possession among all the peoples for all the earth is mine and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests will get to that and a holy there it is and a holy nation.
[time=1908] You can go back in your notes you know you could just write down all those Deuteronomy passages that we just looked at I don't know if you were catching it as we looked at all of them all of them spoke to the issue of us being his own possession
[time=1922] all of those Deuteronomy passages spoke as well to us being a holy people a holy nation and then look what it says in Leviticus this is just phenomenal Genesis Exodus Leviticus go to Leviticus 20.
[time=1939] It's been a while since you've been to Leviticus 20 hasn't it what an amazing passage and then you come to verse 26 look at this.
[time=1952] Thus you are to be holy. Thus you my people in this relationship that we share you are to be holy to me for I the Lord and what say holy and I have set you apart from the peoples to be who's to be mine.
[time=1974] It's very important here okay don't don't miss this very very important that when a guy like me stands up in a place like this and starts using words like holy.
[time=1986] See a lot of folks have a lot of misconceptions a lot of folks have a lot of different ideas on what that means or what that looks like.
[time=1994] And here in say holy you're sitting here you know listening or you're watching on the broadcast or you're listening online and I want to make sure that we're all at least understanding this phrase holy God has called us to be a holy people.
[time=2008] He called Israel to be a holy nation he longs for you and I to live a holy lives what does it mean to be holy.
[time=2017] It's very simple it's very simple and it's very profound and every one of you in the room needs to understand this the word holy means set apart.
[time=2028] The word holy means set apart the word holy means that that something was here in this setting and it got removed in a sense from that setting and set apart from that for the purpose of godliness.
[time=2046] For the purpose of honoring god for the purpose of making much of him holiness is being set apart for the purpose of honoring and pleasing and making much of god.
[time=2061] It means to be separated it means to be distinct.
[time=2066] Now this is where it gets kind of interesting and this is where I really believe we've made some huge mistakes in the way that we've taught this and the way that we've even lived this out in the way that the church has over the years handled this.
[time=2083] This idea of being separate this idea of being holy I'm going to need some help to do this so just bear with me here I just need like six people.
[time=2094] Hey Bob would you come up Jeff and Sue would you come up it'll be fun really I promise it won't be embarrassing it'll be very painless I promise.
[time=2106] Connolly's would you come up real quick can you do that just real quick there you go awesome thank you hi Robert good to see you yeah it'll be fun seriously Jeff come over here Sue step up a little bit.
[time=2119] There you go Connolly's come over here they go yeah come up like this there you go Bob and the Connolly's stand behind the griggs's there you go Danielle will hide you back there's no no one can see you great.
[time=2129] Okay actually Sue and Jeff switch spots Simon says thank you all right so here's the deal it's very concerning to me and I think it's very important that we understand this.
[time=2140] Here are the peoples all right this is you know this is a group of people this is the nations this is you know this is you and I this is the group of people and what happens is in the midst of this group of people somebody will say Jeff comes to know the Lord.
[time=2156] comes to comes to a point where he fully surrenders his heart and life to Christ realizes his need for his sin to be forgiven completely commits his life to Christ and enters into this relationship that we've been talking about right.
[time=2171] So Jeff becomes a follower of Christ he wants to honor the Lord he wants to honor God and they're in this relationship and he's trying for it to be you know sincere and he wants to be obedient he wants to pledge his allegiance.
[time=2183] And now he gets told that he needs to be distinct he needs to be like God's own possession and he needs to be holy and see then this is where it gets sideways because then somebody comes along and tells Jeff that what holy means is separate.
[time=2200] Holy means to be separated from holy means that now you're a believer now you're a Christian and now you don't do those evil things that those evil sick people over there do.
[time=2217] Not your heads if this is making any sense. Somewhere a while ago it got a little bit skewed and separated turned into rigid distant.
[time=2231] Do you set your cell phone? That's classic. Wait wait wait is it still ringing let me answer it. Is it still? Oh gosh that would have been great.
[time=2245] Can you imagine how it's your people calling.
[time=2252] So I think there are signs that say turn your cell phones off. You're going to work on that obedience thing don't you.
[time=2259] That's alright. So here's what happens we start we start teaching people and we start having this notion that to be separate to be holy to be distinct means to get away from all of those that do all their evil lustful horrible worldly things.
[time=2278] And we come over here and we get holy we get separated from and I think it's the farthest thing from what God intended it.
[time=2290] I think it's the farthest thing I think I think about what Paul said when he said to be in the world but not of the world.
[time=2297] I think the whole context come with me I think the whole context of Exodus 19 was that his people were among the who his people were among the people and his people and he's always been about their what their heart or their actions.
[time=2312] He has always wanted hearts to be separated. He has always wanted hearts to be consecrated. He has always from the beginning wanted people to have hearts that were fully his because when their hearts and their minds and their souls were completely his they could be with the people in a strategic
[time=2335] powerful and amazing way. Not your heads if that makes sense. Holy Holy separate distinct but not over there what what good does that do.
[time=2351] I'll just say this you know what that doesn't do any good. In fact that hurts the cause because when you're over there go ahead stand over there.
[time=2364] Keep going further away you're really really spiritual. When you're over there and you're and you're spiritual and you're right and you're holy and you're separated and you're consecrated to God and you're over there and you don't dare come over here because of all the stuff these guys do.
[time=2384] What are these people thinking about him. Yeah they don't go there yeah I think these people are going to come over there when that guy says from over there hey come over here no.
[time=2398] They're sitting here thinking who in the world does he think he is. Okay come back because we don't want them thinking that what we want is this we want a holy separated heart.
[time=2413] It's completely God's in the midst of the people. Amen. All right give these guys a hand.
[time=2426] I hope that made sense. That's what God's after. That's what God has always been after. Now here's where it gets a little tricky too because some of you sit here like I've sat there in other settings and you hear that and you go oh good.
[time=2440] I don't have to I don't have to I don't have to like get away you know I don't have to get away from my friends I don't have to get away from my associates I don't I can just go and I can just be with them.
[time=2452] And so many times people like you and me take that liberty that license we turn that liberty into license.
[time=2460] We turn that freedom we turn that God desired God designed picture and we absolutely blow it because we do not live distinctively.
[time=2474] And that's for you to think through. That's for you to ask for some help you know if you need it. That's for you to consider.
[time=2483] That's what God's after distinct separate living among them to be his holy people relationship my friends he's always wanted it it's the thing you and I have always wanted.
[time=2495] And he has wanted it from the beginning to be characterized by sincerity obedience allegiance distinct living and now lastly write this down divine service.
[time=2506] That's right divine service he wants your relationship with him to be characterized by divine service what in the world do we mean by that back to Exodus 19 five and six now then if you will indeed obey my voice
[time=2521] and keep my covenant then you shall be my own possession among all the peoples for all the earth is mine and you shall be to me here it is a kingdom of priests.
[time=2537] A kingdom of priests he says you all are to be while living distinctly God long for them to engage in divine service he wanted them to be priests.
[time=2554] Now catch this while it's true that there would be a specific group of men that God would establish through the Levites called priests right.
[time=2563] There was a specific group that would function in some specific ways as priests in the household of God but God is clearly saying here that while that's true I want all of you he says to them on sign.
[time=2577] I want a nation I want a kingdom I want a people who would live priestly.
[time=2587] Priestly God makes it clear that his desire was for all of his people to live and act and be priests now what in the world does that mean.
[time=2599] Well I want you to write this down in its purest sense the word or concept of priest means to mediate the divine write that down it means to mediate the divine literally to transfer or pass God along to others.
[time=2620] It means to mediate the divine literally to transfer or pass God along to others it's literally a divine go between.
[time=2630] If we had more time I'd bring my people back up but we'll just use your imagination I want to just paint this picture for you as simply as I can just imagine the people all right you and me the nations imagine the world imagine folks right here.
[time=2644] And then you just in your mind imagine God over here and I need you to in imagining God you have to understand that what we're imagining here about God is all of God all of God's character all of God's heart all of his justice and all of his compassion all of his kindness
[time=2661] all of his love and mercy everything about God that God longs for the nations to know about him he longs for them to see it in him he has from the very beginning wanted relationship with him and he wants them to understand who he is and what he's like.
[time=2679] And you and I know that God could have just in a moment God could have just boom made that happen but he decides to do this amazing thing.
[time=2690] He puts a he puts a go between in the middle called a priest whose purpose it is by definition is to mediate the divine to literally pass God along and all that's true and right about God.
[time=2713] It's an amazing picture and what a think about it what a privileged vital significant position to be a priest who reflects to a broken and lost world all of God's love and his compassion and his justice and his goodness and his encouragement and his mercy.
[time=2740] And that's what Israel was intended by God to be it's so important that you see this this morning God from the beginning wanted Israel to mediate he wanted Israel to be a nation a kingdom of priests.
[time=2757] That was God's original design he wanted them all of them to pass along him to mediate the divine to a world that desperately needed the divine and to do this would require a very special relationship.
[time=2773] It would require of the Israelites their sincerity and their obedience and their allegiance and their distinct living and their willingness to be engaged in divine service.
[time=2790] And yet the story my friends the story of Israel as you follow it and you saw a lot of this last week with Josh the story of Israel as you turn page after page literally book by book.
[time=2813] The unfolding reality is that the story of Israel was one not a sincerity but of wandering hearts not of obedience but what disobedience not of allegiance but of wanting a new God and new kings and new.
[time=2835] I mean it was anything but allegiance story of Israel my friends is one of wandering hearts and disobedience and a lack of allegiance and distinct living.
[time=2846] No, no, again and again and again Israel postured herself with the nations and instead of living distinctly they began to live like them they began to marry them they began to live with them they began to adopt their cultures and customs they began to worship their false gods.
[time=2864] Again and again Israel would come to the point where in the midst of the peoples you couldn't tell Israel from the people because of the compromise because of the disobedience because of the absence of holy living.
[time=2888] And so following the closing of the Old Testament time frame I mean you get all the weight to the end of the OT and you see it.
[time=2901] I mean it's like you know it's like God just looks at them and realizes it's not going to happen and so the Old Testament comes to a close and some 430 some years of silence and then God speaks.
[time=2918] This is cool this is really really amazing then God speaks and he speaks through a very very special rabbi that enters the scene and his name was what Jesus the son of God comes to fulfill the plan.
[time=2943] So God didn't give up you know God didn't give up God just continues to unfold this plan and this this rabbi shows up on the scene and he begins to talk about the Kingdom of God and he tells a disciple of his whose name was Peter.
[time=2961] He says to Peter Peter on you I will build my what church new plan new people the church.
[time=2978] I'm looking at you because I just I want to make sure you understand how significant what we just said is.
[time=2989] The plan of God today to reach with his love and his truth and his compassion and his justice and his encouragement the plan of God to reach a broken world is you.
[time=3008] Oh wait hold on who's the church what's the church am I and the guys on staff the church 7400 East state the church is this building the church should we should we really say we're going to church.
[time=3023] The church who's the church say it you I'm the church you're the church we are the body of what of Christ and God looks at you don't look at me I'm looking at you God looks at you God says in Ephesians 4 that I am to teach
[time=3046] that the leaders are to teach that the pastors and teachers are to equip the saints for the work of service you are you're a saint first of all we'll talk about that later.
[time=3057] You're a saint and you're the church and God says in his play he still see God still over here wanting to reach the people and now Israel's not in the middle.
[time=3069] He deals with Israel you can read about that in Romans 9 and we can talk about that sometime but now he puts the church in the middle you and I and says guess what I need you to be priests.
[time=3080] Now I know your mind might go different places when I use that phraseology or say it like that but it's the truth people.
[time=3088] He says to you and I it's just an amazing thing go to you know I spend so much time in recent weeks in the Old Testament and it's one of the coolest things about one of the most exciting and encouraging things about what I get to do because I can read all of that in the Old Testament and somebody might be thinking while it was just the nation of Israel.
[time=3108] You know it was just Israel that was supposed to be it was just Israel that was supposed to be the nation of priests God's own possession.
[time=3117] Well you know what that cool thing is you get the first Peter chapter two first Peter a book written by Peter to the church.
[time=3124] First Peter is written not to the house of Israel first Peter is written to believers people who had come to faith in Christ who were now being persecuted by Nero and he writes to them back here in the back part of the Bible.
[time=3137] Now we're not in the front part and back here it says the exact same thing he says in verse nine but you are a chosen race.
[time=3146] See now he's talking to you.
[time=3150] You are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for God's own possession so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light for you once were not a people.
[time=3166] But now you are the people of God.
[time=3169] You had not received mercy but now you have received mercy beloved I urge you verse 11 I urge you he means I beg you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul there's distinct living.
[time=3186] Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles so that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers they may because of your good deeds as they observe them and they do glorify God in the day of visitation.
[time=3206] His new plan his new people with the nations has lost and is hurting as they had ever been God turns now away from Israel for a time to the church to you.
[time=3218] And he says I need you the church to be my own possession I need you to live like a holy nation I need you to serve a lost and broken world like a priest.
[time=3233] I need you you and you and you and you he says you are my plan and you are now in the workplace in your home and your relationships on dates at school wherever you go he says you are the plan you now mediate to a lost and broken world.
[time=3260] Be my priests you know it's interesting I was thinking this week about a priest.
[time=3270] And I thought you know there's a couple of ways you can go on that when I say the word priest most of us in the room have a picture have an image that comes to mind you may have grown up in a church where there was a priest.
[time=3283] And you know when I say the word priest when you think about that with me just for a moment you know there's kind of a negative side of that there's kind of a very interesting side of that here's the negative side of that a priest when you think about him.
[time=3296] See that's that picture there that comes to our mind is part of a religious system whereby that individual still today in the way that they do that he's the one he's the mediator.
[time=3310] He's the one who represents God and only he can because he's the priest see they've missed completely this notion that God says to the church.
[time=3323] All of you be priests so there's a little disconnect there you know here's a here's an interesting side of it though I was thinking about this.
[time=3335] When I see a priest or when you see a priest in the grocery store in an airport when you are I see a priest walking downtown anywhere you and I see a priest is it hard to see the priest.
[time=3355] Or is it easy it's easy to see a priest you're going to be looking at a thousand people then you'll be a priest on the far left side and you go oh there's a priest.
[time=3366] Why I mean go with me on this why because he's distinct he's a priest right now I'm not advocating you all go by collars this week but I am advocating.
[time=3384] That you and I might want to think about distinct living distinct speaking distinct choosing distinct life and relationship you know among all of them and the ability by God's grace and by God's strength to stay true to what is right
[time=3412] and real and God honoring and not to compromise and become so in and of them that when they look at you and they're supposed to look over there and see whoa a priest now we look over there and we just see a bunch of people
[time=3430] because it's just all the same looks the same sounds the same so we need to give that some thought as individuals we need to give that some thought as parents we need to give that some thought as a family and next week I'm inviting you back this will now begin a several week series
[time=3450] a several week teaching on what it means and looks like I hope you'll come back what it means when we hear the phrase the priesthood of all believers we're going to teach on that we're going to come right back to second to first Peter two
[time=3464] and we're going to talk about how you and I in the everyday of life in this effort that God has us in the middle of how we are to function as priests.
[time=3474] Tell your friends it'll be a popular topic in the office come to church in the next week they're going to teach us how to be a priest it'll be fun and it'll be very very insightful I hope would you stand.
[time=3485] Thank you so much for being here today thank you for braving the elements and again please remember we've got elders down front who would love nothing more than to pray with you and spend some time with you Father God we are grateful
[time=3497] for the privilege of being together God I pray that you would help us that in our Bible reading this week in our times together with friends that we could understand better God that you would speak to us and teach us how to live
[time=3513] priestly that we would be distinct that we would engage in divine service that we would mediate well that we would reflect you to others in small and large ways please God give us the privilege of doing that and help us to do it well
[time=3533] in your son's name we pray amen.
