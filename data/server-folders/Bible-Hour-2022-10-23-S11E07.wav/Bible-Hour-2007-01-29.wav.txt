[time=54] Hi, my name is Sam Barfell and I have the distinct privilege and honor of serving Christ by leading the ministry of Blackout Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=62] And I'm excited today to come to you and share with you something that's happening in the life of our school happens every year at this time.
[time=68] The end of January, beginning of February, we begin our re-enrollment drive and open enrollment drive for next school year, the 2007-2008 school year.
[time=78] It's hard to believe that it's here already.
[time=80] But Blackout Christian School has been doing its business and engaged in ministry for 34 years now.
[time=86] We're so thankful to the Lord for all that He's allowed us to accomplish in all those years in the lives of literally thousands of students.
[time=92] Today, our enrollment is nearly 800 students in preschool, elementary, junior high and high school.
[time=99] And I'm proud to say that our students are doing well this year, both academically and spiritually.
[time=105] One of the things I wanted to share with you that's just an exciting new development for us is that we're opening some additional preschool classes in the afternoon.
[time=113] We have a half-day preschool program that we offer in the mornings and some afternoons and now we're expanding that and offer additional classes in the afternoon as well.
[time=121] Another exciting thing that we're really anxious to tell you about is that for years we have offered a half-day kindergarten program, and next year for the first time in our history, we have opened up a full-day kindergarten option for those families who have that need and that desire.
[time=137] And with that, then we've also expanded our capacity for the amount of students that we can take in kindergarten.
[time=142] And so we're excited about what God's going to do there and who He'll bring to our school to be a part of our preschool and kindergarten as well as all of our grades, grades 1 through 12.
[time=152] So I want to take this moment just to invite you to visit our website to get some more information about Black Hawk Christian School and you can click on BlackhawkChristian.org and get all kind of information about Black Hawk Christian School, even enrollment information and the pricing structure and all the information that's there on our website at BlackhawkChristian.org.
[time=172] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in Heaven and on Earth."
[time=197] Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=205] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=223] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=253] Redeemer love has been my feet and shall be till I die.
[time=268] And shall be till I die and shall be till I die.
[time=282] Redeemer love has been my feet and shall be till I die.
[time=298] Good morning. My name is Jim Pearson. I'm the senior pastor at Brookside Church.
[time=303] You're probably wondering what I'm doing here this morning on the Bible Hour.
[time=307] Well it's because my good friend Kelly Bird has allowed me this opportunity to speak with you about a special seminar coming up at Brookside on Saturday morning February the 17th.
[time=318] Let's begin by just seeing a little bit of what it's going to be about.
[time=328] I guess the eternal purpose would be to make sure things get done.
[time=333] I don't know to ensure that businesses and I don't know if there is an eternal purpose to my work.
[time=340] I don't understand the question I guess.
[time=343] The eternal purpose of my work. That's a good question.
[time=350] I guess I've never given that any thought.
[time=354] Hi, I'm Ray Hilbert, president and co-founder of Truth at Work. Our mission is to change the way America works by bringing the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the marketplace.
[time=365] As I've traveled the country over the last ten years, I've seen first hand that many men and women are desperately seeking to find meaning and purpose to their work.
[time=375] Many, if not most of them, have become bored with their daily routines.
[time=379] And they feel as though that what they do for a living doesn't really seem to have significance or eternal purpose.
[time=385] That their work and careers are not really making a difference in the world.
[time=389] You know, that's why we've developed the purpose to your work seminar.
[time=393] Hey, let's face it. The marketplace is tough. Corporate scandals, layoffs, stiff competition, information moving at breakneck speeds.
[time=402] Everywhere you turn, people are stressed.
[time=405] So now's the perfect time for Christians to make a difference in the marketplace.
[time=410] What if you found just the right career to fulfill God's call in your life?
[time=414] A great match of your gifts, talents and passions.
[time=418] How would it feel to wake up each and every day and know that you were serving the Lord through your work?
[time=423] The purpose to your work seminar is designed to help you do just that.
[time=427] This unique, energetic and highly interactive workshop will help lead you toward experiencing intimacy with God in the midst of the daily grind.
[time=436] Your work and how you do it is very important to God, no matter what you do for a living.
[time=441] During this seminar will help you develop a game plan for ministry in the context of your job.
[time=447] And you're going to complete many practical tools and exercises that will help you move back into the marketplace with more focus, more hope, more purpose.
[time=456] And a whole lot less stress.
[time=458] We really believe that you're going to come away from our time together encouraged and with a clear understanding of the biblical view that God has designed for you in the marketplace.
[time=467] That you have been created to serve him every hour, every day in the context of your job.
[time=474] We look forward to helping you develop purpose to your work.
[time=477] So get registered today.
[time=479] You'll be glad you did and we look forward to seeing you there.
[time=482] Well, I don't know about you, but I want to be at Brookside Church on Saturday morning, the 17th of February for the purpose to your work seminar.
[time=491] It's going to be great.
[time=493] And you know what?
[time=494] The cost is only $25.
[time=496] That includes your manual for the conference.
[time=499] It includes everything.
[time=500] There will be snacks available, $25.
[time=503] And if you'd like to reserve a spot for the seminar at Brookside Church, call this number.
[time=509] Just call Brookside 4859665.
[time=512] Tell the person who answers the phone.
[time=514] You want to reserve a spot for the purpose to your work seminar and we'll be looking for you on that Saturday morning.
[time=520] It is great to be with all you.
[time=523] Thanks for, I think this is three weeks in a row.
[time=526] We've said thanks for braving the cold.
[time=528] A little bit colder today.
[time=530] We should have had people actually who came here uninvited in this cold.
[time=536] They should have taken money out of that plate as it went by.
[time=540] We're suggesting we should have paid them for coming to church.
[time=545] I'll get back to you on that one.
[time=548] It is good to be together.
[time=550] It's good to see all of you.
[time=551] Thank you for being here.
[time=552] And I'm joined today by our teaching team.
[time=555] This is our teaching team here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=558] This is Steve Longbrake.
[time=560] Over on the end, you may know many, some of you may know Steve.
[time=563] Those of you may not, we get to share him with a number of different ministries.
[time=567] And he is here sometimes.
[time=569] He is abroad.
[time=570] Other times, God's using him in some amazing ways here and across the world.
[time=575] But when he's here, we love it when we get to spend this kind of time together.
[time=578] Steve's been a part of the Blackhawk family for a total of 28 years.
[time=582] 28 years going on 30 years.
[time=584] He is our resident wise old sage.
[time=588] And we are thankful for his wisdom.
[time=590] There are a lot of people, they are older than me.
[time=593] There are a lot of guys out there older.
[time=594] I'm young.
[time=595] I know.
[time=596] But we're thankful.
[time=597] Thankful for you.
[time=598] And this is Dr. Mitchell Cruz.
[time=599] And Mitchell's been around here for about six years.
[time=601] Is that right?
[time=602] That's that year and a half of you and I hung out together.
[time=604] That's right.
[time=605] Yeah.
[time=606] Mitchell and I met at a conference.
[time=609] Mitchell from Auburn.
[time=611] Me from Fort Wayne.
[time=612] Me here at Blackhawk.
[time=613] And Mitchell going through a transitionary period in his life and was trying to figure out what was going to be next for him.
[time=619] His business and was with his brother and some other guys from a church in Auburn in a pastor's conference in Chicago.
[time=625] 5,000 men and women in a room.
[time=628] And I was late getting in.
[time=630] I know that shocks you.
[time=632] I was late getting in.
[time=634] I was apart from our team and I'm looking for a seat in a seat of 5,000 people and I find one seat.
[time=640] And I sit down in this one seat.
[time=642] And nobody else would sit beside him.
[time=651] And I looked at him and he looked at me and he said I know you.
[time=656] And we just struck up a conversation and kind of got to know each other and then ended up sitting next to each other the next day.
[time=664] And began a dialogue and we began to meet.
[time=668] He asked me if I would and I said yes and we met for over a year on Mondays.
[time=673] I think it was Thursday's.
[time=675] Now we mean on Thursdays now.
[time=677] Oh, we did.
[time=678] It was Mondays.
[time=679] I'll go back to the calendar and prove it to you.
[time=681] It's whatever you say it is.
[time=682] Not that I have to be right.
[time=683] No, I think it was Mondays.
[time=685] But anyway, it was Mitchell's been here.
[time=687] Where were we?
[time=688] It was Tuesday afternoon.
[time=689] Steve Mitchell and myself.
[time=692] And we about five years ago, we decided to go to a teaching team approach and in kind of a conservative way.
[time=700] Meaning like if I wasn't going to be here, there'd be another teaching pastor and that's great.
[time=705] And then we thought we were in a room one day and we thought, you know what?
[time=709] Why don't we just all teach together?
[time=712] And we did that a few times and like it or not.
[time=715] And you may not.
[time=716] It's okay.
[time=717] You may be sitting there right now going, man, I wish that game were on at one.
[time=721] But we really, really, we really enjoy getting to do this together.
[time=729] And there's a lot of reasons why I grew up spiritually kind of in a mindset where there was just one voice.
[time=738] And you know, there may be some upsides to one voice, but I have found great upsides in multiple voices as I've grown.
[time=748] I'm realizing there's great wisdom to be gleaned.
[time=751] There's great encouragement to be had.
[time=753] There's great perspective to be offered.
[time=755] You'll get perspective from Steve that you would never get from me because I'm not Steve.
[time=761] And there's insights that Mitchell brings that Steve and I look at each other and go like, where did that come from?
[time=767] But Mitch has a way of bringing that out and it's insightful and encouraging.
[time=772] And so Mitchell has a feminine side that we don't have.
[time=775] Oh my goodness, man, am I taking the views?
[time=779] I can't believe it.
[time=780] You know why their laughing is hard?
[time=781] They all know that.
[time=782] They know, yes.
[time=783] They got four daughters.
[time=784] They hold my diet peps in my cookie like this.
[time=786] That's all right.
[time=787] But together, it's a decent thing.
[time=789] We're going to have to edit the whole feminine thing out.
[time=792] That's all right.
[time=793] But we were talking earlier about why this is so encouraging, you know, at least for us.
[time=799] And again, many of you, I think, you know, many of you over the years have talked about just how you enjoy it.
[time=804] But we were talking about why we enjoy getting to teach together.
[time=807] And Steve said it, I think, really well.
[time=809] And I think it's true.
[time=810] Tell them what you said.
[time=811] I just said, on the way here this morning, I was actually thinking about it and asking the Lord to not let us get in the way of what He wants to do because I know we could do that.
[time=818] I just said, I know, I enjoy it because we really love each other.
[time=824] We really do.
[time=825] And we can't step on each other because we're going to defer.
[time=828] So there's no territory up here.
[time=830] We really do love each other.
[time=832] Yeah, that's true.
[time=834] [AMEN] And I want to say one more thing.
[time=836] I want to ask them to have Steve say it.
[time=838] And this is just a freebie.
[time=840] It's part of the message.
[time=841] But boy, it was sure profound.
[time=843] And so it was really an indictment in a way.
[time=847] He didn't mean it as an indictment.
[time=849] But boy, I'm so grateful that he said it the way he said it.
[time=852] We sang a song this morning.
[time=854] And in that song, I think we're actually sang it a couple of times.
[time=858] But towards the end there, Ed sang the refrain.
[time=862] And there's this one line that Ed sang again and again.
[time=865] He talked about how there's a fountain filled with blood.
[time=869] And drawn from Immanuel's veins and sinners plunged beneath that flood.
[time=877] Lose all their guilty stains.
[time=885] Now, I try never to speak for you.
[time=888] And I won't on this one.
[time=890] But I'll just tell you that there are times when in my own heart I have a hard time with that thought.
[time=899] And the hard time that I have with that thought goes something like this.
[time=903] How could, I want to sit back and I want to kind of pull God aside.
[time=907] And I don't mean to sound irreverent, but I want to kind of pull God aside and say what are you thinking?
[time=912] How, you ever feel this way?
[time=915] How could you do that?
[time=917] You're getting hosed.
[time=920] How could you forgive?
[time=922] I mean, forgive some of my guilty stains, but I'm me and I've done what I've done.
[time=926] How could you forgive?
[time=928] You ever feel that way?
[time=929] How could you forgive all?
[time=930] And I'm thankful that he has.
[time=932] And I know, and I believe that he has, but do you ever just wonder how in the world could he free?
[time=936] And then, and that's just mine.
[time=938] I'm not talking about yours.
[time=941] I think how in the world could he forgive all my guilty stains?
[time=945] And I lean over to Steve, first hour and I asked both he and Mitch, I said how, why is that sometimes so hard for me to grapple with?
[time=956] And this was really, really, this was, it was encouraging, but it was a little hard to hear, but it's so very true.
[time=962] Tell them what you said.
[time=964] It's because I can't forgive like that.
[time=972] I just can't forgive like that.
[time=974] And so it's really hard for me to receive him forgiving me like that.
[time=982] Do you hear that?
[time=985] Pure forgiveness is so foreign to you and me that when it's offered we have a hard time really putting our arms around it, really accepting it.
[time=1001] And it's just an encouragement to you and to me to keep giving ourselves to what it would mean and what it would look like to purely and completely forgive.
[time=1011] Very in lies and understanding and a celebration, I think, of God's great love and his forgiveness.
[time=1018] [AMEN - 1 seconds] Well, hey, we're going to kind of transition this morning last week.
[time=1025] I talked about the fact that one of the things that's so sweet about our relationship with God is this idea of him wanting us to be priests.
[time=1034] And I talked about the nation of Israel and how all that works.
[time=1038] I'm going to kind of review real quick where we were last week, add a little bit to that, and then Mitchell's going to tell us where we're going.
[time=1045] So Steve, review this series, one thing God has always wanted, relationship.
[time=1050] Last week, Kelly, one of the things he was doing was helping us understand how distinct that is.
[time=1057] And he did this illustration, he had five people come up, remember?
[time=1060] I'm not going to have five come, but if you guys would come over here, Kelly will be four because he is about that size.
[time=1067] Actually, did you see the baby born in Mexico this week on headline news?
[time=1072] Please.
[time=1073] Fourteen eight.
[time=1076] And he was twelve eight, I've always marveled at that.
[time=1080] That baby was Caesarean, by the way.
[time=1082] Kelly's mother had him.
[time=1084] I just didn't have any more kids.
[time=1088] She almost died.
[time=1089] I know.
[time=1090] It just about told her story.
[time=1091] Yeah.
[time=1092] Oh, man.
[time=1093] Anyhow, so he can count us four.
[time=1095] That'll work fine.
[time=1097] And Mitchell's going to be one, but he's going to be one nation right now, the nation of Israel.
[time=1102] Remember last week, Kelly didn't have time to develop this.
[time=1105] He studied a lot about the Old Testament and the original covenant and how those things play out.
[time=1110] He really didn't have time to develop it as much.
[time=1112] I'm going to add one little thing to it.
[time=1114] And that is that when God chose his people, these are the peoples around God's chosen people.
[time=1122] When God chose his people, he said, in Leviticus 11, 19, 20, he said, eat this, be different.
[time=1132] Don't eat this, be different.
[time=1138] And I will shine down my blessing on you as a different people, a holy people, a people that are mine.
[time=1148] I'll shine down on you and the nations around you, now don't intermarry.
[time=1153] I'm calling you out to be different.
[time=1156] These nations around you will see my blessing on you and they'll want that.
[time=1162] That's what God said.
[time=1164] Now, we get confused and like Kelly said last week, remember, sometimes churches get all weird and they start saying,
[time=1172] oh, distinct, separate, separated, obedient, clean, stay away from all that stuff.
[time=1179] And they leave the people.
[time=1182] And there's a huge difference.
[time=1184] The difference today is the Holy Spirit of God's dwelling in the believer.
[time=1189] And we are empowered to be in it.
[time=1193] Get back over there.
[time=1194] It's kind of like the colts fan in between the two bears fan.
[time=1197] Look at that.
[time=1198] God has empowered us by His Spirit to be in the world and not of it.
[time=1206] And He doesn't just shine down on a nation anymore.
[time=1210] He radiates out of because He's in you.
[time=1213] It's Christ in you radiating His light to them.
[time=1217] That's attractive, really different.
[time=1220] Not a different covenant, a fulfillment of the covenant.
[time=1223] And that's the priestly thing that we talked about, the priestly privilege of being somebody who gets to mediate, to take God and pass God along because of Christ in them.
[time=1237] So a priest is a connector.
[time=1241] A priest connects with God in order to connect God with others.
[time=1247] So the question today that we want to answer is how do you do that, how do you connect God with others?
[time=1254] How do you connect God with others?
[time=1256] How many people have a cellular phone?
[time=1258] Raise your hand.
[time=1259] Okay.
[time=1260] How many people have three-way calling?
[time=1263] Three-way calling.
[time=1264] All right.
[time=1265] This is good.
[time=1266] It's amazing.
[time=1267] I just learned about three-way calling, first hour.
[time=1272] Who left?
[time=1273] He's hoping for 10-way.
[time=1274] Did you laugh hard over there?
[time=1279] It's a great idea.
[time=1280] So how do we connect others with God?
[time=1283] It's a three-way call.
[time=1286] On a three-way call, I, that number, I call somebody.
[time=1291] And there's a connection made.
[time=1294] I then call somebody else.
[time=1298] And there's that second connection made.
[time=1300] And when that second connection is made, that person is connected now.
[time=1305] There's a third connection with that first person.
[time=1308] How do we connect God with others?
[time=1312] It's a three-way call.
[time=1314] Every encounter is a three-way call.
[time=1319] And you might say, "Well, I dial the number, but how's all that happen?" Well, it happens because of this invisible cellular network.
[time=1327] And Christ is that invisible cellular network.
[time=1333] Christ connects me to God.
[time=1337] Christ connects me with others.
[time=1340] And Christ in me connects others to God.
[time=1345] That's the message.
[time=1346] So we're going to look at a passage that says that.
[time=1349] It's going back where Kelly was last week.
[time=1351] And it's 1 Peter 2, 9 through 12.
[time=1354] So in honor of God's word, if you could stand.
[time=1363] But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[time=1374] so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[time=1382] For you once were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[time=1389] You had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[time=1394] Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fresh fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
[time=1401] Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles so that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers, they may be because of your good deeds as they observe them glorify God in the day of visitation.
[time=1415] Let's pray.
[time=1417] And God may it be so.
[time=1421] May we have a connection with you that changes our lives.
[time=1427] That changes our connection with others and their connection with you.
[time=1431] And God may not be by any man's might and not by any man's power, but only by your Holy Spirit of Christ.
[time=1443] And we pray these things in Jesus' name.
[time=1446] [AMEN] So three things in the passage.
[time=1452] And it's a three-way call.
[time=1454] Every encounter is a three-way call.
[time=1456] Christ connects us with God.
[time=1460] Christ in us connects others with God.
[time=1464] So let's look at that.
[time=1465] First part of verse nine, verse Peter 2-9, Christ connects us with God.
[time=1471] Peter uses a list of characteristics of traits and descriptors that he pulls from the Old Testament and gives them to those who are in Christ.
[time=1484] And he says, you're a chosen race, you're a royal priesthood, you're a holy nation, you're a people for God's own possession.
[time=1494] And we're just going to look at those quickly.
[time=1496] And the first one is a chosen race.
[time=1498] The NIV says a chosen people.
[time=1501] The word chosen is important because 2,000 years ago in Rome, it was a potpourri of religions.
[time=1509] And every religion in essence is man-made.
[time=1512] But Judaism was accepted as one of those.
[time=1514] So as long as Christianity was connected to Judaism in Christ, which it is, then it could, it was allowed initially to go.
[time=1523] Christ followers could worship Christ freely, initially.
[time=1527] But that was changing in first Peter throughout Rome.
[time=1531] It's very important to the readers and to the hearers of this letter that would have been read aloud in worship in its entirety that this is an idea.
[time=1542] This concept is chosen by God, not by man.
[time=1547] That God would choose a people by mercy in Christ.
[time=1552] And so we are that chosen people. We are that chosen race. God makes the choice.
[time=1560] The passage goes on to say in describing who we are in this relationship with Christ, Christ connecting us with God, chosen race.
[time=1569] Secondly, look at what it says, a royal priesthood.
[time=1572] You see that? A royal priesthood.
[time=1574] A royal priesthood would, you know, in the biblical history of this, as you look at this concept, a royal priesthood is a very unique priesthood in that those in this priesthood belong to and serve the king.
[time=1590] And not just anybody gets into this royal priesthood.
[time=1594] The royal priesthood is one whereby you're a part of this royal priesthood by birth.
[time=1601] But if you're in the line, you inherit this privileged position of being a part of this royal priesthood.
[time=1610] And he says to us, he says to the church, you now are in this royal line. You are royal priests.
[time=1619] It was a very, note this, it was a very privileged position.
[time=1624] It was a significant spot to be in this royal priesthood.
[time=1630] Israel back to Exodus 19 had once been in this spot.
[time=1636] Now we come to a season of time here.
[time=1638] Now we come to a window of history where they've forfeited that privilege.
[time=1643] Now God looks to the church.
[time=1645] Now Peter, as he writes, inspired by the Holy Spirit reminds you and I, we have been brought into this royal line as royal priests, a chosen race, royal priests and a holy nation.
[time=1659] He says, in Romans 11, remember it says that this wild olive chute of a Gentile, all of us, are grafted into his chosen vine.
[time=1672] We're grafted in, and now the king and the priest dwells in us.
[time=1679] He does.
[time=1680] That's good.
[time=1681] The king and the priest dwells in us.
[time=1685] That's the only reason we are priests.
[time=1688] [AMEN] We're a holy nation.
[time=1691] A people set apart.
[time=1692] That's what holy means.
[time=1693] Holy is a great word.
[time=1695] We really have the wrong connotation about it when we just think about it in our natural condition.
[time=1701] The reality is, holy means totally other than other.
[time=1707] It means completely different.
[time=1711] And like I showed you with that demonstration, the nation of Israel, he made them completely different from everybody else on the planet by what they put in and what they didn't put in in food and what they drank and what they did and what they didn't do.
[time=1729] He set them apart.
[time=1730] He made rule.
[time=1731] And I don't believe it's not because God doesn't eat the kite.
[time=1736] Matter of fact, I don't even know if God eats.
[time=1738] But he probably does.
[time=1739] We're going to have a marriage supper or the lamb.
[time=1741] But the father, it's not that he doesn't eat the kite necessarily.
[time=1744] He said, I'm going to set you apart from everybody else.
[time=1746] You won't eat the kite.
[time=1748] And you won't eat the animals that have these feet and don't eat the kite.
[time=1753] So he set them apart.
[time=1755] And he has set us apart as well for obedience.
[time=1759] We are to be obedient and be set apart and distinctive in Christ.
[time=1767] We're to be obedient not because it's some conditional response that we're looking for.
[time=1774] He gave a conditional response to a conditional behavior to the nation of Israel when he had them set apart.
[time=1781] If you do these things the way I tell you, and this will be your blessing and I'll reveal myself to everybody else as I bless you.
[time=1788] Now he says, Steve, I have blessed you.
[time=1793] You are mine in Christ.
[time=1795] Now set yourself apart to express your Thanksgiving.
[time=1800] A little different.
[time=1802] We're part of a holy nation.
[time=1804] A set apart nation.
[time=1806] A set apart for godliness.
[time=1808] On his part is his moral virtue.
[time=1811] We're set apart.
[time=1813] Heavenly citizenship.
[time=1816] So we can obey.
[time=1818] So we can't privilege of obeying.
[time=1820] A chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and then finally a people for God's own possession.
[time=1827] A people for God's own possession.
[time=1830] The NIV says of people belonging to God.
[time=1833] The language and the implication is redeemed.
[time=1837] Redeemed.
[time=1838] Redeemed people for God's own possession.
[time=1841] And when something is redeemed at least three things have taken place.
[time=1845] First, if you want to write it down, one was enslaved to a debt.
[time=1851] One was enslaved to a debt.
[time=1855] Second, the debt was paid.
[time=1860] The debt was paid.
[time=1863] Third, the one enslaved to the debt is set free.
[time=1871] A people for God's own possession redeemed by Christ.
[time=1877] We were enslaved in our debt of sin.
[time=1881] Christ paid the debt.
[time=1884] And Christ has set us free as for freedom that he has set us free.
[time=1889] And so what the whole point of these characteristics of these traits, the whole point of that is that Peter and other New Testament writers called Gentile Christians by the titles that God gave Israel in the desert, meaning there is one covenant, not two.
[time=1905] One for Jews and one for Gentiles.
[time=1906] There is one, and that covenant is in Christ.
[time=1909] This is a combination, verse nine, is a combination of Exodus 19, 5, and 6, which Kelly talked about.
[time=1915] And Isaiah 43 verses 20 through 21.
[time=1919] Exodus 19, 5, and 6 with the people in the desert, enslaved, and now being free.
[time=1923] And Isaiah 43 prophesying Christ.
[time=1928] We are a royal priesthood, 1 Peter 2, 5, if you want to go forward, 5 verses, or backward,
[time=1934] 5 verses, however you would want to say it, verse 2, 5.
[time=1939] It says, "You also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God." Through Jesus Christ, those who have fully surrendered their lives to Christ as Savior and Lord
[time=1955] are in Christ, and now Christ is in them.
[time=1957] And that is what makes you a chosen race.
[time=1960] Christ is who makes you a royal priesthood.
[time=1962] Christ is who makes you a holy nation.
[time=1964] Christ is who makes you a people who are redeemed for God's own possession.
[time=1968] And listen to this, a chosen race.
[time=1970] Well, it's Christ, Luke 9, 35 says, is the chosen one.
[time=1973] You are a royal priesthood, royal king.
[time=1976] It is Revelation 19, 16 that says, Jesus Christ is the king of kings, a priesthood, a connector.
[time=1982] It is Hebrews 31 that says, Jesus is the high priest, a holy nation.
[time=1988] John 6, 69 says that Jesus Christ is the holy one.
[time=1992] A people for God's own possession, redeemed, prophesying of Christ.
[time=1996] Isaiah 59, 20 says, Jesus Christ is the redeemer.
[time=2001] My invisible connection, that first connection to God is in Christ.
[time=2006] The person of God, Christ alone.
[time=2009] [AMEN] And that leads us to a question.
[time=2015] Yeah, and it's a very, very, it's a very important question.
[time=2019] In fact, it would be the question that everybody in the room this morning would want to ask.
[time=2025] And I know many of you.
[time=2027] I don't know all of you, but I know many of you.
[time=2029] And I understand that many of you would answer this question.
[time=2033] Yes.
[time=2034] But just having heard all of that, having understood, and I hope that was clear, I believe it was,
[time=2043] having seen from the Scriptures and having heard what's taken place and what we who are in Christ
[time=2051] have the privilege of experiencing and having.
[time=2055] Then we've got to ask the question, are you in Christ?
[time=2063] Not do you know about God?
[time=2066] Not do you come here 75% of the time in a given year?
[time=2072] Not were you born and raised in Indiana?
[time=2075] Not, you know, Chevrolet, Apple Pie, not religion, not, but are you, have you, whoever you are,
[time=2086] wherever you've been, have you fully surrendered your heart and life to Jesus Christ?
[time=2092] Have you stepped over that line as God draws you over that line and completely given yourself to him?
[time=2101] When you do, when we fully surrender our hearts and lives to him, we become a chosen people,
[time=2107] a royal priesthood, a holy nation.
[time=2110] You have access to and you get the privilege of participation in that for his glory to make much of him.
[time=2117] And we just can't go on any further this morning without at least just asking that, to give you who haven't made that commitment.
[time=2125] Those of you who haven't made that decision, we want to give you the opportunity to be thinking, to be open in your heart to what God may be doing in you as we think this through.
[time=2136] Christ connects us with God and what an amazing connection it is.
[time=2143] Christ connects us three-way call again.
[time=2147] Christ connects us with others to proclaim the excellencies of God.
[time=2152] Talk about that, Steve.
[time=2154] Man, I was just sitting here listening to that thinking, I just don't need a super bowl.
[time=2160] That's the biggest thing going on my day today, I'll tell you that right now.
[time=2166] [AMEN] And the privilege that we have to be the instrument that God uses, Christ in us connecting to other people.
[time=2176] He actually does the connecting and to the extent that we are a holy people and we are living in obedience, he fills us up.
[time=2187] And he then uses us as the tool to proclaim, announce, we get to be the proclamation of God.
[time=2198] For claiming not what he's done for me, his excellencies.
[time=2205] Look at that, I love the NASB here, I love that so much.
[time=2210] It says, in the middle of verse 9, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[time=2222] You know, some people can't remember the kind of darkness that other people do.
[time=2227] Some of you are in the kind of darkness that we're talking about.
[time=2231] And I can remember it.
[time=2233] And the only thing physically I can remember that helps me realize the darkness that is going on spiritually, as I was in the cave in Ohio.
[time=2242] We went down this cave way down deep and we got down there, they said, "Okay, now, don't move, but we're going to turn the lights out."
[time=2250] So when they did, I was working my best to see my fingers in front of my, and I realized it wouldn't take very long in that darkness for people to panic and to try to get out.
[time=2262] And I know this, if people are in that physical setting, they're not really concerned about the other people in the room, they're trying to find the light themselves.
[time=2272] And I was, you know what? He has drawn us out. He's called us out. He brought us out of that darkness into his marvelous light.
[time=2281] And we get the privilege of being the tool that he uses to proclaim his excellencies, not necessarily with our voice, but some of us do it that way.
[time=2291] It is by the means, whatever gift he's given you, he will shine through it. If you have the gift of helps, he will shine through your help.
[time=2306] It says, "I get to be the walking advertisement." Did you ever see that movie, "The Walking Dead," or "The Walking Dead Man," that's what it was? I never saw it, but I got the concept because I was intrigued.
[time=2321] Thank you. "Dead Man Walking," like I said, I've never seen it. "The Walking Dead Man" is good. This is spontaneous. We didn't talk about this, though.
[time=2330] It's all right. The old sage. The dead, dead man walking. When they're on death row, they call the guy on death row, "It's a dead man walking."
[time=2340] He's sentenced. He's sentenced. That's not funny. I'm still laughing. But we're alive. Anybody that doesn't know Christ is a dead man walking, but we get to be the walking advertisement of the excellencies of the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[time=2364] How are you? Isn't that right? Absolutely. So then it says, verse 10, "For you were once were not my people." I wasn't. "But now you are the people of God." He says, "You had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy."
[time=2386] "If I realize the mercy, I expose the hope." And 1 Peter 3 says, "They'll ask me, and I need to be ready to give an answer. If I'm a walking advertisement filled with hope, because I know the mercy that God has bestowed upon me by grace through the blood of Christ and saved me so that I'm an alive man walking."
[time=2415] They'll ask me about it in some way. They won't always say, "Why do you have hope?" But they'll ask.
[time=2421] And you got to be ready to give an answer, because we get to be the instrument that he uses. Oh my goodness.
[time=2427] Well, that's him connecting me to others. And now, thirdly, do you want to say something? Yeah, we've got to ask another question.
[time=2434] Oh, go ahead. Did you all understand that? I'd like to do it over again if you didn't. No. You all got that. Okay. It was clear. It was very well said.
[time=2449] So then, we've got to ask, as it relates to our families, as it relates to our marriages, as it relates to caring for the diseased, the refugee and the poor,
[time=2471] as it relates to your time and mine away from this place. How's the ad? How's the advertisement? How are we doing?
[time=2491] What are we proclaiming? What are we radiating? Advertisements, the proclamation, it sends a message, right?
[time=2501] To an on-looking world, far from God in need of hope, and they're living around you and I, the church, who get to proclaim,
[time=2512] who get to be living advertisements of what it looks like, it means to live with purpose and hope and forgiveness in Christ.
[time=2523] So how's the ad? What are they picking up? What are they seeing? What are they hearing? From you and from me.
[time=2534] It's an important question. There's probably some discussion we could have about that. Probably some ways we could measure that if you wanted to.
[time=2543] We could talk about that, but I'll tell you, it doesn't take me long to think that through to realize that's something we need to continue to give some thought to.
[time=2553] I've got to say this. Please do. I wanted to go to seminary and for lots of reasons it didn't happen. And I realized about 31 years ago, actually it was longer.
[time=2565] It was 1975 when a guy gave me this Bible right here, this red one. And I started thinking, if I start studying this and I study it for 25 years,
[time=2574] I may know as much as the guys who come out of seminary in three or four. So I did that.
[time=2580] And the only reason I know the stuff that I know that's in here is because I valued it and wanted to know it.
[time=2587] I'm not set apart because I just wanted to be set apart. I'm set apart because he set me apart as I fed on the word of God.
[time=2595] And I want these guys have educations that I don't have. And I make blunders and they can correct me on those.
[time=2603] But if you aren't going to seminary, you can still know his word. That's my point.
[time=2610] It may take you the 25 years it took me, but it's worth it.
[time=2615] And 20 years later, I'm still trying to get half a seminary out of me.
[time=2621] No, I'm serious. I'm serious. I don't mean disrespect toward my seminary and I don't mean disrespect toward anybody.
[time=2628] I'm just saying there's something to say for an education that's true. There's something to say for life.
[time=2636] Years lived. Time spent with him. Amen?
[time=2644] Christ connects. Go through the three again.
[time=2649] Josh McDowell told me that an hour a day in the scriptures is equal to a doctorate in theology.
[time=2657] I'm a doctorate. I've got a doctor long break up.
[time=2660] And Howard Hendrix still does it.
[time=2663] That's true, of course.
[time=2664] Oh yeah, because I don't know it. I don't know anything yet.
[time=2667] So much still to learn.
[time=2668] Every encounter is a three-way call. We see that Christ connects us with God. That's the first connection.
[time=2674] Second, Christ connects us with others. And then third, what Kelly's going to address is Christ in us.
[time=2681] Christ connects others with God.
[time=2683] Watch how he does this. Still don't get it. Don't know why he chose to have us even in the equation,
[time=2689] but watch how he brings others to him. You ready? Go back to 1 Peter 2? Look at verse 11 and 12.
[time=2696] Beloved, I urge you then, in light of who you are, right? I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain.
[time=2707] What's abstain mean? Don't do it. What's abstain mean? Somebody say it out loud. Don't do it. Avoid.
[time=2715] Oh, that's a good one. Refrain. Run away. Don't step forward. Step backwards. Turn.
[time=2725] Do not proceed. Stop. Right?
[time=2730] As aliens and strangers, he says, abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
[time=2737] Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles so that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers,
[time=2743] which you're not, they may because of your good deeds as they what? Stay it out loud.
[time=2749] Observe. Observe them. You and I with the nations. You and I living among the people.
[time=2755] You and I, Christ in us living among the people and the people observing as they observe them.
[time=2766] And watch this. So that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers, they may because of your good deeds as they observe them, here it is, glorified.
[time=2775] These are people far from God who because of what they see are led to glorify God.
[time=2782] Bingo. That's it. That's the deal. I mean, that's what God's up to here.
[time=2792] Bringing these people to a point where they observe the good deeds and glorify God in the day of visitation.
[time=2800] I want you to look at those first two words there in verse 11.
[time=2804] Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers as aliens and strangers.
[time=2812] Now, some of you in the room understand that others of you might be confused by that.
[time=2816] I'll tell you what, there's been a lot of confusion on that front for a number of years.
[time=2821] This kind of gets back to what we talked about last week and Steve illustrated it again today.
[time=2826] Sometimes we think the alien stranger means that we've just got to get out.
[time=2830] That we've just got to get so removed and be so strange or be so separated.
[time=2838] When I came to know Christ at the age of 20, I was playing basketball at a large university campus.
[time=2848] It was, you know, having the chance to kind of fulfill what I thought was going to be my destiny and my dreams.
[time=2855] It was an enormous place with a huge program and I came to know Christ and I felt this thing in me that said, "You know what? That's done. You've got to get ready for what I'm going to do with you." I transferred away from there to a small Christian liberal arts college in Southern California.
[time=2871] I thought I'd just kind of keep playing basketball because I enjoyed it so much and I did.
[time=2876] It was just amazing to me how one of the first teams that we played at the small Christian college
[time=2884] was another Christian college and I won't get into the denomination.
[time=2888] That's not the point, but it was just kind of an eye opener to go from playing in arenas to we went down in the van to this place and we got out of the van and went in and changed and came out and it was a really small cafeteria building with some chairs on the side
[time=2903] and this college had a team and I remember the one, I didn't say this first hour, I forgot, the warm-up music was played by an organ.
[time=2911] They had an organ over in the corner and there's this gal over there playing the organ hymns but I don't know what the songs were.
[time=2919] And then they had cheerleaders and the cheerleaders, I'll never forget, the cheerleaders' skirts were pleated from about the midsection down below their shoes and they had these sweaters on with collars up like over their mouths and they had their hair up in a bun and I'm not making fun, hear me here.
[time=2938] I'm just, the guys, they didn't have jerseys, they wore T-shirts and it just was to me at that time in my journey, it was just the oddest thing
[time=2950] and I remember making friends over the years with one of the guys that went there and he told me, that's right, we need to be odd.
[time=2963] And I learned, I've learned over the years that there's some truth to that
[time=2970] but I think that picture I just painted kind of misses the point and I just, I wrote this down for you because I don't want you to miss this because I think we're supposed to be aliens and I think we're supposed to be strangers.
[time=2981] Those words speak primarily though to the posture and condition of one's heart,
[time=2987] not necessarily and only the length of one's skirt.
[time=2991] To be an alien, to be a stranger, it speaks primarily to the condition, the genuine state of your heart.
[time=2998] To be an alien or stranger has to do with your affections, your loyalties, your roots, there are some people who choose to become so attached to this place, so attached to this world, their affections and their passions and their pursuits become fixated on the temporal thrill of the immediate rather than the long-term joy of the external.
[time=3022] He wants you to be and he wants me to be in our hearts understanding where we belong.
[time=3028] This place is not our what?
[time=3030] We're aliens and strangers, look at 1 Chronicles 29, I think it might come on the screen.
[time=3035] I found this, this week, this one word just popped off the page and I was so thankful I found it.
[time=3042] Here's how I want you to think, maybe this will help you, maybe it won't but here's how I want you to think about being a stranger.
[time=3048] But who am I?
[time=3049] And who are my David speaking here?
[time=3051] But who am I and who are my people that we should be able to offer as generously as this, for all things come from you and from your hand we have given you.
[time=3060] Now look what it says in verse 15, for we are so journers before you and say that word out loud.
[time=3066] Tenant.
[time=3068] We're renting my friends.
[time=3074] That's what came to my mind.
[time=3076] We're renting.
[time=3078] We so want to be owners.
[time=3081] There's something in us that just so wants to sink roots here.
[time=3085] We want to hold on to this.
[time=3087] We want to have more of this.
[time=3088] We want to have all the, and I understand that to a degree but God says you know what, don't forget this place is not your what?
[time=3094] Oh, home.
[time=3096] You are tenants.
[time=3098] You're renting.
[time=3100] And I have got a place for you that I'm preparing.
[time=3104] That's something you can call what?
[time=3106] Home.
[time=3108] Aliens and strangers.
[time=3113] Who abstain.
[time=3119] Look at the rest of verse 11.
[time=3122] You say okay, okay, if I get my affections figured out, if I don't get connected to this place, if I keep my heart in its eternal home, okay, then how is it that I can help connect?
[time=3135] Okay, well look what it says.
[time=3138] As aliens and strangers, as priests, as a chosen race, a royal priest to look what we do, we abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
[time=3152] I'll tell you this right now.
[time=3155] If you want proof of how it is, if you want real,
[time=3162] hardcore proof of how it is that anything that's good in this
[time=3169] entire discussion this morning, as we get to this point where we talk about people actually getting connected to God, if you want proof of how it is that that's all about Christ in us and not about us, you look at that verse right there because who in this room is going to successfully stand and abstain
[time=3195] from fleshly lusts today that wage war against your soul and do
[time=3203] that successfully. Anybody?
[time=3210] I can't. I can't.
[time=3216] But Christ in you, Christ in me, allows you and I,
[time=3223] verse 11 and 12, allows us the capacity because of Christ in us to stand, to abstain from fleshly lusts and to verse 12, keep our behavior excellent.
[time=3238] Like never before, my friends, he wages war against your soul as it relates to the fleshly lusts and the way in which we behave.
[time=3248] And it is Christ in us and that relationship that gets cultivated, that relationship that gets grown, that relationship that gets murdered, that allows you and I, this privileged position and capacity to abstain, to say no.
[time=3266] I'm not going to click on there.
[time=3268] No, I'm not going to have that conversation.
[time=3271] No, I'm not going to look there.
[time=3274] No, I'm not going to think that.
[time=3278] You and I can't do that in and of ourselves.
[time=3282] He does that.
[time=3283] And in doing so, look what it says, they observe, they observe our good deeds.
[time=3290] And again, don't get too carried away with that.
[time=3292] It's not your, it says your good deeds, but now you and I know it's Christ in us producing these good deeds.
[time=3299] And when they observe them, they glorify God.
[time=3305] That is cool.
[time=3307] That is amazing.
[time=3308] And that is the privilege that He allows you and I to be a part of.
[time=3313] How you doing?
[time=3315] How's the abstaining going?
[time=3321] How's the excellent behavior?
[time=3324] What you say, what you do, how you respond in the workplace, in the neighborhood, in the office at night when no one's looking?
[time=3337] You do this.
[time=3339] All right, yourself.
[time=3340] Will you this week see every encounter as a three-way call?
[time=3345] Will you examine your connection to God in Christ?
[time=3350] And if you're here today and you haven't fully surrendered your life to Christ as Savior and Lord, come with the person, or talk with the person who you came with, who invited you, talk to us, the elders will be up front here at the end.
[time=3362] We'll pray with you.
[time=3363] And you can say, you know what, it was on Super Bowl Sunday, 2007.
[time=3367] I got my connection with God, crystal clear.
[time=3371] Will you see every encounter as a three-way call?
[time=3374] Will you examine your connection to others?
[time=3378] Will you allow Christ in you to connect you with others in relationship?
[time=3382] And will you allow Christ in you to connect them to God?
[time=3388] Will you see every encounter as a three-way call?
[time=3391] And 1 Corinthians 922 Paul said, you know, I see every encounter as a three-way call.
[time=3395] I connect with everybody so that they'll connect with God.
[time=3399] And Colossians 4, 5, and 6, he said, every encounter is a three-way call.
[time=3404] I connect with everybody because I'm connected with God so that they'll connect with God.
[time=3409] I'm a priest.
[time=3410] You're a priest.
[time=3411] Will you see every encounter this week as a three-way call?
[time=3418] Will you please connect in an evangelistic relationship if there's someone outside Christ who is in your world?
[time=3425] Will you please write his or her name down right now?
[time=3430] And that's the Spirit of Christ who connects you with God, who connects you with them, and who will connect them to God, the Spirit of Christ, that invisible cellular connection.
[time=3441] And in Christ there are no drop calls.
[time=3444] Will you see every encounter this week as a three-way call?
[time=3449] That's awesome.
[time=3450] I love you, man.
[time=3452] You know what I'm thinking?
[time=3453] As he's saying this, I'm thinking those electives that we told you about before.
[time=3457] If you need help in this relationship that you have with him, you want to be one who better connects.
[time=3464] You want to be one who better exemplifies what it means to live in relationship with a living God.
[time=3470] You need to understand how you can spend time each day in God's word, and it means something to you.
[time=3475] You need to understand dust of the rabbi and what it means to be a follower of Christ.
[time=3480] These opportunities have purpose to him.
[time=3483] And we hope you'll jump in and be a part of that.
[time=3487] If there's anybody here this morning, and you would just be encouraged by us taking a minute to pray with you.
[time=3491] We'll do that.
[time=3492] We've got elders down front who will come down and pray with you.
[time=3494] Thank you so much for being here.
[time=3496] Come back next week.
[time=3497] We're going to talk more about what it means for you and I, literally, to be priests in this great endeavor.
[time=3502] That God has us in.
[time=3503] Let's pray.
[time=3504] Would you stand?
[time=3505] Father God, thank you for the morning.
[time=3507] And God, I pray that this truth that we've tried our best to explain, God, that this truth would penetrate the hearts and lives of those in the room.
[time=3516] Allow us, please, the privilege of being a part of these three way calls, these opportunities, God, to represent you.
[time=3524] God, I pray we would do that well.
[time=3526] Encourage us, please, in that direction.
[time=3528] Thank you so much for Steve and for Mitch and for this time and your son's name, we pray.
[time=3533] [AMEN - 1 seconds]
