[time=374] (upbeat music) - Hi, my name's Sam Barfell,
[time=385] and I have the distinct privilege and honor of serving Christ by leading the ministry of Black Hawk Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=392] And I'm excited today to come to you and share with you something that's happening in the life of our school happens every year at this time.
[time=398] The end of January, beginning of February, we begin our re-enrollment drive and open enrollment drive for next school year, the 2007, 2008 school year.
[time=408] It's hard to believe that it's here already.
[time=410] But Black Hawk Christian School's been doing its business and engaged in ministry for 34 years now.
[time=416] We're so thankful to the Lord for all that He's allowed us to accomplish in all those years in the lives of literally thousands of students.
[time=422] Today, our enrollment is nearly 800 students in preschool, elementary, junior high, and high school.
[time=429] And I'm proud to say that our students are doing well this year, both academically and spiritually.
[time=435] One of the things I wanted to share with you that's just an exciting new development for us is that we're opening some additional preschool classes in the afternoon.
[time=442] We have a half day preschool program that we offer in the mornings and some afternoons, and now we're expanding that and offer additional classes in the afternoon as well.
[time=451] Another exciting thing that we're really anxious to tell you about is that for years, we have offered a half day kindergarten program and next year for the first time in our history, we have opened up a full day kindergarten option for those families who have that need and that desire.
[time=467] And with that, then we've also expanded our capacity for the amount of students that we can take in kindergarten.
[time=473] And so we're excited about what God's gonna do there and who He'll bring to our school to be a part of our preschool and kindergarten as well as all of our grades, grades one through 12.
[time=483] So I wanna take this moment just to invite you to visit our website to get some more information about Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=488] And you can click on BlackhawkChristian.org and get all kind information about Blackhawk Christian School, even enrollment information and the pricing structure and all the information that's there on our website at BlackhawkChristian.org.

[time=767] Pray with me, would you? Father God, we...
[time=777] It's hard to describe how thankful those of us in the room that know you.
[time=783] God, those of us in the room this morning that have experienced your redeeming grace.
[time=789] Transforming forgiveness that you bring to a life when one fully surrenders their heart and life to you.
[time=797] Father, we are so grateful for the cross and so thankful for the forgiveness and hope that it brings.
[time=804] And as we continue this morning to talk about and to look to your scriptures, God, for guidance as to how to live this life that you've given us.
[time=813] How to live it with purpose and meaning. God, how to live it with eternity.
[time=818] Not tomorrow, but eternity in mind.
[time=822] God, we pray that you would give us guidance. Keep your hand, please.
[time=827] On our time here this morning in your son's name, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[time=834] Hey, what a great... what a great song. First of all, I just... I found that song a few months ago.
[time=839] I've been, you know, me just playing it 19 times a day in my car and running it into the ground.
[time=845] And it's not into the ground yet. It's just a great, great song at the cross.
[time=849] And you'll hear it more. It's going to kind of be our theme for the resurrection celebration coming up in a couple months.
[time=856] And I just can't wait to sing it more as a family.
[time=859] What a great line or two there at the end where it says, "He tore the veil."
[time=865] Do you see that? Do you remember singing, "He tore the veil. He made a way." That thought right there, my friends, it has such significance and it has great significance to the discussion that we find ourselves in over the last few weeks.
[time=878] And we're going to continue in this study this morning.
[time=881] The discussion whereby I've been trying my best to just remind all of you that know him what the scriptures teach about you.
[time=889] And that is that you are a what? Say it. A priest.
[time=894] We've been studying the priesthood of all believers.
[time=897] And for many of you, and I've gotten some great letters and some great emails, some people who are trying to reconcile this priest thing because they grew up with an idea and a picture of a priest that looks like this.
[time=909] And here we are in the scriptures themselves describing the opportunity and really the privilege that we have as believers to be and function
[time=918] as priests. And it's been a great learning for many and I want to continue along these lines today.
[time=924] But I just couldn't help but notice in that song where it talks about, "He tore the veil." Many of you in the room understand what that's referring to.
[time=932] For others of you, let me just remind you or tell you for the first time.
[time=935] On the cross, there on Calvary, at the point there where Jesus comes to the end when He explains it,
[time=943] proclaims it is finished, when He's crucified on the cross there.
[time=948] At the very same time in the temple there in Jerusalem, there was a veil.
[time=953] And the veil was a very important piece in this whole temple picture.
[time=958] The veil was what kept the people, the common normal everyday folks from the most holy place in the temple, the holy of holies.
[time=968] And only once a year could the high priest go into the holy of holies.
[time=975] And yet at the point where Christ is crucified, at the point in which, and at the place in which He makes a way for you and I to come into relationship with the living God,
[time=986] the veil it says, at the end of Matthew it says the veil was torn in two and the veil was ripped from where?
[time=992] From what? Top to bottom, it wasn't ripped by man, it was ripped by who? God.
[time=1000] Making a way for who to come in to the most holiest of holy places?
[time=1008] You and me.
[time=1012] Priests, who get to last week, remember last week, Kohan.
[time=1016] The word Kohan means priest, it means one who draws near. What a great picture, what great symbolism.
[time=1022] We get to come in to the holiest place of all, relationship, personal, real, intimate with the living God.
[time=1029] And the word priest, Kohan, means to draw near to that God, to live in intimacy with that God.
[time=1034] So that as a priest, as a good and faithful priest, we can mediate the divine because you see God's over here and the world is over here,
[time=1044] a lost and broken world that we're not mad at, we're not angry at them, we're hopeful for them.
[time=1052] We're saddened by the brokenness and the emptiness and the futility of their lives.
[time=1058] And we don't judge them and we don't condemn them, no, we act as good priests who we've said it different ways in the last few weeks.
[time=1066] We mediate the divine, we pass along having drawn close to him, we pass along God to others.
[time=1073] The mirror, we take the reflection of God in our intimacy and in our closeness, we work as we function as mirrors
[time=1081] who take that reflection and give it to a world that needs it desperately, they need to know him.
[time=1088] They need to know what he's like.
[time=1090] Last week we said it this way, priests, Kohans, who have drawn near, they show very simply, we said it this way,
[time=1097] we show people what God is like. And I like that word show versus tell.
[time=1106] I mean, it's okay to tell them what God is like, but it's so important that you and I would what show them
[time=1113] that we would live his attributes out and so we began last week to study his attributes.
[time=1121] We agreed as a family that in the course of this study we might want to take a few weeks if it is for us, and this is the way God designed it.
[time=1129] If it is for us to reflect God to others, we might want to make sure that what we're reflecting is accurate.
[time=1137] And so we said let's take a few weeks and study and look at the attributes of God.
[time=1142] What is God like? What characterizes God?
[time=1146] How would God, if God were just going to deal with them directly, what would they see and sense from him?
[time=1153] But instead God's chosen to place you and me as believers in the middle and pass that message along.
[time=1161] So we began last week with a study on the attributes of God and we started with attribute number one, which was the love of God.
[time=1168] God is a loving God. God is love. And those that know him, those that serve him, those that are in relationship with him, communicate that love.
[time=1178] Please pick up the CD, go online and listen to it on our website.
[time=1182] You can view the message now on our website.
[time=1185] Somehow, some way if you weren't here last week, go and kind of catch up because we talked about the love of God and then toward the end of our time last week we talked about his compassion.
[time=1195] How in our effort to reflect God to others we better be a people who in our priestly function are communicating the compassion of God.
[time=1205] God's willingness to come alongside those who need someone to come alongside.
[time=1211] God's willingness to express and evidence his kindness and his mercy and his sensitivity to those that need his mercy and sensitivity and kindness.
[time=1220] Those that don't have it, those that are missing it, those that are in a bad way, those that are in bad shape, those that find themselves with great need.
[time=1229] The compassion of God, we talked about the justice of God, how he's a God who stands up for those who need someone to stand up for him.
[time=1239] The weak and the diseased and the disenfranchised and the sick, he doesn't overlook him. We saw all through the Old Testament how he hears their cry.
[time=1249] A compassionate God who doesn't look the other way.
[time=1254] And my intent was to kind of move on this morning away from the compassion of God, but I just ended up reading some things and I ended up listening to some things.
[time=1266] And I ended up, God just continued to bring things to my heart and mind, and so we're going to just continue this morning.
[time=1274] I felt like in my heart it was for us this morning to just stay right here.
[time=1281] And I think really because I know and I won't speak for you, but I think sometimes in my own heart in life I so lack it.
[time=1289] I was trying to move on to the next attribute and God kind of just said, you know what, why don't you park right here?
[time=1294] And why don't we just talk for a little bit longer? Why don't we just talk for a little bit longer about my compassionate heart?
[time=1306] And I want to show you this morning something I came across this week, it was so encouraging.
[time=1313] It was really, for me it was very exciting and so very revealing as to the heart of God and His willingness and His readiness to show compassion.
[time=1323] I want to show you the compassionate heart of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
[time=1329] And before we look at that though I want you to watch this, this is just something that many of you have probably already seen.
[time=1335] It is an amazing story, it's just a couple minutes, the sound is pretty good, the picture's okay, but I just want you to watch this.
[time=1345] I want you to watch this and as you watch this I just want you to think about why it is that stories like this so absolutely and completely grip your heart and mind.
[time=1358] Watch it, it's an incredible story, a couple minutes and I'll be right back.
[time=1363] Hey we're going to break into the broadcast here just for a couple minutes.
[time=1367] The video that we were able to watch at this point in the service, we're not able to broadcast here on the network.
[time=1375] And so I wanted to just take a quick moment and just kind of give you a brief overview of what we watched.
[time=1381] I believe Ed's going to provide you with a link on the screen here and you could even go watch the video yourself.
[time=1388] It's all over the internet and you maybe have seen it before but here's what I wanted to tell you.
[time=1393] It's an amazing story about a very special young man, a high school student who has autism.
[time=1400] And it's out on the east coast and this young man just had completely given himself to the role of manager on a basketball team,
[time=1409] a high school basketball team and he had day in and day out served and cared for and come alongside these guys on the basketball team.
[time=1419] And the compassionate heart of a coach reaches out to this young guy and having served the coach and the team faithfully,
[time=1430] the coach in the last game of the season allows the kid to dress.
[time=1435] Instead of wearing his normal shirt and tie and jacket to be the manager, he allows him to put on a jersey.
[time=1444] And there's this great part in the video, maybe you'll watch it, where the reporter says the coach lets him put on a jersey,
[time=1452] not to play necessarily, but just to feel what it's like to be on the team.
[time=1459] And I thought that was an amazing statement and I think right in that statement is something for you and I to think about when we think about compassion
[time=1468] and when we think about taking the time, making a sacrifice, going out of your way, me going out of my way,
[time=1476] when you think about you and I kind of adjusting our agenda or changing our schedule, going the extra mile to help,
[time=1487] to encourage, to come alongside and give.
[time=1490] When we exercise compassion, it is an amazing thing that goes on in the heart and the soul of the one who receives the compassion.
[time=1500] It lets them feel for a moment even that they belong.
[time=1504] It lets them feel even for a moment what it's like to be loved and to be cared for.
[time=1510] And as we watched the video that morning, it was so clear that this young man, through what he experienced, was in such a cool way,
[time=1518] experiencing what it meant to belong and compassion was the key.
[time=1523] And what is it?
[time=1525] What is it about that that has half the room right now wiping your eyes?
[time=1530] Me too.
[time=1535] What is it? What is it that communicates? What is it that's touched so deeply in you and I when we watch something like that?
[time=1543] I'll tell you what I think it is.
[time=1545] I think it reminds you and I of the indescribable incalculable worth of a single human soul.
[time=1554] I think there is just great, great, God-given value that he assigns to each and every person that walks the face of this earth.
[time=1566] And you know, sometimes there's so much stuff that gets in the way of that value.
[time=1571] But we're reminded in pieces like that and through other stories that you and I encounter that people matter to God.
[time=1582] They really, really matter.
[time=1585] And then I forget growing up having it modeled for me.
[time=1589] I've told you this before and I'm so proud and so thankful to be able to say it to you again.
[time=1594] I'm just grateful for my mother who I spent a great deal of time with growing up.
[time=1600] And if you would ask me what my memories of my mom are, I would tell you times when I was six, seven, eight times when I was 10, 11, 12 times when I was 17, 18, 19, 20 years old.
[time=1610] It doesn't matter what season of life you take me back to.
[time=1613] Time with my mom and time with others always reminded me that with her there was never anybody too difficult.
[time=1620] There was never anybody too different.
[time=1622] There was never anybody too dysfunctional.
[time=1624] There was never anybody that was too hard.
[time=1627] There was never anybody too ugly, never anybody too rich, never anybody too poor.
[time=1632] Everybody mattered.
[time=1637] Everybody matters to God.
[time=1640] And I want to show you this morning.
[time=1641] It was such an incredible thing for me to just see this week as I listened and wrote some things down and read some things that just brought this off the page as a scripture for me.
[time=1653] I want to show you this morning how deeply Jesus believed that people mattered to God and the great links to which he went to communicate that.
[time=1662] I want to show you his compassionate heart, his heart, this compassionate heart of our Lord that moved him toward even the least of them, the broken people, the ugly people, the diseased people, the different, the disliked, the disruptive.
[time=1677] Everybody mattered to him.
[time=1680] I want you to see his compassionate heart, my friend, the same heart you and I are to pass along to the hurting and the needy as we fulfill our priestly function, our priestly privilege of being mirrors that show others what the Lord is really like.
[time=1697] Open up your Bibles if you would to Mark chapter 4.
[time=1700] Mark chapter 4.
[time=1703] Now we're going to jump in at verse 35, Mark chapter 4 verse 35.
[time=1709] At the beginning of chapter 4, he began to teach again by the sea, the sea of Galilee, and such a very large crowd gathered to him that he got into a boat, it says, at the beginning of the chapter, and he begins to teach.
[time=1721] Well, at the conclusion of his teaching, look with me at verse 35, on that day, when evening came, he said to them, Christ turns and says to his disciples, the 12 that were following, the 12 that were helping.
[time=1736] He turns and says to them, let's go over to the, and I want you all to say those two words, go ahead to the other side, early on.
[time=1747] And what so far had been a very successful public ministry, Jesus drops an absolute bomb.
[time=1755] That phrase would have been to those guys in that setting, in that context, in that culture, that was an absolute shocker.
[time=1764] And it doesn't look like, at first glance, as you and I would read that, it doesn't look like an absolute shocker, but it was an absolute shocker, because you see, the other side was a place called the Decopolis.
[time=1777] The other side was the other side of Galilee.
[time=1781] The other side was a place that he had not been yet, and it was a place that they did not go.
[time=1787] I want to just show this to you so you can have a kind of a frame of reference in your mind. See, over on this side of the picture, my friends, this was the good side.
[time=1796] This was home, this is where Jesus and those guys basically were from.
[time=1801] Over here you see Nazareth, over here you see Kana, this is where the ministry had gotten off to a start.
[time=1807] Now there's the Sea of Galilee, you see the Sea of Galilee right there, there's a little red laser at the end of my finger, and I just go down here and the laser goes down everywhere.
[time=1816] There's the Sea of Galilee, and then I want you to see on the other side, and you see it down there, written kind of down at an angle, you see Decopolis.
[time=1827] Decopolis, this was the other side.
[time=1833] It's an amazing story, rabbinic tradition, and early church history reminded us as to do the events of the Old Testament.
[time=1841] Here's where this all comes from, my friends watch this. In the Old Testament God told Joshua that he would move out of the land, the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the parasites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, there were seven nations.
[time=1858] There were seven people groups that were going to be moved out, and rabbinical tradition, and Old Testament Biblical tradition has it that those seven nations of Canaan, over time, ended up settling.
[time=1871] They were overthrown, they wandered, Acts 13 tells us, they settled in the Decopolis region.
[time=1878] This is where the people far from God ended up, this is where the enemy resided, this was the dark side, this is where the pagans lived.
[time=1887] This is where people lived who didn't love and know God and didn't honor God and were definitely opposed to the nation and the people of Israel.
[time=1897] It was a land filled with pagan temples, cults, promoting sexuality and violence and wealth.
[time=1904] Decopolis was, here's the deal, Decopolis on this side was everything that Israel wasn't.
[time=1911] They were diametrically opposed. Here you go, how diametrically opposed.
[time=1918] If you were a good Jew, if you were in the nation of Israel, if you lived in that day, you would know that because of the dietary laws, for instance, what was the most unclean animal there was?
[time=1930] Say it, pig swines. Guess what they worshiped over in the Decopolis? Say it, pigs.
[time=1941] It was just like in your face. We know that you can't stand pigs, we're not going to only eat them, we're going to worship them.
[time=1950] We're going to worship pigs, they couldn't stand them, they were the enemy, that was the dark side, that was the other side and nobody went to the other side.
[time=1963] Rome had established a battalion of soldiers, Rome in their effort to conquer and exert their authority.
[time=1971] Rome had established a garrison over in the Decopolis.
[time=1975] There was a legion of soldiers in the Decopolis. Rome had set up a fort there. Excavation, now archaeology and some of the digs they've done in recent years have uncovered some of the Roman soldiers' forts and garrisons where those 6,000 soldiers lived and stayed.
[time=1996] And at the top of one of the garrisons, actually several of them ingrained into the woodwork was a boar's head.
[time=2005] It was everywhere you went over there, pigs, swines, in contrast to, in opposition to those on this side. The other side was dark, the other side was evil, the other side was demonic.
[time=2019] It was the place where Satan lived. God certainly, in the mind of a first century Jew, God certainly wasn't there. Nobody had ever gone there, certainly not, a rabbi.
[time=2032] And one day, Mark 4, the disciples hear the unthinkable. Their rabbi, Jesus, casually one day says, "Hey, let's go to the other side."
[time=2046] You can imagine what they were thinking. You can just envision in your mind discussions they must have had between themselves or thinking, has he lost his mind?
[time=2055] I mean, what gives? Have you noticed this about him? I mean, doesn't he understand the kingdom of God was supposed to come for Israel only?
[time=2064] I mean, it's almost like he doesn't know about the other side. It's almost like he thinks it's his side. It's almost like he thinks all sides are his side.
[time=2075] It's almost like he thinks every nation of the earth and all sides are going to be blessed by him someday, even the seven nations of Canaan, this strange rabbi.
[time=2087] Well, Mark 5 comes and they go to the other side. They make the trek to Decopolis. It's quite a trek. We can read about that later, but they finally get there.
[time=2098] And you know, it's interesting, as you look back through the beginning of Jesus' earthly ministry, as you look at the beginnings of his activity on this side, he drew large crowds, wherever he went, people were coming out in droves to hear what he was teaching and what he was communicating.
[time=2114] He makes the trip in Mark 5 over to the other side, over to the Decopolis, and there are no crowds, none whatsoever. There is no buzz in the air.
[time=2125] The masses have not come out to see him or hear him. There's actually, as you read here in the text, just one man, just one.
[time=2138] And what a man he was. One guy who shows up to greet Jesus as the Decopolis welcoming team on the sands there of Galilee.
[time=2150] And we read about it in chapter 5. They came to the other side, verse 1. They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the gernesanese, where he got out of the boat.
[time=2160] When he got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met him. There's a demoniac. A man possessed by demonic spirits is the one guy that greets him.
[time=2173] It says, and he had his dwelling among the tombs, and no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain, because he had often been bound with shackles and chains.
[time=2185] I had a history, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles broke in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.
[time=2193] Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs, and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones.
[time=2201] This guy is an absolute utter wreck. He is possessed by demons. He has been living in the caves.
[time=2208] He screams in the howls at night. He cuts himself with rocks and stones.
[time=2214] And seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before him, and shouting with a loud voice, he said, "What business do we have with each other, Jesus, son of the most high God?
[time=2224] I implore you by God. Do not torment me." For he had been, Jesus had been saying to him, the demon-possessed man, "Come out of the man. Jesus had been calling out the spirits.
[time=2235] Come out of the man. You unclean spirit." And he was asking him, Jesus asking the man, or the spirits better said, "What is your name?"
[time=2245] And the spirit says to him, "My name is what?" Legion. You've heard that before already this morning. Legion.
[time=2255] It's no coincidence. It's a symbolic reference to all. It's a symbolic reference to all that Jesus was up against as he makes the trek to the other side.
[time=2269] Legion, the spirit says, and we are many.
[time=2275] Now, the demons were afraid of Jesus. You and I know that. The Scriptures teach that. They have no power over the Lord. The demons were terrified and asked to be sent into a herd of what? Say it, pigs. I heard of swine. That's right.
[time=2292] They can read about it here. He began to implore him, verse 10, earnestly, not to send them out. The demons knew that Christ would send them out, and they implore him not to send them out of the country.
[time=2303] Now, there was a large herd of swine feeding nearby on the mountain. The demons implored him saying, "Send us into the swine so that we may enter them." And Jesus gave them permission.
[time=2315] Jesus, now in Decapolis, where they worshiped the what, gives the demons permission to be called out and into the what? Into the swine. It's amazing, isn't it?
[time=2328] And the unclean spirits entered the swine and the herd rushed down, demonic spirits now in the herd of pigs. They rushed down the steep bank into the sea.
[time=2339] About 2,000 of them, picture 2,000 pigs jumping off in mass suicide, into the Sea of Galilee. Incredible sight. Incredible sight.
[time=2352] You think, "Oh, how sad. Cute little pigs running off a cliff." Well, this wasn't funny to them. No, not at all.
[time=2360] To someone there in Canaan, a place where pigs were worshiped, this was very, very serious. The anti-Jew swine worship thing was everywhere.
[time=2370] In early first century history, you see this battle between good and evil, and oftentimes you see the pig or the swine kind of brought into that scenario.
[time=2381] Early first century historians tell us that when Jewish rebels tried to plot against the Roman Empire and were captured, they would be tortured and told to eat the flesh of pigs.
[time=2392] And when they refused, they would be slaughtered like pigs. This was, to a first century Israelite, a battle between right and wrong, good and evil.
[time=2403] Well, look what happens. It's just amazing. Chapter 5, verse 14. The herdsmen run away and report in the city and in the country, and the people came to see what it was that it happened.
[time=2415] These guys responsible for the pigs go and tell the owner, they go into the town, they say what happened, and verse 15, they came to Jesus.
[time=2423] The folks come out to the countryside, they came to Jesus and observed the man who had been demon possessed, now sitting down clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had the legion, and they became the people who now came out to see Jesus see the man who they knew him.
[time=2443] He had a reputation. They knew he was demon boy. They knew he was chain guy. They knew he was wacko up in the hills in the caves, screaming and howling at night, and now he's clothed and healthy and whole and in his right mind.
[time=2460] And he's standing there with Jesus, and they see this, and they start putting stuff together, and it was fascinating to me as I read this day. Look at your text. I don't know what yours says, but mine says they were frightened.
[time=2473] And they became frightened. They actually in time here asked Jesus to leave, and it just boggles my mind. Nobody looked at that and put two and two together and said hey, I got a sick mom.
[time=2487] Would you come see her? Nobody said hey, my dad's dying of disease. Would you come and heal him? Nobody said wow. Look at the power. Check out demon boy. All of a sudden he's all dressed up and all nice and cozy.
[time=2503] Wow, could you come and help? Nobody says this. They say leave. They say leave. Because he was from the other side. And if he was from the other side, he must have an agenda.
[time=2520] Because that's what they have over there on the other side, an agenda, and they're distant, and they're critical, and they're judgmental, and they're superior.
[time=2534] Those who had seen it described it to them, verse 16, how it had happened to the demon-possessed man and all about the swine, and they began to implore him.
[time=2544] They began, the people of the Decopolis began to implore Christ to leave their region. Get out. Go away. Look at 18 to 20. I want you to see this as well. What a, this just stirs your heart.
[time=2561] Just if you're willing to just read this and put yourself in this guy's sandals. Look at verse 18, as he was getting into Jesus is going to go.
[time=2572] As he's getting into the boat, he's taken off. The man who had been demon-possessed was imploring him. That word means to beg. That word means to grab onto a coattail.
[time=2583] That word means that he was weeping and pleading and begging with Jesus. Oh, please, don't leave me. I've grown up here. I've endured things you couldn't imagine.
[time=2593] I've seen stuff that led to experiences that brought me to the place in which you found me. You've healed me. It made me whole. Oh, please, please don't leave me here.
[time=2603] It implores him that he might accompany him and he did not let him. But he said to him, "Go home to your people and report to them." Jesus, the one who in the early ministry over on this side, had again and again proclaimed the coming of the kingdom of God.
[time=2625] And he had one specific line that he had used again and again and again with people. And that line was, "You come in." What? Follow me.
[time=2635] Now he crosses over to the other side. He meets this poor guy, brings his heart and soul back to a place of holiness. All the guy wants to do is follow him and he says, "No."
[time=2647] He says, "You just stay. You just stay right where you're at. Go home to your people and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you." And he went away. Did he argue? No.
[time=2664] Was he disappointed? I bet he was. But he went away and began to proclaim in the Copolis what great things Jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed.
[time=2680] So he stays on the other side and does exactly what Jesus asks him to do. Now, Jesus wants to make sure we see Jesus do this repeatedly with his disciples, his followers.
[time=2693] He just, as you read through Mark, you see him wanting to make sure that they get it. Because sometimes his followers don't get it. Sometimes his followers are a little slow as to what the big picture really is. Sometimes they would lose sight of the big picture. Sometimes his followers would forget that Jesus loved and cared deeply for all sides.
[time=2716] They would sometimes forget about the Lord's heart for the other side and they would want to just kind of hang out on their own side and talk about and think about how their side was the best.
[time=2727] They were kind of funny that way. Those disciples of Christ. So he works with him. And let me just show you a couple things that would give indication to how he kind of gradually, yet I think very powerfully, tried to work with him.
[time=2743] Would you go to Mark 8? Look at Mark 8, if you would. You go to Mark 8, one to two. We could start in Mark 6, but I think we'll start in Mark 8.
[time=2753] Let me show you this. This is just amazing how this plays out. Mark 8, one and two. This is where Jesus feeds the 4,000.
[time=2760] And in Mark 8, okay, they left Decopolis back in 5. Okay, they went back to the right side. Okay, now when we find them in Mark 8, they're back over on the other side.
[time=2774] They've made a trip back to Decopolis in Mark 8, one. In those days, when there was, again, a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "I feel compassion." See that?
[time=2789] I feel compassion for the people because they have remained with me now three days. Mark that. We'll come back to that.
[time=2797] Three days these people have remained with him and have nothing to eat. So they're back on the other side. Jesus is teaching 4,000 people three days he's been teaching.
[time=2808] After three days he says, "You know what, guys? Call us the disciples. I'm a little worried. It's been three days."
[time=2816] Okay, go back to Mark 6. Go to Mark 6, 35. Go to Mark 6, 35 and 36. This is where, and we kind of went backwards, but come back here to Mark 6, 35 and 36.
[time=2832] This is where he feeds the 5,000. And this time, all right, watch. This time he's over on the right side. This time he's over here in the good place.
[time=2841] He's over there with the home folk. He's over there doing his thing in the place where it all began. Everybody's excited. They're home. They're back where they're supposed to be.
[time=2848] Mark 6, 35. When it was almost, you see it here, when it was already quite late, day one, one day, when it was already quite late, his disciples came to him and said, "This place is desolate and it is already quite late.
[time=2868] Send them away, Lord, so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."
[time=2877] On the Israel side, disciples initiate. On the other side, on the Israel side, disciples initiate after how many days.
[time=2892] One, evening of the first day. Over on the other side, Jesus has been speaking and teaching for how many days. Three were the disciples.
[time=2902] Nothing. Jesus has to say, "Hey guys, it's been three days. I bet they're hungry."
[time=2911] On the Israel side, as he feeds the 5,000, you remember how many baskets were left over at the end. They collected the food into how many baskets.
[time=2920] 12. Write that down. 12 baskets. A very important number to an Israelite. 12 was a very sacred number to a Jew.
[time=2928] There were in the beginning, in God's original design, as God begins to unfold his redemptive plan back at the beginning of scriptures, we see him doing this through 12 tribes.
[time=2939] We all understand because we've studied and we've talked about Israel's failure, and now as he comes to the church and a new day and he begins to initiate the new kingdom here, it says in the New Testament,
[time=2949] he picks how many disciples? It's not a trick question. How many disciples? Thank you. This was no mistake.
[time=2960] He knew what he was doing in picking 12, and it was a very courageous move. By bringing in 12 disciples, he was in essence saying to any Jew, "I'm about the gospel.
[time=2972] I'm about the good news, and I am restoring. The good news is I'm restoring the community of Israel." And the 12 baskets was a symbolic indicator of the Lord's commitment to provide, the Lord's commitment to provide for his people.
[time=2988] It's okay to say that. It's okay to draw that conclusion. I believe that's a solid and sound interpretation.
[time=2996] Jesus now, remembering and reminding his people, "I am committed to providing for you." Okay, now, watch this. Go back to Mark 8. This is so cool.
[time=3007] I can't believe I get to do this, and I can't believe we get to share this together. Mark 8, "Why three days?" Here's your question. You already know the answer.
[time=3017] "Why three days and no initiative by the disciples to provide for the people?" Because guess what? They were on the what? They were on the other side.
[time=3028] Just to be sure of that, look at 731. Or you can just write it down. Mark 731. Again, right before the text in Mark 8, where he feeds the 4,000 on the other side, 731 says, "Again, he went out from the region of Tyre and came through Sedon to the Sea of Galilee."
[time=3046] "To the Sea of Galilee within the region of," say it out loud. Decopolis. But you know what? With the Lord? Here's the deal, my friends. "Sides don't matter."
[time=3059] "Sides don't matter." So he takes -- now, this is amazing. How many loaves of bread does he take in this account?
[time=3068] Seven. How many displaced tribes of people were eradicated from Canaan and reside now in the Decopolis? How many? Seven.
[time=3079] So he takes seven loaves of bread and feeds the 4,000. And how many baskets of leftovers are collected? Seven.
[time=3090] Twelve baskets collected on the other side, on the right side. Seven baskets collected on the other side.
[time=3101] You see what he's proclaiming? You begin to sense and hear and see his message. Good news. I'm committed and ready to feed.
[time=3113] I'm committed and ready to exercise compassion for all sides. Twelve baskets, seven baskets. Decopolis, Jerusalem. It doesn't matter.
[time=3120] I'm ready to feed them all, ready to meet their need, ready to give them a drink, ready to come to their aid, ready to heal and comfort the disease, ready to restore the sick and provide for the poor, and it doesn't matter which side they're on.
[time=3134] I love them, he says. I have a heart for them all. The right side and the left side, the halves and the half knots, the black side and the brown side and the yellow side and the white side.
[time=3147] The receptive side and the belligerent side, the easy side and the difficult side, the attractive and the despised.
[time=3154] Jesus loves all sides. When he says to you and I, with a torn veil, come get close to me.
[time=3169] Kohan, as a priest, come and reside in intimacy with me and then go and reflect me, a Lord who doesn't see sides, who's not afraid to cross over Galilee.
[time=3185] And begin to make an investment and offer love and care to those desperately in need.
[time=3191] I'm going to let you go, but I don't want to let you go without this. This is really, really cool.
[time=3198] This is so amazing. First time, first time that he goes from the right side over to the other side, how many people met him on the shore?
[time=3207] Say it. One, pretty messed up dude. Demon possessed, really broken, tons of issues.
[time=3216] Second time, next time he comes back over and you can just write this down, Matthew 1530 and 31.
[time=3224] I want you to see this. First time, no crowds. Just one pathetic demon possessed, wretch.
[time=3230] And they beg him, listen, they beg him to leave. First time. Next time, and he tells the guy to stay there and to share what Jesus had done for him.
[time=3240] Next time, go to Matthew 1530. Now, this is back in Matthew. This is the next time he comes over and the next time that he comes over.
[time=3248] We're not sure how long it is, probably several many months. Large crowds.
[time=3255] Some of the largest crowds in all of Jesus' earthly ministry show up the next time he comes to Decopolis. Watch this.
[time=3264] And large crowds came to him, bringing with them that nobody asked him to. They just knew how they know.
[time=3271] Large crowds came to him, bringing with them those who were lame and crippled and blind and mute and many others.
[time=3279] And they laid them down at his feet and he healed them. And here it is. Hang on. Verse 31, watch this.
[time=3285] So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored and the lame walking and the blind seeing.
[time=3293] And they, and they in Decopolis glorified the God of where?
[time=3304] Israel. Amen? How did that happen? Don't miss this.
[time=3316] One guy, one guy got told to stay. This is the, this is the power of a story, my friends.
[time=3328] This is the power of one redeemed, transformed individual who did what Jesus asked him to do.
[time=3335] And it's what Jesus asks you to do. It's what Jesus has asked me to do to tell people of the great things he has done.
[time=3343] To tell people of the miraculous healing that has occurred. To tell people and to show people, to draw near to him and as priests, as co-hans.
[time=3353] Share with an on-looking, hurting, broken world that desperately needs healing. What he did and who he is and what he's like.
[time=3363] This is the incredible story. This is the incredible lesson of a story told.
[time=3370] It is an amazing truth. One man willing to tell his story. And here's, here's another thought.
[time=3377] One man willing to tell his story in a place. Listen.
[time=3383] When Jesus came to the other side and he goes through the whole deal with the guy and he heals him and the pigs jump over the cliff and the folks come and say, "Get out."
[time=3391] And Jesus says, "Okay, I'll leave." Why do you think Jesus told the guy to stay?
[time=3396] How is Jesus going to be received at that point in the Decopolis? Good or bad? Say it.
[time=3402] How would the disciples have been received? If Jesus said, "Okay, I'll go, but I'm going to leave my 12 boys here and they're going to..."
[time=3409] How would the 12 disciples have been received at that time in that moment? Good or bad? Say it.
[time=3414] Bad.
[time=3415] So he leaves one guy who had influence. He had one guy who had proximity. He leaves one guy who has the opportunity.
[time=3425] He has the opportunity to, with the people he knew in a way that only he could go to village to village and town to town and proclaim what Jesus had done.
[time=3436] A people no one could reach. He looks at a man formerly possessed, bound and changed and living in the rocks.
[time=3447] He makes him whole and right and forgives him of his sins and gives him hope for a future and says, "Now go, I need you."
[time=3454] And he says, "The same thing to you." And he longs for you and I to be a people who would express and communicate and go to the other side.
[time=3465] What's your other side? Who is it? Who are they? Who is it in your world that would be difficult for you to go and embrace and express and communicate compassion to?
[time=3482] Where's your trip across the sea? Who is it that you and I can go to? How is it that God could use you in the hearts and lives of those that to this point,
[time=3494] haven't heard, don't know, have never seen.
[time=3498] Kohans, your priests, go and reflect him to a world that needs him desperately.
[time=3507] Father God, thank you for this time. Thank you so very much for what is always.
[time=3513] Just a perfect example that we find in your Son.
[time=3517] We know that we can't be perfect, but God we can pursue.
[time=3522] We can follow Christ and we can represent to an on-looking world your love and your compassion and your justice.
[time=3530] Oh, God help us do that well.
