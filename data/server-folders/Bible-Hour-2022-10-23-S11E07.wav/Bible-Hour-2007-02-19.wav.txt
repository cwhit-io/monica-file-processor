[time=285] He is one God in three persons.
[time=290] His name is Elheem Adoniah Yahweh.
[time=298] He is love, he is merciful, he is good and faithful, he is one God in three persons.
[time=306] He is holy and just, true and wise, he is one God in three persons.
[time=314] He is personal, he is mystery, he is self-existent, self-sufficient, he is one God in three persons.
[time=324] He is omniscient, he is omnipotent, omnipresent, he is transcendent.
[time=334] He is Father, he is Son, he is Holy Spirit, he is one God in three persons.
[time=345] The three persons of the Trinity are equal, yet separate, they have many roles.
[time=353] The Father is a builder, a potter, a farmer, he is creator.
[time=362] The Father is a shepherd, a judge, a teacher, he is a comforter.
[time=375] God the Son is Emmanuel, the beginning of creation, the firstborn.
[time=387] The Son is the most high, our redeemer, our friend, our Savior.
[time=398] God the Holy Spirit is an agent of creation, revealer of God's Word and the personal presence of God.
[time=412] He is a witness, an advocate, mediator, he is an intercessor, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
[time=420] We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us.
[time=427] He is Father, he is Son, he is Holy Spirit, he is one God in three persons.
[time=442] Hi, my name is Sam Barfel, and I have the distinct privilege and honor of serving Christ
[time=456] by leading the ministry of Black Hawk Christian School right here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=460] And I'm excited today to come to you and share with you something that's happening in the life of our school.
[time=464] Happens every year at this time, the end of January, beginning of February, we begin our re-enrollment drive
[time=470] and open enrollment drive for next school year, the 2007-2008 school year.
[time=475] It's hard to believe that it's here already.
[time=477] But Black Hawk Christian School has been doing its business and engaged in ministry for 34 years now.
[time=483] We're so thankful to the Lord for all that he's allowed us to accomplish in all those years in the lives of literally thousands of students.
[time=490] Today our enrollment is nearly 800 students in preschool, elementary, junior high, and high school.
[time=497] And I'm proud to say that our students are doing well this year, both academically and spiritually.
[time=502] One of the things I wanted to share with you that's just an exciting new development for us is that we're opening some additional preschool classes in the afternoon.
[time=510] We have a half-day preschool program that we offer in the mornings and some afternoons, and now we're expanding that and offer additional classes in the afternoon as well.
[time=519] Another exciting thing that we're really anxious to tell you about is that for years we have offered a half-day kindergarten program
[time=526] and next year for the first time in our history, we have opened up a full-day kindergarten option for those families who have that need and that desire.
[time=534] And with that, then we've also expanded our capacity for the amount of students that we can take in kindergarten.
[time=540] And so we're excited about what God's going to do there and who He'll bring to our school to be a part of our preschool and kindergarten as well as all of our grades, grades 1 through 12.
[time=550] So I want to take this moment just to invite you to visit our website to get some more information about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=556] And you can click on blackhawkchristian.org and get all kind of information about Black Hawk Christian School
[time=562] even enrollment information and the pricing structure and all the information that's there on our website at blackhawkchristian.org.
[time=584] [MUSIC - 253 seconds]
[time=851] [APPLAUSE]
[time=855] It's so good to have you here and so good to be together, weather and all, and I'm so thankful for this discussion, this study that we've been in, where we have been trying to, in some cases for some of you,
[time=866] introduce you to this thought. For others of you, maybe it's been a reminder, but the hope has been that you would begin to better understand the fact that in God's eyes, you are a what? A priest. You are a priest, a representative of God.
[time=883] Here's where the, here's where the whole discussion started, just briefly, let's kind of go back several weeks, back at the beginning of the year, January, you know, first week, we started with the idea that there was this one thing, and you know what, there are many, but we just talked about this one thing that God has always wanted.
[time=902] This one thing that God has always been about, this one thing that God has always desired, and that one thing was what? That one thing was a relationship with His creation.
[time=912] He has always been a God who's been about relationship, and as we look at the Scriptures, we realize that that relationship that God has always wanted, He's always wanted that relationship with His people to be sincere.
[time=925] He has always desired that relationship to be marked by obedience. Josh Rang came and talked to you about how that relationship all through the Scriptures got long for that relationship to be marked by an allegiance, a willingness to be committed to Him and only Him.
[time=942] We talked about how that relationship has always been. God has always wanted that to be marked by distinct living. We went to Mount Sinai in Exodus 19 where God says, "I want to have a people who are my own, what, my own possession, and I want them to be a holy people, a distinct people, different than the nations because of their love for and their relationship with me.
[time=966] It was always to be sincere and obedient, and there was always to be allegiance and distinct living." And then we came to this last part of the relationship piece of this series, and that's where we were back on Sinai still, and He said also this.
[time=981] He said, "I want my people to be a kingdom of priests, a kingdom of priests." And that's when we in our study and discussion began to look very closely at this idea of what it meant for the nation of Israel at that time, and then in time what it means for you and I, the church, to actually be and function as and take ownership of this incredible and speakable privilege of being His representatives,
[time=1009] the priesthood of all believers. And as that discussion has furthered, we've come to the realization that that word "priest" in the Hebrew was a word called "cohan," and the word "cohan" meant to what? Say it out loud.
[time=1024] Draw near. The word "cohan" means "priest," and it's one who draws near to the Father right in that relationship. See, it all ties together.
[time=1034] The "cohan," the priest draws near, and in the drawing near, the "cohan," in essence, gets God all over him or her.
[time=1042] It's just so close, and it's so intimate, and it's so regular that we become overwhelmed with, we become overrun by, we get God all over us, and with God all over us, and in us,
[time=1054] then He says He wants us to function as intermediaries, He wants us to represent Him, He wants us to pass Him along to an on-looking world,
[time=1063] that desperately needs Him because of their brokenness and because of their emptiness and because of their search for something, anything,
[time=1072] that brings meaning and life and hope. And so that's kind of where we've been. We paused at that point and said, "You know what? If all of that's true,
[time=1083] and I asked you all and you all thought it was a good idea and we felt like it was a good idea, it seemed as if it would be a healthy endeavor to kind of pause and say,
[time=1092] "Okay, if that's how that works, then we better make sure that we have a really good picture of who, of who, of God."
[time=1102] If we're going to, in our lives and in our ministry and in us fulfilling our priestly function, if we're going to show an on-looking world what God has really liked,
[time=1111] then we better know what God is really what, like. We better understand His character. We better have a decent understanding of His attributes
[time=1120] so that we can faithfully with His help pass those things along. And so we began to look at His attributes. Just a few of them. We looked at His love.
[time=1129] We looked at the fact that in drawing, near to God, you and I have experienced this amazing, incredible, unspeakable love.
[time=1135] This agape love that had nothing to do with what we've done or what we merit or what we deserve. He just loved you so much. He gave His Son.
[time=1144] And you and I are to having experienced that love up close, reflect that kind of love, the love of God to others, the love of God to those in your home
[time=1154] and the love of God to those in your workplace and the love of God to the stranger who you didn't plan on stopping and interacting with.
[time=1161] The love of God is to flow through you and me. We're to mirror God to others.
[time=1167] And then we came to a second attribute, the compassion of God. God's compassionate heart. And we spent an entire morning kind of just going through the Scriptures.
[time=1177] We started back at the very beginning and we saw from the Scriptures that the compassion of God is something that we see again and again and again
[time=1186] and again all through the great story of God's Word. The compassion of God. And we threw another word in there. The justice of God.
[time=1194] His compassionate heart that leads him to go and stand up for those who can't be stood up for on their own.
[time=1201] The compassion of God, the justice of God, the willingness for God in essence to bend over and pick up the person who needs to be cared for.
[time=1209] To come alongside and meet the need of the person who has one. The compassion of God, this heart of God that breaks over those who cry out for help.
[time=1219] We saw God to be a God who didn't look the other way. We saw God to be a God who heard their cry and came and met their need.
[time=1228] And then we were going to kind of move on and I thought, "You know what? I don't want to move on quite yet." And last week we came back and we looked at the compassion of our Lord.
[time=1238] We just wanted to kind of stay in that discussion about compassion and our readiness and our willingness to reflect that to others.
[time=1247] We looked at the New Testament. We found ourselves kind of making our way through the Gospels and seeing in such powerful ways the compassion of Jesus as He was willing to.
[time=1258] And for those of you who were here last week, this will make sense. Jesus who was willing to go to the what? To the other side.
[time=1267] Let me just take you back to where we were just real quick because I was thinking about it this week and before we go on this morning I want to just, we didn't get through all that was there last week.
[time=1276] In that message. And if it's okay, I just want to give you the rest of that message. Is that all right?
[time=1283] Is that okay? All right, good.
[time=1286] Good. Mark 4 is where we started. Just go back. I'm going to just review quickly. Mark 4.35.
[time=1291] What an amazing picture it was. And thanks so much. So many of you just wrote in.
[time=1296] I heard so many great responses from people. I know how much it means to you. I know how much it means to me to be able to see such life-giving, life-changing truth.
[time=1305] Right here in the pages of Scripture. And what we saw last week was powerful, powerful truth.
[time=1312] Matthew 4.35, on that day when evening came, He said to them, Jesus teaching the multitudes. They're actually from a boat, we said, there in Galilee, on the lake and on the sea.
[time=1327] And He gets done teaching and just kind of would appear to us in the English as we read this, just kind of casually says, let's go over to the other side.
[time=1339] Let's go over to the other side. And what that kind of moved us into was this just incredible study. And the insights that are there for us, we realized that the other side for Him to say this was just an absolute bombshell to those who would have heard it.
[time=1355] We realized as we learned together that the other side was a place called Decopolis.
[time=1362] You had on one side the, you know, Jesus and the Jews and all those in that time kind of at home over here in their land and across the Sea of Galilee was a place called, a region called Decopolis.
[time=1374] We talked about how the, how when God gave the promised land to the nation of Israel, the folks that got booted, I mean, the people that got ejected from that land, the seven tribes, the seven nations of Canaan, they in time ended up settling over here in this region called the Decopolis.
[time=1394] And they weren't a happy people. They weren't thrilled about their ejection. They didn't like God and they certainly didn't like the people of God.
[time=1401] They were antagonistic toward diametrically opposed to God and His people. They were the enemy and they were on the other side.
[time=1412] They were against what was true and right. And anything and everything they could do to communicate that they did.
[time=1418] In fact, we talked about how in Jewish culture in that day the one animal, you know, the one animal that would have been most despised, the one animal that would have been viewed as most unclean was the swine, was the pig.
[time=1430] Well, over in the Decopolis region we learned last week they worshiped swine.
[time=1436] It was the object of their religious worship. They were pig worshipers.
[time=1442] It was a place completely opposed to God and the people of God. Rome had a presence in the Decopolis. Rome and their antagonism toward the Jew.
[time=1453] Rome was there. There was a legion. 6,000 soldiers camped there in the Decopolis. It was a dark place full of the occult.
[time=1461] Full of temples where sexuality and wealth and greed and paganism ran rampant and Jesus says to them one day, "Hey guys, let's go to the other side."
[time=1472] It's an incredible, incredible move on His part.
[time=1477] So He goes as we studied and as we talked about last week, He goes and He encounters one person there to greet Him on the shore.
[time=1487] This is the demoniac there in Mark 5. The one person that's there to greet Him on His first trip to the other side is a demon-possessed, cave-dwelling, chain-breaking maniac who has possessed by spirits living out in the wilderness, screaming and crying and yelling and gashing Himself with stones.
[time=1507] The guy's an utter wreck and Jesus comes and has compassion on this guy. He removes the spirits, commands the spirits to come out.
[time=1516] The spirits come out of the man and all the spirits go into 2000, what? 2000 pigs, a herd of pigs nearby, spirits go into the pigs, pigs freak out, which you probably would if you were a pig and you had an evil spirit in you and they just went taken off over the cliff into the water, 2000 swine, dead, drowned.
[time=1536] The guy's responsible for the herd, going to town, tell everybody, the whole town comes back out, they're all upset, they're all up in arms, the pigs are dead, they're looking at Jesus, but next to Jesus they see who, remember?
[time=1550] Next to Jesus, this was an amazing, amazing thing, next to Jesus who has in essence by doing what He's done, by coming over and getting out of that boat, by coming over and healing this dear, dear man, is basically declared that the good news is coming to the other side.
[time=1572] To this God forsaken, pig worshiping, Roman infested, other side, Jesus says, here I am and here I come and I am bringing all that's good and right and true.
[time=1583] He heals the sky, the pigs go over the edge, the tall town comes out, they're up in arms, they're begging them to leave, and there's this guy sitting next to Jesus.
[time=1596] And here's the part that caught my attention, the part that caught my attention was this, it says and we read it last week that they saw him, I believe it's in Mark 5 there, and he was clothed and in his right mind.
[time=1613] You with me? I don't know if you caught it, I didn't so much. He was clothed, which implies that he wasn't.
[time=1630] So here's our guy, and I'm not trying to be funny or inappropriate. Here's a nude, crazy, psychotic, demon, possessed, cave dwelling, screaming, stung, gashing, broken, empty guy.
[time=1649] And Jesus says, you're my man. I want to do a work in the Decopolis, I'm going to leave, remember, and I want you to what? Stay.
[time=1664] And I don't know how that makes you feel this morning when you realize that he was able to work with someone like that, but he was.
[time=1674] That was his plan. What gets revealed there is that his plan for the kingdom to go forward in that region is this guy who he says, now go and tell people what I did, go and tell people how your life has been changed, go and share with people, your story.
[time=1692] And he goes and he tells his story. It was an amazing thing to see in Matthew 15. Remember? I know I'm kind of going quick here, but Matthew 15, Jesus comes back to the Decopolis. He left, the guy stayed clothed and in his right mind, now healed and ready to tell his story.
[time=1708] Jesus later in the Gospels comes back to the Decopolis, and while the first time he came, there was one degree to him, now when he comes back, Matthew 15, there's thousands of people.
[time=1719] And they're bringing him their lame and they're sick and they're blind and they're diseased and he's healing them and it says there in 1531, look at 1531 and so the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored and the lame walking and the blind seeing and they glorified.
[time=1735] They, the Decopolis, they over here, the lost, distant people who hated God, they now worship the God of what? Of Israel.
[time=1748] Jesus brings the good news to the other side.
[time=1754] He begins to basically eradicate any talk or any thought of sides and this, this man and all that he had been through was his plan.
[time=1768] This man and all that he had experienced and the healing that God brought to his life, he was his plan.
[time=1775] I'll never forget, I really won as long as I lived being a senior in high school and many of you know I played basketball.
[time=1780] I loved to play basketball, played football and it was, it was my life, it was, I gave everything I had to those endeavors and my senior year in basketball, we had a very, very good team.
[time=1790] And we got to the end of my senior year and as always, it always seemed to go this way, as always, we were playing in the last regular season game of the year, Fremont, Fremont High School.
[time=1803] For the Deansa League title and we had played Fremont again year after year after year, it was a bitter and heated rivalry.
[time=1812] Two, three thousand people, nothing for Indiana, I realize, but it was California, give us a break.
[time=1818] Two, three thousand people, they don't even build gyms out there at high schools like they do here, it's incredible, but we were, we were packed.
[time=1825] And it was an amazing night and whoever won the game won the championship outright, we hadn't won the championship outright in five years.
[time=1832] So here we'd already lost it three years of my high school career, we were hoping this time we could pull it off and what stood in our way was number 44, his name was Scotty Lamson.
[time=1843] Scotty Lamson was absolutely amazing, Scotty Lamson was unstoppable, Scotty Lamson was, he was on his way to USC, Scotty Lamson absolutely made the best of basketball players look absolutely ridiculous, he was so talented and so strong and so big and so fast.
[time=1861] And I knew him and we played ball together in the summer and I knew what was going to happen and it happened almost every night, every night we'd have a game.
[time=1868] The coach would come in, we'd sit down and he'd get around to the point where he'd look at me and he'd say Kelly, he'd say Bird, you're guarding and I would always guard the best guy on the other team.
[time=1879] And usually that was okay, but whenever we played Fremont, there was always this hope in me that maybe he'd change his mind.
[time=1885] Maybe somebody else would guard Scotty Lamson, but no that night he came in, sat down and you could hear him that the floor was pounding out in the gym, the bands are playing his bird, you've got 44.
[time=1896] And I thought that night, maybe what he might say is this, Bird you've got 44 and Paul Boswell, my buddy Paul Boswell, Paul you're going to actually help.
[time=1903] I thought for sure he'd say Paul, we're going to double team Scotty Lamson tonight.
[time=1907] I thought for sure, in fact I thought he might even say Marty, Marty abate my other buddy who went on to play at San Jose State, Marty you're going to come over and help too, we're actually going to triple team Scotty Lamson tonight.
[time=1916] I thought maybe he might say that, but he didn't.
[time=1922] I'd never forget him just looking at me saying, "He's all yours." And having that feeling of, "Oh my goodness, I'm the plan."
[time=1937] And you know one day Jesus looked twelve, raggedy, scared, not so stellar guys in the face and looked him right in the eye and he said to them, "Guys, you're my plan.
[time=1955] You're garden Scotty Lamson. You're it. All of redemptive history. Everything that takes place from this point forward.
[time=1965] I'm giving you an all authority, Matthew 28, right? All authority has been given to you."
[time=1971] And in Acts 1 he says, "And the Holy Spirit will come. The Holy Spirit will come upon you and you will be my witnesses," he said, "in Jerusalem, in Judea, in Samaria, and the outermost parts of the earth.
[time=1982] You are my redemptive plan for all of human history from this point forward." And I can imagine Jesus saying or thinking, "I know, I know. I raised the dead. I know. I'm the one that walked on water. I turned the water into wine.
[time=1997] I healed the lame. I gave the blind their sight, communicated truth to thousands and fed the thousands.
[time=2004] I know. I know. And not one of you has ever spoke a sermon in your life. Not one of you has ever made the broken hole. I know.
[time=2014] But you're going to be okay.
[time=2018] I'm leaving.
[time=2020] You're it.
[time=2022] You're my plan.
[time=2026] And when you think about those guys, when you think about what we know about them, when you think about what we've seen about their character and what you've seen and come to understand about the way they function.
[time=2038] It's really almost laughable. I read this this week and I just wrote it down because I didn't want to mess it up. I thought it was so profound and I got a kick out of it.
[time=2045] It was a laughable thought and somebody kind of penned it this way. If you were a Martian looking down at planet Earth in the first century in 35 AD, who would you have put your money on?
[time=2059] Who would you think was more likely to survive? Christianity or the mighty Roman Empire?
[time=2067] Who would have who would have bet on the ragtag group of a few hundred people claiming that an obscure carpenter from Nazareth had risen from the grave when Rome had all of that power.
[time=2080] And yet today I like this and yet today we give our children names like Peter Paul and Mary and name our dogs Caesar and Nero.
[time=2089] How in the world he asks here, how in the world did that happen? How did Christ followers prevail?
[time=2096] Really? I mean you and I are evidence of the fact that they did. They prevailed.
[time=2107] What did they just get better at arguing religiously? Did they just get really smart somehow? Did they outsmart the culture? Did they outthink them? Did they have more money?
[time=2123] Did they have bigger buildings? Did anyone else? No. I want you to listen to this. That's not how it happened. Here's how it happened.
[time=2131] And this I want you to catch, this I want you to write down, and this is where I want you to go with me this morning as we think this through and wrap this up.
[time=2138] There's one reason why the early church, I believe, prevailed. There's one reason why it is that God threw them how they won the day. Really, one reason and one reason only, and here it is.
[time=2152] The presence and the way of Jesus was so strongly in their midst that they became good news for the other side.
[time=2166] I want you to write that down. Here's how it worked, my friends. Here's how we got from a ragtag bunch of nobodies to a movement, the kingdom of God moving in and through the entire known world.
[time=2181] The presence and the way of Jesus was so strongly in their midst that they became good news for the other side.
[time=2191] And you know what, the world had, and it's a matter of pure historical record, the world had never seen anything like this ever.
[time=2199] And I want to just give you a few examples, not made up, not fictitious. I want to just give you a few examples from early church history as to how this thing began to play itself out.
[time=2210] How these people practiced and lived out the very presence of Jesus in the way in which they functioned. You can write a few of these things down.
[time=2219] Number one, just write this down. In the Roman Empire, in the Roman Empire that day there were different socio-economic classes.
[time=2227] In the Roman Empire in that day, people of a different socio-economic class lived on the other side.
[time=2235] That's how it got divided, it's how it got viewed. Because it was an extremely status and class-dominated society.
[time=2243] Roman culture was strictly hierarchical, and people were divided into classes. Here's how it worked. You can just write this down.
[time=2251] Number one, top class, top of the heap, the equestrian class. That's right. The equestrian class, rich, extremely rich.
[time=2261] Wealthy enough to own, you guessed it, horses. A horse was a symbol, a horse was a sign of unbelievable wealth.
[time=2269] And the equestrian class was the top of the line. Financially and politically, they owned and ran everything.
[time=2276] They were the elite. Right underneath the equestrian right this down came the Decurian, D-E-C-U-R-I-A-N, the Decurian class.
[time=2286] Still very wealthy. Some political clout just under the equestrian class. Then there were citizens. A citizen class.
[time=2295] Less wealth, true, but still full rights and full privileges of a Roman citizen.
[time=2302] The equestrian class, the Decurian class, the citizen class, then came right below citizens. You had the freed people.
[time=2309] That's right, the freed people. They had once been, as their name indicates, they had once been slaves.
[time=2316] But for whatever reason now, they had purchased or obtained their freedom. Not a lot of rights, maybe just a few.
[time=2324] But the freed people now down toward the bottom. And at the very bottom of the ladder, the lowest class of individual was your slave.
[time=2335] Bottom of the line existed only to be used, meant only to serve.
[time=2341] And then, in the midst of that class culture, it was very clear that you would show what your status was.
[time=2349] There were a number of different ways how you would show or express, how people would know what class you were in.
[time=2355] And one of the ways of the many was clothes.
[time=2359] Clothes and what you would wear was a clear indicator of what class you were in. If you were a citizen, if you were a citizen or above, you were allowed to wear a toga.
[time=2369] Everybody knows what a toga is. Those of you 35 and over, animal house. Don't think about it too long, but just, that's a toga.
[time=2378] 35 and under, ask your parents.
[time=2381] Toga, they could wear a toga as a sign of class and status, if you were a citizen or above, and curions and equestrians even could wear stripes, colored stripes on their togas to show their level and their status.
[time=2399] If you were a slave or a freed people, no togas whatsoever.
[time=2403] One author I listened to read this week said it's hard to believe, isn't it? That there was actually a day when human society was so superficial that clothes were used to declare a person's worth.
[time=2419] Hard to imagine, but there really was a day when it was really that bad.
[time=2425] Slaves, slaves at a public meal, for instance, but whenever they would have a public gathering, whenever there would be a reception, whenever there would be a party, whenever a meal was served, equestrians first, equestrians, decurions got what was the very best, the choicest of the food.
[time=2441] I mean, it was prepared for them, it was served for them, and then on down the ladder, you would go until that the end of the night, if there was a crumb left, if there was any meat on the bone.
[time=2452] I mean, at the bottom of the bag, if there was anything left that would get shoved off a table, that's what a slave would be given to eat.
[time=2460] That's how they were looked at, that's how they were treated, that's the way life was in that day, but then on to that scene comes this new, odd community of Christ followers called the church.
[time=2476] And they thought to themselves as they experienced all this, as they lived in the midst of all this, they thought to themselves, wait a minute, this isn't how Jesus did it.
[time=2484] He didn't seem to be about classes, he didn't seem to go around making distinctions of different people, it didn't seem to matter to him who you were or where you were from or what you looked like, smelled like, suffered from.
[time=2501] They remembered what it said in Mark 10, 45, where he said the son of man had not come to be served but to what, but to serve, to give himself away, to whoever needed to be served, and to give his life a ransom for many.
[time=2517] Mitch and I were talking a little bit ago, in between the services, and we were talking about the Samaritan woman at the well, you just write that down, you know, the woman at the well, she was a Samaritan woman.
[time=2528] I mean there's tons of examples I could give you this morning, but think about this, the heart of our Lord and his readiness to look right past any distinctions that might exist in some socio-economic or political or even religious culture.
[time=2545] She was a woman, men didn't talk to women, she was a Samaritan, Jews didn't talk to Samaritans, she was immoral.
[time=2557] She's sleeping with all these guys and the ones she had now wasn't her husband, she was right in the midst of all this immorality, she's a Samaritan, she's a woman, she's immoral.
[time=2568] And in the kindest, most gentlest of ways, he sits her down and spends time with her and talks to her and pursues her and begins to help her reveal the need of her heart and soul.
[time=2581] And the disciples come back, remember, they're like, "What are you doing?" and he says, "What do you mean, what am I doing?" It says, "What I've come to do, I've not come to be served, but to serve." So imagine this, true story, this really happens, you can read about this in the church history books.
[time=2597] What would happen was this, it's an amazing picture, just get ahold of this, a slave, a slave, someone from the slave class would be invited to a gathering of this strange, odd community of Christ followers.
[time=2610] And in that gathering, they would oftentimes share a meal, so picture this, you're a slave.
[time=2616] And you've never been served your entire life.
[time=2623] Nobody's ever done anything, nothing for you, ever.
[time=2629] All you've ever been is a piece of property, all you've ever been is abused, all you've ever been has worked into the ground by people who weren't even thankful for you.
[time=2638] You're a slave, you're on the lowest part of the ladder, and you come to this gathering, they're sharing a meal, and picture this, an equestrian, someone from the equestrian class who has come to faith in Christ.
[time=2654] And they're part of the gathering, and all of a sudden you're a slave, and you look up, and an equestrian is bringing you a bowl of stew, and you just start to weep.
[time=2667] You just start to cry because nobody has ever, ever served you much less, one of them.
[time=2677] And here's the cool thing, so the slave's weeping, here's the cool thing, the equestrian, the equestrian starts to weep.
[time=2686] And you know why? Because never in all his day or her day, with all of his or her wealth and pleasure, never have they ever experienced the joy of serving.
[time=2701] And God does an miraculous thing as he knits hearts, red, yellow, black, white, red-collar, blue-collar, educated, uneducated.
[time=2710] He knits these people's hearts together. And this little band of faithful Christ followers, they begin to live out this faith that saw beyond the lines, saw beyond the classes, and went to the other side.
[time=2725] Jesus comes to the other side and begins to diminish and erase all lines. Another example, write this down.
[time=2734] In the ancient world, most of you can answer this question, in the ancient world was it better to be born a girl or a boy?
[time=2741] Answer, boy, much, much better. In the ancient world being born, female was not a good thing.
[time=2749] One historian writes that discarding, that the discarding and literally the literal throwing out of female infants was legal.
[time=2758] It was morally accepted and widely practiced by all social classes in the Greco-Roman world.
[time=2766] Women were worth nothing. Females were viewed as objects. Little girls were seen as zeros. Nothing of no benefit, no worth, no value, zero, zilch, nada.
[time=2785] And they weren't just abused and viewed as just property, but they were literally as newborns tossed out with the garbage.
[time=2794] They were so despised. That's reality. That's what it was like. And into that culture steps this odd, strange group known as the church.
[time=2808] And they remembered that Jesus treated women with honor and respect, that he taught them and loved them and valued them appropriately.
[time=2818] And that he received them into his community. And the followers of Christ remembered that Jesus taught that life is sacred, little boy babies and little girl babies, all life.
[time=2830] Interesting, in that time under Caesar Augustus, I learned this week, under Caesar Augustus in Rome, widows, widows were, if you were a widow in that culture, you were forced to remarry if your husband died.
[time=2843] You were forced. It didn't matter who you were. It didn't matter where you came from. If you were a widow in that culture, they forced you to remarry or they would tax you, double sometimes, triple.
[time=2855] Mistreated, unlocked, widows, and yet in this new community of Christ followers, care for widows was one of the marks of a genuine and authentic faith.
[time=2871] One of Christ's early followers, you would know him as the Apostle Paul, he wrote this in Galatians 3. It's a powerful couple of verses.
[time=2879] Paul speaks to this issue in Galatians 3. He says in Galatians 3.26, "For you are all, everybody, all of you, you are all sons of God.
[time=2889] When you come to faith, when you come to faith through Christ, for all are sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus." In 27, it says, "For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ."
[time=2905] And then in verse 28, there is in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek. Here he goes, erasing the lines. Here he goes, knocking down the walls.
[time=2914] Here he goes, leveling the playing field for everybody. And he says, "No more sides. There's no more decropolis, there's no more Jerusalem."
[time=2924] And he says, "Neither Jew nor Greek, there's neither slave nor free, there's neither male nor, say it." He valued them in a time where they were so disvalued, where they were so beaten down.
[time=2940] They wonder that women flocked to this new community of Christ followers, and they continued to flock when they sense and realize that there they are treated with kindness and dignity and respect.
[time=2958] When we do this, how do we get from a ragtag bunch of guys way, way, way less than stellar, afraid and scared and full of character flaws and a lot that still needed to be learned?
[time=2970] How do we get from that to the kingdom of God moving forward, reaching hundreds of thousands of people?
[time=2980] Here's another example. Two times, you can write this down, two times in the early history of the church, I believe it was 165 and 251 AD.
[time=2991] There was widespread deadly epidemics that killed up to, check this out, killed up to a third of the entire population in the empire in that time, probably smallpox, something like that.
[time=3005] Roman historians write of young and old being abandoned and literally pushed out of their homes and relationships and society by the thousands they were being abandoned.
[time=3017] Children and the elderly left to suffer and die alone on street corners in ditches and refuse heaps and the new community of Christ followers, this odd but faithful group.
[time=3030] In the midst of that, they remembered, you know what Jesus didn't, Jesus didn't do it that way.
[time=3038] Jesus, Jesus didn't do it that way, Jesus touched, Jesus touched the Matthew 8, go to Matthew 8 real quick.
[time=3046] What a great picture, this is Matthew 8-1, when Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him and a leper, the dirtiest, the sickest of any person in that culture.
[time=3059] The disease that was feared by all, the leper, lepercy, a leper came to him and bowed down before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean, they want to leave me at the refuse heap, they want to push me out the door, they're going to leave me on the street corner, they're going to shove me in the ditch."
[time=3081] What are you going to do with me? Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean. Remember now, Jesus could have, because he was God, Jesus could have thought him healed, Jesus could have kept his gloves on, Jesus could have kept his mask on, Jesus could have kept his distance and just thought him well, right?
[time=3105] Look at verse 3, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, I love that. Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing, be cleansed," and immediately his lepercy was cleansed.
[time=3123] And so, in that day, my friends, the church took sick people in. In that day, the church gave themselves and their resources to those who were sick, diseased and dying, even at the risk of their own lives.
[time=3138] And this is how the good news, my friends, this is how it got done, this is how the gospel got to the other side. The church turned culture upside down, they served and loved and embraced the difficult, the detestable and the diminished, and what was at the onset, a ragtag group of a few became hundreds of thousands.
[time=3161] And here's the point of last week and this week, here you go, it's your turn. Many of you in the room are faithfully giving yourselves to that kind of endeavor, with that kind of heart, many of you in the room, functioning faithfully in your priestly privilege to pass along a heart of compassion to those in need, whatever that need might look like.
[time=3184] And while that need is, yes, the physical, while that need is, yes, the diseased, while that need is, yes, those in great physical pain in conditions that require enormous amounts of effort and energy on your part and mind to come alongside.
[time=3200] Don't forget that the needy are also the five-year-olds down the hall who are starving to death. No, not physically, most of them had cereal this morning, but they need the word of God.
[time=3216] They need the bread of life. And you and I have an opportunity to exercise, and the early church did that very thing.
[time=3225] It's your turn in mind. And if the church, you and I, if we will truly and really and genuinely reflect him as good cajons, as good priests, if we will reflect this, if we will bring him to them, if we will show people, not just talk about it, but show people what God is like.
[time=3249] The kingdom of God moves forward. Very interesting in the Old Testament, those that would live this way with great compassion and care for others were often referred to as righteous.
[time=3259] Write this down. They were often referred to in the Old Testament. The word is "sadaheem" in the Hebrew, "sadaheem." It's an Old Testament word for righteous. Write the word righteous down.
[time=3269] Here you go. That word is defined like this. Those willing to disadvantage themselves. Be careful now. This could be dangerous for you. I need to warn you.
[time=3279] Because this is what it's about. This is about you and I living out the righteousness of God as a holy people, a kingdom of priests.
[time=3289] Those willing to disadvantage themselves in order to advantage others for God. You and I who are advantaged, you may be more advantaged than me, me may be more advantaged than you in terms of what maybe I can give or offer.
[time=3306] Who knows? The fact of the matter is we learned a while ago in this room that we're all rich. We've all been given great resources financially. We've been given great resources with time and talent and treasure.
[time=3319] And to the advantaged, he says, be willing to disadvantage yourself so that another can be advantaged, so that another can be helped, so that another can be encouraged, so that another can be given hope.
[time=3337] And so you have to ask yourself this morning, mother, father, young adult, businessman, senior adult, 20-something, young married, high school kid, coach, teacher, pastor, am I this kind of person?
[time=3362] I can't answer that for you, but I do know this, this is to define you.
[time=3370] Are you this kind of person? And more than that, I guess I would want to say this, are you willing?
[time=3377] Because my friends, we're on a journey together and I would just want you to be so willing to be this kind of person, to repent of what you may need to repent of, to move away from what you might need to move away from,
[time=3389] to let go of what maybe you might need to let go of, but to be a people, willing to be priests, willing to represent him and my friends, he was compassionate.
[time=3404] He was about justice and he was about a few other things as well. Look at the screen, I'm just going to give you these and we're going to go, we'll come back and talk about these later.
[time=3412] We've been talking about the attributes of God and his love, my friends and his compassion. I want you to just write a few more things down, I want you to write down his forgiveness.
[time=3421] God is love, God is compassionate, God is forgiving.
[time=3425] My friends, when you draw near to God and get forgiven and if you're here today and you know him, if you're here today and you have the privilege of living in relationship with God, he forgave you.
[time=3437] You've been forgiven much and you keep getting forgiven much, amen?
[time=3444] Then you had better be and I had better be people who are willing to take that forgiveness and how dare you, how dare you, or how dare me, how dare we ever withhold that from anybody.
[time=3463] Ever, Kohan, I drew near, I got forgiven, I mirror the forgiveness of God. His truth, I want you to write that down.
[time=3473] God is truth, everything about God is right, everything about God is true, everything about God is good and the truth of God, his word, his character, his ways were to be truthful people who live and represent what is true and right in the relationships
[time=3492] and the opportunities we have and he is holy. God is a holy God and he says I am holy, so you be holy Kohan's, represent me.
[time=3504] We're going to keep going on this, we're going to keep going on this next week, we're going to talk about you and I being priests at work, we're going to talk about being priests at home, we're going to be talking about being priests at school and it's going to be a great few more weeks.
[time=3517] Would you stand and let me pray and we'll go. Father God thank you again for the great insights of your word and God thanks for the lessons that we can learn from history, real history, real people who by faith and with great trust followed you.
[time=3534] May we do the same in your son's name we pray. Amen.
