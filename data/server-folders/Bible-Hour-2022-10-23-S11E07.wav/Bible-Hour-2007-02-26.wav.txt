[time=177] - Well hello everybody and welcome again to the Bible Hour broadcast.
[time=180] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving here at Black Hawk as a senior pastor and I'm so thankful for what I have the privilege each and every week, really each and every day to be a part of, we are so grateful for what God is allowing us to see take place in and through this ministry.
[time=198] And I had several emails this past week.
[time=201] I've had several hallway conversations, even some conversations out in the public at the gas station at the grocery store in recent days, people just thanking me for what's available on our website.
[time=214] And I just wanna make sure that those of you in the viewing audience know what's there.
[time=218] It's a fantastic website with a great deal of information, but along with the information, I think it gives you a great chance to connect with us.
[time=227] And of course, that's what we're most interested in, connecting with you.
[time=231] We're so thankful for you.
[time=233] And I want you to know you can go and listen to, even view our messages.
[time=237] What you see here on the Bible Hour, you may wanna remember this and pass this along to some friends.
[time=242] What you see on the Bible Hour is available online.
[time=245] You can go to our website and click on the resource link.
[time=249] And there you can kind of navigate your way to actually watch the video of the broadcast each and every week.
[time=255] There's so much information about our children's ministry, our student ministry, things going on through Blackhawk here and around the world.
[time=262] And we would love for you to just spend some time checking out the website, blackhawkministries.org is where you'll find us.
[time=269] And if you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask.
[time=273] Hey, I wanna make one more very special announcement.
[time=276] I wanna just tell you something I'm very, very excited about.
[time=279] On the 25th of March, we will be concluding this current series that we're in.
[time=285] It has been a tremendous study for us, a great discussion around Blackhawk regarding the priesthood of all believers.
[time=293] If you've been watching, you know that we've been encouraging you.
[time=295] Those of you that know the Lord, those of you who have a relationship with him, the scriptures say clearly that you are a priest.
[time=303] And we've been trying to teach you more about that and help you know and understand what it would mean to live out your priestly function, representing God, literally, like a priest, mediating the divine to an on looking world.
[time=318] And it has been a very, very encouraging study.
[time=321] We've had a great time searching the scriptures and learning as we go, what it means and what it looks like to literally be priests in this current culture.
[time=330] The conclusion of this series comes on the 25th of March and I've asked Pastor Rick Hawks at the chapel.
[time=338] Rick, as most of you know, some of you may not know, Rick was once the senior pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=344] And we are so looking forward to having him.
[time=346] He and his wife, Kathy, have been very, very kind and so incredibly generous to Deborah and I.
[time=353] They have become good and close friends and I am, we are so thankful for the ministry that God has out at the chapel.
[time=360] And Rick has agreed to come back to Blackhawk on Sunday morning, both services nine and 1045.
[time=366] And we're looking forward to him being here.
[time=368] I think Rick was the pastor here in the 60s, maybe a little bit of the 70s.
[time=373] And actually, I'm just kidding.
[time=375] He was the pastor in the late 70s and 80s.
[time=377] He's not that old, but we love giving him a bad time.
[time=380] You'll enjoy it.
[time=381] You really will.
[time=382] I invite you to come.
[time=383] Be a part of that Sunday if you'd like to.
[time=385] And again, know that we're always here for you.
[time=387] We'd love to meet you.
[time=388] We'd love to see you face to face.
[time=390] And we're so thankful that you tune into the broadcast each and every week.
[time=394] Hey, God bless you.
[time=395] Have a great week.
[time=396] And remember, if you know the Lord, be a priest.
[time=400] Represent him well.
[time=401] And we'll look forward to seeing you soon.

[time=681] [APPLAUSE]
[time=686] Hi, I'm Sam Barfell, and I serve as a superintendent of what I think to be one of the best Christian schools in the state of Indiana.
[time=692] Right here at Blackout Christian School in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=695] And I'm talking to you today because I want to invite you to consider and explore the possibility of having your child become a student at Blackout Christian School for the 07/08 school year.
[time=706] This is the point of the school year where we've begun what we call our re-enrollment cycle.
[time=710] And we've given our current families that first opportunity to get their students re-enrolled for next year.
[time=715] And now we're at that point where we're opening up our enrollment and our registration for new families in our community
[time=721] who have not been a part of Blackout Christian School.
[time=723] And that's why I would like to warmly invite you to explore that as a possibility for your family.
[time=729] Also, there's several new and exciting programs for next year, which I am very thankful for.
[time=734] First of all, in our preschool program, we have a three, four, and five-year-old preschool.
[time=738] And we've expanded that, and we now will be offering four-day-a-week program with afternoon classes as well.
[time=744] In addition to that, another new program next year is our full-day kindergarten option.
[time=749] For our 35 years of history, we have always had a half-day program in kindergarten.
[time=754] And next year, we're happy to say that we're creating a new full-day kindergarten option.
[time=759] And already, there are many families who have indicated their desire to have their five-year-old child be a part of our full-day and half-day kindergarten.
[time=768] So if you are interested in the possibility of being part of the Blackout Christian School community, I invite you to visit our website at BlackoutChristian.org.
[time=775] And all the information is there that you need with pricing structure and information about all of our programs, preschool, elementary, junior high and high school.
[time=783] Hey, we just want to remind each and every one of you this morning.
[time=787] Don't know where you've been this week.
[time=789] Don't know if you're here this morning.
[time=791] Absolutely utterly elated over what God is doing and the opportunities He's giving you.
[time=798] Things may be going as you had hoped.
[time=800] You may be in a good place with your spouse. Things might be going well with your kids.
[time=805] You may see God doing great things, and you may feel this morning extremely encouraged.
[time=811] There are others of you who may be here, and it's not that way.
[time=815] For you, the reality of your life today is that you're hurting.
[time=819] You're discouraged. You're lonely. You're not quite sure how it's going to go.
[time=824] And you could really use some help.
[time=827] We've all been in both spots.
[time=831] And we all know what a nice thing it is to just have somebody come alongside and encourage you and pray for you and lift you up.
[time=838] Mitch and I would love to, if we could, mean it'd be.
[time=841] And not just Mitch and I, but every person on this team here at Blackhawk, if we could just grab a pew and just catch up with you for 20 minutes, we'd do it.
[time=849] Wish we could.
[time=851] But I'll tell you what, there'll be elders and staff down here at the end of our time today, would just be encouraged if it would help to just have somebody put their arm around you and pray with you.
[time=861] We would love to do that.
[time=862] So remember that at the conclusion today, if you want to come down and pray, we'll pray with you, and we're really, really thankful for the opportunity to do so.
[time=871] Hey, I want to draw your attention to the pictures behind me.
[time=874] Isn't that great?
[time=875] I want you just to look at that wall of priests, and it reminds us that we have been,
[time=881] in a discussion now in a study for several weeks about the priesthood of all believers.
[time=886] What do we mean by that?
[time=887] What we mean by that is this, when somebody, young or old, somewhere in between, red, yellow, black, white, professional, blue collar, white collar, doesn't matter when anybody comes to faith in Christ, no matter where you've been, no matter who you are.
[time=903] The Scriptures teach clearly that in coming to faith in Christ, he brings you in as his own possession.
[time=909] You become a royal priesthood.
[time=911] You become one who has been given divine and special and unique gifts.
[time=915] You're given unique and very special opportunities.
[time=918] And he calls you, you and myself and others who know him, to function as his representatives.
[time=925] He calls us to function as mediaries.
[time=927] We as priests mediate the divine by saying I'm a priest, what you're declaring is I'm a child of God,
[time=934] willing to function in this life by God's design.
[time=938] And God's design was that you and I would show people what he's like in the way that we communicate
[time=944] and live out his love and his compassion and his grace and his forgiveness and his truth and his holiness.
[time=952] In 11 and 12 year olds, you know, and can do that.
[time=956] And young moms can do that.
[time=958] And whether you work in a lab or whether you work in a business office, whether you're a mom at home, whether you're 65 or 25, whether you work here at Blackhawk Ministries or whether you work for the city, whether you're an attorney or a doctor, it doesn't matter, whether you clean restrooms, deliver pizza.
[time=976] Everybody who knows him, he says, is a minister of the gospel.
[time=984] A priest with a clear and very, very important function in the body of Christ.
[time=992] You are the church and the church because it possesses the gospel, because of Christ in us
[time=1000] and this great endeavor that he has us on.
[time=1003] We have this opportunity, this privileged opportunity to go to a lost, broken and confused world
[time=1009] and fulfill our priestly function.
[time=1012] And so when you stand in front of that camera and hold that sign and you declare you're a priest, it's a very, very significant proclamation.
[time=1020] And in the coming weeks, we're going to do more with this, but I want to just remind you this morning how encouraging that is to see all of those faces.
[time=1028] If you haven't gotten your picture taken, if you're not up on the wall, we need you to be on the wall.
[time=1032] We need you there with us. We need you to get your picture taken today.
[time=1036] It'll be the last Sunday that you can do that.
[time=1038] So please, individually, with some friends as a family, go get your picture taken, hold your plaque and declare your willingness to be part of what God has called us to do as priests.
[time=1049] Look at Romans 15. Would you stand this morning?
[time=1052] I think this is going to come on the screen. I want to read this to you.
[time=1055] In the last few weeks, I've been reading everything I can get my hands on that relates to our priestly function.
[time=1061] And I found this in Romans 15, 14. It says this, and I want to share this with you this morning.
[time=1066] And then we're going to mention I jump in to our continued discussion.
[time=1070] Paul writes to the church at Rome, "And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to admonish one another.
[time=1083] But I, verse 15, "But I have written very boldly." You see that? This is very important here.
[time=1090] Paul says, "I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God, so as to remind you again to be a minister of Christ Jesus, reminding you this morning, boldly, to be a minister, whoever you are, wherever you are, to be a minister." You see that? Of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles.
[time=1117] Ministering as they say it out loud, go.
[time=1121] Ministering as a priest, the gospel of God, so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
[time=1132] Father God, we stand before you this morning so grateful for the opportunity to do so, thankful to be in this place and thankful God to open our hearts and our minds again to your life changing.
[time=1143] Eternity altering truth.
[time=1147] And we pray, God, this morning, that all who are here would be willing, and with great humility, God, that we would all be willing to receive what you would have for us, that it would, because of you, God, make a difference in our lives, that we would be teachable and moldable, God, that we could, as your people, fulfill our priestly opportunity to represent you,
[time=1170] to pass along you to others.
[time=1174] God, give us more and more understanding this morning, and God, with that understanding, give us courage and a readiness of heart to apply it in your son's name we pray.
[time=1184] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1186] Dr. Cruz, take it away.
[time=1188] Well, the question we'd like to address today is how do I be a priest at work?
[time=1193] How do I be a priest at work?
[time=1196] And Kelly and I spent some time together and started thinking about the problems, the barriers to becoming a priest at work, and we got a few we're going to share with you.
[time=1206] Yeah, some just some typical classic general problems that we think come up when we start talking about you and I fulfilling our priestly function in the office, in the marketplace, wherever it is that you go to work.
[time=1220] Everybody raise your hand if you go to work somewhere.
[time=1222] Everybody raise your hand if you go to work somewhere, including your home.
[time=1226] Raise your hand.
[time=1227] There you go.
[time=1228] Awesome.
[time=1229] So it applies to several of us this morning.
[time=1231] Here are some challenges.
[time=1232] Here are some challenges that I think we've bumped into over the years.
[time=1235] Challenge number one, as it relates to being a priest at work, it's going to come on the screen.
[time=1240] Too many Christ followers on the job give more thought to how they're going to witness,
[time=1247] rather than to how hard they're going to work.
[time=1251] We have to be reminded periodically, my friends, that work is about, and then listen, God never takes these two and separates them.
[time=1258] He always brings a balance, but we have to understand that when it comes to work, while there will be a chance for you to live out your faith, yes.
[time=1266] While there will be a chance for you to, even at times maybe articulate that faith, we have to understand as Christ followers that when we go to work, it's time to what?
[time=1276] Work.
[time=1277] And God's Word is really clear that He wants us to work well and diligently and faithfully.
[time=1284] Challenge number two.
[time=1286] Too many of us think that our calling as employees is to debate or defend the truth, with those pagans at work.
[time=1295] You know, we go with kind of a mentality to argue, kind of complain and argue.
[time=1300] When Philippians 2, 14 says, "In everything except evangelism, do without complaint." No.
[time=1306] In everything, do it without complaining or arguing.
[time=1310] So we're not probably going to debate or argue people into the kingdom of God, and too often we see work as a place to do that.
[time=1317] Too many Christians, third challenge, we came up with.
[time=1320] Too many Christians are so heavenly-minded at work.
[time=1324] They're no earthly good to the organization.
[time=1327] And I want to make sure you hear us on this.
[time=1329] We're all for you and I being heavenly-minded.
[time=1332] The Scriptures call us to set our minds and to set our thoughts and to set our affections on that which is eternal.
[time=1338] It's a good thing to be heavenly-minded.
[time=1341] But again, while being heavenly-minded, we're also clearly called by Scripture to go into the marketplace, whatever that marketplace might be, and fulfill our responsibility to help that organization, to help that company, to help that individual do well.
[time=1356] We need to, while doing well with our heavenly mindset, be absolutely about the task at hand.
[time=1364] A balance that must be struck in a willingness on you and I to be workers, to be employees that do a very, very good job.
[time=1372] Now, some challenges, therefore, employees, there's also, I think, a major challenge that a lot of you employers face.
[time=1381] And Mitch is going to tell you about that.
[time=1383] Too many employers claiming to follow Christ's worship one way on Sunday
[time=1389] and then work another way on Monday.
[time=1392] How many people can think of somebody like that?
[time=1395] Raise your hand.
[time=1396] See, for a lot of us, it's who you are.
[time=1398] You know what I mean?
[time=1399] It's convicting because you got to think about that.
[time=1402] You got to think about that.
[time=1404] We worship one way on Sunday and then work another way on Monday.
[time=1407] God's never designed it at all to be that way.
[time=1411] And we look at this and there's a common thread.
[time=1414] The common thread was true in Ephesus and we're going to see what Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus 2000 years ago and it's true today.
[time=1423] We want to lead or specifically work by position.
[time=1430] We want position over another way.
[time=1433] The Bible calls it "lording it over another." But God's design, God's design that we lead or we work by permission,
[time=1445] by mutual submission, by mutual submission.
[time=1450] That literally we make ourselves lower than, that we, by permission,
[time=1456] lift up the other party.
[time=1459] Whether he's the employer or the employee.
[time=1462] Kelly and I were at a basketball game last night at Bethany Christian where the Lakewood Park Christian School Boys Basketball Team were defeated
[time=1472] by the Black Hawk Christian School Boys Basketball Team and the Black Hawk Christian School Braves have now won their fifth consecutive sectional.
[time=1482] If you're here and you're on the team, you want to stand up and coach?
[time=1485] You want to stand up? Congratulations.
[time=1487] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1496] We're going to talk about it later, but those of you, how many people were there?
[time=1499] Raise your hand if you were there. Oh, yeah.
[time=1501] What we saw was an act of worship and we're going to talk about that.
[time=1505] Let me tell you what coach teaches and what good coaches teach.
[time=1509] You know what happens to kind of illustrate the problem is when a ball is shot, at least eight guys are going to fight for position for the rebound.
[time=1519] Because getting the ball is the definition of success, right?
[time=1524] Maybe one guy's going to go back to fly on the fast break, another guy's going to go back and defend the basket, and probably eight guys are going to fight for position.
[time=1532] Well, in basketball, left to ourselves without good coaches, like Coach Merrill, what we will do and probably coach yells and screams at you, "Oh, he probably says it nicely. I'm sorry. He probably says it nicely." You know, we want to do this. We think... You six-seven?
[time=1547] Six-seven. Six-seven. NIT champion.
[time=1550] Are you five-seven? What are you?
[time=1551] That makes me so mad. Five-eleven?
[time=1554] I was listed at six foot because I was five-eleven and three-quarters in my tennis shoes and I had a little bit of a Buffon. Nice. Very nice.
[time=1564] All right, so here's what somebody like me wants to...
[time=1567] By nature, I'll go up to Kelly and I want to lead or work by position.
[time=1571] And so I'm up here like this. I'm up here at least trying to box him out and he just kind of tosses me aside because he's got a leverage, a lot of leverage up there at six-seven.
[time=1579] Whereas Coach would teach and Coach Robinson would teach this.
[time=1584] We get down here where we make every man the same size.
[time=1588] I make contact below the knee and here's the lesson.
[time=1593] Low man wins.
[time=1597] This is the lesson today. We were not designed to lead by lording it over,
[time=1604] to work by lording it over and seek position.
[time=1608] We were designed to lead and to work by permission making ourselves lower than the other guy
[time=1616] on whatever side of the coin you're on. Mutual submission. Low man wins.
[time=1624] Now we're going to lift this text from a context that's seen all through Ephesians 5.21.
[time=1631] And Ephesians 5.21 says this.
[time=1636] Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[time=1643] Submit to one another, NIV says, out of reverence for Christ.
[time=1648] Translated in the new new living translation, low man wins.
[time=1654] God's designed the way we engage with other people, that we make ourselves lower than mutual submission.
[time=1662] And it was a problem in Ephesus.
[time=1665] 2,000 years ago, Ephesus was the city of about 250,000 people was on a port.
[time=1672] It was a capital of Asia Minor.
[time=1674] And there was hustle and bustle. It was the wealthiest city in the wealthiest region of the Roman Empire.
[time=1680] Only two cities were bigger in population.
[time=1683] It was known as full of pagan religion.
[time=1690] But there was one that was bigger than all the rest.
[time=1694] And it was the worship of the goddess Artemis.
[time=1698] Even there was a temple called the Temple of Artemis.
[time=1703] It was one of the seven wonders of the world.
[time=1706] What they would do is they would make and earn money from making the silver shrines of Artemis.
[time=1716] And so basically the way of the world in Ephesus was seek position.
[time=1723] Lorded over.
[time=1724] We saw it with the religious.
[time=1725] Paul went to Ephesus on his third missionary journey and we look in Acts 19.
[time=1729] And we see that even the Jews would tend to be religious and lorded over.
[time=1734] It's Acts 19 verses 9 and 10.
[time=1737] Verses 9 and 10, Acts 19 verses 9 and 10.
[time=1739] But when I box you out my microphone fell down.
[time=1741] Yeah, that was good contact.
[time=1743] That was.
[time=1744] But when someone, I'm sorry, but when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, when they were lording it over, when they were trying to do it by position, speaking evil of the way before the people.
[time=1753] This is when Paul was in the synagogues.
[time=1755] He withdrew from them and took away the disciples reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
[time=1759] This took place for two years.
[time=1761] For two years.
[time=1763] So that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord both Jews and Greeks.
[time=1767] So Jews in the synagogues started to load over their position.
[time=1770] It happened with the licentious, the Artemis worshippers.
[time=1774] Acts 19 verses 24 through 28.
[time=1777] Just real quickly I'll show you how it worked with them.
[time=1779] For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen.
[time=1787] These he gathered together with the workmen of similar trades and said men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business.
[time=1795] You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul is persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people saying that God's made with hands or no gods at all.
[time=1805] Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disreview, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless, and that she whom all the Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.
[time=1820] When they heard this and were filled with rage, just like at a basketball game, they began crying out for the home team.
[time=1826] Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.
[time=1829] I was thinking, fast forward 2,000 years, and what's the silver shrine in our pockets
[time=1838] and in our purses and you know in our account?
[time=1841] What is that silver shrine that we tend to worship at work?
[time=1847] Money.
[time=1849] Nothing's changed.
[time=1853] And the message today is low man wins, low man wins.
[time=1857] So how to be a priest at work, we're going to take a look at Ephesians 6 verses 5-9.
[time=1862] Here we go.
[time=1863] Slaves be verse 5, Ephesians 6-5 through 9.
[time=1867] Slaves be obedient to those who are your masters.
[time=1870] Here we see the phrases slaves and masters in the text being interchangeably used
[time=1876] with the idea of employees and employers.
[time=1878] Same concept, same idea in that day.
[time=1881] Slaves be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh.
[time=1885] With fear and trembling.
[time=1887] In the sincerity of your heart as to Christ.
[time=1891] Not by way of eye service as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ doing the will of God
[time=1898] from the heart.
[time=1900] With good will, render service as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.
[time=1911] And masters, employers, shift leaders, managers, coaches, anybody who's got somebody reporting
[time=1921] to you, do the same thing to them and give up threatening, knowing that both their master
[time=1930] and yours is in heaven and there is no partiality with him.
[time=1935] And so the text here this morning kind of divides neatly into two parts.
[time=1938] We want to talk first of all this morning.
[time=1940] We want to get you thinking about what it means to be a priest at work.
[time=1945] Employee priests at work.
[time=1948] And let me take you back to verse five.
[time=1950] It says there, first sentence slaves or employees, be obedient to those who are your masters.
[time=1957] You can write this down, my friends.
[time=1958] Here you go.
[time=1959] First of all, raise your hand if you can just right now picture in your mind.
[time=1963] Raise your hand if you're picturing in your mind the individual whom you report to each and every day.
[time=1969] Go ahead.
[time=1970] Picture that person.
[time=1971] Everybody got a picture.
[time=1972] All right, good.
[time=1973] We all got somebody in mind.
[time=1974] It says here, obey the boss.
[time=1978] That's what it says.
[time=1979] It says that you and I are to obey the boss.
[time=1982] The Greek word here for obey is a word that means continuous uninterrupted submission.
[time=1988] I'll say that again, continuous, uninterrupted submission to one's earthly master or employer.
[time=1996] This means that actually with only one exception.
[time=2001] The one exception here is when that earthly master, when that employer, when that leader
[time=2007] commands or demands you to do something that would violate God's truth.
[time=2013] Something that would violate Scripture, something that would violate your commitment to represent
[time=2019] your God as a priest.
[time=2020] When we're talking about biblical mandate being violated, then you and I have the opportunity
[time=2026] to stand on our faith and to try as best we can to move in a different direction.
[time=2032] Other than that, we are to function on the job in a way that seeks to, each and every
[time=2038] time, do the job we've been asked to do.
[time=2042] Whatever the employer says, we are to continuously comply with and obey.
[time=2048] Here's where it gets interesting.
[time=2050] I see this all the time.
[time=2052] I see it in the ministry setting.
[time=2054] I see it in the marketplace.
[time=2055] Anytime we've got people working for somebody, I see this.
[time=2059] I see people who are working for someone.
[time=2061] I see it especially with believers who say, I'll do what he or she says.
[time=2065] I'd be happy to comply and I'll do it because he or she's a nice guy, nice gal.
[time=2071] They treat me nice, they're respectful.
[time=2074] But then you get the employer, then you get the leader who's the jerk, who doesn't ask nicely, who doesn't treat you fairly, and all of a sudden this obey the boss can begin
[time=2085] to be conditional.
[time=2088] And God never intended it.
[time=2090] You'll see it here this morning.
[time=2091] God never intended that.
[time=2094] The guy of violating God's word, he never intended your willingness to obey him or her
[time=2100] to be conditional.
[time=2103] Look what it says.
[time=2105] Be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling.
[time=2110] Mark that.
[time=2111] Underline that with fear and trembling.
[time=2113] You might want to write next to that respectfully.
[time=2117] This fear and trembling statement here in the text, this is the same statement used in the Old Testament where we saw again and again and again the frequent biblical admonition to fear the Lord.
[time=2130] It is not a, it is not a be afraid of the Lord.
[time=2133] We know that we've talked about that where we see fear the Lord.
[time=2136] It's not be afraid of the Lord.
[time=2138] It's not pull back because you think you're going to get hit.
[time=2141] No, it is a deep reverential respect.
[time=2145] It's what Corbin talked about this morning.
[time=2147] It's a posturing of oneself underneath that's willing to come alongside and comply.
[time=2152] It's willing to come along and follow.
[time=2154] It's willing to come under in a reverent respect, initially, most importantly, in our case because
[time=2164] he's God on the job because it's your boss, period.
[time=2177] The same word used in 1 Peter 2, and I want you to turn there, 1 Peter 2 helps you and
[time=2184] I see again the great importance of how it is you and I would do this, the kind of spirit
[time=2190] we would do it with, especially when dealing with those, especially when dealing with those
[time=2197] who we might in our flesh feel as if they don't deserve it.
[time=2202] Look at 1 Peter 2, 18 servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect.
[time=2207] Not only to those who are good and gentle, don't forget Peter writes here to the entire Christian church at this time when Peter writes to the church, the church is under severe persecution under the dominant persecuting hand of Nero.
[time=2221] I mean, it was all going south.
[time=2223] I mean, there was persecution and torment everywhere at the time Peter writes to the church and he says, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
[time=2234] Then look at verse 19.
[time=2236] Verse 19 says, "For this, find when you do this, when this is your posture, when this
[time=2242] is your response to the boss at work who doesn't treat you kindly, who makes unreasonable
[time=2248] demands on your life and on your time," he says, "this when you respond with a godly
[time=2254] fashion, this finds favor.
[time=2258] If for the sake of conscience toward God, a person bears up and endures under sorrows
[time=2266] when suffering unjustly.
[time=2269] There are sorrows, you do suffer, it is unjust, the text is clear.
[time=2275] Sometimes we get taken advantage of and the Scripture says to you and I today, as priests at work bear up, obey, respectfully obey, even sincerely obey."
[time=2292] Look at verse 6 back in Ephesians, it says, "In the sincerity of your heart as to Christ
[time=2298] into verse 5, verse 6, not by way of eye service as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ
[time=2306] doing the will of God from the what," say it out loud.
[time=2310] From the heart.
[time=2311] Look at Colossians 3, turn your Bibles to Colossians 3, Colossians 3, 22, Colossians
[time=2317] 3, 22, 23, and 24, I just want you to circle this, write this down.
[time=2322] Look at this again this afternoon or tonight, look at it tomorrow morning before you set foot back in the cubicle, Colossians 3, 22, slaves, employees, in all things, obey those
[time=2334] who are your masters on earth, not with external service as those who merely please men.
[time=2342] It's not like you're going to go in there and just say, "Okay, I'm going to get through this day and just get the job done." No, not just with external service, there's so much more at stake, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord, verse 23 says, "Whatever you do, do your work heartily.
[time=2359] Whether you teach, whether you coach, whether you're down at the city county building, whether you're here at Black Hawk Ministries, wherever it is you go and punch in." He says, "Do it heartily as for the Lord rather than for men," knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance.
[time=2376] It is the Lord Christ whom you serve, back in Ephesians 5, 6, it said, "No, I service.
[time=2383] Don't do it with I service." What's that mean?
[time=2386] That phrase there means not just, and you've seen folks like this, maybe this has been you before, I know it's been me in the past, I service is what takes place when you work really hard and you're really diligent because the boss is what?
[time=2400] Looking.
[time=2401] Yes, the boss is watching, so you get busy and you do your job and then the boss walks away and down you sit, not with I service or men pleasing, working only.
[time=2412] This is very important, you guys, very important that we understand this.
[time=2416] Men pleasing, they're in verse 6.
[time=2419] You see it there?
[time=2420] Not by way of I service as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ.
[time=2426] This men pleasing phrase has to do with what we're working for.
[time=2430] It really asks the most important and central question, "Why do you go to work?" Men pleasing is when we work only to promote one's own welfare or profit.
[time=2441] And this cuts right to the central issue here.
[time=2444] So many times we're about going to work for the check.
[time=2449] So many times we get to thinking that we're going to work to make money.
[time=2453] So many times we think we're going to work to support a family.
[time=2456] So many times we're going to work to help pay for school.
[time=2459] Is there anything wrong with any of the above?
[time=2462] Yes or no?
[time=2463] No.
[time=2464] It is not.
[time=2465] The scriptures teach us and show us this morning.
[time=2467] It is not the central fundamental issue.
[time=2471] It is not the primary motivation.
[time=2474] You and I should be going to work according to scripture to honor our employer and serve
[time=2480] Christ faithfully through diligent, obedient, respectful service.
[time=2488] Service to our king and service to the boss.
[time=2492] What concept?
[time=2494] Serving the boss.
[time=2495] It's right here in our passage.
[time=2497] Mitchell's going to show you a little bit about that.
[time=2499] Verses 7 and 8, "With good will render service or serve as to the Lord and not to men."
[time=2505] That doesn't mean that you don't serve men.
[time=2508] It means you serve them as if you're serving the Lord.
[time=2511] Knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive back from the Lord, whether
[time=2517] slave or free.
[time=2519] Slavery free is a big thing because a third of the population were slaves.
[time=2525] We picture slavery of the 1800s here in the United States.
[time=2530] Slavery there could look like that but it wasn't primarily based on being a minority.
[time=2535] You might have been a region that Rome conquered and you were a doctor.
[time=2541] You were still a doctor but you were a slave.
[time=2544] You lost your free citizenship.
[time=2547] You were a slave but you still went about your ways of doing things.
[time=2551] In fact, some people saw slavery as a ticket to success and they'd want to be that because
[time=2557] some slaves had really great positions of authority and they could earn assets after having none by being in a position with a master who worked it out with them and gave them incentive.
[time=2569] It could be bad, like Kelly talked, it could be unreasonable and it could be reasonable.
[time=2575] It's really a direct tie to an employee serving an employer and serving the customer as well.
[time=2587] It's because Paul modeled what Christ did.
[time=2592] Paul served when he was in Ephesus.
[time=2595] Look what he says in Acts 20.
[time=2596] This is verses 18 through 21 and when they had come to him, he said to them, "You know
[time=2603] yourselves know from the first day that I set foot in Asia in Ephesus how I was with you the whole time." Serving the Lord with all humility, low man wins and with tears and with trials which
[time=2616] came upon me through the plots of the Jews.
[time=2619] How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable and teaching you publicly and from house to house, solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance
[time=2630] toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2634] He came to serve the people.
[time=2637] Jesus served.
[time=2638] Kelly mentioned it last week.
[time=2640] What theologians think in the theme verses of Mark, it's Mark 10 verses 42 through 45.
[time=2647] Let's take a look at that.
[time=2649] Mark 10 verses 42 through 45.
[time=2651] Again, we talked about this position is lording it over.
[time=2656] The Bible refers to it again and again is lording it over.
[time=2659] James and John and the disciples are kind of working for position and they want positional
[time=2665] authority.
[time=2666] They want the big man to win.
[time=2669] And Jesus calling them to himself said, "You know what those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles, they lord it over them.
[time=2675] They do the position thing and their great man exercise authority over them." But it's not this way among you, among you, low man wins.
[time=2685] But whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant.
[time=2691] And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all.
[time=2697] For even Jesus, even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.
[time=2706] Submit in Ephesians 5-21, obey in this passage, slave, servant, all cousins in words all about
[time=2718] making yourself lower than.
[time=2721] All about mutual submission by choice.
[time=2726] We encountered a lot of fast food this last week because between here and Goshen, at least from my house in Goshen, that's about your only choice to eat.
[time=2733] To the sectional was.
[time=2735] The sectional was in Goshen.
[time=2736] So fast food.
[time=2739] How many people have been through a drive-through or in a fast food restaurant in the last couple of weeks?
[time=2743] Raise your hand.
[time=2744] Yeah, there you go.
[time=2745] Just as God intended.
[time=2746] You know?
[time=2747] I this week was old for five at fast food restaurants on the order being right.
[time=2753] Old for five.
[time=2754] Now I do ask, I do ask for some special things.
[time=2759] I won't say a thing.
[time=2760] Okay.
[time=2762] Let me tell you, when you get somebody at a fast food restaurant who serves, oh my goodness.
[time=2771] You start asking that person about himself or herself, you're drawn to that person.
[time=2776] I mean, we had one the other night.
[time=2777] He had one the other night.
[time=2778] I got to think it.
[time=2779] I got a car full of ketchup attics.
[time=2781] So I got a define, you know, the quantity of ketchup that I need.
[time=2783] What might-- Can't you say a few extra ketchup-- No, it doesn't happen.
[time=2786] Then I hear it from everybody else in the car.
[time=2787] So what happens is this guy said, Susan leans over because she's always afraid I'm not going
[time=2793] to get enough ketchup.
[time=2794] And she says it again.
[time=2795] And the guy responds like this.
[time=2796] He goes, look in the bag, man, I'm telling you, the guy had to put the whole box of ketchup packs in there.
[time=2802] Very nice.
[time=2803] You had one at Arby's.
[time=2804] Right.
[time=2805] I asked for one of the kids, one of the junior Arby's with cheese, but they didn't want the sesame seed bun that they saw in the picture.
[time=2811] So I was going to ask the guy for a non-sesame seed bun and I said, hey, I said, would it be possible for me to-- and he cut me off, and all of a sudden this voice comes out of the box.
[time=2820] No problem.
[time=2821] Absolutely.
[time=2822] Happy to do it.
[time=2823] And I didn't even finish the request, and he's already offering the great service, which meant a lot.
[time=2828] I wanted to just hug him.
[time=2829] I told him he was the Arby's mitten.
[time=2833] I said, he was the boy.
[time=2835] He was the Arby's poster.
[time=2836] He was the Arby's poster boy, man.
[time=2839] That's right.
[time=2840] See what that does?
[time=2841] The employee of the year.
[time=2842] Two guys giddy over fast food servants.
[time=2846] I mean, think about that.
[time=2847] What would happen if you this week would think low man wins, and you would choose to look
[time=2853] for needs and meet them and serve, serve the employer, serve the customer?
[time=2860] Yeah.
[time=2862] You know, Dwight Robertson founded Kingdom Building Ministries, just wrote a book called Plan A, and there is no Plan B.
[time=2870] He says this, what we're talking about today, is God's Plan A for the advancement of the Kingdom of God.
[time=2875] It's true.
[time=2876] And there is no Plan B?
[time=2877] You know, a kid, just real quick, a kid got hurt, a liquid kid got hurt last night
[time=2883] towards A.C.L.
[time=2885] U.
[time=2886] Just A.C.L.
[time=2887] Taurus, A.C.L.
[time=2890] And an orthopod, I did that for fun.
[time=2894] I couldn't help it.
[time=2895] But Susie did it for real last night?
[time=2896] I don't know.
[time=2897] But an orthopod is on the other side, an orthopedic guy, doctor, is on the black oxide.
[time=2904] We didn't have one on the liquid side, and the host school, I don't think, had one.
[time=2908] And so he comes over and he determines, rather quickly, that the senior, great athlete going
[time=2915] to play soccer at Huntington is done for the next six months, and we'll have to have surgery.
[time=2922] And I've got to tell you something.
[time=2924] At that moment, I doubt that 1 of 1,000 people watching that were concerned about Doc coming
[time=2934] over and handing him a tract or speaking to him words of, "Do you want to get safe?"
[time=2947] What everybody was thinking about was, "Is he a good doctor?
[time=2951] Can he help him?
[time=2952] Can he meet the need?
[time=2953] Can he serve the customer?" And I'm telling you, everywhere you go, when you work, that's what's going on on the other side.
[time=2960] And it's ludicrous to think we're going to advance the kingdom of God and not serve.
[time=2964] This week, Lowman wins.
[time=2966] Absolutely.
[time=2967] And Lowman wins on both sides of this equation.
[time=2972] Watch this.
[time=2973] This is just really, really powerful how the passage progresses, because now having talked about the employee, now he talks about the employer.
[time=2983] Think about it.
[time=2984] You in the room who are employers, you people in the room who have people who report to you.
[time=2991] You in the room who, again, shift managers, owners of companies, large or small, anybody
[time=2997] here, and you've got people in a sense underneath you who you're responsible for.
[time=3003] He says to you, having said all of that, having said to the employees, obey the boss, having
[time=3009] said to the employees with fear and trembling, with great respect, having said to the employees,
[time=3015] do it with great sincerity, employees, as unto Christ.
[time=3020] Now look with me at verse 9.
[time=3022] This is so good.
[time=3023] He says, "And masters, everybody in the room now, read out loud the next four words.
[time=3028] Ready go.
[time=3029] Do the same things." It just, it shatters this kind of corporate myth.
[time=3040] It shatters this picture of you getting to be the boss, and you get to tell them how to do it, and you get to make the demands, and you get to be up here, and they get to be down here." He says, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no." He says, "Do the same thing."
[time=3058] Come alongside him.
[time=3060] Be respectful in kind.
[time=3063] Serve the employee.
[time=3064] You might want to write that down, if you're here today and you own a company, if you're here today and people report to you, serve the employee.
[time=3073] With employers, listen, with employers who know the Lord, the workplace, and one's spiritual
[time=3080] life are not detached or separated.
[time=3085] I can't tell you how many times I get concerned by this.
[time=3090] It's as if people walk out of this room on Sunday, and they go into an office on Monday, and some switch gets flipped, and it's like Jekyll and Hyde.
[time=3101] And it's like, I think you think you know the person.
[time=3104] You think you kind of know who they are and what they're like, but then you get a glimpse of them with the employees, and it's not good.
[time=3116] Your spiritual life and your workplace manner completely and absolutely are to be integrated,
[time=3126] and this is an opportunity for you to serve.
[time=3128] The way you treat, the way you handle employees is uniquely and absolutely tied to the faith
[time=3135] that you profess to embrace.
[time=3137] Do the same things.
[time=3140] Read the passage, be respectful to each and every employee, be kind, be clear and straightforward
[time=3149] with expectations, and don't hesitate to call employees to accountability as it relates
[time=3155] to those expectations, but do it with kindness and goodness and sincerity of heart.
[time=3161] Be, here you go, just be nice.
[time=3166] You can be a good boss.
[time=3168] You can run a great company.
[time=3170] You can make huge inroads into whatever market you're trying.
[time=3174] You can do a great job as a leader in the marketplace, and you can be really, really nice to people who work hard for you, and when they don't, you can lovingly and straightforwardly
[time=3185] challenge them.
[time=3188] Do it without the attitude.
[time=3189] Look at the text, "Stop Threatening." You see it there?
[time=3193] Verse 9, "Stop Threatening." Keep up threatening, the phrase basically refers to a heavy-handed, critical, negative approach.
[time=3207] My friends, this means that the spirit-filled priest, the spirit-filled priest who's an
[time=3213] employer, the spirit-filled priest who's leading on the job, running point, you already use
[time=3221] your authority, and you are to exercise the power you've been given with grace and great
[time=3227] justice.
[time=3230] Don't threaten.
[time=3232] Don't speak or act abusively.
[time=3235] Don't be inconsiderate.
[time=3237] The text says, "Do the same things.
[time=3240] Lead respectfully, lead with sincerity, serve your people." Some of the greatest...
[time=3246] Some of the greatest...I've been in ministry now for over 20 years, and in those 20 years
[time=3253] have had the privilege of having a...no pun intended, a bird's-eye view.
[time=3259] I've had the chance to come alongside...I didn't mean for you to laugh.
[time=3263] Sorry.
[time=3264] It just came to my mind.
[time=3266] I've had the privilege of having a vantage point with certain men and women in the marketplace
[time=3273] who lead some in small businesses, some in very large businesses.
[time=3278] I've had the privilege of seeing Christ followers, priests, who are employers, and some of the
[time=3286] best ones that I've ever seen are the ones who walk through the hallways of their organization,
[time=3296] literally asking again and again one question.
[time=3301] What can I do for you?
[time=3303] How can I help you?
[time=3306] How can I come alongside and help you personally?
[time=3309] How can I come alongside and help you do better at what we're doing?
[time=3312] How can I serve you?
[time=3315] Employers.
[time=3316] Do the same things.
[time=3320] And obey because your master and theirs is the same.
[time=3323] In to verse 9.
[time=3325] Both their master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.
[time=3330] It's a level playing field.
[time=3332] Master and Lord, same word.
[time=3335] You know, Paul modeled this, Paul obeyed God.
[time=3338] Paul was an employer.
[time=3339] Paul would go and work as a tent maker, a leather worker, and earn money and took care of the guys traveling with him so he wouldn't be a burden.
[time=3347] It's just real simple here.
[time=3348] We'll look at it quickly.
[time=3349] Acts 20 verses 33 through 35.
[time=3351] Look what he said to the guys in heaven says, "I have coveted no one silver." Remember Artemis?
[time=3355] "I've coveted no one silver, gold, or clothes.
[time=3358] Do yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me." There it is.
[time=3364] "In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner, you must help the weak employees.
[time=3370] And remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said is more blessed to give than
[time=3378] to receive." I'm going to close with this.
[time=3381] At the game last night, we talked about it, fans talked about it afterwards on both sides.
[time=3387] We were drawn.
[time=3389] We were drawn to both teams on what we saw.
[time=3393] And one of the things I like to watch closely outside of the performance and the character that's displayed on the court is what happens afterwards in that congratulatory line.
[time=3402] Because my background has been a lot of things can happen.
[time=3405] There could be some profanity with girls, it tends to be this.
[time=3408] They ignore a good game, good game, you know, do that kind of thing.
[time=3411] But I'm telling you, you got to listen to this.
[time=3413] Last night I watched that.
[time=3416] I watched you guys, and I watched the Lakewood guys.
[time=3421] And to a man and to a coach, every single one, hand on the shoulder, hand out, locking
[time=3428] eyes, good game, good game.
[time=3432] And as you got closer to guys who actually had played with each other in the summertime and had a closer relationship, there might be a little hug, you know, go in regional.
[time=3442] And then you got to coach Merrill and coach Davis, coach Merrill's invested in coach Davis at Lakewood.
[time=3447] And there's an embrace and a hug and there are tears on both sides.
[time=3452] You know, go get them in regional.
[time=3455] Here's my point.
[time=3457] Every man who had a jersey on that night was led by an employer, say, a coach, a master,
[time=3464] who obeys God.
[time=3466] And every one of those kids have been taught to do what we're asking you to do today, no man wins, serve, serve and obey.
[time=3476] Go ahead and stand and we're going to pray.
[time=3480] If you're an employee, if you're an employee, we want you to honor, obey respectfully and
[time=3488] sincerely the employer this week, earn the right to be heard, serve, meet and need.
[time=3497] And if you're the employer, if you're the coach, if you're the master, if you've got people that you're leading, do the same things, serve those guys, obey God because of low
[time=3508] man wins.
[time=3511] God may it be so.
[time=3512] May we live a life of mutual submission in all relationships and God at work.
[time=3517] May we be priests.
[time=3518] May we be co-hans.
[time=3519] May we connect with you in a way that we can connect with others so that they connect
[time=3525] with you.
[time=3526] We praise you for who you are, our high priest, in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3556] We praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high
[time=3573] are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise
[time=3579] you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you are, our high priest, and we praise you for who you
[time=3614] You
