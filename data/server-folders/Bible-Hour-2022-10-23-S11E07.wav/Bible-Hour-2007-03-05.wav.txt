[time=30] Hi, I'm Sam Barfell, and I serve as a superintendent of what I think to be one of the best Christian
[time=51] schools in the state of Indiana, right here at Black Art Christian School in northeast Fort Wayne. And I'm talking to you today because I want to invite you to consider and explore the possibility of having your child become a student at Black Art Christian School for the 07/08 school year. This is the point of the school year where we've begun what we call our re-enrollment cycle. And we've given our current families that first opportunity to get their students re-enrolled for next year. And now we're at that point where we're opening up our enrollment and our registration for new families in our community who have not been a part of Black Art Christian School. And that's why I would like to warmly invite you to explore that as a possibility for your family. Also, there's several new and exciting programs for next year, which I am very thankful for. First of all, in our preschool program, we have a three, four, and five-year-old preschool, and we've expanded that, and we now will be offering four-day-a-week program with afternoon classes as well. In addition to that, another
[time=106] new program next year is our full-day kindergarten option. For our 35 years of history, we have always had a half-day program in kindergarten. And next year, we're happy to say that we're
[time=117] creating a new full-day kindergarten option. And already, there are many families who have indicated their desire to have their five-year-old child be a part of our full-day and half-day
[time=127] kindergarten. So if you are interested in the possibility of being part of the Black Ock Christian School community, I invite you to visit our website at blackawkchristian.org.
[time=136] And all the information is there that you need with the pricing structure and information about all of our programs, preschool, elementary, junior high, and high school.
[time=144] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=157] and on earth. Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of
[time=168] the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=179] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=185] the end of the age.
[time=190] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=215] Deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond a measure, that He should give His
[time=237] only Son, to make a wretched treasure, how great the pain of searing us, the Father turns
[time=254] His face away, as wounds which more than chosen are, bring many sons to glory.
[time=266] Behold the man upon the cross, my sin upon his shoulders, a shamed, I hear my mocking
[time=294] voice, call out among the scoffers, it was my sin that held in there, until it was accomplished
[time=311] His diamond has taught me that I know that it is finished.
[time=334] I will not boast in anything, no gifts, no power, no wisdom, but I will boast in Jesus
[time=349] Christ, His death and resurrection, why should I gain from His reward, I can not give an
[time=365] answer, but this I know with all my heart, His rules have paid my ransom, why should I
[time=379] gain from His reward, I can not give an answer, but this I know with all my heart, His rules
[time=397] are my ransom.
[time=407] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I want to welcome
[time=414] you to our broadcast.
[time=416] You know at Blackhawk these days, we are so looking forward to a date that is quickly approaching.
[time=421] We've said it before around here.
[time=423] We think it is the most significant day of the year, and it is a day that we so look forward to celebrating that day as Easter, coming up on April 8th.
[time=433] With Easter approaching, with good Friday coming, and with there being so much significance spiritually to what took place on those days and with those events, we wanted to just kind of try and put aside some time where we could as a family and where you could, even as our
[time=449] extended family, come and join us.
[time=451] And with spring break now bumping up against Easter this year, we've kind of backed it
[time=457] up a bit and picked a night the 25th of March.
[time=460] And I want you to write that down, the 25th of March is Sunday evening at 6.
[time=465] And here's what we're going to do, we've gotten permission to show in a public setting
[time=471] the movie The Passion of the Christ, that's right.
[time=474] The Passion of the Christ, many of you may have seen that movie a few years ago, but for many of us it's been a while since we watched it, and it is such a powerful and dramatic representation of what took place as Christ gives his life so that you and I could be
[time=489] redeemed.
[time=490] And we're just going to invite you to come, bring your friends, bring your family.
[time=493] You may have a home church, no big deal, you can still come, you may not have a church, we'd love to meet you, but bring some friends and bring some family and come join us at 6 p.m. on Sunday night the 25th for a viewing of The Passion of the Christ and then a communion
[time=506] service following, we'd love to have you with us.
[time=509] Hey, what you're going to see this morning here on the broadcast is what took place this last Sunday, it was a very special morning as we set aside time to dedicate moms and dads
[time=519] and their little ones, we call it parent baby dedication.
[time=523] It's a great, great opportunity for us as a family here at Blackhawk to celebrate the new life that God has provided, to set aside literally to dedicate these parents to all
[time=534] that lies ahead for them and to thank God for these little lives.
[time=539] As a part of that morning we showed a video and I want you to see the video now, it is a couple who dedicated their little girl Maggie that morning and we just want you to
[time=549] hear their story.
[time=550] We know Mike and Bethany Collins from the years that God has allowed us to spend with them
[time=556] here at Blackhawk, they have an amazing story and we want you to hear that following the video, you'll then hear from a gal in our church, a wonderful lady, Sherry Marisie who
[time=566] is the mother of seven and is just a wise, sweet, dear woman who came that morning and
[time=574] shared with our audience and our parents just some words of wisdom, so you'll enjoy those words as well.
[time=581] I'm Mike Collins, this is my wife Bethany, this is our daughter Margaret Joy, we call her
[time=587] Maggie.
[time=588] But actually our second child, we had a son, Chase, I was born on November 1st of 2004,
[time=596] he was kind of a long pregnancy in some ways just because we had some medical complications,
[time=604] Bethany's water actually broke at four months and she was in the hospital on bed rest for
[time=610] two months before Chase was born.
[time=614] The whole time in the hospital we had doctors saying that there was little to no chance that Chase would even survive and that kind of recommendation from them was to just terminate
[time=627] the pregnancy and just kind of take some stress off of us and move on.
[time=634] For us that really wasn't an option, we didn't feel like it was our decision to end the pregnancy.
[time=641] Chase was born and he did have some major complications, just underdeveloped lungs and
[time=647] I was in the NICU, right from the start we were told again that he wasn't going to make
[time=653] it.
[time=654] He was in the NICU for five months before he passed away.
[time=659] That whole experience, you can feel like the peace and just knowing that people are praying
[time=665] for us and lifting us up and you just kind of float along and the only way to explain it is peace because it is just so above anything we can understand.
[time=677] We had said that after Chase died we wanted at least a year to grieve and to kind of move
[time=684] on and that's what we were praying that God would just give us a year and a year to the
[time=691] month that Chase passed away we found that we were pregnant with many.
[time=695] So it's all God's timing and there's nothing we can do but trust and just know that he's
[time=704] going to get us through, he's going to bring us to the other side if we just follow Him.
[time=718] We're having her dedicated because in front of our friends and family we want to publicly commit to raising her in a Christian home.
[time=726] We hope that someday on her own she'll choose to have a relationship with Christ on her
[time=732] own and take it as her own and we just want to be held accountable so that's why we wanted
[time=739] to do it in front of everyone.
[time=740] Good morning my name's Sherry Marisi, some of you that don't know me.
[time=745] I started attending Black Hawk in 1976 when I was a student nurse at Parkview, several
[time=753] of us student nurses came here and met my husband here and we were blessed with several
[time=759] seven children and this morning they've asked me just to give a few words of wisdom to the
[time=766] parents that are dedicating their children not because I'm a perfect mother I have perfect
[time=772] children or I know everything about parenting, I'm just willing to share a little bit of
[time=779] what God has taught us over the years and Mike and Bethany I want to thank you for your
[time=788] video, it was an encouragement to me along with the seven children that God has blessed
[time=794] us with in 1987 we also had a daughter Megan and because of some complications with her
[time=805] brain and her heart she only lived for four days and through that I can see how already
[time=816] Mike and Bethany that God has used your journey with your precious little son chase to help
[time=823] others and I pray that in the future over the next 20 years it's been 20 years since Megan
[time=831] died that God will be able to allow you to walk beside people who will be going through the same journey that you have went in the past few months and I thank you so much for
[time=843] your willingness to do that.
[time=847] When I was asked to think of a few things to say to you I came up with a list and it
[time=855] was a long, long list so I condensed it just a five short sentences and I kind of made
[time=866] it easier for people hopefully parenting and I have seven different piece so if you kind
[time=873] of might be able to remember that the first one I've been told by different people and
[time=883] also read that one of the most important things that you can do for your children is to love
[time=890] and respect your spouse or their mother and father so the first one would be parent with
[time=897] your partner with love and respect.
[time=902] The second one would be parent patiently, positively and persistently.
[time=913] It's not always easy at all but I think if you use those three things, positive patience
[time=921] and persistence in the long run that will be very good for your children and they will
[time=927] sense it.
[time=929] The third one is partner with power of the Holy Spirit because you can't do it on your
[time=937] own.
[time=939] Any of you that have children know that you do not know how to do things that I many times just like I don't know what to do you have to tell me and you know what he will he loves your children.
[time=951] God loves your children more than you possibly ever could and he will help you so partner with the power of the Holy Spirit and also preparation.
[time=961] We prepare for anything else.
[time=963] We prepare to cook.
[time=964] How many cookbooks do we have in our house?
[time=967] How many?
[time=968] How to fix things do you have in your house?
[time=971] How to play golf?
[time=972] How many times have you read a book or watched a video?
[time=976] So why wouldn't we want to prepare for our parenting?
[time=980] There's the scriptures, wise counsel of people in the church or your family, books.
[time=989] So try to partner with power of the Holy Spirit and preparation.
[time=997] Another one I think is really important is prayer.
[time=1005] I can't tell you how many times I pray for my kids.
[time=1010] When my husband was alive I wake up in the middle of the night and he would be sitting at the end of the bed praying for the kids and he had a little shelf with all the pictures and he would go down the row and actually look at their pictures and pray for them.
[time=1023] So I've tried to do that also.
[time=1026] I'm not as good about that as he was but when I drop him off at school and pick him up I'm always praying for them, when I walk during the day I pray for them and that's
[time=1037] an area that I just think is so important.
[time=1041] And like I've said before, God loves your children more than you possibly ever could.
[time=1046] So he wants to help you and just tell him that, hey I don't know what I'm doing, please help me and he will.
[time=1055] And the last one is, I couldn't really think of a P for this but parent with eternity or
[time=1062] paradise in mind, sometimes we get caught up in here and now like how many teams they
[time=1074] should be on like three or four soccer teams or such and such, sports are great and everything
[time=1080] else is great, you want them to be well rounded but think ultimately of the eternal value,
[time=1086] what do you want your children to learn and be and what is eternally valuable.
[time=1095] And I just know that that will be precious for them and the things that they learn and we just want to try to do that.
[time=1104] Hey I hope Mike and Bethany's story and the things that Sherry was able to share with you was encouraging to you.
[time=1111] I am thankful for the chance that we had that morning to then continue on in our current series.
[time=1117] As many of you know who have been watching, we find ourselves in the midst of what has been a several week discussion entitled "I'm a Priest" and we've been talking about the priesthood of all believers.
[time=1128] This amazing truth that God reveals to us in His Word that you and I, those of us that know the Lord, those of us that have fully surrendered our hearts and lives to Him.
[time=1137] He looks at us as priests, people who because of our relationship with Him have the opportunity
[time=1143] to not only draw close to Him but then to take that, take that relationship that we have
[time=1149] with Him in all that He's teaching us and showing us and then pass that on to those in our world.
[time=1155] It is our priestly function to represent God, to literally pass God along to others.
[time=1161] It's been a great discussion and on this past Sunday we talked about actually being priests at home in conjunction with this morning that was kind of set aside for our parents and
[time=1171] their little ones we talked about and my message has to do with being a priest at home.
[time=1176] And before you see the message, you're just going to see a quick drama that I think was a reminder to all of us and I hope you'll have fun with it.
[time=1183] That's what it was intended to do, just give you a little bit of fun and brevity.
[time=1188] It's just a reminder to you and I that while we're thankful that God has allowed some people to influence our children in places like children's ministry here at the church, there are probably
[time=1198] a few out there that we're really glad haven't influenced our kids.
[time=1204] Around here we would call those two Dan and Jan and they're back again and I hope you enjoy the drama.
[time=1211] Hello I am so very excited that you all volunteered to be a part of the new member-driven children's
[time=1218] ministry vision program.
[time=1220] Now to get started let's go around and say our names and why we decided to help out.
[time=1224] I'm Ted and I just love children.
[time=1227] Well I'm Rhonda.
[time=1229] Ted and I don't have any children of our own yet but we are just so delighted to be a part of shaping yours.
[time=1236] Like Ted I just love children.
[time=1239] I'm Lisa.
[time=1240] Rob and I have three kids here in the children's ministry so we thought it was time we probably went to hand.
[time=1249] I'm Rob and Lisa dragged me here.
[time=1251] Oh I'm sure you're just gonna love it once you dive right in.
[time=1255] And you?
[time=1257] Well I'm Dan and this is my love muffin, Jan.
[time=1263] Well we thought this was an opportunity to sign our son up for an eye exam.
[time=1267] I know how silly, how silly children's ministry vision program.
[time=1273] Anywho since we're already here we thought perhaps we could provide some insight.
[time=1278] You know we have been going to church now for 15 years.
[time=1284] 15 years now.
[time=1286] Well I can see how somebody could make such a mistake.
[time=1293] Nonetheless I'm so very glad you both are here.
[time=1296] You're just gonna love the new look of the children's ministry.
[time=1299] Now are there any ideas that anyone would like to volunteer for this coming year?
[time=1303] Well I think we can have some fun with the Old Testament.
[time=1305] I remember Bible stories from my childhood I just loved like a story of Moses to think
[time=1311] that his mother saved him by putting him in a basket and then setting a float so it would end up in Pharaoh's house.
[time=1317] That is a great idea.
[time=1319] In fact Rhonda why don't you go ahead and start charting some of these ideas.
[time=1322] So I love it and we could talk about how God punishes us when we disobey him.
[time=1326] Like Pharaoh and the seven plagues.
[time=1327] That's right that's right there was the plague of locusts and frogs and blood and boils and
[time=1333] rickets and all the bubonic plague and the ebonic plague.
[time=1339] That's right that's right and the Asian bird flu nasty nasty bug great opportunity to talk to the kids about personal hygiene.
[time=1346] That's right yeah oh and I love the story of Moses giving that sermon on Mount Sinai.
[time=1351] And he fed the entire nation of Israel with one golden calf one calf my dad what a genius.
[time=1360] Yeah great great ideas any other suggestions Lisa I love the story of Noah in the arc.
[time=1367] Oh that's right I love that story to you and how the Israelites they just carried that arc they carried it around those walls Jericho until they just fell down.
[time=1376] Fell down just like that wall the buildings everything everything except for the leaning tower of Babel which is still standing to this day.
[time=1383] Dan and I hope to see it if we ever visit the holy land.
[time=1387] Honey are you are you getting oh yep yeah great ideas just wonderful ideas keep them coming any other suggestions well there's always the story of the Prophet Jonah.
[time=1398] Oh Lisa I think you are onto something big.
[time=1400] Oh I love the story of Jonah and the great white shark.
[time=1404] Oh honey I think you met whale.
[time=1406] Wait what did I say you said shark that was cute though that was cute right whale call
[time=1414] me ish male honey you it seems that Jonah was sent out to preach to the nanny of vites
[time=1420] because they were warring with the 12 tribes of Israel.
[time=1424] No they weren't.
[time=1426] The city of Nineveh was to be destroyed because they were wicked and they needed to repent.
[time=1431] Right yeah but then that's when Jonah he jumped that wailing ship yeah he was trying
[time=1438] to cross the was it the Red Sea or the Dead Sea you know I'm just really not good with my geography I'm more of a numbers man.
[time=1444] That's right my dance and accountant.
[time=1446] That's right yeah but you know what Jonah he got seasick and was throwing up overboard
[time=1452] go what the world.
[time=1454] Well wait a minute I don't know wait wait he wasn't thrown overboard he wasn't throwing up he was thrown overboard oh right right right right right yeah thrown right overboard.
[time=1469] And and oh he was swallowed swallowed by the big whale then that's right that's what happened and then he was inside that whale for I don't know three days yeah and that's when captain
[time=1479] Ahab he had pulled him he had pulled that big fish that's right that's right that's right I think he confused Jonah with the story of Moby Dick.
[time=1493] You know the one written by Herman Melville Herman Melick that's right Yahoo incidentally
[time=1501] invented the food staple spam oh I just love spam I love spam too I have some of the best recipes for spam I have a recipe for spam low and spam ball and a spam and cheese order
[time=1513] and spam sticks and western spam okay let's let's let's get back on track here some wonderful
[time=1521] ideas thank you very much any other ideas well I guess we could explore topics in early
[time=1531] childhood training excellent what we feel here in children's ministry is that what we teach should just be an extension of the training you're already providing at home in fact that is the new focus of our child dedication process right we just love Dr. Gobson oh and as those
[time=1547] child wise theories oh Dr. Spock who said live long and prosper yeah let's try to think
[time=1554] of some biblical topics that we can impart to our little blessings well Rob and I do scripture memorization with our kids oh what a great idea we should find scripture to talk about child training that's wonderful you know Dan and I we like to focus on the BIBLE now that
[time=1570] that's the book for me for us honestly and here's a little gem just for you train up
[time=1578] a child in the way he should go so when he is old he will depart yeah or this one the
[time=1587] rod of correction imparts wisdom but a child left to himself will eventually burn a house down yes exactly exactly or this one even a child is known by his transactions especially
[time=1601] good if you're an accountant yeah a cotton sun yeah yeah oh what about the one do not hinder the children let them come to me before because the kingdom magic kingdom is for them that's right that's right or my personal favorite from the book of Genesis and the Lord
[time=1616] said unto the woman I will greatly increase your pains during child bearing with great pains you will give birth to children and your desire will be for your husband to do it the
[time=1627] next time ladies and gentlemen thank you for these wonderful suggestions I think we have enough to go to the pastoral staff so let's call it quits for today thank you sounds good to me but wait we have more to share we're that's right my Dan has some very interesting idea about body training what are we gonna get together again this morning we want to
[time=1648] talk about priests at home and we want to talk about this process that we've been kind of describing to you over the last several weeks where as a co-hon say Hebrew word for priest
[time=1659] as a co-hon everybody everybody on the wall there everybody who got their picture taken
[time=1665] all of you in the room this morning who would know him and have a desire to not just be in relationship with him but impact others you see as priests he allows us to as priests
[time=1675] draw near we've been learning that co-hon priest it means to draw near to God to get really really really close to God and having gotten close to God and having gotten God all over you so to speak having listened to him and having read his word and having talked
[time=1690] about his word with others and having worshiped him and having spent times of meditation having
[time=1696] drawn near you and I have the privilege then of spreading that communicating that representing
[time=1702] that truth to others we don't do it perfectly we we don't do it right all the time but there is this desire in us to be good priests those who mediate the divine and this morning I
[time=1714] want to remind you last week we talked about being priests at work well the response to that was just incredible there were people even asking that maybe we'd come back and do a Q&A on that on that on that topic alone and and we're gonna figure out a way to come back at you with that topic and provide some more insights and provide some more interaction but this morning I want to just talk to you briefly and I want it to be very very practical I want it to just be something that you can take with you this morning and move it right into our discussion this morning just take it right into the everyday of your life this afternoon tonight because my friends not only do you have a chance to be priests co-hons who who represent God in the marketplace not only do we have a chance to represent him in
[time=1758] the everyday of our lives we have the opportunity and privilege to be priests at home maybe maybe
[time=1766] one of the most important settings where you and I have the opportunity to be engaged
[time=1772] in this kind of endeavor by home yes I mean the building yes I mean the four walls and
[time=1778] the roof and all that but but I also mean I also mean we have the privilege of being priests with our families I mean let's just not lose sight of the great privilege that you and I have you and I who am I talking to this morning I'm talking to moms and dads many of you moms and dads in the room you have kids that are in the home you have some of
[time=1797] you kids who are out of the home some of you don't have kids yet some of you moms are on
[time=1803] your own some of your dads are on your own I'm talking about people who have a home I'm
[time=1811] talking about folks who have a family I'm talking about anybody in the room who gets the chance to pass this investment on to others in the family context it might be really
[time=1821] traditional for you it might be real disjointed I'm not sure but I know this I know that if
[time=1829] you know him and I know that if you are faithful to draw near to him he is going to give you the privileged opportunity to carry out your priestly function and be a priest at home
[time=1840] here's some things to think about just kind of work with me through this as priests at home God is honored I believe that God in what's true and right is elevated I believe God is honored and your family gets blessed they really do when you give great effort and priority
[time=1858] great effort helped along by God in the Holy Spirit and great priority to number one your
[time=1864] home and that might just sound obvious but write that down would you your home for the
[time=1870] priest watch this here for the priest at home it's much like the priest in the temple and
[time=1877] again this all kind of began this discussion of ours this began back with the people of Israel and there was even with the people of Israel this special sect of folks the Levites the Levitical priests and the priest in that day had had very special opportunities and
[time=1892] incredibly specific privileges the priest was to make the temple if you will the temple
[time=1899] was to be made a place of peace and tranquility part of what he did was the priest in his duties
[time=1906] affected the atmosphere of the temple as a priest you and I have this unspeakable privilege
[time=1917] of impacting the atmosphere of our homes the field the spirit of what goes on with our
[time=1929] families and whereas so many times our homes can become chaotic and disorganized I won't
[time=1936] look raise your hand if you can identify with that okay good whereas so many times our homes can become chaotic and disorganized we help our families my friends we minister God to
[time=1947] our families when we work really hard with God's help to have our homes be a place of
[time=1954] order and encouragement having our homes be a place of order and encouragement and I just
[time=1961] I just wrote down could have gone a lot of different directions on this I just wrote down a couple things and I want to just have you write these things down as well how do you impact the atmosphere of your home as a priest here you go here's a few things what you watch what you watch I'm not against the TV the TV is my friend we've learned to get
[time=1981] along over the years I don't think the TV is evil I don't think all broadcasting is from the devil don't hear me wrong but the fact of the matter is what they watch how long
[time=1992] they watch it when they start you know and when they end and all that goes on in between
[time=1998] as that thing just shoots out message after message and scene after scene what you watch
[time=2004] what they watch what they watch alone what you watch what gets watched together it impacts
[time=2010] the atmosphere it just does and you as a priest in that home with a specific purpose of passing
[time=2020] on God and his truth and his grace and his forgiveness and his humility you got to match
[time=2026] that up with the messages that they see and hear and I'm telling you what you watch has
[time=2033] a lot to do I've seen it I've dropped this ball many a time and I have seen what comes
[time=2041] out of that box into their eyes and minds directly within minutes affect the atmosphere
[time=2048] of that home raise your hand if you can join me out on this limb I feel I'm on okay another
[time=2055] thing what they what what goes on in that home in terms of what you listen to what you listen to where we're learning on this and we found it's actually a lot of fun and we love music I love music my wife loves music our kids love music and so we just work really hard to just at certain times not that you have to have something playing all the time you don't but when you're going to have something playing it's really nice to have something playing that's healthy that's good that communicates what's true and right and you can enjoy that
[time=2083] you can enjoy that immensely today it's not hard and you can even watch and listen you can throw in DVDs that communicate in really fun and creative ways all of that and you can dance like David danced and you can sing and you can shout and you can raise your hands
[time=2099] and you can clap and it can promote an atmosphere that is good and God honoring what you listen
[time=2106] to what you watch you write this down what you do I mean it just simply what you do what
[time=2112] do you do between five just ballparking it here between five and nine thirty what do
[time=2119] you do what are you doing as a couple what do you do with them what do you do as grandparents
[time=2125] to try and come alongside and help impact that what are you doing with this opportunity and I know you got to eat and you probably got to get some homework done but there are things that you and I can do there are times that we can spend that impact the atmosphere
[time=2140] of that temple of that home good priests at home proper nutrition good sleep appropriate
[time=2148] levels of responsibility you hear me appropriate levels age specific appropriate levels of
[time=2156] responsibility good nutrition good sleep all of it up to you it's all up to you and me all
[time=2164] of it furthering this atmosphere that the priests were trying to move toward peace and
[time=2170] tranquility to some of you and even to me at times that sounds like a pipe dream it's
[time=2176] not you and I can give ourselves to that kind of endeavor as priests at home God is honored
[time=2183] and your family is blessed when you give great effort and priority to your words write this down to your words and I said this first hour and I'll say it again second hour I would
[time=2194] just I'd probably just need you to extend me some grace on this one for me to stand here
[time=2201] at this stage of my life I would just have to freely admit to you all that this is something I I still don't do very well with I'm still working on this one big time probably more
[time=2216] than the others I'll get to here my words and not just my words but the way I say it
[time=2225] I really need to grow and I really need to keep at this one your words as a priest your
[time=2233] language in the home my friends sets the spiritual tone of that setting the words you speak yes
[time=2244] the way that you say them yes the communication the stuff that comes out of your mouth they're
[time=2251] like sponges they don't miss they don't miss any of it your words offer encouragement you
[time=2261] got options here on one side you can offer words that bring encouragement wisdom guidance
[time=2268] they bring reinforced love and acceptance how deep the fathers love or you can speak words
[time=2277] that are harsh critical demanding conditional and in so doing you can create a home filled
[time=2284] with fear discouragement and insecurity I just want to say that to you one more time
[time=2293] your words are powerful what you say and the way you say it in crisis in the everyday in
[time=2300] the morning at noon at night what comes out of our mouth has the potential to create enormous levels of acceptance and love and encouragement and help and safety or it can begin to communicate
[time=2314] a message that leads them to believe that in the everyday of their life they're going to live in fear discouragement and insecurity and here's a here's a basic lesson I again
[time=2324] I just I'm just going to keep working at this one you can pray for me you can hold me accountable
[time=2331] you can you can just do everything within your power to come alongside me I'll do my best to come alongside you on this one I need to keep working at this one thing I often think of it sounds kind of silly it sounds a little juvenile I know it sounds kind of it just
[time=2346] sounds kind of silly to me even to say it to you but I often think about the Bambi movie
[time=2352] there was this little rabbit named what Thumper and sometimes you know we can kind of laugh
[time=2358] about it but there's sometimes where I just I'm trying to learn what if Thumper say if
[time=2364] you can't say something nice just what shut our don't say yeah sorry sorry kids we don't
[time=2374] say that in the bird family I don't know what came over me yeah be be quiet just keep your
[time=2385] mouth shut and I know that there are times where we damage kids by what we don't say
[time=2394] but let's just be honest the scales are pretty tipped on the damage that gets done when we
[time=2400] say things we shouldn't say again and again and again and you and I probably just need
[time=2406] to be willing in our hearts at times to just step away to step away from the cliff go back
[time=2415] to the room shut the door take a deep breath and think this thing through because our words communicate and our words need to communicate what would be God's heart as priests as cohons
[time=2429] we want to pass along to them self-control and wisdom and discernment so you and I have
[time=2435] got to be careful we've got to be cautious and if you like me need help with this you ought to ask someone to come alongside like I have and encourage you and pray with you along those lines my friends as priests at home God is honored and your family is blessed when you give great effort and priority to your time to your time and I would just write down your time at home your time at home in the temple setting the priest had very important
[time=2462] duties and that were strategic in the process of helping people worship God the priest had
[time=2470] some very specific duties and responsibilities that were strategic and helping the people there get a picture of an encounter God the same is true for mom and dad who are wanting to be priests at home and here's the idea my friends on this one we won't get it done you won't get that done you won't come into that setting impact the environment give yourself
[time=2491] to this process somehow of reflecting God to those who are there you won't get all that done at the office you don't get that done somewhere else you get that done at home go
[time=2509] home sometimes you want to just follow people around you wish you could just be that little
[time=2515] dude on their shoulders go home go home now listen last week we talked about being faithful
[time=2523] at what at work I don't want you to leave work when you shouldn't leave work I don't want you to go in late I don't want you to leave early I want you to be faithful and diligent in the way you give yourself to the employer and the task at hand be faithful people in the marketplace and when it's time to go home go ahead and just say it go home and when
[time=2541] you get home pull into the driveway going to the garage shut the car off and just take two minutes try this this week try to just take two minutes maybe you shouldn't do it
[time=2553] in the garage because maybe like me in two minutes you'd have four on the windshield looking in at you saying what are you doing so sometimes I'll stop out on the road before
[time=2564] I make that turn into the driveway but you ought to just try this week to go home and before you get out just take two minutes and say okay here I am okay God I'm tired
[time=2576] it's been a long day but I want to draw near right now and beg you for the strength and wisdom and discernment I'll need in these next three to four hours to care for my family
[time=2586] to say what needs to be said to draw them toward what's true and right to conduct myself in a way that represents to them your love and your grace and your mercy you're with me just take just try it this week just take two minutes in the driveway or around the corner and understand how important it is that you and I be priests that represent that pass
[time=2607] along God in the home with our time what are you going to do between five and nine thirty
[time=2614] how are you going to approach that time look at Deuteronomy six real quick I'm going to read this to you later but I want to just show this to you Deuteronomy six it says it's a
[time=2628] great section here called the Shema Deuteronomy six these words verse six these words which
[time=2638] I am commanding you today Moses says shall be on your heart my friends you shall teach them diligently okay I want you to think with me okay I'm trying to be realistic with you all this morning and I want you to think with me about the hours of Sam Ballparking here don't get you know just work with me on this six thirty in the morning to eight five four
[time=2661] you know four in the afternoon till nine thirty ten I don't know when your crew winds down hopefully it's before ten but here's the deal just think about those time frames
[time=2671] and think about your opportunities to interact and know that you shall teach them these words
[time=2677] that God has given you this truth you shall teach them diligently that's not that's not
[time=2683] quickly you shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit
[time=2690] in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up
[time=2699] I just want you to look at verse seven there I'm not going to get I'm not going to start dictating this to you I'm not going to spell it out what it should look like for you I'm telling you that here with your time moms here with your time dads and some uncles grandfathers
[time=2714] anybody who has a chance to impact this culture this next generation your time as a priest
[time=2721] at home I'm not going to tell you how to spend it I'm not going to map it out for you but look right there somehow we've got to move toward that somehow we've got to move toward
[time=2735] this picture of diligent communication and modeling and relationship and walking and
[time=2741] sitting down and rising up and lying down and it all being about this privileged opportunity to see Christ formed in another I'd love for some of you this morning to just take that
[time=2754] home and I'd love to see what you come up with I mean that I would love for for many of you to go home and to think about six thirty to eight in the morning and four in the afternoon till nine thirty at night and and from a very basic practical standpoint come up with a plan to begin to just begin to maybe further the way in which you invest his heart and his
[time=2776] truth into their lives I hope I hear from somebody your prayers next as priests at home God is
[time=2783] honored and your family is blessed when you give great effort and priority to your prayers hey two things on this your prayers your prayers for them your prayers for them very important
[time=2795] and your prayers with them extremely important on the for them front I would just encourage
[time=2801] you and I'll just admit this to you there's times where I realize I should be praying for my kids you know raise your hand if you think that's a good idea okay great so I'll just
[time=2812] be honest we did sometimes if I get all five names in during the prayer at dinner I'm feeling pretty good about myself and feeling like I prayed for him I don't think that's I don't think that's the ticket I don't really think that's what we're after I think what we're after is you and I setting the alarm if we need to stand up a little bit later if we might
[time=2833] need to you and I being people who would pray for our children and I don't know how you've
[time=2839] done that in the past I'm learning as I go still but I'll tell you what one thing that's been really sweet for me is to just is to just try and maybe catch them at night there
[time=2849] when they're asleep there's something about there's something about praying for a four year old when they're asleep it's different than praying for them when they're awake I'm not trying to be negative here there's something about praying for a 15 year old when he's asleep
[time=2867] rather than when he's you know what I mean there's just something about them being asleep maybe we should just say it there's something about them being quiet that's just kind of nice and for you to kneel next to a bed with a three year old or a 13 year old and to just
[time=2883] kind of rub your hands through their hair and to look at those faces and to realize again
[time=2889] what you've been given and to beg God they're on your knees with them at night for the grace
[time=2895] and the courage and the strength to be who God's called you to be and to pray for them and their lives and their days and their futures it's just a really really sweet opportunity
[time=2904] and I would encourage you even if you're reaching your hand hand through the railing of a crib
[time=2912] to just do that to pray for them to pray with them you know I fear that we're raising a generation of kids that don't know how to pray I mean that we need to step back and take a look at this my friends so many times so many of us get into the habit of just rote
[time=2928] repetition with prayers that just get kind of flung out there and I appreciate the heart many a time but but you and I have the privilege of helping our kids learn how to pray you
[time=2940] and I helping our kids learn how to pray prayers of confession have you done that have you actually sat with your children as they've gotten a little bit older and helped them think through how to pray prayers of confession to their God I said to try and help them pray
[time=2956] prayers of adoration that to pray prayers of praise you and I both understand that it's
[time=2963] inherent in the nature of a child it's inherent in the nature of humans to be really good at praying prayers of supplication kids are masterful and we've and then they've learned it from masters who have their whole lives they've listened to people pray prayers about what they want need and prayers of supplication aren't bad God tells us to share with him
[time=2982] the desires of our heart but there is so much about praying they need to understand and priests at home can help them do that look right down Matthew six we won't go there but
[time=2995] just right down Matthew six go ahead I'll invite you to go to Matthew six later today or tonight because in Matthew six we sometimes forget sometimes the prayer thing gets kind of daunting and we think oh my gosh we're not quite sure how to do this well Matthew six there in that chapter you'll find a thing called the Lord's what the Lord's prayer where he says I want you to what pray like this nah it's not the only way you can pray granted
[time=3022] but you know what there it is when was the last time you sat down with your eight year old 10 year old 12 year old and really helped them line by line think through what it actually
[time=3033] would look like and be like to pray the Lord's prayer that my friends is not brain surgery
[time=3043] you can do that you can help them you can pray for them and you can pray with them let
[time=3050] me have you write this down as priest at home God is honored I believe and your family is blessed when you give great effort and priority to your faith your faith and all that God
[time=3061] is doing in and through you my friends all that God is doing in and around you your faith your journey with God a home or better said the family's spiritual health the quality
[time=3072] and depth of their faith oftentimes will never go beyond the faith of their mom and dad their
[time=3078] priests at home if you don't grow your own faith oftentimes you can stifle theirs I'll say
[time=3088] that to you one more time if you don't grow your own faith oftentimes you'll stifle theirs
[time=3094] they're watching they're listening they're taking notes if you don't draw close to God
[time=3101] if you don't exercise the kohan privilege of coming close to him in the everyday of your
[time=3107] life they can in seeing you not do that in watching you not participate in that as they
[time=3113] see you making a thousand other choices in your life in the mornings when you think they're
[time=3119] not watching at night when you think they're asleep and even just that sense they get from you if you're out there not making that choice they know it they see it they experience it
[time=3130] and oftentimes instead of drawing them close they get distant if you don't deepen your love
[time=3137] for God they can become cold if you don't tell the stories we've talked about this before
[time=3145] if you don't tell the stories of God at work in you if you don't tell the stories of God
[time=3151] at work in those around you if you don't tell the stories to your children of God's miraculous
[time=3157] life transforming work in the community of God that he's placed around you if you don't
[time=3163] tell the stories to those in your home then God then God can become a bedtime story
[time=3171] understand that if you and I don't help them see the life changing life transforming work
[time=3178] of God as we share with them what God's up to then then God can in time for them become a book on their shelf that gets read maybe two or three times a week or a month and they
[time=3191] miss out on the incredible miraculous understanding of how he does what he does look at judges
[time=3198] go back to Judges 2 I'm going to read this to you Joshua dies here in Judges 2 Joshua
[time=3205] who had been in his generation had been part of some of the most miraculous things that God ever did and as Joshua's time comes to an end in Joshua 2 Judges 2 8 it says this
[time=3220] Judges 2 8 then Joshua the son of none the servant of the Lord died at the age of 110
[time=3226] and they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath Harris in the hill country
[time=3232] of Ephraim north of Mount Gash all that generation verse 10 all that generation Joshua's also
[time=3239] were gathered to their fathers they passed away and when Joshua and his whole generation
[time=3246] while they did a lot of things really well they seem to have missed something here and there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord nor yet the work
[time=3258] which he had done for Israel I'll tell you what my friends I've experienced this in my
[time=3265] own life when you have a parent who tells you the stories of God at work when you have
[time=3272] a home where the work of God is celebrated and talked about and and wrestled with then
[time=3278] what it produces what it can produce in you as a 12 year old what it can produce in you
[time=3284] as a young adult is a tremendous amount of stability and confidence in a God who is great
[time=3292] and in a culture my friends where the winds are blowing so very fast they need desperately
[time=3298] to have a picture of a God who is that big and who does that much and who works in the everyday situations of life those situations that you told them about that you shared with them as priests at home God is honored and your family is blessed when you give great
[time=3317] priority great effort and great priority to your love we've already talked about this it's the single greatest truth I believe it's the single greatest truth that can be passed on from a parent to a child right down Romans 8 the very last two verses of Romans 8 talks
[time=3333] about the love of God and that is to be the love that you expressed to them my friends it's pretty simple watch this there needs to be in them there should be as they grow
[time=3343] up there should be in your family and in mind the sense that whether it's a spilled glass of milk or a pregnancy at age 16 whether it's a lie about homework or whether it's a private
[time=3366] addiction revealed there should be down deep in their souls because of the way you've offered
[time=3374] this and because of the way you've given this and because of the way you've extended this there should be in it doesn't matter if it's a curfew not kept or a struggle down deep
[time=3388] in their heart that we just don't talk about whatever it is they should know that there
[time=3394] is absolutely nothing they could ever keep your love from them they can't do anything
[time=3401] they couldn't go anywhere they couldn't make any choice ever they would ever separate
[time=3407] them from your love it's called agape and it is the greatest truth that you can pass along to them verbally and pass along to them and the way you model it how deep the father's
[time=3419] love and the mother's to lastly write this down your service your service my friends
[time=3427] inside and outside the home we live in a culture today my friends we live in a Christian culture
[time=3433] that has been so unbelievably influenced by society that now even in the church there
[time=3439] is this mindset that I come and I sit and you provide me a service it's called consumerism
[time=3446] and we sit in fuse and we evaluate we are part of a body of Christ we're part of a church
[time=3452] family but we're there as customers and it's about what we're getting and it's about
[time=3458] the quality of what we're getting and if we don't like what we're getting we go somewhere else where we hope we'll get it better and it becomes all about you walking through literally the aisles of a church putting boxes in your cart and we struggle with that you struggle
[time=3473] with that I struggle with that and it's about serving it's this point I'm making here preset
[time=3479] home model for young people the utter value of yes coming and being taught and equipped
[time=3485] but then turning around with sleeves rolled up with this mindset of helping and coming
[time=3491] alongside and giving ourselves away and dads moms it might be the dishes it might be the vacuum it might be the garage it might be the nursery on a Sunday morning it could be a
[time=3502] high school small group it could be serving in the inner city it could be serving in your neighborhood we've started periodically getting garbage bags in the kids hands and just walking down our our country road and picking up garbage we're just trying everything we can to just
[time=3517] communicate hey we're about we're supposed to be about helping we're supposed to be about
[time=3524] serving and mom and dad you get a chance to do that as a priest at home.
[time=3554] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=3614] You
