[time=30] Hi, I'm Sam Barfell and I serve as a superintendent of what I think to be one of the best Christian
[time=57] schools in the state of Indiana right here at Black Art Christian School in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=61] And I'm talking to you today because I want to invite you to consider and explore the possibility of having your child become a student at Black Art Christian School for the 07/08 school year. This is the point of the school year where we've begun what we call our re-enrollment cycle
[time=77] and we've given our current families that first opportunity to get their students re-enrolled for next year and now we're at that point we're opening up our enrollment and our registration for new families in our community who've not been a part of Black Art Christian School and that's why I would like to warmly invite you to explore that as a possibility for your family. Also there's several new and exciting programs for next year which I am very thankful for. First of all in our preschool program we have a three four and five year old preschool and we've expanded that and we now will be offering four day a week program with afternoon classes as well. In addition to that another new program next year is our full day kindergarten option. For our 35 years of history
[time=117] we have always had a half day program in kindergarten and next year we're happy to say that we're
[time=123] creating a new full day kindergarten option and already there are many families who have indicated their desire to have their five-year-old child be a part of our full day and half day kindergarten.
[time=134] So if you are interested in the possibility of being part of the Black Art Christian School community I invite you to visit our website at blackawkchristian.org and all the information
[time=143] is there that you need or the pricing structure and information about all of our programs preschool elementary junior high and high school and Jesus came up and spoke to them saying all authority
[time=161] has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Therefore go and make disciples of all new
[time=172] baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=185] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even to the end of the
[time=192] age. Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=215] Oh, sing a little song. Oh, the water so strong. Oh, the water so strong. Please be come and die.
[time=234] To find that out is truly vain. Oh, the water so strong. Oh, the water so strong. Oh, together we
[time=256] are great-solving flesh-or-bake.
[time=286] [MUSIC]
[time=308] Oh, Lord, you've searched me. You know my life. Even when I fail you, I know you love me.
[time=336] Your holy process surrounding me.
[time=350] In every season. I know you love me. I know you love me.
[time=368] At the cross I got my knee. Where your blood was shed for me. There's no greater love than
[time=380] this. You have overcome the pain. The glory fills the highest place. What can separate me now?
[time=410] You go before me. You sit by my hand. Your head above me. I know you love me.
[time=437] At the cross I got my knee. Where your blood was shed for me. There's no greater love than this.
[time=449] You have overcome the pain. The glory fills the highest place. What can separate me now?
[time=464] At the cross I got my knee. Where your blood was shed for me. There's no greater love than this.
[time=477] You have overcome the pain. The glory fills the highest place. What can separate me now?
[time=488] You turn away when you said that it is done. You turn away when you said that it is done.
[time=519] And when the earth falls from my eyes. And you stand before me. I know you love me.
[time=547] I know you love me. At the cross I got my knee. Where your blood was shed for me. There's no greater love than this.
[time=568] You have overcome the pain. The glory fills the highest place. What can separate me now?
[time=579] At the cross I got my knee. Where your blood was shed for me. There's no greater love than this.
[time=595] You have overcome the pain. The glory fills the highest place. What can separate me now?
[time=606] You turn away when you said that it is done. You turn away.
[time=623] You made a way when you said that it is done. You turn away. You made a way when you said that it is done.
[time=647] You turn away. You made a way when you said that it is done.
[time=678] Well hello again and good morning it's great to be with you again. My name is Kelly Bird and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour. We are so thankful for what God continues to teach us and
[time=688] show us here at Blackhawk Ministries and so thankful for this a couple month long discussion
[time=694] that we've been in this study that we're calling I'm a priest. Today what you'll see is the second to
[time=700] last installment of the current series and it is a very very pivotal time in the life of the series.
[time=707] It's a very significant morning and a principle that we've been waiting to bring to our people
[time=713] and I can't wait for you to see what God did with this effort. It's a morning where we focused on
[time=719] what is a real problem in the church today. I believe it is a serious problem. I believe this problem has diminished in many ways the effectiveness of the church and this problem is what some folks
[time=732] would call the clergy laity distinction and what I mean by that is that over the years for
[time=739] hundreds of years there has been a growing chasm in between the paid professional the pastor if you
[time=746] will and what has become known as really the common everyday church goer just the church
[time=752] attender. You've got the educated pastor over here you've got the uneducated church member over
[time=760] here and there begins to be this gap between the two and what happens is the paid professionals
[time=766] begin to be looked upon as the ones who do ministry when in actuality the Bible the scriptures say
[time=772] the exact opposite. Ephesians 4 says pastors are to equip the church goer who isn't just a church
[time=780] goer. He's a saint he's a minister as we've been realizing in recent weeks you are those of you
[time=786] who make up the body of Christ you are a priest one who has been designed to carry on the ministry
[time=793] of God in the church and so we want to do nothing but empower you encourage you and remind you
[time=799] that there shouldn't be that big chasm there shouldn't be that big gap in this morning's messages all about that. I mentioned earlier it was the second to last installment I can't wait for you to tune in next week and here pastor Rick Hawks. Rick will be here at Black Hawk on Sunday morning
[time=815] March 25th to kind of bring a conclusion to the I'm a priest series. Rick is a former senior pastor
[time=822] here at Black Hawk currently the senior pastor at the chapel in southwest Fort Wayne and he has become a good friend and mentor to me we are so looking forward to having him back. I hope you'll come and join us that morning it'll be a great great morning as he concludes this I'm a priest
[time=838] series and we can't wait for that. I also want to invite you to think about Easter to think about joining us Good Friday at 6 p.m. April 6th and then Sunday morning April 8th that's right it's
[time=849] coming April 8th resurrection Sunday morning we'll be celebrating Easter in a powerful way
[time=856] and we'd love to have you come and join us. Hey thank you so much for tuning in God bless you have a great week and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=891] [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=1156] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1159] well why the why the I'm a priest series why the I'm a priest series here's the reason because there
[time=1168] is a serious problem there is potential for the problem to become even greater but there has been
[time=1174] for years and years a serious problem in the church today it is a digression from what God
[time=1180] designed and a departure from what once was and it's been a problem for hundreds of years and in
[time=1186] some places it's getting worse and I described that to you I want to just remind you again because
[time=1192] I forgot one part while you have on one side of this equation while you have the paid profession
[time=1198] and you know what sometimes sometimes even the and I have nothing against our room and I have
[time=1204] nothing against those who designed it it's just interesting sometimes the very nature of the room accentuates the gap because here I am up where up here and there you all are down there
[time=1222] and sometimes even the way we structure a room kind of just plays into this notion that there's the
[time=1228] there's the paid educated clergy up here and there is spiritually speaking the uneducated common
[time=1236] everyday church goer out there and what's at stake here is the ministry of the church and when we talk about the ministry of the church who wants at stake what we're talking about is human lives human souls that God calls us to go and reach with the good and redemptive news of the
[time=1254] gospel and sometimes that gets hindered because of this issue this distinction between clergy
[time=1262] and laity now the problem has created numerous numerous tensions the the problem has created a
[time=1270] myriad of issues way too many for us to delve into at length today but I want to just share
[time=1276] with you three would you just get out of pen and would you just write some things down this morning three deadly issues and I mean deadly three deadly issues that if not addressed will continue to
[time=1288] diminish and I believe eventually render useless the bride of Christ the ministry that the church is
[time=1294] supposed to have the direction the church is supposed to move in the way in which we are to
[time=1300] function it becomes a distant memory from what God intended as these issues continue to show
[time=1309] themselves and continue to move forward three issues this morning that I'd want you to write down
[time=1315] and I want to begin with what I'll just call an identity issue an identity issue
[time=1322] the pew the pew and the pulpit I think in some ways play into this the pew
[time=1333] and the pulpit and the way in which we meet and again just perceptions that begin to kind of move
[time=1339] forward I am and many of you you know call me this and again I'm thankful for it I am a pastor
[time=1345] and I have gone to school and I have received training and I have been educated and I have
[time=1352] received some degrees and I have given my life to doing what I believe God has called me to do here in the scriptures as it relates to leading and teaching and loving the local church so I'm
[time=1365] the pastor and and you're out there in the pew and so many times what I bump into you know what it
[time=1372] is amazing like with really really bright people really really gifted people really really smart folks which most of you are I bump into this all the time I bump into it in this room I bump into
[time=1383] it out on the street I bump into it in emails there is this sense in people's minds there's
[time=1389] there's an identity crisis and you think of yourselves and many of you view yourselves
[time=1396] in in this discussion I'm who I am doing what I do up here on stage and you're just
[time=1403] an attender you're just you I'm me and you're just you you're a you're a church goer
[time=1412] and and there's so many times I just want to kind of grab folks by the shirt collar and I want to
[time=1418] just remind you that according to the scriptures if you know the Lord according to the scriptures if you've fully surrendered your heart and life to him according to the scriptures if you are a child of God and in so being you're part of the body of Christ which makes you and I the church the
[time=1434] scriptures teach that as a child of God as a part of a functioning member of the local body
[time=1440] God's word calls you Paul called in Romans in Galatians in Ephesians in Philippians in Colossians
[time=1447] when Paul wrote to the church he didn't say I Paul to the common everyday church goer at Ephesus
[time=1454] he didn't say I Paul by the grace of God to the common everyday a tender at Colossae no he said I Paul to the what to this I heard you say it to the saints
[time=1471] to the saints you are a saint some of you are just looking at me like you got to be kidding me
[time=1479] no you are biblically speaking in the midst of this discussion your identity in this endeavor
[time=1490] you are a saint a set apart one especially and uniquely set apart by God if you know him
[time=1499] he has set you apart to do the work of the ministry you're a minister you're a saint
[time=1508] you're a priest you're not just a you're not you're not just a sinner saved by grace
[time=1515] you're not some spiritual eor just an a tender
[time=1526] oh well no and sometimes I hate it I really do sometimes I just
[time=1532] sometimes there's no stairs oh well I'll just take a chance and step on that arm yeah sometimes
[time=1538] I just want to come sometimes I just want to come out here hi Marilyn excuse me thank you
[time=1546] I just want to come out here and just be with you does that make sense I appreciate the no you're
[time=1554] not the clap hi Marty good to see you again sometimes I wish we designed the room where I could
[time=1562] just kind of grab my Bible and come sit down somehow and just be here I like here honestly
[time=1568] I like here a lot better and I know okay I understand that but it's probably not going to
[time=1576] happen we're not going to tear the thing down and start over next week but you understand what I'm saying you all have a tendency to look up where up there and I understand again I understand
[time=1587] that tension I'm just telling you I'm a saint I'm a priest September 1983 fully surrendered my
[time=1598] heart and life to Christ and I became just like you a believer a child of God and he gave me a
[time=1606] certain role to play right and he gave you a certain role to play and it's just that when I practice my role and you practice yours so many times there's just this gap that gets created and
[time=1619] I just while I appreciate and I'm thankful for the respect I can't stand the distance sometimes so
[time=1626] this was kind of fun thank you high stoles good to see you I just want you to understand that
[time=1633] there's this identity problem oh how is that um and it's really really dangerous
[time=1640] because you all know most of you that know me while I'm trying to faithfully perform
[time=1648] my part in this you know those of you that know me you know I'm just like you you know that we're a lot alike in so many ways and watch what happens when this identity
[time=1659] issue gets away from us watch the progression I begin and other pastors begin to be viewed as
[time=1666] specialists and you all begin to play this role of a tender that goes on for a while then the
[time=1674] specialist begins to be viewed as almost like a spiritual dispenser I can begin to feel like a
[time=1680] paper towel rack in a bathroom seriously you just you you're just a dispenser you come and do your
[time=1686] part and your part is just to you know people just come you just give them what they need you say what you're supposed to say they take what you give and they take it and they they they take that in and then off they go and do their thing they come back for you to spiritually dispense more and then they become spiritual recipients moves from specialists and attenders to spiritual dispensers
[time=1710] and spiritual recipients and then it gets really really really really dangerous because then the
[time=1716] next step is I become a church you know what I become a retailer it's really true you run the
[time=1726] danger of me becoming leadership becoming spiritual retailers which makes you spiritual what
[time=1736] consumers and that my friends is the that is the furthest thing from what he intended
[time=1746] for you to become spiritual consumers spiritual clients if you will coming week after week to kind
[time=1754] of test out the product and see how the retailers are doing it is the furthest thing go to Ephesians
[time=1762] if you would go to Paul's letter to the church at Ephesus many of you have read this before let me
[time=1768] remind you who have read this others of you it may be new truth Ephesians chapter 4 here is the way
[time=1776] this is supposed to function this is what God designed this thing to work like Ephesians 4
[time=1784] verses 11 and 12 and through the church this whole conversation here is about how the church has
[time=1790] been put together and so for the church verse 11 he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and
[time=1796] some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers he gave you he gave you me he gave you us he gave
[time=1808] you pastors and teachers and as it relates to the ministry of the church he gave you pastors and
[time=1816] teachers so that verse 12 for there's that word for for the equipping of the saints he gave you
[time=1823] me so that I could faithfully do my best to equip the common everyday church goer no
[time=1829] for the equipping of the saints for what for the work of service to the building up of the body of
[time=1839] Christ my friends it couldn't be any clearer and it couldn't be anymore it couldn't be
[time=1846] anymore separate from this from this clergy laity distinction where the clergy somehow
[time=1853] end up holding the bag of responsibility the ministry of the church according to the scriptures
[time=1859] is on you it's on you and I don't say that I'm not slapping you on your wrist I'm not saying
[time=1868] shame on you I'm saying that's the truth this thing being furthered this thing being all that
[time=1877] God intended it to be the ministry of the church is on you and it is my job to equip it is our job
[time=1886] to prepare it is ours to train you for that great redemptive endeavor and Christian consumerism
[time=1895] comes about when people no no no not people when priests when when saints when ministers
[time=1905] designed by God to shoulder execute and carry out the majority of all church ministry inside and
[time=1913] outside these four walls when they begin to sit back and watch when they begin to sit back and
[time=1921] receive when they begin to sit back and evaluate when they begin to sit back and withhold
[time=1929] sacrifice when they begin to withhold giving when they stop serving then the identity issue has dealt a major blow to the health and vitality of the church and
[time=1945] all that God intended it to do and be we have an identity issue you know what we have secondly I
[time=1952] just turned I just I just wrote down an activity issue there may be a better way of saying it we have an identity issue that I believe leads to an activity issue now these points are very
[time=1963] related there's a lot of overlap here so give me some grace but there is this identity issue how
[time=1970] you view yourself how you view me how that starts to get played out it bleeds into this activity
[time=1976] issue because what can happen is a mindset of this what can happen is a mindset of in the
[time=1982] consumer mindset there can begin to be this attitude that says hey Kelly you do it
[time=1992] you do it and your staff you got you guys do it because that's what we
[time=2000] pay you to do and there couldn't be anything further from the truth in terms of God's design
[time=2013] on how this thing is supposed to function some will think in their minds you preach the sermon
[time=2020] you visit the sick you help the hurting you do the weddings the baptisms and funerals you hire and build the ministry team provide for our kids teenagers and young adults pick the songs rehearse the songs and lead us in the songs do all of that and we'll let you know how you're doing
[time=2044] and you do i'm glad we can all laugh about that
[time=2050] and i'm okay laughing about it as long as you understand that sometimes it's not funny
[time=2058] as long as you understand that sometimes this idea of getting a grade this idea of
[time=2068] you know six-month quarterly reviews this and the spirit with which it's sometimes given
[time=2076] is the furthest thing from the truth of what he designed and how he wanted this to be
[time=2083] what you hear so many times and you know what i'll be honest with all the don't hear it
[time=2089] i don't hear it as much here as far as black caucus concerned we'll talk about
[time=2095] kind of where we're at in this discussion in in a few minutes but what what will sometimes transpire one of two things either what'll happen is that the consumer
[time=2105] who's got the identity thing all messed up now the activity things become completely misconstrued consumers sits back and and one of two things happen either they begin to complain
[time=2116] they begin to critique and they begin to criticize your efforts
[time=2122] and what's implied there parenthetically is and you know and you better listen to me or we'll leave
[time=2128] you better do what we want you to do you better do it the way we want you to do it
[time=2135] you better meet my demands because i am a consumer and you are a retailer and this is
[time=2142] what we pay you to do or i'm out of here it's what gets communicated sometimes directly sometimes
[time=2151] indirectly it's either that or they'll applaud your efforts as you work yourself into the ground
[time=2160] in an effort to try and please what happens they're my friends in this activity issue is a
[time=2167] disengagement what happens so many times with the people is they fall into that mindset and there
[time=2175] begins to be a disengagement from ministry the very thing if patience for said that you're here to do
[time=2183] with the bulk of i'll do my part but the bulk of the ministry resting on your shoulders what happens
[time=2189] in these mindsets is a disengagement from ministry a disconnect from serving
[time=2196] with sleeves rolled up and hearts given to the effort inside and outside these four walls and
[time=2203] i just i love i love reading first Corinthians 12 turn there would you first Corinthians 12 just gives us a great very visual very very practical reminder i love it when things are simple i love
[time=2216] it just me i love it when things are just spelled out for us and when you go to first Corinthians 12
[time=2222] 14 here talking about the way the body the way the church is to function and again remember the
[time=2228] church is not this building remember my friends the church is not 7400 east state the church is not me
[time=2234] the church is not sunday mornings the church is who the church is you you are the body and the way he
[time=2241] put this body is church together it's just remarkable for the body is not one member but many if the
[time=2249] foot says because i'm not a hand i'm not a part of the body it is not for this reason any the less a
[time=2256] part of the body and if the ear says because i'm not an eye i am not a part of the body it is not
[time=2263] for this reason any the less a part of the body if the whole body were a kelly if the whole body
[time=2270] were a mitch if the whole body were a steve right if the whole body were an eye where would the hearing
[time=2278] be if the whole body were hearing where would the sense of smell be but now god has placed the
[time=2287] members each one of them in the body just as he desired if they were all one member where would
[time=2294] the body be but now it'd be in a lot of trouble but now there are many members but one body and the
[time=2301] eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of you or again the head to the feet i have no need of
[time=2307] you this is where it gets good on the contrary it is much truer that the members of the body
[time=2313] which seem to be weaker are necessary and those members of the body which we deem
[time=2321] less honorable on these we bestow more abundant honor and and our less presentable members become
[time=2330] much more presentable whereas our more presentable members have no need of it but god has so composed
[time=2338] the body giving more abundant honor to that member which what lacked and you say well i'm just a
[time=2351] no no you're not just a you're whatever you are you are vitally and desperately needed
[time=2358] and god has called you toes and hands and elbows and chins and foreheads i mean whatever you are
[time=2366] however he's put you together whatever passions you have whatever job place you're in whatever
[time=2372] circumstance in life you find yourself he gives you the opportunity to represent him to be priests
[time=2378] and to in this setting function as a vital part and the passage is very clear it says in essence that
[time=2385] okay i'll do my thing up here but understand the more honorable part or those folks you never see
[time=2391] and i for one and so while i while i am thankful for the respect i so want you all to understand that
[time=2400] there are so many in this place doing significant see we look at this and we look at this and we look
[time=2407] at this and we think significant no no there are so many in this place doing significant
[time=2413] ministry and you never see them and they're in the home and they're in the marketplace
[time=2420] and they're making films and they're working as police officers and they're in the fire departments
[time=2427] and they're 12th graders in school significant ministry as they draw near to god and pass along
[time=2436] god to others well the identity issue and the activity issue i think at times can boil down
[time=2447] to a horsepower issue and you may not like that phrase but that's all right tell me when it's time
[time=2453] for my review just kidding it's a horsepower issue and what i mean by and i mean horsepower i mean
[time=2460] energy i mean effectiveness i mean and here's what i mean by that when we fall into this identity issue when you view yourself as just a and then that kind of steam rolls into this
[time=2472] consumeristic mindset that takes you into a disengaged posture where you're kind of outside the realm
[time=2478] of really giving yourself to this life of ministry inside and outside these four walls
[time=2484] it just it just kills it kills the church because it's not the way the church was designed to function
[time=2495] when saints when priests when ministers begin sitting attending, consumering, evaluating, withholding the church sputters along with little or no
[time=2514] effectiveness because he gave you certain individuals to encourage and teach so that you would do
[time=2524] the work of ministry you say how much work well i'll i'll teach
[time=2532] as best i can i think that's what god calls me to do i'll teach and i'll do my very best to lead
[time=2538] as will the elders the rest biblically biblically the rest
[time=2548] is for you to give yourself to and and will help and i want to just say this to you
[time=2556] you know i don't know that i could have said this to you 20 years ago i don't know if i could have said this to you uh 10 years ago but a little bit of life had a birthday week or so ago
[time=2569] a little bit of experience has taught me is teaching me much and i can say this to you today
[time=2576] i can say it to you clearly i can say it to you without any hesitation and i can say it to you without any sense of insecurity i am not going to to preach this room full
[time=2590] it's not going to happen i'm not that good of a preacher but that's not how it was designed to be
[time=2600] in the first place this room will be filled when you minister when you minister this room
[time=2609] full that's that's how that works and Mitchell and Steve and Josh and Dave and others who come
[time=2621] and teach they're good men and they're good teachers and they're good communicators
[time=2627] but if you had the best leader in the world and you don't if you're the best communicator to ever walk the face of the earth and believe me you don't it still wouldn't matter because the way God designed this thing he designed this thing for you to minister this place full and remember it's not just about this place it's about your living
[time=2648] room and those who gather it's about the coffee that you have with the guy down the booth it's about you on the ball field it's you in the kitchen it's you wherever you are fulfilling your priestly function and that's how that works we do have a staff what about Black
[time=2665] Hawk let me just say this to you and i i want to say this and i want to be just as genuine and as heartfelt as i can be because i i feel this we have a staff a paid staff for the most part few of the
[time=2677] guys actually are volunteers but i want you to look at them on the screen this morning we have a staff here and and we do appreciate the way in which you esteem us the way in which you support us
[time=2688] and as the pictures begin to just kind of go by here and as you get a chance to be reminded of those that serve you in that in that professional so to speak capacity i want you to while while
[time=2700] talking about this gap today and we're trying to close the gap i think it's okay for you to look at those screens and be reminded of who these individuals are that give a great deal of their
[time=2712] time they give a great deal of their effort they make enormous sacrifices each and every day to do
[time=2718] their very best to biblically fulfill their part in this equation and they do it really well they
[time=2725] don't do it perfectly many of us make mistakes to this day and we're learning from those and we're
[time=2732] growing these individuals that you see on the screen they represent not only those who i get to share
[time=2739] in this ministry with they represent good friends these are guys i spend and share my life with
[time=2745] they're good men they give themselves not only to this family but but each of them have their own
[time=2751] families they take calls when it's hard to take them they make trips when it's hard to travel they
[time=2758] go to great lengths to try and shepherd and love and give themselves to this redemptive endeavor
[time=2764] that god's allowed us to be a part of here i am so grateful and i think many of you
[time=2770] are very grateful some of you as you watch these pictures you've been personally ministered to
[time=2776] by these by these guys who have given themselves to you in a number of different ways

[time=3140] because sometimes you feel like you're you can feel alone and to know that there are hundreds of
[time=3148] people you know in a place like this who really are willing uh to do their part to not be consumers

[time=3162] we want to just we want to be a place that empowers and releases you we don't want to mitchell mitchell often talks to me about being a place where we where we don't capture people
[time=3174] where we release people because churches can sometimes become kind of fortresses where folks just kind of get brought in and you never see them again and we don't want to be that kind of a place we want to be a place that that empowers and releases people to their priestly ministry the ministry of this church sunday morning is not the ministry of this church sunday morning
[time=3196] is supposed to equip and prepare you to go do the ministry of this church if we are going to go
