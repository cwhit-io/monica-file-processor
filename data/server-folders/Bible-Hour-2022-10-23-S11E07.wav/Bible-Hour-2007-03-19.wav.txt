[time=0] (eerie music)
[time=30] - Hi, I'm Sam Barfell, and I serve as a superintendent of what I think to be one of the best Christian schools in the state of Indiana, right here at Blackout Christian School in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=52] And I'm talking to you today because I want to invite you to consider and explore the possibility of having your child become a student at Blackout Christian School for the 07/08 school year.
[time=62] This is the point of the school year where we've begun what we call our re-enrollment cycle, and we've given our current families that first opportunity to get their students re-enrolled for next year.
[time=71] And now we're at that point where we're opening up our enrollment and our registration for new families in our community who've not been a part of Blackout Christian School.
[time=79] And that's why I would like to warmly invite you to explore that as a possibility for your family.
[time=85] Also, there's several new and exciting programs for next year, which I am very thankful for.
[time=90] First of all, in our preschool program, we have a three, four, and five-year-old preschool, and we've expanded that, and we now will be offering four-day-a-week program with afternoon classes as well.
[time=100] In addition to that, another new program next year is our full-day kindergarten option.
[time=105] For our 35 years of history, we have always had a half-day program in kindergarten, and next year, we're happy to say that we're creating a new full-day kindergarten option.
[time=115] And already, there are many families who have indicated their desire to have their five-year-old child be a part of our full-day and half-day kindergarten.
[time=124] So if you are interested in the possibility of being part of the Blackout Christian School community, I invite you to visit our website at blackoutchristian.org,
[time=132] and all the information is there that you need with pricing structure and information about all of our programs, preschool, elementary, junior high, and high school.
[time=147] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=154] Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=175] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=183] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=198] And who the mountains by God is mighty to save.
[time=205] He is mighty to save.
[time=209] Oh, yeah.
[time=211] All the rest of the nation.
[time=215] He rose and conquered the grave.
[time=219] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=223] He rose and conquered the grave.
[time=228] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=276] Jesus shined your light and let the whole world see.
[time=283] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=290] Sing it.
[time=292] He can move the mountains by God is mighty to save.
[time=300] He is mighty to save forever.
[time=306] Father of salvation.
[time=310] He rose and conquered the grave.
[time=314] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=318] Sing it.
[time=319] He can move the mountains by God is mighty to save.
[time=327] He is mighty to save forever.
[time=333] Father of salvation.
[time=337] He rose and conquered the grave.
[time=341] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=345] Shined your light and let the whole world see.
[time=351] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=358] Jesus shined your light and let the whole world see.
[time=365] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=373] Shined your light and let the whole world see.
[time=378] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=384] Jesus shined your light and let the whole world see.
[time=391] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=406] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=411] We are so thankful for the chance to not only share a broadcast with you week after week, we're really thankful to get to share our heart.
[time=419] And our heart lately has been over the last several weeks if you've been watching.
[time=423] It has been on this topic of the priesthood of all believers.
[time=426] We've entitled the series "I'm a Priest." And today we come to the conclusion of that series, and I'm so thankful for Pastor Rick Hawks, who you will hear this morning.
[time=436] Rick was willing to come and be with us this morning and I can't wait for you to hear his message.
[time=443] The theme of the message, the title of the message is turning an audience into an army.
[time=449] And that really does capture the essence of what we've been addressing in recent weeks.
[time=453] You see the church falls so short of what God designed when people simply come sit and function as an audience.
[time=462] When consumerism takes over the church, when people come simply to watch,
[time=468] they lose out on what God designed as He empowers and equips them to be His priests,
[time=475] those who would go and carry the life-saving, eternity-altering message of the gospel.
[time=480] And so I hope you'll be encouraged today.
[time=482] I hope you'll watch and I hope you'll open your heart in your mind to what God has put on Rick's heart to share with us this morning.
[time=490] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=492] Don't forget, Easter's coming.
[time=493] We'll be here two services on Easter Sunday morning April 8th at 9 and 1045.
[time=499] And what a great, great opportunity for us to meet many of you.
[time=503] We hope if you don't have a church home that morning, we hope you'll come and give us the privilege of getting to know you in person.
[time=510] Hey, have a great week.
[time=511] God bless you and we hope to see you soon.
[time=520] [MUSIC]
[time=523] Sing praise, I'll sweet the sun.
[time=526] Sing the rich like me, I'll ask what's what.
[time=530] Now I'm done.
[time=532] Find them now, I see you.
[time=534] Sing, sing, praise.
[time=538] Now, sweet the sun.
[time=543] Now, sing a wretch like me.
[time=552] And I was, was, was, was.
[time=561] But now, I found, I was blind.
[time=568] But now, I see, I see it was amazing.
[time=578] Sing praise, I'll sweet the sun.
[time=580] Sing the rich, I see it was once, once, once.
[time=584] Now I'm done.
[time=586] Find them now, I see it.
[time=588] Was great.
[time=590] That's what I'll say.
[time=591] Sing, sing, sing, sing.
[time=599] Sing praise, sing, sing.
[time=610] How precious did you say something?
[time=614] That great.
[time=616] That precious did you say something?
[time=619] It was the hour.
[time=622] I had first been.
[time=630] Oh, I believe.
[time=632] Yes, yes, still be.
[time=636] That your grace has set me free.
[time=640] So are you strong and so are what you're called as God.
[time=1043] And I wanted to tell you about my neighbor Sam.
[time=1045] She's been having a really tough time in life lately.
[time=1047] Her husband left her and she lost her job all within the matter of a month.
[time=1051] She is really struggling.
[time=1053] I thought I'd give you her phone number.
[time=1055] I know you're probably really busy today but maybe sometime this week you could give her a call.
[time=1059] I know she would love your encouragement.
[time=1064] Hey Cole, what you doing?
[time=1066] Trying to play hacky shack.
[time=1067] Trying to play too?
[time=1068] Sure.
[time=1069] So cool.
[time=1070] Guess what?
[time=1071] I don't know what?
[time=1073] Yesterday I saw you and your parents and your church is parking lot.
[time=1077] I was driving by with my mom.
[time=1079] He did?
[time=1080] That's cool.
[time=1081] I was just wondering, how do you like church?
[time=1082] Oh, it's great.
[time=1083] What kind of stuff do you learn now?
[time=1085] Well, I don't know if I can explain it really well but I learned about God in the sun Jesus
[time=1091] and I learned about his life and how he died on a cross because he loves us.
[time=1095] That's cool.
[time=1096] Hey Pastor.
[time=1097] Great sermon this morning.
[time=1099] I really enjoyed the part about being in tune to people who are in need and taking opportunities to reach out to them.
[time=1104] Well, I'm glad that spoke to you Mel.
[time=1106] Oh, it really did.
[time=1107] And I wanted to tell you about my neighbor Sam.
[time=1109] And she's been having a really tough time in life lately.
[time=1112] Her husband left her and she lost her job all within the matter of a month.
[time=1115] I mean, she is really struggling and I want to be an encouragement to her.
[time=1119] I was wondering if you had any ideas or suggestions of ways that I could help her or things I could say to her.
[time=1125] Let's talk.
[time=1128] Well, I'm so looking forward to this morning and the opportunity that God has given us to continue on in this discussion
[time=1136] about the priesthood of all believers.
[time=1139] The great opportunity that God gives all of those who know him, every single person.
[time=1145] The scriptures are so very clear that every single individual who surrenders fully his or her life and heart to Christ.
[time=1152] God, it says, enables them, gives them spiritual gifts, gives you opportunities and a calling to be the church,
[time=1160] to do the work of the ministry.
[time=1162] And while, yes, he has provided leadership.
[time=1165] And while, yes, he provides elders who have the responsibility for teaching and equipping what an amazing truth we came upon last week,
[time=1173] where everybody has the opportunity, everyone, to be a strategic part and to play a very significant role
[time=1181] in the life and ministry of the local church.
[time=1185] And I'm so thankful this morning to have someone here who first came to Black Hawk 30 years ago.
[time=1192] Pastor Rick Hawks from the chapel here in Fort Wayne, former senior pastor, right here at Black Hawk,
[time=1199] came to Black Hawk in 1977.
[time=1202] He informed me before first hour.
[time=1204] He was the youngest youth pastor ever hired.
[time=1207] He was nine years old at the time in '77.
[time=1211] So he's really not that old, you know, today.
[time=1215] He has been, for many of you in the room, and he has been for many, many people in this community.
[time=1222] What we sang about earlier, he has been faithful, and he has continued to give himself to the calling that God has laid on his heart.
[time=1230] God has done and continues to do amazing things, special and significant things through Rick and the team at the chapel.
[time=1237] And I sat in his living room months ago, and I heard him beginning to describe to me a series that he was going to do ended up being this past fall.
[time=1246] And the title of the series was turning an audience into an army.
[time=1251] And I thought about that.
[time=1252] I thought about that several times as we found ourselves coming into this discussion, into this study that we've been engaged in.
[time=1259] The priesthood of all believers and the great opportunity God gives everyone to participate.
[time=1265] And so I asked Rick if he would come and share with us today.
[time=1269] He was gracious and said, "Yes, he has not only become a friend, but a real mentor to me.
[time=1275] He has always been available.
[time=1277] He has always returned the calls.
[time=1279] He has always been willing to speak encouragement into my life.
[time=1283] He and Kathy have done the same with Kevin and I, and we're so grateful that he's here today.
[time=1288] Would you please give a very warm Black Hawk welcome to Pastor Rick Hawks." Well, I'm so glad to be with you this morning.
[time=1306] I look out and I see so many new faces, and that is wonderful.
[time=1311] I'm glad to see those familiar faces, but to know that this church is constantly reaching a new generation for Christ.
[time=1320] How sad it would be to come back and to see nothing but the same faces.
[time=1326] Some of the same people are here, but the faces are so different.
[time=1331] Well, I am glad to be with you.
[time=1333] Kelly, thanks for your friendship.
[time=1335] Deborah, to your friendship to Kathy, we have enjoyed partnership in the gospel.
[time=1340] We've enjoyed some favorite TV shows together, some political efforts.
[time=1345] I don't know whether you know this, but my wife's maiden name was Bird.
[time=1352] Spilled the same way as Kelly, so I'm sure we related somewhere and so glad to be related in the body of Christ.
[time=1361] Most of you don't have a clue of who this old guy is.
[time=1366] And please forgive me, I'm going to take some of the old people down memory lane for just a moment,
[time=1372] because many of you have asked about where's Kathy, how old are your kids, and what are they doing.
[time=1378] Kathy is the worship leader at the chapel, and we do four weekend services, so right now she has just finished the fourth service of the weekend,
[time=1389] and would have loved to have been here, but missed last weekend, at least part of the services is going to miss part of this next week,
[time=1397] and felt like she needed to be there, or else people would figure out, we really don't need the hoxes,
[time=1403] and we can just send them out permanently.
[time=1406] We have three adult children, and many of you don't remember them as adults, you remember them as elementary and middle schoolers when we left here.
[time=1416] But they are living the life of Andy of Mayberry.
[time=1420] Rachel and Rebecca are both married, they live four houses apart, they had babies four days apart from each other.
[time=1429] Rachel has three children, little Grace was adopted at age two out of an orphanage in Moldova, a former part of the Soviet Union.
[time=1439] And then she has a little boy by the name of Jacob, and Jacob says, "T-ball."
[time=1445] Which has nothing to do with a little tea and a ball on it, that's as close as he can come to Grandpa, and it sounds just right.
[time=1455] Then they have a brand new little guy, Jackson, who is about four months old.
[time=1461] Rebecca has a little boy, Hudson, who will be four this summer, and a little girl, Lola, who will be two this summer,
[time=1468] and her husband Fred is the principal at Deer Ridge Elementary School, and it's just like Mayberry.
[time=1475] You know, there's Opie and Andy walking up the hill to school, and they just have a wonderful life.
[time=1481] Adam will be 24 next month, and he and Carly were married about 18 months ago, but after four months of marriage,
[time=1490] he was activated as a member of the 124th Marines, and he is in Fallujah, Iraq, in the Anbar Province,
[time=1499] and I may mention more about that, but any time you feel led to pray for Adam, please do.
[time=1506] There are two songs that Kathy and I hold dear in our heart as we think of him in harm's way,
[time=1512] and one of those you sang this morning.
[time=1515] Our God is mighty to save, and so thank you for singing that song.
[time=1520] You didn't know it, but that was a song that would encourage my heart today.
[time=1525] Well, thank you for this privilege of being here at the chapel.
[time=1529] Let me take you through, and we're at Blackhawk, right?
[time=1533] You know, I did something like this in this auditorium about, oh, 19, 20 years ago, it was a hot July Sunday morning.
[time=1544] We were celebrating the patriotic Panorama, and I said, "Thank you for coming to the living Christmas tree."
[time=1552] In fact, there's a whole videotape of Hawk's bloopers somewhere.
[time=1562] We are at Blackhawk today, but let me tell you an experience at the chapel, which may or may not be yours,
[time=1570] but I hope the story helps you to understand the larger Church of Jesus Christ today.
[time=1579] On the 29th of August, 2005, the greatest natural disaster hit the United States.
[time=1588] You notice Hurricane Katrina.
[time=1591] As a response, Church is all across America, the chapel, Blackhawk, Fellowship, Missionary Church,
[time=1598] and many others in Fort Wayne, immediately activated, "What is it we can do?" And medical teams were dispersed, and construction teams were dispersed.
[time=1607] In the early days, the going was so physical, so rough, so uncertain as to safety that we only took men.
[time=1615] And many men went down on what we called chainsaw teams to clear out debris, to open up roads,
[time=1622] and I remember many men saying to their wives, "Honey, the pastor asked me to buy a chainsaw."
[time=1629] And there was a line up at Lowe's in southwest of men who always wanted a chainsaw and blamed it on the chapel.
[time=1638] Well, as we were trying to motivate people to come, we had done a little advertising on radio and announced a meeting in the community room.
[time=1646] And when we got to that meeting, we had a bigger turnout than we ever expected,
[time=1652] and I looked at the crowd, and I knew very few of the men.
[time=1657] And I thought, "Wow, people really do respond to a radio announcement."
[time=1663] And as we're registering men, they would raise their hand and volunteer for a particular job.
[time=1668] I just said, "Yell out your name, your phone number, and what church?" And they gave a name, a phone number, and almost every one of them under church said, "The chapel."
[time=1682] And I was dumbstruck at how many men came, and I had never seen them before.
[time=1692] And so I stopped, and in the middle of this, I said, "Guys, I'm really sorry. I'm meeting so many of you for the first time."
[time=1699] And one of them said, "Yeah, all you've ever asked us to do before is to come and sit and listen to you."
[time=1706] And quite frankly, we've done enough of that.
[time=1709] This is the first time you ever asked us to do something.
[time=1713] And I felt like I'd just been hit by a water cannon.
[time=1719] And in that moment, I made this discovery.
[time=1723] I had misled the chapel for ten years.
[time=1730] For ten years, I treated them like an audience, and God had called them to be an army.
[time=1740] It may have been the greatest meacopa of my life, and I have not emotionally recovered from that experience of realizing that for ten years,
[time=1751] I never gave God's call for that audience to be an army.
[time=1759] And so today, I'd like to share just some passing thoughts from an old man about being called into God's army.
[time=1767] If you have a Bible, would you open it to Romans chapter 1?
[time=1771] And in Romans chapter 1, a word that Paul uses repeatedly to describe first himself,
[time=1779] and then his audience is the word called.
[time=1784] He describes himself as called to be an apostle.
[time=1790] And then to his audience, first those who received this letter in the year maybe 56 A.D.,
[time=1800] but to Christians who would read it in every generation, including this one, he describes us as called.
[time=1809] Romans 1, 6, and 7.
[time=1812] And you also are among those who are called to belong to Christ Jesus,
[time=1819] to all in Rome who loved God and are called to be saints, grace and peace to you,
[time=1828] from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1834] Notice two times we are described as called.
[time=1839] The first description is we are called to belong to God.
[time=1845] I'll use an old word out of the pages of Scripture.
[time=1849] God calls us to be saved.
[time=1854] Now that word is relevant today.
[time=1857] It is a word that describes the spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical need of every human being.
[time=1868] We are in need of being saved, of being rescued.
[time=1876] You know, there are times in our lives when we think we need to be saved and we don't, and there are other times in our life when we don't think we need to be saved and we do.
[time=1886] Many years ago a group from Blackhawk, I have to slow down and say that, we had a Sunday school trip that went up north, got on the Pigeon River and we went canoeing,
[time=1897] and Bill Colp and I were in a canoe, came to a little man-made waterfall that went over about ten feet,
[time=1904] and Bill said, "Let's go for it." So boom, we go over this, hit bottom, get dumped out of the canoe, get to the side, and there's a guy saying to his girlfriend, "Let's do it." And she's saying, "No." And he's saying, "Yes." And she's screaming and boom, they go over, and when they capsize, this guy, not from Blackhawk,
[time=1926] has the ultimate dilemma.
[time=1929] The stream forks in his girlfriend is drifting that way and his beer cooler is drifting this way.
[time=1937] And his dilemma was, "Who needs saved?" I'll tell you, he made the wrong choice.
[time=1946] We all got on these cars that pulled the canoes back upstream and he was in trouble.
[time=1954] Many of us are in trouble and we don't know it.
[time=1959] T.S. Eliot writes a story, and in it he speaks historically of a great poet who was asked
[time=1973] if he had made his peace with God.
[time=1978] And Henry David Thoreau answered, "I didn't know that we had ever quarreled."
[time=1985] His heart was, "I'm fine.
[time=1988] Why would I need peace with God?
[time=1991] Why would I need to be rescued to be saved?" The most basic teaching of Scripture is what we will celebrate on a weekend to from now.
[time=2004] An event that we call good Friday, good for us, not necessarily for Jesus,
[time=2011] when Christ died on the cross for our sins and rose again on Easter Sunday morning
[time=2019] to declare that he had conquered death and that he is mighty to save.
[time=2027] Have you by faith received Christ and answered the call of God to be saved?
[time=2036] There is a second call that God makes on your life found here in Romans chapter 1 and
[time=2042] verse 7, "You are called to be saints." Maybe you heard the story about a pastor who was struggling, the church was not growing, the debts were high, the bills weren't paid, and they had a mortgage of $200,000.
[time=2058] Small church, big loan.
[time=2062] And there was a man by the name of Bob who came into his office and said, "Preacher,
[time=2068] my brother Jim died last night, and I will pay off this church's mortgage if you'll do his funeral."
[time=2076] The preacher said, "Bob, I'll be glad to do Jim's funeral." And then Bob said, "But there's one thing you have to do.
[time=2088] You have to say that Jim was a saint."
[time=2094] The preacher said, "Well, Bob, everybody in this town knows your brother,
[time=2100] and they know that Jim was a scoundrel and a cheat and a womanizer.
[time=2105] I can't get up and say he was a saint." And Bob said, "If you want me to pay off the mortgage, you've got to say Jim was a saint."
[time=2115] Next morning, preacher got his notes together.
[time=2119] Following day, he did the message, and he said, "Now you all know Jim never came to our church.
[time=2125] You know that he was a scoundrel and a thief and a womanizer.
[time=2131] But compared to his brother Jim, he was a saint.
[time=2137] Now you will find some of the strangest people called saints in the Bible, none other, none stranger than me except for maybe you.
[time=2148] Every one of us are called to be saints." Now when you and I hear that word saint, it usually doesn't conjure up a good image.
[time=2158] When I hear the word saint, one of my images is a stone statue in a gothic cathedral.
[time=2165] And quite frankly, I never wanted to be called a stone statue.
[time=2169] Did you?
[time=2170] Another image I have of the saints are the New Orleans saints of the 1980s.
[time=2175] They were so bad they were called the New Orleans Ains.
[time=2180] Nobody wants to be one of those either.
[time=2183] Most of the time when we hear the word saint, we think of somebody who thinks that they are better than the rest of us.
[time=2193] And Jesus talked about that point very directly.
[time=2196] In one of his parables, in Luke records it for us, in Luke 18, Jesus said to those who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else.
[time=2209] That's kind of what I picture when I hear the word saint.
[time=2213] Somebody who's confident of their own righteousness and looks down on everybody else.
[time=2219] Jesus told this story.
[time=2222] Two men went up to the temple to pray.
[time=2225] One a Pharisee, the other a tax collector.
[time=2228] The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself.
[time=2233] God, I thank you that I'm not like other men.
[time=2240] Robbers, evildoers, adulterers, or even like this tax collector, I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I give.
[time=2252] He was confident of his own righteousness.
[time=2257] Then the tax collector prayed and he beat his chest.
[time=2263] He said, oh God, be merciful to me, a sinner.
[time=2269] Jesus said, I tell you, this man left forgiven.
[time=2275] A saint is not somebody who is of the opinion that they are better than anyone else.
[time=2283] What then is a saint?
[time=2285] Well, the word simply means set apart.
[time=2291] Do you have things in your life that you have set apart that they are used for exclusive purpose?
[time=2298] Sure you do.
[time=2299] Adam and I have had a number of trips together.
[time=2302] We've gone backpacking in the Smoky Mountains together.
[time=2305] We've gone to Gettysburg together.
[time=2307] Two summers ago, he and I were roommates on a trip to Haiti together.
[time=2312] We got checked in the first morning we'd get up and Adam says, man, I forgot my toiletries.
[time=2317] Do you have a brush I can borrow?
[time=2319] And I threw him my brush and he said, I forgot my toothbrush.
[time=2324] I said, forget it.
[time=2328] There are things you don't share.
[time=2330] High on that list are toothbrushes.
[time=2334] You set that apart for yourself.
[time=2340] God has set you apart for himself.
[time=2344] The idea of being a saint has nothing to do with the comparative analysis of your conduct
[time=2351] with other Christians.
[time=2353] To be a saint is somebody who says, I have given my life fully to Christ.
[time=2360] My life is his.
[time=2363] I'm set apart.
[time=2365] There is an idea of motion in the word set apart.
[time=2370] Someone who has set apart is set apart from something and they are set apart to something.
[time=2379] You and I are set apart from this world and from ourselves.
[time=2386] And we are set apart to Christ.
[time=2389] We belong to him.
[time=2391] May I ask you a personal question today?
[time=2394] Are you set apart?
[time=2396] Do you belong to Christ?
[time=2400] Thirdly, we are called to be sufferers.
[time=2405] Let me ask you to move from Romans to 1 Peter.
[time=2409] 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 21.
[time=2413] Peter uses logic to talk to them about their own affliction.
[time=2419] To this you were called.
[time=2423] See our word called again?
[time=2425] To this you were called because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should
[time=2432] follow in his steps.
[time=2435] We are called to suffer.
[time=2438] And out of our suffering, God creates opportunities and ministry.
[time=2444] Somewhere around the year 2000, two guys showed up at the chapel.
[time=2449] After the last service, one of them came up to me and said, "Hi.
[time=2452] We are with the avoid volunteer fire department." And somebody said, "We should have a chaplain.
[time=2458] Would you be our chaplain?" I said, "Well, thanks.
[time=2462] What's a chaplain do?" He said, "I don't know." Well, do you have any idea of what my responsibility was to be?
[time=2470] No.
[time=2471] Would you be our chaplain?
[time=2473] So I said, "Sure.
[time=2475] What do I do?" He said, "I don't know, but we meet on Tuesdays." I showed up with Tuesday and I could not have been more the odd man out.
[time=2486] Part of the problem was I didn't know what a pumper was from a ladder.
[time=2492] I didn't have the right clothes on.
[time=2495] I didn't own gear.
[time=2497] I usually came from work, which usually is about hospital visits and funerals and meetings with all kinds of people.
[time=2504] So I looked like this and they looked at me like, "What did we get ourselves into?"
[time=2510] And for more than a year, I was the chaplain and I showed up every other Tuesday night
[time=2516] and at the end of 18 months, I had no relationship with the department.
[time=2523] One of the men died was churchless.
[time=2525] I did his funeral and they just sat there and stared at me.
[time=2530] Then on the 20th of December, 2001, my house burnt down.
[time=2537] And the fire department came and put the fire out and ever since then, we've been the best of friends.
[time=2545] And I was at the fire station a week ago Tuesday.
[time=2548] There were 37 men there that night.
[time=2551] Almost a third of them are active at the chapel now.
[time=2555] Why?
[time=2557] My house burnt down.
[time=2560] That's small stuff.
[time=2562] Let me tell you about Darla Pearl.
[time=2565] If Darla walked in today, you would say, "Oh, what an attractive young couple." She and Jeff have three kids.
[time=2571] Hayden is 13.
[time=2573] Riley is 11 and Carson is 6.
[time=2576] They look like the all-American family other than the fact that she has cancer and they gave her 20 months to live a little over 12 months ago.
[time=2586] And they're fighting the good fight.
[time=2588] They're going all the way to Houston to MD Anderson.
[time=2591] But they know that the odds are against them.
[time=2595] And here's what they spend their time doing.
[time=2598] Last Sunday, they couldn't come to baptism where their son wanted to be baptized because
[time=2605] they were at their third church this month giving their testimony.
[time=2609] And here's Darla's testimony.
[time=2612] God wants us to reach people in the cancer wards.
[time=2620] So I have cancer to be their missionary.
[time=2625] Wow.
[time=2627] And this is a couple.
[time=2629] That if you met them today, the last thing they want to do is tell you about their problems.
[time=2633] But if you ask about Christ, they will pour forth their hope and their joy.
[time=2640] And it comes out of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 where the apostle Paul said,
[time=2646] "We have this treasure." What is the treasure?
[time=2651] We have this light in jars of clay.
[time=2655] Literally cracked pots so that when we're broken, the light of Christ comes out.
[time=2663] The fourth thing that God has called us to be are sacrifices, Romans 12-1.
[time=2672] Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as living
[time=2678] sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, because this is your spiritual act of worship.
[time=2687] I loved being here this morning for your two hours of worship.
[time=2692] Songs, some of them were brand new to me.
[time=2695] And I'll take that one home about, "We'll remember your works." The director of worship, the chapel, is going to hear about that one at lunchtime today.
[time=2706] Somebody said, "How do you pick out the songs that are sung at the chapel?" I said, "It's really easy." We take, and I study the message, and then I write down a list of songs that I think would go with the message.
[time=2718] We take the list of Kathy, she throws that in the trash can, and builds a wonderful list of worship.
[time=2723] But I can at least take that one home as a gift from you, as a wonderful song, particularly as you come to the time when we remember the death of Christ.
[time=2733] And I love that mighty to save, and to take that great hymn, amazing grace, and allow some of the tradition and some of the new arrangement to come through.
[time=2745] It was wonderful. But you know the worship that we had today, it was done with excellence, but it was only practice.
[time=2755] You see, this time that you spend together, every Sunday morning, is when the team gets together to practice, and your coach calls some new plays, sends in a few substitutes, talks about what the strategy for the next half of the game is.
[time=2774] And the real worship never happens in this building.
[time=2779] The real worship happens outside when you go and you live and you love in the name of Christ. That's worship.
[time=2791] And you and I are called to be living sacrifices.
[time=2796] In first Timothy, Paul writes to a young man this letter of encouragement to prepare him for ministry.
[time=2804] But when you come to second Timothy, it is a good bye. It is a farewell.
[time=2810] And Paul says with the image of the Old Testament, my life is being poured out like a drink offering.
[time=2819] And I am being spent. It's over.
[time=2824] And you and I are called to be poured out, to be used up, to be spent.
[time=2833] In the Old Testament from which this metaphor comes of a living sacrifice, there are two things that were requirements of a sacrifice.
[time=2842] You were to give God your first, and you were to give God your best.
[time=2847] In the book of Deuteronomy and the book of Exodus, it talks about giving God your first fruits.
[time=2854] Solomon picked that up and echoed it in Proverbs 9-10.
[time=2858] "Give to God your first fruits." I'm a city boy. I grew up in the suburbs. I know nothing about farming, so I have to read the commentators.
[time=2869] They tell us that many of the crops had an annual season. Some of them had two seasons a year.
[time=2875] But when the figs came on, or the olives came on, or the grapes came on the vine,
[time=2882] then you would hurry to eat them because the season would be over and there would be no grapes.
[time=2889] And you may be waiting for the fruit to come, and it may have been months since you've had fresh fruit.
[time=2894] And now it's on. What will you do with those first fruits?
[time=2898] You're to give them to the Lord. It is a model that we give our lives to the Lord first
[time=2905] before we give it to golf, before we give it to a career, before we give it to our home building,
[time=2911] we give our lives to God first. And then we give God our best.
[time=2918] A sacrifice was to be without spot or blemish.
[time=2923] There was no looking at your flock and saying, you know, we had six sheeps and there's the run of the litter.
[time=2928] It's not going to bring much. We'll take that and we'll sacrifice.
[time=2931] You were to give God your very best. Are you giving God your best?
[time=2937] There is a temptation to give God our leftovers.
[time=2942] And say, after I do all the things that I want to do, if I have any time left, if I have any money left,
[time=2948] then I'll honor the Lord. You give God your first and your best.
[time=2953] We're called to be living sacrifices. Then fifth and finally, you and I are called to be soldiers.
[time=2961] God calls us to be soldiers. Second Timothy, two verses three and four.
[time=2971] Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
[time=2977] No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs.
[time=2982] He wants to please his commanding officer.
[time=2988] There are so many things I would like to teach you out of this, but I can only mention them briefly.
[time=2993] First, you are called to be enlisted under the authority of Jesus Christ.
[time=3002] You know, there are soldiers of fortune. During the days of the American Revolutionary War,
[time=3008] the British hired soldiers of fortune. They were German Hessians who would have fought for America.
[time=3015] We just didn't have enough money to hire them first.
[time=3018] There are soldiers of fortune on the seas. We called them pirates.
[time=3023] They were people who fought but under no authority but their own.
[time=3028] Your calling is to be under the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3033] This is not Adam's biography, but I heard a cute story.
[time=3037] This kid's 18 years old and he said, "I'm sick of people telling me what to do.
[time=3041] My parents aren't going to tell me what to do. My principal's not going to tell me what to do.
[time=3045] My boss isn't going to tell me what to do. I'm joining the Marine Corps.
[time=3049] Nobody's telling me what to do." Oh man, you don't have to be around the military very long before you realize you are under authority.
[time=3062] And today is your life under the authority of Jesus Christ.
[time=3068] Does he control your sex life? Does he control your spending habits?
[time=3075] Does he control your vocabulary? Does he control what you're going to do tonight?
[time=3083] Soldiers of Jesus Christ. We are enrolled as a band of brothers.
[time=3089] Powerful movie about American soldiers, but it's really a Shakespearean statement.
[time=3095] A band of brothers. Paul said, "Be a good soldier of Jesus Christ with us."
[time=3106] Do you know that when you live a purpose-driven life, you are in an army with Rick Warren?
[time=3113] And when you live as a godly man, you're in a fraternity with Robert Lewis.
[time=3119] When you serve the poor, you're carrying on the tradition of Mother Teresa.
[time=3125] When you tell a family member about Christ, you are the voice of Billy Graham.
[time=3131] When you are a soldier of Jesus Christ, you're in a band of brothers with the Apostle Paul.
[time=3140] You and I are called to be soldiers of Christ.
[time=3145] There are three types of people in the military.
[time=3149] Let me give them to you. And you're one of these three's.
[time=3153] In the military, there are those who are disabled.
[time=3159] They've been wounded. They've earned a Purple Heart.
[time=3164] And at the end of 2 Timothy, Paul talks about Trifemus who he had to send home because he was sick.
[time=3172] He was disabled.
[time=3175] Secondly, there are deserters.
[time=3180] And in 2 Timothy 4, Paul said, "Come to me for Demas, having loved this present world has left me."
[time=3192] He was a deserter.
[time=3194] And finally, there is a group of people who are deployed.
[time=3201] May the 1st, 2006, our son Adam was deployed.
[time=3208] Went into training. A few months later, he landed in Iraq.
[time=3213] And today, he is the guy on the Humvee with an M16 in his hand that kicks a door down
[time=3225] because he's been told by other Iraqis there are insurgents with weapons in that house.
[time=3234] And I think I'm a soldier. I'm a sissy.
[time=3242] And we expect our Marines to put their bodies and harms away for us.
[time=3248] And that's the metaphor that God chose to describe your calling.
[time=3258] We are soldiers of Jesus Christ. Are you disabled? Are you a deserter? Or are you deployed?
[time=3268] Let me close with a statement that Rick Warren of Saddleback, the famous author of The Purpose Driven Life, put together for his church.
[time=3278] It was a covenant that they signed on Easter Sunday morning two, maybe three years ago.
[time=3284] Today, I'm stepping across the line. I'm tired of waffling and I'm finished with wavering.
[time=3291] I've made my choice. The verdict is in. My decision is irrevocable.
[time=3297] I'm going God's way. There is no turning back.
[time=3301] I will live the rest of my life serving God's purposes with God's people on God's planet for God's glory.
[time=3310] I will use my life to celebrate his presence, cultivate his character, participate in his family, demonstrate his love and communicate his word.
[time=3320] Since my past has been forgiven, I have a purpose for living, a home awaiting in heaven.
[time=3327] I refuse to waste any more time or energy on shallow living, petty thinking, trivial talking, thoughtless doing, useless regretting, hurtful resenting, or faithless worrying.
[time=3342] Instead, I will magnify God, grow to maturity, serve in ministry, and fulfill my mission in the membership of his family.
[time=3352] Because this life is a preparation for the next. I will value worship over wealth, we over me, character over comfort, service over status, and people over possessions, position, and pleasures.
[time=3369] I know what matters most, and I will give it all I have God. I will do the best I can with what I have for Jesus Christ today, because I surrender to him.
[time=3385] I won't be captivated by my culture, manipulated by my critics, motivated by praise, frustrated by problems, debilitated by temptation, or intimidated by the devil.
[time=3396] I will keep running my race with my eyes on the goal, not the sidelines, or those running by me.
[time=3403] When time gets tough and I get tired, I won't back up, back off, back down, back out, or back slide.
[time=3411] I will just keep moving forward by God's grace.
[time=3415] I am spirit led, purpose driven, and mission focused, so I cannot be bought, I will not be compromised, and I shall not quit until I finish the race.
[time=3427] I am a trophy of God's amazing grace, so I will be gracious to everyone, grateful for every day, and generous with everything that God entrusts to me.
[time=3441] To my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, I say, "However, whenever, wherever, and whatever you ask me to do, my answer in advance is yes."
[time=3457] I am ready, anytime, anywhere, any way, any cost.
[time=3464] Whatever it takes, Lord, whatever it takes, I want to be used by you in such a way that on that day, I'll hear you say, "Well done, thou good and faithful one."
[time=3479] Come on in and let the eternal party begin.
[time=3489] There's probably no one more of a spokesman for Christ today than Pastor Rick Warren, but his call is the same as the call of the Apostle Paul.
[time=3508] Would you be a soldier of Christ?
[time=3512] Father, this morning, change this audience into an army.
[time=3520] Change the audience at the chapel into an army for Jesus' sake. Amen.
[time=3538] [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
