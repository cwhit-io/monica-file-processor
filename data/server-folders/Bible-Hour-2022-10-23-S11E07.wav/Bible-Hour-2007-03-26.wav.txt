[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=44] end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=58] "One is to land, you are holy, holy, are you Lord God, almighty, worthy is to land,
[time=79] worthy is one more time to sing it, you are holy, holy.
[time=88] Are you Lord God, almighty, worthy is to land, worthy is to land, almighty."
[time=107] Hi, I'm Sam Barfell, and I serve as a superintendent of what I think to be one of the best Christian
[time=116] schools in the state of Indiana, right here at Blackout Christian School in northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=121] And I'm talking to you today because I want to invite you to consider and explore the possibility of having your child become a student at Blackout Christian School for the 07/08 school year.
[time=131] This is the point of the school year where we've begun what we call our re-enrollment cycle, and we've given our current families that first opportunity to get their students re-enrolled for next year, and now we're at that point where we're opening up our enrollment and our registration for new families in our community who have not been a part of Blackout Christian School.
[time=149] And that's why I would like to warmly invite you to explore that as a possibility for your family.
[time=154] Also, there's several new and exciting programs for next year, which I am very thankful for.
[time=160] First of all, in our preschool program, we have a three, four, and five-year-old preschool, and we've expanded that, and we now will be offering four-day-a-week program with afternoon classes as well.
[time=169] In addition to that, another new program next year is our full-day kindergarten option.
[time=174] For our 35 years of history, we have always had a half-day program in kindergarten, and next year, we're happy to say that we're creating a new full-day kindergarten option.
[time=184] And already, there are many families who have indicated their desire to have their five-year-old child be a part of our full-day and half-day kindergarten.
[time=193] So if you are interested in the possibility of being part of the Blackout Christian School community, I invite you to visit our website at blackoutchristian.org, and all the information
[time=202] is there that you need or the pricing structure and information about all of our programs, preschool, elementary, junior high and high school.
[time=208] Joy, to be with you, I don't know when Kelly's gone for some reason.
[time=212] Every once in a while, he lets me do this.
[time=214] So I'm just thankful to be up here and enjoy just opening God's Word, and we'll have a great time together doing it, okay?
[time=221] So if you have a Bible, turn to John chapter 12, and as you're turning to John chapter
[time=227] 12, again, I've said this before, but if you would like to stand in honor of God's Word, feel free to do that.
[time=233] If you would like to sit and listen to God's Word, feel free to do that as well.
[time=238] The important thing is in your heart, let's just honor God's Word, and don't judge the other person whether they're standing or sitting, and then we'll all just get along, okay?
[time=248] So John chapter 12, we're actually going to read quite a bit.
[time=252] We're going to read from verse 1 to verse 36, and our passage on the triumphal entry
[time=259] is in there, so let's follow along.
[time=264] Verse 1 of John 12, "Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover came to Bethany where
[time=270] Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
[time=274] So they made him a supper there, and Martha was serving.
[time=277] And Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with him.
[time=281] Mary, therefore, took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the fragrance of perfume.
[time=293] But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples who was intending to portray him, said, "Why was this perfume not sold for 300 denari and given to poor?"
[time=304] Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief.
[time=311] And as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it.
[time=315] Jesus, therefore, said, "Let her alone in order that she may keep it for the day of my burial, for the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me."
[time=326] The great multitude, therefore, of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom he raised from the dead.
[time=336] But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus to death also, because on account of him, many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus, verse 12.
[time=350] On the next day, the great multitude who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him to begin to cry out, "Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even
[time=365] the king of Israel." And Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written, "Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming seated on a donkey's colt."
[time=381] These things, his disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him and that they had done these things to him.
[time=392] So the multitude who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, were bearing him witness.
[time=399] For this cause also, the multitude went and met him, because they had heard that he had performed this sign.
[time=406] The Pharisees therefore said to one another, "You see that you're not doing any good.
[time=412] Look, the whole world has gone after him." Now there were certain Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast.
[time=421] These therefore came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and began to ask him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." Philip came and told Andrew, "Andrew and Philip came, and they told Jesus, and Jesus answered them, saying, 'The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.
[time=442] Truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone, but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
[time=453] He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to eternal life.
[time=459] If anyone serves me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall my servant also be.
[time=464] If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.
[time=468] Now my soul has become troubled, and what shall I say, Father, save me from this hour?
[time=475] But for this purpose I came to this hour.
[time=478] Father, glorify thy name.
[time=481] There came a voice out of heaven.
[time=482] I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.
[time=487] The multitude, therefore, who stood by and heard it, were saying that it had thundered.
[time=492] Others were saying an angel has spoken to him.
[time=496] Jesus answered and said, "This voice has not come for my sake, but for your sakes.
[time=503] Now judgment is upon this world.
[time=505] Now the ruler of this world shall be cast out, and I.
[time=509] If I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself." But he was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which he was to die.
[time=519] The multitude, therefore, answered him.
[time=522] We have heard out of the law that the Christ is to remain forever, and how can you say the Son of Man must be lifted up?
[time=531] Who is this Son of Man?
[time=534] Jesus, therefore, said to them, "For a little while longer, the light is among you.
[time=539] Walk while you have the light, that darkness may not overtake you.
[time=543] He who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.
[time=547] While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may become sons of the light.
[time=552] He sings Jesus' spoke, and he departed, and hid himself from them."
[time=558] Would you pray with me?
[time=561] Father, we love your word because you show us how to live, but more importantly, you tell
[time=574] us who to love.
[time=578] And we know and we confess that your Son is glorious, that he is beautiful beyond description,
[time=588] and that he is worthy, so worthy of our praise.
[time=595] And God, right now, as a member of the body of your Son, here I stand, and in particular
[time=606] need that what I speak would be your words, that you would guard my words and that you
[time=613] would even guard my heart, God, and that all of us would see Christ more clearly today.
[time=622] And as a result of that vision, that we would savor him more deeply in our lives.
[time=628] We pray these things in Christ's name, amen.
[time=631] Thanks, you may be seated.
[time=634] Well, I want to walk through this passage and hopefully make it simple.
[time=641] We're going to look at two basic points, the setting and the significance.
[time=648] First of all, let's just kind of get an overview, get an understanding of what's going on here.
[time=653] Let's look at the setting together.
[time=656] Chapters 1 through 11 of John's gospel cover over two years of Christ's public ministry,
[time=662] but at chapter 12, John slows down very purposefully and spends the remaining portion of his book
[time=669] on the last few days of Christ's life.
[time=673] He kind of stops down and he gives a more thorough, basically a more complete narration as Jesus
[time=679] moves into his final week.
[time=682] Immediately prior to the events in chapter 12, Jesus has been away from Jerusalem for several weeks.
[time=688] He's been away from the crowds, out of the public eye, and John tells us he's near the
[time=694] wilderness just outside of a city called Ephraim and he's alone with his disciples.
[time=700] This chapter 12 begins then.
[time=703] The Passover is only six days away and Jesus knows that he is less than a week away from
[time=711] his death.
[time=714] People from all over the land of Israel are traveling to the yearly celebration to Jerusalem
[time=720] and the city of Jerusalem, as you can imagine, it begins to steadily fill beyond capacity.
[time=727] And the question on everyone's mind, those that are traveling to Jerusalem, those already
[time=733] living in and around the city, the scribes and the Pharisees, the religious authorities,
[time=740] the question on everyone's mind was this, will Jesus show up for the Passover?
[time=752] Their question is the result of the fact that Jesus' fame has spread.
[time=757] He has been in a public ministry setting for the past three years now.
[time=762] Stories of his miracles and of his authority are commonplace now.
[time=767] And the strife between Jesus and the religious authorities has steadily heightened.
[time=776] So they wonder, is Jesus going to show up?
[time=781] Well several days before Passover, Jesus does show up.
[time=787] He comes with his disciples to Bethany less than two miles from Jerusalem.
[time=790] He probably traveled a long distance on Friday and late in the evening arrived at the house of dear friends.
[time=798] Friends are so excited to see him, to have him there, that the next night they hold a dinner in his honor.
[time=805] Jesus is there, the disciples are there.
[time=808] Mary who pours perfume on Jesus, anointing his feet and wiping them with her hair is there.
[time=815] Martha is there, Lazarus is there.
[time=818] They're enjoying one another's company.
[time=822] People in Jerusalem begin to hear that Jesus is in Bethany and many make the short trip
[time=828] because of the accumulated effect of Jesus' ministry, his influence, his teaching and his miracles.
[time=835] They're drawn particularly though by the fact that Jesus has just recently raised Lazarus
[time=841] from the dead.
[time=842] There's a heightened curiosity and I can imagine it being a late evening as people continue
[time=849] to show up and the crowd around the house just continues to grow.
[time=856] Well, Saturday night, the next day, verse 12, probably Sunday, some people say that it
[time=863] was Monday.
[time=864] The word just continues to spread in Jerusalem and the city is just stirred with excitement,
[time=871] with curiosity, it's heightened.
[time=875] Jesus sends two of his disciples.
[time=880] It's not in our account in John, but it's in the other three accounts in the Gospels.
[time=886] He sends his disciples to get a donkey, to get a cult and they bring that cult back for
[time=892] him to ride on.
[time=893] He knows that this action will be a direct fulfillment of Zechariah 9.9 and that people
[time=899] would respond to the bold claim that he's making, that he is the Messiah.
[time=906] Sure enough, the people do respond to Jesus' actions.
[time=911] The crowds which were in Bethany are now following Jesus to Jerusalem.
[time=918] At the same time, others are coming from Jerusalem going out to see him and both streams of people
[time=925] just combine into one large crowd and they begin hailing Jesus as their king.
[time=935] They begin welcoming him as the Messiah as he steadily moves toward Jerusalem.
[time=943] The Pharisees are watching from the walls of Jerusalem and possibly some are even in the
[time=950] midst of the crowd as they've followed the crowds to Bethany and they're looking on.
[time=959] This is what's called the triumphal entry, Palm Sunday.
[time=964] It is an event of great significance.
[time=968] There's only a few stories about Christ that are repeated in all four Gospels.
[time=976] Before this event, there was only one, the feeding of the 5,000.
[time=978] That's in all four Gospels.
[time=980] But now this event is recorded in Matthew 21 and Luke 19 in Mark 11 and here in John
[time=987] chapter 12, it's a significant event.
[time=992] The triumphal entry is first of all the coronation of Jesus as king.
[time=1001] This event, this coronating him as king marks a big shift in Jesus' ministry.
[time=1009] Up until this point, he was reluctant to reveal himself.
[time=1013] In fact, there's several different examples.
[time=1015] I'll give you a few of them.
[time=1016] In Matthew 8, verse 4, Jesus heals a leopard.
[time=1020] I'm sorry, I said that in the last time, a leopard.
[time=1022] It's actually a leper.
[time=1024] He heals a leper and Jesus said to the leper, "See that you tell no one."
[time=1030] What happened?
[time=1032] In Luke 4, verse 41, it says demons also were coming out of many shouting.
[time=1036] You are the son of God, but rebuking them, he said to them, he said he would not allow
[time=1043] them to speak because they knew him to be the Christ.
[time=1048] You see, he didn't, at that point, want people to know.
[time=1051] In Matthew 17's another example, the three disciples are on the mound of transfiguration and they get to see just a little bit of God's Christ revealed glory as he's there with Moses and Elijah and they come off of the mountain from that experience.
[time=1065] And here's what Jesus tells them, as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus command them saying, "Tell the vision to know one." And in Mark 8, Jesus asked the disciples, "Who do you say that I am?"
[time=1081] And Peter says, "You are the Christ." Remember that?
[time=1086] The son of the living God.
[time=1088] And Jesus responds.
[time=1091] And he says this, "He warned them to tell no one about him." He was reluctant to reveal himself.
[time=1097] It wasn't time yet.
[time=1099] In fact, the people had tried to crown Christ King earlier in Jesus' ministry, but he didn't allow it.
[time=1105] After the feeding of the 5,000, when he fed the multitudes with just a small bit of bread and a small bit of fish, it says this in John chapter 6, 15, "Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take him by force to make him King, withdrew again to the mountain by himself alone." There was a Reluctancy at this point, but now we come to chapter 12, and something changes.
[time=1132] There's a big shift in his ministry.
[time=1135] There is now no Reluctancy on the part of Jesus.
[time=1138] In fact, Jesus with what is going on with these events, he's basically stating and claiming that he is ready to die.
[time=1146] And this is the appointed time for Jesus to be revealed.
[time=1152] In fact, if we could go and look at the same excerpt in the book of Luke, it says this.
[time=1161] In verse 39, some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, "Jesus, teacher, rebuke
[time=1167] your disciples," in other words, "Jesus, stop them from what they're doing.
[time=1173] Don't let them say, don't let them cry out, Hosanna." And here's what Jesus says.
[time=1180] Jesus answered, "I tell you, if these become silent, very rocks would cry out."
[time=1188] You see, this was the appointed time.
[time=1191] This was the right time for Jesus to be revealed.
[time=1199] Jesus is being welcomed into Jerusalem as the coming King.
[time=1204] The long awaited Messiah, you see, as you think about a little history of Israel for centuries, ever since the exile of the Jews into Babylon and the destruction of Jerusalem,
[time=1215] even up to their present subjection to Rome, they were anticipating a coming ruler who
[time=1223] would deliver them politically and nationally.
[time=1229] And for the crowds that have gathered, this seems to be the time.
[time=1234] They're thinking that this might be the time of their deliverance from the mighty hand of Rome.
[time=1241] Their nationalistic zeal was taking hold.
[time=1245] This is a coronation.
[time=1247] The people are wanting to crown Jesus as King and it's clearly seen by looking at what
[time=1253] they're saying.
[time=1255] It says, "The people cried out, Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even
[time=1261] the King of Israel." The word Hosanna means this, it means save now, we pray, or save now, we beseech you.
[time=1271] It is a prayer to God about deliverance in the present, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=1277] They repeated it over and over and over again.
[time=1281] They were wanting deliverance.
[time=1283] They were saying, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel."
[time=1291] You see, they were ready for a king to come and they were ready for a king to rule and they were ready for a king to conquer Rome.
[time=1301] These words come from Psalm 118.
[time=1304] It was a psalm that was regularly rehearsed as people would come from all over the land
[time=1310] of Israel to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover feast.
[time=1314] And as they would come, they would sing the psalm and they would rehearse this psalm.
[time=1318] And in this psalm, they would continue to say, "O Lord," verse 25, "O Lord, do save, we beseech you, O Lord, we beseech you, do send prosperity.
[time=1328] Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=1331] We have blessed you from the house of the Lord." This would be something that would be said every year in anticipation of the king that
[time=1340] would come.
[time=1342] And here as they see Jesus coming on the donkey from Bethany to Jerusalem, this is the time
[time=1350] they're thinking.
[time=1352] It's a coronation that's clearly seen by looking at what they're saying, but it's also clearly seen by looking at what they're doing.
[time=1360] The crowds, the multitudes who have gathered, some who came from Bethany, some who came from Jerusalem that they met and this large crowd accumulated.
[time=1369] They were cutting off palm branches and they were waving them and setting them in the ground
[time=1375] for Jesus to walk by.
[time=1377] This would have been similar to waving a national flag.
[time=1382] It was a sign of national pride and independence.
[time=1385] It was waving a palm branch and putting it in the ground was associated with great rejoicing with triumph and with victory.
[time=1396] Two centuries earlier when Simon and Judas Maccabees pushed the Syrians out of Jerusalem
[time=1402] and defeated the Syrians, they were welcomed into Jerusalem by people waving palm branches.
[time=1409] Was a sign of victory.
[time=1412] Now, there's no doubt that this is the cry of a captive people welcoming their deliverer
[time=1424] with great expectation.
[time=1428] At this point, you and I might be thinking, I might be thinking it maybe you're not, but as I look at this, I'm thinking these guys are nuts.
[time=1439] When you start to think about this scene, this carpenter from Nazareth, this humble person
[time=1445] who isn't coming into Jerusalem on a great and mighty war horse, but he's coming into Jerusalem on a meek and gentle donkey.
[time=1456] And they're anticipating him to conquer mighty Rome, the most powerful nation of that day.
[time=1467] I just in my mind, I'm wondering how are they thinking this?
[time=1471] How is Jesus going to be able to conquer Rome?
[time=1476] Where's his army?
[time=1477] Where's his might?
[time=1478] I mean, this guy's message before this has been blessed are the peacemakers, right?
[time=1486] And they're thinking he's going to come with just might and power and take over Rome.
[time=1492] It just, in my mind, it doesn't add up.
[time=1498] But when you look at this from a Jewish perspective, it begins to make sense, a historical perspective.
[time=1505] You see, this coronation was fueled by the history and pattern of God's redemptive work
[time=1513] for his people.
[time=1517] Remember the people are present.
[time=1518] They're assembling to celebrate the Passover.
[time=1522] It's a yearly event in the life of every Jewish person.
[time=1525] And the Passover is a celebration of God's miraculous and national deliverance from Egypt.
[time=1534] They were in bondage for years in Egypt.
[time=1539] And God, through the person of Moses and the ten plagues, went through this saga to get his people out of Egypt out on their own.
[time=1548] And they remembered these plagues and they remembered this deliverance, specifically the tenth plague.
[time=1555] Do you remember that?
[time=1557] The tenth plague, when their ancestors were told by God to sacrifice the lamb and to smear
[time=1563] its blood on their doorpost in order to save the life of every firstborn male, those who
[time=1570] didn't follow those instructions, specifically the Egyptians.
[time=1576] That night there was a great cry because the firstborn males of every house that didn't
[time=1584] sacrifice the lamb, the firstborn males died.
[time=1590] And Pharaoh, after receiving plague after plague, when it comes to this one, he finally
[time=1596] says, "Okay, go." God, through miraculous events, was delivering his people politically, nationally, from
[time=1608] the hand of Egypt.
[time=1611] And even all throughout Israel's history, God's choice for his people's deliverance was through magnificent displays of his power and the use or his use of the most unlikely people.
[time=1624] Isn't that true?
[time=1627] Think about the events for a minute.
[time=1628] As you think even about the people of Israel coming out of Egypt, and now Pharaoh has somehow,
[time=1635] for some reason, changed his mind.
[time=1637] And the people of Egypt, I mean the people of Israel come across the sea, the Red Sea, and they don't know where to go, and they're in camping, and Pharaoh and his mighty army are bearing down on them.
[time=1648] And what happens?
[time=1650] God just miraculously parts the water of the Red Sea and the people of Israel walk through
[time=1656] on dry land.
[time=1660] As they continue to go through Israel's history, I mean you think about all these miraculous events about manna from heaven, water coming from rocks.
[time=1668] The Jordan River is stopped, the walls of Jericho just come tumbling down.
[time=1676] These things are just not easy to explain.
[time=1681] They're miraculous.
[time=1682] And what about God using a shepherd boy to slay the giant Goliath when none of the other
[time=1691] soldiers were willing to do it?
[time=1694] What about him using Esther to save the Jews from the slaughter in Persia?
[time=1701] You see this coronation, when you step into a Jewish perspective, this coronation was fueled
[time=1707] by God's history of redemptive work for their nation, but it was also fueled by this.
[time=1714] It was also fueled by Christ's miracles.
[time=1718] It was Jesus' recent raising of Lazarus which was bringing much of this attention.
[time=1723] Look at verse 9 in John chapter 12, it says, "The large crowd of the Jews then learned
[time=1730] that he was there and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus,
[time=1737] whom he raised from the dead.
[time=1739] There was a particular interest about this man Jesus who had power over death."
[time=1746] Verse 17 of John chapter 12 and 18, "So the people who were with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continue to testify about him.
[time=1755] They were speaking about this event of what happened.
[time=1758] For this reason also the people went and met him because they heard that he had performed this sign." You see, the ministry of Christ was full of miraculous demonstrations of power.
[time=1770] And they did point to him as the coming Messiah.
[time=1774] And now the momentum of these events, the three years of his authority, of his miracles,
[time=1780] of his healings, all of this was growing to a climax.
[time=1785] The people had seen his miracles.
[time=1787] He had power over death.
[time=1789] They had witnessed his authority and they knew how God had rescued them in the past.
[time=1794] Surely he can handle Rome with his same power and authority.
[time=1801] But while the crowds that gathered were ready, are ready for this king to deliver them from
[time=1807] Roman dominance.
[time=1809] This king's intention is to deliver all people, not just the Jews, all people from the dominion
[time=1818] of sin by making peace through his own death.
[time=1825] You see, not only was this event the triumphal entry, the coronation of a king, it's also
[time=1835] the revelation of our purposeful prince of peace.
[time=1839] The triumphal entry is Jesus' coronation as king and it is also his route toward accomplishing
[time=1847] our redemption.
[time=1852] You think about the setting, you think about the events that were unfolding.
[time=1857] Jesus is like a master general, just strategically plotting, navigating, moving toward the final
[time=1866] climactic battle, Jesus is very purposeful, he's intentional, he's navigating his way
[time=1873] not to a throne as the Jews would have liked, but he's navigating his way to a cross where
[time=1882] he wasn't going to conquer Rome, but he was going to conquer death, a far greater foe
[time=1891] than Rome, and a far more significant victory for humanity.
[time=1900] And it is at this cross where he will secure peace between a holy God and people like you
[time=1909] and me.
[time=1912] See please don't miss what's going on here, what's taking place here.
[time=1918] The only king, the king of kings, the only king that has ever had the right and the power
[time=1928] inherent in himself to sit on a throne.
[time=1932] Do you realize that every other king, every other monarch, every other ruler that has ever sat on any throne has sat there because his or her power has been given to them by
[time=1945] God.
[time=1947] But now Christ has the power and the authority inherent in himself to sit on a throne.
[time=1956] And that king is now setting in motion a specific course of events which will in only a few
[time=1963] short days lead to this king's crucifixion.
[time=1969] Do you see the irony?
[time=1973] It's powerful.
[time=1977] The one who most deserved the praise and the adoration of men is choosing the route of humility
[time=1985] and sacrifice.
[time=1991] And some in recent years have suggested that all of this, the events of the triumphal entry,
[time=1998] all of this was really just Jesus getting carried away by the emotion and the stirring
[time=2004] of the crowd.
[time=2005] And somehow, some way, this whole thing just, he got caught up in it and it just kind of
[time=2011] went further than he ever anticipated.
[time=2013] And he really wasn't meaning to die but he was so caught up in the events and they just kind of transpired that he ended up there and it was by accident.
[time=2023] Some have said that in recent years and some still hold to that.
[time=2028] But what I'm wanting to say and what I'm going to say, I don't think you doubt but it needs to be said anyways, these events are not accidental.
[time=2040] They are purposeful.
[time=2043] They are intentional.
[time=2047] Listen when Jesus sent for the donkey, the cult to ride in on to Jerusalem, it's recorded
[time=2056] in the other three gospels, it's not specifically here in John, it's stated a little bit different.
[time=2062] But in the other three gospels, he sends his disciples to a nearby village to grab, to get a donkey, to bring it back, that he could ride in to Jerusalem on this donkey.
[time=2071] And he did that.
[time=2073] When he sent for that donkey, he knew that Zechariah 9-9 would enter and come to the minds of the people.
[time=2079] It says this in Zechariah 9-9, rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.
[time=2084] This is messianic.
[time=2086] This is a prophecy of a coming king.
[time=2089] Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem, behold, your king is coming to you.
[time=2094] He is just and endowed with salvation, humble and mounted on a donkey, even on a cult, the
[time=2100] full of a donkey.
[time=2104] You see what's going on here?
[time=2107] He is blatantly, boldly fulfilling messianic prophecy.
[time=2113] He is using the events of this scene to set his own trap with the Pharisees and with the crowds.
[time=2121] You see with the Pharisees, they never believed that he was the Messiah.
[time=2125] And now, as they watch this whole event from the walls of Jerusalem and as they're in the midst of the crowd, now they're just dismayed, now they're outraged, now their strife between him is just totally heightened because they can't believe the presumption of this Jesus
[time=2144] who would allow the crowds to enter him in Jerusalem this way.
[time=2151] And the crowds, what about the crowds?
[time=2156] Jesus knew that the crowds would become maybe in just a few short hours, maybe the next
[time=2163] day, maybe in three days, but definitely by four days, the crowds would become disappointed.
[time=2172] And the crowds would become frustrated with his non-political purpose, wondering why he
[time=2179] isn't conquering Rome.
[time=2183] See when you look at this event, sometimes it doesn't make sense.
[time=2186] How is it that the crowds of the people who have gathered there for the Passover on Sunday
[time=2192] were hailing him as king and five or four short days later, they were yelling, "Crucify
[time=2198] him." What changed?
[time=2203] How does that all come together?
[time=2207] Because all of these people, all of these events were made to serve the unfolding plan
[time=2216] of God as Christ moved toward his defining victory at Calvary.
[time=2223] You see, no one was going to defy him.
[time=2226] Not the crowds, not the Pharisees, not Rome, not even a betraying disciple.
[time=2234] He was headed very purposely, very intentionally to a hill called Golgotha, where he would suffer
[time=2244] and die and be our Prince of Peace.
[time=2248] So as I think about this, I wonder, why did he do this?
[time=2253] Why did this unfold this way?
[time=2258] Verse 23 tells us, I think, Jesus answered them saying, "The hour has come for the Son
[time=2267] of Man to be glorified." Why was he doing this?
[time=2272] His hour had come.
[time=2274] In the book of John, he talks all throughout his ministry, the hour was coming.
[time=2279] The hour was coming, but it's not yet here, but here, in John chapter 12, the hour has
[time=2285] come.
[time=2286] Why, for what?
[time=2288] For the Son of Man to be glorified.
[time=2291] Well, what was he meaning when he said this?
[time=2295] Look at verse 24, I think it gives us insight by way of analogy.
[time=2300] Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it
[time=2307] remains alone, but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
[time=2314] So he's talking about his death and the necessity of his death to bear much fruit, the salvation
[time=2328] of a host of people, which includes you and me if we place our faith and trust in Christ.
[time=2335] Look at verse 32 and 33 tells us even a little bit more specifically, Jesus says to the people,
[time=2343] and I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to myself, but he was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which he was to die.
[time=2353] What was Jesus meaning when he said the hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified?
[time=2359] Well to be glorified in this context, in this setting, to be glorified was to die, to be
[time=2367] crucified.
[time=2368] You could say it this way, the hour has come for the Son of Man to be crucified.
[time=2376] Jesus was claiming in verse 23 that his crucifixion was going to bring him great glory.
[time=2386] And as I think about that, it's hard to look and it's even hard to understand that something
[time=2395] as brutal and even evil and even as bloody as the crucifixion can bring glory to anything.
[time=2403] Isn't that hard to understand?
[time=2408] And yet that's exactly what was happening.
[time=2411] You see God's plan provided salvation for a great host of people, not just the Jews,
[time=2419] people from every tribe and every tongue, from every nation.
[time=2422] See I find it interesting that in the midst of all that's going on in John chapter 12,
[time=2428] there's just this little caveat of verses 20 through 23, 21 and 22.
[time=2434] And it's this excerpt about some Greeks who are coming to the Passover and it just doesn't seem like it fits.
[time=2440] It's kind of like what is this doing here?
[time=2445] And yet John is making a very specific point.
[time=2450] The cross would be the event in history which would level everyone that has walked the earth.
[time=2456] You ever heard the phrase, the ground is level at the foot of the cross?
[time=2461] By introducing these Greeks who come to see and say, sir, we wish to see Jesus, think that's
[time=2469] just all a part of this climax of Jesus, not just accomplishing or not accomplishing physical
[time=2476] redemption for his people, Israel, but bringing peace to a new people, a people from all over
[time=2486] the world.
[time=2489] Look again at verse 32, he says, "And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to myself." Even the Greeks that just came, yeah, even those Greeks.
[time=2504] And look at Zechariah 9, 9 again, this is one of the things that you guys don't always get to see the context when we use cross-references.
[time=2512] But there's more to Zechariah 9 and that Messianic prophecy than verse 9.
[time=2517] It goes on in verse 10 and it says this, in verse 10, he says, "I will cut off the chariot
[time=2524] from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem and the bow of war will be cut off.
[time=2528] And he, the he of verse 9, the coming king, rejoice, O daughters, your king is coming."
[time=2535] Well, this king will speak peace to the nations.
[time=2544] Somehow the Jews missed verse 10.
[time=2546] They were ready for verse 9.
[time=2550] His dominion will be from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth.
[time=2555] That was something as evil and as brutal and as bloody as the crucifixion glory.
[time=2560] Well, Christ is glorified by his crucifixion in that he provides atonement for the sins
[time=2566] of the whole world through his sacrifice.
[time=2570] It is, this is a universal act of redemption which will result in the ongoing eternal praise
[time=2576] of the exalted Christ forever from the tongues of every people group.
[time=2583] It's a scene in Revelation.
[time=2587] And also, Christ is glorified by his crucifixion in that the gospel and the gospel is just
[time=2595] the good news that Christ died for our sins.
[time=2600] It's the event that we're talking about today.
[time=2605] Christ is glorified by his crucifixion in that the gospel empowers us every single day of
[time=2613] our lives.
[time=2614] Do you understand that the gospel just isn't for our salvation?
[time=2620] The gospel is for our sanctification as well.
[time=2624] It empowers us for daily living.
[time=2626] Listen to this.
[time=2627] The gospel frees us from condemnation because every last part of the wrath of God which
[time=2635] you and I deserve was spent on him.
[time=2641] There's none left.
[time=2647] What does that do?
[time=2649] That just exalts him.
[time=2653] That just brings him glory.
[time=2655] No one else could do what he did.
[time=2658] No one else has done what he did.
[time=2666] Because of Christ's work, you don't have to carry the weight of your guilt anymore.
[time=2672] That's empowering every day because we're tempted to carry that guilt.
[time=2678] Instead, we need to take it to the cross and realize that that wrath was spent on our Redeemer.
[time=2687] It also rescues us from the power of the law by bringing peace through faith because you
[time=2696] know what?
[time=2697] You and I could not add one single act of goodness to what God has accomplished for us.
[time=2706] We can't be good enough to earn our salvation and we can't add anything else to what Christ has already accomplished.
[time=2712] It is full and it is finished.
[time=2716] Because of Christ's work, you don't have to perform for God.
[time=2721] You realize that on a daily basis.
[time=2727] Your right standing with God doesn't consist of your performance.
[time=2735] He frees us from that and he frees us to pursue him with great energy and excitement.
[time=2743] The crucifixion is glorious because it provides that.
[time=2751] Something else, the gospel romances our souls.
[time=2757] Do you know that?
[time=2758] Have you ever let the gospel just do that?
[time=2760] The gospel romances our souls by showing us what extent God went to in order to redeem
[time=2767] us.
[time=2770] How could we not love him back?
[time=2773] He wooves us with his love.
[time=2776] Because of Christ's work, you don't have to wonder if God loves you.
[time=2783] Crucifixion is the greatest statement, the greatest example of love that you and I will
[time=2792] ever consider and ever be able to embrace.
[time=2798] You know what?
[time=2799] It provides other things.
[time=2800] It provides the gospel, provides the motivation to forgive and to love and to serve one another.
[time=2808] It gives us the example how to do it.
[time=2811] You see the most significant and awful event in the annals of time is the glory of our crucified redeemer.
[time=2818] It seals our salvation and it empowers us to live on a daily basis for his glory.
[time=2824] It makes much of him.
[time=2827] That's what glory is.
[time=2829] It's boasting in something or boasting in someone.
[time=2833] We get to glory in our crucified redeemer.
[time=2836] Let me ask you just quickly as we close, how will you respond?
[time=2843] You know the Pharisees rejected him as the Messiah because they didn't want to give up
[time=2849] their way of life, those things that they had grown accustomed to.
[time=2852] You know there might be some of you today who have never crossed over the line of faith.
[time=2860] You've never come to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[time=2868] We'd love for you to cross over that line today.
[time=2872] That's why the book of John was written that you may know that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=2880] Some of you, maybe today, and this is me a lot of times, some of you are like the crowds
[time=2886] that gathered, they wanted a physical deliverer.
[time=2891] But when they didn't get what they wanted, they quickly turned.
[time=2896] They revealed him, I mean they, they hailed him correctly, he was the king but they were doing it for the wrong reasons.
[time=2902] Sometimes you and I get caught in that trap and we come to God and we think that we want
[time=2908] so much from him.
[time=2910] We want him to provide certain things for us, comfort or relaxation or a 401k fund or something
[time=2918] of that nature.
[time=2919] And when we don't get it, we get upset and we're tempted to turn from him.
[time=2928] We're like that.
[time=2929] We treat God as a cosmic vending machine.
[time=2933] God feel just do this for me that I'll serve you, but God is worthy that no matter what
[time=2942] comes my way, I want to serve him.
[time=2945] It's the third response, the disciples.
[time=2949] Although they didn't know everything, it tells us in the book of John, they obeyed and they followed and we can read in Acts the wonderful birth of the church, the ministry
[time=2961] of these disciples, they learn to live every day in the power of the gospel.
[time=2968] You know, I guess as we lead up to good Friday and as we lead to resurrection Sunday, this
[time=2978] week I just, I just would ask you, as you think about the events of the triumphal entry,
[time=2988] we just would ask you to glory in your Redeemer, the king of kings who humbled himself to
[time=3000] make peace with us through his death.
[time=3006] Would you do that this week?
[time=3007] I'm going to ask Corbin to come up and some others and they're going to sing a song and
[time=3014] I want to read these words to you if you want to just close your eyes and listen or if it
[time=3020] would be helpful for you to look up at the screen.
[time=3024] But here's what this song says.
[time=3027] I will glory in my Redeemer whose priceless blood has ransomed me.
[time=3035] Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails and hung him on that judgment tree.
[time=3040] I will glory in my Redeemer who crushed the power of sin and death my only Savior before
[time=3050] the Holy Judge, the Lamb who is my righteousness.
[time=3055] I will glory in my Redeemer, my life he bought, my love he owns.
[time=3065] I have no longings for another.
[time=3069] I'm satisfied in him alone.
[time=3073] I will glory in my Redeemer his faithfulness, my standing place.
[time=3077] Though foes are mighty and rush upon me, my feet are firm held by his grace.
[time=3083] I will glory in my Redeemer who carries me on eagle's wings.
[time=3089] He crowns my life with loving kindness, his triumph song I'll ever sing.
[time=3096] I will glory in my Redeemer who waits for me at gates of gold and when he calls me it
[time=3114] will be paradise, his face forever to behold.
[time=3140] I will glory in my Redeemer whose priceless blood has ransomed me.
[time=3152] Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails and hung him on that judgment tree.
[time=3164] I will glory in my Redeemer who crushed the power of sin and death my only Savior before
[time=3179] the holy church, the Lamb who is my righteousness, the Lamb who is my righteousness.
[time=3194] I will glory in my Redeemer my life he bought my love he owns.
[time=3212] I have no longings for another.
[time=3218] I will glory in my Redeemer his faithfulness, my standing place.
[time=3233] Though foes are mighty and rush upon me, my feet are firm held by his grace.
[time=3244] My feet are firm held by his faith.
[time=3262] I will glory in my Redeemer who carries me upon me whose dreams he caught my life with
[time=3283] loving kindness, his triumph song I'll ever sing.
[time=3290] I will glory in my Redeemer who wins for me at the case of gold and when he calls me
[time=3303] it will be paradise, his face forever to behold, his face forever to behold.
[time=3320] His face forever to behold, I am glory in my Redeemer in my Redeemer.
[time=3350] Would you do that this week?
[time=3360] Would you just make it your goal the glory in your Redeemer to boast in him?
[time=3368] If you need a prayer there will be some elders at the front we'd love to pray with you, we'd love to just hear any concerns that you might have and administer you in that way.
[time=3379] But I just want to say again thanks for coming to all of you, I just pray that you'd be captured
[time=3387] and that you would stand in awe of the King of Kings who purposefully set his face to Jerusalem
[time=3397] to make peace between a holy God and you.
[time=3401] Let me pray.
[time=3403] God thank you so much for your love and for your grace, thank you so much that you are easy to love.
[time=3411] You are easy to trust.
[time=3416] God I pray that we would ever be thankful for what you have accomplished in saving us.
[time=3423] And then Lord would you please empower us to live by the glories of your gospel.
[time=3432] What would you not give up on us no matter where each one of us are we need to continually
[time=3441] be romanced by you.
[time=3445] So I just ask this week that you would do that in our hearts and in our lives that we
[time=3453] would see you more clearly than we ever have before and it would enlarge our hearts to
[time=3460] love you back.
[time=3463] But I'm so grateful that we will see your face.
[time=3470] It will be paradise because forever your face will be there to behold.
[time=3477] We love you.
[time=3478] In Christ's name we pray, amen.
