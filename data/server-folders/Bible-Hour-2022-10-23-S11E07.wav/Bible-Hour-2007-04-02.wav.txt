[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=44] end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=58] "His body lay, light of the world by darkness slain, then bursting forth in glorious day,
[time=76] come from the great heroes again, and as He stands in victory, since Christ has lost
[time=88] His grip on me, for I am His, and He is mine, one to the precious blood of Christ."
[time=105] "No guilt in life, no fear in death, this is the power of Christ in me, from Christ
[time=116] to Christ, to find a breath, Jesus the best my destiny, no power of man, no sleep of man,
[time=131] can never walk without His name."
[time=139] "You keep returns or calls me poor, shear in the power of Christ as they are."
[time=169] It's really good to be here with you, so thankful for the morning.
[time=181] Would you in honor of God's Word, would you stand quietly and allow me to read for you this morning the account of the resurrection from John chapter 20?
[time=192] If you've got your Bibles, why don't you open up and follow along?
[time=196] If you don't, maybe you can look on with someone or follow along on the screen.
[time=200] My friends, it says in John 20 verse 1, "Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb, where it was still dark, and saw the stone already taken away
[time=209] from the tomb.
[time=210] So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him." So Peter and the other disciple, who in this case is John, who's writing this.
[time=226] So Peter and the other disciple went forth, and they were going to the tomb.
[time=230] The two were running together, and the other disciple John ran ahead faster than Peter
[time=237] and came to the tomb first, and stooping and looking in.
[time=242] John saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in.
[time=247] John the cautious one, but here comes Peter.
[time=253] And so Simon Peter also came following him, and in classic Peter fashion goes right on
[time=259] in, and entered the tomb, and he saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the face cloth, which had been on his head, on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled
[time=270] up.
[time=271] Amazing, huh?
[time=273] It rolled up in a place by itself, so the other disciple who had first come to the tomb, then
[time=279] also entered, and he saw and say it out loud.
[time=286] For as yet, think about this, all the things they'd seen, and if you ever think you're
[time=292] a little slow, I mean if you ever struggle with being kind of, you know, they've taken
[time=298] you a while to kind of get it, you know, truth, you know, it's just amazing to read this after all they'd seen, for as yet they did not understand the scripture that he must
[time=309] rise again from the dead.
[time=312] So the disciples went away again to their homes, but Mary, Mary Magdalene was standing outside the tomb weeping.
[time=319] Don't forget about Mary.
[time=324] Mary Magdalene, weeping, don't forget about Mary Magdalene, a prostitute, a woman with
[time=335] a past, a woman who had given herself to and engaged in unspeakable and indecent acts,
[time=346] who had found in her Lord grace and forgiveness in a new life.
[time=355] So she misses him terribly, she's weeping, and so as she wept, she stooped and looked
[time=361] into the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet
[time=367] where the body of Jesus had been lying, and they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him." When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there and did not know
[time=383] it was Jesus.
[time=385] Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?
[time=389] Whom are you seeking?" And supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away." And Jesus said to her, "I love this," what did he say?
[time=401] He called her, "What?" he just said, "Mary, have you ever had that feeling of being called
[time=410] by one who loved you?" Maybe it was a mom, maybe it was a dad, maybe a grandmother, grandfather, good friend, just, can you hear it?
[time=417] Can you hear them saying your name, the comfort that that brings?
[time=421] He said to her, "Mary," she turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Robonai," which means teacher.
[time=427] Jesus said to her, "Stop clinging to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father." But go to my brethren and say to them, "I ascend to my Father and your Father and my God and your God." And Mary Magdalene came announcing to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord," and that he had said these things to her.
[time=444] And then you come to verse 19 through 25, which is basically Christ appearing to the disciples with Thomas absent.
[time=453] Everybody's there except Thomas, and he appears and they see him and he interacts with them, but Thomas hadn't seen it, and he says at the end of 25, "I will not, I will not believe,"
[time=467] and we'll pick it up in 26.
[time=468] So after eight days, his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them, and Jesus came,
[time=475] the door is having been shut and stood in their midst and said, "Peace be with you," then he said to Thomas, "Reach here with your finger and see my hands, and reach here with
[time=485] your hand and put it into my side and do not be unbelieving but say it out loud."
[time=493] Thomas answered and said to him, "My Lord, I love this, in him the fullness of deity dwelt, my Lord and my what?
[time=501] My God." And Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed."
[time=509] And this stings a little bit, but boy, this is powerful.
[time=513] Because you have believed, because you have seen me, you have believed, blessed are they who did not see me, and yet what, say it out loud.
[time=523] I love 30 and 31, therefore many other signs.
[time=527] Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book,
[time=533] not written here in the Gospel of John, but these things have been written.
[time=538] What is here in the Gospel of John, John says in 31, but these have been written so that you may say it out loud, believe, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing
[time=551] and that in your believing, you may have what, life, real, real, and we're not just talking
[time=562] breathing people.
[time=564] These things have been written so that you may believe, and that in believing these things, the Gospel, that Jesus, born of a virgin, came, lived this perfect life, was tortured, beaten, crucified on your behalf.
[time=576] In his substitutionary death for you, and in his resurrection, he provides a way for you to not only have the forgiveness of sin and meaning and purpose in life today, but an eternity with God in the future.
[time=588] When you believe that, he says you get life.
[time=595] Life in his name.
[time=597] Dear God, we stand before you this morning so thankful for this life, not just breathing and not just existing, but God, as Paul said in the Epistle's life, that is truly life.
[time=609] Real life.
[time=612] God, thank you for the privilege of celebrating this life.
[time=616] Thank you for the privilege of looking into this great truth of what you've provided us through the resurrection of your Son.
[time=623] God, as we celebrate it this morning, as we continue to be reminded of its great impact in our lives, oh, God, may it do that, may it impact our lives truly, really.
[time=635] May it have an effect on how we think and live and choose.
[time=641] That is our prayer and our hope.
[time=642] Thank you for the privilege to give ourselves to this study this morning in your Son's name we pray.
[time=648] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=650] My friends, the great truth of the resurrection is that God, like the song says, and we've been singing that song for several weeks now and it has been such a blessing and so fun
[time=661] for us to teach it to you and to hear you sing it week after week, the great truth of the resurrection, my friends, is that God has made a way.
[time=672] God has made a way.
[time=675] As the song says there in its chorus, he tore the veil.
[time=678] I told you about that a couple of weeks ago, there was a veil in the temple.
[time=682] It was enormous.
[time=683] It was huge and it was a veil that in essence kept the high priest, it kept everybody.
[time=690] The high priest could go through the veil into the holy of holies, the most intimate place of meeting with God and the veil was what separated the everybodies of this world,
[time=702] the you and the mise from the presence of God, the high priest once a year could go in,
[time=709] make sacrifices.
[time=710] Says there when the earth shook, when Jesus whispers it's finished there and the cross, the veil is torn from the top to the bottom.
[time=718] God tears the veil, opening wide open a path away for you and for me to experience intimacy
[time=727] in the holy of holies.
[time=729] We've talked about it the last several weeks in our I'm a priest series.
[time=732] We've talked about the privilege you and I have as believers to draw near to God really, really near, intimately near, made possible because he made a way, a way for you to, I
[time=747] love the phrase in John 20, a way for you to have a life.
[time=751] You hear folks say sometimes they get a life, well here's a life.
[time=756] Here's the greatest life of all, here's the most meaningful, fulfilling, satisfying life
[time=763] anybody can have, life in Christ.
[time=766] These things have been written, verse 31, John 20, these things have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ and that in your believing, you may, in your
[time=776] believing, in your believing, my friends, not the word here, believe, not mental assent.
[time=783] It's not just a nodding of the head.
[time=784] It's not just a casual, yeah, okay, whatever, it's not just a, yeah, I've known that since I was five.
[time=790] No, this is not just a mental nodding of the head, a mental assent, no, this is a deep
[time=796] inward from the very gut, the very furthest part, the core of your being faced down before
[time=803] God saying, I give up, I believe your God and I'm not and I surrender myself, my hopes
[time=809] and my dreams and my life and my actions and my family and my future.
[time=813] I give it all to you, I believe that this is true and that in believing, he says, when
[time=823] you're willing to do that, he says you get life, all you get life.
[time=829] The great truth of the resurrection is that he made a way.
[time=833] Now the great realization that every honest human being comes to, every honest man in
[time=839] this room, every honest woman in this room, every individual who's willing to look at the reality of life, how it goes, who we are, how we're wired, how this thing plays
[time=849] out again and again and again, every single time doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, every honest individual in the room, every one of you listening to the broadcast,
[time=861] everybody listening online, everybody who's honest comes to the realization that left to ourselves, there is no way, none, no way.
[time=878] Great truth of the resurrection is that he has made a way.
[time=881] The great realization of every honest person in this room is that left to ourselves, there is absolutely no way, no possible way to have meaning in life, no possible way to have peace
[time=895] in our souls, no way whatsoever for you and I to experience the forgiveness of sin.
[time=902] We are, we are, we were without Christ, without hope.
[time=907] Look at Ephesians, open your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 2, 2 Corinthians then it goes to Galatians
[time=914] Ephesians 2, Ephesians 2, 12, explains in graphic detail, Ephesians 1, excuse me, the
[time=921] first part of Ephesians 2 explains in graphic detail, our state, our condition, outside
[time=928] of relationship with the Lord.
[time=930] It goes on in verse, I want you to look at verse 12 though, Ephesians 2, 12, talking about our condition without him, left to ourselves, right?
[time=940] Remember, he says verse 12, remember that you were at that time separate from Christ,
[time=947] separated from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, don't let that, don't let that
[time=955] phrase confuse you, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, all that to say basically is that
[time=961] the people of Israel were a people of God's own possession, they were his chosen race, they were blessed, separate from Christ, you don't have that blessing, separate from Christ,
[time=972] you don't have that relationship with him, separate from him, you are separated, you are excluded from the commonwealth and you are strangers to the covenants of promise, having
[time=983] no hope and without God in the world, how are you doing?
[time=990] Not so good, but, but now, in Christ, Jesus, you were, you who were formerly far off.
[time=1006] Have been brought near, Kohan, remember Kohan, the word for priest, the one who draws near,
[time=1018] made possible only by what God did through his son, the ability to experience real lasting,
[time=1027] meaningful intimacy with God.
[time=1032] You were far off, you were gone, you were lost, you were without hope, you were excluded,
[time=1038] you were separated, but now in Christ Jesus, you who were formerly far off have been brought
[time=1047] near by the what, by the blood of Christ, left to ourselves no way out, none, but, but
[time=1057] then God, who has always, if you're part of the Blackhawk family and you've been around for a couple of months, you know the answer to this, God, who has always been about from the very beginning of this book all the way to the end, he has always been about one thing, he has always been about wanting to have what, relationship with his creation, and so this
[time=1077] God, who has always been about relationship, while we in and of ourselves, had absolutely
[time=1083] no way he makes a way, he makes a way, he provides the sacrifice of good Friday and
[time=1090] the miracle of the Sunday morning resurrection, Ephesians 2, 4 through 6, just go over the
[time=1096] side of your page there, Ephesians 2, 4 to 6, but God being rich in mercy, I love this,
[time=1102] but God being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead, don't forget that, flatlined, not scrambling to get in the boat, not struggling
[time=1118] to get to the life preserver, right, dead, bottom, gone, no pulse, history, scionara,
[time=1132] goodbye, dead, made us alive together with Christ by grace you have been saved, and look
[time=1141] at this, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ and raised
[time=1147] us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly places, I want to show you two great
[time=1156] truths about this life that he has given you, this life provided you and I through the resurrection,
[time=1163] I want to show you two great truths this morning, kind of a side note, as we make our way through those two great truths about resurrection life and it being offered to you and to me, side
[time=1175] note, as I want you to see as we go through this, something that some of you in the room, I think maybe are familiar with, for others of you it might be a really new learning, and I'm telling you what, it's a very, very important truth to be able to put your arms
[time=1189] around, the scriptures are very clear, and here in Ephesians 2 we begin to see this
[time=1195] played out and we'll see it played out in several other passages that we'll go to, you, the Bible teaches, here it is, side point, you as a believer, any of you in this room
[time=1206] who have fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, the scriptures teach that you participated in his death, that you participated on the cross, that you participated in his
[time=1222] being raised from the dead, the scriptures teach that not only did he do that for you, he did that in essence with you.
[time=1230] Now literally he was there, literally I know you and I were, but figuratively and spiritually
[time=1236] speaking the Bible goes to great lengths to remind you that what took place here, that which we celebrate this morning, it happened to you, and that should make a difference,
[time=1248] my friends, in the way you view it, and that should make a difference in the way we respond to it, even when we were dead in our transgressions he made us alive together with Christ and
[time=1261] raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places, participation.
[time=1270] You and I there, okay I want you to see two great truths, there's 50, but I want you just
[time=1278] to think about two this morning as we make our way through several passages, two things this morning that the scriptures clearly, clearly connect to this resurrected life that
[time=1290] he allows you and I to live, say it this way, in the resurrection, just write this down, in the resurrection he made a way, we've established that, in the resurrection he made a way for
[time=1303] you to have a life, and I want to just give you a couple of things here that the scriptures are so clear about, as it talks about this life that you and I get to experience as we've been raised up with Christ, number one is this, in the resurrection he made a way for
[time=1320] you to have a life, according to the scriptures, a life free from the power of sin, and I'll
[time=1327] let you just look at that for a moment, how many of you in the room, you don't have to raise your hand, how many of you in the room, I don't care if you've seen that phrase on
[time=1336] a screen 50 times, or if this is the first time you've seen it, but I wonder how many of you in the room this morning are really interested, encouraged by the thought of that,
[time=1351] to live a life, freed from the power of sin, many of you in the room this morning, myself
[time=1360] included, have lived life under the power of sin, oh what a great truth, and what great
[time=1371] cause for rejoicing to think about, that in the resurrection, and you and I being raised up with him, he gives us the privilege of living a life freed from the power of sin,
[time=1383] what a great, great passage to look at, Romans 6, 1 to 7, turn there would you, right after
[time=1389] the book of Acts, comes the book of Romans, Paul's letter to the church there at Rome, chapter 6 verse 1, in chapter 5 he has talked at length about God's willingness to, by grace
[time=1402] and with his mercy, cover our sin, and then in verse 1 of chapter 6 he begins, what shall
[time=1409] we say then?
[time=1411] Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase, I mean that was the thought on some people's mind, if in fact I'm covered, if in fact God's grace is sufficient, if in fact his mercy and forgiveness has been there, is here and will always be here for me, then how about I just go do what I want to do, how about if I just go live, however I want to live, how about if I just go sin my head off, knowing that it's all going to get covered,
[time=1438] is that how this is supposed to work, he's kind of asking the question rhetorically and he says may it never be, in other words you've got to be kidding me, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[time=1451] no, watch, watch, here we go, how shall we, here comes the participation, watch this, how shall we who died to sin still live in it, or do you not know that all of us have
[time=1463] been baptized into Christ Jesus, that's talking about when you and I entered into that life-changing
[time=1470] relationship with him, it's talking about full surrender, or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into his death, therefore
[time=1481] we have been buried with him through baptism into death so that as Christ was raised from
[time=1488] the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too were raised, so we too might walk
[time=1495] in, say it out loud, newness of life.
[time=1501] For if we have become united, he says for if, what's implied there is we have, for if
[time=1507] in fact we have become and we have become united with him in the likeness of his death,
[time=1514] you died with him, in other words, certainly we shall also be united with him in the lightness
[time=1520] of his resurrection, knowing this that our, here's the bottom line my friends, 6 and 7,
[time=1526] knowing this that our old self was crucified with him, reminds me of Galatians 2, 20, for
[time=1532] I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who lives, but Christ lives in
[time=1539] me and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved
[time=1546] me and delivered himself up for me, knowing this that our old self, our sinful self,
[time=1553] our fleshly self was crucified with him in order that our body of sin, your body of sin,
[time=1561] my body of sin, all of your sins, your sins past, your sins present, your sins future,
[time=1567] all of the ugly dark habits, all the things that nobody knows about, everything about
[time=1573] your body of sin, your mind and your members and everywhere you've gone and all that's
[time=1579] been said and the decisions that got made in order that our body of sin might be done
[time=1588] away with so that we would no longer be slaves to sin, does a slave have a choice?
[time=1597] Yes or no? No. Slave is bound. No choice. No option. And what Christ has done, listen,
[time=1607] what Christ has done and what you experienced with Christ in his death and in his resurrection
[time=1614] now frees you, I love verse 7, for he who has died is freed from sin, freed from sin, died
[time=1625] to sin, look at 1 Peter 2, 24, I believe it'll come on the screen, 1 Peter 2, 24 says and he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to sin and live
[time=1637] to righteousness. We were there. We experienced it and in what he did on our behalf, you and
[time=1649] I now as believers have the privilege of walking in the newness of life. I love my Bible down
[time=1655] at the bottom in the note here, it says, man, somebody throw me some glasses. This is getting
[time=1665] bad. I'm going to have to talk to somebody. Newness of life, listen to this, this is true,
[time=1672] this newness of life, this is true if in Christ we died and we're buried with him, we have
[time=1678] also been united with him in his resurrection. There is a new quality to our life, a new
[time=1685] character to our life, a new principle by which we live by. This speaks of the believers
[time=1691] regeneration. We're new. We're not who we used to be. And you say, well, but gosh, Kelly,
[time=1700] sometimes I really feel like I am and I don't feel free at all from sin. What's going on here? Let me say it to you this way. This is true. You may not get it. You also may not
[time=1719] be giving yourself to it in the way that God would desire you and I to give ourselves
[time=1725] to this new way of thinking and this new way of living. I'll tell you this, crude illustration,
[time=1731] you just bear with me on this. It's what comes to a guy like me's mind, but let me just say
[time=1737] it to you this way, living free of the power of sin. And I want to just remind you spiritually
[time=1743] speaking how much of this takes place. You and I living this way. So much of it, my friends,
[time=1750] takes place right here. I know we have to live it out here, but so much of it happens
[time=1756] right here. So much of it, Proverbs 23, says, as a man, thinketh in his heart, so is he.
[time=1763] I said that kind of fast. Let me just say it slower to you. As a man, thinketh in his heart about himself. So is he. I was in ninth grade. And I loved to play basketball and
[time=1779] played a lot growing up. And as I got into high school, I never forget a summer camp.
[time=1783] So I went to at Stanford. We lived out in California and I went to the Stanford basketball summer
[time=1789] camp. And halfway through the week, I'm in there early one afternoon shooting. And there
[time=1796] were a lot of things, you know, in ninth grade, there were a lot of things through high school and college. I didn't do that well. In basketball, one thing I always did well was I always shot
[time=1805] the ball really well. I was like, I had a great shot. I did. I was a really, really good shooter.
[time=1814] It was uncanny. I mean, I worked at it a lot, but I could absolutely. It's kind of fun standing here talking about it at 44. I couldn't light it up. It was just, it was fun. And I
[time=1828] remember a coach from the camp coming in that day and talking to me about my shot. He says, hey, you got a great shot. I said, thanks. He said, what do you think about your shot?
[time=1838] I'll never forget this. I said, what do you mean? He said, well, I've been watching you, you know, warming up here and I've been watching you during the camp. And I just was wondering, when you get into a game, what do you think about your shot? And I said to him, I remember saying to him, well, what I think is I hope it goes in. I hope it goes
[time=1857] in. And he said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen to me. And he sat me down and just bear with me here. He sits me down, ninth grade, and he says to me, listen, you have a great shot. You are a great shooter. True? I said, yeah. He said, but yet you walk into
[time=1876] a game and you hope. You're a great shooter. You're a great shooter, right? I said, yeah.
[time=1884] But you walk into a game and you hope? No, no, no, no, no, no. You walk into a game and you know. And that might sound to you like just athletic hype and, okay, but I'm just
[time=1895] telling you, I'm telling you, it's true. And there's a lot of lessons that we could help
[time=1902] our young people with in terms of how they think and how they process and how they approach whether it's basketball or any component of life. Athletics, very true. Anybody want
[time=1915] to bet against Tiger today? Hands? There's somebody who has mentally come to grips with
[time=1923] and determined in his mind what he is and what he's going to do. My point is simply this, my friends, you have been freed from the power of sin. Freed, the spirit of God
[time=1936] that resides in you, the Word of God that you take in and surround your heart and mind with, the people of God who you live in community with, offering accountability and prayers and support, Word of God and the spirit of God that resides in you has empowered you
[time=1952] to walk into you. Name it. Go ahead. What is it? Having a drink? Clicking on a website?
[time=1958] Yelling at your kids? Name the sin. And I know there are times because I live where you
[time=1964] live where it feels like there's nothing else you can do but but the fact of the matter is that this life that he's given you, this resurrection life made available to you and I, in that life he has freed you from the power of that sin. It does not have dominion
[time=1980] over you and you and I can not because of ourselves but because of Christ in us choose to walk the other way because it's not who we are. We're shooters. Amen? Ezekiel 36.
[time=1998] I love it. Ezekiel 36, 25 and 27 says this, "Then I will sprinkle clean water on you
[time=2005] and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your
[time=2013] idols." Goes on in verse 26 to say, "Moreover I will give you a new heart." Who in the room
[time=2019] needed a new heart? Raise your hand. Who in the room needed to be cleansed from filthiness?
[time=2023] Raise your hand and put a new spirit within you and I will remove the heart of stone from
[time=2029] your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. It says in verse 27, "I will put my spirit within
[time=2035] you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you will be careful to observe my ordinances.
[time=2042] And you and I on a regular, daily, faithful, consistent basis are giving ourselves to drawing
[time=2049] near when the Word of God is surrounding and enveloping us, when the people of God live
[time=2055] in close relationship with us, holding us accountable, praying for us literally at times if need be walking through life with us." The Word of God and the Spirit of God and the
[time=2068] people of God, we are encouraged and we are energized and we are made ready by God to
[time=2074] make decisions that are free from sin's power. In the resurrection he made a way for you to
[time=2082] have a life freed from the power of sin. In the resurrection my friends, because you and
[time=2089] I participated in this with him, he has made a way for you to have a life. Number two, write this down, marked by eternal pursuits, marked by eternal pursuits. My friends, this resurrection
[time=2104] life that he makes available to you in relationship with him is a life that can be characterized by new pursuits, by meaningful pursuits, God honoring pursuits. Look at Colossians
[time=2116] 3, go back to Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Colossians chapter 3, therefore
[time=2123] Paul says to the Church of Colossae, therefore if you have been, and he's again implying that you have been, therefore if you have been and you have been raised up, there it is again the participation, raised up with Christ. If that's true and you're in relationship
[time=2140] with him and you got raised up from the dead with him, then keep seeking the things where.
[time=2146] Say it above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God, set your mind, your direction,
[time=2157] your pursuits, your perspective, the stuff that you're about, the things that you're after, set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth for you
[time=2169] have verse 3, for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. I can't remember
[time=2177] who said it, maybe somebody in the room will recognize the quote and you can tell me later.
[time=2184] If I could remember, I'd tell you, I just can't. It was an author who wrote about the boy and it's just, it's just like the boy who grew up this idea of our perspective and
[time=2196] where we're aiming. It's just like the boy who grew up in the ghetto who in the heat
[time=2204] of a summer day delights as he plays with a toy boat in a puddle because he's never
[time=2215] seen nor experienced the joy of the ocean. Never seen the ocean. There's no idea what
[time=2224] an ocean is. Just know he likes the puddle. But boy, if he could just see, if he could
[time=2230] just see the ocean. Well, you know what? You've seen the ocean. You've tasted of the goodness
[time=2240] of God. God has in Christ as you've died and been raised with him. He gives you now the
[time=2247] opportunity to be about, to have minds and lives that are set on things above. Noble
[time=2253] pursuits. Eternal pursuits. I mean, really, really important stuff, people. You and I get
[time=2260] to be in this resurrection life given to those kinds of things. I wrote some down. I wrote
[time=2267] down some of the most eternal, most significant. I wrote down the most meaningful pursuits
[time=2274] I could think of. I'm talking kingdom stuff. I'm talking to things that really matter.
[time=2279] I'm talking about the things that would have an impact on lives for years and years and years to come. I wrote them all down here. And I'll just tell you, net worth, number of
[time=2291] homes, who you're dating, how popular you are, where you're going to go to college, didn't
[time=2301] make the list. Here's a few that did. Meaningful. I'm talking significant. You're somebody.
[time=2313] If you're, if you've got your mind set on these things. Number one, a man who loves his wife. There you go. A man today who loves his wife, a man who sacrifices for his wife.
[time=2331] A man who pursues his wife. A man who prioritizes his wife. A man who loves his wife when his
[time=2342] wife's hard to love. Any ladies want to raise your own? Never mind. Don't do that. You want
[time=2349] to, you want to pursue something noble? You want to go after something significant? Love
[time=2358] your wife well. You want to go after something noble and enormous and something really, really
[time=2367] important? Honor your husband. Ephesians five, it is for a man to love his wife and for a
[time=2373] wife to respect her husband. Honor. You know what? You know what's noble today? A wife who honors her husband. It doesn't talk bad about him. Who gives him the benefit of the
[time=2383] doubt? A lot? Who supports and encourages when there are plenty of things to be unsupportive
[time=2393] of and frustrated by a wife who honors her husband, who speaks well of him, who cheers
[time=2401] for him from the side, believing in his ability to do what he's trying to do. She saves criticism
[time=2410] and hard words for private and communicates those with respect. The most significant,
[time=2421] the most meaningful and eternal endeavors. Here's one loving and leading and investing in a family. Talk about significant training up and preparing a future generation beginning
[time=2433] with those that sleep in beds in your home, your children. Do you realize how significant
[time=2440] and eternal it is to make a positive, spiritually lasting influence on your family? You know,
[time=2447] I bump into people often who will ask me about my pursuits. They'll ask me about my dreams.
[time=2452] They'll ask me about what I've got my mind or my eyes set on. There will be people. I think maybe because I do what I do, maybe because the size of our church, maybe because
[time=2462] they think, you know, I'm a TV guy, whatever it is, sometimes they talk to me and say, hey, what are you going after? What are your dreams? Where do you want to go with all
[time=2471] this? What do you want this to become? And see, they don't understand me. They don't
[time=2482] know me. And then I try to, you know, in a brief conversation, I'll oftentimes try to let them kind of understand that my -- and most of you know this, some of you may not,
[time=2492] you know, my grandfather, excuse me, you know, my great grandfather committed adultery and
[time=2501] blew up his family, gone. My grandfather committed adultery, blew up his family. He's
[time=2514] gone. Just shreds everywhere, horrific. My dad committed adultery, blew up the family,
[time=2526] and we're working to try and put some of that back together these days. You want to talk
[time=2532] about my pursuits? Want to know how big and lofty my dreams are? I want to stay married.
[time=2543] I want to have a family picture when I'm 70 with everybody in it. It's about it. What
[time=2552] he does with -- what he does with this, what he does with this, other opportunities that
[time=2560] may come, whatever. You and I have the opportunity to be given to things that matter and things
[time=2568] that last. And I would encourage you this morning to be about really noble endeavors. I want
[time=2578] to have three friends come up if I can real quick. We'll go a little bit late today, but it's Easter, so what are you going to do? Be mad at me. I'd like to have my three friends
[time=2588] join me, Keith and Ira and Michael. And these are guys I'm so thankful for. They have grown
[time=2596] to mean a lot to me personally. And I want to just -- you may be sitting here this morning and you may be thinking, you know what, Kelly? Okay. So he made a way. You're going to take
[time=2607] this, Dino. You might be sitting here this morning thinking, okay, hey, guys, good to
[time=2615] see you. Come on over here, pastor. You might be sitting here thinking this. You might be thinking, okay, okay, okay. So he made a way for you. You might be sitting here or you might be watching the broadcast or listening online thinking, you know what, but he can't make a way for me because you don't know where I've been and you don't know what I face.
[time=2634] He may have made a way for you, Kelly, but I don't know that he could make a way for me. Well, I want to remind you this morning, not just me, but with three guys who I love
[time=2644] and who God's allowed me the privilege of getting to know, I want you just to hear it from them briefly how God made a way and is making a way. Real life stuff. Keith, more
[time=2656] on our staff here. Keith is a young 83 almost. Is that right? That's right. 83 years old.
[time=2665] Tell them how long you've been married coming up here. Just give them that one. 58 years at August. 58 years in August. He's a young, he's a young 83, married 58 years in August
[time=2678] in ministry for 54 years. 54 years in ministry. Seven kids, 27 grandchildren, five great grandchildren.
[time=2690] And here's the thing I want to tell you is that Keith is a friend of mine. We're in a small group together. It's so cool to have old people. I can call you old, right? Yeah,
[time=2700] sure. We can go long on Easter and I can call him old. All right? It's so, it's so, if you
[time=2706] are in a small group and you don't have old, wise people, you should go get some. I'm telling
[time=2713] you, it's a blessing. And he has shared with our group and he has shared with me personally that in all those years, you might hear all those statistics and think, oh, wow, Keith, a little circle around his head up here, you know? No, no. He's talked about his failures.
[time=2728] He's talked about his mistakes. He's talked about the challenges he had as a dad, as a dad. But what has been the constant through it all? Tell the folks as you think back on all that. What's been the constant? Well, the faithfulness of God. I began my ministry in January of 1953. I was a student pastor at $35 a week. And we had two children. And
[time=2750] God blessed in that ministry. And then I moved to the next church for 18 years where we pastored and God was so good there. You know, pastor, I think about that, staying 18 years
[time=2761] in one place. And that's where our children grew up and how that church prayed for our family. Didn't criticize us, but prayed for us and was such a blessing. In fact, there's
[time=2772] a member here that was a member of that church. And that's Laurie Whitman who was Laurie Caddis
[time=2778] at that time. Her dad was my youth pastor. And then we left that church. I've been in
[time=2784] two pastorates with parsonages. And I had no equity. And the next church had no parsonage.
[time=2792] But the kind people in that church said, we'll provide for you a parsonage. And they loaned
[time=2798] me $10,000 interest free to buy a home. And God provided all the way. There were difficulties,
[time=2806] hardships, but God was so faithful. And then I remember how I prayed for a wife. I was
[time=2813] serving the Lord up in Bar Harbor, Maine in 1947. And I prayed, God lead me to somebody.
[time=2821] And that fall, I met my wife. And that was in August of 1947. And I, it was hard. She
[time=2830] was a beautiful lady. And I talked to her about, and she said, well, she felt called the children's ministry. Well, I said, I can help you. So we had seven children. She served
[time=2843] the Lord. So God has been good all the way. And we praise Him for His faith. We've been
[time=2849] hardships and difficulties. But He's been there. He's a faithful one. And I praise God
[time=2856] from my dear wife who served with me all of those years.
[time=2860] So I want you to just think about this for a moment. God makes a way. And those of you in the room, you know, looking at what you've got ahead of you. The challenge is that you know you're going to face. Remember, remember this morning, God made a way in this case
[time=2875] through His faithfulness, His faithfulness to provide and lead and guide. He is a faithful
[time=2881] God. He makes a way through His faithfulness. This is my friend, Irake. Irake and I are also in a small group together. We meet on Wednesday nights. It's a great, great group of guys. And we're growing to love and care for each other as the days go by. Irake and
[time=2896] I, not only are we just friends because we're loving each other and spending time together.
[time=2901] We have a similar background in terms of just challenges that we've been through as young men with our dads. And I know in Irake's situation that that challenge and others that he went
[time=2912] through left him as a young man. And I think he'd be okay with me saying to you this morning
[time=2918] he was as a young man. He wasn't in good shape. There was a heart that had grown very bitter.
[time=2924] There was a heart that had grown very hard. There was an anger toward a dad and an anger and a confusion toward God. And what we ended up with was a young man who was in trouble
[time=2935] at times with the law, in trouble at times with people, in places doing things, engaged in stuff that was just not at all what you'd want to be engaged in. Am I being accurate
[time=2947] there? Tell the folks a little bit about what that was like for you as a young man, what you were into. And then I just want you to share with them how he softened that heart,
[time=2958] how he did that. Well, just a little bit of dirty laundry. At 17 years of age, I think
[time=2967] I was 17. My goal was to have the majority of drugs be mine. The possession, there are
[time=2983] a lot of illegal things that happened in Fort Wayne. And I wanted to be the man that ran
[time=2990] it all at 17. So that happened after my father left as a pastor. And what it did was it left
[time=3003] me confused, very angry. And I felt like I wanted revenge at God. So I said if that's
[time=3010] the way God is to take my father away. And a lot of my anger came from the way that my
[time=3016] father left my mom. I saw my mom cry, combing her hair, clumps her hair coming out from
[time=3022] stress and depression. And my sister went away to college. And I was the one who lived
[time=3030] in a small little house, the only house that we could afford at that time with my mom alone
[time=3037] lived working three jobs. So the anger came from just watching her a person that I cared
[time=3043] about. And just really, really, if that's the way God was, I didn't want anything to
[time=3051] do with him. So I pulled away from him, set my goals and chased after him. And in that
[time=3058] life came a lot of stuff that we won't air here today. But that was the nutshell of what
[time=3067] happened.
[time=3068] What did you do to get your back? How did he make a way? How did he soften your heart?
[time=3071] Well, my mom grew closer to God in that time as I pulled away. She grew closer to God. And
[time=3081] every Sunday she would come to my bedroom, knock on the door and ask me, was I going to church and I would tell her no. Was it interested? And she never forced me, which worked out good for me. So she called tons of pastors and I literally mean tons of pastors. She looked
[time=3097] in a phone book called every pastor she knew. And because of the nasty taste in a lot of pastors mouth around the town, they didn't want to get involved in a whole divorce and
[time=3108] adultery and all that stuff from my family. So a lot of them just said they didn't have time. Some of them said they would come, never showed up. And probably two of them showed up. And one I scared scared off just with my anger, with my story threatening him. And
[time=3124] he never, never came back and another one actually shared his story with me who's probably worst
[time=3130] in mind. And that's what did it. And I've felt at that time in his office, if God could
[time=3137] save him, God could save me. Wow. Wow. So God makes a way through his faithfulness. God
[time=3143] makes a way through the ministry of others that he uses to soften hearts and completely
[time=3150] transform a life. This is my friend Mike. Hey, buddy. Good to see you, man. Mike's a little
[time=3158] nervous. Mike's become a good friend. And he always tells me, hey, well, first of all,
[time=3165] tell them where you're from so they can, because I was just about to imitate your voice, but they've got to hear your voice before they understand my imitation of it. Tell them your name and where you're from. My name is Mike Sullivan. I'm from the Bronx, New York City.
[time=3176] All right. So Mike's from the Bronx. And he's always said, hey, hey, whatever you need
[time=3184] me to do, I'll do. So I asked him if he'd come help me today. And man, you clean up well.
[time=3191] Here's the good friend. We've got a real quick here. I want to just have you hear this. God's and Mike would be the first to tell you this. And I love it about him. He's honest. Mike would tell you God's making a way. Michael would tell you that he's in process. He's
[time=3210] getting there. And what I've seen in Mike is a lifetime growing up in the Bronx where
[time=3220] he got involved in a lot of things that, you know, kids in the Bronx get involved in.
[time=3225] He was lonely, had some struggles in his family, got involved with people that you'd want to
[time=3231] normally stay away from. It led him to a life that was about Mike that led him to a life of pursuing things that were dangerous, detrimental and unhealthy. He was a mess. Is that fair
[time=3246] to say? Yeah. Yeah. So I want Mike to tell you. Here's what I want Mike to tell you. Tell
[time=3253] him, tell him how you got to Fort Wayne and then just tell him about Black Hawk and art.
[time=3258] Yeah. Just those three things we talked about. I want you to see how God has made a way for a kid from the Bronx who was really, really messed up to come to a point where he's making
[time=3268] his way. Go ahead. My first 30 days in Indiana, I spent them in a rehab. Life in New York
[time=3279] back in the 80s was most likely going to kill me. One way or the other. I was determined
[time=3286] to do what I wanted to do and be as selfish as I could be. I came up to Fort Wayne about
[time=3295] 16 years ago. I met Kelly about seven years ago. I had a lack of trust and faith in church.
[time=3304] I grew up under a different faith, we'll say, to mention that. So when I had heard about
[time=3310] Black Hawk, I went directly to Kelly to challenge him, to see if he was for real. I was very
[time=3319] nervous and apprehensive about getting involved with the church. The years that I've been here,
[time=3328] I still haven't listened to Kelly all the time. He told me to leave my coat open. I had a button. Kelly has stuck by me through thick and thin. At the end of the church services,
[time=3344] when Kelly says after church, if you'd like to come and speak to me, he really means that.
[time=3351] He will listen to you and he will make himself available for you and to you. Recently, I got involved in a men's group on Monday evenings. To just be quite honest with all of you, I've
[time=3365] not been that loyal with coming to church, but this group that I'm involved in has truly
[time=3376] been amazing. I would have been all money against me sticking with anything like that,
[time=3385] but these gentlemen have been real honest and faithful as well. They really care where
[time=3391] I grew up. Loyalty was everything and I placed it in the wrong things and the wrong people.
[time=3398] I wish to say I finally found a place to put my loyalty where it won't be taken advantage
[time=3405] of. These men have helped me to begin to grow. They've come beside me and alongside me.
[time=3413] They give nothing but good advice. It's very great to see that there's other people that
[time=3420] struggle like I do. That's good. God makes a way. He makes a way. He makes a way by being
[time=3433] faithful. He makes a way by softening a heart. He makes a way by patiently, faithfully bringing
[time=3441] people along. I'm watching Mike begin to care about others for the first time in his life.
[time=3447] He's starting to care about others. God makes a way. Would you stand quietly this morning?
[time=3452] We're going to just pray and go. Father, God, thank you so much for the privilege of being together this morning and thank you so very, very much for the love that you have for these
[time=3464] three men, for the love that you have for each and every person in this room. God, thank you so very much for your son and his resurrected life that we get the privilege of sharing
[time=3474] in. We love you, Father. We thank you for this time of celebration this morning and we look
[time=3480] forward to what you have for us in the days to come and your son's name we pray. Amen.
