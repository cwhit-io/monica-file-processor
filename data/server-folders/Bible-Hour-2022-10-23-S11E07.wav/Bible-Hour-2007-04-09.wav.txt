[time=89] >> Stephanie read a moment ago a passage she read from a passage.
[time=95] And in that passage, it talked about how we've been in Christ.
[time=100] It talked about how we've been made new, how the old self kind of is gone.
[time=105] And now there's a new you in Christ, it is the great truth of redemption.
[time=111] It's the great truth of his transforming work that whatever we were, wherever we'd been, whatever we had done, he has now made it new.
[time=120] And I want you just to think about this for a moment this morning.
[time=125] There's a lot of you in the room who I think will find this drama and it's very clear message.
[time=133] I believe many of you in the room.
[time=135] If not all of you will find it very applicable.
[time=138] Because here's the point.
[time=139] The point is that we have been all of us to some degree or another in the past defined, think about this, defined by what we've done.
[time=151] We get defined, people look at us.
[time=154] There are phrases and there are descriptions that get attached to us.
[time=160] Based upon what we've done, based upon circumstances.
[time=164] Now it may be based upon what we've done or you know what sometimes we get to find.
[time=168] People call us certain things, they label us certain things because of what others have done.
[time=174] Perpetrated upon us, either way, we live sometimes with this stigma and
[time=180] the great truth is that in Christ we are made new.
[time=184] I want you to be reminded of that.
[time=188] What you see behind me is our stage light drama team and they are going to kind of portray this great truth.
[time=196] The labels they've been given are simply for the purpose of this morning.
[time=200] But nonetheless, it's a very real exercise and a very real reminder of God's transforming, redeeming work.
[time=208] How am I defined?
[time=212] How are you defined?
[time=215] By what we've done.
[time=217] By what we've said.
[time=219] With whom we associate.
[time=222] By our innermost thoughts and memories.
[time=225] How we act when we're not alone.
[time=228] By how we look.
[time=229] By our successes and failures.
[time=234] By our health and well being.
[time=236] By our careers.
[time=239] By every bad decision we've ever made.
[time=248] How am I defined?
[time=253] I am defined by others.
[time=256] I am defined by myself.
[time=258] I am defined by my parents.
[time=260] I am defined by the church.
[time=262] I am defined by a judge.
[time=264] I am defined by my addiction.
[time=267] I am defined by my children.
[time=270] I am defined by my record.
[time=272] I am defined by a diagnosis.
[time=275] I am defined by a bank statement.
[time=278] I am defined by my shame.
[time=280] I had a couple of cocktails after work.
[time=287] I was selfish and controlling.
[time=292] I was always robbing Peter to pay Paul.
[time=295] I did the best I could with my rebellious son.
[time=299] I got fired again.
[time=304] I have made the stupidest mistakes.
[time=307] I took my first peek when I was 11.
[time=310] I had a boyfriend who said that he'd marry me some day.
[time=316] I had a series of meaningless affairs.
[time=320] I hid in the closet, but he always found me.
[time=324] I found a place where I finally belonged.
[time=328] I just couldn't take it anymore.
[time=332] This is how I'm defined.
[time=335] This is how you are defined.
[time=339] In the eyes of others.
[time=341] In the eyes of friends.
[time=344] In the eyes of man.
[time=345] Maybe I can hide it.
[time=348] Maybe they don't know my past.
[time=350] Maybe they won't see my scars.
[time=353] It was so long ago.
[time=356] It was so far away.
[time=357] It was so painful.
[time=360] It still is.
[time=362] I don't want to be defined by my past anymore.
[time=379] To live with this shame.
[time=383] To live with this scorn.
[time=385] I have given this sin up.
[time=388] I have laid it at the foot of the cross.
[time=391] I have been forgiven.
[time=393] And I'm not wearing it anymore.
[time=396] This is not how I am defined.
[time=405] In the eyes of my savior.
[time=407] I am forgiven.
[time=417] I am loved.
[time=418] I am sanctified.
[time=422] I am blessed.
[time=425] I am accepted.
[time=428] I am remembered.
[time=432] I am free.
[time=436] I am justified.
[time=438] I am righteous.
[time=441] I am adopted.
[time=446] I am changed.
[time=447] I am humbled.
[time=451] I am a new creation.
[time=470] I am not ashamed.
[time=472] I have been made perfect.
[time=474] I am filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=477] I am a living sacrifice.
[time=480] I have been marked in Him with a seal.
[time=482] I shine like a star in the universe.
[time=485] I was chosen before the creation of this world.
[time=488] I was dead in my transgressions and sins, but now I'm alive and Christ.
[time=493] I am blameless.
[time=496] I am holy.
[time=498] I have been redeemed.
[time=501] And I am born to start living like it.
[time=505] I will glory in my Redeemer.
[time=526] Whose priceless blood has ransom me?
[time=531] Mine was the sin that drove the bitterness
[time=537] and hung Him on that judgment tree.
[time=542] I will glory in my Redeemer who crushed the power of sin and death.
[time=552] My only Savior before the Holy Church.
[time=560] The Lamb who is my righteousness.
[time=578] I will glory in my Redeemer.
[time=583] My life He bought, my love He owns.
[time=588] I have no longings for another.
[time=594] I'm satisfied in Him alone.
[time=599] I will glory in my Redeemer.
[time=604] His faithfulness, my standing place.
[time=609] The holes are mighty and rush upon me.
[time=616] My feet are firm held by His grace.
[time=634] I will glory in my Redeemer.
[time=650] He carries me on evil swings He crowns my love with loving kindness.
[time=661] His triumphs song I'll ever see.
[time=666] I will glory in my Redeemer who waits for me and gates of gold.
[time=676] And when He calls me, it will be paradise.
[time=685] His faith forever to behold.
[time=703] I will glory in my Redeemer.
[time=719] This morning we want to, really in a sense,
[time=731] continue in a discussion that we've been in for many, many weeks.
[time=735] And here's the deal, you know, the pictures, all the "I'm a Priest" pictures are gone.
[time=740] And while in a sense, the series "I'm a Priest", this teaching that we've been engaged in on the priesthood of all believers, while it's Rick Hawks came a few weeks ago kind of brought a conclusion to it, we would, Mitchell would tell you, I would tell you, our leadership team would tell you that we're pretty convinced these days that the response to the series and the things that we continue to talk about, not only between us, but the conversations that we continue to have with so many of you, we're convinced that this series probably isn't going to end.
[time=771] And what I mean by that is it will probably be something for a long, long time that we talk about, that we'll come back and teach on, it will, I think, become hopefully more and more a part of who we are as a family.
[time=783] And while we have other things to move on to in the weeks to come, I wanted to just take some time this morning and Mitchell agreed to kind of help.
[time=790] We want to go back to the beginning of the, to the beginning of the priesthood series
[time=796] and hit on a, on a point that I think is a very, very important point to hit on.
[time=800] We didn't spend a whole lot of time talking about it, but we will.
[time=804] And then we're going to move on from here in the, in the weeks to come.
[time=807] But before we get to that, to that point that we want to hit on this morning, I just wanted to encourage you with Mitchell and I as we talked and as we talk as a staff, there are so many priestly stories floating around these days.
[time=820] Just so many of you, young ones, middle-aged, older folks, single folks, married folks, small group, Sunday school classes.
[time=828] There are so many people who seem to have kind of latched on to this idea of you being, by virtue of your relationship with Christ, because of Christ in you, you have this amazing privilege to minister, to be the church.
[time=843] And it's so encouraging for us to hear about them.
[time=846] I can think of just like one right off the bat that's been a huge encouragement to me, a mom, a mom at home. We've had kind of an ongoing email discussion and turns out in recent weeks that in her realization that she could be a priest at home, she has committed to completely revamp her entire day.
[time=865] She's got two little ones at home and she is completely redoing the way she comes at her day in an effort to better pass on to them. That's what priests do.
[time=874] They pass on God to others, right? She's trying to pass on God to her little ones, pass on his truth to them in more meaningful and practical ways.
[time=883] It's really cool. We have a friend here, Blackhawk, who has because of his desire to pass on God's compassion.
[time=890] Individual from our family right here who is starting a foundation, literally starting a foundation, and the foundation is going to in the weeks and months and years to come,
[time=901] be a ministry and a resource to those in the Biloxi area.
[time=906] In our ongoing efforts to try and bring the love and the compassion and the justice of God to those who so need it and will continue to need it in the days and weeks and years to come.
[time=917] Amazing stuff. Mitchell, some stories that come to your mind?
[time=920] I think of Val.
[time=925] Val doesn't know I'm going to do this unless you heard it first hour.
[time=930] I didn't see you up there. Val helped found, Val really founded, was a catalyst to Blackhawk's deaf ministry outreach.
[time=939] And she had a lot of people come alongside her.
[time=942] But what God did with Val is really, really cool.
[time=948] That's cool. Oh, I love that.
[time=950] It's really, really cool. Everybody do that. One, two, three.
[time=953] Cool.
[time=954] God took Val's ministry and her vocation and blended them together.
[time=962] And she's a speech therapist, and now she owns a business.
[time=965] She just started a business out of this passion for God, and she's a priest.
[time=969] Val is a speech therapist and helps deaf kids relate to their parents and also the converse of that.
[time=977] And just is busy, 168 hours a week, right? As a minister, I think of Verne.
[time=985] Verne turned 80 years old this week, right? Everybody say Happy Birthday to Verne?
[time=991] Happy Birthday Verne. Yeah, there we go.
[time=996] 80 years old, full head of hair, 41 years old, bald. I don't get it.
[time=1002] But Verne wakes up every morning and prays, "God, would you please use me to be Christ to somebody today?"
[time=1016] And when Verne shares a story like this at Common Ground, it usually begins with how he got gas at a cheaper price
[time=1024] or gets tanning for a buck-fifty lesson everybody else has.
[time=1027] So we've just affectionately called it discount evangelism.
[time=1031] Yes, you too can go get a discount on things that you purchase and evangelize at the same time.
[time=1036] But God answers that prayer daily, and it's amazing.
[time=1042] Justin, their normal walk of life as they are going, these two are priests.
[time=1048] That's important to distinguish there.
[time=1050] You can hear stories about somebody starting a foundation.
[time=1054] Or you can hear, I want to tell you, I'm so excited.
[time=1057] We just found out this last week, Brent was able to kind of get all the details finalized.
[time=1061] Brent Eymer, our global ministry's pastor, myself and Dave Walters, we're going to be able to go to Nairobi in June.
[time=1068] For just about four or five days, there is an orphanage that we've come across.
[time=1074] The orphanage there in Nairobi has eight satellite orphanages and they have a very, very special and unique calling.
[time=1081] There are over 300 babies in Kenya abandoned every, guess what, day.
[time=1094] 80% of those are infected or very possibly infected with the HIV virus.
[time=1100] And this orphanage there in Nairobi has developed a way in which these babies are being in incredible ways.
[time=1107] They're being retrieved and they're being brought in and you can go and you can provide.
[time=1112] They found out through injections and through proper nutrition and through, get this holding them.
[time=1119] Holding them and feeding them and working with the medical staff to give them proper immunization.
[time=1126] They've seen the HIV, the percentage of those little ones, newborns that develop HIV reduced by over 85%.
[time=1134] And we can send teams of eight and they can stay for about ten days.
[time=1141] And all you're going to do is you're going to minister to those people.
[time=1145] You're going to hold babies who are really, really little and really, really sick and feed them, help them get medical care.
[time=1152] And we get to go for about four days in June and kind of formalize this relationship with the orphanage.
[time=1159] Find out more about what that's going to look like so that you can.
[time=1162] Anybody want to go?
[time=1165] So that you can be global priests with the least of these.
[time=1171] We can talk about those kinds of things but I know a team of middle schoolers found out about them about two weeks ago.
[time=1177] Some middle school guys and girls who get together periodically to pick up trash in their neighborhood.
[time=1184] Where they live there's a bunch of it and they just get their plastic bags and they just go along and they pick up trash trying to pass along God's kindness.
[time=1191] It's an amazing picture from foundations and orphanages in Nairobi to moms at home trying to pass along truth.
[time=1199] You can be a priest.
[time=1202] But here's the deal.
[time=1204] I told you weeks ago when we first started this discussion that to be a priest, to be a cohan, you've heard me say it so many times now.
[time=1211] A cohan is one who draws what?
[time=1215] Say it again.
[time=1216] A priest is one who draws near.
[time=1221] And in the drawing near intimacy with God, in the drawing near we've said gets God all over them.
[time=1229] The relationship and the connection.
[time=1231] It's so real and it's so persistent and it's so meaningful that in the drawing near we get God all over us and then we get this opportunity to go and show others what God is like.
[time=1243] And we talk a lot about and it's so encouraging to hear stories about the ministry that takes place, the priestly ministry that gets fulfilled.
[time=1255] And as exciting as that is, Mitchell and I this morning we want to go back to the beginning because we haven't spent a whole lot of time practically talking about.
[time=1264] And then we're realizing as we go that we need to, many of you practically need to understand what does it mean, what does it look like to draw near to God?
[time=1276] How can you and I in the everyday of this life, in this world that we live in, with the schedules that we keep, the pace at which we move at?
[time=1284] How can we be people who draw near to God so we can be faithful cahons who then pass him along to others?
[time=1293] There is a pattern that we, Mitchell and I have looked at this.
[time=1297] There's a pattern we see in our Lord.
[time=1299] There always is.
[time=1301] There's this great example of Christ and he's going to read you a passage this morning that kind of captures this and we're going to talk about it this morning and we hope it will be really practically encouraged.
[time=1311] If you please stand and we'll read Luke 6 verses 12 through 19.
[time=1318] It was at this time that he went off to the mountain to pray and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
[time=1326] And when day came he called his disciples to him and chose 12 of them who he also named as Apostle Simon who he also named as Peter and Andrew as brother.
[time=1335] And James and John and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon who was called the zealot.
[time=1342] Judas the son of James and Judas Iscariot who became a traitor.
[time=1347] Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place and there was a large crowd of his disciples and a great throng of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.
[time=1361] And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured.
[time=1366] And all the people were trying to touch him for power was coming from him and healing them all.
[time=1374] Let's pray.
[time=1375] God we just pray as we open your word that your spirit who is alive and here right now would touch each person in his or her spirit.
[time=1388] And God that we would leave here changed.
[time=1392] Change to be more like you, change to be more like Christ, changed to be a priest wherever we are.
[time=1404] We pray these things in Jesus name.
[time=1406] [AMEN] You may be seated.
[time=1409] The question we'd really like to address today is twofold.
[time=1414] What are the two prerequisites to ministry?
[time=1425] And then what are practical applications for us to assimilate those two into our lives?
[time=1431] And the first one that we're going to see is solitude.
[time=1436] The second one is community and out of that intersection where solitude meets community flows the third which is ministry.
[time=1447] So what we see here in Jesus' life is that ministry is a byproduct of solitude with God and community with others.
[time=1456] And Kelly's going to talk about the solitude.
[time=1460] Solitude.
[time=1461] Would you write that down?
[time=1462] Maybe get out of pen and just right there on the note page, just write down solitude.
[time=1466] I want you to think about this with me.
[time=1467] I really want you to understand if we're going to be a place, if you are going to be a minister, if you're going to be a priestly part.
[time=1476] I'm the body of Christ fulfilling whatever calling and whatever opportunity he's placed you in.
[time=1482] If you're going to, as we talked about a couple of weeks ago, minister this place full.
[time=1487] You're going to reach a hurting world, a confused society that needs desperately to experience the impact of Christ followers like you and me.
[time=1499] It has got to begin with any effective ministry will begin with this thing called time alone with him.
[time=1509] In a busy, quick-paced life where you and I are doing all kinds of stuff, going all kinds of places with all kinds of responsibilities.
[time=1517] Morning, noon and night, you and I have got to come to a point where we are willing to slow down.
[time=1528] To stop, morning, noon, night, and be a people, be individuals.
[time=1545] Some of you right now are wishing I'd hurry up and make the point because you're so impatient.
[time=1554] And we're so prone to want to get on with what needs to be.
[time=1564] And you know what, my friends, we're going to miss it unless, as David said in the Psalms, we're people who are willing to be what?
[time=1571] To be still, which brings with it the clear implication of being quiet.
[time=1577] And in the being still, the Psalmist says, we can then know that he is God.
[time=1582] We can then understand what it is he has.
[time=1586] We can then begin to more clearly decipher what it is he wants us to do.
[time=1591] Time alone with God.
[time=1595] Time to listen, write these down, time to listen, time to pray, time to sing, write, meditate.
[time=1603] Time to surrender all over again, times of confession, adoration, times of praise, time alone.
[time=1613] You know what, it's something that I've learned in recent years from others.
[time=1619] It is not, and I won't ask you to raise your hand, but I think for many of us it's not our natural bent.
[time=1626] We're just not very good at it.
[time=1629] I have always, me personally, I have always, and I didn't realize this until I got older.
[time=1635] And I would be in conversations and we'd talk about this.
[time=1638] I didn't realize how my whole life I've avoided it.
[time=1642] I have always been on the move.
[time=1644] I have always been running my mouth.
[time=1646] I have always been talking.
[time=1648] I have always been with people.
[time=1650] There has always been, I didn't name it early on.
[time=1653] Tell them about in high school, if you could just stop talking for a minute please, and be quiet, I'm just joking.
[time=1660] Tell them about in high school where you had that challenge where you had to go in the mountains and be alone.
[time=1666] Oh, Sierra Trek.
[time=1669] Sierra Trek, that's right.
[time=1671] That's a very good point.
[time=1673] There was a time when I was, I was 16, and I went with a buddy who convinced me to go on this wilderness survival outing.
[time=1682] I was not a hiker, I was not a backpacker, I was a football player and basketball player, and I had this buddy who liked to hike and eat granola and all the stuff that those kind of folks do.
[time=1693] And I figured we could have some fun hiking, so we'd go for two, 14 days in the Trinity Alps in California.
[time=1700] There's actually Alps.
[time=1701] I didn't know if you knew this or not, but there are Alps in California.
[time=1705] Way up there, lots of snow, very cold, rock climbing, backpacking, and glacier climbing.
[time=1710] It was intense.
[time=1711] And I actually had a great time.
[time=1713] And then the last day of the 14 day deal, the leaders come and tell you they're taking you on your solo.
[time=1720] The solo, this was unannounced.
[time=1722] This was not something I had been anticipating.
[time=1724] The last 24 hours of the trip, they're going to take you up in the mountains by yourself.
[time=1729] Mark out an area that you cannot leave with your sleeping bag, your Bible, and a canteen.
[time=1735] I'm thinking you've got to be kidding me.
[time=1738] And they'll come back and get you in 24 hours.
[time=1740] I went absolutely ballistic.
[time=1742] Part of that time, had you ever spent 24 hours alone?
[time=1744] Never.
[time=1746] No.
[time=1747] Has anybody ever spent 24 hours alone?
[time=1748] Raise your hand.
[time=1749] I mean, come on.
[time=1750] I'll put him down.
[time=1751] [laughter] So I'm there.
[time=1754] Yeah, it's a long story.
[time=1756] But yeah, it just drove me nuts.
[time=1757] I didn't like the thought of being alone.
[time=1759] And part of it was nature and bears and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1762] But part of it was, and you know what I've realized over the years, I'll be honest with you here.
[time=1766] I realized over the years part of what I didn't like about being alone was sometimes what
[time=1772] I would tend to think about.
[time=1775] Sometimes when you're alone with God, he speaks.
[time=1781] Sometimes when you shut up long enough, he moves.
[time=1787] And sometimes I found that to be unsettling.
[time=1790] I think sometimes with my life and where I've been, even as an adult, sometimes being alone and quiet, it's been very difficult.
[time=1799] But I'm learning.
[time=1800] I got a friend.
[time=1801] Well, let me show you this verse.
[time=1803] Luke 6, 12.
[time=1804] Mitchell read it.
[time=1805] Let me just read it to you again.
[time=1806] I want you to see this in our Lord.
[time=1808] My friends, we see this in Jesus.
[time=1809] We see this in our Lord.
[time=1811] Time and time and time again.
[time=1814] Please read the Gospels.
[time=1815] As you go through the Gospels, you see this phrase.
[time=1818] You see this picture getting painted again and again and again.
[time=1822] It was at this time that he, Jesus, went off to the mountain.
[time=1826] I want you to stop there and underline the mountain.
[time=1829] Watch this, my friends.
[time=1830] He went somewhere.
[time=1832] He didn't stay where he was.
[time=1834] He didn't remain geographically or literally in the place of his life
[time=1840] where everything was going on and all the people were talking and all the responsibilities were there.
[time=1844] No, solitude.
[time=1845] We see here has a destination in a sense.
[time=1848] He actually separated himself from the routine, went to a place.
[time=1853] Where's your place?
[time=1859] Away from all the noise.
[time=1862] Away from all the distraction.
[time=1863] Away from all the interruptions.
[time=1866] I have a friend who actually goes into a closet.
[time=1871] Seriously.
[time=1872] It's got this little setup where it goes into a closet that's been prepared.
[time=1877] Even has, and I've learned about this as I've studied in the Jewish tradition, there was the prayer shawl and they would kneel to pray and actually cover themselves with the blanket, if you will, and under the quietness of that
[time=1891] blanket meet with and dialogue with and pray to and listen to God.
[time=1899] So where's your place?
[time=1901] Jesus, it says, went off to the mountain to pray.
[time=1903] Very intentional.
[time=1905] Didn't go off to hang out.
[time=1907] Didn't go off to just kind of do whatever.
[time=1909] No, he went off to communicate.
[time=1911] He went off to a place to listen to, to pray.
[time=1915] And he spent the, what's that saying?
[time=1918] Whole night.
[time=1920] Now, you know what, Mitchell and I are not here this morning to bring some new bar.
[time=1924] You know, we're not here to come and tell you that if you're going to really have solitude, you've got to find a closet, bury yourself in a blanket and stay in there all night.
[time=1932] That's not the point.
[time=1933] The point is, I bet you, I bet you could, I bet many of you could meet with him quietly for longer periods of time than you do.
[time=1947] For many of us, the quietness and the stillness and the being with him, you know, we just struggle to slow down and it may not be all night, but you know what, maybe it could be 20 minutes instead of five.
[time=1961] Maybe it could be 30, 35, 45, you know, with him instead of just 10.
[time=1967] Maybe it could be something beyond you just feeling convicted in the car and turning off the radio and grabbing five minutes on your way to the next appointment.
[time=1975] Nothing wrong with that.
[time=1977] But the solitude, this drawing near to him, it's so pertinent.
[time=1981] James 4-8, I want you to write this down.
[time=1983] Look what this says.
[time=1984] This is a great, here's our Kohan activity right here in James 4-8.
[time=1988] It says, "Draw near to God." Look at the statement.
[time=1990] Look what God says.
[time=1991] Look what is absolutely declaratively communicated right here, that if you draw near to God, he will what?
[time=1999] Say it.
[time=2000] "Draw near to you." He wants to come toward you.
[time=2003] He wants to fill you up.
[time=2005] He wants to bring to you the direction and the guidance and the encouragement that you and I desperately need personally and then so that we can pass it along to others, but we've got to draw near.
[time=2017] Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
[time=2020] Look at Psalm 42.
[time=2022] Would you go there real quick?
[time=2023] Go back in the Old Testament to Psalm 42 verses 1 and 2.
[time=2027] Now in Psalm 42, 1 and 2, it gives you, it paints this great picture of the deer.
[time=2033] Now I don't have any pet deers, but I got a couple of pet dogs.
[time=2037] And I know, as many of you know, what it looks like to see an animal who's really, really thirsty.
[time=2043] Go ahead, picture that.
[time=2044] Picture one of your little dogs, one of your big dogs.
[time=2046] One of your whatever is really, really thirsty.
[time=2051] I love how it says it here.
[time=2052] I love how the psalmist writes it as the deer pants for the water
[time=2058] brook.
[time=2059] So my soul pants for you.
[time=2062] Oh God.
[time=2063] It goes on in verse 2 to say, "My soul thirsts for God, for the live, my soul at the deepest part of me." He says, "His soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[time=2075] When shall I come and appear before God?" Now most of you in the room, I want you to think about this.
[time=2080] Most of you in the room have run a couple miles.
[time=2083] Most of you have played in some kind of competition.
[time=2086] Most of you have been out on a hot day.
[time=2088] Most of us in the room have experienced being thirsty.
[time=2091] There is a thirst that is described here, kind of triggered by that word panting that most of us don't understand.
[time=2099] My friends, this speaks to the deepest thirst we could ever experience.
[time=2103] This speaks to the dryness, the neediness of the soul, and at that point in your life where you need something, your inclination is to draw near to him and find that relief, to find that living water with him.
[time=2121] And I'll just be honest with you, and you'll probably want to just be honest with me.
[time=2125] Most of us don't do that.
[time=2129] Most of us today find ourselves going other places.
[time=2134] The prophet Jeremiah talked about it.
[time=2138] I believe in Jeremiah too.
[time=2140] He said, "My people have wandered away.
[time=2144] They've dug wells, dug cisterns, broken cisterns that can't hold water.
[time=2149] We go to water that doesn't quench." And he said, "Wait a minute, draw near to me, and I will draw near to you.
[time=2158] Come to me with all your thirst, and meet with me." As Mitchell and I talked about this, and as I said to you earlier, Jesus, again and again and again, models this for us, and not just every once in a while.
[time=2174] Mitchell, tell him what you found.
[time=2176] I think it was in Luke. Is that right?
[time=2178] It's in Luke 21, 37, and I think it's in all the gospels.
[time=2181] Luke 21, 37.
[time=2183] It says now, "During the day," in NIVS, it says every day, he was teaching in the temple.
[time=2189] But at evening, NIVS says every night, he would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet.
[time=2196] Jesus did this every day.
[time=2201] Jesus had solitude with the Father every day.
[time=2209] He prioritized it in his life.
[time=2212] If I were going to give you an analogy of what solitude is, it's really the definition of prayer.
[time=2219] Prayer prosuke in Greek is my heart connected with gods, and the illustration would be this.
[time=2224] It would be online with God.
[time=2227] Online with God.
[time=2230] My heart connected with his, and then the requests, the petitions, that's all a subset of first being online with God and having his heart shaped in mind as we're connected online 24/7.
[time=2244] I live out in the boondocks.
[time=2246] And so, all I've had is dial up for the internet connection.
[time=2250] And I...
[time=2252] [imitates boondocks] Yeah, I hate that.
[time=2255] So it's bad.
[time=2257] And girls are doing more and more stuff where they need higher speed.
[time=2260] And so, I looked at a couple options.
[time=2262] It's really got down to only one option in the boondocks.
[time=2264] And that was satellite.
[time=2266] Satellite internet connection.
[time=2269] Until Verizon brings...where is he?
[time=2271] Where's Elmer?
[time=2273] One's Verizon bringing fiber optic out to my place.
[time=2276] When will it come, Kelly?
[time=2277] I think Elmer said after it goes to Woodburn.
[time=2279] That's right.
[time=2280] That's where he lives.
[time=2281] Okay, so...
[time=2282] That's where Elmer lives.
[time=2283] So anyway, I'm not going to see that for a while, so I got satellite.
[time=2286] Well, the guy, when he got all done, I bet he says it to everybody.
[time=2290] When he got done installing the satellite internet, he looked at me and he said, "Now you're online, man 24/7." I said, "Thank you." And that's what you and I have the opportunity to do with God.
[time=2304] We have the opportunity in Christ to be online 24/7.
[time=2309] Jesus did it every day.
[time=2311] And this is designed to be a catalyst.
[time=2313] This quiet time is designed to be a catalyst for us to be online with God 24/7.
[time=2318] It's not about creating boundaries, and that's the only place that this happens.
[time=2322] No, the solitude, the times of practical applications we're going to talk about are catalysts to being online with God 24/7.
[time=2330] And I want to talk about two non-negotiables.
[time=2332] As we look at these practical applications for solitude, two non-negotiables.
[time=2336] And the first one is the Bible.
[time=2339] Now, I know for somewhere between 900 and 1,000 years, only the clergy had the Bible.
[time=2343] The people didn't, believers didn't, but you and I do.
[time=2346] And so we should bring the Word of God, bring the Bible into our solitude,
[time=2353] our time alone with God.
[time=2355] And then the second one, of course, would be prayer.
[time=2358] My heart connected with His.
[time=2360] And in that is this communication where He shapes His heart in mind.
[time=2365] He shapes my heart to be like His.
[time=2367] And the petitions and the requests all get fired up in that connection.
[time=2371] So two non-negotiables in solitude, the Bible in prayer, and Kelly's going to talk about some practical applications for your solitude.
[time=2379] Yeah, really, really practical.
[time=2381] That's the hope today.
[time=2382] This isn't going to be real deep.
[time=2383] This isn't going to be real complicated.
[time=2385] The hope today is that you would leave, either encouraged and reminded, because you're engaged in these kinds of very practical everyday activities with Him and in solitude.
[time=2394] Or hopefully, maybe you leave really challenged.
[time=2397] And with some questions as to how you can pursue it.
[time=2400] Because I want to just say this to you.
[time=2402] I want to just get every person in the room this morning to just answer the question, you know, quietly in your own heart.
[time=2407] What do you do when you get up?
[time=2410] It's the first thing, you know, first couple, two, three thing.
[time=2412] What do you do?
[time=2414] How, when do you get up?
[time=2416] If your day starts, if your day needs to, you know, if your work begins here, when are you getting up?
[time=2422] If school begins here, when are you getting up?
[time=2427] And I'm not trying to bank all this on when you get up.
[time=2430] Mitchell was just very clear.
[time=2431] This isn't just, this isn't only about when you get up.
[time=2434] But it's about when you get up and what flows out of what took place when you got up.
[time=2439] When do you get up?
[time=2442] And what are you giving yourself to in that first half hour, that first 45 minutes?
[time=2448] Some very practical things to consider.
[time=2450] Some may apply to you, some may not give us grace.
[time=2453] We're just trying to kind of go across the board.
[time=2455] One thing we wrote down, again, very practical may not sound very spiritual to you.
[time=2460] But we think it has great potential to be.
[time=2462] And that is to spend time alone with them while you physically exercise.
[time=2466] Just your own private, you know, worship, you know, workout.
[time=2470] However you want to say that, you know, I can go down to my basement.
[time=2474] You can go wherever you go.
[time=2475] We can be alone.
[time=2476] I learned from some younger friends, finally, it was embarrassed to say to them, I didn't know how to do this.
[time=2482] But I finally learned how to download messages from guys I really like listening to,
[time=2489] onto my, from iTunes, onto my iPod, and I can then put the, you know, the ear plugs in
[time=2498] and do what has been for most of my adult life, the bane of my existence.
[time=2503] I hate jogging.
[time=2506] Can I hear an amen?
[time=2508] I hate it.
[time=2509] But I realized I can do it.
[time=2511] I can do it.
[time=2512] And I can, I mean, I can really do it.
[time=2514] I mean, I'm thinking about marathon.
[time=2516] No, just kidding.
[time=2517] I can really do it when I got something in my ear that's feeding me and encouraging me
[time=2523] and getting me to ponder.
[time=2525] And inevitably I end up, I end up singing or I end up talking to him.
[time=2529] I end up, it is a great way for me while moving my heart physically to really engage my
[time=2535] heart spiritually.
[time=2536] It's just something that's been really, really encouraging.
[time=2539] I can put on the, on the tray there, I can print off, I can print off, you know, the scriptures or other messages and really big, you know, font because I can't read very well these days from a distance.
[time=2550] I can do that while I work out Mitchell.
[time=2552] What do you do on that front?
[time=2554] I either have a worship video or have the music like you do with the messages while I'm running
[time=2561] on the treadmill or if I do the elliptical machine, I can actually have the Bible in front of me and do my reading through the Bible at that time.
[time=2569] Sometimes I go deeper into a message or something at that time.
[time=2572] So what's nice is I can again, just to get back to our original point, I can, having done that, I can sit there on the stool still pretty early in the morning and be quiet.
[time=2582] Having taken all that in, I can then, before I get upstairs and do whatever I got to do, I can be quiet.
[time=2589] I can write some things down, I can pray some even more intentional prayers.
[time=2594] It's a really good thing.
[time=2596] There's also just the kind of the traditional, you've heard about it maybe for years, the quiet time.
[time=2600] But others of you in the room haven't heard about the traditional quiet time.
[time=2604] What are some things you could do in the morning, noon or night?
[time=2608] We just wrote down a few for you.
[time=2610] Write this down, three P's, not complicated, Psalms.
[time=2614] You get up in time, you get up with plenty of time to read a Psalm, a proverb as you read through that Psalm and that proverb.
[time=2621] You have a little notebook next to you there and you write a few things down that come to mind.
[time=2624] You write a few prayer requests.
[time=2626] You write some things you feel convicted about.
[time=2628] Write down some questions that you might have.
[time=2630] A Psalm, a proverb and a time of prayer.
[time=2633] Not real complicated, but I'll tell you what, really, really encouraging.
[time=2637] You need something like this.
[time=2639] A book study with a commentary.
[time=2641] We've been working on this at our home with some of our kids.
[time=2644] There's some commentaries.
[time=2646] As you get a little bit older, you realize that there are those who have written some really, really trusted voices
[time=2652] and those who have written about what the Bible says.
[time=2655] Commentaries, you can read through a book of the Bible.
[time=2658] Take a few verses.
[time=2659] Take a chapter and then read along with that the things that have been written by trusted commentators
[time=2665] over the years.
[time=2666] We could help you find some commentaries.
[time=2668] You could go to anchor room and get a commentary and read along with your Bible reading some things that would really bring to light the great truth, the life-changing truth of the Scripture.
[time=2678] Bible study with a workbook.
[time=2679] Some folks like this, some folks don't.
[time=2681] There are some people who really enjoy having a supplemental workbook connected to this passage
[time=2689] or this book that you're studying and the chance to just actually kind of interact cognitively, write some answers down to some questions that are being asked based upon what you're reading.
[time=2699] You can do that again in the early morning hours at lunch.
[time=2702] You can do it at night, a chance for you to connect and be quiet and be with and learn from
[time=2708] and be encouraged by the Scriptures.
[time=2710] A few other ideas.
[time=2711] Well, if the Bible is intimidating to you, you could probably go out here right now in the foyer in either order or actually get a life application Bible.
[time=2720] I think it's one of the best published practical Bibles ever put together.
[time=2726] The questions that you have when you read it typically has those and it's footnotes and commentary at the bottom.
[time=2732] It has studies on biblical characters and I've purchased one for many people who for the
[time=2739] first time are going on their journey to read the Bible and the feedback is 100% so I'd
[time=2746] really encourage that the life application Bible.
[time=2748] One of the things you can do to make it really practical is you can read the Bible in that solitude time and then you can get a journal out and write down your, write out your prayers to God.
[time=2760] A name that most of you would know said one time that there's something convicting about ink on paper confessing my sins to God saying seeing it I did this I said that I went there.
[time=2777] And so I'd encourage you to maybe consider that if that's for you it's one practical way.
[time=2782] And another thing when you're reading the Bible it's probably good just to have a notebook of some kind there so when an aha moment occurs and you want to remember the reference, the
[time=2792] chapter and verse reference you can write it down.
[time=2794] Because I think I'll think oh yeah I'll remember that and two, three days later I got another thought going on my mind I think where was that?
[time=2800] Where did I do that?
[time=2801] It's so much easier if you just have it down on a daily basis kind of write down the thoughts that come to you as you're reading the Bible.
[time=2808] Kind of the aha maybe things that you want to go deeper.
[time=2811] Another one is to read through the Bible in a year.
[time=2814] You know I'm a big proponent of this because for almost 20 years now I've done this and this has changed my life probably more than any single other godly pursuit, divine pursuit
[time=2826] or discipline.
[time=2829] I talked about this on December 31st here's just four ways that maybe you could do that and it's 101201301401.
[time=2837] 101 was read a chapter of Dan Proverbs corresponding with the date of the month.
[time=2842] That is the ultimate book to apply to make sticky my relationship with God to my circumstances.
[time=2849] I've done it again and again for years and it's new every day.
[time=2852] Because my circumstances are new every day.
[time=2855] 201 is to read a chapter of Dan Proverbs corresponding with the date of the month or 31 chapters in Proverbs and a chapter of day in the New Testament that gets you through the New Testament in a year.
[time=2866] And that is powerful because you get to see the wisdom lived out in the life of Christ and then the people who were discipled by Him and how it got paid forward.
[time=2875] And there's even room in there for you for you to miss some days.
[time=2878] So I just if you're here today and you're not doing 101 or 201 man I would just say
[time=2884] please leave here today if that's the only thing you do and do one of those.
[time=2889] Just to one of those in your solitude time.
[time=2892] 301 is 201 plus read three chapters a day in the Old Testament which will get you through
[time=2898] the whole Bible in a year and it even leaves a little bit of for missing some days.
[time=2903] But that's powerful it puts the New Testament in context.
[time=2906] It's really really powerful.
[time=2908] And then 401 can happen almost by osmosis if you do 301.
[time=2913] 401 would be 301 reading a chapter day in Proverbs a chapter day in the New Testament three chapters a day in the Old and just take a verse a week or maybe even a month and memorize it.
[time=2925] Hide it in your heart so you can recall it and bring wisdom to the trials that come your way.
[time=2931] You know this can happen in the morning.
[time=2934] This can happen at a lunch break.
[time=2936] This can happen at night before you go to bed.
[time=2939] I like book ending my day if I'm not going to study all day if it's not a day like that for me.
[time=2944] I like book ending my days with the Bible.
[time=2948] A Jewish person would pray five times a day.
[time=2952] So they would recite the Shama Deuteronomy 6, 4 through 9.
[time=2957] They'd do that all those times.
[time=2960] And so what we're saying here is kind of what God intended for your life.
[time=2965] And all of these tools are just a catalyst for you to be online with God.
[time=2969] For me to be online with God 24/7.
[time=2972] And I'll just say this.
[time=2973] To be online.
[time=2974] Watch this.
[time=2975] To be online with God.
[time=2976] To be able to receive.
[time=2977] To be able to end that connection here from him.
[time=2980] Here the message that he has for you in that moment.
[time=2984] The truth that he wants to remind you of.
[time=2986] Okay.
[time=2987] Here's the deal.
[time=2988] In the everyday of your life in mind my friends we are absolutely bombarded by messages.
[time=2996] They are coming at you left and right.
[time=2999] They never end.
[time=3000] It is never ceasing.
[time=3001] The enemy is always through the media and through the radio and through the computer and through
[time=3007] people and through circumstances.
[time=3009] Every chance he gets they come at you a thousand miles an hour.
[time=3012] So I would Mitchell would propose to you that while we've been talking about morning, noon or night.
[time=3019] I don't think there's anything wrong with you and I spending time with him morning, noon and night.
[time=3028] Three times in the midst of all that you and I face.
[time=3034] What a great opportunity for you and I to be strengthened and built up and encouraged and reminded.
[time=3040] Tell them what Deborah said.
[time=3042] Oh yes, after first hour we were just talking.
[time=3045] I was talking to my wife and she talked about how solitude often times.
[time=3050] While I can have my solitude often times interrupted by people or opportunities to be with people.
[time=3057] We were talking about how sometimes with other folks solitude can get interrupted by tasks.
[time=3063] Some of you are pretty driven on the task front.
[time=3068] Relax and spend the time and listen and I would guess the tasks would go a whole lot better
[time=3077] with that kind of connection with that kind of online experience with him.
[time=3081] Keep going.
[time=3082] Well we had a bent a day towards solitude but the second thing that we saw modeled in Jesus's life is a second prerequisite to ministry to priestly living his community.
[time=3089] Jesus took, he had a lot of disciples and he chose 12 to go deeper with, to have community
[time=3095] with.
[time=3096] And I think there are three non-negotiables that have to take place in community and being together in unity in Christ.
[time=3104] And the first one I would say is love.
[time=3106] You need to be serving each other.
[time=3108] These are good.
[time=3109] Make sure you get these down.
[time=3110] Three words that all begin with the letter L. I'll be easy for you to remember.
[time=3113] So love, John 1334, a new commandment I give you Jesus said that you love one another.
[time=3118] That's not new.
[time=3119] That was an Old Testament command.
[time=3121] Here's what's new.
[time=3122] As I have loved you that you also love one another.
[time=3126] Jesus gave in the ultimate clarity how we're to love one another.
[time=3129] And we need to do that.
[time=3131] We need to bring community to our relationships.
[time=3133] Love in Christ serving.
[time=3135] Jesus served the disciples.
[time=3138] Second one is to lean.
[time=3140] To lean.
[time=3141] I lean on Kelly when he needs a little prompting.
[time=3145] And I lean on Kelly when I need some help.
[time=3149] So leaning is kind of a two way street.
[time=3152] And Doug Crane taught us this.
[time=3154] He got us together all the pastors.
[time=3156] Doug volunteers is the executive pastor.
[time=3158] Got us together.
[time=3159] Did a devotional.
[time=3160] Gave us these ropes.
[time=3162] Those string rope things.
[time=3164] I think his daughters did enforce.
[time=3166] Wove them together.
[time=3167] We all put them in our Bibles.
[time=3168] And this is a verse he taught on.
[time=3170] I said if anyone can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him.
[time=3174] A chord of three strands is not quickly torn apart.
[time=3177] When we lean in community on one another, we gain strength.
[time=3182] My grandfather says it this way.
[time=3185] Two of us can beat anyone man.
[time=3189] It's just between us.
[time=3191] He just likes imitating his grandfather.
[time=3193] But watch this.
[time=3194] I don't want you to miss this.
[time=3195] This is very important because I know many of you in the room have experienced this.
[time=3198] It is so vital that we would in our priestly living, in our lives, in our attempt to follow
[time=3205] Christ.
[time=3206] It's so important that we would do what he just said.
[time=3208] That in our community, in our relationships with each other, that we've got to not only love and serve but lean.
[time=3215] And my mind goes to the exercise that we used to do as kids.
[time=3219] And I've done it as an adult in different settings, but you know you'll be in a group of folks.
[time=3224] And somebody will say, okay, somebody stand and face this way.
[time=3227] And somebody stands and faces that way.
[time=3229] And then they get some people behind the guy or the gal.
[time=3231] And they tell the guy or the gal to what?
[time=3233] To fall backwards.
[time=3235] And everybody's going to what?
[time=3237] Everybody's going to catch him.
[time=3239] Well, the truth of the matter is that there's a lot of folks in this room, myself included, who have leaned and not been caught.
[time=3248] We've been dropped.
[time=3251] And then what happens is you start thinking, well, you know what?
[time=3254] I thought the whole leaning on each other was a good thing.
[time=3258] But I don't think it's such a good thing anymore.
[time=3260] And then we stop leaning.
[time=3262] And that's death.
[time=3264] And I know that experiences have been painful.
[time=3266] And I know there are times when you've been deeply wounded.
[time=3269] But the fact of the matter is you cannot stand alone.
[time=3274] He will.
[time=3275] The enemy will eat your lunch.
[time=3277] And we've got to be people who continue in community to lean.
[time=3282] And if it doesn't go well, we've got to make it right.
[time=3285] But we've got to keep leaning.
[time=3287] Learning is the third.
[time=3289] Yes.
[time=3290] Love, lean, and learn.
[time=3291] Proverbs 27, 17.
[time=3293] Iron sharpens iron.
[time=3294] So one man sharpens another.
[time=3296] There's something about community that we can learn from each other on how we have uniquely applied our relationship with God to our circumstances.
[time=3304] How God has uniquely fashioned us as priests.
[time=3307] And all of these, both the Bible and prayer and solitude and both love, learn, lean and learn, imply listening.
[time=3315] Listening.
[time=3316] But this one especially, we've got to listen to each other in order to learn.
[time=3320] It's a prerequisite to learning.
[time=3323] We just want to give you quickly practical everyday examples of how to do community.
[time=3327] So you already have relationships.
[time=3329] We're talking about bringing community, bring together in unity in Christ to those relationships.
[time=3334] Let solitude intersect with community.
[time=3336] And there are three simple ways, the board room, the living room, the rec room.
[time=3339] If you want to write it down, the board room, the living room, the rec room.
[time=3344] The board room is at work.
[time=3346] Why not bring community into your career?
[time=3350] Why not bring that kind of level of relationship to the people you work with?
[time=3358] Last night at dinner, the waitress told us a little story about how she had switched restaurants and she loved where she was working.
[time=3365] One of the reasons she loved it is that she lost her car and she was going to lose her job because she didn't have transportation to get there.
[time=3372] And she said, "You know what?
[time=3374] All these people whom I love, they made sure I had transportation to work every day so I didn't lose my job."
[time=3383] I opened the door for us to talk about a God thing and I said, "You have any church background?" She said, "Yeah, but I don't go right now." And I said, "Well, they were your church for you, weren't they?
[time=3392] They were your community." She said, "Yeah, they were." And the joy that was inside her, she was contagious about it.
[time=3397] Second one would be the living room.
[time=3398] That could be where you get connected to a small group and you can do that here.
[time=3401] You can get connected with other couples, other people walking through life, other families walking through life in solitude and in community.
[time=3409] And you can connect and you can love, lean and learn there in the living rooms.
[time=3415] And if you want to do that, they can get ahold of Josh.
[time=3418] You can talk to you, me, Josh.
[time=3420] They can talk to anybody that they know that's part of the team here.
[time=3423] We would love to help you get connected in that kind of a setting.
[time=3427] And then the boardroom, the living room, the rec room, the recreation room, wherever we do our hobbies and our fun, you know, they're called affinity groups.
[time=3436] If you love airplanes, if you love cars, if you love sports, if you're coaching, go do that and bring community there.
[time=3444] Bring community there to those relationships.
[time=3448] And then you will experience ministry.
[time=3452] I want to highlight that last verse.
[time=3456] Luke 6, Luke 6, 19, "For power was coming from Him and healing them all.
[time=3465] The power of the Spirit of Christ can come from you and heal the souls and the hearts around you so that they can be shaped like Christ.
[time=3477] And in doing so, something happens to your heart and the mind where solitude intersects with community.
[time=3484] Ministry flows out and it's a byproduct and it's not me and it's not you, it's Christ in us."
[time=3491] Tell them what you said this week when we were talking about this, how often times we get it backwards.
[time=3496] So many of us will say, "I think God's prompted me to do that.
[time=3499] I'm not sure, you know, I'm going to go start this ministry." Some people say, "I'm going to go start this church. I'm going to go start this ministry." And then when it fails, what's the first thing they do?
[time=3511] Start, "Oh God, could you please help me? What did I do?" And Jesus did it the other way around.
[time=3518] You pray first. You have solitude first.
[time=3522] You have community and intersect those two and out of that, naturally, by the power of the Spirit of Christ will flow ministry to literally serve others.
