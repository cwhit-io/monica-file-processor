[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=44] end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=58] I dream of a city called glory.
[time=86] So bright and so fair, When I enter the gates, I cry, "Holy, the angels, oh, bet we there."
[time=116] They carried me from mention to mention and all the sites I saw.
[time=138] When I said, "I want to see Jesus, the one who died for all."
[time=155] When I bowed on my knees and cried, "Holy, the cry, holy, holy, I clap my hands and
[time=184] my hand, glory to the sun, oh, glory to the sun, oh, God, as I enter."
[time=209] The gates of that city, my loved ones all knew we would love.
[time=227] They took me down the streets of heaven, for the seas to many to tell, I saw Abraham,
[time=252] Jacob, and I said, talked with Mark, and Timothy, oh, when I said, "Timothy, I want to see
[time=279] Jesus, 'cause he's the one who died for me, and I bow on my knees and cried, "Holy, the
[time=305] Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the
[time=399] the knees of our hearts, and seeing glory, I pray, Lord, that you would empower us by
[time=411] your spirit to worship you appropriately.
[time=416] We don't want to mishandle the opportunity to do that.
[time=422] I thank you for those words that remind us that we'll be with you one day, and Lord, we
[time=428] are really looking forward to that because you deserve our full attention, and I thank
[time=437] you.
[time=439] Thank you for redeeming us.
[time=442] Thank you for the hope that the resurrection brings that we will be there with you, and
[time=450] please, Lord, let us learn this morning what you want us to learn together, in Christ's
[time=456] name I pray, amen.
[time=459] I used to sing that high, not anymore, that was about age nine.
[time=476] Well Kelly suggested that I preach today and that I would share what I've been learning
[time=485] about church lately, and I said, man, that is dangerous.
[time=491] And he said, yeah, he knew that, but it was okay, he was going to take a risk.
[time=496] I've been learning a lot about the body of Christ lately, and I'm really, really thankful
[time=503] that I get a chance to think about it and put it together in some thoughts and then come here with you and together wrestle with what these things, what might be wrong with some
[time=513] of my thinking.
[time=514] I'm wide open to that.
[time=515] They interrupt me during the service though.
[time=517] I'd rather wait till afterward on that, except for Dave and Eve.
[time=520] You guys have earned the right, you can just, I am the holy one, has redeemed me.
[time=535] He created me, and then he redeemed me.
[time=540] And because he's redeemed to me, and he's called me by name, it says in Isaiah 43, says
[time=546] I'm his.
[time=548] He bought me with a price.
[time=552] Because that's true, my response to that is, then who am I, and what do you want me
[time=558] to do?
[time=559] If you're I am, and you're the holy one, and you created me, and you bought me with a
[time=565] price, you redeemed me and called me by name, I get to be, who am I, and what do you want me to do?
[time=570] And what do you want us to do as the church, the body of Christ?
[time=575] And he gave us a lot of answers, and we get to do it together.
[time=586] He wants us individually and collectively to be holy.
[time=594] How's that sound?
[time=597] He wants us to be holy as he is holy.
[time=601] He wants us, other words, like complete, mature, perfect the King James says.
[time=610] Perfect as he's perfect.
[time=612] He calls us to that, and so I hear that when I believe that I think, oh my goodness, how
[time=618] in the world can I ever do that?
[time=621] I can't.
[time=623] But he can't end me.
[time=625] It's Christ in us that makes it possible for us to respond to the call of God to be holy
[time=632] as he's holy.
[time=634] And together we get to participate in that, sharpening each other when we need to, lifting
[time=641] each other up when we need to, comforting each other when we need to.
[time=651] I've learned that the big sea church, I've traveled more lately the last few years, I've
[time=659] learned that the big sea church has mighty men and women of God everywhere.
[time=667] And I bump into these people and they're in remote parts of the world and I go, oh my goodness, why haven't you been on the radio?
[time=675] Why haven't you been the one on television?
[time=678] But I glean from those people that have been laboring for Christ in unusual places.
[time=685] I marvel at them as they've grown in Christ and how much they know his word.
[time=690] They've meditated on it day and night the way he tells us to.
[time=697] They are everywhere.
[time=698] And one of the things that I realize is everywhere you go you find out the form is different.
[time=705] The function's not different, but the form is really different all over the world.
[time=712] And I've had questions about that for years.
[time=715] I've wondered why the form here as it changed, which it does, we always say we've always had
[time=723] change, always there always will be change and then when changes happen we say we're gone, we're done, we don't want it.
[time=731] This change has brought a different form to the way church looks and sounds and tastes
[time=738] and smells.
[time=739] When our senses don't get the kind of sensory reaction that we want them to have, sometimes
[time=747] we don't react the best ways.
[time=748] I've been observing that.
[time=751] It's been interesting for me, I was with a guy that grew up in the States and he had a really good Baptist heritage and he knew he wouldn't do this, this, this and this until he got the Ecuador and then he found out you did this, this and this, now not this.
[time=766] But you did these three there because that's how you reach people for Christ there and that's how you grow in Christ and they weren't wrong, never ever waver on the absolute principles
[time=777] that are clearly spelled out in the Word of God.
[time=780] But the form for the way we do it isn't spelled out here so much.
[time=786] The function is.
[time=788] I've been learning a lot about that.
[time=790] I've been learning that God wants me in a tension filled relationship with him rather
[time=796] than practicing a religion.
[time=798] Now I've always known that but I've been learning what that really is like lately.
[time=805] He wants me, you know when he wanted the Old Testament Israelites to know how he wanted
[time=814] to do things and what it needed to look like and when they needed to do it, it wasn't
[time=820] vague.
[time=821] Try Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteront, look through the books, read through, see if there's any, put the blood on the right big toe.
[time=829] He gets sprinkled on the right ear lobe of the priest.
[time=834] He gets real specific and I wonder sometimes why isn't the New Testament church spelled
[time=840] out that way because he doesn't want it to be, he wants the form to be able to change
[time=848] with the times but the function.
[time=852] Loving God, loving people, that's not changing.
[time=861] He says there are elders, leaders, deacons, there are leaders in the church that are in
[time=867] authority over the local church, the small sea church and he wants for them to be on their
[time=873] knees as overseers and shepherds of men's souls realizing that they have an overseer.
[time=883] He says that to elders.
[time=885] There's a list of character qualities that he wants elders to live up by, live up to and he wants others to aspire to that and he says you can recognize who they are by seeing
[time=896] what these character qualities are and you spot those people, they're the elders, they're the deacons.
[time=903] What's common in both is a very humble heart.
[time=908] A person who doesn't want to lead, doesn't need to lead but is willing to lead and he
[time=916] says to the young men, he says wait your turn, be submissive.
[time=924] First Peter chapter 5, he tells the elders that they're overseers and they're shepherds and they need to do these things and it says to the young men, humble yourselves therefore in the mighty hand of God, preceding that verse it says submit yourselves to the elders
[time=939] and be humble one toward another and then humble yourself in the mighty hand of God and
[time=946] he will lift you up in due time.
[time=948] There comes a time when you'll get to change the form.
[time=954] You'll get to be the person, one of the people who gets to decide what the form is like at that time that'll be healthiest for the body of Christ.
[time=963] You know what the next verse says after he says humble yourselves into the mighty hand of God and he will lift you up in due time, we take this one out of context a lot but the next verse says cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you because it'll create great anxiety.
[time=977] One of the things I think we've failed at, as a teacher I think I've failed here.
[time=983] I don't think in the last fifty hundred years, I don't know how long in the U.S.
[time=988] We haven't prepared the people that were getting older to embrace the changes that the people
[time=997] that were younger were going to bring when they bring different form.
[time=1002] It's our fault, we haven't prepared for that.
[time=1005] Our natural tendency is to stiff arm those changes, that's what we want, we like things that are the same, most of us and even if you say you aren't a person who likes the same,
[time=1016] you want it a little bit different.
[time=1019] Not that much different.
[time=1022] And I think God wants me in a relationship with him that causes me to be willing to embrace
[time=1028] the changes that the next generation of leaders is bringing while I'm still here and I don't
[time=1035] think we've done real well at that.
[time=1038] He wants us to gather together and that's what I've been learning about church lately.
[time=1042] I've been learning, Kelly gave me the three G's, he knew I wouldn't have a good outline so he just gave me three G's and go with that.
[time=1049] Gathering groups and going, so that's what we're going to talk about this morning.
[time=1054] We won't spend a lot of time on each but we're going to talk a little bit about each.
[time=1061] He wants us to gather and I'll close this segment of the service with Hebrews chapter
[time=1067] ten.
[time=1072] Therefore brothers, since we have confidence to enter the most holy place, chapter ten
[time=1082] verse nineteen, by the blood of Jesus we're able to enter the most holy place.
[time=1092] By a new and living way opened for us through the curtain that is his body.
[time=1103] The curtain in the holy of holies was ripped from top to bottom because we have a new curtain.
[time=1114] And since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God.
[time=1121] That's why we gather.
[time=1124] With a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us
[time=1130] from a guilty conscience, we don't need the priest up here sprinkled on his big toe.
[time=1136] Our hearts are sprinkled with the blood of Christ.
[time=1139] We need to realize it when we gather together.
[time=1146] Let's sprinkle to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
[time=1153] Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess.
[time=1158] That's good.
[time=1161] For he who promised is faithful, he's the faithful one.
[time=1168] And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.
[time=1174] Let us not give up meeting together a summer in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another and all the more as the day is approaching.
[time=1186] Our five Es happen in the gathering, all of them, and they should be happening here.
[time=1198] I love that form and function thing, the church needs to be about the function and then adapt
[time=1205] our forms to meet the culture where they're at.
[time=1210] We live in a particular culture here in this part of our nation that's different than other parts of the city, other parts of the nation, other parts of the world.
[time=1219] One of the functions we've adopted that I think all churches should adopt and most of them do is to make Christ central when we gather, to worship him, because he's the reason we
[time=1230] come together and we try to do that every week, and we worship Christ in different ways.
[time=1237] Even the form varies from week to week here.
[time=1241] One of the forms is worshiping through song, a form is worshiping through prayer, worshiping
[time=1247] through the giving of ties and offerings which we do every week, worshiping through opening the word and teaching that we hear from Kelly and Mitch and Steve and Josh and others.
[time=1260] We want to practice that function today of worshiping Christ, the one who unites us and
[time=1266] makes us one and the one who is the reason that we gather.
[time=1272] Let's stand together and we're going to sing some songs that just worship and adore him and make him central among us today.
[time=1307] I will bless the Lord forever and I will trust him at all times.
[time=1333] He has delivered me from all fear, and he has set my feet upon the rock.
[time=1359] I will not be moved; I'll say of the Lord, you hold my shield, my strength, my motion,
[time=1381] deliver my shield, strong time, my very best and I am inside of me.
[time=1411] You have made me glad, you have made me glad.
[time=1439] I'll say of the Lord, you hold my shield, my strength, my motion, deliver my shield,
[time=1465] my power, my living hands and I, you hold my shield, my strength, my motion, deliver my
[time=1488] shield, strong time, my very best and I am inside of me.
[time=1518] You hold my shield, my strength, my strength, my strength, my power, my life, my life, my
[time=1538] life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my learning
[time=1580] you're my saving grace, you will reign forever, our ancient undead, you are the only God we can again,
[time=1597] you'll save your Messiah, be a demon and man, you're my precious the beast and I will live
[time=1608] my life for you, oh, the voice of Jesus, you are the Lord of hearts, you are King of peace,
[time=1622] you are the King of God, God of everything, know Him and you are, you're the King I am,
[time=1634] you're the Prince of peace, you will live my life, you're my saving grace, you will reign forever,
[time=1650] you are ancient and take, you are out of name, I'm the end, you're my saving grace, I'm the
[time=1663] only God I am, you're my precious the beast and I will live my life for you, you're my
[time=1679] prince of peace and I will live my life for you.
[time=1697] The gathering is one part of church and God expects us to participate together.
[time=1705] Groups are another part.
[time=1710] By groups, I don't mean you necessarily have to be plugged into the one way that somebody's doing it, I'm talking about being intimate with enough people, being in an intimate relationship
[time=1721] with them that you know them and they know you, that you are comfortable confessing your sin to them and they're comfortable confronting you about sin and then building each other
[time=1733] up in that.
[time=1736] I've been learning about groups.
[time=1740] One of my favorite groups these days is at work, the guys I work with, it's incredible
[time=1747] what's going on at AFE where I work, we're building one another up and we really care
[time=1753] about building the kingdom there and so we're willing to confront each other.
[time=1760] We've been learning about the kind of character that I was talking about that elders have.
[time=1763] You know in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus chapter 1, we developed this pyramid to help us define
[time=1769] what really healthy relationships are like, a really healthy relationship with God and a really healthy relationship with others and when you back off from that discovering how you can have really healthy relationships, I'll just kind of run you through it quickly, it's that you have mutually beneficial agreements, I mean I'm going to love you enough to confront you, beneficially.
[time=1789] We're going to mutually beneficial agreements.
[time=1791] I'm going to love you enough to comfort you beneficially.
[time=1794] We're going to agree with each other on that.
[time=1796] You can do that when you trust each other.
[time=1799] Trust in each other comes with observing character in people and character is observed when your
[time=1806] conduct is in alignment with what you say you believe and value.
[time=1816] When the convictions toward your conduct come out of what you really believe in value, then
[time=1822] your conduct will align with your convictions, your values, your beliefs, your faith, the
[time=1828] ultimate assumption you have that there is a God.
[time=1831] When that alignment takes place, people say oh, that's a person of character.
[time=1834] Now character is good or bad, but it's still character if your actions align with what you
[time=1842] say you believe, hypocrites are people who say they believe one thing and their conduct
[time=1851] reveals that they really value something else.
[time=1854] So we've been dealing with each other on that.
[time=1858] And we were working through this process and we said okay here's a good way, we're going to have the 30 top leaders in the organization come to a retreat, let's have them bring their checkbooks and their calendars to the retreat and we'll sit in a room together and they can evaluate their conduct and see if it aligns with what they say they believe.
[time=1876] And so we emailed everybody, bring your checkbook to the retreat.
[time=1881] Some people did not like that because you know what, in America we say that's private.
[time=1889] We say that's private.
[time=1890] You don't mess with my financial.
[time=1892] That's private.
[time=1893] As a matter of fact, we tell people all the time don't get in discussions in America about politics and religion.
[time=1901] That's private.
[time=1904] Those two things are, they're so public, they should be so public, you should be compelled
[time=1911] to embrace the reality that those should be public.
[time=1914] So we're at a meeting and we're talking it over about how to do it and one guy, one of the leaders, there are six of us there and he says to Darryl Doden, our leader.
[time=1921] He says that's private and a lot of people are concerned about bringing their checkbooks and our leader said back to him, you know, he said Christianity is very personal but
[time=1937] it's really seldom private and we need to learn that.
[time=1942] He said Christianity is very, very personal but it's really, as a matter of fact, it's
[time=1949] only private.
[time=1951] We've been developing this together lately and Darryl said to me the other day, you know, it's only private when you're protecting the other person in a God-honoring way or protecting
[time=1964] yourself in a God-honoring way.
[time=1966] There are times to protect privacy but it needs to align with what God would value in
[time=1974] that.
[time=1975] The Bible tells us to confess our sins one to another.
[time=1979] God wants us to be public with that with some people, not everybody, but you really need
[time=1986] to be in relationship with people at a level that allows you to tell them what you'd like
[time=1995] to keep private and have them tell you what they'd like to keep private.
[time=2003] God wants us to confess our sins one to another, James 5, several places in the Bible.
[time=2016] I want to look if you would just turn to 1 Corinthians 12 with me for just a minute.
[time=2021] 1 Corinthians 13 tells us how to love each other.
[time=2024] It's an incredible chapter.
[time=2025] We call it the love chapter, 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=2028] I love the half of a verse that precedes 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=2034] I just love this verse.
[time=2035] It's 1 Corinthians 12b, it's a second part, it's a sentence that leads into the love chapter.
[time=2042] It says, "And now I will show you the most excellent way." God, by His grace, for His glory, He has revealed to us the way to love Him and to love
[time=2056] each other, and it's all through the New Testament.
[time=2059] This just happens to be one of the places.
[time=2060] I've experienced such a love.
[time=2066] It'll be 11 years ago this week that Renee died, my first wife, and when she was ill
[time=2075] and then died, and I was single parenting for a couple of years, I experienced a small
[time=2081] group in my life that had been there since 1992, this was 1996, 1992, and they absolutely
[time=2089] loved me and my kids.
[time=2092] They loved me in lots of different ways.
[time=2099] And then I met Nancy a couple of years later, married her, and they loved me that way.
[time=2106] They embraced her and brought her into our intimate small group and made her feel really
[time=2112] welcome.
[time=2114] I've been really loved by these people.
[time=2115] They brought me stuff when I needed it.
[time=2118] Many of you did, but these guys especially, and the two in that group that were probably the most significant in working in that way, although they all did it in incredible ways.
[time=2128] But Jim and Kathy McCrady, we've been in a small group together since '92, and they just naturally, supernaturally.
[time=2134] They naturally, supernaturally, loved us.
[time=2138] And so they really met some of my needs.
[time=2143] You know what?
[time=2144] We're still in a small group together, and in January, Jim went to be with the Lord.
[time=2150] And so Kathy, for the last few years, has been experiencing in our small group what I got from her, and I've asked her to come this morning, and she's going to share with you some thoughts on small groups and intimacy in smaller groups.
[time=2165] I love you.
[time=2166] Let me get your microphone.
[time=2172] You're good.
[time=2176] Well, it's really a privilege to be here and give testimony to God's grace and faithfulness
[time=2185] in my life, and to share a few words in how He has done that through the church.
[time=2193] Friday night, I was at Stephen Ansey's for dinner, and Steve was pondering this message
[time=2200] that he was going to give today, and he asked us at the table, "What have you learned about
[time=2206] God and His church, and how has that impacted you?
[time=2209] What's been most significant recently?" And when it came my turn, I said, "You know, I really think small groups has been that
[time=2219] thing, and He asked me if I would share a few words why I thought that, and why I believe
[time=2226] that small groups in the body of Christ is so important as we share life together.
[time=2235] I want to define my idea of small group will help you frame my thinking about this.
[time=2241] I really believe it needs to be a small group of believers, and I say small because I think
[time=2248] it can get to a size at which it's not intimate any longer, and it's harder to care for one another, and it needs to be believers, people who have put their faith in Jesus Christ and
[time=2259] the work that He did for us in the cross and saving us, which allows us then to be indwelt by His Holy Spirit, and we need the Spirit of God to do the things that God has called us to do in small groups.
[time=2272] It's those who meet together regularly, it does not specify exactly what that needs to
[time=2278] look like, but we need to have regular contact with each other in order to know what's going on in our lives.
[time=2285] We need to be committed to relationship at a level, a deep level of caring and sharing
[time=2291] and loving, and lastly, I think we come together and live life together with the purpose of
[time=2298] first knowing God better, trusting Him more, following Him more closely, and also to experience
[time=2306] what Kelly and Mitch taught about last week, the love and lean and learn stuff, loving
[time=2314] God and others, each other, leaning on God first and then learning how to lean on each
[time=2322] other in this world, and then learning from God through learning from each other.
[time=2328] In fact, it reminded me of the Acts 242 church that you might remember, which says they devoted
[time=2336] themselves.
[time=2337] There's that commitment.
[time=2338] They devoted themselves to teaching and to fellowship and to the breaking of bread, to
[time=2345] prayer and praising God together.
[time=2349] Like Steve said, Jim and I have been involved in small groups for probably close to 15 years,
[time=2356] and in that, we really, we gained so much from others.
[time=2363] We learned practical wisdom on how to raise our children.
[time=2368] We learned how to have a good marriage by watching others model that in their lives and
[time=2374] watching them screw up and learning from their mistakes.
[time=2378] We learned how to manage our finances.
[time=2382] We did the Crown Ministry study in our group.
[time=2386] We learned about our spiritual gifts by doing a study on that.
[time=2390] We had accountability with each other, as Steve spoke of, and we learned to confess our
[time=2396] sins.
[time=2397] In fact, I have many small groups like the one that I'm in with Steve and Nancy, and one
[time=2405] of those groups, even yesterday, when I told them what they pray for me so that God would
[time=2412] use me today, they first asked me if there was any sin in my life, I needed to confess
[time=2418] so that I would be a clean vessel, and then we confessed together so that there wouldn't
[time=2424] be anything hindering what God might want to do in this gathering today.
[time=2429] And then most recently, like Steve said, I learned through this small group how to be loved and served sacrificially as Jim and I experienced the three years of his battle
[time=2442] with cancer and then his ultimate going home to be with the Lord in January.
[time=2449] And I'll never forget the day that Jim was diagnosed.
[time=2453] It's a surreal kind of day when you find that out in your life.
[time=2456] For those of you who maybe have experienced something like that.
[time=2460] And immediately, Kelly and Steve came over to our home to be with us, to support us, to pray with us, and I remember Steve saying, "I want to take some of your burden."
[time=2472] And it reminded me of Galatians 6-2, which says, "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the love of Christ." And he was being that for us that day.
[time=2483] I remember Jim sharing his fears with the two of them saying that he wasn't so much afraid of the cancer and afraid of dying himself.
[time=2492] But he didn't want to leave me and our boys, Brian and Michael, alone.
[time=2498] And I remember Steve looked at him and said, "Jim, they won't be alone.
[time=2501] Not only will they have the Lord, but they'll have us." And that has really been true since that day.
[time=2509] They have been there for us each step of the way.
[time=2512] During the three years that Jim battled his cancer, they were there to encourage us.
[time=2518] They were there to pray for us very specifically about the things that we shared that we were dealing with and needed prayer and needed God's answers in our lives.
[time=2527] They helped us keep our eyes on the Lord.
[time=2530] They built up our faith when our faith was waning.
[time=2533] When you suffer some significant suffering, that is something as Christians, yes, that we even do and to have somebody there to pray when you can't even pray is a wonderful thing.
[time=2545] They laughed with us.
[time=2546] They cried with us.
[time=2549] And in Jim's final weeks at home, he had five weeks of hospice in the home.
[time=2554] They brought meals to us every day.
[time=2556] They had their own meals to make for their families, but that didn't matter.
[time=2560] They cared for ours.
[time=2562] They called us.
[time=2563] They sent notes.
[time=2564] They ran errands.
[time=2566] They came over to our home and prayed and read God's word and sang hymns of praise and were
[time=2573] Jesus's hands and hearts to us.
[time=2577] They even took shifts, that third shift, when you care for a person who is dying, they don't
[time=2584] often sleep in the middle of the night and they still have needs.
[time=2586] And so they let me go back to what we refer to as the Hilton and get some sleep so that
[time=2593] they would take that shift on the sofa.
[time=2597] And you know what?
[time=2598] They're still here for me and Brian and Michael.
[time=2600] In fact, why do you think I was over there Friday night for dinner?
[time=2604] They haven't forgotten about us and I know that they won't.
[time=2607] Well, I was pondering why don't people get involved in small groups?
[time=2613] And I was thinking probably maybe one of the reasons is lack of time.
[time=2618] I'm too busy doing this or that.
[time=2621] I think another reason might be that we're afraid of sharing life at that level with other people.
[time=2626] In fact, it reminded me in the song we were singing here today, "Jesus wants us to remember
[time=2633] this.
[time=2634] Take me as you find me, all my fears and failures." And that's really what sharing life together is.
[time=2642] We're all sinners.
[time=2643] None of us are perfect.
[time=2645] And we take each other as we are.
[time=2647] We pray and build up and walk alongside and somehow in all of that, God works and He
[time=2653] perfects us.
[time=2654] And that's a wonderful thing.
[time=2658] And I think the third reason that I thought of is some people just might say, "I don't need that." But I really want you to understand that's really not true.
[time=2667] God designed us first to be dependent on Him, but then to be interdependent with each other.
[time=2674] And Romans 12, 4 says, "Just as each of us has one body with many members and these
[time=2680] members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body
[time=2688] and each member belongs to all of the others." Well in small groups, we get to fulfill our part in the body.
[time=2698] And it's a wonderful thing.
[time=2699] We bring different gifts, different personalities, different experiences with God.
[time=2705] In our group I love it because we have some of us that are older and we have some younger ones.
[time=2711] And so we're sharing life together.
[time=2713] We're hoping to impart some wisdom for the years that we've lived to the younger ones and they impart to us what they bring and it's a wonderful time of sharing and caring.
[time=2722] And lastly, I want to encourage you with this.
[time=2725] And you and I are living life together at that level.
[time=2730] It is a powerful witness to a watching world and I experience that and I'm just so thankful
[time=2738] and I want to praise God here today with you that my sister came to faith, having spent
[time=2744] those five weeks here with me and watching us be loved and watching Christ and His body
[time=2751] at work.
[time=2752] And I can praise God for that.
[time=2755] Well are you experiencing this level of relationship with other believers in your life?
[time=2762] You know we can't be all things to all people.
[time=2765] In fact there's probably many of you in this gathering who didn't even know me or know that we went through that and I wouldn't expect you to in a large body like this.
[time=2774] But there should be some and there were and I'm so grateful to God for that.
[time=2780] But if not, if you're not experiencing that, I would encourage you first to pray for the desire if you don't have it yet.
[time=2787] And then secondly to pray and ask God to bring you a group of people that He has for you.
[time=2793] Handpicked that you can do life like that with.
[time=2798] And for those of us who are in that kind of relationship with others in the church, I
[time=2804] want to encourage you because it's not always easy.
[time=2806] I'm sure those five weeks, my group of people that cared for me and Jim, they got tired
[time=2812] and they got weary and it wasn't easy, it was sacrificial.
[time=2818] And so I leave you with Galatians 6, 9 and 10.
[time=2822] Let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if
[time=2829] we do not give up.
[time=2831] And therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those
[time=2837] who belong to the family of believers.
[time=2840] When you're part of gatherings in groups, you should be challenged to go.
[time=2858] And one of the ways that God does that is just by internally imparting to you His passion
[time=2867] to go and to love.
[time=2869] Because as you become more Christ-like, the going is inevitable.
[time=2874] But also the gatherings and the groups build you up to send you out and go.
[time=2879] We wanted to close today's service with just an opportunity to extend to you.
[time=2886] And it's kind of a form of going.
[time=2889] Today is Compassion Sunday, I don't know if that title means anything to you, but there's an organization here in the U.S. called Compassion International and they set aside one Sunday
[time=2902] a month to just all over the United States give churches the chance to talk about this
[time=2910] concept of being compassionate toward those who are in great need.
[time=2915] And our lobby today, we have set up a booth of sorts that has kids' faces.
[time=2922] And these are kids who have great needs.
[time=2925] They need to be fed, they need to be clothed, they need to be educated.
[time=2930] And Compassion International is kind of like a hub here in the States.
[time=2934] If you give money to Compassion International and adopt a particular child, they'll make sure that the child and their family receives resources that they need to basically survive.
[time=2945] And so this morning, we didn't want to just announce this, but we wanted to kind of give you some time here to think and pray about possibly sponsoring a child for Compassion International.
[time=2957] My wife, Tanya, and I have sponsored two kids, one from El Salvador and one from India for about seven years now.
[time=2964] And the cool part about Compassion is in addition to giving about $30 a month per child to meet
[time=2970] their needs, you get to build a relationship and through correspondence, you get to build a relationship with the kids.
[time=2976] And so that's a really incredible opportunity.
[time=2978] What we're going to do is watch a video and then I'm going to invite Carrie to come and sing a song that just is a poem that kind of communicates at the heart of the poor.
[time=2988] And during the video and during the song, I just want to encourage you to pray and ask God to seek His will for you.
[time=2995] Compassion International isn't for everybody, but ask God if it's for you today and maybe ask God over these next few minutes what your next steps might be.
[time=3005] Would it be to go adopt a child today in the lobby or would it be to pray about it more and check it out online or would it be to supply maybe a one-time gift?
[time=3015] Whatever it is, just ask God to open up your heart to whatever His plans are for you in relationship to Compassion International.
[time=3022] So check out this video and I just encourage you to pray.
[time=3028] We are all the children of the world.
[time=3030] We are your children, whether you know us or not.
[time=3034] Most of us are poor, all of us are vulnerable.
[time=3038] The disease.
[time=3039] And family violence.
[time=3041] And weather.
[time=3042] And war.
[time=3044] We're not coming.
[time=3045] We're here.
[time=3046] Right in front of you.
[time=3047] Two billion of us under the age of 16.
[time=3052] We're tomorrow's parents, tomorrow's leaders, tomorrow's builders, soldiers, teachers.
[time=3061] We'll grow up to accept things as they are or change things for better or worse.
[time=3068] What difference do you think it would make if two billion children grew up with hope and not despair?
[time=3079] Change us, train us, protect and heal us, inspire us, show us how to lead and serve.
[time=3087] Give us skills for living, let us know we matter, help us, we'll have our communities.
[time=3096] When we learn to use water safely, we'll show our families how it's done.
[time=3102] We're willing to read, we'll teach our parents.
[time=3106] Help us meet Jesus, and we'll introduce some to our families and friends.
[time=3115] Give us a reason to hope, and we'll pass it on.
[time=3119] Help us grow up whole and healthy, and make a difference, and make a difference.
[time=3127] Make a difference, because whether you know us or not, we're all the children of the world.
[time=3132] We may not be your pleasure, but we're still your children.
[time=3137] Every one of us, every one of us, every one of us, and what difference do you think it
[time=3148] would make if two billion children grew up with hope and not despair?
[time=3162] I have a name, you can know it, it's been a while since anybody asked.
[time=3185] I love to laugh, just like you do, and my family also means the world to me.
[time=3200] So as you choose what to wear, remember I fight to stay warm, as you decide where to
[time=3209] eat, it's my children who mourn.
[time=3218] Think of me, let me live in your mind, keep loving me.
[time=3229] While others play blind, show true religion, 'cause words don't relieve.
[time=3239] Your actions, they heal me, show that you believe, think of me.
[time=3263] You have a life, I understand, God has blessed you, so enjoy what He has given.
[time=3277] Your hurts are real, as mine are, possessions never shield a life from earthly pain.
[time=3291] As you consider your life, would you think about mine, as you remember my tears?
[time=3301] Maybe yours disappear, think of me, let me live in your mind, keep loving me.
[time=3318] And others play blind, show true religion, 'cause words don't relieve.
[time=3327] Your actions, they heal me, show that you believe.
[time=3336] As you choose what to wear, remember I fight to stay warm, as you decide where to eat.
[time=3346] For my children who mourn, think of me, let me live in your mind, keep loving me.
[time=3363] While others play blind, show true religion, 'cause words don't relieve.
[time=3373] Your actions, they heal me, show that you believe, think of me.
[time=3392] Church I think of the head of the body, the Lord Jesus, Colossians 1 says He's the head
[time=3400] of the body, first born from among the dead.
[time=3403] I think about His Father, who sent Him here and who made Him the head of the body.
[time=3408] I think about His Spirit, who dwells in us, and empowers us to respond to the Father the
[time=3417] way we should.
[time=3421] We do that collectively in a gathering, we do that in groups with each other.
[time=3429] And He wants us to go.
[time=3433] We should be going into the body to serve.
[time=3437] We should be going outside the body.
[time=3439] I tell everybody, just serve one place in the body, and serve one place outside the body
[time=3445] to make sure that we evangelize.
[time=3449] He wants us to go.
[time=3451] He wants us to go to Him.
[time=3452] He wants us to go to people in the church.
[time=3457] He wants us to go to people that need Him in whatever way.
[time=3465] And by His grace we can, and so can you.
[time=3471] Just go.
[time=3474] It's a privilege to get to go.
[time=3478] It's an honor to get to go, we just need to go.
[time=3497] We just need to go to people, we just need to go to people that need Him in the church.
[time=3514] We just need to go to people that need Him in the church.
