[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=29] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age.
[time=49] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=55] Well, good morning everybody.
[time=63] Welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=64] We're so thankful that you've tuned in again.
[time=66] My name is Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving a senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=72] I want to say this to you first of all today, and that is a huge thanks to so many of you who, consistently, week after week, you take the time to let us hear from you.
[time=82] For others of you who maybe have thought about shooting us a line or riding us a note, giving us a call, I just want to encourage you to do so.
[time=90] You can reach us at our website, blackhawkministries.org.
[time=95] There's a place there on the home page where it says, "Contact a pastor," and we just absolutely love hearing from you.
[time=101] We love hearing about what you're learning.
[time=103] We love knowing that God's using the broadcast to encourage you in your life and your heart
[time=109] and soul.
[time=110] And so please, just do whatever you've got to do.
[time=112] Tell some friends who you know watch.
[time=115] Take some time yourself.
[time=116] Send in a note.
[time=117] We love sharing those notes with our staff, our Bible hour team, and we're really thankful for what God allows us to do each and every week.
[time=125] Hey, as far as the message you're going to hear about today, I want to just say this to you.
[time=130] I've been around long enough in life.
[time=132] I've been around long enough in ministry to know that life is full, absolutely full of challenges.
[time=138] I know many of you watching this morning are in the midst of one.
[time=143] I know that life day in and day out is absolutely stacked with the unexpected, with the difficult,
[time=149] with the painful, and as we face life, and as we try and make our way through, the scriptures
[time=155] remind us that it's complicated as it can be at times.
[time=159] I mean, as difficult as it is for you and I at times to make our way through, the Bible
[time=165] reminds us there is a fundamental principle that kind of oversees the whole thing, and that is this, that when you love God, really, the Bible says that when you love God, and
[time=177] then when out of that love for Him, you're willing to love others, Jesus said the whole
[time=183] of Scripture, all of God's truth is wrapped up in two things, loving Him, really loving
[time=190] Him, and really, really loving others, and I just want to encourage you that when you
[time=196] and I are facing all that life throws at us, it's really good sometimes to be reminded that the road, there are many options, the road through all of those challenges and heartaches
[time=209] is a growing love for God and a willingness to love and give ourselves away to others,
[time=215] and that's what we'll be teaching on, that's what we'll be giving some time to in the next few Sundays.
[time=221] I hope you'll continue to tune in.
[time=223] I met a couple last week who finally came on a Sunday morning having watched the Bible Hour for a couple of years, and we love getting the chance to meet you in person.
[time=232] Hope you'll enjoy this morning, and I hope you'll open your heart to greater levels, more meaningful levels of love, faithfulness, and devotion to Him.
[time=241] Thank you for tuning in, we hope to see you soon.
[time=244] Eric's playing with me this morning, just filling in on the acoustic, and I'm so grateful for the talents that God has given him, but I'm even more grateful about the way that
[time=256] God transformed Eric's life, so that he could use the gifts God's given him for God's Kingdom.
[time=264] And instead of for his own glory, for his own fame, and that song "How Do I Come?"
[time=272] I just thought maybe, Eric, maybe you could just answer that question for us.
[time=278] How do I come or how did you come into this Kingdom of Marvelous Light?
[time=284] Christ rescued you from the dominion of darkness.
[time=287] I mean, He set you free, and I just thought maybe you could explain in your own words
[time=293] what that was like for you to be brought into His Kingdom.
[time=298] Absolutely.
[time=299] You know, as we were just saying in that last song, the words "Wretched, Poor, and Blind,"
[time=308] never, never were so meaningful.
[time=313] Thinking about how meaningful the word "Wretched" was, or is to me because it's a picture in
[time=323] the past.
[time=324] "Wretched" is such a good word to describe the way things were.
[time=330] A lot of you know, some of you may not, and I've been involved in music most of my life.
[time=336] And for a long period of time, I was in rock bands and played locally and toured and had
[time=345] access to all of those things that a weak-minded person, weak-hearted person at the time, like
[time=355] myself, should not have had access to.
[time=357] And I'm here to tell you, young folks, it'll take you down a dark, dark path, and it may
[time=367] not seem like you're going down a dark path until you turn around and look, and you see
[time=373] no light behind you and no light in front of you.
[time=377] So there was many, many years where I wasted all of this talent that God had given me.
[time=386] And even though there were times where there were thousands of people in the room, and the
[time=392] lights were on and the party was going, sometimes you just feel so alone.
[time=400] And so one thing led to another, and I went further and further down, and pretty soon
[time=406] I bottomed out.
[time=407] I just couldn't go any further without going into great detail, it's just suffice to say.
[time=413] Just can't get any further down, psychologically, emotionally, spiritually for sure.
[time=423] And in my case, that's what it took.
[time=426] I had to get to rock bottom before I even knew there was another direction, the other way.
[time=434] And so I came to a point in my life where I couldn't do anything, I couldn't control anything, I couldn't take care of anything, I couldn't fix anything.
[time=444] And I remembered, I remembered vacation bible school, and I remembered my old church and
[time=450] my old pastors, and I think that was a seed plan a long time ago that eventually, under
[time=458] those conditions, it blossomed, and I just laid myself out on the ground, and just gave
[time=469] up.
[time=470] I said, "God, I can't do it anymore, and I need you." And that was a big change, that was the start of a big change.
[time=478] There was many, many people in my lives, many mistakes, many falls, many times I stumbled.
[time=488] But stumbling and falling with Christ is much, much better than stumbling and falling with
[time=495] no bottom.
[time=498] And so here I am today, and I feel so blessed to be in a place like this and to be able to
[time=504] use my talents and gifts, all from the blood of Christ.
[time=510] Thanks.
[time=515] The verse of the song we're going to sing says this, and I think it's so appropriate.
[time=522] The Last Verse says, "I still remember the day you saved me.
[time=526] The day, God, I heard you call out my name.
[time=530] You said you loved me, you said you never leave me, and I'll never be the same again."
[time=539] I just want to encourage you, as we sing this song, to remember, remember what God has brought
[time=545] you from, and to just worship Him out of a heart of gratitude for the way He's rescued
[time=551] you.
[time=552] Here, why don't you get us started.
[time=565] We will remember, we will remember the works of your hands, and we will stop and give you
[time=578] praise for great is thy faithfulness.
[time=587] We will remember, we will remember the works of your hands, and we will stop and give you
[time=604] praise for great is thy faithfulness.
[time=612] You know, as Eric was sharing his story, I know for a fact that one of the things that
[time=618] song just said, we're going to remember the works of his hand.
[time=622] God does amazing things as he brings people to himself.
[time=625] One of the great works that God did with Eric was that at his workplace, he brought
[time=631] a man into his life named Jim McCraady, and many of you know Jim, you knew him, Jim went
[time=640] to be with the Lord several months ago, and Jim was a priest at work, and in his priestly
[time=650] opportunity, he met Eric, and he encouraged Eric, and God used others, but God used Jim in a big way, and I wonder if he just would take a moment, I wonder who God used with you.
[time=662] I wonder who that was, that he brought into your life.
[time=666] Maybe it was a mother, a father, a grandmother, maybe it was a friend at school, maybe it was
[time=672] a co-worker, maybe it was a good friend.
[time=679] I want you just to think for a moment about that, and let's just sing that chorus prayerfully and thoughtfully, a commitment to remember the works of his hands, and as you sing it, thank God for him, or for her, thank God for that individual, or individuals that he used
[time=694] in bringing you to himself, thank him for them, let's just sing that prayerfully to him,
[time=701] we will remember you, remember, we will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works
[time=716] of your hands, we will stop, and give you praise for great is thy faithfulness.
[time=734] Thank you for the great works of your hand that bring us to yourself, God, to your saving
[time=741] grace and life in you, thank you for the people that you've used in our lives.
[time=746] And God, may we be used of you in the lives of others.
[time=753] May we be faithful so that they could remember someday your faithfulness.
[time=759] God, thank you for this privilege of worship and this privilege of being together in your son's name we pray, and all the people agreed and said, amen, you can have a seat.
[time=769] Thank you, Corbin, thank you so much, Eric.
[time=771] Hey, it's good to be together, good to see all of you.
[time=775] I am really, really looking forward to these next couple of weeks.
[time=780] We will be over the next two to three weeks just engaged in what I'm just simply calling a fundamental and foundational study, you know, every once in a while when you think about this great privilege that God has given us in the church today, when you think about this great calling that he has placed on your life and mine to be priests, to be people
[time=798] who pass along God to a world and culture that desperately needs it.
[time=803] When you think about the church, being what the church is designed by God to be, there are times where we need to come back, I think, and just look again at some very, very fundamental
[time=814] truths that really give us guidance and clarity on what our ministry and what our lives are
[time=820] to look like.
[time=821] And we're going to do that beginning here this morning and again over the next two to three weeks, somewhere in mid to late May, I want to let you know this, I'm really looking forward to this.
[time=830] I feel a bit daunting, I feel a little overwhelmed by it, I'm going to give it a shot, I've gone ahead and just kind of jumped in, I've declared before God I'm going to do this, I've never done this in over 20 years of ministry, I'm going to try my best and we'll engage the
[time=844] other guys as well along the way.
[time=846] And we're going to do our best to teach you a series, I have no idea what we're going to call it, I don't know how long it's going to last, but we are going to do our best to teach on heaven.
[time=858] Heaven is something that many of us for years, you know, I can go back to days when I was
[time=864] just a boy, you know, and you can probably go back to times when you were young and you would ask questions about heaven and oftentimes in our youth especially, we would ask very
[time=874] specific questions, I just remember maybe my experience wasn't yours, but I remember so
[time=880] many times people telling me something along the lines of this as it related to my questions about heaven, well we just don't know, you know, we're just not really sure and they
[time=892] would even say the Bible doesn't really say a whole lot about what that's going to be like and so we were left most of us our whole lives to kind of have these pictures of heaven
[time=902] that by and large included angels, clouds and robes and if I were to ask you what else
[time=911] most of you would be hard pressed, true?
[time=916] I mean what's it really going to be like, who goes, when, what does it entail, am I going
[time=924] to heaven or am I going to the new Jerusalem or am I going to the new earth or am I going
[time=930] to all three or do I have a body in heaven or do I have a body in the new earth or do I not have a body in the new earth and a body, I mean so many times we start going down these roads and there's just so many questions and you know what, I am not hearing me, we're not going to answer them all because there is some mystery about heaven, praise God,
[time=950] but I believe there is some clarity for us in our attempts to understand what God means
[time=956] as He speaks about and talks about this place called heaven, this place of dwelling with
[time=962] Him for all of eternity and we're going to dig in all right and we're going to just begin to look at that and I hope you'll be here, I hope you'll bring your friends, I hope you'll bring family members, I hope you'll bring folks who you know might be interested in a real biblical study of what that is all about and how we might can understand that better.
[time=978] So that's coming.
[time=980] Today I want to just jump into something that I think is very, very foundational, I think every once in a while we just need to come back to some very clear basics and as I do that this morning I want to just start by just sharing with you some things, I find myself very, very, very encouraged about as it relates to you and this family and this ministry God's
[time=1000] given us and what we get the privilege of being a part of in the day to day around here
[time=1006] at Blackhawk and I want to start with a group of people.
[time=1009] I'm thankful for all of you, I hope you know that, I really am, there is a very unique
[time=1015] segment of you that I find myself in recent days so very, very thankful for and that
[time=1021] is those of you who would fall into that category of senior adult and I know some of
[time=1027] you are at peace with being in the category of senior adult and I know others of you would
[time=1033] rather not be included in it so whatever, 55, 60, 65, we've got 60 year olds and 70 year
[time=1041] olds and 80 year olds, I mean we've got some people who have seen some life and they continue
[time=1047] to be a segment of people here in our family and in most churches it is that segment of folks that complain the most.
[time=1056] In most churches it's that segment of people who are the biggest heartache and frustration
[time=1062] for someone in my position and I'm just here to tell you that in this case in this family our senior adult community here is not, they are a source of probably my greatest encouragement,
[time=1075] they continue to faithfully speak into my life, they continue to faithfully speak into the lives of many others in this family, they serve faithfully, many, many senior adults are greeters, I mean raise your hand if you've been greeted by or had a door open for you or a bulletin given you by a senior adult in this place, absolutely, they do it willingly, they do it cheerfully, I'm now in the process of more and more so we're finding senior adults
[time=1100] who are wanting to join small groups, senior adults who are willing to go and be a part of a small group with people younger, young kids, single adults, we've got senior adults
[time=1112] willing now to go and be a part of small communities in living rooms where they know they can be used of God just simply by their presence but even more so by the wisdom that God has
[time=1124] given them and their willingness to share that with us, those of us that need it desperately, I'm so thankful for our legacy ministry, so thankful for Dave Rondo and the team that gives leadership to legacy, our senior adult ministry that isn't just about senior adults gathering, it's about senior adults serving, it's about senior adults being encouraged, it's about senior adults going on short term missions trips, I'm so thankful for our ABFs,
[time=1149] you know we have several ABFs, adult Bible fellowships, classes that meet on Sunday morning, several of those have a high population of senior adults, I think about Neil and Von Clay and those that help with the discovery class, I think about Mike and Kathy Rowland who help give leadership and coin a knee, I think about John Summer who teaches along with Keith Brown and in settings where there are senior adults who are actively involved in ministering their gifts and encouraging others, I'm so thankful for the encouragement that that group continues
[time=1180] to bring to this place, I'm thankful for what we've been through the last few months when
[time=1187] we talk about being priests that pass along God to others and while I'm thankful on the
[time=1193] priestly front for the local priestly opportunities you and I have in the workplace and with family
[time=1199] to pass along God to others, I want to tell you this, I'm also encouraged about the global opportunity that God's giving you and I to be priests, I'm encouraged by that, Brenheimer,
[time=1210] our global ministries pastor, Dave Walters, our encounter pastor myself will board a plane the 16th of June for Nairobi, Kenya, I mentioned this to you a few weeks ago, we'll be going to Nairobi for four days to further establish and solidify a relationship there with an orphanage, an orphanage in Nairobi that has satellite sites all over the country and they're about mainly one thing, they're about trying to save abandoned babies, newborns, most of
[time=1236] whom have been infected with AIDS who are at a rate of 300 per day abandoned, these mothers
[time=1246] are giving birth in huts and taking babies wrapped in garbage bags and throwing them
[time=1252] on refuse heaps and garbage sites and leaving them and oftentimes they're found and taken
[time=1260] to this place where they are given medical attention and nutrition attention and they're
[time=1267] held by those that are there willing to hold them and we're going to go and establish
[time=1273] a relationship there, Bren's been already working on that and we're hoping in the next fall probably in September to begin taking teams of you who would be willing to go and to pass on God's compassion and love and at the same time June 9th you heard me say this
[time=1289] before June 9th we're calling it the generous living garage sale and if you'll cooperate
[time=1295] with me I believe it will be the world's largest garage sale ever in the history of
[time=1301] the world and we're really looking forward to it, we're going to have a lot of information for you next week about it June 9th I mean it's going to be an absolute kick we're going to get you and you're going to get everybody's going to get all their stuff and we're going to encourage our friends and the folks that we work with we're going to just gather as much stuff as we can, sell it and all the proceeds are going to go to two things basically we're going to help drill some water wells over in eastern Africa for some people who don't have water to drink and we're going to take some of the other funds from the garage
[time=1336] sale and come alongside and help feed and clothe and encourage refugees right here in Fort Wayne one of the largest refugee populations in the United States is in Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=1347] I don't know if you knew that but we've got people who are intricately involved in that
[time=1353] endeavor and we can't wait to support it I'm thankful for the Bible hour I'm so encouraged by the Bible hour I'm telling you I don't get it I sometimes I don't understand it but boy I tell you what people just God does an amazing thing with that broadcast raise your hand if you know somebody who watches the Bible hour or you know somebody who got here because they watch the Bible hour I mean it's incredible to me I mean I just got this handed to me
[time=1379] this week I was so encouraging I couldn't wait to tell you about it this is a membership application and they brought it in and put it on my desk and I'm reading through it and
[time=1388] at the bottom it says please list your main reasons for coming to Blackhawk and this gal writes the need to hear and better understand the word of God the need to be immersed in
[time=1398] the word of God to be cleansed by it the need to pass on the word of God pass on catch the
[time=1404] verbiage there the need to pass on the word of God to my daughter son grandchildren and others the way the scripture is taught at Blackhawk touches my heart and soul it's made me excited to rejoice in Jesus again and hopefully forever just above that it asks how long have you
[time=1423] been attending our church and in the blank she writes two weeks and then underneath the
[time=1430] two weeks in parenthesis two years I've been watching the Bible hour for two years I got
[time=1440] a kick out of this one question above that if you're not baptized by immersion would you be willing to be baptized by immersion in the blank she writes totally totally willing
[time=1451] watching the Bible hour for two years met a couple the other day I was getting ready to leave the office it was a little late everybody was gone the lights were out and I came out of my office and lo and behold there's a couple sitting there on the couch like they're waiting for an appointment and there's nobody around and they looked really really glad to be there and so I just said hi to them and they were encouraged I think to be able to meet me and talk to me and I was encouraged to be able to meet them and talk with them and they said they hadn't been around very long but that they in a couple months had realized that they really probably should join what we call a small group so they were there to meet with Josh rang about joining a small group I asked a few more questions lo and behold they've just been here a few months but had been for a couple of years watching the what the Bible hour encouraged week in and week out a lot of things I'm so
[time=1502] thankful for if you were to ask me is there anything that you're concerned about I would
[time=1509] say yes I am not a real you know pessimistic person I'm pretty optimistic the last is always
[time=1517] full not even half full it's full but you know what I am concerned and I'm concerned
[time=1523] for you and I'm concerned for me I see some things in me and I continue to see some things
[time=1531] in you I can I continue to see things in the church my friends yes I mean you yes I mean
[time=1538] me I see things in the church today that concern me and you know as I think about what concerns
[time=1545] me if you began to say okay write some things out Kelly I mean you you see our lives and you watch what we do I mean what is it about us that concerns you as I start to write those
[time=1556] things out as I did this week and as I started to write those things out that concern me about me it became very clear very quickly that those are pretty much symptoms I mean those
[time=1569] are while important those really when you look at it they come back to a very very central issue and it is a central issue it is a central very important concern that I have that has
[time=1584] been around for a long long long time everywhere you look in Scripture wherever you see this
[time=1591] issue wherever you see this ball getting dropped wherever you see people failing in this one
[time=1599] endeavor you see trouble you see destruction you see discouragement you see God's glory
[time=1612] and God's great endeavor the church I mean you see what is true and right and good taking
[time=1619] a hit wherever you see this one issue surface and if you were to ask me what my real concern
[time=1628] for you and I today as a family as a church in this world in this culture I would say to you this I'd probably phrase it this way infidelity infidelity in our love for God infidelity
[time=1644] in our love for God oftentimes the phrase infidelity just gets immediately associated
[time=1650] with marriage but I want to remind you that God's word is absolutely filled with examples
[time=1656] where God again and again characterizes his relationship with his people and his love
[time=1664] for his people and their love for him so many times he uses the picture of marriage to describe that and whatever you might want to call it infidelity in our love for God not loving
[time=1675] God unfaithfulness if you want to just move to the vernacular of our day and say one of the great concerns is your propensity in mind to cheat on God however you want to say that
[time=1689] I think it's really really important periodically for you and I to come back to this foundational issue of do we love him deeply really personally faithfully our love for God you might ask
[time=1706] how would you ever determine that Kelly if you were looking at my life you might say how would you assess my love for God well I would assess your love for God the same way I would hope you would assess my love for God see we look at each other's lives Jesus
[time=1722] said if you love me you will keep my what my commandments we will live lives of obedience
[time=1728] if I want to understand the quality or the depth of your love for God I'm going to look at your your energies and where they're spent I'm going to look at your passions and your priorities and your commitments I'm going to look at your resources your gifts and your talents and how all of that is spent I'm going to look at the total and you're going to look at the total of my life our lives and they will give evidence to what we or
[time=1752] who we love I would dare to say to you it's really not that complicated for me to look
[time=1761] at your life for you to look at mine and to begin to figure out what it is I'm most
[time=1768] or who it is I'm most passionate about what the greatest commitment in me is and what
[time=1775] I care most about and I think that's good for you and I to give thought to our love for
[time=1785] God you know there really is a great picture painted in scripture of his love for us and the picture of a marriage the picture of a husband and wife boy he uses it all through
[time=1797] scripture I'll never forget being maybe just six months into the first church I was ever at one of the very first weddings I ever did I had the privilege of meeting this gal
[time=1808] and this guy they were a part of that church had recently become a part of that church and
[time=1814] their story was amazing she was for years and years and years probably seven or eight
[time=1822] years she worked the streets that was what she did she was a street walker and when she
[time=1832] wasn't walking the streets trying to earn some money she was a dancer for years she
[time=1838] had been engaged in prostitution and dancing is what she did she was lost broken confused
[time=1850] and in the midst of all that she had two kids three ex-husbands all of which had left her
[time=1856] feeling worthless empty and without hope then some Christ following friends who had faithfully
[time=1864] been passing along God to her she'd met some gals they knew the Lord they were a part of
[time=1870] this church they weren't put off by what she did they weren't afraid of who she was they
[time=1876] loved her with great passion and energy they were unconditional in their acceptance of
[time=1882] her and they invited her to come one Sunday and join us as we met she came a couple of Sundays two or three times then she fully surrenders her heart her broken bruised heart
[time=1893] she fully surrenders it to Christ having fully surrendered her heart to Christ she joins
[time=1899] these three gals and five others in a small group in that small group she experiences what she had never ever before experienced in her life not only a growing love for God and his growing commitment to her but the fellowship and the accountability and the love that they offered her the support and the involvement that they gave it absolutely God used it to transform this woman's life she met a guy about two years later and it was
[time=1925] the first guy she had ever known or met that had ever wanted to love her to honor her
[time=1936] and to do his very best to treat her as Christ would treat the church it was an amazing thing
[time=1943] they met they dated I had a chance to meet with them and here's what I remember two things as we would meet in the months and weeks leading up to the wedding she kept saying over and over and over see this guy knew this guy knew where she had been and she kept saying to
[time=1959] me over and over again I can't believe he loves me she'd like leave meetings she'd just
[time=1967] be crying say are you okay she's yeah I just you know I can't believe he loves me and then
[time=1977] there was that day at the altar I'll never forget this one of the great wedding memories of my my life so far is we're doing this wedding and the place is packed and they say
[time=1987] their vows and the vows are over and it's time to move on but she buries her head veil and all she just buries her head in his chest she won't let go and she's just weeping and
[time=1998] she's got her face turned to me the microphone is on his other lapel so nobody heard it and
[time=2004] she just stood there with her face against his chest and he's got his arms around her and she says kind of just you know it wasn't like she was just saying it to me but she says looking at me there's no place I'd rather be no place in the world I'd rather be than
[time=2020] right here and then she looks up and says I love you to him and it was one of the most
[time=2028] special I think most incredible pictures of what goes on there not only in a in a in a
[time=2036] wedding but in the way that God gives himself and the way that God loves us it's hands down
[time=2043] one of the great pictures of his redeeming grace filled love that he offers you and I
[time=2052] broken empty sin stained people far from God he knew you remember that he knew you he knew
[time=2059] all that you had done he knew all the places you'd been he knew all the choices you made and he loved you the scriptures teach clearly that we are the bride of the Lord and that
[time=2069] he is the bride groom Ephesians 5 31 you can turn there you can look at it on the screen
[time=2076] Ephesians 5 31 just says it so clearly for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.
[time=2087] Ephesians 5 31 32 says this mystery is great but I am speaking with reference to Christ
[time=2094] and the what all of that verbiage there in Ephesians 5 yes completely and totally obviously
[time=2101] about a man and a woman coming together God's designed for marriage yes he says this mystery
[time=2108] is great but here's the point he says all of that is really fundamentally about you and
[time=2114] I and the marriage relationship that I have with you as the groom you being my bride they're
[time=2123] the Lord stands at the altar pictured they're the Lord himself stands at the altar with you
[time=2129] deeply devoted to sacrifice for you to protect you to invest in you cherish and nourishes
[time=2136] bride you he commits the deepest and most faithful love he has to you and we should be I believe
[time=2144] we should be you should be today absolutely floored by that my fear is that you're not
[time=2157] my fear is that we we keep moving down this road doing what we're all doing engaged in
[time=2164] all that we're engaged in and that we gradually slowly but surely move away from what should
[time=2173] just floor you that he loves you that much and that he is that devoted and that committed
[time=2182] to you we should stand there at the altar in his arm saying I can't believe you love me
[time=2189] there's no place I'd rather be than right here content and satisfied in simply and only you
[time=2197] I love you see I bump into too many people who walk around acting as if God's lucky to have them
[time=2204] when in reality we should just be in awe I can't believe that you love me I can't believe you wanted
[time=2214] me I can't believe you married me I can't believe you pursued me it should just absolutely floor
[time=2224] you and see the Lord knows that that in that place of awe and commitment to him he knows
[time=2231] that that is exactly where we should be and it's why when they asked our Lord to summarize
[time=2237] all of this when they asked him what the most important stuff in here was he said clearly
[time=2244] number one first greatest command love who love God love me love me love me love me love me you
[time=2258] want to know what's most important in this you want to know what ties all of this together you know what should stand out over and above everything else in all of this and in all of your life the
[time=2269] most important thing should be that you would love me and if that sounds to anybody maybe a little
[time=2277] borderline egotistical understand it's not it's the one of the greatest acts of love him saying that to you and I him asking that of you that you would love him deeply and faithfully see because
[time=2290] bottom line he knows something bottom line he knows what happens when you don't he has seen that he
[time=2301] has experienced that when you don't love him deeply you go somewhere else and I'll remind you
[time=2312] this morning that never ever ever goes well everybody hear that when the enemy offers you
[time=2323] another opportunity to love elsewhere as nice as he may make it look as exciting as it may seem
[time=2333] it never goes well I want to show you a passage this morning that brings to light this very truth
[time=2343] turn with me if you were to Jeremiah chapter two we're going to start in verses one through eight this morning really is a very sad passage it is a tragic picture of love that has been
[time=2355] displaced a waning or fading love for God Jeremiah chapter two verses one to eight I know we're a
[time=2363] little late in the morning but still I feel like we should honor God's word we're not done we've got some more things to do this morning here yet but would you stand just in honor of God's word I think it's important that we do so and let me read the Jeremiah two one to eight our love for God God's people and their love for him and how all this
[time=2386] comes together now the word of the Lord came to me Jeremiah two verse one saying go and proclaim
[time=2392] in the ears of Jerusalem saying thus says the Lord here here is a prophecy God wanting to get a word
[time=2399] to his people Jeremiah will now speak this word on God's behalf and what God says is this God says
[time=2405] I remember concerning you my people the devotion of your youth what does he mean by the devotion
[time=2412] of your youth well there it is next line the love of your betrotals the love of your betrotals see
[time=2419] there there's this picture that got pincer of of this almost like this romantic love this engagement
[time=2426] this this I loved you and you loved me and we were in that love betrothed there was this commitment
[time=2433] and he says I remember the love of your betrotals you you're following after me in the wilderness through a land not sown
[time=2448] Israel was holy to the Lord the first of his harvest all who ate of it became guilty evil came
[time=2455] upon them declares the Lord stop there here's this picture of love I mean I loved you it was
[time=2463] like we were betrothed you followed me wherever I took you anybody gave you a bad time I dealt with
[time=2470] them I mean we were tight here the word of the Lord oh house of Jacob and all the families of the
[time=2480] house of Israel thus says the Lord here's where it gets sad picture God saying this what injustice
[time=2487] did your father's find in me that they went far from me and walked after emptiness and became
[time=2497] empty what injustice did your father's finding me somebody with an niv read that verse out loud
[time=2505] to me right now what fault did your father's find in me God's going hey what did I do
[time=2524] what what fault did you find in me well what injustice did you find in me I thought I provided
[time=2532] for you I thought I led you I thought I loved you I thought I met your every need I thought I rescued
[time=2538] you from Egypt that you would walk after emptiness and become empty they did not say they used to
[time=2550] now they did not say where is the Lord who brought us out of the land of Egypt who led us through the wilderness through a land of deserts and of pits through a land of drought and of deep darkness through a land but no one crossed and were no man dwelt I brought you into the fruitful
[time=2565] land to eat its fruit its good things but you came and defiled my land and my inheritance and
[time=2571] you made an abomination the priests even did not say what where is the Lord
[time=2581] Father God we stand and just pray that you would continue here in these moments to
[time=2587] allow each of us to think honestly about our love and our devotion
[time=2595] and our commitment to you most in the room would want genuinely God to be faithful to you
[time=2602] God I pray that you would help us that you would move us in that direction revealing and exposing
[time=2609] whatever might need to be revealed or exposed God giving us hope and encouragement as to how it is
[time=2616] we could live and choose in ways that would express our faithfulness to you not our unfaithfulness
[time=2623] God thank you for your word and thank you for the insights and the encouragement and the direction
[time=2629] it brings in your son's name we pray amen well let me just you can have a seat let me just take you back to verses one and three real quick because I think what you see there
[time=2641] is a is a great picture of love a great picture of commitment verses one to three maybe you can go
[time=2650] back to when you were first dating when you were first engaged you and I know that there was this time when we would have done anything we would have gone anywhere we would have jumped through any hoop climbed any mountain some of us did that I mean there were times where maybe you can remember being so ready and wanting to offer yourself to her or to him that there was great commitment and
[time=2674] there was a great level of patience and you would have endured anything each of you in your efforts
[time=2681] but then something happens something happens and what I want to show you here what I want to point
[time=2688] out to you is what took place there in verse six and you might even want to underline it because
[time=2694] I think it's so very important they did not say verse six they did not say where is the Lord
[time=2703] you know what that means my friends it means they stopped seeking him please write that down
[time=2710] please make note of that they stopped seeking him in the Hebrew there where it talks about
[time=2716] where is the Lord and this sense of seeking that whole idea in the original language talks about
[time=2722] a a it indicates a passionate and primary he was at one time their passionate and primary pursuit
[time=2731] think about the passionate and primary pursuits in your life today there was a time here in the scriptures where with the people of Israel God was their passionate and their primary pursuit
[time=2743] he is what they were about he was what they were after he was where they longed to be
[time=2749] passionate and primary pursuit now we come to this point here as Jeremiah proclaims the word of the
[time=2756] Lord and they've stopped seeking him they've stopped pursuing the Lord
[time=2764] no more back to verse back to verse two no more following after me you see that
[time=2773] hey my friends let me just say it to you this way we'll bring it back to them
[time=2782] the analogy that so many of us would be familiar with do you understand what happens to your heart
[time=2789] do you understand what goes on in a human soul when a husband stops pursuing his wife
[time=2801] several months ago many of us were in this room at the love and respect conference where Dr.
[time=2809] Egrich in such a powerful way just clearly took from the words of Ephesians 5 this concept of how in God's design God designed it for husbands to love sacrificially like Christ loved the church
[time=2823] husbands are to love sacrificially pursue their wives it's how God designed it that's how hearts
[time=2831] stay full that's how people in this case wives are loved he also was very clear that wives
[time=2839] in God's design are to respect their husbands and he was really clear because the scriptures
[time=2845] are really clear that none of that activity husbands loving their wives like Christ loved the church or wives respecting or honoring their husbands none of it none of it it's conditional
[time=2857] none of that love that a husband's to give a wife is because the wife deserves it because the wife's in a good mood or because the wife makes it easy for him to do so none of it
[time=2868] none of the respect or honor that in God's design a wife is to offer her husband is to is to be earned or merited no no no you're to give it because that's God's design that you
[time=2879] would honor him that you would affirm him that you would be encouraging to him that you would pat him
[time=2885] on the back that you would thank him for his efforts as flawed and as failed as they might be
[time=2893] and when you stop respecting your husband when you stop loving your wife when spouses stop being
[time=2902] pursued you understand what happens left to ourselves hear me now left to ourselves
[time=2916] will go somewhere else to get the respect left to ourselves will go somewhere else
[time=2925] to get loved that's just how that goes and it doesn't go well
[time=2935] because therein outside of God's design lies nothing but emptiness destruction and despair
[time=2944] so hopefully in the midst of the challenge there we know the Lord because in knowing the Lord
[time=2950] though we may not be respected knowing the Lord though we may not be being loved sacrificially we can rest in him find great hope and courage to move forward but that's what happens
[time=2964] we we sometimes in our humanness when we're in the midst of that hurt and that emptiness and that
[time=2973] pain it oftentimes leads to the tragic reality of what we might call and I just use that
[time=2980] I'm just going to use the terminology of the text and I want to show you here where it talks about this oftentimes in the midst of our marital disappointment and hurt it leads to what we might
[time=2992] call a marital trade-in literally we want a new model we're done
[time=3000] this model isn't doing it for me anymore I'm tired of the disappointment I'm tired of the pain
[time=3008] don't like this model she or he isn't cooperating with what I need when I need it and how I want it
[time=3015] they've become difficult or disappointing like a major like a major league ball club I want to trade
[time=3023] and it gets kind of just you know whittled down to something that base and and gross God says
[time=3031] that's exactly what Israel did with him I don't know if you know that it's the wording here look at Jeremiah 10 11 truly shocking when you just realize all that God has done and then you come
[time=3042] to 11 and it says has a nation changed God's Jeremiah 211 has a nation changed God's when
[time=3051] when they were not gods but my people have changed or exchanged their glory for that which does not
[time=3059] profit they traded me in he says how could they do that what did I do to deserve that I mean they
[time=3069] literally just got fed up and tired with me and they think they can just exchange gods we think we can just exchange spouses and somehow it's just all going to be better on the other side
[time=3082] look at Psalm I think it's Psalm 119 let me just I love the wording here it just brings to bear I
[time=3088] think it brings to light just the absurdity of it all Psalm 106 sorry Psalm 106 verses 19 to 22
[time=3096] they made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a molten image thus they exchanged there's that same word
[time=3105] they exchanged they traded in God they exchanged their glory for the image of an ox that eats grass
[time=3113] I mean I think he's just kind of pointing out for you there the absurdity of it all a molten image that eats grass they forgot God their Savior who had done great things in Egypt
[time=3127] wonders in the land of Ham and awesome things by the Red Sea well I want to bring you back I want to bring you back to this idea of exchanging the glory of God
[time=3142] for that which does not profit we're going to come back to that next week but I want to read this to you I want to show you what it says in verse 12 be appalled oh heavens we'll pick it up
[time=3154] here next time look at this God says be appalled here's watch this here's the people of God
[time=3161] literally thinking in their own selfishness and in their own bent toward their own gratification
[time=3168] they think they're going to exchange God they think they're going to give up the true God and
[time=3174] go over here and find some new one that's going to bring them what they think they want and I love what it says in verse 12 it says be appalled oh heavens you see that be appalled oh heavens at this
[time=3186] and shudder as I studied that over the last couple of weeks you you come to realize that
[time=3193] where it says oh heavens he's literally it's literally as if he's talking to the heavenly hosts picture picture all of heaven picture all the angels picture all the heavenly beings who are
[time=3207] keenly aware of the love of God and how far it goes and how deep it is and how right it is he
[time=3214] says hey all of you in the heavens look at this and it's as if they look down at you and I it's
[time=3221] as if the heavens are looking down at the absolute futility of his people trying to do this exchange
[time=3229] and they shudder you know what shudder means shutters just like shutters like when you're watching
[time=3236] something from your window that your kids doing in the driveway and you know there's no way you're going to stop it and it's going to get really really bad and you're just going to have to watch it and it's going to be painful and you just kind of go oh oh oh and the heavenlies are looking down at
[time=3257] this and they're shuddering they're going you got to be kidding me you're going to do what
[time=3263] for my people have committed to evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living water
[time=3271] here is the source here is a water source that is pure here is for for for a thirsty people
[time=3278] whose souls are parched here is a fountain a spring of living water the picture is a spring
[time=3286] that never never ever dries up it's always it's always bringing forth water the water is always
[time=3292] pure it always quenches it's always there it never goes away it's it's the purest sweetest
[time=3300] most perfect water you could ever imagine in your desert experience but no
[time=3309] they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters to hue or dig for themselves cisterns
[time=3315] you know what a cistern was it was a it was a hole that they dug that they would dig by hand in rocks
[time=3328] I think I'll pass on the spring of living water because I want to go dig a hole in a rock
[time=3336] how stupid kids don't use that word at home
[time=3344] just me in this setting I get to use it how stupid of us to think that somehow we're
[time=3355] going to be better off digging holes in rocks boy that'll be better and the heavens they shudder and God goes what did I do
[time=3368] I'm right here love me love me just just love me
[time=3376] and I want to give you the life that you were designed by me to have and we're going to come
[time=3383] back and look at those two things we're going to come back next we can look at verse 13 what it means to forsake him and what it means to dig cisterns that hold no water and I hope you'll come
[time=3394] back and join us father God thanks for the morning thank you so much that you were willing to walk
[time=3401] the aisle if you would with us that you were willing to stand at the altar with all of our garbage
[time=3407] and all of our past and all of our baggage and all of our sinful tendencies and put your arms
[time=3413] around us and love us God I pray that we would love you purely and faithfully I pray that the
[time=3423] footprints in that picture on the screen this morning I pray that they would not lead us away
[time=3432] from you but God that that would be a picture of us walking toward you the giver of life
[time=3438] and where we need to confess or where we need to repent God as we come back to this passage next week I pray that you would show us that reveal that to us allow us to be people not in the midst of adultery not cheating you not trying to trade you in but God completely
[time=3455] and thoroughly given in the depths of our hearts and in the every day of life to you
[time=3462] thank you for loving us thank you for your faithfulness and be with us as we go God know that we need you desperately to face all that we will face this week give us courage
