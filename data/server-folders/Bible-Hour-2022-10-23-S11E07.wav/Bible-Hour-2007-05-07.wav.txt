[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[time=28] and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=54] While all that borrows life from thee is ever in thy care.
[time=80] And every good and good can be found on our present day.
[time=95] [AMEN]
[time=112] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I want to welcome
[time=118] you to the broadcast.
[time=119] It is good to have you with us.
[time=121] And I want to, if I can, just ask a couple questions here.
[time=124] Bear with me.
[time=125] What do you know about heaven?
[time=128] Seriously.
[time=130] What are your thoughts?
[time=132] What does your mind go?
[time=133] What do you envision when I say to you the word heaven?
[time=138] When you hear people talk about eternal life, when you and your own mind kind of contemplate what it will be like for those who know the Lord, for those who have fully surrendered their hearts and lives to Him, at the point in life at which they come to an end when their physical life ends, and the Scriptures teach that we go to be with the Lord in this
[time=159] place that He has gone to prepare for us.
[time=162] Heaven.
[time=163] What do you think of?
[time=164] You know, I think growing up in my own experience, and I think it's very consistent with a lot
[time=170] of other people that I talk to.
[time=172] I think sometimes we have this view of heaven, of clouds and harps and robes and angels,
[time=180] and I wonder if there's more to it than that.
[time=185] And I've been studying recently.
[time=187] I've been reading, like never before, about this amazing topic, this great truth called
[time=193] Heaven, and I want to invite you to something that we're going to really, really throw ourselves at in the next few weeks here.
[time=198] Beginning June 3rd, I want you to note that, write that date down, and make sure that you continue to watch the broadcast or better yet come and be with us, because on June 3rd, we begin a teaching series on Sunday mornings right here at Blackhawk called Heaven, robes,
[time=213] harps, clouds, or more.
[time=216] Maybe that's what we'll call it.
[time=218] Anyway, I want you to think about it, and I want you to understand what a significant topic this is.
[time=223] I think the way we live today, I think the way you and I approach the everyday of life
[time=230] is affected by our view of eternity, and I fear that in the church today, our view of
[time=236] eternity is really lacking.
[time=238] I think we've been misguided.
[time=240] I think there are some great truths about Heaven that you and I can't understand and see and come to know.
[time=247] So join us.
[time=248] Either watch via the broadcast or better yet come and be with us.
[time=251] We'd love to have you there.
[time=252] We're so looking forward to this great, great study, and I hope you'll consider coming.
[time=257] Hey, thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=259] I hope you have a great, great week, and God bless you, and we hope to see you soon.
[time=265] Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning our song shall rise to thee.
[time=295] Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=307] Lord God, Lord God, Lord God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God
[time=324] God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God
[time=514] This is my, you know that this is my story. This is my song. Crazy my Savior, all that they love. This is my story. This is my song. Crazy my Savior, all that they love. This is my story. This is my song.
[time=540] Grazing my Savior all day long, all day long, all day long.

[time=876] [SILENCE - 4 seconds]
[time=884] In June of 2004, I purchased the most beautiful black-and-chrome Harley-Davidson Road King Classic you've ever seen.
[time=896] Over the period of the next couple of years, Marilyn and I became friends with a number of different bikers,
[time=904] both Christian and non, and began to ride with them on a regular basis.
[time=910] We established a standing time to meet on Sunday afternoons over at Myers Parking Lot on 37,
[time=918] and whoever decided to show up that day, we would go for a couple hours ride, and then return home.
[time=926] While on May 7th of last year was just a week ago, there were ten of us that showed up that day to ride, and Marilyn and I were chosen to lead the ride that day.
[time=938] So we had decided to ride up to Auburn, and on our way home, we were coming down Tonkel Road and decided to turn toward Leo and Cedarville on DuPont Road.
[time=952] And not shortly thereafter after we made that turn, seemingly out of nowhere, just kind of in the blink of an eye, a deer slammed into the side of us as we were riding about 50 miles an hour.
[time=968] Marilyn flew over the top of me in the direction in which we were going down the pavement,
[time=974] and I slid sideways with the motorcycle after the impact
[time=980] and slid under the end of the guardrail that was along the side of the road.
[time=986] And as I came to a stop, I lifted my head and saw that the guardrail had cut me from side to side, and things that were normally inside were now outside.
[time=1000] As I laid my head back down on the pavement, Marilyn arrived at my side, along with one of our Christian biker friends who was with us that day.
[time=1012] And as the song we just sang said, they both began to call in the name of Jesus to rescue me.
[time=1020] They prayed out loud audibly until help arrived. It seemed like it wasn't very long, and an ambulance arrived, and shortly thereafter this Samaritan.
[time=1032] I was airlifted to the hospital.
[time=1036] Marilyn was taken in the ambulance, and I was in part view for about a month thereafter.
[time=1044] In addition to the cut that the guardrail had caused, the deer's impact broke my left femur.
[time=1052] Severely injured the ligaments in my right knee and fractured my left collarbone.
[time=1059] So I had one good limb, which I was very thankful for.
[time=1064] And because of that, I was able to do some very important things like feed myself,
[time=1070] and brush my teeth.
[time=1072] Pretty much everything else Marilyn had to do for me for a couple of months.
[time=1076] She was my nurse for that period of time, and nursed me back to health until the point in which I could return to work.
[time=1084] As a period of time went by, we had heard from various
[time=1090] nurses who were at the hospital, as well as a couple of the doctors that were involved, that because of the types of injuries that I had,
[time=1100] I was a miracle in the healing process and shouldn't be standing here before you as a result of those injuries.
[time=1110] But I know that there were a number of people that prayed on our behalf, and I'm here to testify this morning that just as the song said, when you call on Jesus,
[time=1124] all things are possible, that He is faithful, and that I'm thankful to be alive.
[time=1133] You know, I know God has a purpose and a plan for our lives, and the results of this accident changed my heart.
[time=1141] I was born and raised in a Christian home.
[time=1144] I accepted Christ as my Savior at the age of seven.
[time=1147] I've heard a gazillion sermons down through the years.
[time=1150] I know the Scripture.
[time=1153] And I had allowed issues in my life to just fester to a point where I became very bitter and very angry.
[time=1164] And God allowed that accident and that whole process to really convict me, and He spoke to me.
[time=1173] And I got to a point where I knew that it was sin.
[time=1177] And I went before my Lord and I asked Him to forgive me, and I went to some people and asked them to forgive me.
[time=1185] And I can honestly tell you as I stand here this morning that I don't even have a morsel of that bitterness.
[time=1192] It's gone.
[time=1193] I've been forgiven.
[time=1195] I'm restored.
[time=1197] I have a joy that I haven't had in a long, long time.
[time=1201] We are so grateful to God.
[time=1203] We saw in this whole experience His grace, His comfort, His peace,
[time=1210] His healing, His forgiveness.
[time=1212] And I want to just thank and praise Him today for what He did for us.
[time=1218] (Applause)
[time=1248] Let the children sing a song of liberation.
[time=1255] The God of our salvation set us free.
[time=1260] That where is life's being?
[time=1263] The curse of sin is broken.
[time=1266] The empty suit stands open, come and sing.
[time=1270] He's alive, alive.
[time=1273] Hallelujah, the God of praise and glory to the earth.
[time=1280] Hallelujah, the God of God.
[time=1283] Hallelujah, the God of forever again.
[time=1290] Let my heart sing out.
[time=1292] Hallelujah, the curse of one and those two.
[time=1296] So powerful and holy, rescue me.
[time=1300] So go hurt me, now hurt me, now hurt me.
[time=1303] Don't have reduced me.
[time=1305] There's no pain when I kill me.
[time=1308] Hallelujah, the God of praise and glory to the earth.
[time=1320] Hallelujah, the God of forever again.
[time=1329] Hallelujah, the God of praise and glory to the earth.
[time=1347] Hallelujah, the God of forever again.
[time=1350] Hallelujah, the earth of praise and glory to the earth.
[time=1468] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1476] Well, let me take you back, if I can, to a discussion that we've been engaged in these last several weeks, my friends.
[time=1485] We've been talking about, we have been studying and looking to the Scriptures as we always do.
[time=1490] Along the lines of a really enormous topic, and that topic is our love for God.
[time=1497] Our love for God, our love for a God who deeply loves us, our love for a God who gave up so much,
[time=1505] who is committed deeply in his heart to expressing and evidencing toward us this ongoing, everlasting love.
[time=1514] I understand the Scriptures that his love is not just a cognitive love, it's not just a mental caring for you and I know he even relates his love for us.
[time=1525] He even relates the love relationship between he and us, between us and him to marriage.
[time=1532] To all through the Scriptures, we are, as his people called in many instances, his bride.
[time=1538] The love here is deep, it's even romantic in a sense, it's that passionate.
[time=1543] And that real, and that deep.
[time=1547] In his love for us, there comes an opportunity, we've talked about, for you and I, to reciprocate in this love.
[time=1556] We've talked about the greatest commandment of all that Jesus talked about in Matthew 22
[time=1562] that you would and I would love the Lord our God, completely and fully, undivided.
[time=1568] And in Jeremiah 2, the tragedy of that passage was that we learned that what God offers us,
[time=1575] offers us, what he is providing us, what he wants to give you and I freely in this love relationship with him
[time=1583] is this water that is so pure and so right and so good and so clean and so always.
[time=1591] In Jeremiah 2, it talks about that spring of living water and how in that relationship with him,
[time=1598] if we would just be content with him, if we would just love only him, if we would just give ourselves to him,
[time=1606] he says he wants to fill us up with this water that truly quenches the deepest thirst in the human soul.
[time=1614] The deepest thirst in the human soul, he offers us this life-giving water and there you see it right there in that picture.
[time=1624] It's an amazing thing though, having been offered that, we saw in Jeremiah 2 that so many times we so thirsty, you know, you and I,
[time=1635] so in need of that which would quench, we saw the story over the last two weeks of how they would in that day
[time=1642] and we still figuratively in our day, we go dig wells, they called them cisterns, holes in the rocks,
[time=1648] holes in the ground that would catch runoff, water and make people sick and kill the animals because it was polluted and bad,
[time=1656] it was just a bad deal, but there we go, digging hole after hole, after hole, trying to find life and satisfaction,
[time=1664] that which will quench apart from the water only to be found in him.
[time=1671] He loves us, he loves us deeply and his desire as that you and I would love him reciprocally and in return.
[time=1680] And I want to read you Matthew 22, if I can, would you, Matthew 22 verses 3, we've talked about the great commandment.
[time=1688] I want to show you the two great commandments, Matthew 22, 34, would you stand just for a moment in honor of God's word and let me read this to you if I can.
[time=1698] Matthew 22 verses 34 to 40, the two great commandments, but when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees,
[time=1708] be reminded just briefly, the Sadducees and the Pharisees, the leaders of the religious order of that day now were by this time in Matthew 22,
[time=1717] it's like an all-out war, they're completely in contrast and in contradiction to what the Lord continues to speak.
[time=1724] He continues to reveal the gap and the distance between what they were teaching and what the heart and spirit of God really was.
[time=1733] And so in previous verses, he has silenced the Sadducees, now the Pharisees, they want to take a crack at it.
[time=1739] And so it says, having heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves, the Pharisees together.
[time=1746] One of them, a lawyer, asked him, Jesus, a question testing him, teacher, which is the great commandment in the law.
[time=1757] It's trying to test him, this Pharisee knows that there are hundreds, I mean, and now the Pharisees and Sadducees have extrapolated literally hundreds of laws, man-made laws.
[time=1768] There weren't that many at the beginning, but now as time has gone by, they've added two, they've added here, they've added there,
[time=1775] they've made this complicated legalistic system of do's and don'ts and Jesus is furious at the whole thing.
[time=1782] And so they're trying to kind of nail him here and they say, which is the great commandment in the law.
[time=1788] And he says, all right, we'll go down this road, verse 37, and he said to them, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."
[time=1802] There it is, undivided love, not going to the left, not going to the right, no compromise, no settling for dirty water, no.
[time=1811] "You shall love him with all your heart, soul and mind." This is the great and foremost commandment, the second, but he doesn't stop there, watch my friends.
[time=1820] These last two weeks of discussion have to, they must lead us to today's discussion, because in this passage, the two are inseparable.
[time=1831] The second is like it, the second greatest commandment, I want you to see that phrase, is like it.
[time=1840] Please understand that while yes, he does go, he does go one and two, okay, we'll give him that.
[time=1848] While he does go one and two, please understand that the way this is written grammatically if you studied this in the original language.
[time=1855] It's not one and it's not like one and like two's like way down here, all right?
[time=1861] It's not a distant second, it's almost like one a and one what?
[time=1866] Yeah, the second is say it, like it, very much like it, very connected to it, very much a part of it, and what is it?
[time=1880] You shall love your what, say it out loud, you shall love your neighbor as yourself on these, boy this is huge right here,
[time=1890] on these two commandments depend the what, say it, the whole law, the whole law and the prophets.
[time=1901] I've said it to you before my friends, but please don't miss it today, everything in here, everything,
[time=1909] everything in this book, everything that God has done in putting this together and preserving this and giving this to us,
[time=1919] all the truth, all the wisdom, all the knowledge, all the stories, he says all of it is held together in two principles.
[time=1931] You want to understand this, you want to live this, he says, love me, undivided heart, all of you, drink this water, say no to the polluted water,
[time=1942] and love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1947] Father God, we pray that you would, like only you can, God would you make this truth so very real, so very personal,
[time=1958] so very penetrating in our hearts and lives today, God, young people and old people and middle of the road folks and people that know you
[time=1968] and those that are still trying to figure this thing out, God, I pray that you would, like only you can,
[time=1974] that you would make this truth come to life, that it would live and that we could see it and grow because of it in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1984] You can be seated.
[time=1988] Gosh, actually you know what, I just lied to you, I want you to stand up again, sorry, drop your Bibles, drop your Bibles.
[time=1997] Everybody stand up, I want to just illustrate this for you, and then we're going to jump in, illustration I've seen a couple of times,
[time=2003] every time I've seen it, though not very complicated, it has always been for me an incredibly accurate picture of the work in me
[time=2012] that still needs to be done on this front of you and I, on this front of me, I'll speak for myself loving God and really loving others.
[time=2022] Okay, here's how I want to do this, here's how I've seen it, and this is going to require a little bit of physical effort on your part,
[time=2029] I'll try and be sensitive to those of you who aren't in as stellar as condition as I myself, amen.
[time=2035] I'm just kidding, we'll take breaks along the way, but watch this, here's how we start.
[time=2043] If what we've got is somebody, whoever it is, we've got somebody who doesn't know anything about God, they are far from God,
[time=2052] they don't have a relationship with God, they don't walk with the Lord, they don't understand anything about the Scriptures,
[time=2058] we just got somebody out here who's just far from God and God in his incredible mercy and grace does what only God can do,
[time=2066] you've seen it, I've seen it, we've experienced it, you and I, if we know the Lord, God brings people to himself, amen.
[time=2074] God brings this person and this person comes into a life-changing, saving, redeeming relationship with him, and this is so cool.
[time=2083] At that point, really, if you think about it, the only thing that individual knows about God, everybody puts your hands above your head and keep your hands really close together.
[time=2096] Okay, this is the scope of what this person, the only thing that person at that time knows about God is God's forgiveness.
[time=2106] Make sense? You guys are whimping out, get your hands up, up.
[time=2110] There you go, you're tired, aren't you? Yeah, hands are starting to shake, okay, rest, go ahead, you're gonna rest.
[time=2116] Okay, back up, here we go.
[time=2118] So that's the only thing, day one, you've just come to faith, what do you know about God? He forgave me.
[time=2126] Well, then a couple weeks go by, and a couple months go by, and look, go ahead, spread it out just a little bit, all of a sudden now,
[time=2132] at a couple weeks, in a couple months, I start to realize about his peace, and I start to realize about the Scriptures, and I begin to realize how my faith affects the everyday of my life,
[time=2142] and I see God more fully for who he is, his attributes, and his character go ahead a little bit wider than two, three, four, five years go by him.
[time=2150] 10, 15 years go by, and you see God saving people, and you see God moving miraculous ways, and you see the justice, and you see his compassion, and 20, 30 years go by.
[time=2161] Go ahead, spread him out, and you're just looking at God going, everybody say, wow, wow, you're in awe, okay, rest.
[time=2170] Okay, you with me, is this making sense, this vertical thing with God, everybody out again, you're just, you love God.
[time=2179] You're just 20, 30 years down the road, even two, three months down the road, it just gets expanded, and you're just laid out before I'm going, well, you are amazing, I love you.
[time=2190] Now, hands down. Why? That's vertical. Why? Horizontally. If I've got you in my scope, or you've got me, go ahead, put your hands up right here.
[time=2212] Now, we're not talking about your love for who? God. Now, we're talking about your love for who? For me.
[time=2220] Now, we're talking about my love for you. Go ahead and point at the person next to you, put that for you. Now, you're talking about them.
[time=2227] Back again, look back at me. Don't hit him. Okay, rest your arms. One more time. Okay, right there. Why, my friends, after 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years, are so many of us.
[time=2248] Maybe there. When it comes, not to loving him, but to loving who others. Have a seat.
[time=2260] God's Word says the second greatest command, the one so inextricably tied to the first greatest command. He says it is like it.
[time=2270] He says your love for God will be evidenced in your love for others. He says there in verse 30 and 38, this is the great and foremost commandment.
[time=2280] Verse 39, the second is like it, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. Now, contrary to what some have speculated, my friends, this is not, let me repeat.
[time=2290] This is not a biblical admonition to self-love. Loving your neighbor as yourself. This is not about you loving.
[time=2300] This is not some backdoor admonition to you being a person who loves yourself. I'll hear people say, I've got to learn to love myself.
[time=2311] I've got to learn to love me. I've got to learn to love me before I can love. No, you don't. Nowhere in here.
[time=2319] Does he ever say that you and I are to be consumed with and given to this deep love for ourselves?
[time=2327] And that is not what this passage is teaching. I mean, you can just look at the grammatical structure, if you will, of the sentence.
[time=2335] It says there, the second is like it, you shall love your neighbor. Grammatically, we see the object of our love is clearly to be another.
[time=2347] Someone else, our neighbor. And we are to love our neighbor as ourselves. This qualifies, this describes the nature and the kind of love we are to give.
[time=2360] The kind of love we give to our neighbor is the kind of love. Literally, write this down. Literally translated, it would read, in the same way we ourselves long to be loved.
[time=2373] That's how we are to love our neighbor in the same way that we ourselves long to be loved.
[time=2381] You are made in the image of God. I've been made in the image of God. You and I, by virtue of God's design, understand and know this desire we have to be loved.
[time=2391] There isn't a person in the room who doesn't desire to be heard, who doesn't desire to be included, who doesn't desire to be embraced, who doesn't desire to be cared for.
[time=2403] Everybody, because we were made in his image, we long to be loved. And this passage tells you and I, this passage commands you and I to be lovers of others in the same way that we ourselves long to be loved.
[time=2420] We'll come back to the loving others, the way you long to be loved, but quickly I want to ask you this, who's your neighbor? Not who's your daddy. Who's your neighbor?
[time=2433] And I'm asking you that. Who is your neighbor, this individual that you are to love, the way you, the way you long to be loved, who is it?
[time=2446] I've literally had individuals come to me in the past when teaching on this principle from Matthew 22 and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, I cannot do that.
[time=2456] You have no idea who lives next door to me. And they're thinking, you know, understandably, so they're thinking neighbor, but see oftentimes they just think neighbor, and I don't want you this morning to just think neighbor.
[time=2469] I want you to understand this word and its implications. I think a little bit more broadly.
[time=2476] Please the own. P-L-E-S-I-O-N. Please the own is the Greek word and the word neighbor and the Greek please the own.
[time=2484] It means anyone near close by or in proximity. Anyone near close by or in proximity. Not necessarily near close by or in proximity to your house, though not excluding that, but in proximity to you.
[time=2500] Anybody near close by or in proximity to me, anybody near or close by or in proximity to all of us, anybody near close by or in proximity to the church, anybody, anybody.
[time=2516] You with me? Anybody near? Anybody close by? Anybody in proximity to anybody that knows the Lord is a neighbor. Please the own, the gal and the cubicle at work.
[time=2530] She's in proximity to you, the homeless man asking for money in proximity to you, the friends, the enemies, the kind ones in your life, the difficult people in your world, the young people, the older folks, the red, yellow, black, brown and white people, the saints and the sinners.
[time=2551] And Jesus had so much to say. You see the Pharisees and the Sadducees had kind of tried to take the heart of God. It's what legalists do.
[time=2560] They try and take the heart of God and put it in a box and they try and wrap it all up and put rules and regulations and say, "This is what it looks like."
[time=2568] Well, Jesus comes and he shatters this. Look at Matthew 5. Matthew 5, 43, he says, "All right, I need to help you people understand the heart of God."
[time=2580] "I need you to understand this admonition to love." So he jumps in. Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5, 43, "You have heard that it was said," back in Leviticus is where this first came out.
[time=2592] "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your," what? Say it out loud. Neighbor.
[time=2598] And now the Pharisees had brought to the table in recent discussions in this day. They had brought this idea of they were the ones who had modeled and brought this idea of hating your enemy.
[time=2609] "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'" But I say to you, "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you." Stop right there. Real quick. Who's your enemy?
[time=2624] I want you to think about it. I want you this morning. This is an absolute waste of time. If all we do is just talk about principles and theories and read great truth but do nothing with it.
[time=2636] Who's an enemy? Who's somebody who's against you? Who's somebody who's mean to you? Who's somebody you feel threatened by? Who's somebody that's done the unspeakable to you?
[time=2647] Who's somebody in your world? You know they're there and they don't think kindly of you. They're insensitive toward you. It's funny. Not funny. It's just a reality check. Here I am.
[time=2658] I'm thinking about my mom today in Kabul. I'm thinking about believers today whose lives are at stake in Afghanistan and Iraq and Iran and I'm asking you and I who our enemies are.
[time=2671] And I'm not diminishing the fact that you and I have them. We all have one. It's called Satan, right? But it's just kind of a reality check.
[time=2681] But nonetheless, it's your reality in mind. So I'm going to ask you, who's your enemy? Who's the person who's not very thoughtful? Who's the person who you just down deep in your heart?
[time=2694] You just know that there's probably something they've got against you. You're not sure what it is. Maybe it's somebody a little distant. Maybe it's somebody very close to you and it's just not going well.
[time=2705] I need you to have a face in mind this morning. I need you to have a name or two as we talk this through.
[time=2713] Here's why, my friends, this is where it gets really dicey. This is where it gets pretty exciting, really. This is where it really, really begins to take shape.
[time=2722] He says, I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. Here you go. So that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven.
[time=2737] For he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[time=2748] So that you may be sons of your father. My friends, here's what's so severe. Here's what's so amazing about that statement that we just read.
[time=2756] What's so clearly implied there is that if you don't love that person, what's so clearly implied there is that if you and I
[time=2768] as people who profess to know and serve and follow Christ, if we are sons of God, if we're sons and daughters of the Lord,
[time=2779] he says clearly, we will be people who love our enemies. We will be people who pray for those who persecute us.
[time=2788] So amazing, as you read and study the New Testament, one of the most significant usages of that word, please the own.
[time=2797] This idea of neighbor and the living out of this loving of the please the own, the neighbor. One of the most significant usages of it in the New Testament is Luke 10.
[time=2806] Do you remember what happened in Luke 10? It's the story of the good. What? Say it louder. The good Samaritan.
[time=2815] The good Samaritan who, and just write that down, write down Luke 10. Read that tonight. Use that with your, share that with your kids tonight.
[time=2823] Talk about it in your group next time you meet Luke 10, the good Samaritan. And I want you to read through that story all over again
[time=2830] because my friends, the story of the good Samaritan, just to remind you, it is so much more than a guy who just stopped and put a cold rag on a forehead.
[time=2839] I mean, this guy went the extra mile. He went the extra five. This guy with somebody who he shouldn't have cared for, somebody who religiously and ethnically and socially was the absolute antithesis.
[time=2853] They were absolute enemies. They were rivals. He would have in that day gone past that guy as fast as you could blink.
[time=2862] But we see in the Scriptures this guy being painted as the neighbor. And we see this kind of love being portrayed that you and I are to evidence if we are sons of God.
[time=2879] Well, question for you. Who, who aren't you going to love? So who, tell me now, who aren't you going to sacrifice for? Who aren't you going to give to?
[time=2895] Tell me, who am I not going to serve? Who are we not going to encourage? Who are we not going to provide for as we come alongside to try and extend our hearts in God's hand?
[time=2906] Who are we not going to extend kindness to? Who are you not going to love? The Scripture, my friends, makes room for absolutely nobody.
[time=2919] Everybody, everybody should be in our scope. And there should be in you and me this willingness and readiness to extend a level and kind of love that would allow us to extend ourselves just as we were extended to him because we loved him.
[time=2942] And now it's time for you to love me and now it's time for me to love you and now it's time for you to love him.
[time=2950] With arms wide open, how serious an issue is this for us today? How seriously do we need to consider this great truth personally and in the life of this church, in the life of this ministry God's given us?
[time=2965] I think it's huge. Oftentimes I hesitate to say these words. Oftentimes those who lead Bible studies, oftentimes pastors who stand behind pulp, oftentimes there is kind of a hesitation to say these words and the words are open your Bibles to 1 John.
[time=2986] And the reason I say that kind of tongue in cheek is that I don't know how much time you've spent in 1 John, but my friends, it is really, really a powerful book that speaks truth in an incredibly powerful way.
[time=3001] And the way John does it, he doesn't mince words, he shoots absolutely straight, he takes the great truth of God and represents, I believe God represents through John his heart in such a way that there is no mistaking what he's trying to say.
[time=3018] It is oftentimes extremely confrontational, it is oftentimes even extremely confusing, it is so direct.
[time=3027] And so sometimes because of its confrontational and direct nature, oftentimes people shy away from 1 John.
[time=3036] But I don't think we should shy away from it. I think we should just take a minute, we're going to come back to it in the days to come, but look with me at 1 John chapter 3.
[time=3044] I know you through the very words of God, through the pen of John as he writes this letter, what he has to say about this issue of you and I, loving others.
[time=3054] 1 John 3, we're going to pick it up in verse 6, and right out of the gate, all of a sudden you get a feel for how this thing goes.
[time=3062] No one who abides in him sins. How are we doing? No one who abides in him sins.
[time=3079] All right, let me try and help you. What we're saying here is this, this book throughout its pages is talking about the posture of your heart.
[time=3090] This book throughout its pages is talking about the pattern of your life, we're talking about the propensity, we're talking about your character, we're talking about how you would be described.
[time=3101] And if I were describing you or you were describing me, I hope you wouldn't describe me based upon one instance, right?
[time=3109] We're talking about the posture of our heart, the leaning of our soul. What are we postured toward? What are we characterized by?
[time=3118] What's really going on in us? Is what's really going on in us that we could care less about sin?
[time=3128] We just do it, and we could care less about it, and we don't really care about what's right or wrong, and we just sin, sin, sin, sin, sin.
[time=3138] And that's just who we are, and it's just what we do.
[time=3142] That person, John says, does not have the love of God.
[time=3147] That person does not abide in him, because if you abide in him, while there will be sin, there will be a heart, and there will be a posture of one's heart that doesn't want to.
[time=3163] That when there's sin, there's confession. That when there's sin, there's repentance. And though the road sometimes kind of looks like this, because I abide in him, I am not committed to my sin hard, heartedly and shamelessly.
[time=3177] That person, he says, does not abide in him. No one who abides in him sins. No one who sins has seen him or knows him.
[time=3186] Little children, make sure no one deceives you. The one who practices, there's that word, the one who practices righteousness is righteous, characterized by, just as he is righteous.
[time=3199] The one who practices is characterized by hard-hearted and growing patterns of sin. The one who practices sin is of the devil.
[time=3209] Ooh, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The son of God appeared for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil.
[time=3217] No one who is born of God practices sin because his seed, God's seed abides in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God.
[time=3229] Here we go. Watch where this goes. By this, the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious. Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God.
[time=3242] And does your Bible have right there a period? Yes or no? No. He chooses to just throw one more line in here to really bring this truth to fruition.
[time=3254] Here's what I mean. Nor the one who does not read it out loud. Love his brother.
[time=3262] The degree to which you love your neighbor. The degree to which you're willing to give yourself away. The degree to which you and I are willing to go from here to here.
[time=3274] God's word says in 1 John clarifies who's a son of God and who's a son of hell.
[time=3283] And I, like all week long I'm trying to think of a different way to say that to you.
[time=3289] But there's no other way to say it to you because that's what it says.
[time=3294] And it's about the pattern of your life. It's about the condition of your heart.
[time=3300] Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God nor the one who does not love his brother.
[time=3308] So I just want to ask you, we'll come back to it. Here's the water.
[time=3312] So pure, so right, so true, quenching the deepest thirst in the human soul when you love him, when you're in a relationship.
[time=3320] If this, oh, I love you, if that's genuine, if that's real, if that has truly penetrated your heart and soul and mind, then guess what we become.
[time=3332] Guess what we become? Then we become water, boys.
[time=3337] Then we become people who walk around in life with arms that are expanding ever so wide and we're ready to give whatever we can.
[time=3347] Whatever the need might be, whoever you might be. Here, you know what you need, you need him.
[time=3352] You need his love. You need something that will quench that thirst. Let me do that for you.
[time=3357] Let me give that to you. Let me love you. The second is like the first, loving God and loving others.
[time=3367] You and I at work, you and I at home, you and I in the neighborhood, having taken of the pure stuff,
[time=3375] having received what it means to have thirst, real thirst quenched, we then become people who pass it on.
[time=3382] We then become people who are willing to be water boys and girls in the marketplace in the neighborhood willing to love our neighbor as ourselves, the way you and I would long to be loved.
[time=3399] Father, God, thank you for the time this morning. Thank you so very much for your great truth.
[time=3406] God, as we close, I would just want you to in the way that only you can. God, I pray that you would bring the name and the face of that enemy to every person's mind here in this room today.
[time=3421] Whoever that person is, that person that would it would be so difficult for those sitting in this room, you know, for us to go and love, for us to go and give water to, for us to go and open ourselves up.
[time=3436] Whoever that person is, God, that that would be so hard for us to do. God, I pray that you would keep that face and that name in our hearts and minds right now, and that we would be people willing.
[time=3449] Because of our genuine love for you, that we would be people willing to pass that love along, loving priests, helping others see and experience what you are like.
[time=3462] God, thank you so much for our time of worship this morning. Thank you for the choir and the musicians, they work so hard this week to bring an extra offering to us.
[time=3472] God, we pray that they would be encouraged, and God bring us back together soon, if that be your will. In your son's precious name we pray, and all the people agreed and said, amen.
