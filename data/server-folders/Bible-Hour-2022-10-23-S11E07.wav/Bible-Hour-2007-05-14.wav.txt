[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=44] end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=58] Let the cross hide by my knee, Pay your blood, what shed for me, There's no greater love
[time=73] than it, You have overcome the grave, Your glory fills the highest state, what can separate
[time=88] me now." Helping cross by my knee, Pay your blood, what shed for me, There's no greater love than
[time=103] me, You have overcome the grave, Your glory fills the highest state, what can separate
[time=117] me now, He's on a bell, You made a way, When You said that it is done, You told that
[time=135] it is done, You made a way, When You said that it is done."
[time=152] Then I looked again, and I heard the singing of thousands and millions of angels around
[time=160] the throne and the living beings and the elders, and they sang in a mighty chorus, "The lamb
[time=169] is worthy, the lamb who was killed, He is worthy to receive power and riches and wisdom
[time=180] and strength and honor and glory and blessing, and then I heard every creature in heaven,
[time=190] and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and they also sang, blessing and honor
[time=200] and glory and power belong to the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb forever and
[time=210] ever.
[time=224] Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy to be praised, forever and a day, Your worthy
[time=240] Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy
[time=260] to be praised, forever and a day, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy to be praised,
[time=277] forever and a day, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy to be praised, forever
[time=315] Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy
[time=355] to be praised, forever and a day, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your
[time=375] worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your worthy, Your
[time=850] the most powerful visionaries I've ever read. I'll tell you what, when he first got a hold
[time=857] of that ragtag group of twelve, and he said to them, "Hey guys, all of whom had been for
[time=864] years making a living doing what? They were fishermen." He said to them, "I want to make
[time=870] you fishers of what?" Wow. Right there, this clear and compelling picture of vision, an
[time=882] endeavor that those guys gave their lives to, a picture that you and I still to this day, when we hear that phrase, "Fishers of men," it carries with it all the redemptive power
[time=894] and value that we could ever imagine. When we think about being a part of this great endeavor, we're got to allow us to see people come to faith in Christ. Well, I want to share
[time=904] with you this morning some vision, if I can, for us as a family. Every once in a while,
[time=911] I think it's a really good idea for you and I to just stop, and to remember what it is
[time=917] that God has called us to. This is a very important couple of Sundays here. We've spent
[time=923] the last two talking about something extremely important. This idea of you and I being lovers
[time=929] of God and lovers of people, and that was done with real purpose and real intent. That
[time=935] just feeds right into these next couple of Sundays where I want to just ask you if you're
[time=942] a part of this family, if this ministry means something to you, if Black Hawk is a place that you call home, and if these are people that you call friends, then we need to over these next couple of Sundays. Just take a moment, kind of pause if you will for a bit, and be reminded, and also not only be reminded, but allow me the privilege of sharing with
[time=962] you some things that as leaders we've come to in recent days, that it's very, very important you hear from me.
[time=970] Vision. We talk often around here about our mission, the reason we exist to help seekers
[time=977] find and follow Christ. Have you heard that in a while? It's why we do what we do. It's a very biblical concept. We exist, we believe, here at Black Hawk to help people, to encourage
[time=988] people, to come alongside folks. There is no greater thrill, and I mean it. There is no greater thrill than to come alongside people, people who are searching, people who are asking
[time=999] questions, people who are grappling and wrestling with the issues of life, and we're trying our best to be a people who help seekers find faith, find hope in life in Christ, find forgiveness
[time=1012] in Him. We're trying to help seekers find and then know and begin to understand at very
[time=1018] meaningful levels what it means to follow Christ. Helping seekers find and then know
[time=1024] what it means to follow Christ. Now, this is just something I've seen. I've seen it
[time=1030] a hundred times. You've probably seen it many times as well. I want to just kind of draw this picture for you if I can. Oftentimes, in any endeavor, in any organization, especially,
[time=1042] I've seen it to be true in the church. Oftentimes, whenever a faithful band of Christ followers
[time=1049] begins their journey down this road of ministry and life together, imagine, if you will, a
[time=1055] church plant, a brand new church and a brand new setting with an enormous opportunity
[time=1061] to possibly impact and reach a culture, a community. Oftentimes, when Christ followers
[time=1069] engage in that kind of endeavor and they rally together and they kind of put their hands
[time=1075] in the circle at, oftentimes, in those situations, the value of mission, if you will. I'm going
[time=1083] to just write mission right here. Oftentimes, and if this is a chart, this is a graph, oftentimes
[time=1090] in those settings, the value of mission is sky high. And what I mean by that is oftentimes
[time=1097] when we begin, we're all kind of looking each other in the eye and we're saying, "You know what? We're going to give ourselves completely to this. We are so grateful to God for what He did in us, so hungry in our hearts to pass this along to others, so wanting to see people
[time=1113] reconciled to faith, so given to do whatever we might need to do. We'll give however much
[time=1119] money we may need to put up front. We'll give however many hours you might need from us.
[time=1123] We will do anything to serve and love and encourage. We're all in this together. We're
[time=1130] all going to give it our best. Oftentimes, in those situations, the value of mission is incredibly high. And oftentimes, in those situations, the value of survival is low.
[time=1149] We don't think much about survival in these situations. No, I'm not going to waste our time thinking about survival or keeping people happy or doing things the way folks expect
[time=1160] us to do. No, because we want to change the world. We want to do our very best to give
[time=1166] ourselves completely. So oftentimes, in these situations, mission is off the charge. Survival
[time=1173] barely showing up. And then something happens. And you've seen it and I've seen it. And what
[time=1182] happens is this, off we go into the wild blue ministry yonder, having a great, great time
[time=1189] and a couple, two, three, four, five years go by. And all of a sudden, you get tired.
[time=1198] All of a sudden, we get a little discouraged. All of a sudden, it's not quite as exciting
[time=1206] as it was in those early days. All of a sudden, start making a little bit more money. All
[time=1214] of a sudden, everybody gets a few more toys. All of a sudden, in some situations, people
[time=1220] get distracted. And what was a burning, hot vision at one point, kind of slowly fates.
[time=1229] And now, what happens is we're just kind of showing up on something, doing a good thing.
[time=1238] Given an effort to a really good cause, but now all of a sudden, as mission, as the value of mission begins to decrease, all of a sudden, there begins to be some challenges. There
[time=1249] begins to be some trouble. Now, all of a sudden, we start trying to keep people what? Happy.
[time=1262] Now all of a sudden, it's just what we do Sunday at 1045 or 1105 for some. You know
[time=1270] what I mean? Now, I got to be honest with you. I'm going to shoot straight with you. I'm going to a little bit of confession here, just on my part. These are things I have to
[time=1281] wrestle with. Here are things I struggle with and others in leadership and anybody in the room who leads in any setting would understand this, I think. When you sense this beginning
[time=1292] to wane and you sense this value beginning to spike, then all of a sudden, you feel enormous
[time=1298] pressure because you really want this to work. But then all of a sudden, you really do start worrying about what people are thinking. You start to feel a personal sense of responsibility.
[time=1309] And oftentimes, even good people with good hearts who want to do a good thing begin to
[time=1315] be held captive by this value instead of giving themselves wholeheartedly to this. And anytime,
[time=1324] we get from this point on, that, my friends, is the beginning of death. That is the beginning
[time=1332] of an organization, a church losing its vision, its power, its ability to function in the
[time=1339] way that God designed it, to function because God designed us to function with his mission.
[time=1345] Now I want to tell you this. I draw that picture for you, not because I sense or feel or we as a leadership sense or feel that that's us. I don't necessarily feel like that's us.
[time=1355] What I'm saying is there are times I get concerned about this. And this you can look at as us,
[time=1362] really what this is, is you. Is it you? Is it me? And we don't want that to be the case.
[time=1368] And so I just want you to know that in the last year, really, it's been just about a
[time=1374] year now. We, in a sense, kind of behind closed doors and kind of just a private, not very public way, we as elders, those who give leadership and oversight to Black Hawk Ministries, we
[time=1386] have been meeting and we have been praying and we have been searching the Scriptures and we have been on our knees trying our very best to understand and be able to determine
[time=1397] and decipher how God would want us to move forward in the days to come. What is it that He would want us to value? What kind of vision would He want us to cast? How is it that He
[time=1408] would want us to be responsible with this amazing ministry that God has given us? And so we have prayed and we have searched the Scriptures. We've looked at that mission statement. We feel God gave us years ago helping seekers find and follow Christ. And you know what? As we looked at that statement and as we considered that truth, here's where our hearts and minds went. If the end game on this is to try and see people who having found Him would begin to know, really know, people like you, people like me, people who
[time=1439] would really know what it means and looks like to follow Christ. If Christ followers
[time=1448] is really what this is about, trying to encourage and teach and move people in that direction with God's help, well then we felt like, you know what? We have got to revisit what a Christ-following 10th grader looks like. What does a Christ-following mother of two
[time=1463] look like? What does a Christ-following senior adult look like? What does that look like?
[time=1468] What does it mean to follow Christ? Not on Sunday mornings at 1045, though that's important,
[time=1475] but in the everyday and all of life. So as an elder team, we kind of challenged ourselves
[time=1483] to spend about a month or so. We spent a little over a month reading. Each and every day we kind of just made our way through just red and red and red and took notes and took notes, shared our learnings. We went back through the Gospels. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and the book of Acts. We threw that in there, very important book. We read and we read and we took in and we wrestled with and shared our learnings as we looked at the Gospels
[time=1509] again asking the questions. So what did followers of Christ really look like? What kinds of things
[time=1517] did they value? How was it that they gave themselves to the everyday of their lives and their existence? What does a follower of Christ really do? How do they think? What
[time=1528] do they look like? And we prayed, oh God, as we looked at that, we prayed, God, reveal in us and reveal in this place, areas of weakness, areas of atrophy, where maybe we once were
[time=1542] strong but now we've become weak, areas where we need to give attention and we need to be giving a renewed effort. God allow us to refocus wherever we might need to refocus. God, we prayed God reveal any sin in us. Any weakness that we might have as leaders, weaknesses
[time=1560] or sins that might be perpetuating us from optimal effectiveness for the king. And as
[time=1569] we prayed and as we read and as we discussed this, we came to some conclusions and we were
[time=1577] really, really thankful for what we learned. Let me show you briefly what we were reminded of. We came down to this picture as we read through the Gospels and Acts of a disciple,
[time=1589] a following genuine follower of Jesus Christ. And as we read about disciples, we realized
[time=1596] all over again that Christ's disciples were, look at the screen, we're going to just kind of go through this quickly, they were learners. Now granted, sometimes it took them a while to learn but they learned they were men who traveled with, spent time with, came alongside
[time=1611] the master and they in time they learned, they opened up their hearts and lives to what he had for them and they at the end of the day learned a great deal about him and what
[time=1622] he had called them to. Christ's disciples followed faithfully. Again, there were times where there were bumps. There was a hiccup now and then but at the end of the day, these guys followed their Lord. At the end of the day, these guys gave themselves completely.
[time=1638] They were learners. They followed faithfully. They left everything to advance the kingdom.
[time=1644] When you hear about them dropping their nets, these fisher men that they were, they really
[time=1650] did. They left everything. The value of following him, the desire to learn, this invitation
[time=1660] to take part in the kingdom of God, it was so compelling to them, they left everything.
[time=1668] There was great sacrifice in their makeup. They learned, they were faithful followers.
[time=1674] They left everything to advance the kingdom. They paid a price. They paid a price in the everyday of life, my friends, but they also, as many of you know in the room, they eventually all of them paid the price of their lives, literally giving their lives for the sake
[time=1689] of the gospel. There was great commitment in them. There was great devotion in them.
[time=1696] They paid a price. They modeled Christ's heart to the broken. Next one, they sacrificed
[time=1702] to see lost people redeemed. They struggled with that one at times. But again, in the end, they realized what it meant. They realized what an enormous thrill and privilege it was to see and to be a part of seeing people come to faith and they gave themselves to that.
[time=1717] There's one that's not up there. I want to just tell you this. They also loved each other, my friends, deeply. These disciples, these followers of Christ, they were radical in their commitment to share themselves with each other, a love that knew no bounds, a
[time=1732] commitment to each other's needs that was just incredible. And so as we looked at all this, as we were reminded of what a disciple looked like, then our thoughts and our attention
[time=1744] came to you. And this is not a scorecard. This is not a, this is not a grade that you're
[time=1752] being given. All right? Really, if anything, this was an effort on our part to look at you, this family and to say, okay, if this, if this is that important, and if our desire
[time=1763] is to be a place that never, ever falls into this mode of survival, if what we really want to be about is a band of Christ's followers that faithfully gives themselves. No matter
[time=1774] what, to that which God has called them to, then what are some things that we see today?
[time=1779] We just got really honest with ourselves. You know how hard it is? I think most of you in the room know how hard it is to be criticized. I don't like it. It's very difficult to have
[time=1791] people write nasty notes or emails telling me what a lousy job I'm doing or how wrong
[time=1797] I am about this or that. Sometimes the words hurt, sometimes more than the words, it's the spirit with which it's said, but there is something really healthy about hearing the
[time=1808] truth, admitting the truth, and doing that in the context of those who are speaking that
[time=1814] to you in love, where you trust them and their motives. And so we just sat around a table,
[time=1821] a night or two, and we spoke the truth to each other in love about this ministry. And
[time=1827] there are some concerns that surfaced. And really, these concerns, I think, rest with
[time=1834] us in terms of the kind of ministry that we need to be and want to be offering. Let me
[time=1840] show you some things that we came up with. We looked at our family today and we realized that while both of these categories exist, there really is a difference between the two and we would love to see people making the move toward the right of the screen. And you
[time=1855] will understand that in just a moment. You know, there's a difference. I'll just start out here. There's a difference, my friends, between a grateful attender and a deeply engaged participant. Now, here's the deal. We sat in the room that night. We said, you know what? There's a lot of people at Black Hawk. There are a lot of people that call
[time=1874] this place home. And while we are so very, hear me now, so very grateful for everybody
[time=1880] who walks through those doors. I know that there are some of you who walk through those doors. You sit in your seat, most of you, the same seat week after week after week.
[time=1895] And there's a lot of you who come in and do that and you're really grateful. And I want you to know that's good. You sit and you listen and you take in. I believe that you're encouraged by what you hear. I think in those, in that hour or hour and 15 minutes, I think maybe your, you know, your heart is lifted and you're reminded of good things and you're genuinely grateful and then you get up, we sing a song and you go home. And you engage again in all
[time=1922] of that seven days later at 1045 in the same seat and that's your routine. And while we're
[time=1931] thankful for grateful attenders, what God has called us to is to invite you to be a deeply
[time=1939] engaged, engaged participant who takes everything that you've heard, who takes the teaching of
[time=1946] God's Word, the movement of the Spirit in times of worship, the conviction He brings to your heart and never disengages but takes that and lives in that and lives that out
[time=1958] seven days a week. Somebody who is growing in your faith and not simply just being fed
[time=1964] on Sunday mornings but by God's grace and with His help, you're self feeding yourself
[time=1971] through the week. You're spending time in this and we're doing a good job of helping you and encouraging you to do that. And that right side, it's a good side to be on. That's
[time=1983] the picture that we believe God is after. Grateful attender or deeply engaged participant. There's
[time=1990] a difference between thankful listeners and passionate priests. Same idea. It's one thing
[time=1996] to be here. It's one thing to enjoy being here and be thankful for what goes on here.
[time=2002] It's another thing to, as we've talked about over the last several months, to be a priest.
[time=2007] To be somebody who in relationship with Christ realizes that the redeeming power of God,
[time=2013] the life change that you experienced, the compassion of God and the mercy of God and the love of God and the justice of God, you get to pass that along to others. And it doesn't end
[time=2026] at 12, 15 on Sunday. It's a seven day a week in the cubicle at work, in the neighborhood
[time=2032] during the evenings, wherever you go, whoever you're with, you are passionate about this privilege of being a priest. It doesn't leave your mind. You're reading about it. You're
[time=2043] praying about it. You're talking to others about it. There's a difference between being a thankful listener for an hour and 15 minutes as decent as that is and a passionate priest.
[time=2055] And we want to do a better job of helping many of you make that journey to the right
[time=2062] side of that screen. There's a difference between a supporter of Blackhawk, really.
[time=2068] As much as we're thankful for your support, you support us by being here, you support us with your giving, for instance. You support us in a number of ways, but more than your support, and I'll say this to you, more than your support, I want you to be somebody who follows Christ in the everyday of your life, morning, noon and night, and to the degree
[time=2092] that you're not doing that today, we want to come alongside and give leadership and
[time=2100] guidance and encouragement that will help you move in that direction. There's a difference my friends between a church shopper and a church stakeholder, church shopping, a cringe,
[time=2113] sometimes when people use the phrase, I understand, I will say this, I understand you may be new in the area, and you may be looking for a place to fellowship a body that you could be a part of, and you may want to check out a few. That makes all the sense in the world I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about those who have been around for years and still haven't found that one place that meets your every domain, I mean need. That's what bothers
[time=2141] me. Go where you're going to go. I mean, be where you're going to be, but be there.
[time=2147] Church shopping, I feel like we're talking about going out and getting a grill. I feel like we're talking about a garment, some clothes. No, no, no, it's so much more than an item that you're going to purchase and use. It's something. It's a living organism you're going
[time=2162] to give your life to, hopefully. There's a difference between even being a member and
[time=2171] being a disciple. We want you to be a stakeholder. We want you to be fully vested completely
[time=2179] and absolutely given to each other, not a place, but to the relationships God has given
[time=2185] us. This disciple phrase, this idea of a genuine follower of Christ is where we've landed.
[time=2192] We are so committed these days in our hearts to give ourselves to a kind of ministry with
[time=2199] great focus and a singular purpose be about that very endeavor, helping people become,
[time=2207] in the everyday of your life, a follower of Christ, a disciple. How can we move back more
[time=2214] and more to the right side? Look at Colossians 1. Here are some passages. I want to just share these with you. Open your Bibles to Colossians chapter 1. I want to read this verse to you. Colossians 1, 28. This would be, as we've gone through this process, this
[time=2228] would be the beginnings of our vision, our hope for what we could give ourselves to in
[time=2234] the days to come. Colossians 1, 28. We proclaim, you see it there, we proclaim everybody say
[time=2243] Him. We proclaim Him. We will. We will be a place. This will be a ministry. It will be
[time=2253] a television broadcast. It will be a gathering worship service on Sundays at 9 and 10.45.
[time=2261] It will be a common ground on Wednesdays at 6.45. It will be a Christian school. We
[time=2267] will, over and above all else, we will always proclaim who? Say it. Him. Because He, my
[time=2275] friends, is worth proclaiming. He, He is it. Are you kidding me? Go back to, I don't know
[time=2282] if you caught this, and maybe it's just me that's so overwhelmed and impacted by this.
[time=2286] But go back to Revelation 5, you guys, on the screens. Did you see what Marcia read talking
[time=2292] about Him? And you might want to remember this. The next time you're trying to figure out who you're going to be loyal to, the next time you're thinking about who you're really going to give yourself to, the next time you're really wrestling with what your life is going to be about, you might want to consider, in the end, how this all winds up as it relates
[time=2310] to, say it, Him. Look at this, at 11. Then I looked again, and this is John talking about
[time=2317] the end of it all. He says, I heard the voices of thousands and millions of, okay, keep going.
[time=2323] It was in, I think it was in 12 or 13. They sang in a mighty chorus. Here it is. Here it is. Look. And then I heard every creature in heaven, and every creature on earth, and
[time=2337] every creature under the earth, and every creature in the sea, and they sang. Okay, this isn't
[time=2346] hyperbole. Okay. He's not just, he's not just kind of painting a fuzzy picture here. No.
[time=2352] In the end, think about it. He's that big. He's that powerful. He's that mighty. He is in
[time=2359] the end everything, and the whales will sing about Him. And the sharks raise their voices,
[time=2367] and all creatures above heaven, all creature, every single living creature in the universe
[time=2376] will proclaim whose name is. So I think He's worth proclaiming to you on a weekly and regular
[time=2386] basis. And I'll just proclaim Him right here to you. Just feel led to do this. I want to
[time=2393] proclaim Him to you. Anybody in the room that doesn't know Him. Anybody in the room who,
[time=2401] for whatever reason to this point in time, you've not surrendered your heart and life to Him.
[time=2407] Anybody in the room who, to this point in time, hasn't sought forgiveness and redemption and hope
[time=2417] and promise from the only one who can give it to you. I know there are things that hold you back.
[time=2423] I know there are things that are confusing, but we're here today to lovingly invite you to surrender every part of you to who, my friends, Him. To Him, the one who can save,
[time=2435] the one who can make new. We will, Colossians 128, and we are making a renewed commitment
[time=2442] to you on this front. We will proclaim Him. Admonishing, look what it says there,
[time=2449] admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom. Stop right there. We are renewing
[time=2458] our commitment to this, and this is, this can get dicey. This part can get interesting.
[time=2466] Do you understand what it means to be admonished? You know what being admonished sometimes
[time=2472] is uncomfortable. Do you realize that being admonished? Admonished is a stern, loving correction.
[time=2479] Admonished is when I see you doing something that I know in God's design is not good.
[time=2488] It's not healthy. It's not what He's called you to do or be, and I see that in you. I observe
[time=2494] that in you, and because I love you, not because I'm better than you, and not because I think
[time=2500] God died and made me judge. These are things I hear often from people, but because I love you,
[time=2509] and because we care for each other, we admire our desires as leaders, that we would be the kind
[time=2517] of leadership that would in any and all settings wherever it might be needed, admonish you. Sometimes
[time=2524] you receive admonishment from the Word as I do my best to explain it to you. Other times we receive
[time=2531] admonishment in relationships. Here's the thing about admonishment. If you're going to admonish me, if you're going to be able to look into my life and see things that need to be addressed, if I
[time=2542] were going to be able to look into your life and see things that need to be addressed, if we're going to exercise admonishment around here, one thing I know admonishment doesn't take place from a
[time=2553] distance. Admonishment takes place when we live life together, which is why you hear me say all the
[time=2560] time as thankful as I am for this, and as important as it is for elders, pastors and teachers to equip
[time=2567] the saints for the work of service as much as the pew plays into this thing, the living room,
[time=2574] community, settings that promote intimacy, honesty and accountability, people who can walk
[time=2583] through the everyday of life with you, relationships that are that close. That's why it's so very
[time=2590] important. We will proclaim Him and we will faithfully admonish you, and that admonishment is something
[time=2598] that needs to be experienced at all levels. We will proclaim Him admonishing every man and teaching every man. Let's just not forget it. The fact of the matter is, it is so very important that you and
[time=2610] I continue to be people who are open and receptive to the teaching of God's truth, teaching that takes
[time=2618] place in the gathering, teaching that takes place in a classroom, teaching that takes place in a living room. We must be lifelong learners, and the day that you and I become so arrogant
[time=2632] that we think somehow we've learned it all and there is no more to be revealed
[time=2639] is a sad, dark day. We will continue to faithfully proclaim Him, admonish you when necessary,
[time=2648] and do our very best to teach you. This is where it gets really scary in some ways for me and for
[time=2656] those who fulfill the role that I fulfill. Look what it says, so that we may Colossians 128. We're
[time=2662] going to do all that so that we may present, this is Paul speaking to the Church at Colossae, we leaders,
[time=2669] so that we may present every man complete in Christ. This is an expectation. I think this is
[time=2680] part of a biblical position description, if you will, for those of us that's really overwhelming.
[time=2686] I'm responsible for you. I mean, there's a part of this that's on me. There's a part of this that's
[time=2694] on us. God says that we are as leaders to interact and minister to you in a way that allows you to
[time=2701] be someday presented to Him complete, not incomplete, that we would have been faithful to teach you
[time=2709] and admonish you, that we would have been faithful to proclaim only Him, that we would have done well in our efforts to lead and love. Now you play a part in that as well and I'm thankful for that.
[time=2721] I'm glad it's not all on me. He calls you to work out your salvation and fear and trembling. He calls
[time=2729] you to aggressively and actively and personally be a part of that sanctification process. Look what
[time=2736] it says in Colossians 2. Just go over a page so thankful for a good friend and a dear servant
[time=2745] who's given himself to this place for years. In one of these elder meetings, Neil Clay shared
[time=2751] with us a passage that God had brought to His heart and mind as we talked about this issue, this desire to be a place that really across the board re-engages in this effort to teach and train
[time=2763] and encourage you to be Christ followers. And Neil led us to Colossians 2 verses 6 and 7.
[time=2772] I love what it says. It says, "Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord."
[time=2778] And I don't think this is an awkward deal. Really, I don't think it is. I think you know those of you
[time=2786] who are here. You know if you've been around here at all, that if you haven't surrendered your heart
[time=2793] in life to Christ yet, you know that we're thankful that you're here. You're not the bad guy.
[time=2799] You're one that we have great respect for. So this is not what I'm about to do. It's not in any way,
[time=2806] an effort to single you out. Please don't take it as such. But I want those in the room this morning who have. If you have surrendered your heart and life to Jesus Christ, if you have basically
[time=2819] proclaimed your intent and your desire to be a Christ follower, I just want you to raise your
[time=2826] hand just quietly right where you're at. Raise your hand. Thank you. And those of you who raised
[time=2832] your hands, this is what God's word calls you to participate in. This is what God's word calls us
[time=2840] to bring to you in terms of the kind of ministry that we would offer. Therefore, as you have received
[time=2848] Christ, everybody who raised their hands, young and old, middle-aged, red, yellow, black and white, educated, uneducated, doesn't matter who you are. If you've received Christ,
[time=2859] so walk in Him, having been, say it out loud, firmly rooted. So walk in Him, having been
[time=2871] firmly rooted. Understand firmly rooted. Not just rooted. We've all been out in the garden with
[time=2878] our wives, right? Moving one plant from here to there. I'm not really sure the vat. That's always
[time=2884] been a confusing thing for me. Moving a plant from here to here. But we just do it, right?
[time=2888] We go over, we dig our hole. We take the shovel and you dig that hole and you pick up that plant,
[time=2894] you plop that baby in there and you pack it around with dirt and you throw the water on it and that thing's rooted. Now this is firmly rooted. We're talking about roots that are allowed to go deep.
[time=2909] We're talking about a foundation that is even deeper than normal, a foundation that allows you
[time=2915] to weather the storm, a spiritual grounding, a planting, a watering, a feeding that allows you
[time=2924] as a spiritual plant to flourish. This is what He calls you to. This is what He calls us to.
[time=2931] So walk in Him, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him, now being built up in Him
[time=2941] and established in your faith, just as you were instructed and overflowing with gratitude.
[time=2951] This is the kind of ministry He's called us to. Look at Ephesians 4. Galatians, Ephesians,
[time=2958] Philippians, Colossians, stop there in Ephesians and look at Ephesians 4 and 11. I love one of my favorite prayers in all of Scripture is the prayer that Paul prays. And this prayer, my friend,
[time=2970] this prayer is echoed today on the part of those who lead you. I want to invite you back next week.
[time=2979] I cannot wait to kind of unfold for you where this all has led. There are some things that I need to
[time=2987] share with you about future ministry direction and some things that we're going to immediately
[time=2993] begin to bring your way. There are some things that have kind of a long range impact and potential that I want to share with you. This study that we've been a part of as elders, these great truths
[time=3004] that God has brought us to now begin to shape the way in a new and fresh way, the way we're going to
[time=3010] give ourselves to you. I want to read this to you though as Corbin and the team, they're going to come up and close us out here. But I want to read this to you. Ephesians 4, please listen, please concentrate
[time=3021] on this. Ephesians 4, 11. It says, "And He gave some as apostles and some as prophets." Actually,
[time=3030] this isn't the prayer. That was another passage. But this is a great, great passage. Look at this.
[time=3033] He gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and
[time=3039] teachers for the equipping of the saints to see you deeply rooted, if you will, for the work of service
[time=3048] to the building up of the body of Christ until we all attain to the unity of the faith and the
[time=3056] knowledge of the Son of God until we all attain to a mature man. That was a word that came up, my friends,
[time=3063] in our discussions. Again, this is not a knock on you. This is a good thing. We wonder if we're doing
[time=3071] the kind of job that we need to do to help you be mature in your faith, seasoned as it were.
[time=3080] This is what Paul says here. God gave you the church leaders to equip you and to bill you up to the
[time=3087] stature of a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[time=3093] As a result, we are no longer, when we give ourselves to that kind of ministry, look what happens.
[time=3098] We are no longer to be children tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of
[time=3105] doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness and deceitful scheming, but speaking the truth
[time=3112] in love, we are to grow up. That's what I long for in your life. Sometimes we use it as a derogatory
[time=3121] term. Hey, grow up. No, I'm saying it with all the love and hope I can muster. We long for you,
[time=3130] parent. We long for you, grandparent. We long for you, young adult, to grow up, fully established
[time=3137] and rooted in him, to grow up in all aspects and to him who is the head, even Christ. Watch this,
[time=3145] Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies,
[time=3153] according to the proper working of each individual part, need every one of you to be engaged,
[time=3160] causing the growth of the body, for the building up of itself in love.
[time=3166] We long for you, my friends, to be changed and transformed. Many of you have been.
[time=3175] Many of you are in the midst of being so completely transformed. It brings great joy. Others of you,
[time=3182] though. Others of you in the room this morning, it is our hope that you would feel lovingly invited
[time=3188] to an existence in relationship with him and an existence here that would move you beyond listening
[time=3194] to a changed life and an engagement, a personal engagement with him and those in this room. Corbin
[time=3203] and the team are going to end us with a song here about that change. Many of you know the song, you're welcome to sing it. Please don't leave. Just allow this to kind of be for this morning a chance to thank God for this process of ministry he allows us to be a part of.
[time=3238] You've been so generous to me. How can I worship more than sing, and live our redemption's melody.
[time=3263] I have been blessed. Now I want to be a blessing. I have been loved. Now I want to bring love.
[time=3274] I've been invited. I want to share the invitation. I have been changed. You've
[time=3284] been changed. You've been changed. You've been changed. You've been changed. You've been changed. You've
[time=3309] been loved and named. In Jesus' blood we are loved. We are healed. We're forgiven and free of our shame.
[time=3322] We want to show you that. And thankful for flooding your world before the peace.
[time=3334] Help us to worship more than singing. Giving readers to hands and feet. We have been blessed.
[time=3349] Now I want to be a blessing. We have been loved. Now we're going to bring love. We've been divided.
[time=3362] We're going to share the invitation. We have been changed. You've been changed. You've been changed.
[time=3378] Thank you for this new life. Thank you for the invitation. God, we want to live it loud.
[time=3393] And not to shake the nation. Sing your name. We have been saved. Going to shout about the Savior.
[time=3406] We have been found. We're going to turn over at the store. And we make the power to love the world to
[time=3416] happen. We have been changed. You've been changed. You've been changed. We have been changed. You've
[time=3426] been changed. You've been changed. We have been changed. You've been changed. You've been changed.
[time=3453] God, thank you for the morning and thanks for the chance to be together and thank you, God, for the reminder of what we are to be about. Not attending, but following. Not just listening,
[time=3465] God, but being engaged in every part of our life. God, thank you for the help that we know you want
[time=3471] to give us and the willingness that you have to lead us in that direction. We look forward to that.
[time=3477] And we look forward to being together again soon. If that be your will in your son's precious name,
[time=3483] we pray. Amen.
