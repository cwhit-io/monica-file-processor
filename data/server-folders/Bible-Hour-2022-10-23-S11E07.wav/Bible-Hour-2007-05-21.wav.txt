[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=30] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the
[time=44] end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=74] Offer of salvation, heroes encunker the grave, Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=91] Take me as you fight, so take me as you fight me.
[time=103] With all my fears and failures, for dear my life, oh I feel, give my life to follow,
[time=117] everything I believe in.
[time=120] And now I surrender.
[time=131] Say, don't keep it to the mountains, my God is fighting to stay.
[time=140] He is fighting to stay forever after a salvation.
[time=149] He knows and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=157] To know he can do the mountains, my God is fighting to stay.
[time=166] He is fighting to stay forever after a salvation.
[time=175] He knows and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=194] Jesus shut your life, shut your light and let the whole world see.
[time=201] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=207] Jesus shut your light and let the whole world see.
[time=214] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=221] And save your, he can do the mountains, my God is fighting to stay.
[time=230] He is fighting to stay forever after a salvation.
[time=239] Heroes encunker the grave, Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=247] Say, don't keep it to the mountains, my God is fighting to stay.
[time=256] He is fighting to stay forever after a salvation.
[time=265] He knows and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=279] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=285] Jesus shut your light and let the whole world see.
[time=292] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=299] Jesus shut your light and let the whole world see.
[time=305] Sing it for the glory of the risen king.
[time=315] I love that song and the truth that it declares.
[time=323] You remember last month when Pastor Rick Hawks was with us.
[time=328] He shared that that song had been so meaningful to him and his wife as their son was serving overseas in Iraq.
[time=335] And God was faithful to that family and he was mighty to save and he brought the Hawks son home from war.
[time=343] And that was just a sweet reunion for that family to be able to welcome him back home to Fort Wayne.
[time=351] There's a scripture that makes me think of that concept and it's in Zephaniah, one that you probably don't read very often,
[time=358] but it just says really simply, the Lord our God is with you.
[time=362] He is mighty to save.
[time=365] He delights over you.
[time=367] He quiets you with his love and he rejoices over you with singing.
[time=373] And the truth of the matter is that scripture just states it really plainly that our God is mighty to save.
[time=380] And in the case of the Hawks family, he was mighty to save and he brought that boy back from home.
[time=386] But even if he wouldn't have come home from war, God is still mighty to save regardless of circumstances,
[time=393] regardless of what God chooses to allow to happen in this world in the time that we live in.
[time=399] He is mighty to save.
[time=402] This weekend is a special weekend for a lot of people.
[time=406] A chance to remember casualties of war and just to express gratefulness and that's why we all stop working for a day,
[time=415] to just say thank you to men and women who have served and died in wars past and present.
[time=422] And for those of you who have spouses and children and some parents even in the room today, I don't know who all of you are, but if you've got someone that you love over on the other side of the world fighting on behalf of this country,
[time=434] I just want you to hear from us. Thank you.
[time=437] We love you, we love your family, and we pray that our God who is mighty to save will do an amazing work
[time=444] and whatever needs to be done in that situation.
[time=447] [AMEN]
[time=455] We're just going to kind of pause here for a little bit.
[time=458] We've got a video that we want to share and a song that just kind of helps us remember all that we should on this special occasion.
[time=465] Take a look.
[time=477] [MUSIC - 107 seconds]
[time=590] Somewhere a trumpet sounds in the night, a soldier is standing there.
[time=600] It's calling him out to the stars and the stripes.
[time=605] It's calling him God knows way.
[time=609] He kisses the ones he loves goodbye, leaves in the dead of night.
[time=619] For freedom he'll hear the call, leave all he knows.
[time=626] And for freedom he'll stand and fight.
[time=631] [MUSIC]
[time=641] And somewhere a man and wife can't believe they're waving their girl goodbye.
[time=650] For gone are the days of pigtails and curls and candlelit lullabies.
[time=659] If they had the way she'd stay and before we could never be far by before.
[time=669] [MUSIC]
[time=691] And somewhere a thunderous crash in the night.
[time=696] It echoes all through the hills.
[time=701] Though many escape it's right and it's rage, a soldier lies wounded still.
[time=711] Remembering the land he loves you by.
[time=716] I love you with all my mind.
[time=720] For freedom said and her son, whatever comes.
[time=728] For freedom I'll say goodbye.
[time=733] [MUSIC - 45 seconds]
[time=800] Hi and welcome to the Bible Hour. Again, my name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving a senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=808] And we are very thankful, so thankful for you.
[time=812] You may be tuning in for the very first time. You may be a regular part of our broadcast family.
[time=818] Either way, it is great to be with you again.
[time=821] And I want to tell you about two things coming up that as part of the Black Hawk family we'd want you to be very, very aware of.
[time=827] One is a new series that we're going to begin, a new teaching series this next Sunday on June 3.
[time=833] We begin a series entitled Heaven, Angels, Clouds, Harps, or is there more?
[time=841] And the basic idea there is this.
[time=844] So many times people today function with what we believe is kind of a misconception about Heaven.
[time=851] There are so many questions about eternity.
[time=854] There are so many misunderstandings about what all of that entails.
[time=858] I think sometimes our misconceptions and understandings really limit us in terms of how we really view eternity and how much we look forward to it.
[time=868] And so our hope is over these next several weeks that we could jump into the scriptures and look and see for ourselves what the Bible really does teach about Heaven, about eternity.
[time=878] And our hope is that in answering some of these questions, I don't think we can answer all of them, but our hope is in answering many of them.
[time=886] You will be encouraged, and we will be people who have a better understanding of what is to come and what it will be like to be with him forever.
[time=895] Hey, I also want to just invite you to mark this day on your calendar, Saturday, June 9.
[time=900] Saturday, June 9, a great opportunity for you and our broadcast family, anybody in our community, obviously the whole Black Hawk family is going to be a part of this, our generous living garage sale.
[time=913] We hope it's going to be just an enormous, enormous garage sale right here on our campus, Saturday, June 9, all day long.
[time=920] And here's what I want to say to you, if you have any items, if you've got stuff in your attic, if you've got stuff in that room you hate to go in,
[time=927] if you've got stuff at your workplace, anything that you think would sell.
[time=932] I mean it, anything, we want you to bring it by on the 7th and the 8th, the two days prior to June 9 on Friday and Thursday, leading up to it, we're going to be here on campus, ready to receive whatever it is you might bring.
[time=946] All the proceeds from this garage sale are going to help drill water wells in East Africa and help provide malaria prevention.
[time=955] For those desperately in need of a way to keep themselves safe from the life threatening disease of malaria, any of the clothes and items that don't get sold are going to go right here to Fort Wayne to our growing refugee population.
[time=969] And we couldn't think of a better way to spend a Saturday, so come be a part of it with us, contribute to it, pray about it, and come by and see us.
[time=978] We're really thankful for each and every one of you that tunes in each week and thankful for your partnership and participation and what God allows us to be a part of as we help seekers here and across the world find and then know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=995] Thank you so much.
[time=996] Come by and see us some Sunday morning.
[time=998] God bless you and have a great week.
[time=1000] (Music)
[time=1030] With my soul, with my soul, it is well, it is well, it is well, with my soul.
[time=1052] (Music)
[time=1058] My sin on the lips of this glorious song, my sin not in part but the home.
[time=1084] These hail to the cross, and I bear in no more, praise to the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul.
[time=1109] It is well, with my soul, it is well, it is well, with my soul.
[time=1136] (Music) You are a place, my soul, my soul, my soul.
[time=1155] (Music)
[time=1180] The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall resound, even so, it is well, with my soul.
[time=1205] It is well, with my soul, it is well, it is well, with my soul.
[time=1234] It is well, with my soul, my soul, with my soul.
[time=1253] It is well, with my soul, it is well, it is well, it is well, with my soul.
[time=1282] (Music)
[time=1296] God, when life is like a peaceful river, and when life is like a raging sea,
[time=1306] whether we have great need or we have great plenty, whether life is safe or dangerous,
[time=1324] whether things are coasting along and it seems like everything is really easy, or things might be a little rough, seems like everything is going against us.
[time=1339] We pray that we would have the mind of Christ, and that we would know our inner being that it is well.
[time=1353] God, I pray that you would have mercy on us because so often we worry and we get fearful,
[time=1360] and we forget who you are and who you promise to be, and we think that we have to handle life on our own,
[time=1366] and that it is all weighing down on our shoulders when we can really just give our burdens to you
[time=1374] and trust that you are going to be everything that you say you are going to be, you are so faithful, you never fail,
[time=1384] you never mess up, and just pray that you would increase our faith, you would increase our trust,
[time=1391] that you would increase our dependency upon you, that you would increase our reliance upon you.
[time=1401] God, I pray that we would be a people who trust in the Lord with all of our hearts and that we wouldn't lean on our own understandings because God, our understandings don't make sense, and I pray that in all of our ways we would acknowledge you and that you would do just like you say
[time=1418] and make our paths straight.
[time=1423] And we pray that all of these things would be for your glory, for the advancement of your kingdom,
[time=1431] and we pray these things in the name of your Son Jesus who gives us boldness to approach your throne.
[time=1439] Amen. You may be seated.
[time=1448] Last week, we talked about vision. Last week I came to you at kind of the conclusion, if you will,
[time=1456] of what had been about a year and a half study and a time that our elders here at Blackhawk, we had committed to about a year, year and a half of just very thoughtfully, very carefully, very prayerfully thinking through what is it in this day, in this time, that how is it that God would want to, if He would want to, refocus our efforts and our intentions here as a ministry.
[time=1480] I drew that graph for you last week. We don't want to be a place where mission and passion is waning,
[time=1487] where simply survival or routine is climbing. That's not who we want to be.
[time=1492] And so we just went before God and spent some time, I told you this, we studied the Gospels and the Book of Acts.
[time=1498] Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, along with the Book of Acts.
[time=1501] And the reason we did that is because we had this burning question.
[time=1505] And I don't know if it's a burning question of yours, but it was and continues to be a burning question of ours.
[time=1511] As you look at the Gospels, as you look at the ministry of Jesus, as you look at the birth of the church in the Book of Acts,
[time=1518] how is it that in that day people followed?
[time=1523] Those who were following Him, those who were His disciples, those who had given everything to give themselves to Him
[time=1532] and to this unbelievable endeavor as the kingdom of God began to move forward.
[time=1537] How is it that they lived? How is it that they thought? How is it that they responded?
[time=1543] We talk about wanting to be a place that helps seeking people find Him and then know what it means to follow Him.
[time=1551] And we don't just say it to say it, it really is so very important to us that you would be, that we would be followers today.
[time=1559] Yes, this is an amazing story, an amazing true story of how they followed Him then.
[time=1565] We want to be a people.
[time=1568] Well, I want to be someone and I want you to be a part of something with me where we're about that very thing.
[time=1574] We came up with in our study, we kind of came up with kind of a composite of what we saw.
[time=1580] I showed it to you last week, look at it again, kind of the marks, if you will, the characteristics of a disciple.
[time=1585] If you are in the room today, today in this time, today here in our setting, in this culture, if you're here in the room today
[time=1593] and you raise your hand and you're saying with me, I'm a Christ follower.
[time=1597] I have surrendered my heart and life to Him and I want to live in such a way as to honor and please Him and bring great glory to Him.
[time=1606] Here's what we found in the Scriptures that your life and mine should increasingly look like.
[time=1614] Disciples, Christ followers were learners, they were learners.
[time=1618] I didn't show you this last week, but go with me if you would to Acts chapter 2.
[time=1622] Would you go there? Let me just show you something here about their learning appetite.
[time=1627] Acts chapter 2, in verse 41, it says, "So then those who had received His word were baptized and that day there were added about 3,000 souls."
[time=1639] And look at what it says in verse 42, I love this, "They were those who were saved, those who were now following Christ.
[time=1645] They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship and to the breaking of bread and to prayer."
[time=1655] I want you to look at that first line, "They were continually devoting themselves to the teaching."
[time=1664] What I want you to see and sense is that in this day, in this time, with so much at stake, with the persecution that was around them and that was to come in this setting as these people received the word as they gave themselves to the Lord,
[time=1682] as they now began to follow Him in that setting, they gave themselves to the apostles' teaching and what is implied and so very clear is that the apostles were willing to be teaching them continually.
[time=1701] When you study that word and you cross-reference it through the book of Acts, oftentimes it's consistently used with the phrase "day by what? Day."
[time=1714] And I don't think we're going to undo hundreds of years of tradition, you know, right here today or in these next few months, but the fact of the matter is, my friends, is that I need, I'll speak for me.
[time=1726] I probably, with all that's at stake, with all that's on the line, with all that's coming my way, with all that I experience and see day after day, with all of the attacks, with all of the temptations, with all of the ministry possibilities, with all that is there, in an effort to follow Christ, I probably need this.
[time=1747] I probably need someone to help me with this more than once a week for 35 minutes. Anybody agree with that? Raise your hand.
[time=1758] So I'm coming to your house now, nightly. We're going to start a tour. I'm going to be coming every night. No, just kidding, but not a bad idea.
[time=1769] I mean, in concept, it meant so much to them. They were so in need of it, and they were so hungry for it that they were continually, day by day, house to house, giving themselves to learning.
[time=1787] My friends, followers of Christ are learners. They followed faithfully. Let me just say this to you. You might want to just make a few notes as we go through the list. They followed faithfully.
[time=1797] I want to just point out here that they were obedient. They were obedient. Christ said to them, "Go into all the what?" And here we are.
[time=1808] Remember that. Remember that. Remember that. It's kind of hard to get your mind around. I realize. But just remember that they were faithful to the call that God gave them.
[time=1818] And that you and I are here today that this is in existence because 11, 12 faithful ragtag dudes that didn't have a lot of education but were passionate.
[time=1832] It took them a while, made some mistakes, but in the end they gave their lives to it, and the gospel went around the world.
[time=1840] And we're here today because of their faithfulness. Left everything. Christ's disciples, our elders, as we studied the gospels and the book of Acts, we came to see that true followers of Christ were willing to leave everything to advance the kingdom.
[time=1857] It was great sacrifice being made. They paid a price. That's right. They paid a price. Right there we talked last week about the fact that many of them, many of the 12, and so many others, especially in the early days of the church, my friends, because they raised their hands like you just did.
[time=1876] Because they raised their hands and publicly committed to follow Christ. They lost their life. They were martyred. They were killed. They were tortured. They were beaten. They were separated from families.
[time=1891] Somebody asked me once, how in the world could you ever really do that? How in the world could you ever really make that choice? Somebody told me a while ago, and you might want to write this down. It's one worth keeping. When values are clear, decisions are easy.
[time=1908] When values, what you truly deep down in your gut believe to be true and right. When values are clear, decisions are easy.
[time=1919] They modeled Christ's heart throughout the gospels in the book of Acts. We see Christ's disciples, his followers, modeling Christ's heart to the broken.
[time=1930] Let me just have you write this phrase down underneath that or next to it. They had there again and again. We see followers of Christ. We see his disciples with their redemptive antenna up.
[time=1942] They modeled Christ's heart for the broken. You read through the gospels. You'll see that wherever Christ went, he had the antenna up.
[time=1952] Wherever he was going, it was as if he had some sonar, some radar thing going, and it would just again and again lead him to the broken. Again and again lead him to the hurting.
[time=1963] The antenna are up and he's willing to come and be by their side and minister to them. These followers of Christ, they modeled Christ's heart for the broken, redemptive antenna up. Turn to Acts 16, if you will.
[time=1977] Acts 16, verse 25 to 34. What an amazing situation we come to here. Paul and Silas have been thrown into prison.
[time=1992] They have been doing what Christ called them to do. They're proclaiming the gospel, establishing churches, strengthening these churches, seeing people come to faith.
[time=2002] They get into a little bit of trouble here and it says in verse 25 at about midnight. They're thrown in jail in verse 24 into the inner prison, the deepest, darkest part of the prison, fastened their feet in the stocks.
[time=2015] They're in solitary confinement, most likely in a wet dungeon type room, but about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God.
[time=2026] And the prisoners were listening to them and suddenly there came a great earthquake so that the foundation of the prison house, the foundations of the prison house were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.
[time=2042] Everybody's free. Everybody gets a pass. Everybody's out and running. No more prison. No more stocks. No more jailer. No more torture. Boom. God moves.
[time=2055] The doors fly open. The chains drop out. They go except for Paul.
[time=2061] Because when the jailer awoke, the one responsible for all these prisoners and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
[time=2074] But Paul, with his redemptive antenna up, with his understanding of how much that man in his world, how much he meant to the Savior, Paul cried out with a loud voice saying, "Don't harm yourself, for we are all here."
[time=2090] And he called for lights and rushed in and trembling with fear.
[time=2095] The jailer fell down before Paul and Silas rushed in. See, Paul and Silas didn't even leave the room.
[time=2104] Fell down before Paul and Silas and after he brought them out, he said, "Sir, what must I do to be saved?"
[time=2110] They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household." And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house, and he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized.
[time=2126] He and all his household. And he brought them into his house and set food before them and rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his whole household.
[time=2137] Amen? Every encounter, a divine appointment. And 10 up with this great opportunity God gives you as a follower to pass along Christ's heart for the broken.
[time=2151] We saw in our study, our elders, as we looked at the gospels in the book of Acts, we saw their willingness to sacrifice.
[time=2159] Christ followers, like you and me, willing to sacrifice, to see the church strengthened and lost people redeemed. Go back a few pages to Acts 14.
[time=2169] It's been a few years since we studied this and looked at this as a family. Look at Acts 14, 19.
[time=2176] It says there, "But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium," let me stop you there. "Where they've come to is a place called Lestra." Paul, and the journey here through the book of Acts, has come to Lestra.
[time=2187] Paul, follower of Christ, wanting nothing more than to strengthen the church and see, through a strengthened church, lost souls redeemed and people coming to faith.
[time=2198] He does what God calls him to do in Lestra. In Lestra, the response is a bit frenzied and here we have Jews from Antioch who don't want Paul preaching the gospel.
[time=2208] And Iconium, they've come and they've won over the crowds, as it says there in verse 19. And having won over the crowds, look at that, they stoned Paul.
[time=2221] They dragged him out of the, they stoned Paul on the spot and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
[time=2230] Now, here's the thing about this. I want to just make sure you understand. These were people who were accustomed.
[time=2235] You and I, if we heard about a stoning downtown, it would be completely contrary to what we would know or have experienced as acceptable or normal, but this was something that went on.
[time=2246] These were people who had stoned others before. These were people who had seen stoned dead bodies. I'm just trying to make the point.
[time=2255] I don't think they held back on him. I think they stoned him and I think they thought he was dead.
[time=2262] I think he went through a great deal. I love this. I love this verse 20. But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and look at this. He got up and he ran as fast as he could away from that city where all those people were that had just stoned him.
[time=2279] Is that what your Bible says?
[time=2284] Wow. But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day, so he just needs to catch his breath after being stoned to death.
[time=2295] The next day, he went away with Barnabas to Derby after they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples. They returned to where? Lister.
[time=2313] Right back to the scene of the crime because the church meant that much. The gospel meant that much. Back to Lister and to Iconium and to Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith and saying through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom of God.
[time=2336] My friends, if you raise your hand this morning, what we have found as elders in our study of the Gospels and the Book of Acts is that as a disciple, you will be a learner. You will be a faithful follower. You'll be willing to leave things behind pay. Whatever price we may need to pay, model Christ's heart for the broken sacrifice to see the church strengthened and lost people to deem. Look at that last one.
[time=2359] We saw this again and again and again through the Gospels and the Book of Acts. They loved each other deeply, Acts 4. Just look at that with me for a moment, would you? Acts 4, verse 32.
[time=2373] And the congregation, that's you. That's me. And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart, not many, not divided, not separated, but they were of one heart and soul. And not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own. Quickly if you would, just do a quick recap of all that you own.
[time=2394] Quickly, just if you would in your mind, just go ahead and rattle off in the rolodex of your head, all of the things that belong to you.
[time=2405] Not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own. It was a great view of stewardship even in these early days, but all things were common property to them.
[time=2416] And with great power, the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all, for there was not a needy person among them.
[time=2428] I don't think it meant that everybody was at the exact same level. I don't think it says that. I don't think it implies that.
[time=2435] I think what it says is there was not a needy person among them. Some for sure made this much, others for sure, just like today make this much.
[time=2445] The fact of the matter is there was among them not a needy person because of the generosity with which they lived because of the great love and devotion they had for each other.
[time=2465] For there was not a needy person among them for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales and lay them at the apostles' feet and they would be distributed to each.
[time=2475] In your bulletin, you've got a pink insert. It's our generous living garage sale.
[time=2483] And I understand, listen, I understand how this kind of funny first dollar had dawned on me. I understand how far short this falls from the biblical record we just read.
[time=2496] We're basically going to go home you and I and get a bunch of stuff that we don't want, that we don't want.
[time=2503] Just laugh at yourself with me, please.
[time=2506] We're going to go get a bunch of stuff. I doubt many of you are going to go home and say no, no, no, no, forget the attic, we're going to the great room.
[time=2516] Let's go sell the stuff that we like the most.
[time=2525] I'm not going to change this whole thing up right here, don't sweat it, but I'm just saying this is a great beginning, okay?
[time=2531] And maybe there will be a day when you and I will go home and do that, but for now would you understand the great opportunity to really go home and get whatever it is you would feel led to get.
[time=2540] To dig out whatever it is you would feel led to dig out to bring next Sunday and place behind your car.
[time=2547] And yes, we still need helpers to help pick up stuff behind cars, bottom of that sheet.
[time=2553] Would you go home? Would you bring your big ticket items on Thursday and Friday, the seventh and the eighth?
[time=2559] Would you tell your friends? Would you tell your family? Would you tell your coworkers?
[time=2563] Would you do everything within your power to see as much stuff good or bad brought here so that wells can be dug in villages where there is no water?
[time=2576] So that malaria prevention can be provided for a family so they won't die from a mosquito bite.
[time=2583] So that refugees right here in Fort Wayne can be clothed with all of the leftover stuff that we don't get rid of.
[time=2591] My friends, that list right there as our elders and as our staff have studied.
[time=2596] This is the picture of what we believe God would want us to help you experience and grow in.
[time=2605] If you're interested in things other than that, I'll just lovingly say to you today you probably won't get it here in the days to come.
[time=2618] There is going to be an enormous commitment on our part to help you and encourage you and model for you and bring this family with God's help down that kind of road.
[time=2631] I want to just share with you three ministry initiatives that came of our study. Three ministry initiatives. These are just things that we want to say to you this morning as a family.
[time=2644] Our study and our prayer and our time together has led us to say that from the pulpit on a Sunday morning to a small group in a living room to a class for your ten-year-old.
[time=2654] From student ministries to men's ministries to women's ministries, anything inside and outside these four walls that we have any influence on is going to be by and large about these three things for the next 100 years.
[time=2673] I don't know along we're going to just keep at this for a while and we may tweak it now and then but I want you to understand that if you're going to call this place home, we are going to do our very best to make it about by and large these three things.
[time=2687] Here you go. Number one, a huge commitment beginning as soon as we finish our heaven series, we will jump into what will be an ongoing comprehensive training that allows all to see what it means to genuinely follow Christ.
[time=2703] I just want you to see that word teach and understand that from the cradle to the grave and everywhere in between in any setting, we are going to do our very best to again and again and again set out for you what it looks like. Watch what it looks like to follow Christ in the way you serve, to follow Christ in the way you work, to follow Christ in the way you suffer, to follow Christ in the way you handle resources, to follow Christ in the way you view and interact with the poor
[time=2732] or the marginalized, to follow Christ in the way you communicate and share and live out your faith with those in your life who desperately need to understand what it means to be healed and redeemed.
[time=2745] We're going to do it with first graders. We're going to do it with students. We're going to do it with senior adults. We are going to do our very best to make a renewed commitment to teach this.
[time=2754] And you know what? If it works this way and, you know, like 18 months from now, I overhear a conversation in the foyer and somebody's going, "Can you believe it? They're still teaching about following Christ. I'm going to live with that."
[time=2772] Mitch and I, Mitch and I were talking a couple weeks ago. You know, we did a few Sundays. I did a few Sundays just about a month ago from Jeremiah 2. Remember the broken cisterns about loving God and loving others?
[time=2784] Mitch and I were talking about how really, I mean, not just like figuratively or theoretically, I mean literally, I could probably teach for two years every Sunday on loving God and loving others and never repeat ourselves once. Do you understand that?
[time=2800] The whole of Scripture is wrapped up in those two commands, loving God. We're going to teach this.
[time=2809] Secondly, write this word down. Connect. Connect. And I want you to watch this video real quick. Go ahead and run it, you guys.
[time=2815] Watch this video and think about the connecting opportunities that the followers of Christ had with others.
[time=2830] [MUSIC - 137 seconds]
[time=2982] You know that someone could be sitting right next to you this morning. They could be right in front of you. They could be right behind you.
[time=2990] They come and they sit in these pews every week. And so many times they come in and they sit and they slip out undetected, unnoticed, unapproached, un pursued.
[time=3003] And sometimes that's your fault and sometimes that's theirs, but fault isn't really the point there. I just want to remind you that followers of Christ have antenna that are up.
[time=3015] Because they so want to be able to abide by what we see in the New Testament, especially kind of we've labeled them the one another's.
[time=3027] Let me just read this for you. Straight from the pages of Scripture, God's word says let you, R2 and I, and to be engaged on an ongoing basis in loving one another,
[time=3039] comforting one another, serving each other, being hospitable to one another that involves bringing people, offering them time in your home, admonishing one another, speaking truth, even when it's tough.
[time=3056] Speaking truth to one another, confessing sin. When was the last time that with a close and trusted friend, you sat down with them, not because they're Jesus and not because they're anything other than a good friend?
[time=3074] And the Scripture says that yes, having confessed our sins to the Lord, here in the one another's, we're told we get to confess our sins to each other.
[time=3085] When was the last time you looked a good and trusted friend in the face and said, could I just have a few minutes? I need to just share with you some things that I've done, some thoughts that I've harbored, some choices I've made.
[time=3103] Here to bear one another's burdens, we are to be devoted to each other, be devoted, like, like really committed to each other.
[time=3118] Like I got your back, like I'll do my very best to stand with you, like I'm not going to believe it about you until I come and talk to you about it.
[time=3127] I'm going to be devoted to you. We are to pray for Christ followers, are to pray for each other. We are to accept one another.
[time=3137] That might come into play, having heard me confess my sins to you.
[time=3144] I might need you at that moment to still accept me and to love me and then to be willing to pray for me. See, they're all so related.
[time=3152] We are to forgive each other. We are to build up one another, encourage one another.
[time=3159] We are to spur the heel and the sign of the horse idea that, come on, we're to spur each other on to love and good deeds.
[time=3171] We are, as elders, making a commitment to you as a family this morning to in the days ahead teach and in the days ahead connect to do everything we can to see Christ followers in this family, living and sharing life together in Biblical community.
[time=3190] Where you can love and be loved, where you can serve and be served, where you can encourage and be encouraged.
[time=3197] It's the difference between the pew, which isn't a bad place, we've talked about that, and a living room with 8, 9, 10, 12 folks who are deeply committed to you, you to them, each other committed to the spiritual growth and application of the truth that we've tried to teach.
[time=3213] We're making a commitment this morning to teach you and help you connect in small communities, in smaller settings, and then lastly reach.
[time=3223] And this might to some seem very specific, but I want you to bear with me on this because I want you to think about this, reach.
[time=3230] We want to, we want to, because of our study of the Gospels, because of our study of the book of Acts, and as we've prayed about this, we feel God leading us to really up, really increase our effort to reach future generations of Christ followers through Black Hawk's unique, I love the way they said this, Black Hawk's unique discipleship platform.
[time=3252] Known as Black Hawk Christian School, you know what, you may be a part of this family, and your child may not attend Black Hawk Christian, and that's just great, it's okay, it's always been that way with me, you know that.
[time=3264] Your child needs to be where your child needs to be, and you as part of this family, we want you to, you know, sleep easy, and know that this is a ministry of our church, and it is for some, and it may not be for others, a place for your kid to come and be grown and educated, no big deal,
[time=3281] but no matter where your kid goes, if you're a part of this family, it's a ministry of this church, and my friends, think about it, between 8 and 900 kids a day,
[time=3292] between 8 and 900 kids on a regular basis, we get to speak into their lives, and those 8 to 900 have moms and dads, those 8 to 900s have grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters and neighbors.
[time=3308] What an enormous opportunity, what a privilege, and we want to simply see that privilege, our school and its ministry, grown and expanded.
[time=3320] You know, I've actually been in recent months, I mean it's still very much in a germane, very, you know, minuscule state, but think about this, we've been approached in recent days.
[time=3330] I've had people approach me about the possibility of satellite, Blackhawk Christian school elementary campuses and other quadrants of the city.
[time=3342] What would that be like to be able to take this unique discipleship platform and see an opportunity in northwest Fort Wayne, in southeast Fort Wayne?
[time=3353] The possibilities are countless, and we are looking forward to the three.
[time=3358] Now look at this, just want you to know this, there's going to be a whole lot more coming in the days to come, but the elders and staff, as we've thought this through, we are ready in the fall to actually begin a capital campaign.
[time=3369] A capital campaign, that phrase, to some of you it makes you nervous, others if you don't know what it means, there are some in the room who have been through countless projects of that nature.
[time=3379] A capital campaign is really an opportunity for us as a family, to put our arms around a vision, and to make, in this case, we're going to be asking for a three year, a prayerfully thought through on your part between you and God, a prayerful commitment.
[time=3394] And you're going to hear all about it in the days to come, some of the things that we'd like to do with this project, a financial commitment over and above, over and above for me, over and above for you, the opportunity to make a three year commitment.
[time=3408] With those funds going towards things like this, a compassion, a compassion fund, a chance to kind of refurbish and update our elementary school, we've talked about eliminating debt.
[time=3424] I mean, there's been some great conversations, all of which, all the things included in this project that will bring to you in the fall, all of them having to do with us wanting to be a place that hasn't even brought our reach in its efforts to teach and make disciples of Jesus Christ, followers.
[time=3445] Some of those opportunities may involve buildings, others of those opportunities probably won't, but we can't wait to bring it to you and tell you more about what that's going to look like.
[time=3456] Teaching, connecting, reaching, these are the things that we'll give ourselves to, and I hope, I hope you'll give some thought to being a part of that journey with us in the days to come.
[time=3468] Would you stand and let me pray for us as we go? God, thanks for the morning. Thank you so much for this family and thank you for the truth that guides us. Bring us back together again soon. That be your will and your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=3481] God bless you. Have a great day.
