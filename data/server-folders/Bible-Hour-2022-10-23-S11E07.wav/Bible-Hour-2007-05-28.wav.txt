[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[time=28] and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=53] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we want to welcome
[time=66] you to the Bible Hour.
[time=67] We are so thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=70] I hope you get encouraged today, and I want to just take a minute and tell you about three things that are really important.
[time=77] To me, three things I think most of you would probably benefit from knowing about, and here they are.
[time=83] Number one, I want you to know about our summer camps this summer.
[time=86] We have some great, great opportunities with our summer camps.
[time=91] We've got basketball camp, we've got a soccer camp, we have a fine arts camp.
[time=96] There are a number of camp opportunities for kids, kids of all ages, and all you've got to do to learn more about the camps, and even sign up for the camps, just go to our website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=107] Right there on our homepage, if you just scroll down on the sides, you'll just see places where you can click on and learn more about our summer camps, and I would encourage you, you and your kids, your kids' friends, kids in the neighborhood, just think about the impact that we could have on some of the young people in your life.
[time=125] We'd love to get to know them, we'd love to make an investment in them, so think about it.
[time=130] Summer camps, go to our website and check it out.
[time=133] Also when you go to our website, there's a couple of things I want to point out to you.
[time=137] On the homepage there, at the top where it says resources, again, some people still haven't figured this out.
[time=143] You can now, at any time during your week, you can watch our video cast.
[time=149] You can see basically the Bible Hour broadcast right there, minus whatever worship or other
[time=156] things were included in the broadcast, just the message portion of the broadcast.
[time=160] You can watch that online through a video stream, and we are so thankful for the ability
[time=166] to do that.
[time=167] We want you to know about that.
[time=169] We also want you to be able to share that with others who you know.
[time=172] We're so thankful for our broadcast.
[time=174] I'm so grateful for the team that makes that broadcast possible each and every week.
[time=180] So tell your friends about it, blackhawkministries.org, click on resources, and then you can just go to where it says watch, and I hope it'll be an encouragement to you.
[time=189] I also want to say this to you on the website, again, this is kind of a website insert.
[time=195] On the website, there's a place where you can sign up to be a part of my personal email list.
[time=200] I would love it.
[time=201] For a part of this list, it's a growing list of over 1,000 folks, and I just periodically
[time=207] want to tell you, share with you what's on my heart.
[time=210] I'd love for you to just go on the website on the homepage down, I think on the right hand side, you can fill out just a brief little summary of how we can get you on that list.
[time=219] We'd love to have you there.
[time=220] I'd love to be able to communicate with you personally.
[time=223] We're so thankful for, again, this partnership that we have.
[time=227] We're so thankful that you tune in week after week, and again, our hope is that your heart and your mind are being encouraged in your journey with Christ.
[time=236] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=237] Hey, have a great, great day, a great rest of your week, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=243] God bless.
[time=245] What do you think heaven is like?
[time=247] Well, according to the Bible, the streets are paved with gold, so I think it's a great place.
[time=252] I think heaven can be, a lot of different things, it can be what you make of a place, it can be a life after, it can be life at home, it can be a lot of different things.
[time=263] Peace.
[time=264] Happiness.
[time=265] It's a place where good people go.
[time=269] I think it's a golden place where God lives, and you just rise up there if you're a good
[time=276] person in your life.
[time=277] Vacation.
[time=278] A getaway place.
[time=280] A getaway, and then you come back from it?
[time=283] Hopefully, maybe.
[time=285] That's how good you are, yes.
[time=287] They can live as good a life as they want, but if they haven't professed Christ as their Savior, they're not going to go to heaven.
[time=294] Honey?
[time=296] If you're a Christian, heaven is a place you're going to go when you die.
[time=300] Will everyone end up there?
[time=301] No.
[time=302] Vacation or fact, I'm not sure.
[time=304] I'm not sure.
[time=305] There are philosophical questions I can't really answer too well at the top of my head.
[time=309] When you go to heaven, do you see people that you may have known when you were here?
[time=314] Yeah.
[time=315] What do you think heaven is?
[time=317] Wow.
[time=318] A beautiful girl.
[time=320] Well, I believe that heaven and hell are here on earth and that we create it on a daily
[time=326] basis.
[time=327] So if we're good to people, we live by the golden rules, then we have a good life.
[time=335] It's a place for those that accept Jesus into their heart and no Christ as your Savior,
[time=342] but without that there's no hope for them.
[time=345] They're an eternity someplace else, which is a place called hell.
[time=349] I really don't think much about hell.
[time=352] I mean, you saw the characters of hell and people have the unbelief of what hell is.
[time=358] Some people think hell could be right here on earth.
[time=360] For some people, not here on Orange County, perhaps, but elsewhere.
[time=365] What would hell be like?
[time=366] Hot.
[time=367] Yeah.
[time=368] Hot.
[time=369] It's really really hot.
[time=370] A burning area where people who don't do well end up.
[time=377] It's like the retail business.
[time=383] No, I think it's probably a pretty miserable place.
[time=387] It's dark, fiery place where everyone needs to drink in water.
[time=391] You know, fiery, fiery gates and bad stuff.
[time=395] Oh, it's not good.
[time=396] I've been there.
[time=397] When were you there?
[time=399] Two years ago maybe.
[time=401] Doing what?
[time=403] Visiting for a short while.
[time=407] You know, the vision is of fire and brimstone, but whatever it is going to be miserable.
[time=412] I don't know.
[time=413] I don't know if it's hot.
[time=414] It's just miserable.
[time=415] That's all I know.
[time=416] Not where I want to be.
[time=417] If we don't consider other people's feelings or whatever and create a lot of damage, then
[time=423] we get that directly back like instant karma and then it creates a hell around us.
[time=430] Hell describes itself.
[time=431] What do you mean?
[time=433] I don't even want to think about it.
[time=434] Read Revelation.
[time=435] Is there life after death?
[time=436] I don't know.
[time=437] Fiction or fact?
[time=439] I'm not a very religious person, it's hard to say.
[time=443] I don't know, it's something that, you know, we just have to wait until we die.
[time=473] In the mansions, bright and blessed, he'll prepare for us a place.
[time=488] Surrounded by his glory, what will our hearts feel?
[time=493] We dance, but Jesus, or in all of him be still.
[time=499] When we stand in his presence, to an ease where we fall, what we sing, hallelujah, we be
[time=509] able to speak it all.
[time=514] Oh, when we sing Jesus, you can only imagine.
[time=528] Oh, I'm waiting for another time and another fix, where my hopes and dreams will be captured
[time=543] with a woman, look at Jesus' eyes.
[time=548] My heart's been burning, my soul keeps in.
[time=554] Sometimes I can't hardly wait for the sweet, sweet someday, and now we sweat away to another
[time=570] time and another fix.
[time=573] My heart's been burning, my soul keeps shining.
[time=584] Sometimes I can't hardly wait for the sweet, sweet someday, and now we sweat away to another
[time=598] time and another fix, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh
[time=625] dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear,
[time=733] [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=790] (orchestral music) - I am thankful that you're here, and I really am looking forward to these next several weeks, harps, clouds, and angels, or more.
[time=804] Or is there more to this great truth of glorification?
[time=810] And we talk about theology.
[time=812] You talk about salvation and regeneration and sanctification and justification.
[time=817] Well, at the end of all that, is this amazing truth that we find in the Scriptures that deals with our personal and eternal glorification, being made right and being made to be in the presence of God forever and ever, heaven.
[time=832] It's an amazing topic, and we're gonna dive in and give it our very best over the weeks to come.
[time=838] As we jump into it this morning, I was riding in this morning with my son.
[time=841] My oldest son, he and I were together in the car earlier today, and he leaned over like only a kid can do, and said, "Dad, what's this morning gonna be about?" And I said, "Heaven," and he said, "Well, no, what's it gonna be about?" And I love the question, and I love what kids' questions often lead us to do, and that is to just respond finally very clearly.
[time=863] And I wanna just be clear with you this morning that today, our intent, I think, is really to address in kind of an introductory way.
[time=872] I wanna address what I think is a very, very foundational issue.
[time=875] In this discussion, in this idea of heaven, and how it affects how you and I relate to it, what we think of it.
[time=883] And what I wanna say is this.
[time=884] I really believe, I want you to think about a couple of words.
[time=886] I want you to think about our longing for heaven, and I want you to think about our anticipation of heaven.
[time=894] I want you to think about this idea of heaven, and how it is that you long for how you anticipate, how you can't wait to get to be in and experience heaven.
[time=908] Now, the fact of the matter is that, as I've talked with you about this, as we've discussed this over the last several weeks, and I've had many conversations.
[time=916] I've heard you say what you've heard me say back to you, and that is that there is, in many of us, a lack, an absence of that kind of not all of us.
[time=930] But in many of us, a real absence of that sense of longing and anticipation.
[time=935] If I talk to you about a game coming up next week, if I talk to you about a golf weekend with eight buddies, if I talk to you about shopping with three of your best friends, if we talk about a party we're gonna go to, if we talk about a vacation destination that we're headed to in two months, boy, oh boy, we can all of a sudden become very animated and very excited, the anticipation and the longing levels can go way up, right?
[time=961] We can't wait for some of these things.
[time=968] But when I say to you heaven, how's your anticipation level?
[time=975] What's your longing gauge reading?
[time=980] Truth of the matter is, in many of the conversations, in many of the emails that are coming in these days, most of us in the room share the same struggle.
[time=989] It's not what we believe in our hearts at what it should be.
[time=994] And this morning, back to my son's question, this morning I want to address that.
[time=1000] I think this morning as we start into the series, there are two fundamental problems that we experience that really diminish our longing for and our anticipation of heaven.
[time=1013] And the first one I just want to introduce to you by way of a picture.
[time=1018] It's a picture I think that I've shown you before.
[time=1022] It's a picture of me and Brent Imer and Jason Mayley and Andrew Mayley and a group of really, really dear men, some guys who became very, very good friends of mine.
[time=1033] There you go, you see them right there.
[time=1035] You remember, raise your hand if you remember me going to Russia a couple of years ago.
[time=1040] Yeah, thanks.
[time=1041] I had the incredible privilege of going with our team over to Ivanovo.
[time=1045] And we went over to Ivanovo to help just come alongside, to care for, to continue to invest in a group of 25 pastors from that region,
[time=1055] faithful guys who love the Lord, they love the kingdom, they're doing their very best to pastor in a very difficult setting over there, Slavic Gospel Association and about six other local churches, Black Hawks, become part of a team.
[time=1068] And on about a quarterly basis, we're sending small teams of senior pastors and others from that guy's church over there to teach and equip and come alongside these guys and love on them as best we can.
[time=1081] I'll tell you what, it was something that absolutely changed me and it changed me down deep.
[time=1087] I've showed you this picture I think before.
[time=1089] These are some special guys, my friends.
[time=1092] These are guys, these are faithful men who, they lived anywhere from about 10 to 500 miles away from Ivanovo and where we held the conference.
[time=1104] These men, they look forward to this time like nothing you would have ever imagined.
[time=1111] The opportunity to be together, the opportunity to be encouraged, the opportunity to be taught, many of them begged, they begged rides to this, many of them hitchhiked, many of them spent whatever money they had extra to try and figure out a way to come
[time=1129] and be a part of this setting.
[time=1131] They were dear special men who in the day to day of life have absolutely nothing really.
[time=1139] This was evidenced in a number of different ways.
[time=1142] I'll never forget Talon Jason and Brent about halfway through the week.
[time=1148] And when I told you this before, I think I felt so bad because about halfway through the week, I began to complain about how bad they smelled.
[time=1154] They smelled bad.
[time=1158] And then what I realized over the next day or so, we were in the same hotel with them.
[time=1163] They had been put up in this hotel and we were in the hotel.
[time=1166] And it dawned on me how excited they were about being in this hotel.
[time=1170] And I'm telling you what, it wasn't anything, anything.
[time=1174] I mean, it was just nothing. It was a very, you know, as far as what you would think of a hotel, what I would think of a hotel, this place was absolutely nothing and these guys were elated.
[time=1184] I remember thinking they didn't have any suitcases.
[time=1186] I thought, where's their suitcases? I brought a suitcase.
[time=1189] I got all my stuff. I got all my books and all my jeans and all my sweatshirts and all my t-shirts and all my sweatshirts and all my toiletries.
[time=1197] I got my shampoo and my conditioner and I got my gel.
[time=1200] I got my razor, my shaver, the whole nine yards, right? Where's their stuff?
[time=1205] And then it dawned on me about halfway through the week.
[time=1208] They had no suitcases because they had how many outfits? One.
[time=1212] And it was the outfit they came in and they showed up that first day and they were so, it was their very best.
[time=1219] And I remember walking down the hallways at night.
[time=1221] There was one night I walked down the hallway of the hotel and I looked into a room where some of the guys were staying and there were a couple guys taking their outfit and laying it out each night on the dresser.
[time=1233] Just to kind of make it nice, you know?
[time=1236] They didn't have any soap and they didn't have any shampoo so they didn't bring it.
[time=1241] Hotel didn't really have much. So by Wednesday, it smelled.
[time=1247] And they were filled with joy and filled with excitement and filled with anticipation.
[time=1253] And they were the sweetest, kindest men. I'd ever been around my entire life.
[time=1257] But here's the thing.
[time=1259] Very first day of class.
[time=1261] Very first day of class, we all get around the tables.
[time=1264] I'm ready to jump in and as we sit down, Serega, the translator, is sitting right next to me.
[time=1269] And I start to kind of jump into the deal and all of a sudden one of the guys stands up, opens up his Bible and Serega puts his hand on my shoulder and says, "We will have time of devotion."
[time=1280] And I said, "No problem." So this gentleman stands up and he begins to share from his heart and from the scriptures. And the room is absolutely enthralled in every word he says.
[time=1290] There's amen's and there's hallelujah's and there's encouragement being given to this guy.
[time=1296] And he finishes and prays and sits down. And I go to start in and all of a sudden, Serega kind of stops me because they're all getting up and they're walking over to the corner of the room.
[time=1306] And over in the corner of the room is this dilapidated, just messed up, broken down piano.
[time=1313] When I first looked at it, I would have bet you anything, it didn't even work.
[time=1318] And Serega comes over and sits down and he flips up the lid and he starts to play.
[time=1323] And these 25 guys come around this piano and they begin to hold hands.
[time=1328] And they begin to squeeze in really tight.
[time=1331] And they weren't excluding me at all, but you could just tell that this meant something to them.
[time=1336] And so with their arms around each other and some of them holding hands and Serega banging away on this piano, they sing a song.
[time=1344] I had no idea what the tune was. I had no idea what they were singing about.
[time=1347] But I'm telling you, my friends, in the second story of this rundown building in Ivanovo on the back part of the church property, these guys filled that room with praise.
[time=1358] It was almost deafening.
[time=1361] They sang and they sang these guys with one outfit that smelled bad, that gave everything they had to come and be there for a week.
[time=1369] They sang and they began to cry.
[time=1373] And so now they're just belting this song out with tears just streaming down their faces.
[time=1379] And I'm sitting there, I'm starting to cry, I have no idea what's going on.
[time=1383] And they get done and they hug each other and they kiss each other on the cheek and they quickly make their way back to their seat and they sit down and they look at me and Serega looks at me and he says, "We begin." I said, "Wait a minute." I said, "Hold on." I said, "Serega, you've got to tell me what just happened.
[time=1402] What was that? What song was that? What were they singing about?"
[time=1409] And I'll never forget, as long as I live, he just calmly looked me in the eye and with tears welling up again in his eyes.
[time=1418] He just put his hand on my leg and he said, "We sing song of heaven."
[time=1427] That's what he said, "We sing song of heaven." Now you teach.
[time=1434] And I'll tell you, it hit me and they sang it probably three or four other times
[time=1441] during that week after a lunch break at the conclusion of a day.
[time=1446] They would gather over in the corner and they would cry and they would sing this song, "Song of heaven," he says, "We sing." And as they would do that, I think as the week went on, it dawned on me that for them there was absolutely nothing attractive at all about this world.
[time=1463] Nothing.
[time=1466] Nothing really, when it gets right down to it, attractive about this place.
[time=1472] They possessed nothing that could in any way hold them to this earth.
[time=1478] They knew nothing of pleasure or excitement or thrill beyond the thrill of knowing
[time=1484] and loving their God, their wives, their kids, and their congregations.
[time=1491] That's it.
[time=1494] I've learned in those days with those men all over again that when your today is filled with hunger, and I mean that, when your today is filled with hunger,
[time=1505] when your today is filled with the simplicity of poverty and the realization that tomorrow will be the same, one begins to look forward to that which awaits them beyond tomorrow.
[time=1517] Now don't get me wrong, these men were not depressed with their circumstance.
[time=1523] They liked those outfits.
[time=1527] They didn't know they smelled bad, or if they did, it didn't matter.
[time=1531] They loved their churches, many of them passed their churches with congregations of six, seven people.
[time=1539] Many of them live on four, five, six hundred dollars a month.
[time=1543] Many of them are absolutely filled with joy and gratitude for the potatoes they get to throw in bad water and boil every single day of their life.
[time=1553] Don't get me wrong, these guys weren't depressed.
[time=1556] They were filled with joy.
[time=1558] It's just that their joy was not purchased.
[time=1563] Their joy was not the result of any circumstance in their life that was getting better.
[time=1569] No, their joy came from deep, deep within them.
[time=1573] It was a simple joy that came because they were saved.
[time=1579] They had been redeemed and made new.
[time=1582] And they longed for another place in another time.
[time=1588] They anticipated and had a longing for heaven because they had a proper view.
[time=1596] This would be point one, I guess, today.
[time=1598] They had a proper view of this place.
[time=1602] I think so many times you and I have a very poor view, an improper view of this place.
[time=1612] When I think about those dear men and their lives and their love for and their anticipation of heaven, I think of 1 Peter 1.
[time=1619] Would you turn there this morning?
[time=1621] Would you look at 1 Peter, the first of Peter's two letters, 1 Peter chapter 1.
[time=1627] I want you to look with me at verse 13, if you would, verse 13.
[time=1632] And as you look at 1 Peter 1, 13, I want to ask you this question this morning.
[time=1635] Let me just keep putting this, if I can, kind of at the forefront of your thinking today.
[time=1640] Do you ever wish that you possessed a deeper longing and a greater anticipation for heaven?
[time=1645] Do you ever struggle to somehow survive or exist in this world, in this day,
[time=1651] somehow with an accurate and meaningful picture of heaven in mind?
[time=1656] I want you to look with me at 1 Peter 1, 13.
[time=1659] In this verse we find great truth that helps us, I think, navigate those kinds of questions and deal with those kinds of issues.
[time=1667] It says in 1 Peter 1, 13, "Therefore prepare your minds." "Therefore prepare your minds for action," it says.
[time=1678] "Keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[time=1690] That, my friends, is a reference to eternity.
[time=1695] That, my friends, is a clear reference to that day when you and I will have the grace that is to be brought
[time=1702] to be brought to us at the revelation of Jesus Christ at the end.
[time=1707] Or he says, "You ever wish that you possessed a deeper anticipation, a greater longing for heaven?"
[time=1714] He says, "Fine, prepare your minds for action." "Keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the future." Now the language here, here's what I want you to know about that verse.
[time=1726] The language here is a metaphor, and we studied as a family two years ago, we studied 1 Peter.
[time=1731] Many of you may remember this discussion.
[time=1733] Let me remind you of how the author comes at this and how this is so clearly, in such a powerful way,
[time=1740] communicated to those in the first century who would have read this, and I want to make sure you understand
[time=1746] then how powerful it can be for us.
[time=1748] In that day, when they read, prepare your minds for action, it was used as a metaphor.
[time=1754] People in this first century context wore tunics.
[time=1758] You remember that, those people, in that day they wore, wherever they went, men, women didn't matter, they wore robes.
[time=1764] They wore these tunics.
[time=1767] And when they needed to move quickly, or when they needed to compete, or when they wanted to move with great purpose,
[time=1773] they had to pull up the tunic.
[time=1776] They had to tie up the ends of the tunic kind of up and through their belt.
[time=1780] When soldiers would go to battle, the four corners of the tunic would all be brought up through the belt.
[time=1786] So there would be no encumbrance, nothing in essence then.
[time=1789] All four corners brought up, tucked up through the belt, tied down.
[time=1794] So everything below the belt is free to move in the way that it would need to move.
[time=1800] No encumbrance, nothing holding them back.
[time=1803] Everything pulled up and in, everything tied down tightly.
[time=1809] This is exactly in the Greek when he says prepare your minds for action, they would have read, cinch up your tunics.
[time=1818] This is the picture.
[time=1820] This is the language that Peter uses as he describes our readiness then to live out our days here with freedom,
[time=1827] without any encumbrance, with an eternal anticipation.
[time=1831] The only way we get it done, he says, is to cinch it up, to tie it close.
[time=1836] How do we genuinely long for heaven while living in this culture?
[time=1840] How do we live in this world in this day without being swallowed up by it or enamored by it?
[time=1847] Peter says, pull everything in tightly.
[time=1851] Watch this.
[time=1852] Start thinking a lot.
[time=1854] This has to do with the mind.
[time=1858] Peter, when he says, "Therefore prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope."
[time=1866] What he's saying is this, my friends, please don't miss this.
[time=1869] Start thinking a lot about what really matters.
[time=1874] Stop thinking so much about and stop obsessing on and stop being consumed by what doesn't.
[time=1883] Where your mind is, where your mind dwells, what you think about constantly,
[time=1890] the energy and the effort that you give in the day to day of your life to the stuff going on.
[time=1895] He says, start thinking about what matters.
[time=1898] Stop thinking about what doesn't.
[time=1901] Cut everything out of your life and you're thinking that really in the end carries no eternal purpose.
[time=1908] Don't allow the trivial, the meaningless, superficial, worthless stuff that is readily available to all of us at any moment of any day to take up space in our minds.
[time=1921] Don't let it in.
[time=1923] He says, cinch it up, tie it down.
[time=1929] I think that's interesting and I think it's compelling and I think it's convicting.
[time=1934] And I, as always, I won't speak for you.
[time=1938] But if we try and take this and apply it in a very practical way, and what God's word is saying to you and I this morning is if we want to be a people who have an ongoing and daily anticipation and longing for heaven,
[time=1951] then we've got to be a people who mentally and emotionally are, 1 Peter 1, 13, preparing our minds for that,
[time=1960] staying sober and fixing our hope and if what that means is that we are to mentally and emotionally be so very careful with what we allow in,
[time=1971] to think about and dwell on things that truly matter and to let go of stuff and not dwell on and not be consumed with stuff that doesn't,
[time=1981] well then there's some things that come to my mind.
[time=1984] And then I just say this honestly to you, there's some things that come to my mind that can get in the way for me, TV, television, sports, shopping.
[time=1999] And then when I say shopping, don't get me wrong here.
[time=2003] I'm not talking like the feminine like shopping, like chicks and the mall and I'm not thinking so much about that.
[time=2010] But like many people, I do like to make a purchase sometimes.
[time=2014] There's things I can begin to think about, stuff I can begin to plan on.
[time=2018] There's things that begin to fill my mind on stuff I'd like to get.
[time=2022] TV, sports, shopping, homes, gossip, net worth, clothes, trips, entertainment.
[time=2030] How much time in a week do you spend thinking about, planning on, obsessing about, being consumed with TV, sports, shopping, hobbies, homes, gossip, net worth, clothes, trips, entertainment?
[time=2045] None of which are inherently in and of themselves evil, all of which can distract you and I from thinking about and engaging in and being given toward things that truly do.
[time=2058] Therefore prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2070] That's what Peter's saying, when mentally and emotionally you pull in all the loose ends and you do away with, I love this phrase, the debilitating trivialities that can so easily capture our minds.
[time=2085] When you begin to instead think about and be enthralled with what matters most, and here you go, if you're sitting in the seat this morning going okay, fine, you got me.
[time=2095] I can tend to spend too much time thinking about TV, sports, shopping, homes, gossip, net worth, clothes, trips or entertainment.
[time=2102] What do you want me to think about?
[time=2105] Well, I'd invite you to think about what's true.
[time=2110] I would invite you to think about God.
[time=2112] I would invite you to think about ways that you can express your love for God and I would invite you to think about expressing your love for others.
[time=2120] I think four weeks ago we saw God himself say that in all of life the most important things you and I could ever be given to is loving him and loving others.
[time=2131] I would invite you to instead be enthralled with serving.
[time=2144] I would invite you to look at your kids, I would invite you to look at your evenings at home, I would invite you to look at your life and all the stuff that really in the end doesn't matter.
[time=2154] You may need to deal with some things, so deal with it, but be consumed with and make a priority in your heart and mind those things that truly matter.
[time=2164] The passage says then, my friends, then and only then will you fix your hope completely on heaven.
[time=2176] It's just how it works.
[time=2179] If in your life you are completely fixed on the next deal.
[time=2184] If in your life you are enthralled with, if in your mind you are focused on, if in your mind the ends are all just kind of waving in the wind.
[time=2193] And you are given to whatever it is you might be given to, the growth of your business, this relationship that you're in.
[time=2199] If what you're given to in your mind is how to improve your home, whatever it might be, pick your subject.
[time=2205] If you're enthralled in that, that is, whatever that is, whatever you pick there, that's what you'll start putting your hope in.
[time=2212] He says if you want to live with the anticipation and longing of heaven, you and I have got to be people who, while we need to deal with those things, we cinch it all up.
[time=2222] We bring it in really tight and we place our hope in that which matters.
[time=2227] Him, loving Him, serving Him, following Him, encouraging and giving ourselves to others.
[time=2235] When that is our focus, when that is what you're given to.
[time=2238] He says right there, then you will receive the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2246] You will have a hope that is set completely, fixed completely on the grace that is to be revealed.
[time=2253] Let me just say it to you this way.
[time=2255] You want to look forward to heaven, quit looking forward to this.
[time=2259] That's what those men in Yvonnevo taught me.
[time=2262] If you want to look forward to heaven, you and I have got to stop looking forward to this.
[time=2267] The heart strings have got to be redirected.
[time=2270] Our affections and our appetites, given an aim toward Him.
[time=2275] Secondly, I think while we have a poor view of this place, I think many of us have grown up with a very poor view and an accurate picture of heaven.
[time=2285] Let me just read to you a little bit about it.
[time=2287] Can I go to Revelation 21?
[time=2289] Would you do that?
[time=2290] Turn in Revelation 21 verses 1 to 4.
[time=2293] I want you to see this.
[time=2301] In Revelation 21, then I saw John here describing what this is all going to be like, what this will actually look like.
[time=2307] John says, "Then I saw in his vision, I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven
[time=2314] and the first earth passed away and there is no longer any sea.
[time=2319] And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven, out of heaven from God,
[time=2327] made ready as a bride, adorned for her husband.
[time=2330] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men,
[time=2337] and he will dwell among them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be among them."
[time=2344] Think about that.
[time=2345] Picture that.
[time=2346] They will be his people, and God himself will be among them.
[time=2350] And he will.
[time=2351] He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will no longer be any death.
[time=2357] There will no longer be any mourning or crying or pain.
[time=2362] The first things have passed away.
[time=2367] Interesting little question for you.
[time=2369] We'll come back to it.
[time=2370] So many times we've been told from the flannel graph stories in kindergarten that there wouldn't be any crying in heaven.
[time=2378] It's interesting.
[time=2379] It says that he'll wipe away every what?
[time=2383] Dear, so somebody was, what?
[time=2387] Crying.
[time=2389] Why would somebody be crying?
[time=2392] Why would he have the need to wipe away a tear if there weren't going to be any tears?
[time=2399] Just a question we'll come back to.
[time=2401] It's week five, so you have to come back to week five for that one.
[time=2406] John 14, I love this.
[time=2407] Jesus talked into his disciples.
[time=2409] John 14, verses two to four, "In my father's house," Jesus said.
[time=2413] See, I think sometimes we have suffered from a poor view of heaven, of what the Bible really says,
[time=2420] and what it really clearly implies.
[time=2423] And I think that poor view has hurt us.
[time=2425] I think part of that poor view is that so many times people think about heaven as just some nebulous kind of spiritual, cloudy place.
[time=2435] And Jesus said, in John 14, he says, "In my father's house are many dwelling places."
[time=2441] The literal translation there is room.
[time=2445] It is a dwelling place.
[time=2446] He's talking about a physical entity, many dwelling places.
[time=2451] If it were not so, I would have told you, for I go to prepare a place for you, a literal physical place.
[time=2458] If I go and prepare a literal physical dwelling place, a room for you,
[time=2464] I will come again and receive you to myself that where I am, there you may be also.
[time=2469] And he says in verse four, "And you know the way where I am going." I think one of the great spiritual tragedies of our day is that so many believers, especially, find no joy, no thrill, no anticipation in the thought of heaven.
[time=2485] Their view of heaven is warped, and with that warped view comes staggering implications.
[time=2493] Randy Alcorn, in his book called Heaven, he cites an interview he did with a pastor,
[time=2500] not just somebody, but a pastor, pastor of a church who he did an interview with about heaven.
[time=2506] In this one chapter in the book called Heaven by Alcorn, he talks about a pastor who once confessed, and I quote, "Whenever I think about heaven, I feel depressed." Truth be told, I'd rather just cease to exist when I die.
[time=2520] When the pastor was asked why he responded this way, he said, and I quote, "I can't stand the thought of endless boredom to float around in the clouds with nothing to do, strum a harp and sing a song. It all sounds terribly dull.
[time=2535] I'd rather be annihilated than spend my forever like that."
[time=2542] And there are probably people in this room this morning who feel those very thoughts
[time=2548] have said those very things.
[time=2550] And I want to ask you, how does a Bible-believing scripture studying seminary, educated pastor develop that kind of view about heaven?
[time=2560] John Eldridge, in his book, you might want to write this down, John Eldridge in his book, The Journey of Desire.
[time=2566] In his book, The Journey of Desire says that nearly every Christian I have ever spoken with
[time=2572] about heaven has this view that eternity is a continuous unending church service
[time=2578] and a boring one at that.
[time=2581] We have settled on an image of the never-ending sing-along in the sky, one great hymn after another forever and ever, amen, and our hearts sinks forever and ever, we think.
[time=2594] That's it. That's the good news.
[time=2597] That's this place he's gone to prepare, and then we sigh, feel guilty and declare ourselves unspiritual as we lose heart and turn our affections back to the present to find whatever measure of life and satisfaction we can here.
[time=2616] Tragedy, so far from what he designed for your today and for mine.
[time=2622] Eldridge, in his book, called Heaven, cites the far side cartoon.
[time=2628] Anybody ever seen, raise your hand, you ever seen a far side cartoon?
[time=2631] I think the guy's name was Gary Larson, is that right?
[time=2634] Eldridge in his book cites the far side cartoon that depicts a man newly arrived in heaven.
[time=2640] With angel wings and a halo over his head as he sits on a cloud doing absolutely nothing
[time=2646] with no one nearby.
[time=2648] He has the expression of someone trapped on a desert island with nothing to do and the caption shows his inner thoughts down at the bottom of the page where it says, "Wish I brought a magazine." How do we get there?
[time=2665] How is it that with all that God has written here for us to see and understand so many of us still think of halo's and clouds and boredom
[time=2676] and what in the world are we going to do?
[time=2680] Bottom line is, so many of us get to places where we really, as unspiritual as it might sound,
[time=2686] truth be told, don't want to go.
[time=2690] That certainly wasn't the case with the Apostle Paul.
[time=2695] Turn in your Bibles to 2 Corinthians 5, if you would.
[time=2699] Let me just read you a couple of verses where you get the sense that there really was something there.
[time=2705] Paul understood and sensed the great joy and gift that heaven would bring.
[time=2710] For we know it says 2 Corinthians 5 verses 1 and 2, it says, "For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down referring to our physical earthly bodies, we have a building from God, a new body, a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens.
[time=2726] For indeed in this house we groan longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven."
[time=2733] And it says in verse 6, "Therefore, being always of good courage and knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord, for we walk by faith, not by sight.
[time=2743] We, verse 8, we are of good courage, I say, and prefer." Paul says to you and I today, he reminds us that in the end he would have preferred,
[time=2753] because of what he knew to be true, prefer rather to be absent from the body
[time=2759] and to be at home with the Lord.
[time=2763] It was Paul himself who used to go a few pages over to Philippians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, in Philippians 1, 23 and 24, it was Paul who said, "I want this to be your heart. I want this to be the kind of thing that would come to
[time=2781] your mind and mind when we think about our anticipation and our view and our longing for heaven." He says in Philippians 1, 23, "But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart, to be out of here, and to be with Christ."
[time=2799] For that is, I love this, very much better.
[time=2803] I looked it up this week in the Greek language, if you were looking for some kind of superlative language that would have attached to it, like the greatest amount of emphasis and the greatest amount of joy and the greatest amount of excitement, I don't know what words we use today to kind of capture all that, but in the Greek, if you were going to kind of put that into a phrase, the greatest superlative that he could have written in the Greek was very much better. That's how good it is.
[time=2836] He couldn't have written it any better, because to be with Christ, he says, would be very much better, yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary, Paul said, for your sake. You know, it was Paul, actually in one, look at Philippians 1, 21, it was Paul who said, "For me to live is Christ, and to die is what?" Say it, gain. Is that how you view it?
[time=2864] Is that what you think?
[time=2868] I mean, hypothetically, you know, if you had the choice today, or are you saying, man, I just truth be told, I just really, really, really like to be with him.
[time=2880] Look at Philippians 3, I don't think I mentioned this first hour, Philippians 3, 17 to 20.
[time=2888] Philippians 3, can I read this for you?
[time=2892] 17 to 20 here. Paul, again, by the church at Philippi, and he says in 3, he says in 3, 17, brethren, join in following my example, and observe those. See that?
[time=2908] Observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
[time=2912] For many walk of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping. Now he's sad about, about some now who have gone a different direction. He says, of whom I often told you, I'll tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is their appetite, and whose glory is their shame. People who set their minds on earthly things.
[time=2944] Now that should take you and your mind right back to 1 Peter 1, 13, up, tie it in, bring in all the loose ends, be consumed with what matters, but see,
[time=2954] they've set their minds on earthly things.
[time=2958] Those whose end is destruction, whose God is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame. For our, look at this verse 20, for our citizenship, he uses an amazing word there in the Greek that talks about the central place, the central most dominant location of home, where everything is tied back to, a place, a central location that evidences our citizenship, that evidence is where we truly be long. He says our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2998] See, Paul knows something here. I think the scriptures are filled with truth that I wish that pastor would have had a better understanding of. I wish the cartoons depicted more of this because what is it that Paul knew?
[time=3014] Here you go. He couldn't wait. Paul couldn't wait to be with the Lord. He couldn't wait for a perfectly restored life with a perfectly resurrected Christ in a perfectly redeemed body on an earth that will be thoroughly and completely made new, an earth that will be in the end filled with perfect people, in perfect relationship with God and each other, and enjoying all of God's glory together. That's what he understood, and that's what he looked forward to. You see, the pastor had been fed a really poor picture of heaven. And sadly, many of us in the room have for years shared that same picture. So I want to with you in the days to come ask these questions.
[time=3066] I want to help you. I am being helped myself. I want there to develop in your mind and in my heart and in this collective body. I want there, and I'm praying that in the days to come, there would be a better view, a clearer picture of not what I surmised, but what God's word actually says. You have to understand.
[time=3086] I went to seminary. I don't understand this. Today looking back, I shake my head. I went to seminary where they train men to do this. And I remember being in seminary classrooms where guys would ask scholarly professors who had studied that for years, questions about heaven, and rarely could you get a clear answer. So many times what I grew up hearing, so many times what I heard, even at the highest level of education was basically we're not really sure. Hard to say.
[time=3122] We'll find out when we what, when we get there.
[time=3126] And I'm sorry. I think that diminishes.
[time=3130] I think that forts. I think that stifles.
[time=3134] Not only your understanding, but your anticipation for something that I think Scripture gives you a whole lot more clarity on than we ever knew was there. So here are some questions we're going to ask in the days to come. What is heaven really, what is heaven really going to be like? I mean let's talk about, let's open up the scriptures and let's try our best to the degree that we can to paint a picture of what it's really going to be like.
[time=3162] I wrote a few others down. What's the difference between heaven and the new earth? This is a really fascinating discussion.
[time=3170] You know what? This is a discussion that some of you in the room have had. Others of you in the room I bet haven't had. And here's what I mean.
[time=3182] When we oftentimes in our just kind of blow it off we'll find out more about it when we get their approach. We oftentimes just think of life after death and the believer. We just think about heaven. It's okay. I understand that. And the scripture is really, really clear that at the moment you and I physically die, if we know the Lord, if we fully surrendered our hearts and lives to Him, the scriptures are absolutely clear that at the moment you die physically you are spiritually in the presence of who? The Lord. In a place called what?
[time=3218] Say it. Heaven. Right. Now the scriptures are I think very clear that at that moment of physical death there is a separation of body and soul and that for that time period we are with Him in soul and in spirit.
[time=3234] I know that sounds a little nebulous. We'll talk more about that.
[time=3238] Please trust me. The more I've studied in red I don't think that's a bad gig. I think that's still good. I think although we want the physical body and the redeemed body and that's coming we are going to be with Him and you're going to know it and you're going to sense it and He's going to know it and we're going to be with Him in the presence of God in a place called heaven if we know Him. Now there will come a time when God will determine, okay heaven, right? There will be a time that God will determine when this whole thing is going to come to an end.
[time=3270] Do you agree with that? There will be a time when the Lord comes back there will be a thousand year reign and there will be the final judgment at the great white throne when God and His sovereignty decides that enough is enough and He's going to end the thing and Satan and all of those who rejected the Lord will finally once and for all. The seas will give them up, it says.
[time=3294] Hades will give them up and all will be judged and God will do away with them and then what I read to you earlier from Revelation 21 kicks in. Then all of a sudden we get this thing called a new earth.
[time=3310] The old earth passes away and the new Jerusalem comes out of the sky from the heavens and the new Jerusalem comes and we then at the end of this thing with redeemed bodies and a redeemed resurrected Lord and redeemed relationships and a redeemed and restored earth. See we think, now we do it on time, we think, okay sorry I always thought the earth was gone because I always got told as the little boy it was all going to what?
[time=3342] Burn up. Well I think it can burn up, I think it can be destroyed but I don't think that means that I'm relegated to a cloud and the scriptures are so very clear. You look at 2 Peter 2 Peter 3, 10 I think is where most of us get that notion 2 Peter 3, 10 but the day of the Lord will come like a thief in which the heaven will pass in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat and the earth and its works will be burned up.
[time=3374] See that? Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct in godliness. I believe that this present earth will burn. I believe a day will come when he will as we know it wipe it out. It will be destroyed with intense heat.
[time=3398] The Bible says he'll then make it new.
[time=3402] The Bible says and we'll look at this in the days to come that he will redeem that earth. It's the beauty of God.
[time=3410] I mean really when you think about it it shouldn't be any other way that in the end this broken messed up faulty cracked earth that isn't at all today what he originally designed it to be it get you and I got restored you and I got redeemed the scriptures teach the earth will be redeemed and there will be a day when we dwell on it a new earth with a new capital for worship called the new Jerusalem and it is going to be an amazing thing. We'll look at that in great detail. What will we do in heaven besides sing? Who will we know?
[time=3450] Well we know our friends what we know and recognize our family. What is the new Jerusalem? What will take place there? One week we'll talk about how should the reality of heaven? How should the reality of what we'll learn about and see in this study? How should the reality of heaven affect the way you live today?
[time=3466] Lastly the very last week we're going to ask one last question having studied all of that having looked at all of that the last week we'll talk about who goes?
[time=3482] Who goes to heaven?
[time=3508] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
