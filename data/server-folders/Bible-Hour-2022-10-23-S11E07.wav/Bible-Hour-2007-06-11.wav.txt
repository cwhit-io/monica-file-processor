[time=381] $1 for a minivan? It is kind of Steve. Can't talk my wife into one of these expeditions, so I guess this is the day I go over the hill.
[time=391] Well, if it's any encouragement, it is the best minivan on the market. Larry, I'm doing backflips.
[time=396] I'm going to need to see your driver's license. And we're going to need your wife's signature as well.
[time=402] She'll be right out. She had to run to the restaurant. Okay.
[time=407] So, you have kids? Three. Three? Boy. Girl. Boy. You?
[time=417] My wife just took home a self-regnancy test the other night. And?
[time=421] Houston, we have liftoff. Congratulations, Larry.
[time=426] Yeah, we're going out tonight to celebrate. Oh, great.
[time=430] Dad, mom says she's not coming out if you're going to debate her about it.
[time=433] Would you tell her I need her signature? I want to look at the cars. Tell her.
[time=438] Then look at cars and check out that yellow convertible over there. Fine.
[time=444] He's my oldest. Great kid, but I'm telling you, puberty was like riding a bucking bronco.
[time=450] I'd love to have a son someday. Well, girls tend to be more compliant.
[time=455] Dad, is Kyle in here? No, Brenna. He was your responsibility.
[time=460] I know. The little rat's hiding from me. I'm going to pull out all of his finger nails.
[time=467] Girls also have their moments. Yeah, I can see why you need the minivan.
[time=473] Yeah. See, they'll have a choke collars.
[time=478] By the way, those minivans of yours don't come with the canine patrol option, do they?
[time=482] The canine patrol option? Yeah, you know, that little screen between the front and the back seats.
[time=487] Oh, tell me, Larry, that is an option that would make money.
[time=491] Dad, can I have a dollar? Where have you been? I was out there.
[time=495] You know, your sister's been looking for you. She's blind. I was out there the whole time.
[time=500] What's this for? I want to get some candy. It's 830. No chocolate. Thanks, Dad.
[time=508] Dad, Mom's still not coming out. Tell her I won't debate her anymore. Dad, go.
[time=516] And you wanted the back seat to be a bench seat, right?
[time=525] You know, Larry, I really don't care. All I need is room for six. It'll seat eight.
[time=530] Don't you have a family of five? Five and three quarters.
[time=535] Gail, this is Larry the Finance Guy. Hi, Larry the Finance Guy.
[time=540] I can see why you need the space. Gee, thanks a lot.
[time=543] I'm you for the baby. How's he been complaining to you about getting a minivan?
[time=547] Brother, I don't want you hanging out in the waiting room. Where's Kyle?
[time=551] In there. Can you be a suitcase?
[time=556] Kyle, get out of the truck.
[time=562] Did you buy it yet? No, I've been waiting for your mother. I want to go. Sit down.
[time=569] Why can't I watch TV? Because you are too beautiful and intelligent to waste your time sitting in front of that box.
[time=576] David, were you cut that out? Larry the Finance Guy is going to think we live in a barn.
[time=582] No. Thank you, young man. Where did you get this anyway?
[time=587] I bought it. With what? My own money.
[time=592] Liar? I'm sorry.
[time=596] What's for me to look at? Can I have another dollar?
[time=600] I think one is enough. Mom, can I have a dollar?
[time=603] It doesn't mean go ask your mother. But David stole the last one.
[time=609] You are so grounded, young man. You are so dead.
[time=613] Sit down. Where were we?
[time=618] We were standing on the brink and there's no turning back.
[time=623] Here we go. My life is flashing before my eyes.
[time=630] It's not pretty. I thought you said you were done debating.
[time=634] I'm not debating. I'm appealing to your sense of humanity.
[time=639] Come on, honey. Come with me to the showroom.
[time=642] Please, they have cars, nice lines and curves. It doesn't have to be a mustang.
[time=648] I'll settle for a 500. You don't have to drive it. If you don't want to.
[time=654] But it could be 20 years before we get a new car again.
[time=657] Come on, minivans the only option. Put the NSUV!
[time=660] Too expensive. Helen, you're married. You have 3.9 children.
[time=664] Don't rub it in.
[time=669] Why are you doing this? We have already decided on the minivan.
[time=674] No. I know. But I'm warning you, what are these days?
[time=679] I'm going to pull into the driveway in a nice convertible.
[time=683] Just so long as it doesn't include a nice little redhead to go with it.
[time=687] Dad, cars ran on the side of a car with the chocolate bar.
[time=691] What? Kyle? Kyle, get that off of there.
[time=694] Don't lick it off. Cry it out loud. I live with the iguana family.
[time=700] I'm so sorry. Can we just finish this?
[time=703] Yes. I just need you to sign here and then initial here and here.
[time=710] You're witnessing the top of Alan Brenner's head as it goes over the crest of the hill.
[time=723] Today I become an automobile eunuch. Don't be so traumatic.
[time=728] What's a unit? Never mind.
[time=732] So what color did you want? Pink. Do you have pink because that would just be like the top of the day here?
[time=739] No pink, but we do have black, blue, pink. That'd be appropriate. Black and blue, can you mix the two?
[time=746] Aspen, green, salsa, red, peel, red, black, blue, fuchsia, why not?
[time=755] Hey, where's Kyle? Alan Brenner?
[time=762] Kyle! Don't worry, Larry, it's not always like this.
[time=773] It does seem a bit busy. Oh, it's busy, all right?
[time=776] Sometimes it's completely out of control. I think I'm going to go crazy.
[time=779] Trying to figure out how I'm going to pay for everything and what the next emergency is.
[time=784] Did you always plan on having four kids?
[time=787] Well, yeah, just not all this craziness, but you can't take 'em back, can you?
[time=795] Dad, a minivan with a TV in it!
[time=800] Really?
[time=804] You know, Larry, I wouldn't trade this for the world. I'll be right back.
[time=813] Hey, honey, yeah.
[time=816] Yeah, I know, I'm sorry, this last customer's going to take a little longer than I thought.
[time=821] Yeah, that's fine with me, I'm sorry. Is trainees okay?
[time=826] Yeah, and I'll stop on the way home, too, and pick up another home pregnancy test.
[time=830] The air-proof ones? Yeah, just to be sure.
[time=838] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Black Hawk Ministries, and we want to thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=844] You're not going to see Kelly this week, he's in Nairobi, Kenya, working with a leadership team at an orphanage
[time=850] to create a relationship so we can take teams from Fort Wayne to Nairobi, Kenya,
[time=856] and invest in the lives of children, many of whom have done all kinds of things happen to them,
[time=863] some with the HIV virus and others who just been abandoned, hundreds of kids are abandoned on a periodic basis in dumps,
[time=873] and it's just a sad situation, but one where we hope to shine the light of Christ and bring hope to that situation.
[time=882] So that's why we're hitting the pause button on the Heaven series, and you're going to see today quite an interesting interview,
[time=889] I think, a story that maybe someday, I think, will be a movie about forgiveness,
[time=895] and it's an amazing journey, so you might want to grab that cup of coffee or that hot chocolate, or even a diet Pepsi,
[time=901] and sit down and join us, and listen to this, and just ask your own heart,
[time=907] "Do I let go or do I hold on when sins are committed against me?" Because to forgive me is the let go, and there's a freedom that comes with that.
[time=917] Otherwise, when I hold on, I'm imprisoned, and Jesus taught this in a parable which you'll hear.
[time=922] Thank you so much for joining us, Kelly will be back next week to share.
[time=926] I'm sure some of his travels and also resume this series on Heaven.
[time=930] Join us any Sunday morning at 9 a.m. and 1045, also on Wednesday nights at Common Ground, 645 to 815,
[time=937] for a completely different and separate worship service, so we'd love for you to join us for that as well.
[time=944] Thank you so much for joining us for the Bible Hour, and have a great week.
[time=974] It's on Heaven's mercy scene.
[time=983] Where is the end of what's there?
[time=992] I'm only holding the scene.
[time=1000] Sing a new song, dear sits on Heaven's mercy.
[time=1015] We hold the only song, Lord God Almighty, who has the place to come.
[time=1031] We hold the place to match the great to the King.
[time=1039] We hold the place to you all by every day, and not well before you.
[time=1064] Lord, the rainbows of living color, flashes of lightning, walls of thunder.
[time=1079] Let's sing it under strength and glory and power be to you the only one screen.
[time=1093] Yeah, Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who finds the place to come.
[time=1109] Yeah, we hold the place to match the great to the King of Kings.
[time=1120] You are my enemy, and I'm real of talking.
[time=1144] Fill with wonder, awestruck and wonder.
[time=1152] At the mention of your name.
[time=1159] Jesus, your name is power.
[time=1164] Read the living water, search of all this mystery.
[time=1175] Yeah, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who finds the place to come.
[time=1189] Yeah, we hold the place to match the great to the King of Kings.
[time=1200] You are not an enemy, and I'm real of talking.
[time=1208] Yeah, we hold the Holy, Holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was in this indeed to come.
[time=1223] With all creation I've seen, praise to the King of Kings.
[time=1232] You are my enemy, and I'm real, but talking.
[time=1241] Yeah, we hold the place to match the great to the King of Kings.
[time=1248] You are my enemy, and I'm real of talking.
[time=1278] Good Friday, we had the opportunity in a service here to teach on the parable of the unforgiving
[time=1291] debtor.
[time=1292] Jesus was asked, "How many times should I forgive somebody who sends against me?
[time=1297] How about seven?" And Jesus replied, "Not seven, but seventy times seven or seventy seven times." Which was hyperbole for we are called to let go the definition of forgiveness.
[time=1308] We are called to let go rather than hold on every time there is an offense.
[time=1314] And Jesus said, "Here, I'm going to tell you a story so you kind of get it." Jesus said, "Seeing one of the story, a servant owes a king ten thousand talents.
[time=1325] He owes him the biggest debt ever incurred that anybody's ever heard of.
[time=1330] A talent was fifteen years' wages, so ten thousand talents is a hundred and fifty thousand years' wages."
[time=1336] I call this the vertical.
[time=1338] The servant owes vertically to the king who is above him the biggest debt ever incurred by anyone.
[time=1347] Vertical up and down, servant to the king, the king in the parable of his imagery, forgot.
[time=1353] "My sin, your sin against a holy God, is the biggest debt that anyone has ever incurred."
[time=1361] Well, the servant begs the king to let him go after he said, "I'll pay it back."
[time=1369] And that's kind of what we do with God.
[time=1370] I'll do it with religious good works.
[time=1372] I'll pay it back.
[time=1373] But the king self-insures, pays the debt unless the servant goes.
[time=1378] Scene two is the horizontal, servant to servant.
[time=1384] Vertical was the servant to the king, us to God.
[time=1389] And horizontal is servant to servant, relationships with other people.
[time=1394] Here's the big kicker.
[time=1396] What is owed between the two servants is a hundred denieri, a hundred days' wages.
[time=1402] So the servant who was just forgiven, the biggest debt ever incurred, a hundred and fifty thousand years' wages, bumps into a guy who owes him a hundred days' wages.
[time=1411] And he says, "Pay me back." He choked him, he said, "Pay me back." Servant says the same thing that the first servant told the king, "I'll pay you back, be patient with me." But instead, the servant who had just been forgiven, the biggest debt ever incurred,
[time=1428] demands that the guy who owes him a hundred days' wages be put in prison until he can pay it back.
[time=1433] He holds on.
[time=1435] Third scene, holding on to a horizontal debt leads to imprisonment.
[time=1442] And the one who's imprisoned is the withholder, not the offender.
[time=1448] See what Jesus is saying here is that no matter what happens to you, horizontal in relationships, person to person, no matter against the law, no matter how heinous,
[time=1458] no matter how bad it is, or how bad it hurt, it does not compare to the weight, to the debt of our sin against the Holy God.
[time=1467] And all sins are paid where the vertical meets the horizontal at the cross of Jesus Christ,
[time=1473] reconciling man with God vertically and man with man horizontally.
[time=1479] Well in scene three, the servant holds on and he's put in prison and Jesus concludes it this way.
[time=1485] He says, it's the most sobering verse I think in all the scripture.
[time=1488] He says, "This is how my heavenly Father will treat you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.
[time=1494] Your heart is your will, your emotions, your mind, and your spirit.
[time=1499] Your will, that means you choose to.
[time=1501] Your emotions, that means you want to, you'll feel like it.
[time=1505] Your mind, that means you'll think to, and your spirit, which means you'll pray to.
[time=1512] What happens when we separate the vertical from the horizontal, we build four prison walls.
[time=1516] And the irony is the one incarcerated inside those four walls is not the offender, like we think it is, it's the withholder.
[time=1525] It's we are the ones inside the four walls when we refuse to forgive.
[time=1529] And there are four prison walls I think of withholding forgiveness, of unforgiveness.
[time=1533] The first one is revenge. It sort of leads with the will.
[time=1536] The Bible teaches us clearly, let go of revenge.
[time=1539] In fact, it's in the context of the greatest horizontal commandment to love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1544] It says, don't hold on to revenge.
[time=1547] But love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1549] Let go of revenge.
[time=1550] It kind of leads with the will.
[time=1552] I choose to take control of the situation.
[time=1554] We have resentment, which literally means to feel it again and again again.
[time=1557] It leads with the emotions.
[time=1558] It includes all four chambers of the spiritual heart, but it leads with the emotions.
[time=1563] I'm going to feel it again and again.
[time=1565] Paul's really clear in Ephesians 431 and 32.
[time=1568] Let go of all bitterness, all resentment, because you've been forgiven vertically, the biggest debt ever incurred by mankind.
[time=1575] So let go of the comparatively smaller debts horizontally.
[time=1579] Regret.
[time=1580] Regret is literally the thought that I could change the past.
[time=1583] I could have, I would have, I should have.
[time=1585] If I had just done something, they wouldn't have sinned against me.
[time=1588] It's usually how it goes.
[time=1589] And we tend to operate through fear and protection.
[time=1594] And it's all centered in pride.
[time=1596] And we need to turn.
[time=1597] We need to repent.
[time=1598] Do a 180 and leave the fear and trust God.
[time=1602] Leave the protection and learn.
[time=1604] It's a 180.
[time=1605] It's repentance.
[time=1607] The final one is resisting blessing.
[time=1610] It leads with the spirit.
[time=1612] It means I will not wish someone well before God and well before others.
[time=1616] I just won't do it.
[time=1618] Kind of the goal of forgiveness is to eventually lead to reconciliation.
[time=1623] Forgiveness always precedes reconciliation.
[time=1626] Reconciliation does not always follow forgiveness because forgiveness takes too.
[time=1631] Forgiveness is the only concept that wells together two ideas.
[time=1634] Justice and mercy because God is fully just and God is fully merciful.
[time=1638] And all sin is paid in full at the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=1642] And as we said earlier, it flows from the very heart of God.
[time=1646] And the whole idea is that we would be free.
[time=1649] That we would be forgiven of this big debt and we would go live in freedom by letting go of the smaller debts horizontally.
[time=1656] Well, what I'd like to do today is walk you through one of the most amazing stories I've ever heard in my life.
[time=1661] And I brought a friend with me today where he's going to walk through the pieces of this parable into a real life story of how it took place.
[time=1669] So could you please give a warm Black Hawk welcome to Arnie Placencia.
[time=1679] Arnie, it's Father's Day.
[time=1683] Why don't you just tell everybody a little bit about your dad where he came from and how he got here.
[time=1689] There's my papa.
[time=1691] Dad is born in Rosita, Mexico.
[time=1694] And my mother was born in Yvali, Texas.
[time=1700] Dad was kind of a, basically he was a cowboy.
[time=1704] And he courted my mother.
[time=1706] He would ride his horse across the Rio Grande.
[time=1709] And my mom told her that he owned a big ranch and he didn't.
[time=1714] They were married and the dad was a hard worker.
[time=1719] He's a hard worker.
[time=1720] He loved to sing, loved to dance, liked sports, boxing, wrestling.
[time=1726] But anyway, he migrated to the United States and became a citizen in 1943.
[time=1733] He did a lot of construction and worked in the gas line and come up to Indiana.
[time=1737] He's also a gardener and he loved the Indiana soil.
[time=1741] And so he decided to make his home here.
[time=1745] He's also very stern.
[time=1750] I got a lot of spankons.
[time=1752] I got a lot of them when I deserved it and I got quite a few when I did deserve it.
[time=1756] And he also had a problem with, he liked your drink.
[time=1762] He was a womanizer.
[time=1765] And that's kind of what I remember about my dad.
[time=1770] And your dad meets up with my grandfather years ago when he moved to the area.
[time=1777] My grandfather was a boxer.
[time=1779] Your dad had 13 children.
[time=1781] How many boys again?
[time=1782] Seven boys, each one, a Golden Gloves champion.
[time=1786] Arnie is five-time Golden Gloves champion.
[time=1789] He's one of the greatest athletes ever to come out of DeKalb County.
[time=1793] He's been stories written about him.
[time=1795] And Arnie and his brother Ed had a boxing school that I attended for a few days and realized that I did not want a box.
[time=1804] My dad was a boxer.
[time=1805] They had pushed that on me and there's just been this warm connection and weaving together of our stories.
[time=1811] I have coach Logan, Arnie's daughter, and basketball.
[time=1814] And I now have the privilege of coaching Jordan in basketball.
[time=1818] And we expect greatness from Jordan, which is quite an athlete.
[time=1821] So this is how our lives have been woven together.
[time=1824] Arnie owns a restaurant in Auburn called Pancho Kelly.
[time=1828] Pancho is a nickname for his dad who's loved in the community.
[time=1832] And Kelly is Arnie's wife who's here with us today as well.
[time=1837] Today, I want to share with you Arnie's story.
[time=1842] And the first part of it is I want to talk about Arnie's journey to Christ.
[time=1846] Now, Arnie, you were a tough guy.
[time=1848] You were a street fighter.
[time=1849] You were a Golden Gloves champion.
[time=1851] But in your late teens, early twenties, you started getting into trouble.
[time=1854] And one night, you made kind of a foolish choice.
[time=1857] And you want to tell everybody about that?
[time=1859] It was a real stupid choice.
[time=1861] After mom and dad were divorced, they kind of didn't have any.
[time=1866] But they watched me at all as far as because mom worked factories, worked in the fields.
[time=1871] And so I started running around quite a bit.
[time=1873] Started to dab in new drugs and alcohol and this way where I get my hands on.
[time=1878] Resented my father a lot for hurting my mother numerous times.
[time=1884] And I got to the point of my life by 1971 where I didn't really like life.
[time=1895] And so I would do stuff that probably most people wouldn't do because I wasn't afraid of the consequences of what I do.
[time=1903] I wasn't afraid of dying because I didn't enjoy living.
[time=1907] And one night when I was with a friend of mine or some friends, we were in Fort Wayne and we were stoned and drunk.
[time=1917] And somebody made a suggestion of what do you want to do next?
[time=1921] And somebody says, "Well, let's go fire bomb a house.
[time=1925] You know how to make fire bombs, aren't you?" I go, "Yeah, yeah, I'm going to do that." So whose house were you going to pick?
[time=1933] Well, my friend had had just done three years.
[time=1937] I had peddled a reformatory for stealing a car.
[time=1940] I got away, he did not.
[time=1942] You helped him steal a car?
[time=1943] I helped a steal a car.
[time=1945] And so he suggests, "Well, let's go fire bomb that prosecutors house." So here's his three stupid guys.
[time=1953] 19 years old.
[time=1955] We go.
[time=1956] In front of this house, we gear it in Vienna, and my friend throws his fire bomb through the front-day window of his home.
[time=1966] And I praise God.
[time=1975] I've experienced many miracles, and this thing breaks, goes through the window, does not burn.
[time=1982] I had mine in my hand, and it must have been my Catholicism upbringing some of it took.
[time=1988] Because I could not throw that fire bomb at the house, and my friend screaming, "Burn him!"
[time=1995] And I threw it down and blew us both across the lawn, but consequently we were still in deep trouble.
[time=2002] Because we had thrown one inside the house, and seemed though it didn't ignite.
[time=2007] We took off, we were caught out west by a posse.
[time=2013] It was really a posse, and they caught us, and they brought us back in shackles.
[time=2018] And this one sheriff told me, he says, "Boy, you're in deep trouble." And I knew what he was talking about, and come back, and consequently jailed, and they killed a county jail in Auburn, Indiana.
[time=2033] I had been there a few times before.
[time=2035] And there were always these men that would come in on the weekends, and I always thought they were crazy.
[time=2042] And they carried Bibles, they were the Gideon's, and they tell you about Jesus, and try to talk into accepting Christ as your Savior.
[time=2051] And all I knew was my background, and I sincerely believed that there was only one church that existed, and that was the Catholic Church.
[time=2060] But nobody ever told me about accepting Christ as my Savior, receiving a new life in Christ.
[time=2067] And so I didn't believe these guys, I just figured they were a bunch of con men.
[time=2072] Some guys would accept Christ, and I would mock them.
[time=2075] And I told this guy, it's kind of a challenge, I think, because I like challenges.
[time=2079] I said, "I could do that, I could act like I'm a Christian, that's what these guys are doing, only they're getting paid, I'm a jail, and I'm not."
[time=2087] So I called a man named Paul Brown up, one of the Gideon's, and told him I wanted to talk to him.
[time=2094] And I told him that my buddy Rick and I decided to accept Christ as our Lord and Savior.
[time=2100] So Paul is, you know, how many of you would be? Paul is, he's crying.
[time=2105] Well, he just down Romans road, and we accept Christ.
[time=2108] They even remember getting some spit and putting it on my face.
[time=2110] So, look like I had been crying.
[time=2112] You're faking the whole thing.
[time=2114] So, I go back out, the Gideon's calm.
[time=2118] Each time they leave, I'm laughing, but to show them that this guy that they're talking about was not real.
[time=2124] Nobody can have a personal relationship with Christ.
[time=2127] That didn't exist.
[time=2129] And so, but to play the game, I started learning Scripture.
[time=2135] And started learning Romans 3, 23, 6, 23, 2 Corinthians 5, 17.
[time=2143] And that's about where it stopped, because I didn't know about the sword of the Spirit.
[time=2148] And I learned those scriptures, and I'd recite them to the Gideon's and the praise of the Lord.
[time=2154] And they'd leave, I'd laugh.
[time=2157] And on the third week, I was in jail, and I was asleep, and still haven't gone to court yet for my crime.
[time=2167] And I was awakened in the middle of the night, heard somebody out walking around and walked out there, and there was nobody there.
[time=2175] And I could feel someone there, didn't know how to respond to someone that was not there.
[time=2181] And I ran back to my little place of refuge, which was my jail cell.
[time=2186] And I see this Gideon Bible sitting on my bars, and it was my little front.
[time=2191] And the street light was shining down on it, and I just became enraged.
[time=2196] I started tearing this little Gideon Bible up that I had for a prop.
[time=2201] And that was the moment that the Word of God that switched from my mind started going on into my heart.
[time=2212] And I realized that I could hear myself reciting the scriptures that God did indeed love me.
[time=2220] And he would give me a new life if I accept him as my Savior.
[time=2229] And I knelt down, and I cried, and I accepted Christ as my Savior alone in the jail cell.
[time=2235] And I don't know how long I cried.
[time=2237] I got myself asleep.
[time=2238] I woke up the next day, and I started doing things, but the difference was I started feeling bad when I would do something bad.
[time=2246] I would start feeling bad.
[time=2248] And I realized I go back to my jail cell, and I see the Gideon Bible tour.
[time=2253] And I go, "Oh my gosh, I accepted you as my Lord and Savior." And I didn't know what to do. I was confused.
[time=2260] My buddy noticed it, and so we're talking late at night, and he goes, "Man, what's wrong?" And I go, "So I'm really hesitant." And I go, "I think what those Gideon's are talking about is really true." He looks at me, he goes, "You do?" I go, "Yeah, I think what they're saying about Jesus is that he will give you a new life.
[time=2281] If you accept him as your Savior, he will forgive you for everything." He goes, "You do?" And so I go, "Yeah, as a matter of fact, I stopped." I said, "I accepted him as my Savior last night." And in his jailhouse response, he goes, "Damn, so did I."
[time=2302] And I go, "You did?" He goes, "Yeah." And I go, "What are we going to do?" He goes, "I don't know." Well, let's call the Gideon back.
[time=2314] So we call Paul Brown, and we share with him about how bad we were, and we'd be kind to him, and Paul just smiles.
[time=2322] This little tear coming down his face. He goes, "I know you guys are kind to me." "Why didn't you say anything, Paul?" And he said, "Whatever would take you to read scripture was fine with me.
[time=2333] You can fine with God." And I knew that he would deal with you someday.
[time=2338] So now that the dilemma was convincing the guys that I was in jail with, that I was really saved, so it was my first experience that little missionary thing.
[time=2351] And so I witness to the guys I was in jail with.
[time=2355] It was eventually sent to five years in prison.
[time=2360] So I shared my testimony in court.
[time=2364] The prosecutor reboddled it. I shared it again.
[time=2367] Wasn't going to let it go.
[time=2370] And then one night when I got sent to Pendleton in reformatory,
[time=2376] and I was asleep one night, and I'd only been there for about six months, and I had a dream that I was in front of a crowd of youth.
[time=2387] And I was up on a stage, and I was telling them about how Christ had come into my life,
[time=2393] and I accepted him as my savior.
[time=2395] And I woke up and I'm like, "Wow, that was cool." And then I have a sense in my heart and in my mind that I'm supposed to do that.
[time=2405] And so I got in my mind that I'm supposed to get out of prison.
[time=2410] Well, doesn't everybody think I'm supposed to get out of prison?
[time=2412] So I go to my counselor and I tell him this dream, and he looks at me like, "I'm crazy." But he gives me a procedure. I follow it. Nothing happens.
[time=2422] Finally says one day, "Arnie, you fire bomb the prosecutor attorney's house.
[time=2428] You got your breaking court. You're going to be here for five years.
[time=2433] I don't care who wants you out." The warden said, "You cannot leave for five years." If he doesn't want you out, God's not going to get you out.
[time=2443] So I ran back to myself, and I prayed, and I was mentored by the Gideon's.
[time=2448] They would come to see me about every week, and they taught me to pray, to give thanks no matter what happened.
[time=2454] And so I did, but I wanted assurance that God had called me out.
[time=2459] So I wrote a letter to the warden, and this guard befriended me as a Christian man, a nice guy, a nice old dude, and I asked me if he would smuggle this letter out for me.
[time=2469] He goes, "Arnie, that's against the law." I go, "I know, I go a bit." And I told him what happened. He goes, "Okay, I'll do it." Some sat in the meba, the next night, this is the next night, and read into my Bible.
[time=2486] And I hadn't been called by my name for about a year then, and they always collaborated by your number, and I heard somebody go, "Mr. Placencia." So I look up, and there's this guard standing there.
[time=2498] He goes, "Are you Mr. Placencia?" I go, "Yes, I am, sir." I'm thinking, "Why did this guy call me by my name?" He says, "I worked here for 30 years." This was on a Sunday night.
[time=2509] He says, "I've never, ever, ever seen anyone leave this place."
[time=2515] Praise God, leave his place on a Sunday.
[time=2522] And he says, "I got a note from the warden." And he said, "This man is supposed to leave today." Pack your stuff, he goes, "You're going home." God wanted you out.
[time=2532] Went me out, right now.
[time=2534] So my cell partner, I had to witness to him, and he's like, "Praise the Lord, man.
[time=2539] Everything even tell us about you going home is true." And he says, "Well, praise the Lord." And he goes, "Wow." And so the guard says, "Get your stuff.
[time=2547] I got my letters and my Bible." And I said, "Can I have five minutes just to do something?" He goes, "You're going home and you want five minutes to do what?" I go, "I've got to go tell my friends.
[time=2559] I've been telling them about God.
[time=2561] It called me out of prison." And so here's this little Mexican guy running back and forth.
[time=2566] There's three tiers of prisons or cells.
[time=2570] And I'm running all these guys.
[time=2572] These guys are looking back and forth because everybody's locked up and they call me Migo, Migo.
[time=2578] Migo, what you doing?
[time=2579] And I'm running back and forth.
[time=2580] And I'm telling everybody that God has called me out of prison.
[time=2583] One of the guys fell in his knees and accepted Christ as a savior when I showed him my past to go home.
[time=2589] So I was on my way to California.
[time=2596] Had a brother Ray.
[time=2598] It was 19.
[time=2600] And I went to him via letters and stuff.
[time=2603] And he was a really, really neat brother.
[time=2605] And I was going to California as far as I was actually paroled to.
[time=2610] Brother Ray, before I went, he went to church.
[time=2615] And he had accepted Christ as a savior.
[time=2618] Well, he wanted to hang with me because of his new faith.
[time=2622] So he goes out to California to wait for me to get there.
[time=2625] And he was killed in an auto accident.
[time=2628] And I remember getting the phone call.
[time=2630] And that was a challenge.
[time=2633] And I remember how I was mentored.
[time=2636] And I gave praise to God.
[time=2638] And I thanked God for my brother's life.
[time=2641] And I said, "God, I don't know how you can use this death, but if you can't use it." And it was within the week, of course, we had the funeral.
[time=2651] And the family's there.
[time=2653] And I'm trying to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit.
[time=2656] And I'm sure in what I can.
[time=2658] I take my dad for a ride to the mile corner to pick something up.
[time=2662] Probably some smokes or something.
[time=2664] And on the way there, I started hearing the sound.
[time=2669] And I looked at my father sobbing.
[time=2672] I had never seen my dad cry.
[time=2674] He was the tough guy.
[time=2676] And I go, "Dad, what's wrong?" And he reached over and grabbed my hand.
[time=2680] And he started crying and saying that he had been a horrible father to all you kids.
[time=2688] And now my son Ray is dead.
[time=2689] And I can never tell him I'm sorry.
[time=2691] And I can never be forgiven.
[time=2694] And I shared with him about how I shared Christ with Ray.
[time=2697] And Ray had accepted Christ as a savior.
[time=2700] No matter what you'd ever done in your life, Dad, if you give it to God and accepted Christ as your savior, that he would forgive you of anything.
[time=2710] That Ray was in heaven with Christ.
[time=2713] That's where he's going to spend eternity.
[time=2715] And that God would forgive him too.
[time=2718] And he would spend eternity with him as well.
[time=2724] He said, "I would like to do that if I could." And he didn't quite understand.
[time=2728] So that weekend I took him to church here in Fort Wayne.
[time=2732] And that was a great message.
[time=2735] And my father stood up and accepted Christ as a savior.
[time=2739] Went to church to me next Sunday, accepted Christ again.
[time=2742] And I said, "Dad, you know what it takes once?" He goes, "Well, I want to be sure. I don't know. I'm sure." So my dad just started transforming from this wild guy
[time=2754] to the picture that you saw on the screen.
[time=2757] And you can see the picture.
[time=2759] And he just transformed just like that.
[time=2761] And so I was a paramedic in Fort Wayne and I would go see Dad and talk to him about stuff.
[time=2767] And he would say something about his truck or something happened.
[time=2770] And I go, "Dad, you know, just pray about it. That's what you do." He goes about my truck.
[time=2775] "Oh, yeah, pray about anything, Dad." And the guy wants to talk to him.
[time=2780] He goes, "Well, you know, I do Sunday." He goes, "But I can't speak in very good English." And so I run out of stuff to say.
[time=2787] And I go, "Well, talk to him in Spanish." And he goes, "No." He goes.
[time=2793] And I go, "What, Papa?" And he goes, "God understands Spanish?" I go, "Yes, Dad. God understands Spanish." "No. I understand everything I say." "Dad, he will understand everything he says in Spanish." "Oh, this is me. Oh, my God." He says, "I will pray for all the time." So Dad's got this new language.
[time=2816] He can pray to God in his own language.
[time=2819] Next week I'm there, and I'm sharing about how God will show us in direct us through his word.
[time=2826] And he goes, "I can't read too good of English and stuff."
[time=2832] And I go, "Dad, I'll probably get you a Spanish Bible." "No." I go, "What? They got a Spanish Bible?" I go, "Well, I'm thinking, "Oh, they better have one now." So I call the Gideon's, and sure enough, they get him a Gideon translated Bible.
[time=2850] My dad changed Mitch from death to life, just like that.
[time=2855] He quit drinking, smoking, started going to church in Garrett, Indiana.
[time=2861] He was baptized.
[time=2863] And he became the man that, whenever I think about my dad, I'm not going to remember stuff about when he was a drunker, if I try.
[time=2872] But remember about my dad is the transformation that he made when Christ came into his life.
[time=2877] That's powerful.
[time=2878] We have about six minutes left that I might take a few more, but that's the vertical.
[time=2884] Both you, Ray, your brother, your dad, realize the biggest that ever incurred is let go in Christ.
[time=2891] And now I just want to transition into the horizontal debt that we're going to talk about.
[time=2897] April, 1984, kind of rocked our community.
[time=2902] I remember it like it was yesterday.
[time=2904] And your dad had a normal day, loved in the community, did his work in the fields, and a boy who he had invested in about, I think, 18 or 19 years old, maybe.
[time=2913] He had dated his mother, and they were broken up, and the mother sends him over, said he's just had a knee surgery, he won't be there, and she wants her stuff out of the house.
[time=2921] Why don't you pick it up from there and what happened?
[time=2924] Dad was there, and he did have his knee surgery, and he heard somebody jimmy in the lock,
[time=2930] and he answers the door, and David Woods is the boy's name, and says,
[time=2938] "What do you want? What are you doing?" "I need to get in. I need to use your phone. My mother needs an ambulance.
[time=2944] Use your phone. Our phone is broken. We need Pancho, please.
[time=2949] I need my mom's sick. Something's wrong. We need to call EMS." So Dad, I'm guessing, reluctantly opens the door, and David Woods stabs him.
[time=2959] And he pretty much cut him all away from his belly, all the way up to his heart.
[time=2968] It was very, very brutal in the way he killed my dad.
[time=2974] They testified in court that my dad asked him to call EMS,
[time=2980] and you talked about regret.
[time=2985] And I thought, I know my dad knew I would come.
[time=2988] I was a paramedic and four-wayed at that time, and I knew he was saying that because I would come and help him.
[time=2994] And so I thought about that a lot.
[time=2999] He ended up being tried and convicted of murder of my father, along with the other two guys,
[time=3005] and he was sentenced to death penalty.
[time=3010] I remember, you know, having...
[time=3013] Tell him what happened with your dad right before he probably passed away in that moment.
[time=3018] Yeah, before he passed away, they testified in court that they had stabbed him numerous times,
[time=3024] and my dad, they said, all of a sudden, he lucked up.
[time=3030] And he started talking.
[time=3034] And then say he was talking in Spanish, and he said he started talking.
[time=3037] And he's just lucking up, and I feel in my heart that my dad saw the gates of heaven.
[time=3050] And so they finished killing him, and I could remember even going through the court,
[time=3061] and every time after I would go, I would pray for these guys.
[time=3067] I would ask God to forgive them.
[time=3072] I knew where my dad was right away. David is convicted and sentenced.
[time=3084] The justice takes place now that he is sentenced to the death penalty.
[time=3088] And this was all in the news, you might remember it quite a bit in April and May, because 23 years later, David has not received the death penalty yet.
[time=3099] And as Arnie and I discuss it, I think that God had a plan that was unfolding,
[time=3105] and that plan included forgiveness of the horizontal death.
[time=3110] So you learn in church through a curriculum you're taking that may be, and this moment happens at the altar that you think that you're holding on to something against someone, and you write a letter to death row.
[time=3122] I write a letter to David, and I told him I had never ever told him or communicated to him personally
[time=3130] that I had forgiven him, and the guy that showed me that I had to do that.
[time=3135] And I told him, you know, Dave, you will probably see my father before I will.
[time=3141] It was like a month before he was to be executed.
[time=3144] And if you do, just do me a favor and embrace my dad, because I know he'll be there to greet you.
[time=3151] And I told him that 11th of Christ, and it was just a transformation of myself
[time=3160] to let go of that hidden agenda that I wasn't even aware of until the light of the word was poured upon it.
[time=3169] So he was to be executed, and we wrote a few times and corresponded, and my sister Emma also went to my father's church and realized during a sermon that she had to forgive Dave as well.
[time=3186] She actually had visited him and had written him, and had forgiven him.
[time=3192] 11 o'clock, he used to be executed at midnight, 11 o'clock, and my sister gets a phone call.
[time=3199] She answers the phone, hello, and hello, Emma?
[time=3204] Yeah?
[time=3205] Oh, this is David.
[time=3207] Of course, we have a brother, David. She was David. She was David Woods.
[time=3211] And she goes, what? He goes, yes, I talked to God into letting me make a final, final call.
[time=3219] And I only have about five minutes. And she said, David, why are you calling me?
[time=3226] You are going to be put to death in an hour. He goes, Emma?
[time=3230] He goes, I wanted to call the person that showed me the most love in my entire life.
[time=3236] And Mitch, it was like, this was the old sibling of the man that he had murdered that he was being put to death for,
[time=3246] and the magnitude of what happened there was just so awesome.
[time=3251] And so they talked, and before he hung up, he said, Emma, before I go, I just want to thank you again for loving me.
[time=3259] Thank your brother, Arnie, for the letters that he's written.
[time=3264] And I just want you to know that when they put me to death, that I am at total peace because I know where I'm going.
[time=3272] And I want your family to know that I'm sorry, and I will be praying for them as I die.
[time=3280] And it was God's timing. It took 23 years, and there was a reason for it, a purpose for it.
[time=3288] David had surrendered his life to Christ about nine or ten years into his sentence, or into his delay with a person who had invested in his life, a pastor.
[time=3298] And I think, based on what you've shared in your story, that feeling the freedom of forgiveness from you,
[time=3309] from your sister, probably allowed him to experience that peace and that freedom,
[time=3315] in his cell where you could have been yourself through what your actions were prior, in a way, maybe, that he wouldn't have experienced prior to that.
[time=3323] Our time is done. You walked in the door, and you might be in the prison of withholding forgiveness against another person.
[time=3336] I mean, that's common.
[time=3339] And I would just like you to know that the spirit of Christ that touched Arnie in his jail cell,
[time=3345] the spirit of Christ that touched David Woods in his jail cell, that same spirit of Christ is right here, right now, to touch you in yours.
[time=3355] And today can be the day that you can be free from the prison of withholding forgiveness.
[time=3361] And we have elders who will be up here in front. You can pray with Arnie. You can pray with one of the elders.
[time=3366] And today can be the day that you can be free.
[time=3368] Maybe you need to receive Christ as your Savior and Lord today, because I realize something here.
[time=3373] It's not me who's forgiving. It's Christ in me, who let's go.
[time=3379] And so, could you please thank Arnie for coming?
[time=3392] Thanks for inviting me. Thank you, Evan.
[time=3395] This is the beginning, I think, of Arnie to share at deeper levels of stories, or more miraculous and more detailed than what we've shared.
[time=3402] We've just touched the surface in order for you to catch what freedom can be like and forgiveness in Christ.
[time=3409] I'm going to pray for Arnie, but first I want you to know it.
[time=3411] Today at 1215, following this service, 1215 right now, we're asking members and regular attendees to gather for what will be a very brief announcement regarding a very important issue as we as a family need to be aware of. So, that's today at 1215, just in a few minutes right here.
[time=3425] So, please stand and join me in praying for Arnie, and I'll pray for you as well.
[time=3430] And me. God, thank you so much for the forgiver in Arnie and in his family,
[time=3438] and as other members wrestle with how to handle this.
[time=3441] God made me realize that justice and mercy come together at the cross of Jesus Christ, and that we can be free from trying to break that cross up into four pieces
[time=3452] and put that prison that we think is around our offender by ironically, it's around us, the withholders.
[time=3460] God, I pray that we will let go of horizontal debts against us and be free, not hold on,
[time=3466] because you have let go in Christ, the biggest that ever incurred our sin against the Holy God.
[time=3471] God, may we be free. Pray these things in Jesus mighty name. Amen. Thank you.
