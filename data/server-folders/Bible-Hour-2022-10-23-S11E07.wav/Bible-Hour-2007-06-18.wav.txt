[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[time=28] and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=52] Did you sing this with me, please?
[time=70] Let's say be your name, in the land that is plentiful, with the streams of abundance flow.
[time=97] Let's say be your name, in every blessing, in every blessing you pour out out, turn
[time=107] back to grace, when the darkness closes in court, still I will say, let's say be the
[time=118] name of the Lord, let's say be your name, let's say be the name of the Lord, let's say
[time=127] be the name of the Lord, let's say be your name, let's say be your name, in the Son,
[time=142] and of the Lord, let's say be the name of the Lord, let's say be the name of the Lord,
[time=160] let's say be your name, in every blessing you pour out out, turn back to grace, when
[time=178] the darkness closes in court, still I will say, let's say be the name of the Lord, let's
[time=188] say be your name, let's say be the name of the Lord, let's say be your name, in every
[time=205] blessing you pour out, turn back to grace, when you pour out, turn back to grace, when
[time=248] out, turn back to grace, when you pour out, turn back to grace, when you pour out, turn
[time=304] grace, when you pour out, turn back to grace, when you pour out, turn back to grace,
[time=350] pour out, turn back to grace, when you pour out, turn back to grace, when you pour out
[time=610] How would you pray with me?
[time=618] Father, when you gave John the disciple a glimpse of heaven, you showed him a scene where you
[time=627] were at the center and thousands were gathered with their faces in the ground before you
[time=635] declaring holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[time=643] And you also declared worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive glory and honor and power
[time=650] and dominion.
[time=653] And Father God, we want to join in that expression of worship today and just say that you are God and you are worthy to be praised.
[time=664] God we will declare your great deeds for you have rescued us from the dominion of darkness
[time=670] and brought us into your marvelous light.
[time=673] And ask God that you would help us to do our part to be ambassadors of you to be good stewards
[time=682] of the truth to love really well.
[time=687] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=690] You may be seated.
[time=694] Let me just say to you again how nice it is to be back in Fort Wayne.
[time=704] I am so amazed at what God allows you and I to experience you and your life and me and
[time=710] mine.
[time=711] I never in all my days have experienced anything like what we just saw and experienced in the
[time=717] last week.
[time=719] There have been a lot of experiences that God has given me, a lot of opportunities to meet people and come in contact with different cultures and all of it has been sweet.
[time=729] I have always learned something from the opportunities that God has given me in this last week as Brent and Dave and I had a chance to go to Kenya, East Africa and stay there for the most
[time=739] part in Nairobi the whole week involved there in furthering our relationship and building
[time=745] a friendship with an amazing group of people who are involved in if ever I have seen redemptive
[time=752] ministry.
[time=754] You know that word redemption that we love so much, the buying back of that which was lost, the bringing back to life that which was broken, this redeeming work that he does.
[time=765] Well in a place in an organization called New Life Home Trust, there in Nairobi and in
[time=771] four or five other satellite locations around Kenya, these people, these dear people are involved in trying to in a very faithful way bring life and hope back to babies.
[time=784] Young abandoned little ones and not only the babies but most of you would understand that babies become toddlers and toddlers become five year olds and life moves on and there
[time=796] is this enormous commitment on these people's part to be for these little ones, an investment,
[time=803] a place of refuge, a place of hope, a place of trust, a place where these little ones can see and experience our Lord.
[time=812] And if you were here second hour last week, you saw the DVD that kind of captures the message and the ministry of this place.
[time=820] If you weren't, you missed it but I'm going to just have him show it again to you this morning.
[time=824] It's an informative piece.
[time=825] It's hard to watch at times but I'm just here to tell you that it's really, really going on that these people and their great endeavor that God has given them is very, very real
[time=835] and ongoing and what you see in these pictures is exactly what's going on and I want to just show that to you again, give you a chance to watch it and before I do that, I want to just read you Exodus 22, Exodus 22, let me just read this to you that it's not going to be on the screen and I just want you to listen.
[time=853] He asked me to the day what it was I felt in my heart was God's view toward orphans.
[time=861] And I didn't know what else to do but to just look to the scriptures and there you find
[time=867] a number of references.
[time=868] I want to just read this to you in Exodus 22 as God gives the law to the people of Israel.
[time=873] He makes it very clear what his mind and his heart are toward orphans.
[time=879] He makes it very clear how there to be viewed, he makes it very clear how there to be treated and he makes it very clear as to how he'll respond when they're not, when they're not
[time=891] treated and when they're not responded to in the way that he designed it.
[time=895] It says in Exodus 22, it says you shall not afflict any widow or orphan.
[time=908] If you afflict them at all and if he does cry out to me, I will surely hear his cry and
[time=916] my anger will be kindled and I will kill you.
[time=922] God says to the people of Israel, as in that day he lays out his law for them.
[time=930] He says in my anger will be kindled and I will kill you with the sword and your wives
[time=936] shall become widows and your children, what?
[time=943] Orphans.
[time=945] This is the ministry of a place and a people who are doing their very best with God's
[time=951] help to respond to the need that exists there in Kenya with a growing orphan population
[time=958] you can just watch.
[time=969] We don't know her name, we don't know why she did this.
[time=974] We don't know the cause of her desperation.
[time=978] What we do know is that she brought her newborn baby in a plastic bag to this garbage pile
[time=984] along the side of the road and ran away.
[time=993] Approximately 300 newborn babies are abandoned in Kenya, East Africa every day, every day.
[time=1004] Kenya is a place that reaches out and grabs you a land of breathtaking scenery but under
[time=1010] this incredible beauty lies a desperate ink.
[time=1014] Thousands of people are migrating from small rural villages into already crowded Nairobi
[time=1020] and among the masses many of these people find dead ends, no work and no home.
[time=1026] Nairobi is home to Kibera, one of the largest slums in Africa.
[time=1031] Most of these homes are only one dark room with a dirt floor.
[time=1036] The ten roofs covering these small mud homes stretch as far as the eye can see.
[time=1042] There is no clean running water nor sanitation, the people wait for the rain to flush the outdoor toilets down to the next row of homes or to the creek below.
[time=1053] Nearly 1 million people live here and of the nearly 4 million people in this city, 80 percent
[time=1060] live in slums and shanty towns.
[time=1062] The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Kenya is one of the highest in Africa.
[time=1068] This is a place of desperation.
[time=1072] This is often the case in heartbreaking situations.
[time=1075] The most vulnerable, the children are forgotten.
[time=1079] They pay the greatest price.
[time=1082] Three hundred babies are abandoned in Kenya every day.
[time=1086] They are abandoned along roads, in fields or left in the bush to be eaten by wild animals.
[time=1093] Some are dropped in outdoor toilets or sewage ditches.
[time=1096] Most do not survive.
[time=1098] Three hundred babies every day, abandoned and forgotten.
[time=1104] All the odds are stacked against them.
[time=1109] In a plantation field, workers hear the cry of a baby girl.
[time=1114] She is found and taken to a small community hospital.
[time=1117] A baby boy, born two months premature, is found at a plastic bag on a garbage heap.
[time=1123] Some children passing by hear a faint sound and notice the small bundle, they carry the baby to a nearby police station.
[time=1131] They have been found, but the road ahead remains treacherous.
[time=1134] With weakened, damaged immune systems, how will they survive?
[time=1140] These two babies both ended up at this small, poorly equipped community hospital.
[time=1146] The fact that they are here is miracle number one.
[time=1150] Now, they need another miracle.
[time=1154] When abandoned babies arrive here, they are placed in a room not much larger than a closet.
[time=1160] The staff is overwhelmed, pushed to their limits.
[time=1165] That is when they pick up the phone and call New Life Home.
[time=1169] When the staff at New Life receives the call, they hurry to the small, outlying community,
[time=1175] hoping that they can give a baby a second chance at life.
[time=1180] On arrival, they meet these two babies for the first time and prepare them for departure.
[time=1186] When they arrive at the New Life Home, another miracle takes place in the lives of these two precious babies as they begin receiving nurture and loving care.
[time=1195] Hi.
[time=1196] Welcome to Mayville Beach, the city in the sun.
[time=1201] New Life Home, a Christian medical care center for abandoned babies, is located in the heart of Nairobi.
[time=1207] It is here that the babies are given names.
[time=1210] For the baby girl, it is Katie.
[time=1213] And for the little boys, Luca, their bathed, weighed, and given new clothing, and the battle
[time=1219] to give them a second chance to survive and grow begins.
[time=1224] In most cases, babies arrive in very poor health, sometimes just clinging to life.
[time=1232] Some do not survive.
[time=1235] If one-third of the babies here were born to HIV positive mothers, however, if the babies were abandoned at birth prior to nursing from their mother and are given good medical care,
[time=1246] more than 90% of them become HIV negative and are able to live a healthy, normal life.
[time=1252] But every baby that arrives here is desperately in need of care.
[time=1256] Their immune system is weakened and they are subject to life-threatening infections and disease.
[time=1262] Next to an excellent staff of doctors, nurses, and caregivers, most of these babies grow strong and healthy.
[time=1269] They are given first-rate medical care and are held, loved, and prayed for.
[time=1275] Nearly all of them become healthy and strong.
[time=1278] In most cases, by the age of two, they are adopted into a loving and caring home.
[time=1284] Now one year later, Luca has become very popular among the staff at New Life Home.
[time=1290] He's a little charmer, this little premature baby is strong and happy.
[time=1294] He is awaiting an adoptive family.
[time=1298] Katie was recently adopted by loving parents, where she continues to blossom.
[time=1304] New Life Home exists thanks to caring people like you.
[time=1308] Your contributions make it possible for this beacon of hope to exist and to provide care
[time=1314] for many of these babies who are found in time, nurtured, and given new life.
[time=1320] Without more faithful support, many more babies would be without hope and would be forgotten.
[time=1327] They would not have life.
[time=1329] Thank you for helping make such a life-changing difference with these precious abandoned babies
[time=1335] in East Africa.
[time=1337] Please contact us at New Life Home at www.newlifehometrust.org or at newlifehome@neb.rr.com.
[time=1348] Amen, isn't that a good thing?
[time=1356] Wow.
[time=1358] An amazing team of people, giving themselves to an amazing endeavor.
[time=1362] I wanted to show you some pictures real quick, kind of feel like a missionary, giving you my slideshow.
[time=1369] But then there's a whole lot more we could show you.
[time=1371] We just picked a few out this morning, so much more to share with you and so much more to catch you up on, and we'll do it in the days to come.
[time=1378] But this morning, I just wanted to give you a couple of pictures.
[time=1380] This is a great shot for a couple of reasons.
[time=1382] One, the first day there, they just took us in a van, they had a driver take us out of Nairobi to the bush country three, four hours outside to a game preserve, and I wanted
[time=1394] us to just see what it was like out there, and I think just experience some of Kenya,
[time=1400] and it was really cool.
[time=1401] I mean, it was definitely way beyond a trip to the zoo, I'll tell you that.
[time=1405] These were like real animals, and we were at a place where the animals would just, you wouldn't get, this is one like a safari where you got in the Land Rover and went out to find them.
[time=1414] You got a place where they kind of came to you, and you stood on a deck literally at a hotel out in the middle of nowhere, and there was a watering hole, salt blocks, and I am telling you, the whole Noah's Ark came to, within a 24-hour span, they were there.
[time=1431] The great thing about this picture though is this.
[time=1433] Dave Walters is one of the guys who went, Dave's in the white.
[time=1438] Anybody who knows Brynheimer knows that that's not Brynheimer's t-shirt.
[time=1441] Brynheimer would take a bullet for Ohio State, and what Dave Walters did was he photoshopped
[time=1447] Purdue onto a black t-shirt of Brents.
[time=1451] Is that absolutely rotten or what?
[time=1452] I don't know if Brents here or not, but Dave will pay, but that's the three of us, and
[time=1459] let me just, I'll just go through these next few real quick.
[time=1461] We just had a great time seeing some amazing sights.
[time=1466] I think you'll see, that's where we got dropped off.
[time=1468] I was surprised you may not be, I kind of think, when I think Africa, I think I'm probably
[time=1474] just a product of watching Lion King four million times, and I just think Serengeti and
[time=1480] Big Trees and Dry Grass and just kind of flat, and that's the way it is in northern Africa.
[time=1488] Central Africa, Kenya, very hilly, very green, absolutely beautiful.
[time=1492] It was an amazing, amazing place.
[time=1496] These aren't like postcards, all right?
[time=1498] You didn't go to Google Images and just throw these in here.
[time=1500] This is like where we were like right there, took these pictures.
[time=1503] It was really amazing, beautiful stuff.
[time=1506] We were sitting on the deck, and the leaves and the trees start kind of shaking, and all of a sudden, boom, out comes the family of elephants, and absolutely incredible.
[time=1516] We had a chance then the next day to start in at the orphanage, and I want to just show you a few pictures here of what we got to encounter there.
[time=1524] Just real quick for you, when a baby's brought in, oftentimes they're in really, really bad shape.
[time=1530] Like the DVD said, oftentimes they don't make it the ones that do oftentimes need intensive medical treatment.
[time=1536] So while it's an orphanage on the front end, it's really almost like an ICU, and they took us, the first place they took us to was where the little little babies were that had just come in, and they stay in one part of the orphanage there, you know, one, two, three months, depending on what kind of care they need, but it was in that part that we first got to meet a few of the little ones, I think this is Dorkus, I think my kids laughed when
[time=1560] they heard that name, and then I had to tell them it was actually a Bible name, it's a very cool name, and she was a very sweet little girl, that's Dorkus and me, I think there's a picture of Brent coming up, this was a pretty cool thing.
[time=1573] We got there the first morning, we're starting to just kind of make our way through the little nursery with the real tiny little guys, and this one's just a few days old, and this is Brent Imer, and when they handed this little guy to Brent, they asked Brent what his name
[time=1587] was, Brent said my name's Brent, and they all laughed because the baby's name was Brent.
[time=1592] And so that's little Brent and big Brent, and they had a great time together, I think there's a picture here of Dave with a little one as well, again back in the kind of the ICU, early stages of life there at New Hope, and then maybe even a few other ones that
[time=1609] just, there you go, just some faces, we'll just kind of scroll through these.
[time=1615] A lot of them really, really healthy, a lot of them really sick, you got to stop there.
[time=1622] There was a rumor going, I got an email from one of my kids while I was over there saying "Dad, what's with you and feed in the bay?" I want to just clear this up, this is not me feeding that baby, that is Dave Walters showing
[time=1635] his complete ineptness, in my opinion, of feeding a toddler, I've fed a toddler before, I understand
[time=1641] how that works, you don't let it drip like that.
[time=1645] And look at the guy behind him, looking at Dave, like what are you thinking?
[time=1651] I mean in the poor kid in the front, I mean he's hungry, so he's just taking it, but he can't be having a good time.
[time=1656] It's obvious Dave didn't help much with Jane on the whole feeding front, but as sloppy
[time=1662] a job as he's doing there, Dave's getting it done, this was in the toddler section, you
[time=1668] know it's one thing, I was reminded, it's one thing to hold a baby, it's one thing to hold an infant, you know, for hours and just marvel at it and feed it and burp it and cuddle it and wrap it up.
[time=1679] I mean that's an amazing deal, it takes a little bit of work and effort.
[time=1683] It's a completely different ball game, most of you know, and I just got reminded of it, and it's time to take about 25 toddlers out to the grass for three to four hours of playtime
[time=1696] with cars and wagons and balls and mats, I mean it's just a lot of work and a lot going
[time=1702] on with these little guys and gals, about 55 total from the infants to the oldest toddler
[time=1709] on the Nairobi campus there at New Life, about probably 25 of the 55 HIV infected.
[time=1720] It was interesting as we talked with the leadership there at the orphanage, you know, they don't let that be known, I thought that was interesting, none of the workers, the medical staff obviously
[time=1730] because of the medications that are necessary and the directors know, but none of the staff know which of the kids are HIV and which of the kids aren't.
[time=1740] They don't want to in any way, shape or form, distinguish between, you know, the two camps,
[time=1746] they wouldn't want, even though these are good-hearted people, good-hearted workers who you'd want to think just wouldn't care, there's just this sense where they want everybody, all these kids to be treated and loved and cared for and kissed and changed and bathed and all the things that the workers do, so that's just kind of kept out of the equation in terms of public knowledge and they're just a precious, precious bunch of kids who have a great time with an amazing staff, a few more pictures here of some little ones.
[time=1779] Really a lot of fun and that is, that's David and David was just over a year and that picture
[time=1789] and the several hours I spent with David that day, it reminded me that, and then we talked
[time=1796] about this, the staff was real upfront with this, most of the staff there, most of the paid staff that give care and most of the volunteer staff are women and that's a good thing and you all understand as do I, that in God's great design a child needs a woman's
[time=1812] touch on so many fronts and for so many reasons.
[time=1817] You also would understand that in God's great design a child desperately needs a man.
[time=1822] He needs that touch and that perspective and there aren't a lot of them that would come
[time=1830] and volunteer, there aren't a lot of men who will come and spend all those hours each day playing blocks and tooling them around and wagons and it just was amazing to me to be
[time=1842] in that I understand that from having my own, you understand that from having your own.
[time=1847] It was amazing for us to see how they took to us, amazing to see how they enjoyed and
[time=1853] how much it meant to them to play a little rough house and have a man's touch and I
[time=1859] was so very grateful for the chance to do so.
[time=1862] And let me just tell you a little bit about some of the things that we learned, I can't wait to just share with you some things this morning from the Scriptures that God just I think really brought to the forefront of my mind and my heart in recent days as I look
[time=1878] back on all that he showed us.
[time=1880] I want to say something to you about Kibera, you heard about it in the DVD, Kibera actually
[time=1887] the largest slum, the largest slum in the entire world.
[time=1892] Nairobi is a town of about 3.2, 3.5 million people.
[time=1896] I was surprised, again, I think I had a preconceived notion of what Africa was like.
[time=1901] We fly into Nairobi, Nairobi is a city, Nairobi is a metropolitan place, Nairobi's got the skyscrapers, Nairobi's got the five star hotels downtown, Nairobi is a place of commerce and government and all kinds of stuff going on in Nairobi.
[time=1915] But the amazing thing is that right next to all of that, right on the outskirts of Nairobi is Kibera.
[time=1922] There's no way, there isn't any way any of you in this room are going to get your arms
[time=1928] around this, I promise you.
[time=1930] But I'll just say it to you, Kibera is the largest slum in the world.
[time=1935] In Kibera there are a million people, probably at this point a little over a million people.
[time=1942] Most of us in the room can't imagine that.
[time=1945] So you just go ahead right now in your mind and just try to imagine a million people.
[time=1950] I don't know, think about a football stadium that's got 110,000 packed in and then just
[time=1956] go ahead and think about a million people, young ones, moms and dads, senior citizens,
[time=1962] young adults, boys, girls of all ages.
[time=1966] And Kibera's million people, Kibera itself, here you go, Kibera takes up 1.3 square miles.
[time=1977] A million people in 1.3 square miles with no toilets, and no water, and no electricity.
[time=1990] And literally what you just saw on that screen, just a square hut with aluminum cardboard
[time=1996] sightings and a dirt floor.
[time=1998] And if you're living large in Kibera, you've got a mattress on the ground.
[time=2004] And that's it.
[time=2007] And here's what absolutely blew my mind and here's what brought great conviction.
[time=2012] Here's one of you who want to ask me some of the things I took away from the trip.
[time=2015] Here would be one thing I took away from the trip.
[time=2017] I had heard about, we had seen kind of the outskirts of, you don't go into a six, seven white guy doesn't walk into the heart of Kibera on his own.
[time=2026] It wasn't like a tourist stop.
[time=2029] We saw the outskirts of Kibera.
[time=2030] We heard about Kibera.
[time=2031] We'd seen pictures of Kibera.
[time=2035] I understood what it was like.
[time=2038] And we're about half way through the week, and we're talking with Lee and Anne Marie, the directors there at the orphanage.
[time=2044] And here's what I realized.
[time=2046] Here's what I learned that day.
[time=2049] The staff that you just saw, here's the thing about Nairobi.
[time=2053] The staff that you just saw in those pictures, and the staff that I had gotten to know over those first couple of days, these gracious, kind-hearted women and a few men, these, these
[time=2065] generous people who came in every single morning and stayed late every single night, and served
[time=2071] and loved and cuddled and cared and laughed and played games and changed diapers and fixed
[time=2077] beds.
[time=2079] Some of the most gracious people I had ever been around my entire life.
[time=2084] I'm talking to Lee about his staff, and I'm asking Lee how far most of them have to travel
[time=2091] to come to work each day.
[time=2093] He just looks at me like you don't understand, do you?
[time=2097] I said, "What?" He says, "They live in Kibera, all of them, all of those gals, and their families, three,
[time=2112] four, five, six, seven people, live in that slum and get up every day, and that's their
[time=2120] world, and yet they come and joyously and graciously and faithfully and diligently give
[time=2129] themselves away." And I was a little bums that couldn't find any shampoo in my hotel room.
[time=2147] The whole Kibera reality is just amazing to me.
[time=2150] When you begin to understand one out of every three people in Nairobi, live in Kibera in the slum, you begin to understand the reality of abandoned babies.
[time=2159] Understand this, three things that go on there.
[time=2162] Yes, there is a growing sense in that culture and in that community that an HIV mother,
[time=2169] as she gives birth to a baby, most of those gals are convinced that because they've contracted
[time=2175] HIV because they're sick, the baby's going to be sick.
[time=2178] They have no capacity to care for that little one.
[time=2180] They have no ability to come alongside, and so oftentimes, yes, it is the HIV situation that leads that young lady or that couple to drop that baby off in a pile of garbage
[time=2192] in a sewer ditch alongside the road or in the bush.
[time=2196] The other thing that kicks in there is just, again, what was mentioned, the unbelievable poverty.
[time=2203] These aren't malicious women who don't want their babies, for the most part.
[time=2207] For the most part, there are women who have no concept, no clue, and no hope.
[time=2210] They have no conception of how in the world they could ever care for or provide for this little one.
[time=2216] And so in desperation, watch this, it's almost strategic.
[time=2220] They understand, they understand that there will be people.
[time=2224] They know that there will be people digging through the garbage.
[time=2227] You with me?
[time=2229] They know that there are always people walking alongside the road in close to sewage ditches.
[time=2237] They know that along the street, at least there might be a chance somebody might find this crying little plastic bag.
[time=2246] And so while HIV is a huge issue and the cause of a lot of the abandonment poverty itself plays in thirdly, and we had a great discussion about this, not great, very sad and tragic, but helpful and informative physical handicaps.
[time=2260] More and more so now, as physical deformities show up at birth, you see a Kenyan woman, a Kenyan family needs a child to be mobile, needs that child to be active, needs that child to be healthy, to be able to sustain and bear up under the life that they know he
[time=2276] or she is going to have to face.
[time=2277] And so if there's a enlarged head, if there's cerebral palsy, if there's any kind of physical
[time=2284] deformity they get tossed.
[time=2286] And when those get found, now we're not just talking about HIV and medications, now we're
[time=2292] talking about a level of care and a kind of coming alongside that carries with it enormous
[time=2299] implications physically and emotionally.
[time=2303] Now you've got a little two-week-old, which is going to become, hopefully, God willing a two-year-old with some issues that will require an enormous amount of time and attention
[time=2317] and resources.
[time=2319] One of the things that the New Life Home Trust, the central home there in Nairobi and
[time=2326] the four or five other satellite homes, one of the things they're hoping to experience in the days to come, and to be honest with you, one of the things I hope we can help with in the days to come, is a special facility, probably not in Nairobi, probably in Mumbasa or one of the outlying areas, probably a special needs home, probably a building with rooms
[time=2345] and staff and medical facilities dedicated to the physically disabled and the special needs that they're experiencing more and more so these days.
[time=2357] Four other homes, that's what it is, four other homes across Kenya, and as we talk, we realize there were computer needs, computer computer computer, just the need for computers, the need for computer network help, construction and remodeling assistance, financial needs,
[time=2372] support staff needs, teachers.
[time=2374] You know what's happened is as the kids have gotten older, guess what they've done?
[time=2377] As the kids have gotten older, the staff and the leadership of the organization have now started schools.
[time=2383] They're trying to provide education now for these kids.
[time=2385] They're trying to provide feeding programs for not just their kids.
[time=2390] Their kids are fed, but as they start these schools in the outlying areas, now kids from the villages are coming and now those kids who are hungry and in need themselves are
[time=2400] having the opportunity of being fed.
[time=2402] Being fed education, being fed food, being fed spiritual love and investment, it's an amazing thing.
[time=2409] Computers and construction and remodeling and money and support staff and supplies, clothes,
[time=2415] formula and the list goes on and on.
[time=2424] Let me ask you a question this morning.
[time=2429] Just to maybe get your mind moving in this direction, and I'll tell you what, somebody mentioned to me this morning after first hour, so I guess we'll pick up heaven next week.
[time=2438] And in a sense, yeah, we're going to come back to the official heaven series next week, but I just, I guess the way I was thinking about it this morning, the more I considered all this and the more I thought back on it, I feel like this is really very connected to a study of heaven.
[time=2454] All this that we saw and all this that we took in, extremely connected, very pertinent for you and for me as we think about heaven, as we think about eternity.
[time=2463] And you know what, not just eternity.
[time=2466] Let me say this, I feel like in the last week I saw a little bit of heaven on earth, and
[time=2472] the fact of the matter is, I feel like I saw a little bit of hell on earth as well.
[time=2478] And I think it's important for you and I while we are okay to think about and even be anticipating
[time=2484] and consumed with what will be someday, the fact of the matter is I love how in the Lord's
[time=2490] prayer it talks about in heaven as it is on earth.
[time=2497] I love the opportunity.
[time=2498] I love the picture of his kingdom coming to this place.
[time=2502] I love the chance you and I have as priests to make a difference in people's lives.
[time=2507] I love it when we get a chance to pass along heaven, to pass along all that is glorious about our God and what he's promised to those that need it most.
[time=2517] Let me ask you a question.
[time=2519] What would you say is the clearest, most obvious indicator that could be observed in
[time=2526] someone's life, you're looking at my life.
[time=2530] I'm looking at your life, we're observing somebody's life.
[time=2534] Let me just ask you this, what would be in your mind the most obvious, the most clearest
[time=2540] indicator that would give evidence that that person is a genuine follower of Christ.
[time=2547] If you were trying to establish a really clear picture of what a really saved person looks
[time=2553] like and what a really saved God following, God honoring person does, what are the first
[time=2560] few things that come to your mind?
[time=2564] With all that you and I have been taught about this, with all that you and I have kind of running through our minds and hearts along those lines, what is it that comes to your mind if I'm asking you to paint a picture and put at the very top the first two or three
[time=2579] things that would give indication as you looked at somebody and watched them that they know
[time=2585] the Lord, they're a God follower, they're genuinely his.
[time=2596] Most of us in the room, I won't speak for all of you, but over the years if you would
[time=2602] have asked me that question, I think most of us in the room would have begun to mention things like knowledge, you know, knowledge and understanding of God's Word which is absolutely
[time=2612] I think pertinent and I think absolutely an indicator of someone who is growing in their knowledge of the Word of God and a lot of us would speak to that issue, obedience to Christ commands, people would want to talk about an obedient life which is good.
[time=2628] We would start talking about those who genuinely know him as being those who possess wisdom and spiritual discernment, we talk about those involved in evangelism, those who come to
[time=2639] church on a faithful basis, those who give a great deal and sacrifice in their stewardship.
[time=2647] Nothing wrong with any of the above, I just find it interesting.
[time=2652] I find it compelling that in James 1.27, God through the pen of James as he writes answers
[time=2664] that very question and God's Word says, "pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our
[time=2672] God and Father is this," here's the answer to our question, you want to know what would characterize somebody who's genuinely following him, genuinely belongs to the Lord, pure and undefiled religion and the sight of our God and Father is this to visit orphans, to visit
[time=2691] orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
[time=2702] Now, I just got to ask you and I just got to ask myself and I've got to keep asking
[time=2708] myself, where were those two things on your list?
[time=2713] Why haven't those two things been higher on my list all these years?
[time=2720] What is it that we've missed?
[time=2723] Where has the disconnect taken place?
[time=2727] Why would, when asked that question, why would so many of you in the room this morning
[time=2733] myself included, not have said, well, do they visit orphans in distress?
[time=2744] What this first reminds us of is that fundamentally our God, the one true God, the God of the Bible is about compassion, sacrificial caring, selfless service.
[time=2756] I do believe that priests, I do believe that genuine Christ followers do and will grow in
[time=2763] their knowledge of God's Word, in their obedience, in their wisdom, in their ministry involvement.
[time=2768] I think those things do take place, but I also believe that there are some who experience
[time=2774] growth and activity in those arenas who never embrace God's call to a God-like compassion.
[time=2784] And in the process, they miss, what did James say?
[time=2787] They miss pure and undefiled religion.
[time=2795] And Jesus might say, actually, you know what, Jesus, he did say, Jesus said it a little bit stronger.
[time=2801] And I want to just remind you of that this morning, every one of you, Jesus said it a little bit stronger than James does.
[time=2810] Turn your Bibles to Matthew 25 verses 31 to 46, let me just read this through.
[time=2817] Somebody on the plane asked me on the way back why we did it, why we had done all that way and done what we had done.
[time=2824] And it was just helpful for me to think these things through, to be reminded, especially
[time=2830] this Matthew 25 passage.
[time=2831] Look what it says in 25-31, but when the sun, and this has to do with the very study we're in, this paints a picture of that final judgment that we've talked about already in our heaven series.
[time=2841] But when the son of man comes in his glory, it says in verse 31, "And all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.
[time=2850] All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from one another.
[time=2857] As the shepherd separates the sheep, sheep there being biblically sheep, always kind
[time=2863] of connected to symbolically believers, and the goats, goats biblically, always kind
[time=2869] of symbolically being associated with unbelievers.
[time=2872] So he separates the sheep from the goat, and he will put the sheep on his right, the right
[time=2878] hand side, the right side always being a place of honor and respect, and the goats on the
[time=2884] left, the left hand side, always being a place of disrespect and dishonor.
[time=2889] Then the king will say to those on his right.
[time=2892] So this is God now speaking to those who are in.
[time=2899] This is the Lord now speaking to the righteous.
[time=2902] And he says to them, "Come, you who are blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
[time=2908] for you from the foundation of the world.
[time=2912] For I was hungry." He says to them, "Hey," he says, "Look at me." He says, "For I was hungry," he's talking to them.
[time=2917] And you gave me something to eat.
[time=2919] "I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink.
[time=2922] I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
[time=2926] Naked, and you clothed me.
[time=2927] I was sick, and you visited me.
[time=2930] I was in prison, and you came to me." And then all the righteous says, "Then the righteous will answer him." So you have all these people that he's just said this to, and you have all these folks looking at him going, "Huh?" "What?" "When?" I mean, we're glad we're thankful to be all around the right side here.
[time=2953] But please, do tell us, when in the world did we ever do that to you?
[time=2959] When did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink?
[time=2963] When?" Verse 38, he says, he goes on to say, "In verse 38, "And when did we see you a stranger and invite you in or naked and clothe you?" Verse 39, "When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?" And the Lord responds, "The king will answer, and say to them, 'Truly I say to you to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of mine, even the least of them, even the least
[time=2987] of them, even the smallest of them, even the most desperate of them, to the extent that
[time=2994] you did it to the poorest of them, to the most marginalized, to the sickest, to the extent
[time=3001] that you did it to the least of them," he says, "You did it to me." And then he moves on in verse 41, "Then he will also say to those on his left, apart from me, 'A cursed ones.'" Watch the language here, "A cursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared
[time=3019] for the devil and his angels, for I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat.
[time=3025] I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink." Now as a stranger and you did not invite me in naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me, then they themselves also answered, "Lord, Lord, when
[time=3041] did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison that did not
[time=3047] take care of you?" And he gives them the exact same answer, "Then he will answer and say, 'Truly I say to you to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these.
[time=3058] You did not do it to me.'" On the passage ends there in verse 46, "These will go away into eternal punishment but the
[time=3067] righteous into eternal life."
[time=3074] That's how important it is.
[time=3076] He could have used any illustration.
[time=3079] He could have used any arena of life.
[time=3081] He could have used any activity that he wanted to choose to make that point and he chooses
[time=3087] these things, my friends, the way you and I treat, the way you and I feed, the way you and I clothe, the way you and I come alongside and as priests pass along the compassion of
[time=3099] our Lord.
[time=3103] Let me ask you this morning, who's your widow?
[time=3107] You know what?
[time=3108] We're going to go back to Kenya.
[time=3110] We're going to go back to Nairobi and we're going to go to Mombasa and we're going to go to Lamu Island and we're going to go to the other.
[time=3117] We are going to go back and you need to pray for us, pray for wisdom as we figure out how to do that in a way that would be meaningful and God honoring and we'll invite you to come.
[time=3129] We'll invite young people to come, we'll invite senior adults to come.
[time=3133] We'll invite you to come and you can come and hold babies and you can come help fix computers and you can come and help remodel facilities.
[time=3140] We're going to go back and I hope you'll join us.
[time=3144] And here's what I want to say to you this morning.
[time=3146] How about today?
[time=3148] About tomorrow?
[time=3149] How about this week?
[time=3150] Who's your widow?
[time=3151] Who's your orphan?
[time=3153] Who's hungry?
[time=3154] Who's thirsty?
[time=3155] Who's in prison?
[time=3156] Who has less than you?
[time=3158] And what are you willing to do?
[time=3161] How are you willing to posture yourself?
[time=3164] How are you willing to raise the awareness of that in your kids' lives?
[time=3169] How able are you to assess the needs of those in your neighborhood?
[time=3172] Those in your workplace?
[time=3175] Please, I'm inviting you this week to give it some thought.
[time=3181] To understand that biblical Christianity as we see it played out for us again and again
[time=3187] in Scripture while it contains a number of components, one of them and obviously one God went to great lengths to make a very big deal about is your willingness in mind to go.
[time=3197] To go across the street and to go across the world to help.
[time=3201] And then I hope, I hope in each and every one of you that there's the willingness and the readiness to do that.
[time=3208] Here's what you've got to do.
[time=3209] You've got to go home today and get on your knees.
[time=3211] You've got to go home tonight with your family, your friends, your small group, those in your class.
[time=3217] You've got to get with some people and get on your knees and beg God to give you antenna, to give you radar, to give you a sense, an ability to connect.
[time=3225] He'll do it.
[time=3226] I mean, we're going to help you in some specific ways, but I want it to be something that's a part of your everyday life.
[time=3234] Oh, God, give us the strength and the grace and the compassion to be aware of those in our world that have need and allow us to be those who would feed, allow us to be those who would give a drink, allow us to be those who would clothe.
[time=3247] I got so excited about our garage sale thinking about all this.
[time=3251] Are you kidding me?
[time=3253] $1,300 in an effort to give people water who can't get a drink and have nets, so mosquitoes
[time=3262] won't kill them.
[time=3265] I was so proud of you and so thankful to be a part of something like that.
[time=3270] What do you say we just keep doing it, huh?
[time=3273] What do you say we keep giving ourselves to that kind of endeavor?
[time=3276] [AMEN] Okay, last thing, and I'll let you go, why don't you stand, please, just right where
[time=3284] you are.
[time=3285] Stand and please don't leave.
[time=3286] Just be real quiet.
[time=3287] Let me say this to you.
[time=3288] I want to take you back to James 1.
[time=3290] It'll be on the screen.
[time=3291] Look at that.
[time=3292] We forgot the whole last part, and I want to just say this to you, pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this, to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
[time=3310] Anybody in the room ever struggle on a daily, anybody in the room struggle at all with
[time=3317] being stained by the world.
[time=3323] Anybody struggle with being stained by the world?
[time=3329] The world's temptations, the world's mindset, the world's false hopes, the world's false
[time=3337] system, the world's false philosophy.
[time=3340] Anybody in the room?
[time=3341] Yeah, I know.
[time=3342] Everyone knows.
[time=3343] You know what was so amazing to me is that this last week as I gave myself, this Brent
[time=3350] and Dave, as we found ourselves in that situation, and I think many of you in the room can probably attest to this, I haven't in years.
[time=3358] I have not for years felt so far away from the stain of the world than I did in this past
[time=3367] week.
[time=3368] I was joking with somebody about my, you know, my cell phone, some of you give me a bad
[time=3375] time about my cell phone, you know, my cell phone wouldn't work, and it was a great thing.
[time=3383] And Brent and Dave had laptops, but I didn't, because I don't know how to work a laptop, so I just borrowed theirs every once in a while, but, you know, no laptop, no cell phone.
[time=3393] The TV was just like, it was hilarious, you couldn't understand half of it.
[time=3398] No, not a lot of TV and didn't go to movies, and nothing evil about movies, nothing evil
[time=3405] about TV, nothing evil about laptops or cell phones.
[time=3408] Don't get me wrong, but are you, are you with me?
[time=3411] When you put yourself in a situation whereby life becomes that simple, and when the situation you put yourself in is visiting orphans and widows, when you and I are given to clothing those that are naked and feeding those that are hungry, when that's what you're doing and that's what you get to be consumed with, you understand how far away you start to feel
[time=3430] from the, from the junk that wants to stain you, and I would just encourage you, I don't
[time=3437] think you have to go to Nairobi to experience that, I think we have to be believers who are engaged in that which matters most, consumed with it.
[time=3448] God, thank you for the morning and thank you for these dear friends and this family and what you're doing here, God, in and through us.
[time=3455] We sense that there's a lot that you've got yet to teach us and a lot that you would desire to bring us through, and God, we want to just open ourselves to that.
[time=3464] Thank you for what's going on right now in Nairobi, thanks for what's going on in other places across the world where Christ followers are giving themselves away, priests passing
[time=3475] along you to others.
[time=3478] God allow us to do that day in and day out faithfully in your son's name we pray, amen.
