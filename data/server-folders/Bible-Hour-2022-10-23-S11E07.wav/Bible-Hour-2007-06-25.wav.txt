[time=885] Where leaders of all people on planet Earth have to step it up.
[time=893] And you can, Prince. You can.
[time=898] [MUSIC]
[time=916] Well, there you have it. Pretty amazing. Pretty awe-inspiring.

[time=982] â™ª Congratulations. Today is your day. You're off to a great place. You're off and away.
[time=993] You've got brains in your head. You've got feet in your shoes.
[time=996] You can steer yourself heavenward if that's what you choose.
[time=998] You've got a Bible and you know what you know. And you are the one who decide where you'll go.
[time=1003] Heaven's a place where you'll go. You'll be on your way up. You'll be seeing great sights.
[time=1008] You'll join all the angels who sort of high heights.
[time=1011] Jesus will be there. The prophets will too.
[time=1013] Your friends and your neighbors. And your pet kangaroo. We're all getting in.
[time=1018] To walk streets of pure gold. We all get a big mansion.
[time=1021] With many rooms I've been told. There'll be jobs, but no stress.
[time=1024] There'll be work, but no toil. There'll be no leftovers, no need for tin foil.
[time=1029] Time is irrelevant. All mysteries revealed. No tears, no death. Every sickness is healed.
[time=1035] There is no cholesterol. You've got nothing to lose. Why you can eat butter all day long if you choose.
[time=1040] Heaven's a place where you'll go. There is fun to be done. All your questions are answered.
[time=1045] All your races are won. But how will we get there?
[time=1048] Will we wander in Rome? Is there really a chariot coming forth to carry me home?
[time=1053] And deliver us right at the Great Pearly Gate? Will there be a long line?
[time=1057] How long will I wait? And when I get in, should I turn left or right?
[time=1062] Or right in three quarters? Or maybe not quite?
[time=1065] Perhaps you should just go and follow the light.
[time=1068] Heaven's a place where you'll go.
[time=1072] Now I know we've been silly. Just as silly as can be.
[time=1076] About a place where Christ's followers spend all eternity. But we're not even there yet.
[time=1081] We've had only a peek. There's so many questions about the home we all seek.
[time=1086] And we have a question for you. I'll do pray and tell us how we should be living today.
[time=1092] If we really knew what was waiting, if our minds could just grasp.
[time=1096] Setting our thoughts on things above and doing what Christ has asked.
[time=1100] We have a new life in Christ. Gone is our old way indeed.
[time=1104] Gone are lust, evil desires, impurity and greed.
[time=1108] If you are who you say you are, you must live holy every day.
[time=1113] Our name Barnabas Jones. Sally Smith. Or O'Shea. You're off to a great place.
[time=1119] Today is your day. Heaven is waiting so.
[time=1123] Live like it today.
[time=1127] Well done. Well done. It was just a couple months ago that our high school put on a spring musical
[time=1138] called "Susical the Musical." And we were in a meeting recently trying to figure out a way how to maybe even do something that our kids in the room could connect with to help them better understand some of the truths about Heaven that we're touching on in our series. And I'm really grateful for their efforts.
[time=1155] I don't know who all that was. I know a few of them. I know it was a few from the cast and a few from our drama team, but give them a big hand again for the work.
[time=1165] If you followed along there, and I hope you did, one of the clear implications was
[time=1175] how we live in light of the reality of Heaven.
[time=1181] And we'll come back to more of this in the days to come, but let me if I can just read for you from Colossians chapter 3. It says in Colossians chapter 3 verse 1, "Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, if you're here in the room and you know Him, if you're here in the room today and you have fully surrendered your heart and life to Him, if you are a Christ follower." Paul says here to the church at Corinth, the church at Colossae, excuse me, "keep seeking the things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind in the every day of your life, in the every day of your work, in the every day of your education, in the every day of your life at home, in the every day of your involvement with your team, in the every day of you doing whatever it is you do, wherever it is you do it. Have the reality of Heaven.
[time=1236] Have that be something that allows you to set your mind, verse 2, set your mind on the things above to value those things, to prioritize those things, not on the things that are on Earth for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. Like I said, we'll come back to that concept even more so in the days to come as we continue on in this series. It is a series that we have entitled "Harpes, Clouds and Angels." I think you can see it there. "Harpes, clouds and angels, or is there more?" When you think about Heaven what comes to mind, again so many of us for so long have had pictures or notions of Heaven and eternity that as we've thought about it, as we've kind of put those notions out on the table and then as we've started to actually look through and study the Scriptures we realize that oftentimes those pictures that we've had are a bit misconstrued. A couple weeks ago actually it's been three weeks since we were last really in our series.
[time=1304] I want to thank Mitchell Cruz for being here that Sunday that we were in Nairobi. I'm so thankful for his ongoing commitment to this ministry and his willingness to teach and I'm thankful for last Sunday and the chance you gave me to kind of catch all of you up on what God did and showed us during our time in Kenya. But I want to take you back to where we left off in our series and where we left off was a discussion. The message title that morning was Heaven A and Heaven B and we got a lot of feedback and a lot of great questions and comments from that and really there was I think a central statement that was made in that last message that we gave you on this Heaven series but I think caused a lot of people to kind of sit up and take notice and give some thought to this. And I think the question I think the statement, excuse me, really allowed all of us to come to grips with the fact that for the most part we really haven't thought this through to the degree that we probably need to and the statement was simply this, the place that you go when you die, some of you may remember this, the place that you go when you die will not be the place where you will spend eternity. The place that you go when you die, see most of us have been taught this, most of us have been told this and if we haven't been taught or told this we've just kind of assumed that the place that we go when we die will be the place that we spend all of eternity. And while the scriptures are clear that at the point of physical death genuine believers, true followers of Christ, will be with the Lord in Heaven immediately instantaneously the scriptures are also very clear that after that, after that being united with Christ in Heaven at the end of our life, there will come at time when at the end of God's redemptive dealings with man and earth, when everything has been culminated, when the rapture has transpired, when the millennial reign has ended at the end of the great white judgment, when Satan and his legions and all of those who have rejected Christ are finally judged. At the end of it all, the scriptures are so very clear that God creates and unfolds for His people a new Heaven, not the same Heaven, a new Heaven and a new earth, a new place where He will dwell in the people with the people of God for all of eternity. And let me read for you again Revelation 21 verses 1 to 5. Can I do that and would you in honor of God's Word, would you stand?
[time=1465] And let's just remind ourselves of this great vision that God gave, the Apostle John, Revelation 21 verse 1, here is what God allowed him to see.
[time=1477] Here is what transpires. Then I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven that place you and I go when we die, for the first Heaven and the first Earth, this Earth that you and I are standing on right now as we speak, for the first Heaven and the first Earth passed away.
[time=1501] Everybody say that phrase, "passed away." And there is no longer any sea. In verse 2 he goes on to say, "And then I saw the holy city." Here comes the new Jerusalem, which is another message for another Sunday that we'll get to.
[time=1517] It's a fascinating, amazing study of this new Jerusalem, this capital of worship that God brings to the new Earth. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God, made ready as a bride, adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and he God will dwell among them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be among them." It isn't in the end that we will be with him so much, it is the picture of God coming to be with us.
[time=1561] God comes down to dwell, and he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will no longer be any death, there will no longer be any morning, there will no longer be any crying or pain.
[time=1573] The first things have, everybody say it out loud, passed away. In verse 5, "And he who sits on the throne said, 'Behold.'" Look at this, "Behold, I am making all things." How many things?
[time=1589] Say it, "All things what?" Say it, new.
[time=1593] And he said, "Right, for these words are faithful and true." Father, God, we stand before you this morning anticipating and looking forward to what you and your great truth would have for us. Father, God, we admit that we are both curious and fearful at times of what eternity might hold. We would also readily say that we know there is no way we can know everything, but God, we are challenged and encouraged in our hearts recently, realizing that maybe there are some truths about heaven that you've had here for us all along that so many of us possibly haven't ever really grasped or understood.
[time=1637] God allow us the privilege of doing so. Help us in that direction this morning in your son's name we pray. Amen. You can be seated.
[time=1645] Well, we touched last time three weeks ago as I mentioned on the, what we called the intermediate heaven, that first heaven. And this morning I want us to turn our attention to the future and final heaven, if you will, the place that we will spend forever. What God in His word calls a new earth. Write that down this morning if you're taking notes. Some time to consider the new earth our final eternal resting place. You know, it's been interesting as I've studied and read and prepared for this series. Many of the books that I've looked at and many of the articles that I've studied in preparation for our times together say nothing at all about a new earth. Nothing.
[time=1693] No emphasis on it, no mention of it, no clarification on it. On rare occasions you might find a few paragraphs here or there vaguely addressing the issue, but if something is said about the new earth it's usually done in a way that undercuts and minishes an accurate picture of a redeemed and restored planet earth, which according to author Anthony Hakama, author of one of the books I've been working my way through, Anthony Hakama says this is a very dangerous notion. He says and I quote, "To leave the new earth out of our heavenly discussion when thinking about the final state of believers is to greatly impoverish our biblical teaching about the life that is to come." And so this morning if I can I want to just try and ask two questions. Probably a lot more questions on your mind. I know many more than two on my own, but this morning two questions that I hope as you think about this with me this idea of our final resting place being a new earth. Some questions about that that I hope will give you some insights that I hope will encourage you. And the first question is one I hear asked often. It's one that I've come across in my readings often and it's basically as it relates to the new earth basically is it an actual place. People still have in their minds this spiritualized picture of heaven. And so they ask and many of you are asking these days, is it an actual place? Is where will spend eternity?
[time=1789] Not where will go when we die, but now we're into the final realm. Now we're asking is the place that we will spend eternity an actual place.
[time=1801] I knew a man who would always say this. I'll never forget it. He always said, "Heaven was a spiritual condition, not a spiritual location." See I grew up hearing this. Maybe you did as well.
[time=1813] That heaven was a spiritual condition, not necessarily a spiritual location. Many people over the years have been prone to spiritualizing what the Bible teaches about heaven.
[time=1825] Here you go. This is a quote from a book that I read just a few weeks ago. This is a quote from a book that was written in essence to help people better understand what heaven would be like. And from this book written in an effort to help people better understand what heaven would be like, I give you this.
[time=1845] "Heaven is simply and only," this author says, "heaven is simply and only the aura of God. God's presence that permeates and intersects with our spiritual beings as we transcendently exist in the spiritual dimensions of his great and luminous glory." End quote.
[time=1865] Anybody want to go? And you might say, "Yeah, I do." And I understand there's parts of that that kind of caught my heart and my attention. I don't mean to discount it completely, but come on, permeating intersections of spiritual beings and the aura of God.
[time=1885] If heaven is only an aura, why?
[time=1889] Why, for instance, is Abraham, what does it say about Abraham in Hebrews 1110 that he was looking forward to? What?
[time=1897] To a city. Why? Why would it say later in Hebrews 1116 that heaven is described as a country? And you know what, my friends?
[time=1909] Jesus himself didn't seem to believe that heaven would only be a spiritual or ethereal place of transcendent beings connecting in luminous glory because Jesus himself spoke of a house with many rooms in which he was going to prepare for you a what?
[time=1929] A place. Everybody say it out loud. Oh what?
[time=1933] Thank you very much. A place.
[time=1937] Why could this be so confusing for so many of us? Why even early on here this morning in this discussion might there be many in the room already starting to kind of scratch your heads and wonder now, how does all this fit?
[time=1953] Well, here's a quote from a, I just put down, I made the quote up, but I just put it at the bottom. It's from a hundred different people in your past and mine. And here's the quote, we've heard it our whole lives.
[time=1965] This is why it's so confusing I think. There is nothing we've been told.
[time=1969] There is nothing about our present experience here on earth that could ever suggest to us what heaven will really be like if you've ever heard anything like that. Raise your hand.
[time=1981] Of course. So many of us grew up. You had that Sunday school teacher, didn't you? You had that grandmother well-intending good people. But again, I think when it all kind of gets down to the end here, I think what I begin to realize is there is so much here that I just never really looked at and never took the time to try and piece together. The bottom line is that most of us, see if you agree with this, most of us based on what we've been told and taught have come to expect a non-earth rather than a what? Rather than a new earth. When in actuality a reading of Revelation 21 and 22 and you can write that down. Why don't you write that down? Read Revelation 21 and 22. Read it this afternoon. Read it this evening with your family.
[time=2029] Read it as a small group this week. Read it with your class next Sunday morning.
[time=2033] Just a reading of Revelation 21 and 22 depicts and describes a new earth with atmosphere, with mountains, with water, with trees, with people, with homes, with cities, and streets. The biblical doctrine of the new earth implies a principle that is for many startling. One author said it this way. If you want to know what the ultimate heaven, our eternal home will be like. Anybody want to know? The best place he says, the best place to start is by looking around us.
[time=2069] See at that point right there, many in the room go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, it can't be.
[time=2077] We shouldn't close our eyes and try to imagine the unimaginable. We should open our eyes instead to all that is around us and the glorious thought, and it is a glorious thought, of it all being perfected and restored once again. Think about that just for a moment. Try and get your arms. The arms of your mind around a new earth.
[time=2105] An animal kingdom restored, no pollution, no ecological deficiencies, no natural disasters, no drought, no famine, no terror, no destruction, no disease, no accidents, only harmony, peace, kindness, unity, love, devotion, worship, God-honoring, living, enjoyment of nature, people and creation here in a perfected, restored, new earth. So I think the answer to that first question, I understand the answer to that first question to be yes. It is a very real place, this new earth. And secondly, let me just pose this question to you. I want to make sure you know the answer to this. Why?
[time=2153] Why is it so important? And you could even add this, why is it so important to me personally as your pastor and as one who gets to stand in this place and communicate these things to you?
[time=2165] Why would it be so important to me that you would see that the real place is the old earth made new? Why? Why would that be so important?
[time=2177] I'll tell you the answer and then we'll talk about it because I believe our view of God's redeeming nature.
[time=2185] I believe our view of God's character, our view of God's attributes. And in this case, our view of God's redeeming nature is at stake. And I want you to have a proper view of God's redeeming nature.
[time=2201] I want you to have a view of God. I want your theology, your spiritual thinking, if you will, on these issues to reflect in a consistent way with the nature and makeup of our God, it's important that we see this question in the bigger picture of God's redemptive activity.
[time=2221] This new earth discussion needs to be seen in the broader scope of God's redeeming activity.
[time=2229] Redemption, write that word down. We've talked about it many times in the past.
[time=2233] Let me remind you of its meaning. Redemption means to buy back. It means the word in and of itself gives you the picture that there was a time when something was here. Somehow, some way, that something that was there now ends up over here and it's not in a good spot and to redeem it is to buy it back. It means literally to buy freedom. Something was free, something ended up in bondage, and now redemption is what brings it back to freedom.
[time=2265] Redemption means to buy back, to buy free, to literally take someone or something that is in bondage, to take that which is oppressed and to bring freedom.
[time=2277] Mankind, and see, here's where we go with this. So oftentimes in this discussion of redemption, you and I are easily tracking with that picture if what we're talking about is you.
[time=2289] If what we're talking about is me. If we're talking about God's redeeming work, the redemption that takes place in the life of a human being who he saves, that's one thing, but now this morning my friends, I invite you to consider that redemptive work with this planet, with this earth, which Revelation 21 says the first one passes away and he creates it anew. The entire physical, just back up a moment here, okay? Let's just do a really quick history lesson. The entire physical universe, man, creation, animals, nature, the entire physical universe was originally created for God's glory and without sin. Correct? Amen? Okay, good.
[time=2341] And as most of you know, with the sin and rebellion of mankind, both man and creation fell under the weight of sin's curse. You and I, most of us in the room know that the moment Eve took the fruit and eight of it, and the moment she gave that fruit to Adam who was there and he ate of it, you and I know that when sin enters the picture, not only is the relationship between Adam and Eve, not only is the relationship between mankind and God severed, but at that moment what God had created in creation is severed. At that moment everything goes south. At that moment all of a sudden you have a universe and creation, yes mankind, but a universe in creation which is completely and severely broken.
[time=2393] But God's plans were not thwarted by this. Be reminded of that this morning.
[time=2401] God was not taken by surprise. He had prepared a plan by which he would redeem all men and all creation. Just as he promises to make us new, he promises as well to make the earth new.
[time=2417] Isaiah 65, 17. Write that down.
[time=2421] Isaiah 65, 17. For behold, Isaiah says the great prophet of God, I create new heavens.
[time=2429] For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things will not be remembered or even come to mind. He says in Isaiah 66, 22.
[time=2441] Write that down. Isaiah 66, 22. For just as the new heavens and the new earth which I make will endure before me, declares the Lord, so your offspring and your name will endure. They're speaking of a new earth that will endure.
[time=2457] 2 Peter 3, 13. We could go on and on.
[time=2461] These are just a few. 2 Peter 3, 13. But according to his promise, Peter says here, but according to his promise, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. The biblical record, my friends, the biblical record.
[time=2485] What's the biblical record? It's the Word of God. I believe with the real clarity in my own heart these days that the biblical record shows that God never has and never will give up on his original creation. You know as you think about it, and as I've thought about it in recent weeks, here's just a sampling of words that God uses when describing his present watch this. When God talks about his present and his future intentions for mankind and creation.
[time=2517] When you go to the Scriptures and you begin to study the words that God uses when talking about his present and future intentions for mankind and the earth, here are the words, here are the words that he uses, reconcile, redeem, restore, recover, return, renew, regenerate, resurrect, renew, rebuild.
[time=2553] I put some of you to sleep, reconcile, redeem, restore, recover, return, renew, regenerate, resurrect, rescue, rebuild each of these words. In the original language, as well as the vernacular of our own day, clearly imply a return to an original condition.
[time=2573] And I don't want you to miss that. A return to an original condition that was ruined, a condition that was ruined or lost, for whatever reasons, what these words clearly communicate is that God always sees you and me in light of what he intended us to be, and he always seeks to restore us to that original design. It is the exact same approach with the earth. He seeks to restore earth to its original design. One of the great authors I've come across on this topic, the Albert Walters, W-O-L-T-E-R-S, Albert Walters in his book Creation Regained, says, "Listen, God hangs on to his fallen original creation and salvages it." I love that phrase.
[time=2621] He refuses to abandon the work of his hands. In fact, he sacrifices his own son to save his original project, Humankind, which has botched original assignment, and all of the earth, along with it, is given another chance in Christ. The original is to be in the end restored.
[time=2645] Now, for many of you in the room this morning, myself included, this is a new concept. Many of you, like me, when thinking about the eternal heaven or new earth, never have fought in terms of renewal and restoration. We think about redeemed or resurrected people, but not a redeemed or resurrected earth. Personally, based upon what I had been taught, personally based upon what I had studied over the years, I always thought God was going to destroy and utterly annihilate the earth, gone forever, abandoning his original creation and design, and starting over by implementing a new plan in a non unearth-like heaven. That's what I always thought. I want to read to you from Randy Alcorn's book.
[time=2697] I've mentioned this to you a couple times. I think they told me this morning it's even available out in the bookstore, Heaven, by Randy Alcorn, a phenomenal, insightful, interesting read.
[time=2709] Let me read this to you. Alcorn says, he asked the question, what lies behind?
[time=2713] What is it that lies behind this notion that so many of us have that God is going to destroy the earth and be done with it?
[time=2721] He says, I believe it's weak theology. I believe it's a weak theology of God, though we'd never say it this way. We see him as a thwarted inventor whose creation failed.
[time=2733] Having realized the mistake, he'll end up trashing most of what he made. His consolation for a failed earth is that he rescues a few of us from the fire, but this idea is emphatically refuted by Scripture. God has a magnificent plan and he will not surrender earth to the trash heap.
[time=2757] Let me ask you this, will the earth as we know it, my friends?
[time=2761] It's important that we make this distinction. Will the earth as we know it today come to an end? Absolutely. The earth, as you and I know it today, the earth and all it entails, the earth and all that's here, the earth, as you and I know it will come too. And I believe, 2 Peter 3 says, a fiery end. There will be a fire.
[time=2781] And it will be consuming. And the earth, as you and I know it, will come to an end. To a final end?
[time=2789] I don't think so. I don't believe so. Revelation 21 says it will pass away. Remember I had you, I had you noticed that phrase, it was used a couple of times there. Revelation 21 says it will pass away. When people pass away, let me ask you something.
[time=2805] Do they cease to exist? Yes or no?
[time=2809] Didn't hear you? No.
[time=2813] The verbiage there is important. When people pass away, we're talking about people in creation, always in the biblical record, always inextricably linked. People in creation, the creation of God, people of the universe, when people pass away, do they cease to exist as people will be raised to a new people.
[time=2833] So too the earth will be raised, I believe, to a new earth. To a new and glorious earth.
[time=2841] Turn in your Bibles if you were to Acts chapter 3.
[time=2845] I want to just kind of have you trace back through a statement that's made. I want to kind of show you the origins of that. Go to Acts chapter 3. Peter here in what is one of the most amazing sermons ever given in Acts 3. And we're going to pick it up verse 19. This is interesting.
[time=2869] Follow this, would you? Therefore Peter here preaching in Solomon's portico says, "Therefore repent," he says to the people, "repent and return so that your sins may be wiped away in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send Jesus the Christ appointed for you, whom heaven," verse 21, "whom heaven must receive until the period of," what's your Bible say?
[time=2905] Mine's his restoration. "whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration," the restoration of how many things? "of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets," how's Isaiah for you?
[time=2925] We've already been there this morning, right? "whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration, of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from ancient time." Now I want to just show you where I believe Peter gets this notion of all things being restored, all things being redeemed. Peter spent a lot of time with a great rabbi whose name was what? Jesus.
[time=2953] And I want you to turn back to Matthew 19. Just do that real quick.
[time=2957] Go back to Matthew. First book in your New Testament there. Go to Matthew 19.
[time=2961] 27 and 28.
[time=2967] Matthew 19.
[time=2973] Verses 27 and 28. Here we have Peter in direct conversation with the Lord.
[time=2979] Then Peter, classic Peter, says to the Lord. Then Peter said to him, "Behold,
[time=2985] we have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?" And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you that you who have followed me in the regeneration." Interesting. "You who have followed me in the time of the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne some translations would read restoration. Truly I say to you that you who have followed me in the time of restoration in the time of regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne you also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel." You know what my friends? He didn't say after the time of destruction.
[time=3033] He doesn't say after the time of annihilation.
[time=3037] It doesn't say after the time of abandonment of all things. No, he talks about a time of regeneration.
[time=3045] A time of restoration where all things you, me, the earth all of creation gets made new.
[time=3057] Heaven on earth a restored and renewed earth and this is no this is no small point that we make here. Al Corn in his book Heaven goes to great lengths to communicate this. He says this is no small semantic point. It draws a line in the sand between two fundamentally different theologies. Mankind was designed to live on the earth to God's glory. That's exactly what Christ's incarnation his death and his resurrection secured. A renewed humanity upon a renewed earth. Jesus He explicitly said all things would be renewed and the word palagensia watch this in that Matthew 19 passage I just took you to where it says in this time of restoration or regeneration at the end when God sits on the throne the word there for regeneration is palagensia it's translated regenerate in Matthew 19-28 it comes from two words which together mean new Genesis or coming back from death to life. When Jesus said that all things would be renewed the disciples would have understood him to mean all things that were part of the only lives they knew the lives they lived on earth apart from those aspects of our present earthly lives that are inherently sinful or are fulfilled by a greater reality all things appears to be comprehensive. You, me the earth creation all of it made completely new for his glory to be enjoyed by his people an eternal relationship with him and each other. Here's the best picture I can give you on this and it's pretty simple you know me I'm pretty simple but here's what comes to my mind. Where we live Kebronai and the kids we live out out Tonkel Road a ways and we just live on just a little bit of property and our house is surrounded on our property our house is surrounded by and it's kind of cool I like it I think it looks great there's these kind of these randomly placed patches of wild grass and flowers and when they're like in full bloom it's just really really kind of cool and I realized and this was kind of new you know for a kid from California when I came to Indiana and when we moved out there I kind of watched my neighbors and my neighbors had these wild grass patches and parts of their properties that would in the fall, gosh is it the fall? Yeah I think it's the fall I get confused sorry. I think it's the fall when it all kind of starts to get brown and dead well I noticed these guys going out and they burn it and I'm thinking wow I get to play with matches this is kind of cool kids don't do this at home so I figured I would get I get to go I pick a windy day right you pick a windy day when it's just going to get really hot and blazing and you go out there and you have my flip flops and my gym shorts and my T-shirt and I start popping matches in dry grass and I'm telling you it was an absolute kick it has been for about five years I do it every fall it's one of the best days you know in the whole year for me and I just I noticed you know after doing it a few times how you know when I get done you know and I think it made the neighbors a little nervous a few times because I may have appeared to not have known what I was doing but I had it all in control I had a rake I had a rake alright just in case anybody's wondering I had a rake and man these things would just burn these patches you know when the wind would come and the flames would shoot up my kids are going crazy we're taking pictures you know here's the deal at the end of the day you go stay on the porch and you look out at all these burned patches and they're just dark and they're just black and soot and a little smoke coming up you know what I mean ugly ugly gone like just devastated just wiped out and then um and then April comes you with me today right now if you go to my house all those patches just huge just green flowers and grass I believe God's going to scorch this place I believe what 2 Peter 3 says I don't believe that means it's over I think he will renew it I think it will get this will get green again and I think we'll live in the newness and the freshness of a restored earth forever with a God who has come to dwell amen let's pray Father God thank you for that great promise and thank you for the reality for some of us it's a new thought a renewed Fort Wayne a renewed a renewed globe a renewed and restored and redeemed planet that is as you originally intended it to be and God we would be able to enjoy that and see that oh God I pray that we would leave this place today not so much consumed with maybe some new learning but oh God I pray that we would leave consumed with the faces and the hearts of those that we know that today would be on the outside looking in that today would be outside of relationship with you and God if it stays that way people who would be unable by their rejection of you to experience that heavenly dwelling with you immediately following death for however long that will last and then God the inability to experience this eternal dwelling here on earth with you as you come to dwell in rule and reign may we be mindful of that truth may we think of them may we open our mouths may we serve may we love may we extend ourselves as Christ followers would to those who are in need inviting them by those very actions to a forever with you in your son's name we pray amen
