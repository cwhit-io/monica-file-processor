[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all news, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=58] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I'm so thankful
[time=66] that you've tuned into the broadcast this week.
[time=68] We are so grateful for this time and so thankful for the opportunity that God gives us here
[time=74] in this setting to share this ministry with you.
[time=77] We consider you a part of the Black Hawk family, and we are so thankful to get to have this time together.
[time=82] I want to tell you about something that's happened over the last couple, two, three weeks.
[time=87] And this happens, I think, kind of on a cyclical basis.
[time=90] There will just be seasons of time where I'll personally see this happen, where our team
[time=96] here at Black Hawk will see this take place.
[time=98] I keep bumping into people.
[time=100] I keep having the chance and the privilege of meeting people who are new to Black Hawk, and they are not only new to Black Hawk, but they came to Black Hawk because of the broadcast, because of this Bible Hour broadcast.
[time=113] People who have been watching for maybe two, three, four, five months, I met a gal and her kids last week who had been watching for two years, and finally decided to just get up
[time=124] and come and be a part of it live and in person.
[time=127] Got an email from somebody last week who had been watching for three years, and their life hit an enormous crisis point, and it was that crisis point that I think God used
[time=138] to bring them not just to the broadcast, but then eventually to this place and these people
[time=144] live and in person on a Sunday morning, and they were so thankful that they came.
[time=149] So I want to just invite you, again, I do this periodically, if you've been watching, if this is, in essence, kind of your church home, if this is something that you've grown accustomed to, if you feel like we've got somewhat of a relationship, we would love to see that relationship further.
[time=165] I want to just invite you to come any Sunday morning, nine, or 1045.
[time=169] We also have a common ground worship service, teaching time on Wednesday evenings at 645.
[time=176] We would love to meet you.
[time=178] We would love to have this friendship progress, and we would love to come alongside you in whatever ways we can.
[time=184] I'm so thankful for the privilege that God's given me to be able to speak His truth into
[time=191] your life, and I could think of nothing better than to be able to do that with you face to face on a Sunday morning.
[time=198] Thank you for tuning in, and just know there's a whole family here at Blackhawk that would love to meet you someday.
[time=204] So come and be with us.
[time=206] Have a great rest of your week, and thank you so much for tuning in, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=216] [MUSIC]
[time=244] Praise us, say your God's own Son.
[time=251] Reisen reigning Lord, sustain your love, the universe, by the power of your world.
[time=273] O great God, be glorified, our life's laid down, the world's magnified.
[time=288] O great God, be lifted high.
[time=298] There is none by you.
[time=318] When we see your master's face, in speeches, all will stand.
[time=346] O great God, be glorified, our life's laid down, the world's magnified.
[time=376] O great God, be lifted high.
[time=389] There is none by you.
[time=406] There is none, there is none by you.
[time=427] There is none by you.
[time=437] I've been talking to you about this.
[time=442] We've seen some of you respond.
[time=444] We'd love to see more of you.
[time=446] Every year we have the summit here, the leadership summit, it's a great opportunity for everybody
[time=452] that calls Black Hawk home to come and to take part in this with us.
[time=456] It will challenge you, it will encourage you, it will inspire you, and even if you're not a corporate leader, even if you're not the leader of a ministry, even if you're not coaching a team, if you just, like most of us do, have the chance to, in living out your faith, influence
[time=471] others, you'll be encouraged by what you see at the summit.
[time=475] Somebody asked me about what it's like to actually be there, we'll hear in this room, it's a live via satellite simulcast from over in Chicago at Willow Creek Community Church and it is a great experience.
[time=486] Here's just two snippets for you.
[time=489] Some of the opportunities that we've had come our way through our participation in the summit.
[time=495] A couple of just quick snippets.
[time=496] One, the first one I believe from an interview Bill Heibels did last year with Bono.
[time=503] As most of you know, has a real deep devotion in his heart to those in need.
[time=509] Bono has, I believe, a growing understanding of God and where God fits in this whole compassion
[time=515] ministry circle and it was a great interview.
[time=518] Bono, I think this clip begins with actually some concert footage of him singing a song.
[time=523] He says one of his favorites, a song taken right from Psalm 40 where it talks about singing
[time=529] a new song, you'll see a clip from Bono and then a Rick Warren clip, all having to do with the leadership summit this August.
[time=559] A real spiritual activity that began in you in an accelerated way came through your involvement
[time=570] in a kind of youth group that you and a couple of the other members of the band got involved
[time=576] in and you started studying the scriptures and you really got into it quite a bit in those days.
[time=582] I never had any problems with Christ but Christians were always a bit of a problem for me and
[time=591] I used to avoid them if I could.
[time=594] I found them always to be completely disinterested, culturally, politically.
[time=600] I found it very hard to relax with them.
[time=605] They seemed strange to me.
[time=607] I'm sure I was strange to them.
[time=610] And yet, through all of this, I met in school, I met some people who knew the scriptures.
[time=618] There was quite a moment there when people got very interested in the early church and
[time=626] the possibilities of imitating the early church.
[time=631] But Christians can be very judgmental on particularly the way people look, the way they carry on.
[time=638] They tend to judge people by surface problems, sexual immorality.
[time=644] These things are the preoccupation historically of the church whereas corporate greed or things
[time=651] like that will be never mentioned.
[time=653] I'm pretty sure that the universe operates by the laws of karma essentially and all physical
[time=662] laws do, and what you put out comes back against you, then enters the story of grace
[time=671] which really is the story of Christ and which turned this view of the universe upside down.
[time=681] It's completely counterintuitive, very, very hard for human beings to grasp grace.
[time=690] We can actually grasp atonement, revenge, fairness, all of this.
[time=695] We can grasp.
[time=696] But we don't grasp grace very well.
[time=699] I'm much more interested in grace because I'm really depending on us.
[time=704] Desperately needed.
[time=705] If I'm living by karma, I'm in big trouble.
[time=708] When God says to him, "I want you to lay down what's in your hand."
[time=715] Lay down your identity, lay down your income, and lay down your influence.
[time=726] If you do, Moses, I will make it come alive in ways you've never imagined.
[time=733] Every time you start to pick it up again, it's going to turn the wood.
[time=741] Think about this.
[time=745] In that moment on in the Bible, it is never again referred to as Moses' staff.
[time=751] Never again.
[time=753] From that point on, that staff is called the rod of God.
[time=760] It is the rod of God that Moses uses to split the Red Sea and they walk through.
[time=766] It is the rod of God that he touches the Nile River and it turns to blood.
[time=771] It is the rod of God that he hits the stone and it turns to water.
[time=774] It is the rod of God that he does the 10 miracles that let his people go after 400 years of slavery.
[time=783] God says, "Moses, if you'll give me what I've got, what you've got, whatever's in your
[time=790] hand, and if you will lay it down, you lay down your identity.
[time=797] It's no more about you, it's all about me.
[time=800] If you will lay down your income, it's not your money, it's mine," says the Lord.
[time=806] And if you will lay down your influence, it's not about your ego.
[time=812] It's about my plan and purpose in the world.
[time=814] If you lay that down, I will take something so simple, a piece of wood, and I will do miracles
[time=821] through it.

[time=868] No big deal, let us know.
[time=870] We'd love to cover that for you if we can and help you be a part of the summit.
[time=875] Well, hey, let me just, if I can, invite you back into this discussion that we've been in, this study that we've been in for several weeks now that we've entitled Heaven.
[time=886] Harps, clouds and angels, or is there more?
[time=891] Harps, clouds or angels, or is there more we're learning, I think, and we're discovering together that there is a great deal more than many of us ever imagined and I want to thank
[time=901] you for the emails that have been sent, the letters that have come in, the conversations that we've had.
[time=906] We're so very thankful for what we see God doing in you and in your mind and in your heart as we make our way through these truths.
[time=914] We've gotten a lot of questions that have come in and we're going to kind of take those questions and in the weeks to come dedicate a Sunday morning toward the end of the series to trying to practically answer as many of them as we can and I'm looking forward to that.
[time=928] If you've got more questions that come up, please feel free to keep asking.
[time=932] I want to just start this morning, if I can, by just sharing with you something that kind
[time=938] of has a little bit more to do with where we were last week.
[time=941] We spent a great deal of time talking about the reality of the new earth, the new earth,
[time=948] the scriptures are clear in Revelation that at the end of it all, God will create a new
[time=954] earth, a redeemed restored earth.
[time=957] There will be a new heaven and a new earth and something I didn't get to the last time that I want to just talk about before we jump into today's topic, which is going to be the new Jerusalem, which is going to be located on the new earth.
[time=971] I want to just go back to just a quick topic on the new earth and it's in Revelation 21-1.
[time=978] Would you open your Bibles and just go back to Revelation 21-1, if you will, I want to
[time=984] read this to you.
[time=986] Very first verse, we've read this passage almost each Sunday in the series and as we've
[time=992] read it, not purposefully, but we've always kind of glossed over this one statement that
[time=998] I want to make sure we at least talk about and give some thought to this morning.
[time=1001] I want you to see it and I want you with me to try to better understand its meaning.
[time=1007] Here it is, Revelation 21-1, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth."
[time=1015] John says, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and earth passed
[time=1021] away." And there is, now what does your Bible say and there is what?
[time=1026] There is no longer anyone.
[time=1029] See.
[time=1030] Have you ever thought about that?
[time=1033] Have you ever ever considered the significance of that?
[time=1038] Have you ever mentally just tried to imagine that?
[time=1042] Now again, I stand firm on what we concluded last week.
[time=1045] I believe what God has in mind and as I've read many authors and as I've looked at this
[time=1051] over the last couple of months, I feel in my heart convinced that what we're talking about here is a new earth, not a new earth, but a new earth, a redeemed earth.
[time=1061] This earth restored, made perfect, back to its original design.
[time=1069] And as John has this vision of what it will look like, he says, "I see a new heaven and
[time=1075] a new earth for the first heaven and first earth passed away and there is no longer any
[time=1082] sea." Now you don't, you know, like me, you don't have to be too bright, I mean, to just figure out that when you look at this planet, you know, you spin that globe, you know, in your family room or when you look at that map of the whole of the whole thing, any time you look at this globe, any time we see pictures of this planet, while there are definitely
[time=1107] these little blotches of land, it is filled with what, with water, with sea.
[time=1116] And I don't know, I don't know how you feel about this, I feel pretty good about it.
[time=1121] I've gotten, it's gotten better with me as I've gotten older.
[time=1123] How do you feel about flying over an ocean?
[time=1127] It's always been an interesting thing for me, I think when I was younger, the first time I ever took a trip across the ocean, I was scared to death.
[time=1135] I didn't want a, I didn't want a window seat, I didn't want to know where we were in the flight, I just wanted to once again feel those wheels hit the ground, right?
[time=1145] It was always a little nervous as I've gotten older, it's a little bit better, but I tell you what now, what makes it a little challenging for me is even recently, for instance, I thought about this going over to Kenya, you know, a few weeks ago.
[time=1156] Now when you get in the plane and you sit down, they've got these big TV screens and it shows you, right, it shows you your flight path.
[time=1164] And so here you are, this little dot over here on this little green thing of land and then the entire screen is like ocean and it shows you where you're going to go over here and land in Amsterdam and it's just kind of a unsettling deal, a lot of water in between
[time=1179] me and Kenya and then on the way back, same thing as well.
[time=1185] The scriptures say that in a perfectly restored earth, there will be none, no longer any sea.
[time=1194] And I wonder what that makes you think of.
[time=1196] I wonder in your mind, where do you go with that?
[time=1201] If I were to ask you to kind of give it your best shot on why, why do you think that's God's plan and His design?
[time=1209] I wonder where your mind goes.
[time=1212] I don't know the answer.
[time=1213] I'm not sure, you know, that we can just figure that one out for sure, you know, on this side of heaven, but I'll tell you what, as I've read and as I've looked into that issue and as I've studied that passage, you know, one thing that comes to my mind and obviously it's come to many individuals' minds because they've written about it.
[time=1232] And as I studied it, I found it to be very compelling and that is this.
[time=1236] In the new earth, in the reality of a perfectly redeemed earth with perfectly redeemed people
[time=1244] who are there to give perfect glory and honor to God.
[time=1249] In the end of it all, the absence of the sea allows there to be no longer any ethnic or
[time=1256] regional separation.
[time=1258] It's a long way to Africa, right?
[time=1261] It's a long way to New Zealand.
[time=1263] It's a long way to Hong Kong.
[time=1265] We've got these large bodies of water, what, separating us.
[time=1270] And in this new reality, in this place called the new earth, it's a really compelling thought
[time=1276] to just think that we will be able to get to them.
[time=1279] I don't know how we're going to get to them.
[time=1281] A kid wrote me last week and just begged me to tell him if we were going to be able to fly.
[time=1287] I don't know if we're going to be able to fly.
[time=1289] I don't know if we'll be able to fly.
[time=1291] I don't know if our cars will fly.
[time=1293] I don't know if it's back to the future and our skateboards will fly.
[time=1297] I don't know if we'll think it and we'll be there.
[time=1300] I have no idea about the whole travel issue, but I do know this.
[time=1305] I do know that from what God's Word says, it appears that there will be fewer and fewer barriers between us and the rest of the world.
[time=1316] And I want you to think about that, not just in terms of forever.
[time=1319] I want you to think about that reality, not just in terms of heaven, but I want you to think about that, my friends, today.
[time=1325] I know there's a notion between us and Kenya, and I know it's a long way from here to Hong
[time=1332] Kong.
[time=1333] I know that there's some distance, but I want you to realize that this sinfulness that God
[time=1339] is going to redeem, I want you to understand that this brokenness, that the new earth will
[time=1345] remedy.
[time=1346] I want you to know that it affects you and I in the everyday of our life.
[time=1349] There are barriers that we've allowed to exist between you and I and those across the street.
[time=1356] There are barriers.
[time=1358] There's distance and separation between you and I and those of other ethnicities and colors.
[time=1364] There's struggles that you and I sometimes have with those who don't make as much as we do or live like we do or drive what we drive.
[time=1371] There are times when in your reality and mind here in this broken world where we have allowed
[time=1378] the enemy's division to come and separate those that should be and could be united.
[time=1384] And in that uniting, you and I could have a chance to magnify him.
[time=1390] You and I could have an opportunity to represent him.
[time=1393] You and I can be priests when barriers are moved through.
[time=1396] I'm thankful for the opportunity he gives you and I to move through those barriers today.
[time=1401] There will be a day geographically.
[time=1404] Somebody pointed this out to me after first hour.
[time=1406] Think about it.
[time=1407] No more seas means the continents which were at one time what?
[time=1411] In the original design, we know the continents were just geographically as far as the geology goes, the continents were together.
[time=1419] Now no more seas that again paints a great picture of a restored planet back to its original
[time=1426] design.
[time=1427] No more ethnic, no more regional separation.
[time=1431] Everything separating us.
[time=1433] Quite a picture.
[time=1435] Revelation 21, 1, no more seas.
[time=1438] Well, let's jump from the new earth to our topic this morning.
[time=1444] On the new earth, which I believe is the old earth made new, scripture paints a very
[time=1450] clear picture of an additional and extremely important piece of the heavenly puzzle.
[time=1457] That very important piece of the heavenly puzzle is what God's word calls and you can write this down.
[time=1462] The new Jerusalem, the new Jerusalem, again, not a new Jerusalem, but a new Jerusalem.
[time=1471] Just like with the new earth, this is the holy city.
[time=1474] This is Jerusalem itself made new.
[time=1477] This is Jerusalem restored.
[time=1479] This is a perfect Jerusalem.
[time=1482] The new Jerusalem is going to be the city at the center of the future and final heaven.
[time=1487] It is the worship capital, if you will, an eternal throne room of God here on the new
[time=1493] earth.
[time=1494] And while scripture does paint a picture of people coming and going, think about that, people coming and going and we'll talk about that in a moment, it will definitely be the new Jerusalem.
[time=1505] It will definitely be without question the focal point and hub of all heavenly activity.
[time=1512] It will be amazing.
[time=1514] How amazing.
[time=1516] Let me just show you this.
[time=1517] How amazing.
[time=1518] How amazing will it be?
[time=1520] How wonderful will it be?
[time=1521] How captivating will it be?
[time=1523] How much will it just blow you an eye away?
[time=1527] How incredible is this going to be for you?
[time=1531] Sometimes again, as I continue to talk with people, as I continue to get emails while this study is helping them in some ways, there is still, I think, in many of us, sometimes
[time=1541] the difficulty, the challenge of kind of trying to kind of understand really how enormous
[time=1547] and how magnificent this is really going to be.
[time=1552] And I want to just take you back to a passage that we were looking at just a week or so ago.
[time=1557] And again, we kind of, we look at the passage for a certain purpose, but we kind of glossed over something that I don't want us to gloss over this morning.
[time=1566] Turn in your Bibles to Isaiah 65, would you?
[time=1568] Isaiah 65 verses 17, 18 and 19 here, God, through the prophet, Isaiah speaks specifically
[time=1577] about the new heavens and the new earth, and he even addresses this issue of the new Jerusalem,
[time=1584] but there is a phrase that he uses that I want you to kind of give some thought to this morning.
[time=1589] Let's look at the passage, Isaiah 65, 17, you see it there, for behold, God says, I create
[time=1596] new heavens and a new earth, and the former things will not be remembered or come to mind.
[time=1606] And in 18 he says, but be glad and rejoice forever in what I create.
[time=1611] For behold, I create Jerusalem for rejoicing and her people for gladness, that's what will
[time=1618] go on in the New Jerusalem, rejoicing and gladness.
[time=1621] Verse 19 says, I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in my people, and there will no
[time=1628] longer be heard in her in the New Jerusalem, the voice of weeping and the sound of crying,
[time=1636] a great picture of what he will create in the end, a new earth and a new Jerusalem.
[time=1641] I want you to go back though to that phrase in verse 17, go back to 17 and look at this with me, and I want you just to try again to just mentally and emotionally put your arms around this concept.
[time=1653] It says, I will create new heavens and a new earth and the former things, the former things
[time=1660] that phrase refers back to the old earth, that phrase, the former things, refers back
[time=1666] to where you and I live today.
[time=1669] And it says, the former things will not be remembered or second phrase, come to mind.
[time=1677] He purposefully, God purposefully right there in just this small verse, he purposefully at
[time=1683] the end separates those two phrases.
[time=1686] And I believe he does so with great intent and here's what I learned as I studied those two phrases.
[time=1693] Think about the most amazing physical, natural created site location, think about the most
[time=1704] amazing place you've ever been on this planet.
[time=1710] I mean think about, I don't know where you've traveled, I don't know all of what you've seen, I don't know all the places you've gone but there's got to be a time and a place where you traveled somewhere or went somewhere on a vacation and you came upon this site,
[time=1725] this site, this natural place of beauty and awesome, majestic, you could see the creating
[time=1733] hand of God, I mean maybe it was the Grand Canyon, anybody ever been to the Grand Canyon?
[time=1739] Raise your hand.
[time=1740] Maybe that's what came to your mind.
[time=1743] Others have traveled to the great wall of China.
[time=1745] Others have gone to the deserts of Africa, I mean there's people in here who have seen incredible physical beauty, incredible, incredible physical awe, I mean just things that blew
[time=1757] you away and you've all, all of you have said and I have said it, I have said walking away from the edge of the Grand Canyon, that is something I'll never what?
[time=1768] Fail out or forget and God's word says that what you will encounter and what you will
[time=1778] see, what you will experience on the new earth and in this new heaven, this place called
[time=1786] the New Jerusalem, he says when you see it and when you experience it, you will forget
[time=1797] not just forget the phrase there and the former things will not be remembered.
[time=1803] That phrase there in the original language that carries the idea of a situation where you and I would be focused on this, we would know this, we would have this, we would be
[time=1814] experiencing this and then all of a sudden this comes and then when we look at the two
[time=1820] we go you know what I'm going to choose this, now this is better, now I like this and that all makes sense to you and I, I mean we, the former things will not be remembered, I move from this to this, but come on, how many of you as you have made that choice and you
[time=1835] and I have made it a thousand times, though we've chosen something new, how about that second phrase, nor will it ever even come to mind.
[time=1847] This choice, the shift of focus, the being just taken back by this, not only will it
[time=1855] shift your focus, you won't even be, the word literally in the Greek talks about, I mean it's literally as if it were describing abnesia, you won't even be able to remember, it will
[time=1867] be that overwhelming, it will be that magnificent, it will be that significant, a shift and a
[time=1875] change in our experience.
[time=1881] Pretty awesome, don't forget that Isaiah 65-17, as he talks about the grandeur and the beauty
[time=1887] and the impact of what he will someday create for you and I to live in and experience.
[time=1893] Okay back to the new Jerusalem, let's talk a little bit about that this morning, can we,
[time=1899] I want to start just by relaying to you and I'm so thankful that the Scriptures do this
[time=1905] because they actually give you and I for this discussion, they actually give you the physical dimensions of the new Jerusalem, some of you know that others of you maybe didn't, but this new Jerusalem, this capital city, this central place of worship where the throne
[time=1920] of God will exist, where God will come and dwell among his people, actually will exist
[time=1926] on the new earth, the new Jerusalem it says will come down, and this new Jerusalem is
[time=1932] an unbelievable, it's a spectacular sight and reality.
[time=1938] Revelation 21, I want to just, I want to just take you if I can, Revelation 21, let's start in verse 15, can we, go to 21-15 and let me just, let me read this to you.
[time=1953] Revelation 21 verse 15, we'll start there, let me just read this to you and as you read
[time=1959] do your very best to imagine, I mean just do your very best to envision what this is communicating
[time=1965] and then we'll talk about it for a little bit, actual dimensions, here we go, the one who spoke with me, John again in this vision that he has God allowing him to see all of these future realities, John says verse 15, the one who spoke with me had a gold measuring
[time=1981] rod to measure the city, John here is in the presence of an angel who has a gold measuring
[time=1989] rod to measure the city and its gates and its wall, we have a real city with real gates
[time=1997] and real walls, the city verse 16 is laid out as a square and its length is as great
[time=2005] as the width and he measured the city with the rod 1500 miles, 1500 miles its length and
[time=2016] width and height, you with me, 1500, it's a cube, 1500 miles with its length, its width
[time=2027] and its height all being equal and he measured its wall 72 yards according to human measurements
[time=2035] which are also angelic measurements, the material of the wall was jasper and the city was pure
[time=2043] gold like clear glass that pure, verse 19, the foundation stones of the city wall were
[time=2051] adorned with every kind of precious stone, the first foundation stone was jasper, the
[time=2057] second sapphire, the third calcedoni, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonics, the sixth
[time=2065] sardius, the seventh chrystallite, the eighth barrel, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrystal
[time=2071] praise, there's a class in seminary, they teach you, it's just a whole class dedicated to certain words in Revelation, just kidding, the eleventh, I'm making half of these up
[time=2083] as I go, the eleventh jasenith and the twelfth amethyst and the twelve gates, verse 21 and
[time=2091] the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each one of the gates was a single pearl, I don't want
[time=2100] to go too fast, I want you to, again I know it's hard sometimes to mentally keep up and the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each one of the gates was a single pearl and the rest
[time=2114] of the city, in case we missed it the first time, was pure gold like transparent glass,
[time=2122] it's an amazing, amazing picture that gets painted, the city's exact dimensions are measured
[time=2133] by this angel for John and reported to be what would have been in that day, twelve thousand stadia, the equivalent of fifteen hundred miles or twenty two hundred kilometers in length,
[time=2145] width and height.
[time=2147] Now even though these proportions may have and some have said this for years, there are many who have studied that passage and concluded for you and I that all of that physicalness,
[time=2159] all of those dimensions, all of those measurements, they say that we should just take as being symbolic, there are those who say that, there are others and I think I would probably having
[time=2171] read and studied now myself, there are others who would say wait a minute, why would you say that, why couldn't those measurements that you've given us be absolutely literal
[time=2183] measurements of this literal place where these literal people in physical form will
[time=2190] exist forever. I think it's fascinating on the literal front that verse seventeen says
[time=2196] what it says, look at that and he measured its wall seventy two yards according to what,
[time=2204] human measurements, human measurements which are also angelic measurements, a city of this
[time=2214] size, okay here you go, you ready? A real city which I believe it is, the new Jerusalem
[time=2220] on the new earth as it comes down and takes its place, a city of this size in the middle
[time=2228] of the United States and I first hour, I never thought about this during the week and then right in the middle of first hour I said boy we should have a map and so boom, these are some unbelievable folks upstairs, they've got us a map, okay so there's your map of
[time=2243] the United States of America, okay here you go, a city of this size in the middle of the United States which stretch from Canada to Mexico and from the Appalachian mountains,
[time=2257] gosh is that Tennessee or is that New York? Somebody say it out loud, somebody say it both?
[time=2267] Oh it starts in Tennessee and goes to New York, okay great thanks, I knew I was close,
[time=2273] I need one of those laser pointer things right now, oh I got one, alright so cool so we got
[time=2280] Canada to the, we're so high tech, we got Canada down to Mexico and the Appalachians show
[time=2286] me again where the Appalachians are, okay cool, all the way to the coast of California,
[time=2293] how are we doing? That would be pretty much, that would be the physical scope of the New
[time=2304] Jerusalem, Appalachians to the California coast, Canada down to Mexico, the New Jerusalem
[time=2312] is all square footage anyone could ask for, even more astounding, many of the folks that
[time=2318] I read noted even more astounding is its height, 1500 miles high. Somebody mentioned we don't
[time=2328] need to worry that heaven will be crowded, the ground level with these given dimensions
[time=2335] the ground level of the city will be nearly 2 million square miles, 2 million square miles,
[time=2345] this is 40 times bigger than England, 15,000 times bigger than London, it's 10 times as
[time=2351] big as France or Germany and far, far larger than India and remember that's just the ground
[time=2358] level, I love this, given the dimensions of a 1500 mile cube if the city consisted of
[time=2366] different levels and we don't know this but let's just say for sake of trying to gain
[time=2372] some physical parameters here, if it's a 1500 mile cube, if the city consisted of different
[time=2378] levels and if each story were a generous 12 feet high the city would have over 600,000
[time=2387] stories with a 2 million square mile base, 600,000 stories, anybody want to go run the
[time=2396] stairs? How about an elevator ride? Unbelievable. If they were on different levels, billions,
[time=2407] billions of people could occupy the New Jerusalem with many square miles per person. It's amazing,
[time=2415] Randy Alcorn says the cube shape of the New Jerusalem reminds us of the cube shape of
[time=2421] the most holy place in the temple, if you go to 1 Kings chapter 6 you might want to write that down. If you go to 1 Kings chapter 6 and you study the dimensions that God gave for the temple, you see a cubed shape most holy of holies place in the temple. Alcorn
[time=2439] says the three dimensions perhaps are suggestive of the three persons of the Trinity and their
[time=2445] home in this glorious city, God in all forms will live in the city and it is His presence
[time=2453] that will be its greatest feature. I believe it's literal. I understand that if there
[time=2461] are some who think we should just see it as symbolic and just kind of walk away from Revelation 21, 15 and 16 and just say well it's just going to be really big, you know,
[time=2473] but don't take, you know, I find the fact that God went to such great lengths to communicate the specifics of it. I think to be a clear indication that He wants you and I, well we're
[time=2485] not going to understand everything. I think He wants you to understand now today at least as much as we can what physically it's going to entail, what physically it is going to look
[time=2497] like in essence. And I think those dimensions there in Revelation 21 give you some help.
[time=2502] Now watch this, Revelation in verse, in chapter 21 and then on in other places it talks about
[time=2510] city gates and we saw it already and I want you to jot this down, the significance of the city's gates. Let me take you back to Revelation 21 12. Will you turn there? Revelation
[time=2522] 21 12. I think there's great significance and many of the authors and commentators that
[time=2528] I've read on this for this study seem to agree, significance to this idea and notion of the
[time=2535] city having these gates, these amazing, marvelous, huge gates. It had a great high wall, verse
[time=2543] 12. This new Jerusalem had had a great and high wall with 12 gates and at the gates 12
[time=2551] angels and names were written on them which are the names of the 12 tribes of the sons
[time=2558] of Israel. There were verse 13, there were three gates on the east and three gates on
[time=2566] the north and three gates on the south and three gates on the west. Three gates on every
[time=2572] wall and the wall of the city had 12 foundation stones. We'll just stop, we'll stop there.
[time=2579] Some things to just consider. I want you to note this in your mind or even just write it down as you think about the significance of the city, the new Jerusalem having gates and what that can tell us today. Number one, I just wrote this, gates always, gates have from the very beginning the first gate that ever got made, the first gate that ever got put in a castle, first gate that ever got put on a homestead. I mean, gates have always been by and large a symbol of protection. Gates were established from the very beginning
[time=2609] of time as something that could be used to keep people in, to keep people out. It has
[time=2615] always been symbolically a picture and in the scriptures the gate has always been a
[time=2621] symbolic picture of God and the safety and the protection that he has provided from the
[time=2627] enemy, from attack, from destruction. Now, you're saying, but is there going to be any attack in heaven? No, there will be no destruction, there will be no enemy, there will be no danger
[time=2638] in heaven. But that doesn't mean, I don't think, that means for a moment, that the presence of the gates can't be for you and I, those who will be there, a forever indicator and
[time=2652] a forever reminder of the great protection that God gave and provided you and me with.
[time=2660] Symbolically, I think there's something there to the gate and its symbolism of protection and safety. Secondly, write this down, gates in Revelation, go to Revelation 21, 25. Revelation
[time=2678] 21, 25 says, "In the daytime, for there will be no night." You do know that, right? Kids,
[time=2687] kids, you know, there will be no bedtime. You understand that? There will be no night.
[time=2694] It will just go on and on and on. I don't know, somebody asked me about naps. I don't
[time=2700] know. Does anybody in the room enjoy a nap? Let me see if you have, I think they're going to be there personally. Let's just say they're going to be there. I don't think it means it has to be night though. I mean, we all know, you can take a great nap in the middle of the what? The day, all right. Verse 25, "In the daytime, for there will be no night
[time=2718] there. Its gates will never be closed." The gates will never be closed. The gates of the
[time=2729] New Jerusalem, the gates, this heaven on earth, are always open, indicating that people are
[time=2736] always what? People are always welcome. I love this. I think this is very significant.
[time=2742] There will be constant access to the throne. It is the throne of God that will exist in
[time=2748] the New Jerusalem. People will come to a door. People will come to worship. There will be great spiritual activity and everybody has access and there will never be a time when
[time=2761] that access will be denied. Everybody always welcomed constant access to the throne. You
[time=2767] know what else I see in the open gates? The gates that are never closed. The gates that are always open. One more thing I see there is that in heaven, there will be the absence
[time=2780] of elitism. It will always be equal access to everybody. No special past needed, right?
[time=2792] No special password. I love that picture. This last week, a very good friend did just
[time=2800] a very kind and gracious thing for me and a couple of others. It was really cool. We
[time=2808] got to go to a baseball game this last week when the San Francisco Giants were over in Cincinnati.
[time=2815] We went to a Reds game. I've been to a lot of sporting events and I've had a lot of fun at a lot of sporting events. I've been in a lot of places to see ball clubs play. There have been a few times in my years where I've actually in those settings had like decent
[time=2831] seats. This friend did an amazingly gracious and generous thing. We got to go to this game
[time=2838] and we got to sit right behind home plate. My ticket said row one seat A. How am I doing?
[time=2848] I was through the roof. I was so excited. It was really cool. It was very nice. I was
[time=2854] closer to the catcher than the pitcher was. Everybody who came on the on deck circle,
[time=2861] I mean, I just talked to him, you know, like I could just talk to you right now. It was just so cool. But here's the thing. And I was grateful for that and I'm okay with that.
[time=2871] But it reminded me as I'm experiencing that, how at times there really is in our world
[time=2877] today, you know, there is this sense wherever you go of the haves and the what? And the
[time=2884] have nuts. I'll tell you what, I've been to a lot of games and sat in a lot of bad seats.
[time=2889] And whenever I give my ticket to the guy, when I had a bad ticket, I'll tell you what, that guy looks at me, punches and says, have a nice time. Would you like some binoculars?
[time=2898] You know, I'll tell you what, when I gave them, when we gave them these tickets, it's just amazing how when you give them these tickets, they look at it and go, oh. And it's like immediately, look at you like, I wonder who you are. And I wonder how you got this ticket. I wonder how much money you make. I wonder what you do for a living. I mean, all that's running through their minds. You could just see it. And then you, then the here was the thing that got me was we walked, you kind of go down through this corridor and there's this nice restaurant and you can eat and then you go out to the seats, you kind of come up through a tunnel underneath and you come out to these seats into the ballpark and I walked right down to these seats. I was having such a great time and I got to my seat and we're all standing there and I turn around and it's like the whole place is looking at you going, how did you get those seats? I wonder who you are. I wonder
[time=2950] how much money you make. I wanted to just yell. I don't make anything. It was a gift.
[time=2955] I promise. But it's a great picture of what heaven won't be like. There will be no elitism.
[time=2965] There will be no separation. I wrote this down for you. Everyone will have access. Everyone
[time=2971] will have access to God, the greatest seat in the house. Everyone will have access to
[time=2978] God in the New Jerusalem because of Christ's blood. His death is the admission ticket to
[time=2985] every part, every place, nook and cranny of the New Jerusalem. People won't have to prove
[time=2991] their worth or buy their way through the gates. All people will have access to the city's parks,
[time=2998] museums, restaurants, libraries, concerts, sporting events, anything and everything the
[time=3005] great city has to offer. As I was reading that quote for the first time, I thought, wait
[time=3013] a minute, parks, museums, restaurants, libraries, concerts, sporting events. See to some of
[time=3023] us because of the view of heaven that we grew up with, that almost sounds sacrilegious because
[time=3031] dog on it. We're going to have harps and robes and sit on clouds. You're telling me I get
[time=3037] to play golf? I mean, you're telling me we're going to go to concerts and parks and eat
[time=3043] in restaurants and maybe on a new earth, a redeemed, perfect place where we would get
[time=3054] to experience all that God has created. Yeah, I love this. I love how the quote ends. Nobody,
[time=3063] nobody will have to peek over the fence or look longingly through the window into the
[time=3070] New Jerusalem. Amen? I think it's worth noting again, and I'll let you go. I want to note
[time=3079] this one more time. I mentioned it briefly. Gates have always been, when you have a gate
[time=3085] in front of your house, what do you do? You go in through it and you go what? You go out
[time=3091] through it. Gates have always been used, my friends. It just makes sense for entering
[time=3097] and exiting. And the New Testament, in the New Jerusalem, there will be three gates on
[time=3104] every wall, each of them, 1,500 miles wide made of pearl. Where will we all be going?
[time=3117] And where will we all be coming from? I don't know, but my point is I just think it's worth
[time=3123] reiterating. I believe the Scriptures teach and it even speaks to a coming and going.
[time=3131] I think some people almost apologetically have asked me over the weeks, gosh, we're all good with the whole New Jerusalem thing. And we know there's dimensions and the streets of gold and the tree of life and the river, we're good with all that. But I think sometimes they wonder, is that really, are we just going to be there? And I think the answer is no.
[time=3153] I think you and I are going to be coming and going. I think we're going to be traveling.
[time=3158] I think it will be a place that we come to. I think it'll be a place that we leave and we come back to. And I don't know all that we're going to be doing, but I love how this
[time=3169] is said, let me just read this to you. Alcorn says people have told me they can't get excited
[time=3176] about the New Jerusalem because they don't like cities, but this city will be different.
[time=3180] It will have all the advantages we associate with earthly cities, but none of the disadvantages.
[time=3186] The city will be filled with natural wonders, magnificent architecture, thriving culture,
[time=3192] but it will have no crime, no pollution, no sirens, no traffic fatalities, no garbage or homelessness. It will truly be heaven on earth. If you think you hate cities, you'll quickly change your mind when you see this one. Imagine moving through the city to enjoy the arts, music and sports without pickpockets, pawn shops, drugs or prostitution. Imagine
[time=3213] sitting down to eat and raising glasses to toast the king, who will be glorified in every pleasure we enjoy. The artist's fingerprints will be seen everywhere in the great city.
[time=3226] Every feature of the New Jerusalem speaks to his attributes. The priceless stones speak
[time=3233] of his beauty and grandeur. The open gates speak of his accessibility at all times. All
[time=3239] who wish to come to him at his throne may do so at any time. We can learn Alcorn says we can learn a lot about people by walking through their homes. The whole universe, the
[time=3250] whole universe, the entirety of the new earth will be God's home. And the New Jerusalem
[time=3256] will be his living room. God will delight to share with us the glories of his capital
[time=3263] city and ours. Now let me say this to you before we go. We're going to come back in the days
[time=3271] to come. We're going to look at what God's Word has to say about this river that runs
[time=3277] from the throne of God right through and down the main street of the New Jerusalem,
[time=3283] the river of life. We're going to talk about the tree of life. We'll talk a little bit more about the New Jerusalem. We're going to spend a couple of weeks talking about the reality of heaven and how heaven's reality should impact the way you and I live and face today. We're
[time=3297] going to answer some questions that have been coming in about heaven. We'll probably take a Sunday to do that. But I want to tell you this. This is how this thing's going to end.
[time=3304] And I don't mind saying this to you now. I think it's good that you and I would understand this. There is a question that we've got to ask in a study like this about a place like
[time=3317] this and the question is this. Who gets in? Who gets to experience all of this? And while
[time=3327] there is so much about heaven that is confusing and while there is so much about it that I
[time=3333] think God purposefully has left mysterious, my friends, be reminded there isn't any mystery.
[time=3341] There is no confusion in God's word as it relates to that question. Who gets in? Who
[time=3350] will get to experience all of this and more that we've been discussing? You need to know
[time=3357] the answer to that. You who know him need to be reminded of the answer to that. You who
[time=3365] are searching, those of you here in this room and those of you watching who still haven't come to that point where you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him, you need to know
[time=3376] the answer to that question because he wants nothing more than to share all of this with
[time=3383] you. But there is a choice. There is a decision that you and I must make. And it is the most
[time=3391] important one you'll ever make. And we'll talk about that. And we'll teach you about that at length. Father God thank you for the morning and we thank you God for the privilege
[time=3405] of getting just a glimpse into this physical and spiritual reality that will be ours forever
[time=3415] with you if we know you, if we are yours. And oh Father God I pray that while many in the
[time=3422] room may be encouraged as their understanding grows I pray God that you would take this
[time=3428] study. God I pray that you would take us. I pray that we could be priests as we've talked about in the past. God people who are yours who want to represent you and what is true
[time=3439] about you and God we know that heaven is true. We know its reality will come. And oh God
[time=3446] if we could just be in your time and place used by you to pass along these truths to
[time=3454] others. Oh God this will be worth it. This study would be worth it. Thank you for these people. Thank you for this family that you've given us. Oh God I pray that we would live
[time=3465] in light of heaven. I pray as Corbin encouraged us this morning that we would be worshipers
[time=3471] of you and not stuff. Oh God fill us up. Give us strength and courage as we leave for it's
[time=3477] in your son's name that we pray. And everybody agreed and said amen.
