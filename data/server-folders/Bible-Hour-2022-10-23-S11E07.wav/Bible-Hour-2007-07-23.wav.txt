[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all news, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=63] Tell us the officer shouted as he brought the whip down again across the pastor's back.
[time=70] We must know who else is working with you.
[time=74] Day after day, the Chinese Communist tortured Reverend Feng Chang, but no matter what they
[time=80] did to him, he steadfastly refused to give him the names of his fellow Christians.
[time=87] One day, Chang was brought before the examining officer.
[time=91] In a corner of the room, he saw a heap of rags and heard a rattling chain.
[time=97] As the image became clearer, he realized it was his mother.
[time=105] He could see that she too had passed through heavy suffering.
[time=110] The Communist spoke to Chang, "I have heard that you Christians have ten commandments
[time=116] supposedly given to you by God, that you strive to obey.
[time=122] I would be interested in knowing them.
[time=124] Would you be so kind as to recite the ten commandments?" Chang was in a terrible state of heart.
[time=132] He began the list of commandments.
[time=134] When he arrived at honor your father and mother, he was interrupted.
[time=140] The Communist told him, "Chang, I wish to give you the opportunity to honor your mother.
[time=146] Here she is, suffering in chains.
[time=151] Tell us what you know about your brethren in faith, and I promise that tonight you and your mother will be free.
[time=159] You will be able to give her care and honor."
[time=165] Let us see now whether you really believe in God and wish to fulfill his commandments.
[time=173] It wasn't easy to make a decision.
[time=175] Chang turned to his mother, "Mother, what shall I do?"
[time=181] His mother answered, "I have taught you from childhood to love Christ and His holy church.
[time=190] Don't mind my suffering.
[time=193] Seek to remain faithful to the Savior.
[time=196] If you betray, you are no more my son." This is the last time Feng Che saw his mother.
[time=214] We have your nephew, the handwritten note said, "If you surrender to us, we will return the
[time=220] boy to his parents." Brother PT stared at the message.
[time=226] It was from the leaders of the New People's Army, the military arm of the Communist Party in the Philippines.
[time=233] People in many parts of the Philippines have been threatened and persecuted for years by this group.
[time=239] Brother MT is an evangelist.
[time=241] He travels regularly into the mountains to preach to the terrorist groups.
[time=246] Peter, his eight-year-old nephew, frequently went with Brother PT, MT, on these trips.
[time=256] He was a special help to him in the children's meetings in the mountain villages.
[time=261] As a result of Brother MT's ministry, some of the NPA officers had given their lives
[time=269] to Jesus Christ and left the organization.
[time=273] MT had counted the cost and was prepared to give his life for the gospel.
[time=279] But he wasn't prepared for this.
[time=284] He knew that there was no hope that his surrender would spare the life of his nephew.
[time=290] He knew that they would both be killed.
[time=294] Still he hesitated.
[time=297] The boy's parents insisted that MT ignore this order and continue his evangelical outreach.
[time=305] As a result, the parents gave their son for the gospel.
[time=310] Peter was killed on Good Friday, April 17, 1992.
[time=317] He was tortured for three hours.
[time=321] His hands were tied with wire, and the terrorists struck him on the legs and the head with an
[time=328] axe.
[time=330] Finally, he was beheaded.
[time=334] The abductors have warned the boy's parents and MT that if they do not stop their ministry, they will return and torture them.
[time=342] Brother MT is continuing his work in the mountains among the terrorist groups.
[time=358] On a Wednesday morning, just over three months ago, 46-year-old German Christian and father
[time=365] of three, Tillman Gask, prepared to go to his office, kissing his wife goodbye, and taking
[time=372] a moment to hug his son, and give him the priceless memory, "Goodbye, son.
[time=380] I love you." Tillman rented an office space from a publishing company, which was also the location of the
[time=389] Malatia Evangelic Church.
[time=393] In another area of town, 35-year-old pastor, Nikati Iten, father of two, said goodbye to
[time=400] his wife, leaving for the office as well.
[time=403] They had a morning Bible study and a prayer meeting that some other believers in town would be attending.
[time=409] Yegur Yucksaf also made his way to the Bible study.
[time=414] None of these men knew that what awaited them at the Bible study was the ultimate testing and application of their faith.
[time=424] On Resurrection Sunday, Pastor Nikati and his men had arranged an invitation only evangelistic
[time=431] service in the conference room of a hotel in the city.
[time=435] In attendance that day were five young men known to the believers as seekers.
[time=442] No one could imagine their real motive for attending.
[time=446] The morning of the Bible study, the five young men, as well as five others, got guns, bread
[time=453] knives, ropes, and towels ready for their final act of service to Allah.
[time=460] They arrived in time for the Bible study around 10 o'clock.
[time=466] After they arrived, and apparently the Bible study began, reportedly after Nikati read a
[time=472] chapter from the Bible, they began their assault.
[time=476] The boys tied Ughur, Nikati, and Tillman's hands and feet to chairs.
[time=481] As they videotaped their work on their cell phones, they brutally tortured the brothers
[time=487] for almost three hours.
[time=490] Another believer, Gokhan and his wife arrived at the office around 1230, and could not get
[time=497] into the office.
[time=499] He called the cell phones of his brothers, and finally Ughur answered the phone.
[time=504] We are not in the office.
[time=506] Go to the hotel meeting.
[time=508] We are there.
[time=510] We will be there.
[time=512] He said cryptically.
[time=514] As Ughur spoke, Gokhan heard in the background weeping and a strange snarling sound.
[time=520] Gokhan summoned the police.
[time=522] The officer pounded on the door.
[time=524] "Police!
[time=525] Open up!" At that point, they heard another snarl and a gurgling moan.
[time=532] The police understood that sound as human suffering.
[time=536] He prepared his clip in his gun and tried over and over again to burst through the door.
[time=543] One of the frightened assailants unlocked the door for the policeman, who entered to find a grisly crime scene.
[time=551] Tillman and Nikati had been slaughtered.
[time=553] Ughur's throat was likewise slit, and he was barely alive.
[time=558] Later, he died.
[time=562] Someday the video of their deaths may reveal more to us about the strength that Christ gave them to endure their last cross, and about the peace of the Spirit of God that had endowed
[time=572] them with enough power to suffer for their beloved Savior.
[time=578] We know he did not leave their side.
[time=582] We know their minds were full of scripture, strengthening them to endure.
[time=587] We know that they encouraged each other to stand strong, and they knew that they would
[time=594] soon be with Christ.
[time=612] He was dressed away, this world accused him of lies.
[time=625] Full of power and grace with an angel's face, he claimed Christ as Lord, and was sentenced
[time=639] to die, and as eternity stood, the stones throw away.
[time=649] Stephen's eyes met Jesus, and he began to pray, "I will stand for you because you died
[time=664] for me, I'll be down my life for the world to see that your power is real, that your
[time=679] love is true, you die for me, Jesus you die for me, I'll stand for you."
[time=689] "I'll stand for you, Christ was looking down, Stephen Payne, a precious price.
[time=715] He gave everything, every hope and dream, for the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice,
[time=730] and as the heavens opened, one met a boy in today, Christ rose from his feet and walked
[time=745] away, I will stand for you because you died for me, I'll be the heaven for the world to
[time=763] see that your power is real, that my love is true, you die for me, Stephen, you die for
[time=774] me, Stephen, you die for me, I'll stand for you, I'll be down my life for the world to
[time=804] see that your power is real, that my love is true, I'll stand for you, I'll stand for
[time=827] you, I'll stand for you, I'll stand for you, I'll stand for you, I'll stand for you,
[time=919] stand for you, I'll stand for you, I'll stand for you.
[time=948] Are you willing to stand with great strength and faith and hold tightly and firmly to that
[time=954] which is true and right and good, I hope you are and I hope this morning I hope the opportunity
[time=960] to pray for those who are truly and really in need, I hope it encourages your heart,
[time=966] I hope it brings you to a place of recognition that yes there are those who face that kind
[time=972] of reality and yes you and I need that same courage and that same strength.
[time=976] Hey this morning we're going to jump back in, it's been kind of a sober, very serious
[time=984] morning and I would just say to you here at the outset of our ongoing discussion on heaven
[time=992] that it won't get a whole lot lighter this morning because while we come to I think what
[time=999] is listed there in your bulletin as part two as it relates to questions about heaven really this morning we find ourselves kind of focusing our thoughts and our attention
[time=1010] on a question and it is a question that has been coming up again and again the emails
[time=1016] again have been coming, the letters have been written, the hallway conversations continue
[time=1022] to be had and a question that seemingly week after week after week continues to get asked
[time=1030] as we talk about and study God's word as it relates to heaven is what about hell, what
[time=1038] about hell, you can just turn that off Dean it's okay, thank you very much.
[time=1045] People I think as they give thought to the future and many of you in the room as we've
[time=1053] given time and study and attention to what God has prepared for those that know him, I think anytime you begin to think about that you begin to think about the other side the flip side if you will of the coin and spiritually whenever we're talking about heaven the flip side of that coin many of you know is a very real place called hell and so people are asking
[time=1075] today they're asking us to speak to this issue while in a series on heaven they're wondering about the reality of hell let me get you thinking about it if I can along these lines I want
[time=1090] you to think of a time in your life where you got a second chance go ahead think think about a time in your life maybe it was when you were a kid maybe it was you know when you were in school maybe it's you know as a young adult I mean think of a time where you really really got a second chance think about a big a big do over in your life where
[time=1111] where something had transpired a certain choice had been made you or I we find ourselves in this circumstance and just think of a time when you got to for whatever reason kind of step back and try again maybe it was at school with a test maybe it's been on the
[time=1129] side of the road with a policeman raise your hand if you've received a warning instead of a ticket I mean our life really when you think about it's filled with second chances
[time=1139] it may have been in a marriage it may have been in some situation with a coworker I mean
[time=1147] there's all kinds of situations where you and I get the opportunity to kind of have another crack at it I'm thinking about last Sunday watching the golf on TV at the British
[time=1158] Open there's a guy today named Podrick Harrington who's carrying around the cleric jug winner of the British Open he got a if you watched it if you know the story at all he got a second chance I'm thinking about even in the scriptures you just start thinking through the characters
[time=1174] that you and I find in the Bible think about some folks who had a second opportunity to make right when what they had done had led them to wrong I think about Samson I think about David I think about Peter people who had second chances I think about my own son
[time=1192] Jake seven years old and you know how it is with little guys they go through different phases you know with him like with many of yours I'm sure when they were younger one week they love basketball and one week they love football and one week they're into science stuff and one week they want to play baseball and we're just going through all that lately in our backyard the big thing has been and it's been very very cool I had a great time doing it his older brother has helped out his mom's gotten involved he has a glove he's got a baseball we got a bat and he wants somebody to hit him pop flies and so out to the backyard
[time=1228] we'll go and we'll hit we'll hit fly ball after fly ball after fly ball and he's just getting the hang of this and so as we're moving down this path and hitting fly balls he doesn't
[time=1239] catch a single one they fly over his head they fly under his head they go to the right they
[time=1245] go to the left but God bless him he's got his glove on and he's out there just running as fast as he can and he's not deterred then he's not really that discouraged and they're
[time=1255] just dropping all around him you know one day last week probably forty five minutes to an hour I mean my arms were sore the next day from hitting fly balls to this little guy they didn't catch a one but I'll tell you what you know as the as the ten minutes
[time=1270] turned into twenty is the twenty turned into thirty and as he could sense you know that maybe I was getting a little tired you know he began to say it again and again and again daddy daddy daddy give me one more try daddy daddy daddy give me one more okay this is
[time=1288] it boom hit the ball drops it oh daddy please give me one more one more try you and I have
[time=1297] been given a lot of one more tries amen my friends there will come a day however when
[time=1308] there are no more chances spiritually literally there will come a day when the doovers will
[time=1319] cease and people will give an answer and I read recently in an article published just
[time=1331] a short time ago I read one of the most powerful statements I think I've read in a long long
[time=1338] time just captured here at the beginning of this article and I want to just read this to you this morning and it says simply this says the very moment you slip behind the
[time=1351] parted curtain of death and again we're all on the same page right we all understand that
[time=1360] that moment will come right right the very moment you slip behind that parted curtain
[time=1371] of death you will either be enjoying a personal welcome from Christ or catching your first
[time=1379] glimpse of doom as you have never known it before either way your future will be irrevocably
[time=1389] fixed and eternally unchangeable it's a powerful powerful statement the very moment you slip
[time=1403] behind the parted curtain of death you will either be enjoying a personal welcome from Christ or catching your first glimpse of gloom as you have never known it before either way
[time=1415] your future will be at that moment irrevocably fixed and eternally unchangeable the article
[time=1426] goes on to quote the great author C.S. Lewis who said every human being is in the process
[time=1433] of becoming a noble being noble beyond imagination or else alas a vile being beyond redemption
[time=1444] Lewis exhorts us to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which if you saw it now you would be strongly tempted to worship
[time=1456] or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet if at all only in a nightmare
[time=1464] there are no ordinary people Lewis says it is immortals whom we joke with work with
[time=1471] Mary snub and exploit immortal horrors or everlasting splinters end quote this article
[time=1480] goes on to say those who find themselves in heaven will be surrounded with friends who may have known on earth friendships once rudely interrupted by death will continue where they left off every description of heaven they have ever heard will pale in the light of its reality
[time=1498] all of this with him in his glory forever others others indeed many others will be shrouded
[time=1510] in darkness a region of deprivation and unending regret there with their memories and feelings
[time=1519] fully intact images of their life on earth will return to haunt them they will think back
[time=1525] to their friends family and relatives they will brood over opportunities they've squandered
[time=1531] and intuitively know that their future is both hopeless and unending for them death will
[time=1539] be far worse than they imagined and so while relatives and friends plan your funeral deciding
[time=1549] on a casket a burial plot and who the pallbearers shall be you will be more alive than you have
[time=1556] ever been let me read that to you again while relatives and friends plan your funeral you
[time=1565] will be more alive than you have ever been you will either see god on his throne surrounded
[time=1573] by angels and redeemed humanity or you will feel an indescribable weight of guilt and
[time=1580] abandonment there is no destination midway between these two extremes just gladness or
[time=1588] gloom nor will it be possible and this is something this is this is a great biblical truth that
[time=1598] every one of us must keep in mind nor will it be possible to transfer from one region
[time=1604] to another no matter how endless the ages no matter how heartfelt the cries no matter
[time=1610] how intense the suffering your travel plans are limited to your present abode those who
[time=1617] find themselves in the lower gloomy regions shall never enter the gates that lead to endless light
[time=1624] and ecstasy they will discover that the beautiful words spoken in their eulogy bear no resemblance
[time=1631] to the reality that now confronts them if only their friends could see them now if only their
[time=1641] friends could see them now of the many trends my friends that i've observed in over 20 years
[time=1650] of ministry there is one that has always concerned me one that admittedly has always confused me
[time=1656] and the trend i'm referring to is the trend that many today in the church have adopted
[time=1662] that encourages people to keep hell out of the spiritual discussion to trim that encourages
[time=1671] people to keep hell out of the heavenly or salvation discussion and what they'll tell you basically
[time=1678] in so many words is this they'll say you don't want people choosing heaven just because they don't want to experience hell they'll tell you they've told me kelly don't talk about hell
[time=1691] they'll say you don't want people making a profession for christ out of fear and they'll say besides
[time=1697] hell's too negative hell's too discouraging hell's too depressing people want to come to church
[time=1705] and feel what good so don't talk about hell don't talk about flames and punishment and
[time=1713] destruction and damnation leave it out stick with what's positive
[time=1719] and while i understand that there are other essential components in the salvation or
[time=1726] heavenly discussion surely my friends surely the reality of heaven and the reality of hell
[time=1734] should be considered i'll tell you this as amazing and as glorious and as unspeakably
[time=1744] beautiful and painless and joy-giving as heaven will be hell will be that dark and that agonizing
[time=1752] and that hopeless and once you're there it's not like playing catch in the backyard
[time=1759] you don't get one more try turn with me if you would to Matthew 25
[time=1767] Matthew chapter 25 this morning we'll look at verses 41 to 46 and we'll allow that passage to
[time=1777] just kind of springboard us if you will into some other passages my intent and my hope this morning
[time=1783] my friends is to in no way give you all of what the bible says about hell i couldn't do that in
[time=1789] one sunday probably couldn't do it in ten hell and references to this eternity separated from
[time=1797] god there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of references to hell this morning what i want
[time=1803] to do is just try and give you a glimpse if we can as to how the bible itself how god's word describes this reality want to just try my best to give you some things to look at to give you
[time=1815] some things to consider as to how it is that god through his word his word intended for you and i
[time=1821] to gain a better understanding of him a better understanding of his character a better understanding of his redemptive plan what does the scripture say how does it define and describe this place of
[time=1834] eternal separation from god in Matthew 25 verse 41 and then he will say to those would you stand
[time=1844] by the way just in honor of god's word can we do that just in honor of his word would you quietly stand let me read this to you then he will also say to those on his left to those on his right he has said come in to the place i have prepared in 41 he says to those on his left depart from me
[time=1861] accursed ones into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels
[time=1870] for i was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink i was a stranger and you did not invite me in naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me then they themselves also will answer lord when did we see you hungry
[time=1887] or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not take care of you in 45 he says
[time=1893] then he will answer them truly i say to you to the extent that you did not do it to one of the
[time=1899] least of these you did not do it to me and here in 46 he says these then will go away into eternal
[time=1908] punishment but the righteous into eternal life father god we stand in humility before you
[time=1920] and we would readily admit i would readily admit i think many in the room would readily admit
[time=1929] that there are things about you that we don't fully understand
[time=1936] god there are things about you and your redemptive plan god there are things about you and what you have prescribed that in our humanness they stretch us god they stretch us and as we
[time=1948] think about this morning as we look to the scriptures as it relates to the reality of this place that
[time=1956] that that you've created were those who have rejected you go to spend eternity apart from you
[time=1964] oh god i pray that our humanness and that culture's message would be kept at a distance and that
[time=1973] we could in these moments consider you and your character and your truth father god we want to honor you we want to understand better what it is you've prescribed
[time=1986] we want to trust you so god please as we give ourselves to this study this morning
[time=1993] would you work in our hearts in ways that would allow us to do that very thing in your son's name we pray amen you can be seated i want you to look with me back at the last verse there in that
[time=2005] Matthew 25 41 to 46 passage look at 46 there it says that these will go those on the left
[time=2013] who he has just said this to these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into
[time=2021] eternal life it's just important to note there that the same greek word is used for eternal
[time=2028] eternal punishment eternal life the same greek word for eternal is used to describe the amount of
[time=2035] time people will spend in either heaven or hell that's right now what does that mean what that means
[time=2041] is the punishment of the wicked is as never ending as the joy and bliss of the redeemed it's the same
[time=2049] thing eternal eternal punishment eternal life the punishment of the wicked is as never ending
[time=2058] as the joy and bliss of the redeemed those who reject god's gift of salvation are not are not
[time=2066] annihilated sometimes if you ask people what happens to folks when they die some will tell you
[time=2072] that's just it curtains lights out it's over you just live you die and you cease it's not what the
[time=2080] scriptures teach they're not annihilated they don't come back as cows some will tell you that
[time=2086] there is such a thing as reincarnation where dead people come back as cattle or cats or whatever
[time=2095] it's not what the scriptures teach that there's no holding tank some religions teach that that
[time=2102] there's this place you go when you're die that's kind of in between and they're in this in between
[time=2108] place your your forever kind of gets determined based upon things nowhere in the scriptures is that
[time=2114] taught those who reject god's gift of salvation they are physically and emotionally and literally
[time=2123] going to experience eternity in a place of separation from god throughout the scriptures hell is
[time=2134] described in a number of different ways and this is not an attempt on my part to scare you this is
[time=2143] not an attempt on our part to to be dramatic this is not an attempt on our part to paint some picture
[time=2151] that shakes you to the bone and has you crawling down the aisles begging for merton oh this is an attempt to try and clearly communicate with you just like we've been trying to clearly communicate
[time=2163] with you about heaven we're just trying here in a few minutes to clearly communicate with you
[time=2169] what god's word says about this place of eternal separation and the way it is defined
[time=2177] and the way it is described by god for you in his word throughout the scriptures hell is described in a number of different ways we see in the scriptures
[time=2189] that hell is a place of you can write this down hell is a place of eternal fire we saw that look
[time=2196] at Matthew 2541 you saw it there depart from me a cursed ones into the eternal fire hell is described
[time=2204] throughout scripture as an eternal ongoing never-ending fire in other places it's referred to as an
[time=2212] unquenchable fire hell is a place of unquenchable fire right down Matthew 312 not only is it eternal
[time=2220] not only is it ongoing it can't be put out it is unquenchable bring your hose bring your water
[time=2228] it doesn't matter because this fire god's word says is a fire that will burn and it will burn god's
[time=2234] word says forever it is eternal it is unquenchable the scriptures speak of hell is a place of disgrace
[time=2242] and everlasting contempt a place of disgrace an everlasting contempt
[time=2251] go back to daniel if you will go to daniel chapter 12 daniel chapter 12 we see prophecy
[time=2259] here in this case regarding the destruction of man in the ultimate place of judgment and
[time=2266] separation from god and daniel 12-1 now at that time michael the great prince who stands guard
[time=2272] over the sons of your people will arise and there will be a time of distress such as never occurred
[time=2278] since there was a nation until that time and at that time your people everyone who is found
[time=2284] written in the book will be rescued many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground those who
[time=2291] had died will awake these two everlasting life but the others to there it is to disgrace and
[time=2299] everlasting contempt hell is referred to talked about referenced in the scriptures hundreds
[time=2309] and hundreds of times throughout the scriptures hell is described as a place where the worm does
[time=2315] not die and the fire is not quenched you can write down mark 9 44 through 49 where the worm does not
[time=2326] die and the fire is not quenched interesting note there in mark 9 i think important for you to just
[time=2334] take note of and be aware of as the word there in the greek uh for hell uh was connected in that day
[time=2342] to the valley of henan if somebody in the first century context there anybody in that culture who
[time=2349] would be reading in mark 9 or other places about this place called hell that the word hell there
[time=2355] in the greek would be connected immediately to a place called the valley of henan very real place
[time=2362] in that culture and in that day and in the valley of henan that was the place where all the garbage
[time=2369] all the refuse it was the dump of that culture in that time and what they would do in that valley
[time=2376] of henan in that hellish place was they would burn the garbage there would be multiple fires burning
[time=2383] on and on and on trying to deal with all of the debris and all of the refuse and all that was
[time=2390] brought to that valley the always burning fires would have been to a first century reader a graphic
[time=2397] reminder of hell's constant state burning garbage the scriptures speak of hell is a place of torment
[time=2408] and flame luke 16 23 and 24 turn there would you go back to the gospels if you would Matthew
[time=2415] mark luke john go to luke go to luke 16 luke 16 23 just a graphic but powerful picture
[time=2425] here hell being described as a place of torment and flame luke 16 23
[time=2436] up in 20 it says in a poor man named Lazarus was laid there was a rich man in 19 and and there was a poor man Lazarus laid at his gate covered with sores and longing to be fed
[time=2449] with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man's table besides even the dogs were coming
[time=2455] and licking his sores now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom
[time=2461] and the rich man also died and was buried in Hades he lifted up his eyes being in torment
[time=2469] and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom and he cried out and said father Abraham
[time=2476] have mercy on me what was he saying there he was saying dad hit one more let me have one more try
[time=2485] have mercy on me and send and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool
[time=2492] off my tongue for I am in agony in this flame the descriptions simply continue second thessalonians one would you turn there there we see
[time=2507] in the scriptures hell described as a place of eternal destruction
[time=2514] go to second second thessalonians chapter one would you do that second thessalonians chapter one let's start in verse five it says in second thessalonians one five this is a plain indication of God's righteous judgment
[time=2530] so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God for which indeed you are suffering
[time=2536] for after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give
[time=2544] relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven
[time=2551] with his mighty angels in flaming fire dealing out verse eight dealing out retribution to those
[time=2558] who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus watch this verse nine
[time=2566] these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction stop right there we use that phrase you read that
[time=2574] phrase you see that phrase on that screen eternal destruction sometimes you would maybe read that
[time=2581] so quickly you might just miss the significance of that because you and I understand destruction
[time=2587] you and I understand what it looks like when we kick over the sand castle you and I know what it
[time=2593] means to see the building that's that's set up with dynamite explode and crumble you and I see
[time=2599] all the time pictures of things or individuals being destroyed but that's destroyed once
[time=2606] this is this is what kind of destruction this is eternally being destroyed
[time=2618] this is being destroyed and never being destroyed this is always being destroyed
[time=2624] eternal destruction and now what I want to read to you here my friends and I'll just say this to you personally this is
[time=2634] just from this is just from me to you what I want to show you now here in this passage
[time=2641] is for me personally probably the for me this brings to my heart and mind the greatest sense
[time=2654] of fear the greatest sense of being disturbed the greatest sense of loss to me while I agree
[time=2664] with all that's been said everything you've heard me say everything that we've read so far these physically descriptive and terrible realities as it relates to worms that don't die and fires
[time=2676] that can't be quenched and the torment and the pain I believe all of that to be true I can't think
[time=2682] personally of anything worse than what I'm about to read to you and it is a reality
[time=2689] of heaven because it says in verse nine these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction and here it is
[time=2697] away from the what say it out loud away from the presence of the Lord
[time=2706] away from the presence of the Lord and I'll just say this from me to you I can't think of anything in
[time=2721] my life with him that's more comforting and more encouraging and and as sweet as his presence
[time=2733] does anybody identify with that don't we know what it's like to be able to to come to him
[time=2744] don't you know what it's like to be able to in your time of need realize that he is your rock
[time=2752] and your refuge your strong tower your help in time of need your rest your hope your defender your
[time=2758] encouragement don't we love his presence isn't it just one of the greatest joys in your life and
[time=2768] mind to know that at any moment we can be on our face or on our back or in our car or in our room
[time=2776] or in our office and experience the joy of knowing that he is near some people ask what is it about
[time=2784] hell that is so tormenting and unrelenting well aside from the literal physical pain
[time=2790] and agony there is this issue I believe my friends of his presence somebody said it this way the
[time=2796] cognizant the cognizant permanent irreversible separation the realization the cognizant realization
[time=2807] of this permanent irreversible separation from God and everything good try to get your arms around
[time=2816] that try to get your arms around an eternity without any without any any love no kindness
[time=2825] generosity goodness affection beauty peace joy laughter nothing removed forever from the presence of God and what's it say and the glory of his power
[time=2845] hell is described and the bible is a place of fire and brimstone where the smoke of their torment goes up forever revelation 14 10 and 11
[time=2859] my friends the scriptures teach and you know us you know that that we're not going to stand here
[time=2870] and proclaim something to you that's not proclaimed here and the scriptures teach this and if you're
[time=2876] wondering over these weeks as we've talked about heaven if you're wondering in your mind well what about hell this is what the scriptures teach the scriptures teach that the wicked are forever
[time=2888] subjected to the fury and wrath of the god who sacrifice and love they rejected see and that's
[time=2896] just that's just so hard for so many of you in this room that's just so hard at times for the
[time=2904] guy standing behind this pulpit it's just hard i'll admit that at times it is difficult at times
[time=2911] because i want my god to be the great rescuer because i want my god to be the great lover i want
[time=2918] my god to continue to be this great god of mercy and grace see i you know how i'm wired i want
[time=2924] everybody happy i think down deep in my heart i want everybody saved i want god to just save
[time=2931] everybody i want them to come to the realization of their sinfulness i want them even having rejected
[time=2939] him to somehow in the end come to realize his goodness and his grace see there's so many of us who just because we might be bent toward that side of his perfect character we just want him to be the
[time=2950] one who saves the day well the fact of the matter is that in that perfect character there is also
[time=2957] this thing called the justice of god and i want you to be clear about this i want us
[time=2968] those in this room those watching on the broadcast i want us to be really really clear about this
[time=2976] while he is loving and while he is just please don't miss this there is one reason
[time=2982] how many there is one reason and only one reason there is only one scenario that lands someone in hell
[time=2996] there's only one way that somebody gets to this point having gone through the the curtain there
[time=3004] of death there is only one way that that person doesn't see Christ welcoming them but instead sees
[time=3011] gloom for the first time in a way they've never seen it and that is when that person rejects the
[time=3018] redeemer when that person rejects Christ when someone refuses to bow the knee of their heart and
[time=3029] humbly accept the gift of life and forgiveness and i know there are some who would stand here
[time=3037] and say this to you differently i'm saying it to you today this way i believe the scriptures teach
[time=3043] that no one was predisposed predetermined or made from the beginning for hell i don't believe that
[time=3052] i don't believe that god made some for hell i don't believe that that god before you ever took a breath
[time=3059] predetermined you to go to hell for the rest of your life i don't believe that and i don't believe this teaches that i believe what this teaches is that when people reject the gift of life made
[time=3072] possible through the sacrifice of christ when they reject god's offer they choose for themselves
[time=3080] and eternity apart from god so i bring you back to the initial question or one of the initial
[time=3088] questions should we include hell in a discussion about heaven should we include hell in the in the
[time=3097] spiritual discussion that you and i have the privilege of having every day of our lives should i
[time=3103] include hell in this discussion in this family on this broadcast well i'll tell you this i don't think i should try to scare you with it i don't think that we should
[time=3116] overdramatize it i probably don't need to scream yell and wave my arms and pound my bible you and
[time=3124] i both have visions of hell fire and brimstone preachers who kind of came at it that way we're
[time=3131] not going to come at it that way but i'll tell you what and i'm just being honest with you hell's
[time=3138] hell's biblical reality its torment and pain is as real as heaven's bliss so i really in the end don't have any problem trying our best to communicate to you what it says
[time=3152] what the scriptures teach i want to remind you of this i want everybody in the room to hear me say
[time=3159] this i want to remind us that it's what we deserve we live in such a a culture dominated by entitlement and what we deserve and and what we should get
[time=3171] and how inherently good we are understand the scriptures very clear that we are inherently evil that we are depraved as human beings and left just to ourselves that's all you would in the
[time=3182] nc is our evil and our depravity and our sinfulness and our brokenness it is what we deserve i believe
[time=3189] the scriptures teach that clearly i believe in the gospels i see jesus spending a great deal of time
[time=3196] trying to steer people away from it and toward him so i guess in the end i believe it belongs in
[time=3203] the discussion i guess in the end i believe we shouldn't shy away from lovingly and genuinely
[time=3211] trying to communicate its reality and i want to say this to you as well remember that statement
[time=3217] we started with a few minutes ago remember some will say you don't want people choosing heaven just because they don't want to experience hell remember this my friends just tuck this away you don't choose you don't choose heaven you don't choose hell you choose christ or you reject him
[time=3239] that's the choice you choose christ or you reject him and i guess it's just a great opportunity for
[time=3249] me today to ask you what you've done not with religion
[time=3255] not with denominations not with your father or your mother's faith
[time=3265] it's a great opportunity for me to just ask you what have you done how have you chosen
[time=3272] as it relates to him because that in the end is the difference
[time=3279] have you have you chosen to by god's grace and by god's mercy and by god's calling have you chosen
[time=3286] to bow the knee of your heart and accept the gift of life and forgiveness and commit to follow him
[time=3293] or have you still to date decided to follow you have you stood proudly instead of bowing
[time=3301] have you in essence rejected this gift and in doing that at least are we clear today that in doing that
[time=3310] this is the path that you're on and i want to say this if somebody if somebody says to me
[time=3322] or if or if somebody's thinking right now well then there you go again see you're scaring them i guess in the end i'd be scared
[time=3334] and if it's wrong with me to say that or feel that then talk to me about it later
[time=3342] i don't think it's the only thing that we need to talk about i don't want again i don't want to throw this around and and pound my fist on this and and trying and scare you here in this moment
[time=3352] i think in the heart of hearts and down deepen your soul the reality of life forever separated from him it's probably going to scare you if you ever stop and think about what that really looks like
[time=3363] again and again and again and again all through the Old Testament especially in the Psalms and
[time=3369] Proverbs we see the phrase fear the what fear who fear the lord fear what's true and right
[time=3376] be encouraged yes we see examples of that as well but i'll tell you what the reality of hell
[time=3382] and the reality of heaven it's a reality and my hope is that you would choose him
[time=3390] i hope primarily because you love him and you're so grateful for what he did in sacrificing and
[time=3397] offering his son but i'm okay if somewhere in there underneath that love for him and that
[time=3403] gratitude for what he's provided if there's a sense down deep inside that you don't want to spend eternity being destroyed you'd rather spend eternity in the presence of god i think that's all right i don't think we've done you a disservice
[time=3422] in painting that picture and helping you make that decision amen i want you to stand and let's
[time=3428] pray together this morning father god so much more we could look at and so many other things to consider probably even more questions that get posed and i want to just thank you for your word
[time=3439] and i want to thank you for the clarity that it brings and i want to thank you for the the opportunity that you give us to understand you better i want to thank you for the hope of eternal
[time=3450] life and i want to pray for those in this room or those watching oh god give him courage to choose
[time=3456] what is right god give him courage to humble themselves lead them into a discussion with a
[time=3463] trusted friend bring them down here to the front today afterwards and let us have the chance of talking through these life-changing eternity altering issues with them god give us the privilege
[time=3474] of coming alongside those that would want nothing more than to experience your presence forever
[time=3481] in your son's name we pray amen
[time=3504] so
[time=3534] (upbeat music)
