[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all news, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=74] We are free, we are free, we are free.
[time=91] Sing this bridge together, the Son has set me free.
[time=98] If the Son has set me free, then I am free, I'm free indeed, and nothing can take that
[time=107] from me when I am free, forever from condemnation.
[time=114] If the Son has set me free, then I am free, I'm free indeed, and nothing can take that
[time=140] from me when I am free, forever free, there is no no condemnation, there is no no separation
[time=154] My salvation says I'm free, forever free, the land is overcome, the land is overcome,
[time=167] the land is overcome, we are free.
[time=174] The land is overcome, the land is overcome, the land is overcome, we are free, forever
[time=191] free, the land is overcome, we are free.
[time=209] If you believe that is true, would you say amen?
[time=218] Be seated, thanks.
[time=224] Now when my time came and I placed my faith in Jesus, God instantly granted me a great
[time=230] salvation, He forgave me of all my sins, past, present, and future.
[time=236] He made me His child, adopting me into His family.
[time=241] He gave me the gift of the Holy Spirit, who gives me God's power, who pours out God's
[time=247] love within my heart, and tenderly communicates to my spirit that I am a child of God, in
[time=254] an air of eternal glory in heaven.
[time=259] In saving me, God also freed me from slavery to any and all sins.
[time=265] I no longer have to sin again, for sin's mastery over me has been broken.
[time=271] In saving me, God also justified me.
[time=275] In being justified through Christ, I have a peace with God that won't do her forever.
[time=281] In justifying me, God declared me innocent of my sins, and pronounced me righteous with
[time=287] the very righteousness of Jesus.
[time=291] God also allowed His future and present wrath against me to be completely propitiated by Jesus, who bore upon Himself while on the cross.
[time=301] Consequently, God now has only love, compassion, and deepest affection for me, and this love
[time=308] is without any admixture of wrath whatsoever.
[time=323] God always looks upon me and treats me with gracious favor, always working all things together for my ultimate and eternal good.
[time=332] God's grace abounds to me even through trials, because I am a justified one.
[time=339] He subjugates every trial and forces it to do good unto me.
[time=344] When I sin, God's grace abounds to me, all the more as He graciously maintains my justified
[time=351] status as described before.
[time=354] When I sin, God feels no wrath in His heart against me.
[time=358] His heart is filled with nothing but love for me, and He longs for me to repent and confess
[time=364] my sins to Him, so that He might show me the gracious and forgiving love that has been
[time=370] in His heart all along.
[time=373] God does not require my confession before He desires to forgive me.
[time=378] In His heart, He has already forgiven me, and when I come to Him to confess my sins to Him, He runs to me as I were, and is repeatedly embracing and kissing me even before I get
[time=389] the words of the confession out of my mouth.
[time=392] God does see my sin, and He is grieved by my sins.
[time=398] His grief comes partly from the fact that in my moments of sin, I am not receiving the fullness of His love for me.
[time=406] He even sends chastisement into my life, but He does so because it is for me, and He loves
[time=412] me, and He disciplines me for my ultimate good.
[time=417] I don't deserve any of this even on my best day, but this is my salvation, and here in
[time=424] my stand, thank you, Jesus.
[time=450] The uncreated one, Your beauty fills the skies, but the glory of Your majesty, your eyes,
[time=476] worthy, uncreated one, from heaven to earth, come down, you lay aside Your royalty to
[time=497] wear the sinners' crown, O great God, be glorified, our lives laid down Yours magnified, O great
[time=521] God, be lifted high, there is none like You.
[time=539] Jesus, save Your God's own son, risen reigning Lord, sustainer of the universe by the power
[time=560] of Your Word, O great God, be glorified, our lives laid down Yours magnified, O great
[time=581] God, be lifted high, there is none like You.
[time=603] There is none like You, there is none like You.
[time=619] And when we see Your matchless face, and speechless all will stand, and there will bow with
[time=637] the Holy Spirit, O great God, be glorified, our lives laid down Yours magnified, O great
[time=663] God, be lifted high, there is none like You, there is none like You.
[time=693] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour again, my name is Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of not only being here with you on the broadcast each and every week but the
[time=703] distinct privilege of serving as senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries with an amazing team of people and we thoroughly enjoy and are deeply thankful for what God allows us
[time=714] to be a part of each and every week.
[time=717] I wanted to just tell you a couple things about what you are going to see in today's speech, I think a powerful reminder of how it is that you and I really should interact
[time=728] with the great truths of Scripture.
[time=730] You know for weeks now we have been studying and discussing this great truth about heaven.
[time=737] We have been in about a nine week series about heaven and God's eternal plan for those that know Him and today's message gives you a chance to really in essence respond to that truth.
[time=749] You know whenever we as believers, whenever we come face to face with the truth of Scripture
[time=756] it usually calls for a response.
[time=758] When I read the Scriptures, when I hear a great message, when I read a book that is filled
[time=764] with truth about marriage for instance, I am to respond in the everyday of my life as
[time=771] it relates to my marriage.
[time=773] When we hear from God's word great truth about the way we are to conduct ourselves in the marketplace, we are to respond in the day to day of life in the marketplace.
[time=782] When we read the Scriptures and when we hear a great message that talks about the way in which we would conduct ourselves mentally and in our minds and with respect to purity
[time=793] then we need to respond to that in the day to day of our lives.
[time=797] Well there is nothing different going on here.
[time=800] In light of all we have seen about heaven, in light of all that God has revealed and over these last nine weeks in light of all that you've heard about this great and very true reality, we believe there should be a response in the everyday of your life.
[time=816] There are some things that should be different.
[time=821] There is a response I think that God's word calls forth from you and I in light of and in view of heaven's reality and today we are going to look at just a few of those responses that I think should be so very present in your life and mind in light of this great reality
[time=838] of our eternal destiny.
[time=840] Thank you so much for your letters and your emails about the series.
[time=844] Thank you for the joy, really the joy that we have in partnering in this journey with you.
[time=850] Thanks for being a part of the Blackhawk family.
[time=852] I hope you'll open your heart today.
[time=854] Be open to the encouragement and the opportunity to learn that God's word will bring to you
[time=860] today.
[time=862] We hope you'll come by sometime and see us.
[time=864] Have a great week and God bless you.
[time=865] Thanks so much for tuning in.
[time=890] [MUSIC - 157 seconds]
[time=1051] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=1165] - Amen, and what a city that will be.
[time=1171] We studied that just a few weeks ago.
[time=1173] And the fact of the matter is that those of you that know him, those of you that have fully surrendered your hearts and lives to him, the children of God, the family of God someday will visit him in that city.
[time=1186] That great city where the throne will reside, where the river of life will flow, where the tree of life will bear its fruit, where believers will forever be coming and going in their worship of the king and their life on this new earth, and I'm so grateful for that powerful reminder again this morning.
[time=1206] Hey, as we wind down our study here on the topic of heaven, I'm so looking forward to what you'll get next week as Mitchell Cruz comes.
[time=1215] Mitchell's one of our teaching pastors and he'll be concluding our series next week.
[time=1220] And I really hope you'll be here.
[time=1222] It's gonna be a powerful conclusion and a chance for you to, I think, just take the whole thing in.
[time=1228] And I'm thankful for Mitchell and his willingness to do that.
[time=1232] This week, I thought what I would do, it's just more of a personal, kind of a personal just sharing from me to you.
[time=1239] I've just, in recent days, looked back on these last nine weeks.
[time=1244] And as I've just thought about all that we've studied and all that we've considered as, I've thought about all that I've learned and all that I've taken in.
[time=1254] You're not the only ones.
[time=1255] You sit each week and I do my very best with his help to give to you, but understand all along.
[time=1261] I'm receiving from him as I'm reading, as I'm studying, as I'm considering these truths.
[time=1267] And as I come to the end of this study, I just felt in recent days that it was important for me to try my very best to do what I hope every one of you would do.
[time=1279] I hope it's what we would always do.
[time=1281] I know sometimes, maybe we'd come up a little shy on this, but we need to keep working at it.
[time=1287] And what I'm referring to is this personal application.
[time=1291] You know, it's one thing for you and I to take in truth.
[time=1295] It's one thing for you and I to be exposed to what God's word says on any given subject matter or topic.
[time=1302] It's another thing, as James says, you and I are not to just be hearers of the word, but what?
[time=1308] Doers of the word.
[time=1310] And so for me, it's just been a time of personal reflection.
[time=1314] And as I think about all that we've studied, if all of this is true, and I believe it is, if all that we've seen about heaven is true, then there are some things I believe that I should be giving myself to in the everyday of life.
[time=1332] And it's just the way it's the way it should always be, my friends, when God's word speaks to you, when someone brings a message to you, when you listen to someone communicate the scriptures about marriage, for instance, you and I need to take that marriage truth and apply it to the everyday of life.
[time=1349] When you and I hear someone bring a message about what Jesus said and what Jesus commanded in terms of how we should approach and deal with and respond to the poor and the thirsty and the hungry and those in need, you and I would need to respond to that truth and respond in applying that truth to the everyday of life.
[time=1369] When I read God's word as it relates to church leadership, for instance, when I hear a message that somebody speaks on what it means and looks like to be a pastor or an elder in the way of church is to function, we take that very seriously and try our best to apply that truth in the everyday of how we would function.
[time=1388] So now here we are with all this truth about heaven.
[time=1391] And I'm just telling you personally, and again, I say personally, I don't think my personally is a whole lot different than your personally.
[time=1404] These are just things, I just wrote a few things down this week that I believe in my own heart in life I need to respond to in light of what God's word has taught us and showed us about heaven.
[time=1417] If all that we've studied about heaven is true, then I showed and I just, I wrote three things down here for us this morning.
[time=1425] You may immediately connect with what I share with you here.
[time=1430] You may not so much, but this is just kinda from my heart to you and I hope as we work our way through this, this list of just personal application for me personally, I hope that you can be encouraged and I hope maybe together we can pursue some of these things.
[time=1446] Number one, you can write it down as I think about all that we've studied and all that we've looked at.
[time=1451] If all that we've seen about heaven is true, then I believe I should personally, I should hope more.
[time=1458] I should hope more.
[time=1461] What do I mean by that?
[time=1464] Well, my friends, the clear and powerful reality of heaven, I believe the biblical promise of an eternal home, a restored physical body, a redeemed community of God's people from all ages past and future, a perfectly renewed earth and the eternal joy of worshiping and being with God in intimate personal proximity should bring great peace and a deep sense of joy and hope to the every day, to the every day, to the every moment, to the every circumstance, to the every situation of your life and mine.
[time=1503] I believe I should hope more.
[time=1507] Hope, you could look up and find a thousand different definitions.
[time=1512] One that I just wrote down as a deep and real confidence, a deep and real confidence in the spiritual realm, in the eternal realm, my friends, a deep and very real confidence of a future fulfillment,
[time=1527] of a future joy and comfort, a deep and real confidence of a future fulfillment, a future joy and confidence.
[time=1537] It happened again this week.
[time=1540] It has happened a hundred times in our 15 years of parenting.
[time=1544] It will happen, I'm sure a hundred times more.
[time=1548] You've experienced it.
[time=1549] I'm sure many of you, grandmothers and grandfathers, moms and dads, big brothers, big sisters, how many times have you been in the house that happened just three days ago for me?
[time=1559] In the house, walking down the hall and you hear on the driveway, the tragic collision of bikes.
[time=1566] All of a sudden, you hear the crash and you hear what immediately comes after the crash.
[time=1573] You begin to hear the screaming and the wailing and the tears.
[time=1576] I've heard it so many times.
[time=1578] It's happened so often.
[time=1579] I can tell you from deep inside our home who it was, what they hit.
[time=1585] And I could tell you the other day it was Jake and he hit the garage door.
[time=1589] I knew it, I knew it 50 yards away 'cause he just hasn't quite figured out the whole break thing.
[time=1595] And he's a little bit of a risk taker like his dad and wow, boom, it hit.
[time=1601] And I knew exactly what it was and I just kind of casually but with some degree of urgency made my way out the front door, down our little front walkway.
[time=1610] There he is, just a tangled mangled mess on his bike, leg, under, head back, hands hitting the ground and just your heart goes out.
[time=1620] And hope, hope is that look on his face
[time=1626] when he sees me.
[time=1629] It's that look right when he first sees me.
[time=1634] It's that look where he moves from otter to spare and pain and frustration and hurt to the reality that I'm coming, I'm gonna pick him up.
[time=1649] I'm gonna hold his head next to mine.
[time=1652] I'm gonna whisper, hey buddy, in his ear.
[time=1656] I'm gonna pat him on the back.
[time=1657] I'm gonna give him a big kiss.
[time=1658] We're gonna walk into the back bathroom.
[time=1660] I'm gonna sit him down the toilet.
[time=1663] I'm gonna sit him down.
[time=1663] I'm gonna get out that we're gonna have a debate about the peroxide.
[time=1666] He's gonna lose.
[time=1670] The peroxide's gonna go on.
[time=1672] He's gonna cry some more, but then he's gonna be fascinated by the bubbles, you know?
[time=1676] He's gonna look at the bubbles and then he's gonna say, can I do it?
[time=1679] And I'm gonna give him the peroxide bottle and he'll spill half the bottle as he tries to pour the whole thing on the one little cut.
[time=1685] Wasn't a little cut.
[time=1686] In fact, I was reminded after first hour.
[time=1688] In this case, it was very bloody and he had, what made it so bad was, and you'll identify with this, he had done that three days before and it was an old wound with us.
[time=1699] You know what I mean?
[time=1700] Yeah, you're all feeling his pain, aren't you?
[time=1702] But that's hope.
[time=1704] It's gonna get better.
[time=1710] It's gonna be okay.
[time=1714] And that is the reality.
[time=1718] Circumstance by circumstance, situation by situation in this room, that is the reality that you and I can't live with.
[time=1728] But it is going to get better.
[time=1730] Paul was so aware of this.
[time=1736] The writer of Hebrews was so aware of this.
[time=1739] All throughout scripture, God attempts to remind you and I of this.
[time=1743] Like a Romans chapter eight.
[time=1746] You can turn there if you would.
[time=1747] Romans chapter eight versus 18 to 20.
[time=1750] And then I wanna show you the first line in verse 24.
[time=1753] Paul says, for consider that the sufferings of this present time, your sufferings, the things that you encounter, the difficulties that you might face.
[time=1764] He says, for consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to even be compared with the glory, that is, there's heaven, there's the future, with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
[time=1780] For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God and he goes on in verse 20 to say, for the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it and he did that in what?
[time=1796] Say it in hope.
[time=1798] And then look what it says in verse 24.
[time=1802] Everybody together, for in hope, we have been saved.
[time=1807] The very presence of salvation in your being is for hope.
[time=1816] A deep and inner confidence of a future fulfillment.
[time=1821] A future joy and confidence.
[time=1824] David knew it well, he said in Psalm 27, and I think many of you in the room this morning have said this, you have thought this, you have cried this out, you can identify with him as he writes, I would have despaired, hope less, right?
[time=1839] I would have despaired unless I had believed that I would see the goodness there's heaven, there's glory, the goodness of the Lord in the land of the what, the living.
[time=1853] Wait for the Lord, be strong and let your heart take courage, yes, wait for the Lord.
[time=1862] Wait for the Lord, you know what?
[time=1864] Jake had to wait about 10 seconds.
[time=1870] I understand you may have to wait about 10 years.
[time=1874] I have no idea how long he will call you to endure.
[time=1880] I have no idea in situation by situation.
[time=1883] We have no idea how long that trial will last.
[time=1887] We have no idea where it will lead for sure, but one thing we can be reminded of in the everyday of life, in the every circumstance of life, in the every situation, whether it be 10 seconds and there's dad to pick you up, or 20 years, and there's dad to pick you up.
[time=1905] You, as a believer, have hope.
[time=1910] And there is no cause for despair.
[time=1913] We may have to suck it up for today.
[time=1915] We may have to endure or persevere, but heaven's reality should cultivate in me a great hope.
[time=1923] Not a great worry.
[time=1930] Any warriors in the room?
[time=1931] Not a great depression.
[time=1936] Not great anger, not great obsession or frustration.
[time=1941] No, my friends, the reality of all that we've studied about heaven should bring to your soul at its deepest level, great what?
[time=1948] Hope and internal confidence.
[time=1953] That doesn't come from anything you muster up.
[time=1955] It is a gift, it comes from knowing him, a deep, real confidence of a future fulfillment, a future joy.
[time=1963] I'll never forget.
[time=1968] And I was reminded of it just a few days, a week ago, maybe a week and a half ago, I drove by Snyder High School and saw out on the high school football practice field what you see at a lot of high schools these days when you drive by on an August summer day.
[time=1981] It's known as two a days.
[time=1983] And oh, my goodness, my mind, just I played football in high school and my mind went immediately back to hot, searing hot summer days.
[time=1992] Practicing in the morning and practicing in the afternoon and how hard it was and how demanding it was, how excruciatingly painful it was to do the drills, to run the plays, to do the calisthenics, to run the sprints, to go through all the things that you went through, the pads clanking and all the armor just, it was like an oven and you're just dying and you think you're going to just lose your life.
[time=2019] And I'll never forget how most of those days would end.
[time=2021] Most of those days when I played would end with 1540s.
[time=2026] Everybody on the line would be the call.
[time=2030] And the way he would do it is for us, we would begin on the end zone line and run.
[time=2035] These were sprints and you would sprint to the 40, stop, turn around, come back in succession, come back to the goal line, 1540s.
[time=2044] Never forget how I are placed.
[time=2046] I don't know how it was at yours.
[time=2048] Our coach and the staff had rigged up a drinking fountain with the PCV piping and it ran all the way along the back of the end zone and they poked all the holes in it and it was just this fountain of water.
[time=2059] And I tell you what, about halfway through those 15, he'd motion to somebody, somebody would turn on a switch and that thing would start flowing.
[time=2066] And I'll never forget just being 16 years old, 17 years old thinking I was gonna die and all of a sudden seven, eight sprints in, there's the fountain of water just shooting up in the end zone.
[time=2075] And I want to just encourage you this morning
[time=2081] to keep running, to finish, the drink, the sweet, the fulfillment that will come satisfying in ways
[time=2092] you would have never imagined.
[time=2095] And the sprint may be hard, but remember there is hope and I want to remind you of this.
[time=2101] There's not only eternal hope, my friends, but lamentations three says that his mercies are new every what, every single day.
[time=2110] He brings new hope and new promise and new strength and new courage.
[time=2116] [AMEN] I have felt in my own heart in recent days, I should hope more in light of all we've seen.
[time=2127] Secondly, I wrote this down in my own life as I've thought about all that we've studied and all that we've seen about heaven, I wrote down I should pray more, I should pray more.
[time=2137] What do I mean by that?
[time=2139] Well, if heaven is a reality and if hell is as well, my friends if heaven and hell are really truly
[time=2152] eternal realities, then all that we've studied and talked about these last two months, I think should lead me to two things.
[time=2160] One, I think I should be on my knees more often
[time=2166] begging God to bring people to faith.
[time=2169] Look with me if you would at first Timothy chapter two,
[time=2175] what a powerful reminder we see here in Paul's letter to Timothy.
[time=2179] Remember the context here, you have Timothy, who's a pastor, a struggling young guy, trying his best to stay at it and he's there in Ephesus and Paul's trying to write for him in ways whereby he can be reminded of what it should be about and what they should be giving themselves to there in the church and specifically this now, this chapter here talks about what is to take place when they gather as a family.
[time=2206] And Paul says, and I think this is very significant, look at the first phrase there, first of all, does it say second of all, does it say third of all, does it say fourth of all, when you gather, he says to Timothy, when your church body, there in Ephesus is together, I urge first of all that in treaties and prayers and petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of how many men say it for kings and all who are in authority so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life and all godliness and dignity.
[time=2242] Well, you might ask, well, what are those prayers to be about?
[time=2246] What kind of prayer is he referring to there?
[time=2248] Well, just keep reading.
[time=2251] This is good that you would, first of all, as you gather, pray and make in treaties for all men, this is good and acceptable and the side of God our Savior who verse four desires all men to be what?
[time=2264] Say it, saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=2270] Paul reminds Timothy that we are to pray evangelistically if you will, you and I, I should be privately and personally, I believe in you as well, but publicly, of all this is true about eternity, we should be praying and begging God to work and move in the hearts of those that are far from God,
[time=2299] praying that they would be saved.
[time=2301] You know what I honestly think the question on this point is this.
[time=2304] And again, I kind of wrote this and thought this through for me, the shoe fits, you know, jump in here with me, but I just, I think the real question on this point is, Kelly, do you, I just wrote down Kelly, do you really care enough?
[time=2319] Do I really, I mean, really?
[time=2322] Do I really care enough about people far from God to pray for them, to beg God for their hearts and lives to be transformed and to beg God for that transformation again and again and again with all that we've studied about heaven, is there anything going on at the heart level in me that thinks about these things that considers these souls and longs for them to embrace that eternal hope we just discussed?
[time=2355] Now let me just say this to you to be clear on this.
[time=2358] It's one of the great, and I think I think this now at 44, it used to drive me nuts at 34.
[time=2364] It's one of the great mysteries and tensions of the scriptures that I enjoy today.
[time=2370] A lot of folks try and figure this one out.
[time=2372] I've stopped and I just enjoy it.
[time=2375] And here's what I'm referring to.
[time=2376] Why do we pray for God?
[time=2378] Let's just be clear on this.
[time=2379] Why do we pray to God for the redemption and salvation of others?
[time=2384] Because answer, because scripture is so very clear that it is God and only God who brings what?
[time=2391] Who brings salvation?
[time=2394] Amen, nods your heads, that's the truth.
[time=2397] God and God alone saves, period.
[time=2401] Scripture, however, is also very, so you should pray.
[time=2407] You and I, I believe, should be on our knees privately and corporately, praying for those that don't know Him.
[time=2416] Scripture, however, is also very clear that in God's redemptive process that He put together, that He rolled out, that there is more for us to do than just pray.
[time=2429] That's right, a heart willing to pray for those searching is a heart that should be willing to extend a hand to those searching, a heart that is willing to pray for those searching as a heart that should be willing to walk across a backyard, or a heart that would be willing to walk across a ball field, or a heart that would be willing to walk across a neighborhood to pursue a redemptive friendship, because you really care enough about their eternity, a heart that's willing to pray for those searching as a heart that would be willing to take a meal to or invite someone to church.
[time=2469] It's one of the great mysteries, like I said, of Scripture.
[time=2473] God is the one who saves, yet He establishes us as, as really as you read the Scriptures, it's not like just a part of the, He establishes you and I as integral to the process.
[time=2486] And I realize He didn't have to, but He has.
[time=2489] Jesus didn't say in the great commission of Matthew 28, you just pray and I'll make disciples of all the nations teaching them.
[time=2499] Did He?
[time=2502] You know, He said you, He said you go obviously empowered by God, obviously led by God.
[time=2508] He said you go, you go and make disciples, you teach them all that I have commanded.
[time=2514] Romans 10, 13 and 14, what a powerful reminder
[time=2520] of what can at times just seem crazy.
[time=2524] Romans 10, 13 says for, in the verse prior to this, it says that those who call on the name of the Lord will be saved, and then it says again for whoever will call will be saved, how then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed, and how will they believe in Him whom they have not heard, and how will they hear without a preacher, the word there, we've talked about that before, the word there means communicator.
[time=2548] That could be you, it could be me, it could be in this setting, it could be at the break room.
[time=2552] But here's the point, you and I look at that, and with our proper theology of God and who He is and how salvation works, we could on one hand say, wait a minute, how will they hear without a preacher, you could just tell them God, 'cause you're God, and you're the author of salvation, you don't need a preacher, you just need you, you just do it, and He says I could do it, but I don't do it that way.
[time=2574] What I'm saying is I wanna have you in the process.
[time=2579] I want you communicating, I want you sharing, I want you serving, I want you walking across the street, I want you living out and articulating your faith.
[time=2591] I think we should pray more,
[time=2597] in light of all we've learned about heaven and hell.
[time=2600] I think we should be on our knees, and then I think we should get up off our knees and go live redemptively, go speak redemptively, go serve those.
[time=2613] The reality of eternity should move you and me to daily regular redemptive living.
[time=2620] You know, a few weeks ago, Corbin gave you an idea.
[time=2624] I was here that morning and he gave you, we passed out a card and he told you about how a couple years ago somebody on our staff, a staff employee here had in a prayer meeting we had had given us a card and invited us to fill that card out with 10 names of people that we knew who we loved and cared for that didn't know the Lord.
[time=2642] That hadn't yet at that time bowed the knee of their hearts and submission to him and that gal encouraged us that day to begin praying for them and to be mindful of them and to put that card in our Bibles and to make copies of that card and put it on our desk and many of us did that and there began in us as we gave ourselves to that kind of a discipline, this amazing sense of how very important it really was to think in that way and to function in that way and I would just ask you this morning, did you keep that card?
[time=2677] Do you even know 10 that you could write down,
[time=2684] that you could pray for personally?
[time=2686] Maybe you wanna start with five.
[time=2688] But I think the reality my friends of heaven and hell should lead you and I to pray for those and to pursue those far from him thirdly and lastly, I think I should enlight of all that's true about heaven.
[time=2706] I think I should focus more.
[time=2709] I think my life and my heart and my ministry and my days should be more intentional, more focused.
[time=2724] You see in Philippians three that spiritual maturity should bring great focus and purpose to life.
[time=2731] It really should look what Paul says in Philippians three, he says in verse 12, "Not that I have already obtained it "or have already become perfect, "but I press on so that I may lay hold of that, "for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus." "There was something coming that Paul wanted to get to." And he goes on and he says in verse 13, "Brother and I do not regard myself "as having laid hold of it yet." Now everybody in the room say these next few words, go.
[time=2764] But one thing I do, repeat it.
[time=2769] But one thing I do, again, but one thing I do.
[time=2779] Forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead.
[time=2783] He says, "I press on toward the goal "for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus." Now look at 15, this is great.
[time=2797] Let us therefore, as many as are, and in your NIV it will say mature.
[time=2805] Am I right?
[time=2807] In your NIV it will say, let us therefore, as many as are perfect, as many as are mature have this attitude.
[time=2816] As you and I grow in our faith, as we become more aware of heavenly realities, he says, with our maturity, more and more so, your mindset and mine will be, watch this, this one thing I do.
[time=2836] And you and I, my friends, live in a culture where there are 57 things to do right now.
[time=2843] If all that really lasts, if all that really matters in the end, right?
[time=2852] Everything that doesn't matter in the end is gonna what?
[time=2854] It's gonna burn, we talked about that.
[time=2856] The earth is gonna be, and everything in it, and everything about it that's not eternal, that's not gonna last, is gonna be scorched.
[time=2865] If all that really lasts, and all that really matters is God's will, and God's kingdom, and eternal issues, then what Paul says here is, I'm just gonna be about furthering that.
[time=2878] I'm just going to be primarily about furthering that,
[time=2884] his will, his kingdom, one thing.
[time=2888] Now I'll work, don't forget, many of you know this, some of you may not, Paul made tense, right?
[time=2896] I mean, what do you do?
[time=2897] You teach, you work in a factory, you own a business, you're at home, you work night shift at a restaurant, I mean, we all have things that we do, Paul made tense, and when he says this one thing I do, again, don't forget, he was faithful to his job.
[time=2916] I'll work, pay my bills and my taxes, but I will not, don't miss this, I will not be consumed by or owned by the futility of this place and its pursuits.
[time=2934] Heaven and all that comes with eternity should bring focus to my living, intentionality to my time, my talent, my treasure, this one thing I do.
[time=2946] I need some help at times on this front.
[time=2954] How about you?
[time=2955] I wrote down some questions, why am I still so scattered at times?
[time=2962] Why do I still allow what doesn't last and what isn't eternal to distract me so often?
[time=2971] More often than you would guess, I'd be embarrassed for you to know how many times I'm distracted.
[time=2982] Why for some in the room have you tried to make following Christ honoring God with your living just a spoke on the wheel?
[time=2993] You with me there, there's a wheel, there's all these spokes, there's the hub and why do we continue to try and make our life with him just simply part of what we do?
[time=3005] He's not just part of what we, it's not what he's called you and I too.
[time=3012] He is to be that one, that central hub, that one thing we do to be about his will.
[time=3019] Do your job, go to school, have your family, enjoy your hobbies, you can do that and be focused and have in his eyes and those who live life around you, it can clearly be evidence that you are about really at the end of the day one thing.
[time=3034] Why is there still competition for my devotion?
[time=3042] Just one thing I do with my millions.
[time=3047] Think about it, whoever you are.
[time=3051] You may be here in the room, you may be watching on the broadcast with your millions or your 850 an hour with your business, with your family,
[time=3064] with your team, with your classroom, with your practice, be it legal or medical, with your friends, with your physical relationship, with a boyfriend or girlfriend, with your time, with your investments, with your marriage, are you going to be clearly about him?
[time=3081] Are you going to be clearly about that one thing,
[time=3087] his will, his kingdom, his plans and not yours?
[time=3092] I think about the disciples, you want a really good example
[time=3099] of this, it's just a great, it's kind of a broad big picture but you think about it for a moment.
[time=3103] If you studied the life of the disciples, it's a very interesting study.
[time=3107] If you just go to the gospels and read about the disciples prior to the cross, just go back and look at how they lived, just go back and look at how they thought, go back and look at how they asked, go back and look at how the disciples interacted with each other, how they interacted with Jesus, just look at the disciples and the condition of their life and their thought patterns prior to the cross.
[time=3131] And then you look at those men after the cross.
[time=3137] And what you see prior to the cross is bumbling, fumbling guys who weren't on the same page asking all the wrong questions, all the wrong ways, a little hint here and there of them sort of kind of getting it but my goodness.
[time=3151] And then you come to the cross and then you look at them after the cross and what you see then are martyrs.
[time=3158] What you see then, because of all they realized
[time=3164] and all they saw about eternity, right?
[time=3167] What you see then are men who gave their lives to one thing,
[time=3173] this one thing they did.
[time=3175] And you, my friends, and I have seen the very same thing.
[time=3181] We have seen the very same Lord.
[time=3184] Eternal life should bring great clarity and focus to the way I view and approach all of my life.
[time=3194] Now let me just ask if you would to just bow your heads and if you would just close your eyes and let me just share this with you.
[time=3203] I'm so thankful for the effort that Corbin and the team made this morning to share with you in song and in written word, the gospel.
[time=3212] And let me just say this to you before we go.
[time=3215] With reference to that hope that we mentioned earlier, my friends, please remember we've been telling you this for a few weeks, I wanna just say it to you again.
[time=3225] That hope, that future confidence of that future fulfillment, that joy that could be eternally yours, you will not experience.
[time=3238] If you have not bowed with great humility and gratitude, if you have not bowed the knee of your heart to him, if you have not fully surrendered yourself to him, your heart and your life, if you have not accepted the gift of forgiveness and eternal life that he made available, has made available to you by virtue of what he did on the cross and in the tomb, then you're not his.
[time=3271] Then you have rejected eternal life and instead of being redeemed, you stand condemned.
[time=3278] And I wanna just give you the opportunity this morning.
[time=3282] Again, you might be listening on the broadcast, you may be here in this room, you may be watching online.
[time=3287] In your own way, from your own heart, in your own words, if you were willing and if you were ready ever to just communicate to him your desire to be his and to be in life giving eternity altering relationship with him, you would just need to, from your heart, communicate to him something like this.
[time=3309] God, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3312] I know that left to myself, I will and have been my whole life sinning and I know God that my sin separates me from you.
[time=3325] No, God, I know it separates me from you today and God, I know it will separate me from you for all of eternity if I don't respond.
[time=3336] And Father, God, I want to win this moment.
[time=3342] I wanna thank you for the gift of your son, for the sacrifice that he made.
[time=3347] God, I realize that his sacrifice for me is the only thing that gives me hope and life and forgiveness and I today in this moment with you, God, I accept that gift.
[time=3360] And having accepted that gift, God, I want you to know I am committing myself.
[time=3366] I am surrendering myself to you, to grow in you, to walk with you, to obey you.
[time=3372] And God, thank you for my friends that know you, thank you for this church that would be willing to come alongside me in this new relationship and walk with you.
[time=3382] Oh, God, thank you.
[time=3384] For redeeming me, for saving me.
[time=3388] And for those of you in the room that know him,
[time=3395] what an opportunity for you and I to think about applying these truths about heaven to the everyday of life.
[time=3404] I pray you'll come back next week and listen as Mitch takes us through one final study.
[time=3410] Oh, Father, God, we are so grateful for your word and so thankful for you and your gift of life.
[time=3416] Father, God, I pray that those who shared those thoughts, who said those words, God, who proclaimed their love and devotion to you this morning.
[time=3426] Oh, God, we thank you for that.
[time=3427] There are many of us in the room that really do care, really do care.
[time=3432] So many of us here that care about people far from you and when they come into relationship with you, God, we are so grateful.
[time=3443] And we pray, God, that you would give those new believers today, those new Christ followers.
[time=3448] We pray you'd give them courage and strength.
[time=3450] We pray you'd bring others to walk alongside them.
[time=3453] Oh, God, we pray that you would give them victory in the days to come.
[time=3456] I pray, God, that they would speak up.
[time=3459] I pray that they would let us know.
[time=3460] I pray that they would share their decision with a good friend.
[time=3464] And God, I pray you'd bring us back next week to marvel one more time in this great truth of this amazing eternity that you have planned for those that know you.
[time=3478] Thank you for this time together.
[time=3480] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3484] (upbeat music)
