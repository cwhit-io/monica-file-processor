[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[time=28] and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
[time=38] "Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age." Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=74] "Take my heart and lay it down at the feet of you who's crowned and take my life."
[time=102] "And let him go and lift it to you who's strong."
[time=118] "And I will worship your Lord, only your Lord, and I will bow down before you, only your
[time=145] Lord, take my friends, take my fear, for all I have, I'm leaving here, in all my hopes,
[time=160] in all my dreams, in all my delights, in my everything I will, and I will worship your
[time=175] Lord, only your Lord, and I will bow down before you, only your Lord, and I will worship
[time=195] your Lord, only your Lord, and I will bow down before you, only your Lord."
[time=214] "It's just you and me here now, it's only you and me here now, it's just you and me here
[time=254] here now, I will worship your Lord, only your Lord, and I will bow down before you, only
[time=279] your Lord, when I get where I'm going, on the far side of the sky, the first thing that
[time=308] I'm going to do is spread my wings and fly, I'm going to land beside a light and run my
[time=318] fingers through his pain, where I might find out what it's like to ride a drop of rain,
[time=329] when I get where I'm going, there'll be only happy tears, I will share the sins and struggles
[time=342] I have carried on these years, and I'll leave my heart open, I could love and have no fear,
[time=355] yeah, when I get where I'm going, cry for me down here, I'm going to walk with my grand-daddy
[time=373] and he'll match me step for step, and I'll tell him how I missed him every minute since
[time=381] he left, and then our hook is neck, yeah, when I get where I'm going, there'll be only happy
[time=394] tears, I will share the sins and struggles I have carried on these years, and I'll leave
[time=404] my heart open, I could love and have no fear, yeah, when I get where I'm going, don't cry
[time=419] for me down here, so much bread and so much darkness, in this world we're stopping through,
[time=431] all these questions I can answer, so much work to do, but when I get where I'm going, and
[time=445] I see my maker's face, I'll stand forever in the light, his amazing grace, here when I
[time=465] get where I'm going, there'll be only happy tears, I'll love and have no fear, I will
[time=494] have no fear, yeah, when I get where I'm going, there'll be only happy tears, I will share
[time=520] it.
[time=527] Thank you, Marty and Joy, would you pray with me?
[time=532] God, I just pray for the heart of every person in this room, we've all come in with different
[time=544] baggage, some are great successes, and some are great trials, some of us are, marriages
[time=558] might be struggling, our finances might be floundering, our careers might be on a roller
[time=567] coaster ride, maybe we had something just this morning that sort of made us feel a little
[time=576] empty inside.
[time=577] The one thing we do know is that the Bible says that you examine the heart, and you're
[time=585] here right now, to examine thoughts, the choices, the feelings, the prayers of each person here,
[time=594] and I just pray, God, that you reveal to us what we need revealed, and that each person
[time=602] here would be willing to be restored by you, our restorer, our pray, God, that we'll be
[time=610] open to your invitation today, in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=618] Good morning, I've got a question for you, have you ever received an extravagant invitation?
[time=626] And did you accept it or reject it?
[time=631] Have you ever received an extravagant invitation?
[time=635] And did you accept it or did you reject it?
[time=639] I have a modern day parable I'd like to share with you kind of opens the door for what we're going to discuss this morning.
[time=646] To their amazement, a young struggling couple received in the mail an extravagant invitation from a prominent couple in their community to join them on a vacation to Maui.
[time=658] The details from the written invitation included a description of each couple's travel accommodations.
[time=664] Reserve for the young couple was the following, first-class airline seats, a 12-cylinder
[time=670] Ferrari to drive during their stay.
[time=680] The inviting couple would travel in the rear of the aircraft, drive a Chevrolet in Palace,
[time=692] they had a modest franchise hotel, eat at fast food restaurants where bathing suits, shorts, and t-shirts.
[time=698] From bottom of the invitation read, please RSVP.
[time=705] After a domestic conflict, the couple agreed that they could not accept the gift and they
[time=711] sent back their response to climbing the offer.
[time=714] That weekend after a Sunday jog, the young husband routinely picked up his copy of the local newspaper only to be astonished by the front page story featuring how the successful
[time=724] dot-com billionaire couple had sent the extravagant invitation to everyone in their community
[time=731] and only a relative few had responded affirmatively.
[time=738] The couple said that they were amazed at the responses which fell into two different styles of declining.
[time=743] One was an embarrassed, shaming, shaming response that saw the offers away for the couple to
[time=749] power up on the less fortunate.
[time=752] The second featured a desire to compensate the couple in some way for the offer.
[time=757] However, some couples did accept.
[time=762] The article noted how the eccentric businessmen gave the affirmative responses to his marketing staff who completed a demographic analysis of those who accepted the invitation and to their amazement there were no social or economic correlations, none.
[time=777] People from all income and status brackets had accepted.
[time=780] The author of the newspaper article ended the interview with this question to the dot-com executive, "Why do you think some couples said yes while others said no?
[time=793] Why do you think some couples said yes while others said no?"
[time=802] The contemplative executive reflected and said, "I guess there's a reluctance in all
[time=809] of us to accept a gift we feel we did not earn."
[time=815] Personal dignity, I guess.
[time=819] Why are some people willing to accept the gift of eternal and abundant life offered by God through Jesus Christ and others are not?
[time=830] He really asked me to think back on the heaven series and the whole concept and offered today
[time=841] a so what, now what?
[time=844] My question here today is the question that I think Jesus addresses in the parable that he shared 2,000 years ago, and that is, what are you going to do with heaven's invitation?
[time=859] What have you done with heaven's invitation?
[time=864] We're going to look at a parable if you want to turn in your Bibles to Matthew 22 verses
[time=870] 1 through 14, Matthew 22 verses 1 through 14, Jesus says in a context where he's headed
[time=876] to the cross, he's in the temple courts, and he's sparring with the Pharisees and the elders
[time=884] and the teachers of the law who are hard-hearted and proud.
[time=888] We see kind of three movements in the parable.
[time=891] The parable means literally to throw alongside.
[time=894] It's an earthly truth thrown alongside a spiritual one.
[time=898] Scholars think I've shared this with you before, the parables have one, two, maybe three points.
[time=904] We see kind of three movements, kind of three scenes in this parable, and so we're going to share three points, if you will, of the parable.
[time=914] So if you want to turn their Matthew 22 verses 1 through 7, we'll read the seven verses first,
[time=921] what we're going to see first is the invitation rejected, the invitation rejected.
[time=927] Jesus spoke to them again in parable saying the kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
[time=935] He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.
[time=943] He sent some more servants and said, "Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and fat and cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready.
[time=953] Come to the wedding banquet." But they paid no attention and went off, one to his field, another to his business.
[time=964] The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.
[time=969] The king was enraged.
[time=973] He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
[time=979] We're going to see here in this first part the invitation rejected a setting, what kind of gave you the background?
[time=985] We're going to see a little twist, a surprise, and we're going to see the sentence that follows.
[time=990] First of all the setting, a wedding banquet is used as imagery in the Bible for the kingdom
[time=996] of heaven or the kingdom of God more than any other analogy, and just a little definition
[time=1002] of terms.
[time=1003] The kingdom of heaven is God's divine, rain, rule and order in the hearts and lives of people
[time=1010] on this earth now and in the future.
[time=1014] The kingdom of heaven is God's divine, rain, rule and order in the hearts of lives of people on this earth now and in the future.
[time=1023] A kingdom in essence is the effective reach of one's will.
[time=1029] A kingdom is the effective reach of one's will, kind of like on a Sunday in your easy
[time=1038] chair of your recliner when NFL football begins.
[time=1043] You have your remote control and there it is, the effective reach of your will, your kingdom.
[time=1051] The wedding banquet, the king is most likely imagery for God, the son, Jesus, Jesus Christ,
[time=1061] and then the bride would be those who we see, well RSVP, yes, the church.
[time=1068] So this was a 2,000 years ago, here's kind of what happened there, it was a country-wide celebration was a wedding banquet, it was a country-wide celebration that would last for several days, usually up to seven days of partying.
[time=1081] The chef would have to return his fee plus a penalty if he embarrassed the host.
[time=1086] I saw a clip on TV not too long ago about how Wolfgang Puck charges a whole lot of money
[time=1093] for extravagant wedding celebrations.
[time=1095] Can you imagine if Wolfgang kind of messed up and had to give it all back plus a penalty?
[time=1100] That's what happened 2,000 years ago.
[time=1102] The guests would drink undiluted wine, the best stuff from expensive glassware.
[time=1108] Invitations were sent well in advance including the names of others invited, so kind of like
[time=1114] in the parable, the invitation gets sent out.
[time=1117] The invitation included names of others who were invited, Steve Longbrake's going to
[time=1125] be there, Lance Clark's going to be there, the governor's going to be there, the president
[time=1132] might be there if we were looking at modern day terms.
[time=1134] So you had really plenty of notice, plenty of notice to respond, and you also knew who
[time=1143] was coming, okay?
[time=1145] Well, a second invitation then would follow, and it was delivered by a messenger who brought
[time=1151] a personal summons either the day before or the day of the banquet.
[time=1155] That's why in the parable it says, "Hey, it's already come to the banquet."
[time=1162] But there's a twist and a surprise to Jesus' listeners of the parable.
[time=1167] And the surprise is this, the people rejected the king's first and second invitations with
[time=1174] excuses.
[time=1177] The people rejected the king's first and second invitations with excuses, and there
[time=1183] was a sentence.
[time=1184] Now this is interesting.
[time=1185] The sentence was death and fire.
[time=1189] Death and fire was only used in the most serious treason or revolt against the king.
[time=1197] And Jesus might be alluding to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD, which a couple
[time=1203] chapters later he talks about kind of in the same environment.
[time=1207] It's interesting.
[time=1211] Rejecting the invitation of the king warranted the highest level of punishment.
[time=1223] Death and fire rejecting the invitation was considered treason or revolt against the
[time=1231] king.
[time=1233] The king, God, has sent an invitation to each one of us, heaven's invitation, to celebrate
[time=1244] the life of his son, of Christ in us, 24/7, 168 hours a week in whatever we do.
[time=1255] And I want to ask you today what I ask myself as I study this parable.
[time=1262] What excuse are you using to reject heaven's invitation?
[time=1267] What excuse are you using to reject the invitation to the kingdom of God?
[time=1275] God's divine, rain, rule, and order in your heart and your life now and in the future.
[time=1284] What excuse are you using?
[time=1286] Now this is just me, but I think I see a pattern in hard-heartedness throughout the scriptures
[time=1292] and I think I see it again here.
[time=1295] Hard-heartedness or pride is the rejection of the invitation.
[time=1300] Rejecting the invitation is an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=1307] Rejecting the invitation is an external sign of an internal condition because it all goes back to a matter of the heart.
[time=1313] And if you look at this in verse 5, it says there was this group that paid no attention
[time=1319] and they just went off to their field and to their businesses.
[time=1322] I call that proud heart, I think the imagery best for it, is a heart of sand.
[time=1327] It's kind of like the people in the modern day parable that I shared first who thought that maybe the dot-com billionaire couple was powering up on them.
[time=1336] It was an ashamed response, a shaming response, you're trying to power, what are you doing?
[time=1341] You can't help me, what are you doing?
[time=1344] And they don't care, they go off their field, they go off to our business when God sends the invitation.
[time=1351] The other kind of pride is in verse 6 and it's the people who are kind of hard-hearted, I call it a proud heart of stone, it's rigid, hard, doesn't move very easily.
[time=1363] And it takes a severe tool to be shaped just like sand, takes a storm in order to be shaped
[time=1369] and be useful.
[time=1371] And it's kind of like a religious heart that we think that our goodness is going to make
[time=1378] God do something for us, including saving and sanctifying us, that we're going to manipulate
[time=1384] a deity.
[time=1385] We trust in our own good works, going to church, reading the Bible, leading a ministry, all
[time=1393] of which are very good things, that it all goes back to the heart with which you do them.
[time=1400] How we RSVP to the invitation is an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=1408] Whether it's a heart of sand or a heart of stone, it's a hard, hard of pride that rejects
[time=1414] the invitation to the kingdom of God, to the celebration of Christ and everything that you think and everything that you choose and everything that you feel and everything that
[time=1425] you pray with all your time, with all your talent, with all your treasures.
[time=1430] I want to ask you today what excuse are you using to reject heaven's invitation?
[time=1439] Is it manifested in a click?
[time=1442] Is it manifested in a smoke, a toque, a pop of a pill, the use of particular language,
[time=1450] a certain kind of dress, an illicit relationship, or as we talked about, is it manifested in
[time=1458] religious works where at the end of the day it's a hard, hard of stone, and you say, look at me.
[time=1465] Either way, it's an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=1472] It's a hard heart, a proud heart that rejects heaven's invitation.
[time=1479] The second movement that we see in the parable is the invitation re-addressed.
[time=1485] The invitation re-addressed.
[time=1487] Look at verses eight through ten.
[time=1491] Then he said to his servants, "The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come." Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.
[time=1505] So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad.
[time=1513] And the wedding hall was filled with guests.
[time=1517] Heaven's invitation, the invitation rejected, and now the invitation re-addressed.
[time=1522] The King deemed proud rejectors, or the privileged few, as undeserving of his invitation.
[time=1529] These are probably by the context of the parable, Israel's religious leaders, and their self-righteous
[time=1535] followers.
[time=1538] People who saw God as just a big Pharisee.
[time=1543] They were just doing the way they thought God was.
[time=1545] They thought that God closed the doors to all kinds of people, and they were closed on those doors, the people who weren't worthy.
[time=1552] And the King uncharacteristically, in the parable, invited all, any one you find, including
[time=1561] the undeserving and unworthy.
[time=1564] You see it there, both good and bad.
[time=1567] Again, I think, both good stone hearts and bad sand hearts.
[time=1576] Which was talking with me after first service, I had learned from somebody that stone and sand are the same substance, they're just a different aggregate, just a different consistency.
[time=1591] So really, either way you do it, both good or bad, if you reject the invitation to Christ in your life, the Heaven's invitation now, you're doing it with a hard heart.
[time=1602] It's an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=1606] The heart that chooses to remain in control of my own time, my own talent, my own treasures.
[time=1610] But I want you to know that the invitation is addressed to you in spite of your hard-heartedness.
[time=1619] And there seems to be this correlation with people who do RSVP-S to Heaven's invitation
[time=1627] and inviting any one you find.
[time=1631] It seems that when I receive the invitation, when I receive God's grace, when I receive
[time=1638] Christ, when I receive Him, the celebration, the wedding banquet, the celebration of the sun and all of my life, that it translates in inviting any one I find to the celebration.
[time=1653] And so is your life characterized and known by inviting anyone you find to the wedding
[time=1663] banquet, to the celebration of Christ, to the King's celebration of his son?
[time=1668] Is it?
[time=1669] Really?
[time=1670] Right now?
[time=1671] Is it?
[time=1672] Because the answer is an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=1681] If my life isn't characterized and known by inviting anyone I find, if I've made a box
[time=1687] and only certain people fit in the box that the invitation is made to, I probably haven't
[time=1694] received the invitation myself.
[time=1698] I probably have a hard heart, one that's going to maintain control of my time, my talent,
[time=1704] and my treasures.
[time=1705] One that's going to hold on to the four chambers of the spiritual heart, my mind, which is my thoughts, my will which is my choices, my emotions which are my feelings, my spirit
[time=1715] which represent my prayers.
[time=1719] Are you delivering God's open kingdom invitation to anyone you find?
[time=1724] You know, Jesus preached the kingdom's availability to all sinners.
[time=1728] In Matthew 9, verses 12 and 13, we see a continual message repeated by Jesus.
[time=1734] On hearing this, Jesus said, "It's not the sick and healthy who need a doc." I'm sorry.
[time=1738] It's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
[time=1741] But go and learn what this means.
[time=1743] I desire mercy not sacrifice, for I have come, that is so powerful.
[time=1748] I wish we had time to go into that.
[time=1750] When the invitation's by grace, I can't earn it.
[time=1756] That's why he desires mercy not sacrifice.
[time=1759] I'm not going to add anything to the atonement of another in Christ.
[time=1765] I'm depending on the atonement of another, God's grace, God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=1770] It's an acronym.
[time=1771] God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=1773] And Jesus says, "For I have not come to call the righteous but sinners."
[time=1780] People who get it, both good and bad, anyone you find, are you delivering God's open kingdom
[time=1788] invitation to anyone you find?
[time=1792] A guy who I've been friends with for probably six or seven years, he's managed Tommy Walker's ministry.
[time=1798] We've had several worship concerts here and we've helped other ministries and we've helped kids in need.
[time=1804] On the last concert we had, we helped a group of adults and children in the Philippines who live in a dump.
[time=1811] They live in the dumps of Manila.
[time=1816] And they survive by being scavengers.
[time=1819] Some have jobs, but they mainly survive by being scavengers.
[time=1823] What we did in our last Tommy Walker concert is we helped those kids get a Christian education
[time=1832] or a public school education.
[time=1834] That's where our dollars went from the concert, from the gifts.
[time=1837] And they would surrender their lives to Christ.
[time=1839] It's really cool.
[time=1840] And then they'd go back and evangelize their parents.
[time=1843] They would bring the invitation back to their parents.
[time=1846] So he asked me several months ago and I had to pray about it because it was really hard
[time=1852] for me to consider.
[time=1853] He says, "Would you come and do an outreach to those kids in the dump.
[time=1858] There's this basketball court that was recently built by a church, a Catholic church." And he said, "We'd like to do a concert and have you speak two different nights.
[time=1867] We're going to do a DVD to bring the need to other people.
[time=1874] All groups can watch it and they can connect with the music that will be on it, with the teaching that will be on it, and then they can connect to the compassion, to the need." So I prayed and prayed about that and I thought about it.
[time=1885] See, I lived 20 years of traveling almost every single weekend, plus during the week.
[time=1891] And I don't think God's calling me because of the toll that took in my family with four girls to a life of a whole lot of travel.
[time=1900] But everything just seemed to line up, the person who was leading it, how I was going
[time=1906] to be used, our schedules.
[time=1909] And so I'm going to go to the Philippines in a few weeks and I'm going to share the
[time=1916] message.
[time=1917] Because when I talk to him about this, he said, "Share that and I'm going to share the message of heaven's invitation to them." The God is saying, "Come." He's inviting anyone you find.
[time=1928] And part of this parable, part of what it's done is a work in me to continue to try to
[time=1934] live alive, to invite anyone I can find.
[time=1939] But I don't always have it right.
[time=1941] And I just want to ask you the same challenging question.
[time=1944] Are you delivering God's open kingdom invitation to anyone you find?
[time=1949] It's an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=1953] Third, what we see, not only invitation rejected, heaven's invitation readressed.
[time=1960] We see heaven's invitation RSVP.
[time=1963] Look at chapter 22 verses 11 through 14.
[time=1967] But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
[time=1973] Friend he asked, "How did you get in here without wedding clothes?" The man was speechless.
[time=1980] When the king told the attendants, "Tie him hand and foot and throw him outside in the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of tea." For many are invited, but few are chosen.
[time=1997] You look at that, you say, "Well, that seems kind of harsh." "King, I don't get it." It's because the guy came in and leave eyes and some flip flops.
[time=2007] What's the big deal?
[time=2008] I thought you can dress any way you want when you go to church or a celebration.
[time=2013] Well, 2,000 years ago, and I saw some examples of 4,000 years before that, best old garments
[time=2020] were customarily provided by the king.
[time=2024] The king provided your clothes to come to the wedding banquet, the celebration of his
[time=2030] son.
[time=2031] Even Herod the Great provided attendees with clothes for some of his banquets.
[time=2036] The man not wearing wedding clothes was offered them, and yet had proudly rejected them.
[time=2044] An external sign of an internal condition, an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=2056] In Isaiah, it says in 64, 6, it says, "Our righteousness," but here it is.
[time=2063] All of us have become like one who is unclean.
[time=2067] All our righteous acts are like filthy rags.
[time=2073] We all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind, our sins sweep us away.
[time=2080] RSVP means respond, see what we'll play.
[time=2083] Respond.
[time=2084] It comes from the French.
[time=2085] Respond, if you please.
[time=2087] And each one of us does respond to the king's invitation, and we respond with either a proud
[time=2093] heart, whether it's stone or sand, stone, I'll earn it, I'll pay it back, I'm really
[time=2100] good, or sand, or whatever.
[time=2105] Just whatever.
[time=2106] I'm going to go about my business, go back to my field, go do my thing.
[time=2110] But it's an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=2112] But look what Isaiah says two verses later in verse 8.
[time=2116] It gives a different substance, a different imagery, an imagery that also comes from the ground.
[time=2122] Yet, O Lord, you are our Father, we are the clay, you are the potter, we are all the work
[time=2129] of your hand.
[time=2132] Clay.
[time=2134] Clay comes from the ground.
[time=2136] Clay is imagery here for humility, I want you to write that down, humility, humility.
[time=2143] Humility is a condition of the heart.
[time=2145] A condition of the heart.
[time=2148] Humility literally means to bend my knees to another, to make myself lower than another.
[time=2154] So it always has an object.
[time=2156] So what the king is looking for with his invitation, heaven's invitation to you right now, is humility toward him and his son.
[time=2167] You take all four chambers of your heart, your mind, your will, your emotions and your spirit and you say to God to Christ, I can't, you can't, I can't pay for my sin, you can.
[time=2179] I can't be free from the power of sin in Christ, you know, you can.
[time=2185] And so with my mind, I think this, I believe this.
[time=2189] With my will, I choose this.
[time=2192] With my emotions, I feel this, I want this, there's an affection toward this.
[time=2197] And with my spirit, my prayers, I pray this.
[time=2202] So it's all of my heart, all of my heart, humbled to all of God.
[time=2210] Don't miss that.
[time=2212] And with that internal condition comes the external signs, my time, my talent and my treasures.
[time=2221] Humanity and humanity come from the same Latin root, humus, it means literally from the ground.
[time=2230] It's kind of like sand and stone also come from the ground, but they don't get it.
[time=2236] Humility does because it fully surrenders.
[time=2238] It says, I can't, you can, to the potter who shapes it and continually brings it back to the center of the wheel, back to Christ, heaven's invitation brings you back to the celebration of his son and you can RSVP, yes, or you can accept it or you can RSVP, no.
[time=2256] Once again, yes is saying, I can't, you can.
[time=2260] I can't free myself from the penalty of sin.
[time=2262] You can't.
[time=2263] I can't free myself from the power of sin.
[time=2265] You can.
[time=2266] I surrender to you as Savior and Lord.
[time=2270] Stone kind of says, I can and you can.
[time=2273] We'll get it together.
[time=2274] We'll get it paid for together.
[time=2276] The sand sort of says, I can't and you can't and you just go about your own business.
[time=2280] What are you talking about?
[time=2281] We're giving that guilt-shamed stuff, quit powering up on me.
[time=2285] But then we have this challenging little statement at the end of the parable because
[time=2291] we see the one who refused the king's wedding clothes again.
[time=2294] He's cast out.
[time=2295] We see that.
[time=2296] That rejection of heaven's invitation, an RSVP of rejection, an RSVP of no means you're
[time=2302] not in the celebration.
[time=2306] The RSVP for entrance in the kingdom is humility.
[time=2310] It's humbly receiving the righteous clothing of Christ.
[time=2314] We see this difficult line at the end for many who are invited but few are chosen.
[time=2318] I want you to just go with me a little bit further into humility so we can understand that last statement.
[time=2325] Look at what Jesus said in Matthew 18 verses 1 through 4.
[time=2330] Matthew 18 verses 1 through 4.
[time=2332] At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Hey, who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" He called a little child and had him stand among them and he said, "I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven, the celebration of the king's son." You'll never enter unless you come like a child.
[time=2353] Well, what does he mean?
[time=2354] Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2363] Talking about this righteous clothing, look what Romans 13, 14 says, it's about the atonement of another.
[time=2368] It says, "Rather clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, internally with your heart and it will be an external sign when you do this and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature." Paul reiterated this in Galatians 3 verses 26 and 27.
[time=2384] You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
[time=2387] When you humble yourself to him, you become a son.
[time=2391] You enter the celebration of the king and the son.
[time=2395] For all of you who are baptized into Christ, when you said yes, when you RSVPed yes, when you accepted Christ and you live in the kingdom of heaven here and now and in the future, you have clothed yourselves with Christ.
[time=2406] You have immersed all of your life, all of your time, all of your talent, all of your treasures in him.
[time=2413] There are many are invited, but few are chosen.
[time=2417] Here we go.
[time=2418] Many is polo-i in Greek.
[time=2421] It's a common, inclusive expression in Israel.
[time=2424] It is typically translated as all or everyone and the Hebrew equivalent is translated the
[time=2432] same in the Old Testament.
[time=2433] The king invites all to the celebration of the kingdom of his son but chooses only those
[time=2440] who humble themselves to the righteous clothing of Christ.
[time=2444] How will you today RSVP to heaven's invitation?
[time=2450] How will you RSVP to the kingdom of heaven, the celebration of the son in every part of your heart, every chamber of your heart and every resource of your life?
[time=2460] What would it look like?
[time=2462] What would it look like to RSVP yes and humble your mind and have your thoughts celebrate
[time=2469] Christ, the kingdom, the wedding banquet of the son?
[time=2473] What would it look like in your life if you would humble your will and your choices would
[time=2479] reflect the celebration of Christ and the kingdom of heaven in your life?
[time=2484] What would it look like if you would humble your emotions and your feelings and you would want to attend an RSVP yes, the celebration of Christ in your life?
[time=2495] What would it look like to humble your spirit, to RSVP yes with your prayers and pray today I can't, I can't free myself from the penalty and the power of sin, Christ you can't.
[time=2506] What would it look like today, today with your spirit with all four chambers of your heart to say I can't you can't to bend the knees of your heart to Christ and receive and
[time=2517] say yes RSVP yes to the celebration of the son, the kingdom of heaven in your life.
[time=2525] What would it look like with your time and your calendar?
[time=2528] What would your appointments look like?
[time=2529] What would your schedule look like?
[time=2531] How would that change if you would RSVP yes today to the celebration of the son?
[time=2537] What would it look like with your talent?
[time=2539] How would you use the gifts that God has given you, your gift of leadership, your gift of teaching, your gift of administration, your gift of wisdom, your gift of giving?
[time=2547] How would you use your gift, your gift of helps, your gift of mercy, your gift of comfort of compassion, how would you use those?
[time=2557] How would you use your treasures?
[time=2558] What would it look like if you would RSVP yes in your treasures today?
[time=2563] What would your checkbook look like?
[time=2564] What would your savings account look like?
[time=2566] What would your investment portfolio look like?
[time=2568] What would your house look like?
[time=2570] What would it look like if you would RSVP yes today to the celebration of the son in your
[time=2578] life?
[time=2579] 24/7, 168 hours a week, it's an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=2588] If you're here today, you've been invited to the celebration of the king's son.
[time=2595] You've been invited to have the kingdom of heaven transform your heart and transform your life.
[time=2601] And probably the most dangerous place to be is to embrace Jesus as an example, but maintain
[time=2609] control of your own life and miss out on heart transformation, miss out on the celebration
[time=2616] of the kingdom, miss out on heaven on the other side, all because you wouldn't humble
[time=2623] all four chambers of your heart to Christ.
[time=2626] You wouldn't humble all three resources of your life, your time, your talent, and your treasures to Him.
[time=2634] You had a hard, hard stone, or you had a hard, hard sand, and you said, "You know what?
[time=2640] I'm RSVP and no.
[time=2643] I'm out because I want to hold on to this." What would it look like in your marriage if you would RSVP yes?
[time=2651] A lot of you walked in here today and you're about ready to call it quits.
[time=2657] What would that look like if both of you would actually humble your hearts?
[time=2663] I'm reading through the Bible like I asked you to do and I read through 1 Peter just recently and it's interesting.
[time=2669] Chapter 5 verse 5 in a passage we talk about a lot.
[time=2672] It says, "All of you, all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward each other."
[time=2679] See, there's this idea that when I humble my heart to Christ and I start inviting anyone I find, I model that in my relationships and I humble myself to my wife.
[time=2691] My wife humbles herself to me.
[time=2694] Have you missed out on that?
[time=2697] Maybe today's the day that that changes.
[time=2700] Students are going back to school.
[time=2702] I've been there.
[time=2704] Maybe RSVPing yes means you don't do physically what you're being challenged to do in a relationship.
[time=2711] Maybe it means not cheating.
[time=2714] Maybe it means getting your SAT schedule and getting them done.
[time=2718] Maybe it means the way you conduct yourself on the athletic field in the classroom.
[time=2722] What goes on in your heart towards your teachers?
[time=2727] Some of you are on your last go around here and then you're going to go off and experience that autonomy of adulthood and college and career.
[time=2737] What would it look like if you would RSVP yes in school?
[time=2742] What would it look like if you RSVPed yes to the Kingdom of Heaven in your business?
[time=2747] In your career?
[time=2749] What would your expense reports look like?
[time=2751] How would your relationships be?
[time=2753] What would happen when somebody unsuspected comes to your door?
[time=2757] Would they be a hindrance or would it now become a divine appointment?
[time=2760] How would your business and your career look like if you RSVPed yes?
[time=2764] Would God ask you to change it?
[time=2767] Would God ask you to stay the course if you would RSVP yes?
[time=2771] What would it look like if you RSVPed yes to the King's celebration in everything that
[time=2778] you do in your ministry, in what you do here and what you do outside here?
[time=2784] What would it look like if you would RSVP yes to the King's invitation, to Heaven's invitation?
[time=2792] Well, I think at the end of the day, a clay heart gets transformed and it begins to reflect
[time=2800] the fingerprints of the potter and we'll look a little more like Christ because it won't
[time=2807] be us, it will be Christ in us doing the transforming and that's how we humble ourselves to others.
[time=2815] There's this passage, if I read through 1 Peter, I just read through Hebrews 2, at the end of Hebrews 11 and I've asked the team to come back up for one last song and there's
[time=2829] this passage at the end of Hebrews 11 that says all those great people of faith that
[time=2836] lived before Christ, they didn't really get to see the real benefit but there is a real
[time=2844] benefit and we live 2,000 years in the wake of that and that's the ultimate clarity of
[time=2851] God in Christ and that we can have in Christ in us celebrating 24/7 Christ in me and all
[time=2857] four chambers of my heart and all three resources of my life and it's kind of like this, we're going to look at some pictures that you sent of loved ones who have gone on to be with
[time=2869] the Lord and what I'd like you to do when you think about that, I'd like you to realize they RSVP yes and they're there but I want you to think of this too, a guy had become
[time=2884] a friend and done some business with, after about a year of discussions, he's sitting down at my house and I said so what's heaven's imitation mean to you and he says well I think it's all about going to heaven when I die and have the relationships I have, you know I'll go see the people who've gone before me and all that kind of stuff and I said I had a Bible in my hand I said let me just ask you this, what if you think the message of this book said you can have the ultimate heaven has to offer right now, he said well that would
[time=2913] change everything and see he had grown up in a religious background, he had gone from
[time=2921] that heart of stone to heart of sand and he had an addictive behavior that had been taking his toll on his business, had destroyed, helped destroy his marriage and here he is now with
[time=2932] the heart of sand sand that would change everything and there with me, the Holy Spirit takes that
[time=2942] heart makes it a heart of clay and he fully surrendered in humility his life to Christ,
[time=2948] just like the people that we're going to see on the screen before us.
[time=2953] I wonder if today you walked in with a little bit of a stone heart and you're holding back
[time=2960] parts of your life from God, it's real simple, you just confess those proud parts, the hard
[time=2966] parts of your heart say I can't you can't you give them to God right now, you just give them to him right now and you come in to the celebration, close with Christ and you live
[time=2978] that out 168 hours a week, there are other of you though who came in today and you've
[time=2984] rejected God your entire life, it's probably a heart of sand but in either case it's been
[time=2991] an external sign of an internal condition, would you say today August 19th I'm putting
[time=2997] a line of sand and stake in the ground and I'm going to humble my heart to Christ, I'm going to clothe myself with Christ, I'm going to humble myself in my life to him, I can't pay for the penalty of my sin, I can't free myself from the power of the sin, he can and would you do that right now, right now as they sing and you watch the people who went before us who RSVP'd yes, would you today RSVP'd yes to the kingdom of heaven, to heaven
[time=3022] and to the celebration.
[time=3052] I have a choice for you, but the reason why I'm broken, the reason why God cries how long
[time=3064] must I wait to read a few, I close my eyes and I see your face, give homes where my heart
[time=3078] is and I'm out of place, Lord won't you give me strength to make it through somehow, I'll
[time=3090] never been more home sick than now, I'll be Lord because I don't understand your ways,
[time=3114] the reason why God never knows, but even if you showed me, the hurt could feel the same
[time=3124] because I'm still here so far away from home and I close my eyes and I see your face, give
[time=3138] homes where my heart is and I'm out of place, Lord won't you give me strength to make it
[time=3150] through somehow, I'll never been more home sick than now, would you give me strength
[time=3189] strength to make it through somehow, I'll never be more home sick than now, would you
[time=3217] I'll never be more home sick than now, would you give me strength to make it through somehow,
[time=3247] I'll never be more home sick than now, I'll never be more home sick than now, I'll never
[time=3293] be more home sick than now, I'll never be more home sick than now, would you give me strength
[time=3302] to make it through somehow, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow, I'll
[time=3313] never be more home sick than now, I'll never be more home sick than now, I'll never be more home
[time=3343] sick than now, I'll never be more home sick than now, I'll never be more home sick than
[time=3367] never be more home sick than now, I'll never be more home sick than now, I'll never be more
[time=3373] home sick, it's worth giving up the religious legal, it's worth it, to RSVP, yes, to the
[time=3381] celebration of Christ in your life 24/7, you know my buddy who surrendered his life to
[time=3387] Christ there at my house, it hasn't been flawless since, but he's got a heart of clay, he's going
[time=3394] a different direction, and that's what God wants for you today is to RSVP, yes, to Christ
[time=3404] in you, the hope of glory, and so the pastors and the elders who are here are going to be
[time=3412] up front, and if today is the day that you want to pray, we'll pray with you, if you
[time=3418] don't even know what to pray and it's hard for you to even articulate what's going on in your life, we'll just come alongside you, and we'll just pray with you because you know what, us too, and then those of you who are RSVPing, yes, I would just invite
[time=3434] you this week to just live in that celebration of Christ in you, whether you're a win-loser
[time=3442] draw on the world side, celebrate Christ, let's pray, and so God may it be so for each
[time=3452] person here, God draw the people to yourself, anybody that you want to have prayer here
[time=3458] at the end, bring them God please, or whatever, to restore marriages, to surrender their
[time=3465] hearts and lives to you, to let go of some hard spots in their heart, and God may they
[time=3473] experience you, the potter, you, the restore, you, the king, Christ in us, pray these things
[time=3483] in Jesus' name, amen.
