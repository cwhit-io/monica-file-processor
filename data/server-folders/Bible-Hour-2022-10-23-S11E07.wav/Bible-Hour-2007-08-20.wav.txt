[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of all news, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age.
[time=49] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=74] I will bless the Lord forever.
[time=101] And I will trust Him over times.
[time=117] And He has delivered me full of fear, and He has set my feet upon me right.
[time=138] And I will not be moved, I'll say out the Lord, You are my King, My strength, My fortune,
[time=164] My strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My
[time=437] strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My
[time=762] strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My
[time=789] strength, My strength, My strength, My strength, My
[time=803] [MUSIC]
[time=808] (audience applauding) - Well, I don't know about you, but, well, actually, I do know about a lot of you, and I know this is true for a lot of you, like it is for the birds these days.
[time=824] This time of year brings about some transitions.
[time=828] This time of year brings about some changes in the way we're living life.
[time=833] For three months or so, we've been living life a certain way, with a certain approach, and now with mid-August, late August, September, beginning of school, the new fall season, all of a sudden, routines, routines and schedules begin to be affected, and we're back into a way of living that really does require, in some ways, a little bit more of a routine than we've been living with for the last few months.
[time=862] Not sure exactly what it looks like in your home.
[time=865] I can imagine, I know, in our home, the whole back-to-school thing, and all that that brings has let us now to a renewed attention and a renewed focus on homework, being done in the evenings, whoever needs a bath or a shower, making sure all that takes place.
[time=883] Bedtimes are all of a sudden, getting observed.
[time=886] You gotta get the alarm set.
[time=887] We gotta get up on time.
[time=889] Breakfast's got to get made, served, cleaned up, pew chores in the morning, get to the backpacks, or where they need to be.
[time=896] Leave the house right around 7.35.
[time=900] And if we're gonna have a successful morning, if they're gonna have a successful morning, that's kinda how that's usually gotta go.
[time=908] That's what the routine of their morning should look like.
[time=912] And it's got me thinking lately, and I was talking with Corbin about this just last week, got me thinking about not only the routine of our home on a weekday morning or a weekday night, thinking about routines gets me thinking about the routine of your life and mine.
[time=933] What should the routine, for instance, what should the routine of our hearts look like?
[time=941] What type of spiritual schedule should I be keeping in my life?
[time=947] What kind of spiritual disciplines should I be practicing in order for me personally to experience and see all that God has for me?
[time=958] What kind of spiritual disciplines should we all be practicing?
[time=962] What kind of spiritual schedules?
[time=964] And I realize that there are many in the room who, like me, don't like schedules.
[time=968] I know there are many of you who, like me, really aren't a fan of routines, but we've all got to, at some point, especially on issues like this, draw some lines and be honest and real and understand that there is a need that you have.
[time=984] And there is a great need that I have in the spiritual dimension of our lives.
[time=990] For there to be a schedule, for there to be some routine, for there to be the practicing of some disciplines that will allow us the full expression of what God intended for you.
[time=1002] And for us, for you individually, for us as a ministry, for this place, what kinds of routines did you and I be mindful of?
[time=1013] It got Corbin and I talking about it.
[time=1015] And he said, you know what, you ought to just, you ought to just open up the scriptures and you ought to just share with the family.
[time=1021] Some of the regular routines, some of the weekly disciplines, if you will, that not only would we not so much expect of you, but really the disciplines in the spiritual dimensions we would want for you.
[time=1035] Be reminded again, please, that we would want God's best for you.
[time=1042] We would want you to experience all that God has for you individually and as a couple and as a family.
[time=1048] And we would want for this collective body to experience all that God has.
[time=1053] And we would want for this collective body to avoid those things that God doesn't have for you and we experience it and/or we avoid it by walking with Him.
[time=1067] And we walk with Him closely and we experience the richness of relationship with Him when there are some disciplines that we can give ourselves to.
[time=1078] And so I don't know if it's the best title, but we just put down a week, a week of following Christ.
[time=1083] Tried to make it as practical as we possibly could, a week of following Christ.
[time=1088] What really, what should it entail?
[time=1091] And I've got four things here for you that we're gonna get to in time.
[time=1095] This is not a chapter and verse deal where you're gonna find these things necessarily mandated in this order, but nonetheless, I stand here this morning with great confidence because these are principles pulled directly from the pages of God's word.
[time=1112] I believe principles intended for you and I to follow, for you and I to give ourselves to.
[time=1119] And in the following of them, in the giving of ourselves to them, I believe we find great reward and great blessing and great joy.
[time=1125] And so I wanna just start in this morning.
[time=1129] Like I said, four things.
[time=1130] And we're gonna begin with what I think is the beginning point.
[time=1134] I think it is the initial place that we begin to experience our relationship with Him.
[time=1140] I think for anybody interested in how it is that we would make our way through a day, anybody interested with respect to how it is we would make our way through a week, I think this is a point at which we must begin this discussion and that point would simply be time with Him.
[time=1157] Would you just write that down time with Him?
[time=1161] Many of you know that over the last year or so, and in the last several months, those of us here at Blackhawk have gone through a very, very, I think profound and very significant, significant as it relates to the life of this family and the life of this ministry in recent months, we gave ourselves to a study of the priesthood of all believers.
[time=1184] We called the series, I'm a priest.
[time=1187] And in that series, many of you learned for the very first time and others of you were reminded of the fact that in relationship with God, we have been ordained, we have been called by the very words of Scripture, a royal priesthood in knowing Him, we are a priest and as a priest, we learned in that series that the very first thing a priest would do, the very foundation of a priest, that which allowed the priest to fulfill his priestly function was that before he went in, did what God called him to do, the priest always met with who?
[time=1227] God.
[time=1228] He got, as we said during the series, he got God all over him.
[time=1233] He was inundated, surrounded by absolutely saturated with God, he would meet with God in the presence of God and then go in and reflect like a mirror God's attributes and God's character to an on-looking world.
[time=1250] This is the very same idea, my friends, and the highest, purest, most significant priest,
[time=1258] who ever walked the face of the earth, our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, models this for us, again and again and again and again.
[time=1268] This time with meeting with, personally, stepping into in a very intimate way into the presence of God, listening and sharing and worshiping, responding and taking
[time=1288] in and connecting.
[time=1290] Let me take you to a few examples of this, our Lord and His time with the Father.
[time=1297] Do you think it's important?
[time=1299] Do you think it should be a monumental priority in your life?
[time=1302] Let's look as we attempt to follow Christ in the everyday of our life.
[time=1306] Let's look and see how Christ came at this.
[time=1308] Go to Mark, chapter one, would you?
[time=1310] Matthew, Mark, second book in the New Testament, just after the book of Matthew, go to Mark, chapter one, flip open there to chapter one, verse 35, would you do that?
[time=1322] Mark, chapter one, verse 35, it says there, in the early morning, Mark one, 35, he had been healing, actually many had been healed
[time=1335] in the previous verses and now that's come to an end and then the next day it says in verse 35, in the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went away to a secluded place and was praying there.
[time=1354] Few things I want you to see about that, as you think about, and as I think about together here, this idea of making it a huge priority and a spiritual discipline and opportunity that you and I would give ourselves to faithfully.
[time=1370] I want you to look at the model here of our Lord, it says here a few things, in the what?
[time=1374] In the what morning?
[time=1375] In the early morning, how early?
[time=1378] While the author tells you there, while it was still what?
[time=1381] Dark, I know many of you aren't morning people.
[time=1384] We've had that discussion, you and I have talked that through, many of you say to me on this subject, I'm just really not a morning person.
[time=1392] I just kind of do better in my mind, you know, at night or at any time other than, you know, the morning and there's a part of me that understands that, I really do, I've kind of wrestled with that myself over the years, but I've come to the point today in my life where I just think fundamentally I agree with the notion that there's something about starting all that's going to transpire, all that's going to be faced, all that's going to be encountered.
[time=1419] I think there's something very foundational about you and I, before we ever get to that stuff, having met with, having spoken with, having read, having listened to, having sung, having worshiped with, having been in the presence of God.
[time=1436] A heart and mind that are prepared to fulfill our priestly function.
[time=1444] When it says in the early morning, while it was still dark, I think there's something to the morning, that's my point there, I think that's significant.
[time=1453] Look at this, it says in the early morning while it was still dark, Jesus what?
[time=1458] God up, come on be honest, I'll be honest if you'll be honest.
[time=1463] How many times have you had that time with God flat on your back for about six minutes and before you know it, it's 38 minutes later?
[time=1471] Hands, come on honesty, thank you.
[time=1474] There's something to, I think, there's something to getting up.
[time=1478] There's something that says this is important.
[time=1481] There's something that says I've got to, I've got to not just do this, I've got to have this.
[time=1485] I want to meet with him.
[time=1488] In the early morning while it was still dark, Jesus got up, look at this, left what?
[time=1494] Say it out loud, left the house, left the house.
[time=1498] Why would he leave the house?
[time=1501] Why might you and I leave the house?
[time=1504] And he didn't just leave the house, no there was great intention, even in that it says he got up left the house and went away to a what?
[time=1512] It's a clued place, now hear me on this.
[time=1514] I know that there may be, especially at an early hour, there may be a secluded place under your roof.
[time=1522] I'm with you on that.
[time=1523] I think that the importance here though is what's laid out, I think it was so important for him to be away from the noise, to be away from the distraction, to be away from the interruption, really to be maybe away from the familiar, maybe you and I can get up and get out of the bed and get over that hurdle, but then we end up in the recliner.
[time=1544] And then we're back to sleep or then we end up on our knees next to the couch in the living room and then there's slobber on the couch.
[time=1550] I mean, maybe I'm just worse off than the rest of you.
[time=1554] I'm just being honest, but I think there's something too.
[time=1556] I wanna get up, I wanna wake up.
[time=1559] I'm gonna even go somewhere, involves a little bit of travel maybe and I'm gonna find a secluded place.
[time=1566] We're having gotten up, having woken up, having traveled, having arrived.
[time=1571] I can be with him in this place and meet with him.
[time=1575] In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus met with the Father.
[time=1583] Go back to Matthew, would you?
[time=1586] Just go back a few pages to Matthew 14.
[time=1591] Would you go there with me?
[time=1592] Look at Matthew 14.
[time=1593] Another example, you know what?
[time=1594] I realized as I began to look through this, we literally could spend 40 minutes straight going verse by verse, by verse, by verse, by verse.
[time=1603] Of examples of our Lord making time to spend with the Father.
[time=1608] Look at Matthew 14.
[time=1611] Matthew 14, 23, it says this.
[time=1617] It says after he had sent the crowds, he had made the disciples in 22, get into the boat and they began to move toward the other side.
[time=1625] We've talked about that before and then in 23, after he had sent the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself.
[time=1635] He goes again to a place.
[time=1638] He goes up to the mountain by himself.
[time=1640] There's the seclusion, there's the isolation to pray.
[time=1644] And when it was evening, he was there alone.
[time=1648] So now we see in Mark 135, in the early morning, he finds it important to get up, to leave the house, to find a place of seclusion.
[time=1657] So he can be with the Father.
[time=1659] Later now, over here in Mark Matthew 14, we see that later in the day in essence, in the evening, after the work is done, after the ministry has taken place in the evening, he finds it important to be alone.
[time=1674] And to find himself in a place of seclusion where he can be with the Father.
[time=1680] Matthew, Mark Luke, go to Luke six real quick.
[time=1684] In the morning, he needed to be with the Father.
[time=1689] Look at Luke six.
[time=1691] Here we find him on the verge of an enormous decision.
[time=1697] A huge, very pivotal place in his ministry.
[time=1700] The selection of the 12 apostles is about to take place.
[time=1705] And it says here in Luke six, 12, it was at this time that he went off to the mountain.
[time=1711] There he goes again.
[time=1712] That he went off to the mountain to pray, and there he goes praying again.
[time=1715] And he spent the, say it out loud, he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
[time=1723] So this time with the Father is pretty important.
[time=1726] We see in Mark 135, he wants to do it in the morning.
[time=1729] We see in Matthew, he wants to do it in the evening.
[time=1732] And now here in Luke with a big decision, he feels the need to do it all night long.
[time=1736] To be with the Father alone in isolation,
[time=1742] praying, communicating, sharing, listening, worshiping.
[time=1746] Being fed, being filled up, being encouraged, being directed.
[time=1749] You say, well, good night, Kelly, you're not really thinking I'm gonna do this all night, long and in the evenings and in the mornings.
[time=1756] I don't know.
[time=1759] You say, and somebody did even after first hour, they said, you know, well, wait a minute, on that whole all night thing, that was Jesus.
[time=1767] To which I said, lovingly it was Jesus.
[time=1774] But don't forget, it was Jesus who was yes 100% divine, but also 100%.
[time=1780] What?
[time=1781] Human.
[time=1782] And in his 100% humanness, which is the one part of him
[time=1788] you and I can identify with, amen?
[time=1790] He was, he needed that time.
[time=1795] He models for us in his humanness.
[time=1797] This utter, here's the word for you, write it down.
[time=1799] His utter dependence.
[time=1802] It is about dependence.
[time=1804] We see it not only in our Lord, we see it also in the Old Testament.
[time=1810] Go back, if you would, to Daniel.
[time=1812] Would you do that after Psalms and Proverbs, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel?
[time=1818] Go to Daniel, flip back there, just before you get to Hosea.
[time=1822] Go to Daniel six, Daniel six, 10.
[time=1826] Time with the Father, time for direction,
[time=1832] time for guidance, time for worship, a time for filling, a time of adoring.
[time=1838] Look at Daniel six, here we have Daniel in chapter six, verse 10, a little backdrop for you.
[time=1844] Most of you know this, Daniel has been serving King Darius faithfully.
[time=1848] And those in other governmental leadership positions have grown incredibly jealous of Daniel.
[time=1856] They want to conspire to see Daniel taken down so they convinced Darius to pass this law that nobody can pray to any other God but their God.
[time=1867] They know Daniel has a habit of, they know Daniel is in the routine of, they know Daniel has it in his heart to meet with his God often.
[time=1877] And they convinced Darius to pass this law.
[time=1879] Daniel finds out about the law.
[time=1882] Now in verse 10, Daniel knew that the document was signed.
[time=1886] He entered his house.
[time=1888] Now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day praying and giving thanks before his God as he had been doing previously.
[time=1904] Special note there, I want you to just take note of previously.
[time=1910] What that says about Daniel isn't that he had just been doing it the previous week.
[time=1917] He had been doing this his whole life.
[time=1919] He had been taught from the earliest of ages.
[time=1924] It's the one reason why he could be kidnapped and taken away to a land 1500 miles away with a crazed king, Nebuchadnezzar, and withstand the pressure and withstand the torment and withstand the temptation.
[time=1936] It's why he had such character all these years in captivity because he had been invested in as a young boy and now had a pattern.
[time=1946] In this case of meeting with his God, he does the same thing.
[time=1950] Look at Daniel nine, you can just write down Daniel nine.
[time=1953] I love this.
[time=1955] Daniel nine three says in Daniel nine 23, excuse me.
[time=1960] Oh, no, nine three.
[time=1961] I want you to see this actually, yeah, turn there.
[time=1965] Daniel nine three, so I gave my attention.
[time=1972] Wow, look at that phrase.
[time=1974] So I gave my attention to the Lord God to seek him by prayer and supplications with fasting, saith, cloth, and ashes.
[time=1987] My friends, you understand, don't you?
[time=1990] That one of, one of the ways in which the enemy
[time=1997] will try again and again and again to penetrate your life.
[time=2002] One of the ways that the enemy will again and again attempt to move you and move me off course, one of the ways and he's so successful at it tragically.
[time=2014] So many times that he attempts to move us away from what's true and right and good is that he distress, say it with me.
[time=2023] He distracts us from the Father.
[time=2028] He distracts us from obedience.
[time=2030] He distracts us from what's right.
[time=2033] He distracts us and moves us away from this road that God has called us to walk.
[time=2039] If I, it's just so clear and you, every one of you can identify with this no matter who you are or what your life looks like 'cause we've all experienced it to some degree with a parent or a coach or a teacher.
[time=2051] I know, for instance, if I wanna communicate something to my two older girls, if I wanna go down the hall back to the back there in Matty and Wesley's room and there's something that's very important that's on my heart that they need to hear me say, now it might just be about the next couple hours, it might just be about dinner that night, it might be about something that I've observed in their life, whatever it's about.
[time=2076] If it's important to me and I wanna communicate it to them and I want them to hear it and take it in, I'll go back to their room.
[time=2083] Now oftentimes when I open the door to their room and they're back there, it's a normal girls room.
[time=2088] Music's playing, stuff's out, conversations are going on, there might be something going on with a few dolls, there might be something going on with a few books and I'll start to talk.
[time=2097] Now here's the deal, you've been there, you start to talk and nobody's what?
[time=2102] Listening.
[time=2104] So oftentimes I'll just say and we'll just do this in our home, we'll just do it, we'll try and do it patiently at first, usually it works, but I'll just say, hey, look at me.
[time=2113] We've talked about that before.
[time=2114] Hey, I just need your eyes for a second, right?
[time=2118] And you all know most of the time what happens when we get their eyes, when we get their eyes and their concentration, oftentimes what gets communicated gets taken in and that's what God desperately wants from you.
[time=2134] Your attention.
[time=2141] So I gave my attention to the Lord God.
[time=2146] David, our Lord, Daniel, Dave, we see the same attitude
[time=2155] in David, this desperate crying out.
[time=2157] Look at Psalm 63 one, Psalm 63 one, oh God, he says, you are my God and I shall seek you earnestly, you know, morning, noon, evening, night, you know, at all times it's implied I will seek you earnestly.
[time=2174] My soul thirsts for you, my flesh yearns for you in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[time=2183] What we see here my friends in the life of our Lord, in the life of Daniel and in the heart of David is a deep ongoing sense of dependence.
[time=2193] They were dependent on the Father, are you?
[time=2199] Are you, are you, are you really?
[time=2202] Does that characterize the way you come at this, the way you come at your days, the way you come at your weeks, the way you come at your moment by moment, are you utterly and deeply dependent on him?
[time=2216] They were dependent upon these times with the Father.
[time=2221] They could not listen, they could not function without it.
[time=2226] And what I want you to see is more than anything here this morning because while this is a familiar topic to many, I think sometimes the whole motivation thing kind of skews it, I want you to sense and understand the deepest part of their motives.
[time=2243] You don't spend time alone with God.
[time=2245] Our Lord didn't spend time alone with the Father.
[time=2249] You and I shouldn't be spending time alone with the Father reading and taking in the Scriptures, praying and connecting with him because we've got it scheduled at 6 a.m.
[time=2260] This is not a scheduling issue.
[time=2263] You spend time with him, those that we've looked at
[time=2271] already this morning, they spent time with him, reading, praying, communicating, taking in God, connecting with him because if they didn't, they were gonna die.
[time=2284] That was the mindset.
[time=2287] That was the attitude.
[time=2290] They couldn't function.
[time=2294] They were gonna die if they didn't get with him.
[time=2299] Psalm 119, we learned so much about this
[time=2305] and we see this modeled so clearly in the person and in the pen of David.
[time=2311] Go to Psalm 119, most of you know it's the longest chapter in all of Scripture and some of you know, others of you may not know that every single verse in this 119th Psalm, the longest Psalm, in the longest chapter in the entire Bible, every single verse is about the Word of God.
[time=2336] Every single verse makes reference to the value and the benefit of and the need and his desperation for the Scriptures in his life.
[time=2348] And when I say to you, you know, that they came at this with this attitude that if they didn't get with him, if they didn't get with what was true, they were gonna die.
[time=2357] If you question that at all, just look at some of the verbiage here.
[time=2361] Psalm 119, look at verse nine.
[time=2366] Verse nine, 10 and 11, how shall, how can a young man keep his way pure?
[time=2371] Many of you in the room know that young men today, older men today, young women, every single person that walks the face of his earth, trying to honor God.
[time=2381] You know how we struggle with purity.
[time=2384] You know the dangers that are inherent there.
[time=2386] You know the battles that are being fought.
[time=2388] You know the utter destruction that comes with impurity.
[time=2394] A lot on the line, how can a young man keep his way pure by keeping it according to your word?
[time=2400] With all my heart, David says, I have sought you.
[time=2402] David knew something about the calamity that came when one's heart got away from the word.
[time=2410] With all my heart, I have sought you.
[time=2412] Don't let me wander from your commandments.
[time=2415] Your word, I have treasured, I have hidden.
[time=2418] I have placed deep within my heart that I may not what, say it out loud.
[time=2424] Send against you.
[time=2425] Go to verse 110, Psalm 119 verse 110.
[time=2431] It says there, the wicked have laid a snare.
[time=2437] Don't miss this, my friends.
[time=2439] This is true, this is reality.
[time=2441] The wicked, the enemy himself and the wicked that follow him have laid a snare for me.
[time=2448] Yet I have not gone astray from your precepts.
[time=2453] Verse 116, sustain me according to your word that I may what, say it, live.
[time=2459] My friends, it is about life and death.
[time=2461] It really is that serious.
[time=2463] There really is that much at stake.
[time=2465] The snares and the traps really have been set.
[time=2469] And the Psalmist reminds us that there is one way through all of that and that is a heart and a mind that have stayed connected to him and his truth.
[time=2483] Sustain me according to your word, verse 116, that I may live and do not let me be ashamed of my hope, 117, uphold me that I may be what, say it, safe.
[time=2494] It really is on the line our safety and our life
[time=2500] and our futures uphold me that I may be safe, that I may have regard for your statutes, your scriptures continually.
[time=2513] 131, Psalm 119, verse 131, I opened my mouth, here's a picture, I opened my mouth wide and panted
[time=2525] for I longed for your what, say it, your commandments.
[time=2532] For I opened my mouth wide, how desperate is David for the word of God to be close?
[time=2542] He opens his mouth wide and pants.
[time=2546] You know, picture that, now you laugh at that, I know,
[time=2556] it looks kind of silly.
[time=2558] But I was thinking about it first hour, it felt kind of silly to do.
[time=2561] Maybe it shouldn't feel so silly, if that makes any sense.
[time=2570] Maybe that should be a posture.
[time=2572] You know, we talk about worship postures.
[time=2575] Maybe that should be a posture I should be more familiar with.
[time=2580] Maybe it feels so silly because I don't ever do it.
[time=2582] Maybe it seems kind of silly to you to have me stand here and stick my tongue out and pant like a dog.
[time=2589] 'Cause it's just not something we really ever picture or think about or imagine that we would be that desperate and that needy to strike a pose of utter desperation, panting for that and only that which can save.
[time=2607] Go to Psalm 5, the fifth Psalm.
[time=2615] Here again, I just want you to see the sense of desperation
[time=2624] that David had for God and for that time with him says in Psalm 5, verse one, "Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my groaning." This isn't just conversation.
[time=2639] No, this is the psalmist pouring out the deepest part of his life and his situation and his needs and his desires and his love and his adoration.
[time=2648] Consider my groaning, heed the sound of my cry for help, my king and my God, for to you I pray when, verse three, say it out loud.
[time=2658] In the morning, O Lord, you will hear my voice.
[time=2663] In the morning, I will order my prayer to you
[time=2671] and with great hope and with great faith.
[time=2674] I will eagerly watch.
[time=2677] Remember my friends, you don't make the effort to connect with God through the scriptures in times of prayer because it's your duty.
[time=2687] This isn't about duty.
[time=2688] This isn't about a list of things we just do because Christians do it.
[time=2693] No, no, no, this isn't about duty, you do it because you know the enemy has laid a snare.
[time=2698] Traps have been set throughout your day.
[time=2703] Traps to kill you, traps to maim you, traps to destroy you and the only way to avoid them is to walk through that field of traps with the Lord.
[time=2715] Raise your hand if you believe that.
[time=2717] Thank you.
[time=2720] Do you really believe that the enemy has laid a snare,
[time=2727] that traps have been set throughout your day that can kill maim and destroy you?
[time=2732] And if you do, the clear message of God's word is that you know, picture a minefield, picture a wood filled with traps, either way, the only way through that.
[time=2742] I know it sounds basic, but it's so true.
[time=2744] The only way through that's with him.
[time=2746] You're not gonna make that walk by yourself.
[time=2750] It's just not gonna happen.
[time=2754] Time with him, so very, very important.
[time=2759] Now for some of you in the room, you've got this figured out.
[time=2764] And if that's you, I am so grateful and I hope you just keep going down that road that you're on for many of you because I know you, because you email me and others on our team because I hear about the spiritual conversations you're having these days.
[time=2779] For many of you, you haven't got this first and foremost, this most important of all disciplines.
[time=2785] Many of you in the room don't have it figured out and I wanna try and just practically give you something to think about this morning.
[time=2793] Would you write this down?
[time=2795] I mean, would you give some thought to this?
[time=2796] I just took the time to just give you, I think some next steps on this.
[time=2802] And I wanna encourage you with this.
[time=2803] You may need it desperately.
[time=2805] You may know someone who's not here who needs it desperately.
[time=2808] Just write these things down and let's see if we can't just make some progress on this time with him.
[time=2814] Number one, get a Bible, all right?
[time=2817] In fact, go get a study Bible.
[time=2820] Just write that.
[time=2821] Go to any Christian bookstore that you live near.
[time=2825] Go in there, ask them to show you where their Bibles are and ask them to show you a really good study Bible.
[time=2831] Get a study Bible.
[time=2833] Secondly, then I want you to pick a book.
[time=2835] You've heard us talk in the past about reading through the Psalms or reading through the Proverbs.
[time=2840] It's a great idea.
[time=2842] You could pick any book, you know?
[time=2843] In the next month, we're gonna start a new series here studying kind of just section by section through the book of First John.
[time=2851] First John, a great book that gives insight into what it really looks like to be a Christ follower as we love God and try to love others.
[time=2859] You could pick First John, for instance.
[time=2861] Here's the deal, read about the specific book that you've picked.
[time=2865] Pick a book that you're gonna read through.
[time=2867] Read about the specific book you're going to read in your study Bible at the beginning of any book.
[time=2874] There will be a couple of pages of introduction.
[time=2877] That introduction will tell you about the book, who wrote it, who he was writing it to, why he was writing it, what the purpose of it is, things to look for, it's very, very helpful.
[time=2888] Go get a study Bible.
[time=2890] Pick a book to read through.
[time=2891] At the beginning of that book, there'll be an intro.
[time=2893] Read through that intro, read through it carefully.
[time=2896] Then every morning, get up.
[time=2898] Don't lay there, don't just roll out.
[time=2900] Go ahead and get up, wash your face, get some coffee.
[time=2903] Go to your secluded space.
[time=2906] Every morning, get up.
[time=2908] You're sitting there going every.
[time=2910] How about if we start with three?
[time=2913] Give it a shot.
[time=2914] Give it a try.
[time=2916] Every morning, get up and read a section of, or all, of a chapter in that book.
[time=2922] Now you might bump into a really long chapter, depending upon the book you pick.
[time=2927] You can do a section in my Bible.
[time=2929] There's chapters and then most of the chapters then are kind of broken down into sections.
[time=2933] Pick a section.
[time=2934] I'm not trying to keep you busy in the morning for three hours.
[time=2937] I'm trying to give you an opportunity to put your heart and your mind around a portion of God's word.
[time=2942] Every morning, get up and read a section of, or all, of a chapter in that book.
[time=2946] Now here you go.
[time=2947] As you read, write down in a notebook.
[time=2951] And then I kind of caught myself.
[time=2952] I realized, Kelly, you're 44 years old.
[time=2954] 40 and over still use notebooks.
[time=2957] Others of you can use your laptop, all right?
[time=2960] As you read, write down in a notebook or type into your laptop three things.
[time=2965] Here you go.
[time=2966] And I want this to be helpful and practical.
[time=2968] Write down three things as you read in that section of scripture.
[time=2972] Write down truth.
[time=2973] Write down some of the truth that you bump into, that you read that you're really, really thankful for.
[time=2979] As you read through your section and you see again what God did when you see what God has provided, when you see how God has transformed you, when you realize how he dealt with these people, anything that you find in there that really makes your heart thankful.
[time=2994] Write that down.
[time=2995] Secondly, as you read through your section, write down some questions, very important.
[time=3000] One of the ways in which God grew me the most and continues to grow me the most in my time with him.
[time=3006] I continue to read things in the scripture that do not make sense, that confuse me, that I need help thinking through what happens all the time.
[time=3016] Write down your questions.
[time=3019] Write them down or type them in.
[time=3020] Thirdly, record in your notebook or they're on your laptop truth, things that you read that brought conviction.
[time=3029] Anything that you read, that as you read it, you kind of went, "Ah, chh, yeah." I really need to work on that.
[time=3039] I'm not doing so well with that.
[time=3043] Write down things that bring conviction and then pray.
[time=3047] Write down truth that you're thankful for.
[time=3051] Write down questions.
[time=3052] Write down things that brought conviction.
[time=3054] Then spend some time sharing with him your response to what you read.
[time=3059] Pray through those questions with him.
[time=3061] That would be a great thing.
[time=3062] But then lastly, have someone in your life who can help you answer the questions.
[time=3068] This is huge, my friends.
[time=3071] We do not want you.
[time=3072] I don't want you trying to walk this road of relationship with him and a better understanding of this and allowing this to impact your heart and soul alone.
[time=3083] You can't, you need help.
[time=3085] So if you've got somebody in your life who you spiritually trust, take those questions there on your laptop or there in your journal and ask them.
[time=3095] Ask them to meet you once a week for coffee or for lunch or in the evening and just sit together and let them know what you read and share with them those questions.
[time=3106] If you don't have somebody, I mean this, who you could do that with, we'll find somebody for you.
[time=3113] I promise you, we can have someone for you.
[time=3117] It means that much to us.
[time=3119] At night then, before bed, read the same passage
[time=3125] and look over, now this is in the evening, this is at night sometime before your head hits the pillow, read the same passage and look over what you wrote that morning before praying again.
[time=3135] Go through that again with him.
[time=3138] Next point, repeat every day for the rest of your life.
[time=3142] How's that?
[time=3143] Repeat every day for the rest of your life.
[time=3147] Christian books, let me just say this.
[time=3152] Christian books, Christian authors, phenomenal.
[time=3157] Phenomenal gift, a phenomenal resource.
[time=3161] I hope you're picking them up and I hope you're reading from them.
[time=3164] Do not ever let those be a replacement for your time like we just laid it out or some other way.
[time=3171] Don't ever let those books become a replacement for this because this is what transforms you.
[time=3178] You wanna have music in your time of personal worship, do it.
[time=3184] You wanna have other books and supplements, great.
[time=3187] But you and I have got to have this.
[time=3189] Do not listen, do not allow there to be anything.
[time=3192] This is kind of challenging.
[time=3194] This was a little convicting for me as I wrote this.
[time=3196] Don't allow there to be anything that saturates your heart and mind more than this.
[time=3202] Think of all the things that get into your heart and mind.
[time=3209] Think of all the outlets around this culture and world of ours where we're taking in.
[time=3216] Don't let there be anything that saturates your mind and your heart more than this.
[time=3224] Why Hebrews 4, 12?
[time=3228] Would you stand?
[time=3229] Let me read this to you.
[time=3231] We gotta go.
[time=3231] Let me read this, why?
[time=3234] Somebody could listen to all of that.
[time=3236] Don't go anywhere.
[time=3237] Somebody could listen to all of that and say why.
[time=3242] Like why is, okay, I heard you, but why is it so important?
[time=3247] I mean, to listen to you, Kelly, it's like really, really important that I would stop at nothing.
[time=3253] To read and take in and study and ask questions about and be saturated by this because it says, here's why for the word of God is living.
[time=3264] This isn't a book.
[time=3267] It's like a living thing.
[time=3270] It's alive, he says.
[time=3273] For the word of God is living and active and it's sharper than any two-edged sword and it pierces as far as the division of soul and spirit of both joints and marrow and it the word of God is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[time=3294] David said thy word is a lamp unto my what?
[time=3299] My feet and a light unto my what?
[time=3301] Path, the scriptures, listen, listen, the scriptures have this uncanny capacity to reveal and expose and bring into light my ungodly motives, my ungodly thoughts, my ungodly decisions, my ungodly patterns.
[time=3320] You have any of those?
[time=3324] I do.
[time=3327] It's what the word of God does.
[time=3331] If there's deceit in my heart, God's word uncovers it.
[time=3335] If there's foolishness or selfishness in my plans or my direction, God's word brings it out in the open, if there's danger in my direction he can detour me when I meet with him and feed on his word and bask in his presence and listen to his voice and if you don't, one of those snares, one of those traps,
[time=3363] it will kill you and we don't want that.
[time=3367] You and I need a routine.
[time=3371] I said four things, we got to the first one and it was a good one and it was good that we spent that time, time with him.
[time=3377] There's also, and we'll come back to this, it's also so important my friends that we spend time with us.
[time=3384] This, this right here, this should not be compromised.
[time=3387] This should not be negotiable.
[time=3389] This should not ever be something, you know, that we should ever forfeit or let go of.
[time=3397] Time with him, time with us, we also need time with each other.
[time=3400] This is phenomenal and it is of God and God commands us to gather as a body.
[time=3406] He also commands us to be together with each other, smaller settings where life can be shared, truth can be embraced and life can get lived out in community and here's the deal.
[time=3420] This is where so many churches stop and this is where so many ministries die because they're all about time with him and they're all about time with us and they're all about time with each other and they never get to the point where they're then willing to spend time with them.
[time=3436] Them, this world that God called us to reach,
[time=3444] this neighbor, this coworker, this person, there's got to be a willingness to move toward them.
[time=3451] We'll come back to that.
[time=3452] I just hope and pray, you'll give yourself this week to some routine, if you need some help, let us know.
[time=3458] God, thank you for your word and thank you that you can with a willing heart and an open Bible, cup of coffee in a secluded place.
[time=3470] God, you can do transforming stuff and I pray each and every one of us would take it that seriously and give ourselves to that.
[time=3478] Thank you for the encouragement that your scripture brings again this morning in your son's name we pray.
[time=3484] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3516] (upbeat music)
