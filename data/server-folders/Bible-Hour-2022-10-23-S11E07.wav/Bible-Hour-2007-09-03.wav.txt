[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age.
[time=49] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=74] "Thank you for love, thank you for learning, thank you for loving me."
[time=92] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I am so grateful
[time=98] that you've joined us again on the broadcast, and I want to just tell you before you see the message today, I want to say this to you, I think it's a message that you should hear,
[time=108] I think it's a message that I should hear, I think today's message, which is a continuation of just a couple of weeks ago, is a message that all of us should take to heart, whether
[time=119] you're a part of the Black Hawk family or whether you're a part of another local church family, or maybe you're out there on your own, I think these are some truths that you need to, and I need to hold tightly to take hold of and really, really consider.
[time=135] What we're going to talk about basically is what your week and mine should look like,
[time=141] a week in the life of a follower of Christ.
[time=145] And we started this two weeks ago, and there's just four basic things, and I want to just say them to you quickly, and then I want you to be able to watch and take in whatever God might have for you, there has got to be in your life and mine consecrated and committed
[time=159] and regular time with him.
[time=162] That time with him should move us toward time with us, and when we say time with us, that's
[time=169] the body.
[time=170] There has got to be a commitment in your heart and mind to not go without meeting with the
[time=176] body of Christ.
[time=177] We have got together, we have got to come together and unite.
[time=182] There has got to be times where we are in the same room together as a church, and that's so very important.
[time=189] Time with him, time with us, time with each other.
[time=191] We're going to talk about that this morning, how important it is that you and I would in our life have smaller communities of folks, people, believers who would encourage us and love us and speak the truth to us and pray with us and celebrate and cry and do all the things that we need to do together according to the Scripture, the one in others are an
[time=212] amazing list of things that God gave us for a reason.
[time=216] There is life to be found when we live and share life together.
[time=221] Time with him, time with us, time with each other and all of it, here's the thing, all of that should lead us individually and all of it should lead us as a church to time with
[time=232] them.
[time=233] That's right.
[time=235] Those still on the outside looking in, those still asking questions, those still far from
[time=241] God, those still existing on a day-to-day basis without the peace and forgiveness and
[time=249] meaning that only Christ can bring.
[time=251] All of our meeting with God and all of our meeting with each other and all of our meeting as a church, if all that ever does is just lead us to those three things, we've missed something significant.
[time=262] I believe the Scripture is so very clear that it should all lead us to them, a pursuit, a loving, kind, and gracious pursuit of them.
[time=270] I hope you open your heart in your mind today.
[time=273] I hope the Lord will speak to you.
[time=275] I know He has to me on these things and I can't wait for you to take it in.
[time=279] Thank you so much for being here.
[time=281] God bless you.
[time=282] Have a great week and we hope to see you soon.
[time=292] [MUSIC]
[time=294] Praise to the Lord in your mind and your creation, oh, I so praise Him for His I hope and salvation.
[time=309] Oh, you hear now to His temple drawing me.
[time=326] Praise to the Lord, the Lord of things so His workless be rained.
[time=342] Be unto His wings, yes of truth, be subscated, last of the sea, now all thy longings are there.
[time=362] [MUSIC - 8 seconds]
[time=396] Praise to the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
[time=421] praise the Lord.
[time=429] [MUSIC]
[time=457] Praise to the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=485] Praise to the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=507] Praise to the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=535] Kelly and Steve are going to come and open the word for us and I'd love for us to just absorb the truth in James chapter 2 before that happens.
[time=547] Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves.
[time=553] Do what it says.
[time=555] Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in the mirror and after looking at himself goes away
[time=564] and immediately forgets what he looks like.
[time=568] But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues to do so, not forgetting what he has heard but doing it, he will be blessed in what he does.
[time=590] Oh, amen, and it is Steve's and I's hope together that you would do that today, that you would open up your heart and your mind to what God's word has to say.
[time=603] We prayed together this morning and I was so thankful.
[time=606] Steve as he often does just prayed that you would not hear our voices but that you would hear his, that you would hear the truth and that it would encourage you, that it would convict you, that it would
[time=619] point you in a new direction, that it would give you hope and our hope today is that our time together would do that very thing for you.
[time=627] We are going to today and this is Steve long break for those of you that may not know Steve.
[time=632] Many of you in the room do.
[time=633] Steve has been a part of the Blackhawk family for 29 years and so many I almost want to say 30 but we'll just say 29.
[time=642] Came here to work with our school back in 1979 and has been a part of this team, has been a part of this family ever since.
[time=654] A year ago he left our staff and went into another opportunity which is a kingdom opportunity with a great great organization that he's now working with here locally and is also now an elder on our board
[time=670] which is a great thing to have him back in there.
[time=672] Really enjoying the opportunity to tell Kelly what to do once in a while.
[time=677] I mean I don't get that alone but together the elders can do that.
[time=681] Right, right, it's good, it's good having him in the mix.
[time=684] I don't mind having Steve tell me what to do and he is not only an elder and not only been around here for a long, long time.
[time=693] He, you know, what we talk about today and we'll get to that in just a moment.
[time=698] I'm just so thankful he's here today because he has so much to add to this discussion and I'm thankful that it worked out that he could be with us today.
[time=707] Today we talk about what we started a couple weeks ago.
[time=709] We took a break on Labor Day and it was a great service with the kids.
[time=714] I'm so thankful so many of you came.
[time=716] But if you remember a couple weeks before we began to talk about what you're weak, a week in the life of a Christ follower.
[time=722] We began to talk about the kind of the non-negotiable disciplines.
[time=727] The things that really when you get right down to it and you begin to think about what needs to be there in your daily, every day, week by week life.
[time=736] The stuff that's got to be there for you and I to follow him well.
[time=740] For you and I to be all that he has called us to be.
[time=743] There are some things that need to be there and we kind of laid those out two weeks ago.
[time=748] We only got to the first one and we'll review that quickly this morning and then get to the next three.
[time=754] But I want to just remind you today where that started two weeks ago.
[time=758] Where it began and Steve would tell you and I would tell you in most of you in the room who have been walking with the Lord for years would tell everybody that this first one really is the most important one.
[time=770] And we talked about it two weeks ago. Time with him.
[time=776] We talked about how this really all begins with a commitment on your part and a readiness on mind to be a people who individually are going to stop at nothing to have time with him specifically to have time with him in his word.
[time=793] To make sure that morning, noon or night or morning, noon and night to make sure that we're living lives and structuring our days and nights in such a way that we are slowing down, getting quiet.
[time=806] We talked about two weeks ago the pattern of Jesus, how he got up in the early morning and walked away from the house to a place of seclusion where he could worship with the Father, have his heart and his soul restored and renewed.
[time=820] We talked about how very, very important it would be for you and I to be a people who would stop at nothing.
[time=826] We talked about how the enemy, we talked about how the enemy every single day, the enemy because the enemy knows you.
[time=833] The enemy knows your life. The enemy knows how you're wired. The enemy knows how our days work and he looks at your day and he looks at mine and he strategically will just place things right along the path of your day.
[time=846] He will strategically bring things and put them in your path hoping that you will step on a mind and blow yourself up.
[time=856] He'll bring temptation and he'll bring discouragement and he'll bring opportunity. He wants nothing more than to dissuade you and discourage you from this path that you're on in your effort to follow Christ.
[time=867] And we talked about how when you and I are willing to be a people who faithfully and passionately meet with him to take in what's true, to pray with him, to speak with him, to listen to him, to sing to him, to fill our minds and our souls with that which can give direction and meaning and purpose.
[time=889] That's a way you and I can walk that road that day, stay away from those traps and follow him in a way that brings honor and glory to him.
[time=901] I had him, we put up some things here on stage just to remind us today and if we went back to that first, if we went back to that first point a couple weeks ago time with him, I wanted just, here's a life application study Bible.
[time=915] I was so encouraged. I had several people stop me that morning and then others even email me that week and let me know they had gone to the bookstore and they had picked up the application study Bible like we had suggested.
[time=930] Remember, I encourage you to go get one and pick a book and read about that book in the introduction section and then pick a chapter or just a first, you know, a few paragraphs and begin to read it and read it over and over again and pray through it and write down questions and we had people actually call in.
[time=949] Because I said to you, if you need someone to ask your questions to, if you need someone to talk to about your new journey into studying God's Word and people called and we got them connected.
[time=961] It was really encouraging. Here's the alarm clock. Just a reminder.
[time=965] Got to set it. Got to set it. Coffee may help, it may not, but you've been doing that for a long time, haven't you?
[time=973] Yeah, you know, it wasn't really natural for me to think about him in the morning and for years I kind of fought that because the people that talked about being with the Lord alone in the morning kind of emphasized the fact that it had to be then and they'd always say, you know, it'd be okay at noon
[time=994] or night or whatever, but one of the things I've been learning the last few years is I've been trying my best to, before I get out of bed, say good morning to the Lord.
[time=1007] And it doesn't need to be a real long prayer.
[time=1010] But when I say good morning to him then and I really become conscious of the reality that he's present, it changes my day.
[time=1022] And if I get out of my routine and I don't do that, it feels so weird if at 8.30 or something I first think about him and I say good morning to him then and I'm off and I'm in the car and I'll go, good morning Lord and then I'll go, good grief, I'm really sorry.
[time=1036] I didn't say good morning earlier. I know you're here. I know you've been here all along, but there's something about awareness.
[time=1044] Yeah, yeah. Well, I hope you'll, I hope if you were there two weeks ago, I hope you've been giving yourself to that.
[time=1051] If you're kind of hearing this for the first time, just please know, it is a non-negotiable.
[time=1056] It is something you and I cannot live. We cannot function. We cannot survive without it.
[time=1061] There has got to be rich, meaningful personal time with him.
[time=1066] And if you need any help with that, again, let me just say it to you, ask, and we'll do everything we can to come alongside you and encourage you.
[time=1073] So that that can be a reality. Time with him. All four points here in our talk this morning, time with somebody, that first one, time with him.
[time=1083] Secondly, let's keep going now and let me talk to you about a second, I think, non-negotiable discipline that's got to be, it has to be present in my life and yours.
[time=1094] And that would be a commitment to time with us. Time with us. And by us, I mean you and I, this family, gathered the body of Christ, this local expression of the body of Christ gathered here in this place on a Sunday morning at 9 or 1045.
[time=1115] Open your Bibles if you would to Hebrews. Hebrews chapter 10, let me just read this for you. Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and 25.
[time=1123] I want to read this to you and then Steve's going to give you what he entitled some blessings, some blessings that come when you and I are faithful and consistent in our gathering together.
[time=1136] I don't know, I don't know what it is that would lead you to not be here. I mean I kind of do because I know there are things that come up. I know you get sick.
[time=1147] I know people die. I know there are weddings out of town. I understand for the most part, some of what may take us away from a commitment to be together, but I really want you to think about this now.
[time=1159] I want you to think about the reality of your life and your own commitment to gathering and what that looks like, really, honestly.
[time=1167] Let me show you what it says here in Hebrews 10 and then I want Steve to talk to you about the blessings that come when we are a people who are willing to gather.
[time=1175] It says in Hebrews 10, 24 and let us consider here writing to those believers in that region, the writer of Hebrews says let us consider how to stimulate some translations may read spur, spur on.
[time=1192] Some translations may read encourage says here in the NAS, let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds.
[time=1202] Well, how can we do that? Well, look what it says by not forsaking, not forsaking our own assembling together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another in that assembly.
[time=1216] And all the more as you see the day drawing near, let us consider how to stimulate each other to love and good deeds, not forsaking, not passing on, not making optional, the gathering together of the body.
[time=1234] Steve, talk about that a little bit. Is the day nearer than it was when the author of Hebrews wrote that book? Yeah, if he's talking to the people that are going to read that and telling them as the day draws near the day of the Lord he's talking about.
[time=1250] And we need to encourage one another. When I wrote down the blessings of the gathering, I just drew up on my own experiences here. This is no exegesis from the Scripture.
[time=1261] This is just what I can look back on and see that I've really gleaned from being a participant in this body here on state and lame-wire for all these years. And the first one was encouragement.
[time=1275] It's not encouraging throughout your day to face the realities of the fallen nature of people.
[time=1284] Now, there can be some moments of encouragement during the week, but when we come here and we're focused together on worshiping him, and that's really what we're thinking about when we're all here together, and we're looking forward to seeing our brothers and our sisters that we haven't seen all week.
[time=1303] My brothers and my sisters, he's adopted us into a family, and when I get to see you, there were three or four people last service that I hadn't seen for a while, and immediately I felt better, because it's an encouragement.
[time=1318] He wants us to encourage one another, and in this setting, I have found more encouragement than other settings because people usually have problems in other settings, but typically we come together here to worship, and that's really, really encouraging.
[time=1333] So even if we come with problems, we come together with problems to a place where there's hope, and it's encouraging then to bear one another's burdens. It's an encouragement to be together. We're like-minded.
[time=1345] That's what it is. Secondly, I wrote down, I've really loved learning the word collectively.
[time=1355] I've loved the synthesis that takes place when I get people's opinions about what they heard from the sermon.
[time=1362] We often, one of the A-B-F's that I taught, we would simply review the previous week's sermon every Sunday morning, and so that week, I'd just kind of meditate and chew on whatever.
[time=1375] I'm not doing anything, so.
[time=1378] But it is me. I think it just is a bad connection. Let me play with your belt, Hill.
[time=1396] There we go. I'll try to keep from breathing.
[time=1405] I used to breathe, and that part didn't move all that much.
[time=1409] It's okay. It's good. It wasn't plugged in all the way.
[time=1413] Thank you. You're welcome.
[time=1416] Secondly, learning the word together, the synthesis that takes place, the application that we get to make together when we hear the word and study the word.
[time=1425] I think I've learned more meditating on sermons that I've heard at church than any other way.
[time=1432] Now, I've studied the Bible a lot, but that's been really good for me, and so I'm thankful for that.
[time=1437] Thirdly, I wrote down worship through singing.
[time=1440] Whether I'm singing or listening to singing, it doesn't matter.
[time=1444] What that choir number did to me this morning, I want what happened to me sitting down in that pew when they were singing about praising my Lord.
[time=1456] I want to get to experience that. That was powerful, and when we sing together, it's powerful.
[time=1464] I love what music does. I love to worship Him through prayer together.
[time=1470] I really like it when we collectively pray.
[time=1473] When we're thinking in one way, when we're united in our thoughts, we're praying for somebody or for a change that we need to take place or just to focus our attention on Him.
[time=1484] I love that.
[time=1485] Fourthly, can I jump in real quick?
[time=1486] Yeah.
[time=1487] On the singing, Steve just said there's great power and encouragement when we sing together.
[time=1492] When I sense and use sense that we are collectively lifting our voices to Him in light of who you are, who I am, where we've been in experience.
[time=1503] Now we're in this room, and now we get a chance to sing.
[time=1505] He said it was so encouraging to know that we're doing that together.
[time=1509] I'll just say this to you, and this is not a slap on the wrist.
[time=1513] I just want to say this to you, it's a plan of thought in your mind.
[time=1517] You may struggle with it. It may just be an issue for some reason or another, but I want to tell you, it's discouraging when you don't.
[time=1528] When I'm singing my guts out down here, and you've got your arms folded across your chest, and you're not, there could be a thousand reasons why.
[time=1538] A thousand reasons why, believe me, I understand that.
[time=1541] And there may even be some legitimacy to that.
[time=1543] You may need to, on a certain Sunday, not saying hear me.
[time=1547] I understand that.
[time=1548] I'm talking about, in general, I would hope that you would be willing to come into this place, and no matter who you are, where you've been, what's transpired, that we could together authentically lift our voices to Him.
[time=1562] If you sound good, if you sound bad, it doesn't matter because it's all about a joyful what?
[time=1568] Noise.
[time=1570] So I hope you'll sing, and I hope you'll lift your voice unashamedly and unabashedly.
[time=1576] Me too.
[time=1578] So fourth was prayer, and the fifth one that I wrote down was probably the most significant one to me, and that was that I get energized.
[time=1587] I get energized when I'm with like-minded people.
[time=1590] I must have told them worship through giving was the fifth one I wanted to put down there.
[time=1594] That's a good one.
[time=1595] That's a really good one.
[time=1596] That's a good one.
[time=1597] I had several.
[time=1598] But I like the one you were about to say.
[time=1600] Yeah, let me just tell you.
[time=1601] When I'm with you, when I'm with you, and I get equipped by the word, and I get to spend time with you, I get re-energized because my week is draining.
[time=1616] And this is one of the times when we're together, it's just positive input, and I just get really, really energized by the encouragement that I receive from you.
[time=1629] And hopefully I'm spending all that.
[time=1632] We'll get to that point later.
[time=1634] Hopefully I'm spending all that, so I need to be here with you.
[time=1638] I remember meeting with one of our friends that was going to leave our church for a reason, and I said, I just said, you know what?
[time=1645] It just breaks my heart that you're going to leave me because you don't like that.
[time=1651] It just, it broke my heart.
[time=1655] I said, I don't get to see you every week because you don't like that.
[time=1660] And it was, you know what part of our week it was?
[time=1663] You know what percentage of what we were doing?
[time=1665] It's this.
[time=1666] Typically is.
[time=1667] What's this?
[time=1669] The reasons we leave?
[time=1671] Oh, got you.
[time=1672] Yeah.
[time=1672] Yeah, I'm not very clear then.
[time=1674] Those are the reasons we leave.
[time=1677] And I just, it broke my heart.
[time=1679] And it's happened a lot.
[time=1681] In the 28 years I've been here.
[time=1684] A lot of my friends left me because they didn't like that.
[time=1687] And man, that is heartbreaking.
[time=1690] I told Steve the way I view it sometimes, and I try not to, I try not to, you know, say this too much, or I don't, sometimes maybe I'm hesitant to communicate this.
[time=1700] Part of me doesn't want to, and maybe I shouldn't be.
[time=1703] Maybe I should just be more forthright.
[time=1705] And I'm going to say it right now, so I'll be forthright here.
[time=1708] There's times I feel like when you are not here, I feel deprived.
[time=1713] And that might sound kind of selfish, but I view us as being a part of something that is significant.
[time=1720] I view us as being partners in the greatest endeavor of all.
[time=1725] I view us as being together in this thing.
[time=1728] And this thing is, boy, I tell you, between Monday and Saturday, it can be, as Steve said, it can be draining.
[time=1735] It can be discouraging.
[time=1736] It can be intense.
[time=1737] It can be worrisome.
[time=1739] And I tell you, I look forward to seeing you.
[time=1743] I look forward to seeing your face.
[time=1746] And some faces I know better than others, but it doesn't matter.
[time=1749] I like seeing the faces I sort of know.
[time=1752] It is encouraging to me.
[time=1755] We were talking upstairs earlier this morning about war and POWs.
[time=1763] Watch this.
[time=1765] It was amazing to think about how you pick your war.
[time=1769] You know, I kind of grew up when I was growing up and hearing about POWs, it was Vietnam.
[time=1774] And I would hear stories and I would read books about how when the POWs would be taken to these camps.
[time=1782] The one thing that the enemy wanted to do was they wanted to squelch the spirit of those men.
[time=1788] They wanted those men hopeless.
[time=1790] They wanted those men discouraged.
[time=1792] They wanted those men just beaten down, tortured, and left without any sense of anything being okay or anything being hope.
[time=1802] They just wanted to absolutely annihilate their spirit.
[time=1805] So what would they do?
[time=1806] Would they leave them in big groups or would they separate them?
[time=1810] Answer, separate them.
[time=1813] They wanted those men in isolation because they knew if they could get them in isolation, all of a sudden the cause goes away.
[time=1820] You get them in isolation, all of a sudden they get discouraged.
[time=1825] And we were just amazed because we were talking about how we would hear stories.
[time=1828] And you've heard the stories about how those men, oftentimes, they would figure out ways, even though isolated.
[time=1836] They would figure out ways to communicate.
[time=1839] Remember, they would do Morris code on bamboo shoots that traveled through water.
[time=1845] I mean, they would do all kinds of things to just simply get the message to the other side of the camp that I'm still here.
[time=1852] I'm not dead.
[time=1854] I'm not broken.
[time=1855] I'm still hopeful.
[time=1858] And that may seem to you overstated if it does.
[time=1861] I'm sorry, but that is exactly how it feels to me.
[time=1865] When I get to see you on a regular basis in this place, there is great encouragement and great joy that comes knowing that you're still at it.
[time=1876] And when I don't see you, then sometimes it's hard to know.
[time=1880] And I miss that.
[time=1881] I miss you.
[time=1882] And I think there's great strength in being together.
[time=1885] Now, we want to show you something here, I think, important.
[time=1888] Here's some props for the time with him.
[time=1891] On the time with us, we've got a Bible, and here's a bulletin and a CD case, all of that good stuff.
[time=1898] We wanted to show you this this morning, because I think this is really, I think this is appropriate.
[time=1903] I don't want this to sound self-serving.
[time=1906] I don't want it to sound heavy-handed or authoritative, you know me.
[time=1910] I'm not, you know us, we're not like that.
[time=1912] But there is something about, I'll let you explain it.
[time=1916] Go ahead.
[time=1917] That umbrella represents the reality that the body of Christ is supposed to be protected by the elders of the church.
[time=1928] There's a reality that God says that elders are the shepherds and overseers of men's souls.
[time=1936] He also says elders, don't forget those of you that are out there, I'm remembering this.
[time=1940] Don't forget who the shepherd and overseer of your soul is that you're accountable to for shepherding and overseeing the souls of the men and the women in the church.
[time=1948] There's an element of protection that God intends for the collective elders to give to the body of Christ.
[time=1957] And we need to make sure that we're participating in that.
[time=1960] One of the ways that shepherding, one of the ways that care comes is when a teaching elder on a regular basis
[time=1969] provides that family with truth to know, understand, and live by.
[time=1975] So again, not to sound self-serving, but whether it's me or whether it's Mitch or whether it's Steve or somebody else from our team,
[time=1981] you being here allows you the opportunity to come under and see we're in a culture today
[time=1989] that's kind of moving quickly the other direction because you can listen to it on the internet, because you can download it onto your iPod and because you can get resources and messages and you can get spiritually encouraged in a thousand different places.
[time=2004] And while I'm thankful, and many of you are thankful for all the above, there is no substitute for the body gathered. Hebrews 10, don't forsake it,
[time=2014] and he wants all of us to come under the teaching, the collective, authoritative, loving teaching
[time=2022] of those elders in that place, and this room at 9 and 1045 for us is the place and the opportunity that you and I get to do that.
[time=2031] Now, I want to just say this too, and I want to stay loving in my tone because I really do feel that way,
[time=2039] but sometimes I'll bump into a little bit of what I just referred to.
[time=2044] I'll bump into it, and it's not just younger.
[time=2048] There is a generation today, statistically, you can read about this.
[time=2054] George Barna wrote a book two years ago called The Revolution, and there is, statistically,
[time=2060] a reality today that 20-somethings in our culture are leaving the church in mass.
[time=2068] They are. They say it doesn't meet their need.
[time=2072] They say that its form doesn't meet their preference.
[time=2076] They say that there are just too many things about the institutionalized church that for them,
[time=2083] they just don't connect with, so they're leaving, and they're having church in coffee shops,
[time=2089] and they're having church in living rooms, and they're meeting with like-minded friends, and there isn't anything wrong with small groups.
[time=2098] In fact, we're going to talk about it in just a moment.
[time=2101] But what I'll hear and what's evil here and what others of you have heard again and again in recent days is you know what? I appreciate what you try and do on Sundays.
[time=2110] I have a great small group, and in my small group, we study God's Word, and we pray for each other,
[time=2117] and we encourage each other, and we even serve as a small group.
[time=2120] So really, in my small group, I get everything I need, and I really don't need what goes on on a Sunday morning.
[time=2129] And I want to just, and whether that's a 20-year-old or a 50-year-old, I want to just remind you, and I want to just say to you what I would say to someone who is articulating that.
[time=2140] I would just, I would try to get them to see that in their explanation they just gave me, I counted about 13 eyes.
[time=2149] I like this, and I find that, and I want a kind of experience, and in my small group,
[time=2159] and I really appreciate it, and I want to just remind you that it's not about you,
[time=2166] that this is about us, and we get deprived when you are not here.
[time=2175] And it may not all be exactly like you'd like it to be, and you may have questions about how certain things or why certain things are done, but please understand that while we are thankful for smaller communities, there isn't any substitute for the encouragement and strength, the love and good deeds that we get spurred on to
[time=2193] when you and I are in this place together.
[time=2196] Does that make sense? Do you want to add anything to that?
[time=2199] The only thing I'd say is that the body of Christ is made up of many parts.
[time=2206] Some are eyes, and some are feet, and some are arms.
[time=2209] Many parts, and so we need all of you, all the parts.
[time=2217] That's good.
[time=2218] Time with Him, time with us, time with each other.
[time=2222] Let's talk about smaller communities that would meet.
[time=2226] Let's talk about the great value and the great benefit of you and I being in settings that are more personable,
[time=2234] that are more intimate, that provide deeper levels of relationship and accountability and encouragement
[time=2241] than we might be able to experience in a setting like this.
[time=2245] Time with each other. Steve's got a great, great passage in Ephesians.
[time=2249] Why don't you turn there? It's Ephesians 4, right?
[time=2251] Yeah, Ephesians 4, 1 through 6.
[time=2254] Let's take some time to read that as we think about what He's called us to do with each other.
[time=2262] It says, "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord," Paul writing to Ephesians,
[time=2268] "implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called
[time=2275] with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,
[time=2284] being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling.
[time=2297] One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all
[time=2304] and through all and in all.
[time=2307] We have opportunities to love one another and we need to know each other in order to do that.
[time=2316] One of the things I've loved over the years is I've been in small groups most of my adult life
[time=2324] and I've had people that knew me well enough to do the one and others that we're going to talk about in a few minutes.
[time=2331] They had, in order to know me well enough, I had to be in an intimate relationship with them where I was transparent and vulnerable and believe me, they were forced to be gentle and humble and loving toward me because I needed it.
[time=2349] God really used people over and over and over again to love me.
[time=2358] When it says, "Tolerant," did you see that word?
[time=2363] I said they had to be humble and gentle and patient.
[time=2366] Yeah, they had the tolerance showing tolerance there at the end of chapter 2.
[time=2372] I mean, verse 2, "They had to be tolerant of me a lot.
[time=2379] And I'm so glad that they've stuck with me when I needed to be tolerated and confronted.
[time=2387] I'm really grateful for that." Let me just have them put on the screen.
[time=2392] This is not a complete list.
[time=2395] It's generally a pretty decent-sized list of all the one and others that we find in Scripture.
[time=2401] My friends, God's Word is really clear that we are to live with a level of intimacy and in a kind of relationship.
[time=2410] I mean, these commands, these truths on the screen give evidence to the fact that it is God's design that you and I would live this close to each other.
[time=2423] And as you look at this, here's what I want you to think.
[time=2425] I want you to think about the everyday of your life, whether you're a high school student, a young married couple, an older adult, doesn't matter.
[time=2432] I want you to think about the everyday of your life, and Scripture is saying that what should be normative for the everyday of your life should be a presence of Biblical community in which you and I are experiencing on a regular basis these things.
[time=2451] This is not extreme. This is normative or should be for you and I. We are to be devoted to one another.
[time=2462] We are to accept one another. We are to bear with each other.
[time=2468] We are to pray for one another. We are to build up one another, encourage each other, forgive each other, spur each other on to love and good deeds.
[time=2479] Stop right there. Don't go to the next slide. Just look at that for a moment.
[time=2483] Deep devotion to others in a very, very personal way across the board acceptance of each other.
[time=2493] Strengths, weaknesses, downsides, upsides, bearing with, there's the tolerance, being patient with.
[time=2500] Anybody who knows me knows I have enormous downsides.
[time=2505] I'm so thankful for my wife. I'm so thankful for my kids. I'm so grateful for my good friends because they know my downsides.
[time=2512] They know how challenging it can be. They know how discouraging it can be at times to live and try and relate to me, and they bear with me.
[time=2521] That's not bearing with his sinfulness. No, that's not his sinful behavior. That means I'm going to bear up under his personality quirks.
[time=2530] Yeah, exactly. I'm going to confront him about his sinful behavior, but tolerate and even learn to enjoy some of his personality quirks.
[time=2540] Go to the next slide.
[time=2542] Love one another. Don't go past that one too quick.
[time=2551] There should be an intimate group of people in your life where you really share your, communicate your, proclaim your evidence, your love for them.
[time=2564] You're a gape. Not your filetto, like, brotherly, I think you're nice. No, I mean you're a gape.
[time=2572] You're, I'll do anything for you. I'll make sacrifices for you. I'll go the extra mile for you because I love you.
[time=2582] There should be love going back and forth at a very significant level.
[time=2587] There should be in your life, sir. We should be serving. There should be a community of people in your life where needs are being met.
[time=2594] Physical needs, emotional needs, spiritually where I'm willing to do anything I have to do to serve you.
[time=2604] There should be serving going on and loving going back and forth. We should be comforting each other.
[time=2610] We should be hospitable, opening our homes, sharing our resources, doing whatever we've got to do to meet a need.
[time=2617] Speaking truth, this is so big. This is so important. You know what? There are so many of you in this room that don't have this.
[time=2627] There are so many in this room, I fear, that don't live in relationship with others at a level where someone would come into your office like someone did with me this week.
[time=2640] A friend of mine, who I work with, who I respect immensely, we have had years together.
[time=2649] And every once in a while, I just get difficult to be around my downsides and he had bared with me for a while and having bared with me for a while,
[time=2659] now he needed to come and close the door and sit me down and say, "Hey, I've got to speak some truth to you about the way you're doing some things."
[time=2667] And he was right. And you need that. I've got to have that.
[time=2676] People willing, close enough, trust established, the right to speak there, who will tell you the truth about how you're coming across or decisions you're making or attitudes you seem to be harboring, speaking the truth to one another.
[time=2694] Confessing, wow, look at that one. There should be a level of relationship in your life where you're with a community of people who meet on a regular basis and as part of that environment, we should be confessing our sins to each other.
[time=2713] They should mean that much to you. The relationship could be and it can be that rich where you could say to them, "I need to confess. I've confessed to God and sought his forgiveness, but we're friends, and we're in this together, and I want to just say this. I did this. I thought this. I planned that."
[time=2739] There should be a level of relationship that you and I have with others where we can admonish. What is it, Steve?
[time=2746] I really don't understand that word. That really goes hand in hand with speak truth to one another. If I'm going to admonish you, I'm going to get you to do what you should be doing.
[time=2758] You know what those are? Those are all acts of love. Love's always a choice. It's not a romantic feeling. Love's always a choice. Those are all acts of love.
[time=2772] And what I noticed about that list is they're not really complicated. They're each simple. They're just all hard. They're all really hard to do.
[time=2786] It's hard for me to love you the way you should be loved. And it's hard for me to love my wife and say, "Yes when I should say yes for her sake."
[time=2797] And know when I should say no for her sake. It's hard, but it is honoring to God, and it is the way we experience real community.
[time=2809] Now watch this. Now look at that last one. Bear one another's burdens. I don't want to miss that.
[time=2816] I can look around this room this morning and just because of the years that God's given us, I can just name 30 people right now.
[time=2827] I can just look at you. I can just name 30 people right now, and I know that your burdens have been shared.
[time=2836] Your burden has been carried. The disease that you've fought, the money you didn't have, the struggle with the kids that you encountered.
[time=2847] Whatever it might have been, I know that there are stories in this room where community, good friends that have been meeting together on a regular basis have come alongside you and it has meant the world to you.
[time=2859] Here's what I want to say about this whole list. If you go back to the first slide and you look back through this second slide, all of these one another's.
[time=2868] Now I just said, Stephen I just said, all that we did about the gathering and how important it is that we be in this room together, right?
[time=2877] But I just want to make sure we're clear on this. In which setting can all of that and all of that supposed to be non-negotiable?
[time=2886] In which setting can all of that happen most effectively in the Pew, 1045 on a Sunday, or in a living room?
[time=2898] With 8, 9, 10, 12 believers living and sharing life together. Pew living room, answer, living room.
[time=2907] We can touch on some of these things in the gathering, but my friends, you have got to be in a living room.
[time=2917] There has got to be community in your life and I'm here to just say it to you again if you need help or encouragement moving in that direction.
[time=2926] Here's the deal. If all of these things that Stephen I just talked you through, if all of this isn't happening in your life,
[time=2935] then you are getting your clock cleaned.
[time=2939] Then you are not anywhere near experiencing what God designed you and I to experience in the body of Christ.
[time=2948] These things have got to be happening.
[time=2951] Don't forget the crock pot because that's a great part.
[time=2954] Prop. My favorite prop up here this morning is there's nothing like sharing life together. There's also nothing like sharing a meal together.
[time=2962] There's a crock pot right there and a boom box.
[time=2966] The boom box has just, you know, it's been fun for many groups in our setting here at Blackhawk.
[time=2972] Corbin, actually Josh and Corbin worked together. Josh got Corbin to record a CD and again it might sound corny to some of you.
[time=2981] Others of you have been really, really grateful for it. There are some groups who have, you know, musicians in them so you get your own deal right there live.
[time=2989] But many groups, you know, love to worship.
[time=2992] So Corbin recorded a CD of many of the songs that he's written and that we do on a Sunday morning.
[time=2999] And so those are available for your small group. If you want to worship together, that's why we got that up there.
[time=3003] But the crock pot, life together, a meal together, nothing like it.
[time=3008] I want to tell you about the last thing here though.
[time=3011] And we're going to wrap it up with this.
[time=3013] If, my friends, if all your time with him and if all your time with us and if all your time with each other ends there, then I think you've completely missed it.
[time=3032] And as nice as that might be and as enjoyable as that might be and as meaningful as it might be to send time with him and time with us and time with each other, we believe that the Scriptures teach that all of that should lead to time with them.
[time=3049] That's right, them.
[time=3051] Those on the outside still looking in, those across the cubicle from you at work, those across the street from you in the neighborhood, those on the sidelines that you sit with on a Saturday morning, those across town, those in Biloxi, those in Nairobi.
[time=3074] You see, if all of what we've talked about this morning doesn't lead you and I to be a people who are willing to go, who are willing to take all that we've been given and all that's been built into us and all that he has brought in our time with him, time with us and time with each other.
[time=3091] If we're not willing to take that and give that away, what are we doing?
[time=3097] And I just, we just put some things up there. There's a, there's a soccer ball because you know there may be chances for you to go and meet a need with those that you recreate with or those that your kids recreate with.
[time=3110] There may be, there's a kid's toy up there.
[time=3113] You know what young people? You might could, you might could go and you might could meet a need. You could take your time with him and your time with us and your time with each other and young people or, or you know, single guy or gal, you could go and babysit.
[time=3128] You could go, you know, for free. You could find a family on your block or somebody that your parents know and you could minister to them.
[time=3136] You could get beyond yourself and we could get outside our four walls and you could go and minister to someone while you watch their kids.
[time=3143] There's a, some hedge clippers right there. You know what we've talked about that a couple weeks ago.
[time=3147] There's some yards that could use some work. There's a few bushes that could be trimmed.
[time=3153] And I put a planner. There's a little, there's a planner right here.
[time=3157] Here's why I put the planner and I want to say this to dads and I want to say this to moms.
[time=3162] Some of you moms and dads are, you're at this, you know, together.
[time=3167] Some of you moms are on your own at this. Some of you dads are on your own.
[time=3172] Here's why I put the planner on this last one, time with them, taking all that we've been giving and then giving it away, passing on God to others.
[time=3182] I have found that rarely do any of those things I just mentioned or the ten ideas you could come up with just like that rarely do they happen unless there's some intentionality behind them.
[time=3196] Unless you sit down with your crew on a Sunday night and say, "Hey, what are we going to do this week?
[time=3203] How are we going to make a difference?" Just maybe in a small way, how are we going to do this time with them as a family?
[time=3212] Maybe it's a dad and a couple kids. Maybe it's a mom and just one of the kids.
[time=3216] However you work it out, I just want to try and invite you, parents, today, to think about trying to partner with your kids or your family to do something this week beyond yourself, beyond your schedule, beyond your agenda.
[time=3232] Something that would allow you to carry and pass along God's grace and his kindness and his compassion to somebody who might need it.
[time=3242] And don't be surprised when it's exhausting because evangelism is work and loving your enemies.
[time=3255] To love those who persecute you, it's exhausting. And so we should be experiencing the lack of energy that comes through exhausting work like that.
[time=3269] And that's why we look forward to being together. It's not exhausting here. It's energizing.
[time=3275] Amen. I want to just show you, if you would just stand right where you're at, just real quietly, I want to just show you where we see all this going.
[time=3282] They're just going to put it up on the screen. It's just an encouraging, more than anything, just an encouraging visual for you.
[time=3289] Time with him, time with us, time with each other, time with them. Just, if they'll just put up that slide, I want to show you where that goes at the end of the day.
[time=3299] Time with him allows you an eye to experience intimacy, intimacy with God, time with us, fellowship with the family, time with each other, encouragement in community.
[time=3311] Time with them, all of that, leading a time with them, God gets the glory as lives are transformed. All of that so that God can be lifted up.
[time=3321] All of that so that we can make much of him. All of that so that we can be a mobile priesthood that goes and passes along God to those that so desperately need him.
[time=3333] And when we do that, and when he works in that, he gets glorified. And that's what we're to be about, amen?
[time=3341] Yes. I hope if you need any help, if you need help at all with any of these four things, I just want to say it to you.
[time=3349] I'm so thankful that folks took us up on it a couple weeks ago. If you need help with any of these four things, then let us know.
[time=3356] Come talk to me. Talk to Steve. Give Josh Ring a call. We'll do whatever we can do to help move you in whatever direction you need to move in as a result of these four non-negotiable.
[time=3370] Disciplines that have got to be in play in your life and mine.
[time=3376] Father, God, we stand before you this morning so grateful for the practical direction and encouragement that we find in your word.
[time=3384] So thankful, God, that you're a God that wants to be with us. God, you want to and long to the Scripture says that you are a God who longs to be near us.
[time=3394] And so, God, as we meet with you, God, as we pursue you, God, as we make time to listen and worship and take in all that you would have for us.
[time=3403] God, I pray that you would strengthen us to be a people who would then long to be together as a family, long to be together in community.
[time=3411] And people, God, who would be willing to go and take all that you've deposited and all that you've invested in us spiritually and pass that along to others here.
[time=3423] In our family, here in our neighborhood, God, here in this town, I pray that we would be a people so very willing and ready to do that very thing.
[time=3432] Thank you for Steve. God, thank you for his years and his wisdom. Thank you for the encouragement that he is to me and to this family.
[time=3440] God, we pray for Mitchell this morning. We pray for Mitch as he flies today to the Philippines for a nine-day opportunity to speak and teach and encourage so many in that setting, so many that are giving themselves to the church today.
[time=3458] In a poverty-stricken, persecuted place, God, we pray you'd give him protection. We pray you'd give him great strength and bring him home safely.
[time=3467] Thank you, God, for what we'll experience this afternoon. Many of us know what that will be. Others of us don't.
[time=3472] We have no idea what you have in store for us, but, oh, God, I pray that you'd give us strength to meet those opportunities with great grace and with great wisdom.
[time=3481] In your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=3497] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
