[time=348] I am Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I am thankful again to be able to welcome you to the Bible Hour broadcast.
[time=355] You know what was just earlier this week that I was here in our Bible Hour studio, and I was spending some time talking with Ed Richard, who has been a part of and really giving leadership to the Bible Hour team for almost 25 years.
[time=368] And as Ed and I talked about the Bible Hour, and as we were discussing some things about our broadcast, it dawned on us both that the Bible Hour has been a part of this community, people like you have been watching the Bible Hour for 32 years.
[time=385] That's right, 32 years, and we've learned a lot over that span of time from Dr. David Jeremiah to Pastor Rick Hawks, Pastor Russell Moore, and then myself, this incredible privilege that God's given me to be a part of this legacy, a legacy that from the beginning has attempted to simply really do one thing.
[time=405] And that is share with you our viewing audience the life-changing, eternity-altering truth of God's Word.
[time=413] And we're so thankful that you're a part of this, and we are just thrilled to be able to in our 32nd year continue to bring this to you week after week.
[time=422] I want to give you an opportunity that I give you every once in a while, a couple, two, three times a year.
[time=427] I'll just ask you to pause and stop and go to a computer, or if you're still writing notes, write notes. I would love to, we would love to hear from you.
[time=436] Sometimes it really does our team well to know that these efforts to bring the broadcast to you, that God's really using the broadcast to encourage you, to help you, to redirect and maybe point you in a new direction.
[time=450] Maybe on a weekly basis, the broadcast is something that really brings to your heart and mind a sense of stability. I don't know how God uses it, but if He does, we would love to hear from you.
[time=461] I'd love for you to just write me a note or email me. There's an email address right here at the bottom. You're welcome to shoot it to me directly. I'd love to hear from you.
[time=470] We'd love to be able to pass these notes of encouragement along to our Bible Hour team. I know how hard they work, and I know how much it is on their heart, that God would use this effort to really touch and impact lives.
[time=484] And so if your life is being touched, if your heart is being impacted, I'd love to hear from you. Take just a minute this week. Would you? Shoot me an email and let us know how God has used the broadcast in your life.
[time=497] I'm really thankful for you. We consider you part of the Black Hawk family, and I'm so grateful that we get to spend these times together.
[time=505] Come by some Sunday morning and see us live and in person. We'd love to meet you. We'd love to put some names and faces together. I hope you have a great week.
[time=514] As always, God bless you, and we hope to see you soon.
[time=535] Peace and rest, I don't want to end up where you found me. And it echoes in my mind, keeps me awake at night.
[time=550] I know you've cast my sin as far as the east is from the west, and I stand before you now west.
[time=561] So I've never sinned, but today I feel like I'm just one mistake away, from you leaving me this way.
[time=572] Jesus, can you show me just how far the east is from the west?
[time=581] 'Cause I can't fancy the man I've been come rising up in me again in the arms of your mercy at my rest.
[time=594] 'Cause you know just how far the east is from the west, from one scarred hand to the other.
[time=611] I start today, the world begins, endless reminding of my sin.
[time=622] Time and time again, your truth is drowned out by the storm I'm in.
[time=628] Today I feel like I'm just one mistake away, from you leaving me this way.
[time=637] Jesus, can you show me just how far the east is from the west?
[time=646] 'Cause I can't fancy the man I've been come rising up in me again in the arms of your mercy at my rest.
[time=659] 'Cause you know just how far the east is from the west, from one scarred hand to the other.
[time=668] I know you've washed me white, turned my darkness into light.
[time=675] I need your peace to get me through, to get me through this night.
[time=681] I can't live by what I feel, but by the truth the world reveals I'm not holding on to you.
[time=691] I'm holding on to me, holding on to me, holding on to me.
[time=704] Jesus, you know just how far the east is from the west.
[time=712] I don't have to take the man I've been, rising up in me again in the arms of your mercy at my rest.
[time=725] 'Cause you know just how far the east is from the west, from one scarred hand to the other.
[time=734] Just how far the east is from the west, just how far the west is from the west, just how far the east is from the west, just how far the west is from the west, from one scarred hand to the other.
[time=764] James 1, starting with verse 22 says, "Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves, do what it says.
[time=778] Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror, and after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
[time=793] But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it, he will be blessed in what he does."
[time=808] Thank you, Susie. Thank you very much.
[time=834] At the time right before we would bring the message that morning, and maybe you've noticed it the last several weeks, he just felt like it was good for us to hear from James chapter 1, and that passage has just been being read again and again week after week.
[time=851] Corbin felt like it was a good reminder for us as a family.
[time=855] To be reminded week after week that the word of God has taught and the truth has proclaimed, and God's heart and desire is that you and I would be not just hearers of the word but what doers, that we would do what it says, that we would practice.
[time=872] And I told him, I said, you know, it was amazing, you know, not trying to be cute, not trying to be funny, just as he thought about doing that week after week ice in a similar way, and I told him.
[time=884] I thought recently, I thought about just, you know, so that we keep it real and honest, and so that we're all making sure that we're on the same page.
[time=894] I thought about just standing up every week, and I told him, I thought, maybe I'll just stand up every week and just say, and I've never been to an AA meeting.
[time=904] Some of you have been, and I'm thankful that you have been, we're grateful that you've been.
[time=910] I've had friends who have been, and if I understand it right, I believe in those meetings, everybody goes around and each person has the chance to say hi, I'm Kelly.
[time=920] And everybody says, and I was thinking about saying, hi, I'm Kelly, and everybody would say, hi, Kelly, and I would say, I'm a sinner.
[time=933] Say, by grace, through faith, and our glorious Lord and Jesus Christ, and everybody would say, so are we.
[time=944] How's that? Not a bad idea, maybe we'll try it sometime.
[time=949] But I think for us to be reminded of being doers of the word, good for us to be reminded, that we're sinners.
[time=957] Say, by grace, through faith, the lamb has overcome, and we are free.
[time=964] It's a great, great truth.
[time=966] Hey, this morning, I am exceedingly, like, really, like, way high up off the chart, excited.
[time=974] This morning, I was getting ready. My wife actually just put her hand on my shoulder and told me to calm down.
[time=980] I was a little wound up today. Still am. I'm so looking forward to what's ahead for us as we begin today a study of the book of 1 John.
[time=990] I love studying the Bible. I love every chance I get to communicate this truth to you. This is just a phenomenal book.
[time=997] And there is just phenomenal truth you know in all of Scripture. I am so very excited for you to discover.
[time=1005] Some of you for the very first time, others, if you are going to be reminded of the great truth of this book.
[time=1010] And before we jump into it, I want to just give you a little backdrop as to why it is that we have chosen to it this time.
[time=1017] I'll be engaged in this with you. Mitchell and Steve will come alongside and we're going to, I don't know how long it's going to last.
[time=1023] I don't know exactly where it's going to take us, but I am so looking forward to what you're going to see and what we are going to discover together as we make our way through 1 John.
[time=1034] Now, here's how this transpired. And this is very important. It's very significant. I want you to hear this for about a year now, maybe even over a year,
[time=1044] behind closed doors, as they say, our leadership here at Blackhawk, our elders and our pastors together, paid elders and volunteer elders.
[time=1053] Our elder team has been giving great thought and consideration. We have been begging God, if you will, to help us be even more clear on how it is he wants this family,
[time=1065] how it is he wants this ministry, our church and our school and the broadcast, how it is he wants us to function.
[time=1073] We don't just want to just do church. We don't want to just just just keep going through motions, if in fact we might be doing that in some way or the other.
[time=1081] So we have been begging God and searching the scriptures and talking amongst ourselves, asking God to give us clarity on what it is he wants us to give time and attention and focus to in the days to come.
[time=1096] And as we've done that, we believe he has been extremely clear in his response. A number of things have come to the surface, not the least of which is this.
[time=1107] And I want to say this to you this morning, and this just ties right in to a study at First John.
[time=1113] We're concerned in a good way, we're not mad, we're not angry, we're concerned.
[time=1122] We see it in a lot of places, we see this taking place in a number of different settings, and we don't want this to happen here.
[time=1131] But what happens is this, there's a concern that in churches just like this, what can happen is that you can open up those doors and people can come in and folks sit in the pews
[time=1142] and the 70 minutes goes by, and it goes by week after week after week, and all you're really growing and all you're really taking part in is feeding a bunch of attenders.
[time=1156] Instead of feeding and growing a bunch of disciples, and there's a really, really big difference.
[time=1166] And it is our hope, while we're grateful for your attendance. While we're thankful that you come through the doors, our hope and our fear is that somehow, maybe as we do what we do, week after week, all you really remain is an attender.
[time=1182] A good attender, a faithful attender, a well-meaning attender.
[time=1187] But we would want so much more for each and every one of you. We would want this time and the times that flow out of this time, this gathering, times of community, times of relationship.
[time=1200] We would want for you the privilege and the honor of knowing what it means to become more and more so, a follower of Christ, a disciple.
[time=1212] We're thankful that you're here, but we want to just kind of draw a little line in the sand, put a little stake in the ground here and say, you know what, we want to embark on a season here, where we are just incredibly intentional with all of you.
[time=1226] That what we want to be about for you who are older, for you who are younger, for you who are in between, for everybody, red, yellow, black, white, educated, uneducated, no matter if you're in school or you've got a job, whether you're married with kids or without.
[time=1244] It doesn't matter. Everybody that would call this family home, we want to do our best to equip you and teach you and paint a picture for you of what it really looks like and what it really is like to be a follower of Christ.
[time=1259] Today in this place and in your world and in your cubicle and in your classroom and in your home and in your neighborhood, a place that's intentional in trying to teach what God's Word says in a way that produces not a tenders with disciples.
[time=1277] And boy, I tell you, when you read through first John, what an amazing book, what a fundamental treatment, if you will, of that very, very issue.
[time=1287] First John, I want to, I want if I can, I want to just tell you before we jump in, I want to tell you a little bit about what's going on with first John. I want to tell you what it's about.
[time=1296] Can I do that? Yeah, a couple weeks ago I stood here and encouraged every one of you. And I've heard from many of you, we've heard from folks who saw it on the broadcast, a lot of people really encouraged as we talked about spending time with him, a fundamental component of your life and mind.
[time=1312] And when I talked to you about spending time with him, I told you, get a Bible if you don't have one, get a study Bible, I said. And when you get your study Bible, pick your book. And I said, when you pick your book, don't just jump in, go to the introduction of that book and read about it.
[time=1326] And I want to kind of give you an introduction, if you will, this morning about first John, before we ever get to first John chapter 1 verse 1. I want you to understand better what it's about, what its purpose was, who wrote it, when, to whom, what was the situation, what was the circumstance that John writes this book in?
[time=1346] When you understand those things, I'm telling you what, the truth of the book, the storyline of the book, the things that get written and said, just absolutely leap off the page when you have a really clear understanding of why it is, he wrote it.
[time=1361] So this morning I want to do my very best to kind of give you that. What is the book about? Let me just tell you this initially, and you can just write a few of these things down. What's the book about it? If you ask me to kind of get up above first John, look down, give you an overview of what it is we'll see, you could say things like this, first John is about a definition.
[time=1381] That's right, an extremely clear definition of what genuine faith looks like, what genuine faith acts like, what genuine faith thinks like. It is a definition, you could write this down. It's an explanation of the foundational principles of our faith.
[time=1402] It's really a spiritual self-examination. You saw that on the screen just a moment ago preparing for an examination. It's really a spiritual self-examination, an opportunity for you and me to, at a very basic level, test or examine the authenticity, the genuineness of our faith, of our convictions.
[time=1426] It is about a definition. It is about an explanation. It is a self-examination of our faith. My friends, John speaks to and addresses some very central components of biblical Christianity.
[time=1441] If you're interested in biblical Christianity, not religion, not denominationalism, but if there's an interest in you, or if you're one who's raising your hand professing biblical Christianity, he deals with some of the central components of biblical Christianity in a very direct and bold fashion that leaves no room for vagueness, and I'll address that in just a moment.
[time=1470] What he says is you read through first, John, he says, "This really is the way it is. Examine yourself and see where you really stand."
[time=1477] As you read it, and I hope you'll read it with us, elders and staff have been reading first, John, on a daily basis in preparation for this study.
[time=1487] We'd invite you to read it with us. It's a great read. It's a very, very good read, and as you read it, you'll see again and again him saying, "This really is the way it is.
[time=1497] "Examine yourself and see where you really are."
[time=1503] That's what it's about. That's what it's about.
[time=1507] Now, let me address this for you, and I really hope you'll stay with me here.
[time=1510] This May today, if you know us, if you've been with me before in settings like this, today might seem a little bit more teacher, classroom-ish, but I'll tell you what, there's some really good teacher classroom-ish stuff that we've got to cover today
[time=1526] for this to really make sense in the days to come, so I hope you'll bear with me. I hope you'll stay with me here.
[time=1531] I want to talk about why John wrote first, John. When you begin to understand why it will absolutely, I think it'll light your fire.
[time=1539] I think you will be even more excited about what it is we're going to discover as we dig into this study. Why did he write it?
[time=1548] He wrote it because, well, let me tell you this, he's an Ephesus, first of all. The year is A.D. 100, and John is now in, this is John the disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and John is now in his latter years.
[time=1561] He's old, and he finds himself an Ephesus, and most of you in the room know that Ephesus was an incredible place.
[time=1568] It had become, in some ways, the central hub of commerce and trade and politics.
[time=1573] Even spiritually, the church there at Ephesus had grown enormously. What Paul had done there, God had blessed, so now we're down A.D. 100.
[time=1582] Okay, some years have gone by since the original message was given, and John writes to make sure that we're clear on some things.
[time=1596] Because, you know, after a few years, sometimes you need to get clear on some things.
[time=1603] Make sense? I think about my kids. I think about your kids, you know, and pick the issue. You know, we haven't gotten to driving yet, but there's other things that we're dealing with, and we'll get to driving soon.
[time=1616] I think about some of the talks I've had with a 15-year-old, you know, a couple years ago when he was 13.
[time=1628] There have been some very strategic, very purposeful discussions entered into with great fear and trepidation, I might add.
[time=1635] But nonetheless, there have been some significant conversations that we've tried to have, because we felt like they were important.
[time=1642] And so you have them, and you communicate what's on your heart, and you do your best to kind of prop them up with support and love and encouragement.
[time=1649] It's very best to instill some values, and you talk through scenarios and situations, and then off they go.
[time=1654] And then you find yourself 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months later going, "Whoa, I think we might need to revisit that."
[time=1661] And those are good conversations, especially when you think about your kids in mind, with all that's at stake, with all that's on the line,
[time=1669] it's always good to come back and revisit some foundational principles that have got to be remembered, and not just remembered, but embraced.
[time=1678] That's what John's doing here. John is looking at the church in Ephesus, and he's going, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, time out."
[time=1688] We've got to come back, and we've got to address some very fundamental things, and there was a reason, number one, their faith was fading.
[time=1697] It happens. You understand that?
[time=1700] It happens. Their faith was fading. By AD 100, certain things had almost inevitably happened within the church there at Ephesus.
[time=1708] Many were now second or even third generation Christians.
[time=1713] The thrill of the first days had, to some extent, passed away.
[time=1717] In the first days of Christianity, there was a rush, a sense of glory and splendor, but now Christianity had become a thing of habit for some, always a bad thing,
[time=1728] when following Christ becomes a thing of habit.
[time=1733] Charles Barkley here uses words like traditional, half-hearted, nominal, men had grown used to it, and something of the wonder was lost.
[time=1745] John was riding at a time when, for some at least, the first thrill was gone, and the flame of devotion had died to a flicker.
[time=1755] This is why he writes. Their faith was fading.
[time=1759] Another reason why he writes is that in their fading, watch this, in their fading faith, what was once a flame that was now a flicker, what often happens, it happened then, and you and I see it happening now.
[time=1770] We see it in others, and we see it in ourselves.
[time=1773] Not only was their faith fading, but now they were hesitant to be holy.
[time=1780] That's right. They were hesitant to be holy.
[time=1783] There were members of the church, listen, there were members of the church who found the standards which Christianity demanded to be a burden.
[time=1792] And isn't that just, isn't it really something else?
[time=1795] And again, most of us in the room have experienced this.
[time=1798] It's just, wow, how is it that, again, at that initial moment, in those early days when you were redeemed, and those initial times when you and I got transformed, he could have asked you to do anything.
[time=1812] He could have asked me to go anywhere, and we would have said what?
[time=1815] Yes, absolutely. Be happy to.
[time=1817] Now, three, four, five, ten, fifteen years go by, and he's asking the same things, and they're a burden to you.
[time=1826] They're bothersome to me.
[time=1829] John saw that those in Ephesus didn't want to be saints.
[time=1834] Saints, that's right, priests.
[time=1836] That word we talked about in our recent series.
[time=1840] I'm a priest.
[time=1841] They did not want to be saints or priests in the New Testament sense of the term.
[time=1845] The New Testament word for saint, you'll remember, is hagios, H-A-G-I-O-S, hagios, which is also commonly translated as, remember, holy.
[time=1857] Holy.
[time=1858] It's basic meaning was that they were to be different.
[time=1862] They were to be unique.
[time=1863] They were to not be like any others.
[time=1867] The temple.
[time=1868] I mean, just think about it. The temple was hagios.
[time=1872] The temple was hagios, because it was different from all other buildings.
[time=1878] The Sabbath was hagios, because it was different from any other day.
[time=1883] The Jewish nation was to be hagios, holy, unique, because it was different from other peoples, and the Christ follower.
[time=1892] The Christ follower was to be hagios, because he or she was called to be different, set apart from other men.
[time=1901] There was always to be a distinct difference between the Christian and the culture.
[time=1907] Christians have always been called by God to impact culture, but there was always to be foundationally in our makeup and in our values,
[time=1916] and in our thinking, and in our living, this difference in who we are and the way we live.
[time=1927] Jesus said, and you can write this down, Jesus said in John 15.
[time=1933] In John 15, if you were of the world, he says in John 15, 19, you were of the world, the world would love you,
[time=1940] because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world, what?
[time=1947] Hates you. Fundamentally, foundationally, that's how that oftentimes works.
[time=1953] Following Christ, you see, this is good for us as we think about what it means to be Christ followers, not attenders.
[time=1961] Following Christ involved a new way of living.
[time=1965] It demanded a new standard, look at this, a new standard of moral purity.
[time=1969] It required a new kindness.
[time=1971] It required a new kind of service.
[time=1973] It required a new kind of forgiveness.
[time=1976] It required a new patience.
[time=1978] It required a new tolerance.
[time=1984] And once the first thrill, William Barkley says once the first thrill and enthusiasm were gone, it became harder and harder to stand out
[time=1992] against the world and to refuse to conform to the generally accepted standards and practices of that age.
[time=2000] In that time, they're in Ephesus.
[time=2002] Sound familiar?
[time=2004] Why are they right? Because their faith was fading.
[time=2009] They were hesitant to be holy.
[time=2011] And you know what else you can add this?
[time=2013] They thought they needed more.
[time=2014] That's true.
[time=2015] Let me explain that to you.
[time=2016] They thought they actually needed more.
[time=2019] When you read First John, as we've been reading it on a regular basis around here, when you read it, you'll see that there are no signs
[time=2028] that the church to which it was written there in Ephesus was being persecuted.
[time=2033] There are places we can go in the New Testament where clearly the audience to which the letters being written are an audience.
[time=2041] They are a church who is undergoing persecution from the outside.
[time=2046] As you read First John, you realize that is not the case.
[time=2050] Barkley says the peril as it has been put was not persecution from without but seduction from within.
[time=2060] Jesus had foreseen this when he said in Matthew 24, "Many false prophets," he said, "will arise from within and lead many astray."
[time=2070] And it's ironic, my friends. It really is. This was the exact same danger that the Apostle Paul, if you go to Acts chapter 20,
[time=2080] you'll read there an amazing scene where Paul is leaving some very dear friends that he loved from a place where he administered.
[time=2091] And God had built this church there through Paul, and Paul's leaving them. And these are the folks who were a part of the church at what?
[time=2099] In Acts 20, it's talking about his departure from Ephesus. It's the exact same church just years before.
[time=2105] And as Paul left that very same church that John now writes to, Paul says in Acts 20, you see it right there.
[time=2112] "I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock."
[time=2120] And he says back, actually verse 28, go back to 28 if you can. I don't know if you can get 28 up there. In Acts 20, verse 28 he says,
[time=2130] "And from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them."
[time=2137] Paul declared that very thing. Paul declared that there would be those from within who would come and do damage to the flock.
[time=2146] And he called it. He called it right there on the beach outside Ephesus. Now John writes, "And the trouble which first John seeks to address, again, didn't come from men out to destroy the Christian faith,
[time=2157] but from men who thought from within that they were going to improve it." That's right.
[time=2162] That's right. It came from men whose aim was to make Christianity intellectually respectable.
[time=2169] There's a lot of that going around. People wanting to take Christianity, biblical Christianity and somehow kind of tweak it or make it more,
[time=2178] because somehow, some way they see it as deficient. And there were those in Ephesus who thought it was deficient.
[time=2187] They wanted to make it intellectually respectable. They knew the intellectual tendencies and currents of the day
[time=2193] and felt that the time had come for Christianity to come to terms with secular philosophy and contemporary thought.
[time=2202] They thought it needed more. And I could just stop there, but then the more I read and the more you look into it,
[time=2211] you don't want me to stop there. You really need me. And we're going to this morning. I want to tell you a little bit more about the more.
[time=2219] They felt they needed more. I want to explain to you this morning what it was that they specifically felt like they needed more of,
[time=2228] because I won't say too much right now, but the truth of the matter is not much has changed. Watch this. Here's the more.
[time=2236] What was the more? The more was a prevailing thought in that day. It was sweeping the culture. And it was sweeping deep into the culture.
[time=2246] It was a philosophy called Gnosticism. And I won't play Spelling Bee here. I'll just let you write it down. Gnosticism.
[time=2255] And Gnosticism was an incredibly dangerous way of thinking. And it was creeping into the life and the thinking of those in the church. Gnosticism.
[time=2266] The basic belief, here you go, you can write this down. The basic belief of all Gnostic thought was that only the spirit was good.
[time=2274] Only the spiritual stuff was good. The spirit was good. And matter, physicalness, matter, body was essentially evil.
[time=2287] The spirit and the spirit world were good. Matter and physicalness was evil. That spirit, Gnostic said, that spirit was a seed of God,
[time=2298] who was altogether good. So then the aim of life then must be to release this heavenly seed imprisoned in the evil of the body.
[time=2311] That could be done only by a secret knowledge, a secret gnosis, Greek word for knowledge. The only way you could arrive, the only way you could get there,
[time=2324] was if you attained to this secret, an exclusive level of knowledge, an elaborate ritual which only the true and deep Gnostic could supply.
[time=2339] This thought is carried out. This philosophy was being taught by false teachers. And John talks about, this is where it gets really cool.
[time=2349] If you open your Bibles, do that. If you haven't already, go to 1 John. And as I'm taking you through this intro and we're talking about why he wrote,
[time=2358] it's just so cool to be able to take you to these verses where he's clearly addressing these very things that we see to be true,
[time=2367] that we see to be going on in history at that time when he wrote this. False teachers had come up from within the church.
[time=2376] Many had left, but they were spreading this message. I want you to see it for yourself, 1 John 2 19.
[time=2383] 1 John 2 19, you see it there? It says they went out from us. There you go. They went out from us, 1 John 2 19, but they were not really of us.
[time=2393] For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But they went out. They were men, these false teachers were.
[time=2402] They were men of influence, for they claimed to be prophets. Look at 1 John 4 1.
[time=2407] Paul, John addresses it here. 1 John 4 1, beloved, do not believe every spirit or every voice or every false teacher,
[time=2415] but test the spirits to see whether they are from God because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[time=2426] Many false prophets, although they had left the church, they still were trying to disseminate their teaching and their philosophy within the church,
[time=2436] trying to seduce its members away from the faith. You see that in 1 John 2 26, go back just a page or two to 1 John 2 26 right there.
[time=2446] These things I have written to you. This is why I write. See it? Concerning those who are trying to what? Say it out loud.
[time=2455] Deceive you. Deceive you. He writes concerning those who are trying to deceive the church. That's the biggie.
[time=2465] That's a huge thing. That's me coming back to one of my kids going, "Wait a minute. With all at stake, we've got to talk this through again."
[time=2472] It's John coming over here to the bride of Christ going, "Wait a minute. I know you've got a good foundation, but things are starting to slide.
[time=2478] We've got to get this straight again."
[time=2485] Gnosticism promoted by false teachers. And you want to know how bad it got? You want to know how scary this thing was?
[time=2493] It was a philosophy that began to attack one of the most foundational truths in all of Scripture, that being the incarnation of Christ.
[time=2505] The incarnation of Christ that Christ became man and died and was raised again, that Christ was fully God in His deity and fully man in His incarnate state.
[time=2518] You've got to remember here's how that worked. It's basically pretty simple, just deadly in its implications.
[time=2525] The way it worked in Gnosticism is that from the Gnostic point of view, remember what I said, the spirit alone was good and the physical matter utterly evil.
[time=2537] Given that, the point of view was among the Gnostics that any real incarnation is impossible, absolutely impossible for anything spiritual to somehow come and dwell inside something physical, and the good of the spiritual not be tainted by the evil of the physical.
[time=2557] They absolutely repudiated the incarnation of Christ, and they were beginning to teach it, and they were beginning to say it.
[time=2567] You can hear it. You can hear it as John responds. The word 1 John 4, 2 and 3, right back to where we were a moment ago, 1 John 4, by this you know the Spirit of God.
[time=2579] Every spirit, this is how you know what's true. It says every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the, what, say it.
[time=2589] Flesh is from God. He's addressing this stuff just right here out in the open. It's awesome, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus in the flesh is not from God.
[time=2600] This is the spirit of the Antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world.
[time=2610] What was the more? The more was Gnosticism. This Gnosticism was promoted by false teachers who denied the incarnation of Christ, and John is concerned as he should be.
[time=2623] This is why the book is written. Now I'll tell you one more thing, why the book is written, and why it's so important for us to study this book, because there are implications of Gnosticism.
[time=2637] There were implications in that day, and I want to show you just a few here in a moment. Gnosticism was spreading, and there were implications at a very practical level that were beginning to affect the church, and though we don't today walk around calling our philosophy of the day Gnosticism, just watch, just listen as we go through this today.
[time=2664] Really clear over here, John addresses that I want you to think about what's going on today in your heart, in your soul, in your world, in this culture, in our day, in the church, even.
[time=2675] Watch this, practical implications of Gnosticism. In Gnostic thinking, remember, the body did not matter, and therefore its appetites might be gratified without limit.
[time=2693] Wow, just write down, free. One of the practical implications was free, it was like free sin.
[time=2701] It was like there were just some things that you could just do, since the body was in any event evil, it made no difference what a man did with it, the body.
[time=2711] And there's echoes of this all through the letter. John calls you, he calls people liars who say they know God and yet do not keep God's commandments.
[time=2726] A man who says that he abides in Christ, John says, in chapter 2, 4 to 6, auto walk as Christ walked.
[time=2735] There were clearly Gnostics in this community that John addresses who claimed special knowledge of God, but whose conduct was far removed from what God had called them to be and how God had called them to live.
[time=2750] Watch this, in some situations, William Barkley says, in some situations this Gnostic belief went even further, but Gnostic was the man who had gnosis, knowledge, right?
[time=2761] Some held that the real Gnostic must, and the really deep Gnostic must therefore know the best as well as the worst and must enter into every experience of life at its highest or at its deepest, darkest level.
[time=2778] It might almost be said that such men held that it was an obligation to sin.
[time=2787] There's a reference of this kind of thought and John's, you know, John wrote Revelation, same guy. And when John in the book of Revelation, in the portion of Revelation, which is a letter to the church at Thyatira, says in Revelation 2, 24, he said Christ refers to those who have known the deep things of Satan.
[time=2809] It may well be that John is referring to these people when he insists in John 1 John 1, 5, go there, would you look at 1 John 1, 5, John may very well be referring to these folks.
[time=2821] In 1 John 1, 5, when he says this is the message we have heard from him and announce to you that God is what? Say it out loud, light.
[time=2831] And in him there is no darkness at all. No darkness at all. These Gnostics would have held that there was in God not only blazing light but deep darkness.
[time=2846] Imagine that. And that a man must penetrate both. It's easy to see. If we're talking about the practical implications of this philosophy on the church, it is easy to see the disastrous consequences of such a belief.
[time=2862] Imagine if you and I left this place week after week. Imagine if we came into this place, you and me, week after week, leaving this place without a care in the world of what we did physically.
[time=2875] Saying what we say, preaching what we preach, standing for what we supposedly stand for and then going into this community, your world in mind without a care of our physical conduct, our moral conduct, our ethical conduct.
[time=2891] No wonder he was concerned.
[time=2895] Practical implication of Gnosticism. Free sin. Number two, write this down. Spiritual perfectionism. Spiritual perfectionism.
[time=2906] There was another kind of Gnostic belief. The true Gnostic regarded himself as an altogether spiritual man as in having shed all the material, physical, evil things of life and having released his spirit from the bondage of matter.
[time=2924] Such Gnostics held that they were so spiritual, so spiritual that they were above and beyond sin and had reached some level of spiritual arrival.
[time=2937] They had in their minds because of what they knew and because of what they read and because of where they hung out and who they were with and how they carried themselves.
[time=2946] There was this sense of spiritual perfectionism and it is to them that John refers to when he speaks of those. Again, the book speaks to the issues. I love it.
[time=2957] It's to that very group of people that John refers to when he speaks of those who deceive themselves. Look at 1 John 1 8.
[time=2966] It was, he says in 1 John 1 8, if we say that we have no sin, you might as well just, it's like he's saying, hey Gnostics.
[time=2976] If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, Josh said this to us this morning.
[time=2990] There's John 1 9. If we confess our sins though, we readily admit the presence of sin. He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all in righteousness.
[time=3003] If we say that we have not sinned, we make him Christ a liar and his word is not in us.
[time=3013] Just a reminder that John gives to those in this culture, just a reminder for you and I today, nobody, nobody is that spiritual.
[time=3025] You may have read some books and you may have been to a lot of seminars and you may even have some diplomas hanging on your wall, but you and I are sinful.
[time=3036] And we remain in the battle with sin until the day we go to be with the Lord.
[time=3044] Sinful.
[time=3046] Practical implications of Gnosticism, free sin, spiritual perfectionism.
[time=3051] Lastly, Gnosticism brought about the destruction of Christian fellowship. This, my friends, is huge.
[time=3058] This may be the most detrimental thing that John sees going on.
[time=3064] It was absolutely contrary to what God had designed, the destruction of Christian fellowship.
[time=3071] If you say how that happened, well just listen, we've seen that the Gnostic aimed at the release of the Spirit from the prison house of the evil body by means of an elaborate and high and lofty knowledge.
[time=3086] Clearly, such a knowledge was not for every man, ordinary people who were too involved, too involved in the everyday of life and work of the world ever to have time for the study and the discipline necessary to reach such lofty places.
[time=3103] And even if they had such time, many people were intellectually incapable of grasping the involved speculations of Gnostic theosophy and philosophy, so-called Gnostic thinking.
[time=3118] The result was absolutely detrimental, absolutely deadly, and very clear. The Gnostics produced a spiritual aristocracy who looked down with contempt and even hatred on lesser men.
[time=3135] This is what was going on in Ephesus. This is what John is beginning to hear. This is what John was beginning to see.
[time=3142] He was beginning to see right within the church, the beginnings of Gnosticism that were starting to spread, and within the body, people are starting to despise, what?
[time=3156] People starting to despise others. In the same church, in the same bride, in the same body, were back in Acts 2 in Jerusalem.
[time=3167] Remember, they were living together, and they were working together, and they were hearing the apostles teaching together.
[time=3175] They were breaking bread from house to house. They were sharing all that they had in common.
[time=3180] There wasn't any of them, it said, in Acts who had a need. All of them, giving, and all of them serving, and all of them loving.
[time=3189] It didn't matter who they were, where they were from. Ethnicity didn't matter. Education didn't matter.
[time=3196] Social, we cannot, didn't matter. We're Christ followers, and we're in this together. We've come from that in Acts 2 now to AD 100, John's going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.
[time=3208] We've got to come back and think this through.
[time=3215] That is why John insists, can't wait for you to see this.
[time=3220] That's why John insists all over, and all through his letter, that the true test of Christianity is love for each other.
[time=3233] If we really write these down, we're going to end with this. If we're really walking in the light, we have fellowship with each other, 1 John 1, 7.
[time=3242] He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in fact in the darkness, 1 John 2, 9 to 11.
[time=3250] The proof that we have passed from dark to light is that we love the brethren. 1 John 3, 14 to 17.
[time=3258] The marks of Christianity are belief in Christ and love for the brethren. 1 John 3, 23, God is love, and he who does not love does not know God at all.
[time=3273] You don't even know him at all, he says. If you're not and I'm not deeply, sacrificially, agape-ish, loving each other, willing, ready, just point me in a direction.
[time=3286] Who can I care for? Who can I come alongside?
[time=3292] The commandment is that he who loves God must love his brother as well, and he who says he loves God, and at the same time hates his brother, talks about her on the phone with friends.
[time=3302] Talks about him with other guys at the ballgame, excludes them from certain gatherings because they're just too hard to beat with.
[time=3317] That person, John says, is branded as a liar, and faith is not in them. 1 John 4, 20 and 21. The Gnostic, to put it bluntly, would have said that the mark of true faith is contempt for ordinary men.
[time=3336] John insists in every single chapter of 1 John that the mark of true faith is love for every man.
[time=3346] And I can't wait to jump into it with you. I cannot wait for us to dive in and dive in, we will do, and I just want to remind you as we go over here this morning.
[time=3355] I hope that didn't seem too, too, too, too, too, to teach your classroom-ish. You know what? The fact of the matter is, I gave you some history there on a thing called Gnosticism that is still, listen, that is still alive today.
[time=3370] And if you're going, what do you mean, well, I'm just telling you, those things we just went through, the implications of that philosophy, just look around us, my friend.
[time=3382] I think we could use some help with our view of sin. And 1 John's going to give us that help and that reminder that spiritual perfectionism, none of you would raise your hand.
[time=3394] I don't think and say, "I'm spiritually perfect." Anybody? Come on. Any takers? Nobody's going to raise their hand and say, "I'm spiritually elite."
[time=3405] But yet we act like it. Sometimes. We act like it. There's so much for us to learn. Fellowship. I know we've made some progress.
[time=3417] We've got some more to make. 1 John's going to help us get there. I'm so thankful for the study that's ahead.
[time=3422] I hope you'll come back, hope you'll come back week after week and be a part of this with us. We're thankful for you. We're glad you attend.
[time=3430] But we don't want you to just attend. We want to grow you into a fully surrendered disciple, a Christ follower who knows and understands what that looks like in the everyday of life.
[time=3443] Let me pray for us as we go and let me mention this to you as you leave. If you'd like to pray with us this morning, if there's anybody in here who's got a physical or spiritual need, if there's questions that you've got, we've got some guys down here in the front who would love nothing more than to pray with you today. We're thankful that you're here.
[time=3460] And Father God, we do thank you for this time. God, we thank you for the great truth of your word. And we look forward to what you'll teach us in the days to come. God, thank you for this time.
[time=3472] Grow us and prepare us today for what you have for us as we go through these times together in 1 John. Well, thank you for it. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
