[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age.
[time=49] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=54] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I want to welcome
[time=65] you again to the Bible Hour, and I want to say to you again what a privilege it is for us to be able to share this time with you.
[time=73] It really is something we look forward to.
[time=75] I met a dad and his two daughters last week after first hour.
[time=79] I met an entire family after our second service last week, all of whom were there after having watched the broadcast for, in one case, a few weeks, and in another case, a couple of months.
[time=91] And I hear the same thing again and again from people.
[time=94] They just get to a point where they figure, "You know what?
[time=96] We might as well go and see these people and experience this worship service in person."
[time=103] And it was great to meet them in person, and we want to just extend that invitation to you again and again and again.
[time=109] It's good to have you with us.
[time=111] Hey, I want to tell you a little bit about what you're going to see today.
[time=114] It is the second part in what will, I think, be probably a multiple week, possibly several
[time=120] month long study of the book of 1 John.
[time=124] And I want to just set this up for you today by asking you this question.
[time=127] Have you ever heard someone tell a story and kind of wonder if it was true?
[time=133] Have you ever heard someone tell you about an event or a circumstance that they encountered?
[time=139] And it just seems so amazing.
[time=141] It seems so out of this world that you just wondered in the back of your mind if it was really substantive, if it was really, really true.
[time=149] Well, the story of Jesus, the central story of God's redemptive history, is an amazing
[time=156] story, and I can't wait for you today to see the reliability of this source, the person
[time=164] of John, this book of 1 John that so lays out for us the foundations of our faith.
[time=170] John himself is what many would call a credible source, and when you read and when you study
[time=176] with us today, how credible he was.
[time=180] When you begin to see the background that this man brings to his story, it is an amazing
[time=186] thing.
[time=187] I know it brings a great deal of comfort and a great deal of confidence to me when I think about the validity of our faith.
[time=195] Maybe you question sometimes, maybe you wonder about our faith, maybe you wonder if it's really, really true.
[time=202] Well, I want to invite you today to listen to this study of 1 John 1 verses 1 to 4, and
[time=208] I bet you as you listen and as you read along and as you allow the spirit to encourage you,
[time=214] you will be so amazed at the great validity and reliability of this source, John, as he
[time=221] shares with us the story of Christ.
[time=224] God bless you.
[time=225] I'm thankful that you're with us, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=232] I saw one hanging on a tree in agony and blood, who fixed his loving eyes on me as near his
[time=255] cross I stood, and never to my dying breath will I forget that look.
[time=266] It seemed to charge me with his death, though not a word he spoke.
[time=281] My conscience felt and owned the guilt, and plunged me in despair.
[time=289] I saw my sins, his blood it's built, and helped a nail in there, but with a second look he
[time=300] said I freely all forgive, this blood is for your ransom paid, I died that you might live.
[time=318] For ever it's upon my mind is the look of him who died, the lamb I crucified, and now
[time=338] my life will sing the praise of pure toning grace that looked on me and gladly took my
[time=358] life.
[time=368] Thus while his death my sin displays for all the world to view, such is the mystery of
[time=379] grace.
[time=380] It seals my part into, with pleasing grief and mournful joy.
[time=388] My spirit now is filled, that I should such a life destroy, yet live by him I killed.
[time=407] For ever it's upon my mind is the look of him who died, the lamb I crucified, and now
[time=425] my life will sing the praise, a pure toning grace that looked on me and took my place.
[time=440] For ever it's upon my mind is the look of him who died, the lamb I crucified.
[time=455] And now my life will sing the praise of pure toning grace that looked on me and gladly
[time=472] took my place.
[time=485] Well I want to invite you to open your Bibles to 1 John, would you do that?
[time=494] 1 John, back toward the very back of the New Testament, we began this study last week.
[time=499] As I said to you then, it will probably be a lengthy and I hope very significant and very enlightening and I hope very encouraging study for you as we just kind of make our way through this book section by section.
[time=512] I want to draw your attention to the screen this morning if I can, and we've entitled this talk this morning a reliable source, a reliable source, and we're going to talk
[time=521] a little bit more this morning.
[time=523] We're going to actually actually dive into some text, last week was just all introduction.
[time=528] This week we're going to dive into the text 1 John 1 1 to 4 and as we do that we're going to again kind of be brought face to face with the guy who writes this.
[time=538] We're going to be brought face to face again with the amazing story of the Apostle John.
[time=544] And I've got that on the screen for a purpose this morning, a reliable source, a reliable
[time=550] source.
[time=551] Let me just ask you this honestly, we'll just be right out of the gate here, we'll just be as real as we can be.
[time=560] Have you ever heard a story, have you ever heard someone relay a story to you, have you
[time=566] ever been with some friends, have you ever been out to dinner, have you ever been any settings kids, students, have you ever been somewhere at lunch and somebody tells a story and you just kind of wonder if it's really true.
[time=578] Raise your hand if you've ever wondered if a story, yeah, everybody, absolutely.
[time=583] Sometimes you just wonder, did it really happen that way, did it really go down like that.
[time=590] Let me ask you this, have you ever wondered you personally if your faith is real.
[time=606] Have you ever just in those moments where we're just kind of alone with ourselves and our thoughts, have you ever wondered if all of this that you've staked your life on.
[time=619] Those of you in the room who have fully surrendered your hearts and lives to Christ, have you ever had those moments where you just kind of look at the whole thing and go, gosh, I
[time=630] wonder if it's really true.
[time=633] I mean, I wonder if it's really true, I wonder if I'm going to come to the end and maybe
[time=642] wake up and it all just be like a real bad spiritual nightmare and it not be at all like
[time=648] they always told me it was.
[time=650] I mean, do you ever just in your own thoughts, in your own confusion, in your own wondering, ever questioned, have you ever questioned the validity of this.
[time=660] Let's raise your hands if you have, yeah, mind's up, mind's up.
[time=670] I want to just encourage you this morning, I really do.
[time=673] There's two tracks that we're going to go down today, very, very close together that I think are going to kind of even overlap as we go, but there's something I want to say to you first and I want to read this to you and I want you to think about what we were just saying there about the validity and the reliability of our faith and I want you just
[time=691] to read how John, with that question in mind that you've asked and I've asked, millions
[time=697] of us have asked, I want you just to be encouraged this morning as you listen to what the Apostle
[time=704] John says in 1 John 1 1 to 4.
[time=706] Would you stand in honor of God's word and let me just read this to you.
[time=711] What was from the beginning, he starts out, verse 1, what was from the beginning what
[time=717] we have, and here he goes, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have
[time=724] looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life, Christ, and the life Christ
[time=735] was manifested, made, made real, took the form of human flesh and the life was manifested
[time=745] and we have seen and testified and proclaimed to you the eternal life which was with the
[time=752] Father and was manifested, made real, made physical to us, what we have seen, what we
[time=762] have heard, we proclaim to you also so that you too may have fellowship with us and indeed
[time=770] our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ, these things we write
[time=778] so that our say it out loud, joy, not our wandering, not our questioning, but our joy
[time=785] so that our joy, our confidence, may be complete.
[time=792] You can have a seat.
[time=794] I want to just do something here to just, and I'm not trying to be cute, I'm not trying to be funny, I want to just show you kind of in a real life example when we talk about the reliability of John for instance, right?
[time=809] This is John, remember last week this is John, the Apostle John, this is him writing from Ephesus and this is him later in life, this is a good, you know, 60 years or so later
[time=818] from the Gospels, this guy's, he's old, he's aging and now he looks back and I'm sure after
[time=824] just a few decades, let alone 2,000 years, after a few decades there are those who are
[time=831] beginning to wonder that there are those who are beginning to question just like you and I do at times wondering gosh is this really true, all that I've staked my life on here,
[time=843] this faith that I've entered into and so he writes and I just love it, did that encourage you as you read that with me?
[time=851] What he had heard, what he had seen, what he had looked at, what he had touched, what
[time=857] had been made manifest, what he had seen, he proclaims to us so that our joy can be made
[time=863] complete.
[time=864] There's some beautiful stuff there that we're going to come back to, but there's some reliability in that.
[time=869] It's a great thing when someone's been there, Keith, would you come up here, I want to just, most of you know Pastor Keith Moore, Keith's a part of our, Keith and Catherine,
[time=878] part of our Black Hawk family and Keith has been for me, I think Keith's been working on our staff in the area of visitation and counseling and coming alongside folks for
[time=889] about maybe since not when I started in '99, we've kind of been at this together and I'm
[time=896] so thankful for Keith, Keith is a, Keith's a spiritual encouragement to me, just in my
[time=902] personal life to see him and Catherine after how many years of marriage, 58 years of marriage,
[time=911] to see the, to see the marriage, to see the marriage at 58 years, I said this to a group
[time=920] on our staff, staff people, we were meeting with this week, I'm always grateful for the more after 58 years of marriage, I love that it's still authentic, they're a part of our
[time=930] small group, Deborah and I have a small group that meet in our home on Sunday nights and Keith and Catherine are a part of that and they talk with us openly about the hard lessons they've learned and the hard lessons, they keep learning and I just appreciate his humbleness in that, 58 years of marriage, how many years of ministry, 55 years of ministry, he's an
[time=950] encouragement to me personally, spiritually he's an encouragement to me in ministry, you
[time=956] know, I'm just about to hit my, I'm just about to hit my 22nd year, you know, and I think about 55 years, it's a huge encouragement to me, he has been a great friend and, but he's
[time=969] also, while he's all that, he also turned 84 years old yesterday, give him one more hand
[time=976] on that one, all right, so, so 84, 84 years of age, I think there's a few in here, maybe
[time=986] a little older than that and, but he was easier to get to, so that's why you're not up here and he is, I want you to think about this with me, 84 years, this man has seen some things,
[time=999] this man has experienced some things that you and I what haven't, example, I mean, I guess
[time=1007] what I'm asking you this morning is is he a reliable source, so watch this, tell him
[time=1013] about, come over here a little bit, tell him about first job, not ministry necessarily,
[time=1020] just talk about one of the first jobs you remember what you did and how much you got paid.
[time=1025] My first job was a teenager and I worked for a farmer for a dollar a day, that's what he
[time=1032] paid me and- Bucket day.
[time=1034] Bucket day.
[time=1035] What'd you do?
[time=1036] I put up pay, I hold corn, I worked and I worked hard for him on the farm.
[time=1040] And that was probably in what year approximately?
[time=1043] That was probably my junior high of high school, so it's been about 1940, somewhere, '39, somewhere.
[time=1051] Awesome.
[time=1052] Tell him about, I know as a young man you served in the armed forces, tell him what
[time=1058] branch, kind of where you went and then maybe just a memorable story from that experience.
[time=1065] Well, I did hear President Roosevelt's speech concerning the war.
[time=1071] You heard Franklin Delanos?
[time=1072] Yeah, I heard him speak.
[time=1074] Wow.
[time=1075] And in high school we had an assembly together and heard him speak after Japan and Honolulu.
[time=1084] And then I was drafted about two years later, 1943, I was drafted and I enlisted in the
[time=1091] Marine Corps and I served in the Marine Corps for three years.
[time=1095] But I remember one experience I had, we were gearing up to invade Japan.
[time=1102] We would have gone into the invasion of Japan, but when they dropped the bomb, of course, in Japan the war was over and I used to swim in a China Sea and I got an infection in my
[time=1113] year and I went to Okinawa and the doctor said, "Would you like to go home?" And I said, "Yeah, I'd love to go home." He said, "Okay, I'll send you home." I got as far as Guam and the doctor examined me there and he said, "You're not going home." So, here I was all alone.
[time=1128] I just had the clothes that I had on my, on me.
[time=1131] I didn't have any other clothes or anything and I didn't know what to do.
[time=1137] So I tried to find out where my outfit was and they were in Singtel, China.
[time=1143] The outfit that you had left in?
[time=1144] Yeah, they were in China.
[time=1146] Okay.
[time=1147] So, I hitchhiked my way to China.
[time=1150] I got one plane to Okinawa, then I got another plane and landed in Shanghai.
[time=1155] I didn't have any money, the Red Cross gave me ten dollars and then I finally was able
[time=1162] to get back to my outfit in Singtel and I spent six months in China.
[time=1166] It was quite an experience.
[time=1168] Hitchhiked to China to find his outfit.
[time=1172] Not as closed as buddies, amazing.
[time=1176] Well, your first ministry opportunity, your first pastorate, it was there and how much
[time=1185] did you make in your first year of being a pastor?
[time=1189] Well, my first part was in Woodville, Wisconsin and we had two children and I made 35 dollars
[time=1195] a week.
[time=1196] Wow.
[time=1197] Aren't there two churches at one time going on there?
[time=1200] Yeah, I did speak at a Dutch Reformed church.
[time=1203] I would speak there in the morning to 500 about nine o'clock and then come down to my church and speak to 100.
[time=1209] Awesome.
[time=1210] Wow.
[time=1211] So, it was quite a ministry.
[time=1212] I was telling Kelly, the first apartment we ever rented, we paid a dollar a day for the apartment.
[time=1218] We had a kitchen and a bedroom and a little living room and then we shared the bath and
[time=1226] we lived there.
[time=1227] We had an ice box, we had a little burner, we cooked our food on burner.
[time=1232] What are cooked either way?
[time=1234] And that was our beginning.
[time=1235] Yeah, man.
[time=1236] Gasoline, what do you remember about the price of gas?
[time=1239] 15 cents a gallon.
[time=1241] How about a stamp?
[time=1243] Three cents.
[time=1244] Wow.
[time=1245] And a car?
[time=1247] Car about 1500.
[time=1248] Wow.
[time=1249] Well, of course, when I was born, about 400 or 500, yeah.
[time=1254] Here's the deal.
[time=1257] Who in the room, whether we're talking about the trip from Okinawa to China and the hitch
[time=1263] hiking or the price of gas or the price of a car or how much he made is, I mean, who
[time=1269] in the room wants to raise their hand and say, "He's lying."
[time=1275] Anybody?
[time=1277] Who in the room?
[time=1278] There's just an overzealous first grader, don't worry about it.
[time=1285] Who in the room believes him, yeah.
[time=1292] And you believe him, you believe him because he was what?
[time=1297] Say it again.
[time=1299] He was there.
[time=1302] He heard it, saw it, he went through it, touched it.
[time=1308] Here is a reliable source.
[time=1310] And you and I know that as we think about all the stuff that he just said, there comes with that message as he speaks it, a real sense of clarity and a real sense of confidence
[time=1319] that it's true.
[time=1320] Keith, I know how much this book of 1 John means to you.
[time=1323] I know how much our effort to try and help people understand what a follower of Christ
[time=1329] looks like and lives like.
[time=1330] I know that means a lot to you.
[time=1332] Pray for us, which is we continue to jump into this study this morning.
[time=1337] Our Father, we bow on thy presence this morning, thanking thee for the privilege we have of entering this auditorium this morning to hearing the Word of God.
[time=1346] And we thank you so much for the testimony of John who saw thee, who touched thee, who
[time=1354] worked with thee and our Father was under thy teaching, Lord Jesus.
[time=1359] We're grateful for this hour.
[time=1361] Pray that blessing upon Kelly as he ministers to us, fill him with thy Holy Spirit and challenge
[time=1367] our hearts, convict us, for it's needed that our Father, we might serve thee in a great
[time=1373] way because of the ministry of thy Word this morning, we pray in Jesus' wonderful name.
[time=1379] [AMEN - 1 seconds] Thank you.
[time=1382] Keith.
[time=1383] Okay.
[time=1384] So, the doubts and the questions that sometimes you and I have in our humanness, you know, those
[time=1396] get answered, those get addressed in such a powerful way in just these first four verses.
[time=1401] [AMEN] I mean, even already you and I start to feel encouraged all over again.
[time=1406] But now here's the parallel track, here's the second thing I want you to see and sense as we move our way through these first four verses.
[time=1413] Remember last week, remember last week, if you were here, we started this whole thing out by saying that one of the main reasons that John writes, one of the main purposes behind this letter is the fact that he was so very concerned with a false teaching, a
[time=1429] false philosophy that was beginning to, even from within, permeate the church and create
[time=1435] great danger for those that knew the Lord.
[time=1438] John was extremely concerned about this philosophy called, you were here, say it to me, Gnosticism,
[time=1446] there was this philosophy of the day that put a huge priority on the spirit world.
[time=1454] It put a huge priority on all that you knew.
[time=1457] It put a huge priority on knowledge.
[time=1460] It was this elitist type thing that was all about the super spiritual and in doing so,
[time=1466] it negated the physical.
[time=1470] Physical was bad.
[time=1472] Body was bad.
[time=1473] Human form, bad.
[time=1474] It was all bad.
[time=1475] Physical, bad, spirit, good.
[time=1477] It went so far as to then, kind of as a byproduct of that, they begin to chip away at the human
[time=1484] ness and the physicalness of Christ.
[time=1491] Once John catches wind of that, he begins to do what a good shepherd does.
[time=1495] He begins to protect his flock by reminding them of what is true.
[time=1500] I want you to think about this now.
[time=1502] I started this off by asking, does anybody ever really kind of question whether our faith is true, kind of a personal, do you need some encouragement and a reminder?
[time=1512] We all said, yeah, and we read 1 John 1 1 to 4 and we go, wow, that's like just a fresh
[time=1518] wind and thank you, I needed that.
[time=1521] Now, forget so much your personal wandering or worrying and for a moment, now come over here to the context of that day.
[time=1530] Here we have a philosophy permeating a church that was saying that, you know what, this
[time=1536] whole Jesus thing, yeah, it's good in some sense, but don't ever think, you know, the Gnostic saying, don't ever think that it was a physical thing.
[time=1543] Jesus, he was above that, Jesus wasn't physical, Jesus was a phantom spirit, they said.
[time=1551] She got Gnostic saying, he's a phantom spirit, never physical.
[time=1555] Now read 1 John 1 1 to 4 again.
[time=1558] What was from the beginning, what we have heard, you with me?
[time=1562] What we have heard, physical.
[time=1567] What we have looked at, physical, and touched with our hands, physical, concerning the word
[time=1575] of life, Jesus himself, and the life Christ was manifested, made, physical, and we have
[time=1584] seen physical and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father
[time=1591] in what, in spirit and was manifested, made, what, say it, physical to us.
[time=1599] What we have seen, physical and heard, physical, we proclaim to you also so that you too may
[time=1605] have fellowship with us and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus
[time=1612] Christ.
[time=1613] These things, what was from the beginning, the truth about Jesus, these things we write
[time=1620] so that our joy may be made complete.
[time=1623] I love that, I love, I loved opening that up on Monday morning this week and seeing that right out of the gate, the very Gnostic thought and danger we addressed last week, he right
[time=1635] out of the gate goes right after it, to defend and to lift up and to remind of the greatness
[time=1645] of our Lord, the physicalness of Him, the humanity, the incarnation, it's amazing and
[time=1651] I want you to see four things this morning that he says right there, says that John heard
[time=1658] Christ, that he saw Christ, that he gazed, some translations would say gazed upon and
[time=1664] in touch, let's look at those.
[time=1666] Can we do that together, number one he heard Christ, he, John, this reliable source were
[time=1672] reminded that he heard Christ.
[time=1676] Go back to Acts, if you would, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, go to Acts, chapter four
[time=1684] and I just love again, I love how John is so often a part of these stories and so a part
[time=1691] of these instances that we can turn to, this is John as a younger man, now we're back in
[time=1697] Acts as the church is beginning to blossom and grow and face persecution and challenge,
[time=1703] look at Acts four, 18 to 20, I believe this isn't just John, it's Peter, Peter and John
[time=1710] are doing their ministry, they're proclaiming this word, this message that they had heard
[time=1716] and experienced, they bump into some trouble here, Acts, chapter four, verse 18, it says
[time=1723] and when they had summoned them, when they had summoned them, they commanded them not
[time=1729] to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
[time=1735] But Peter and John answered and said to them, "Whether it is right in the side of God to
[time=1741] give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge," four, verse 20, "we cannot stop
[time=1749] speaking about what we have seen and everybody say it, heard, can't do it, we have got to
[time=1758] speak, we have got to respond, we have got to share and pass along that which we have
[time=1764] heard," because what we have heard came from him, came from him, it's something I've seen
[time=1772] again and again my friends, people really aren't interested, people really aren't interested
[time=1778] in nor are they helped much I've learned by my opinion and my thoughts or yours.
[time=1787] People come into this room week after week, people huddle in small groups and living rooms, people meet in restaurant booths, people come week after week and are in desperate need of a word from God.
[time=1801] And when and when that word is delivered by someone who has heard that voice and listened
[time=1808] carefully to that voice, that word, that message is a reliable word, amen?
[time=1816] You know that in the everyday of life, we know that in the spiritual sense that as we, as we're reminded of where it is that John got his word, as we're reminded of where it is John picked up this message, the fact of the matter is he didn't read about it somewhere,
[time=1832] he didn't hear about it at some well, no, he heard it from the Lord and he now passes
[time=1838] on that which he heard.
[time=1841] There's something about a story that gets told by someone who in the telling of the story
[time=1849] you know for sure that they've heard it.
[time=1855] They know what it sounds like.
[time=1856] Let me ask you this, who in the room could today describe in great detail what it sounds
[time=1866] like because you've heard it, who in the room this morning could with great detail communicate
[time=1872] for all of us, I'll get you a mic you can come on up, what it sounds like to be in a condominium
[time=1882] on a second floor at 4.31 in the morning in the middle of a 7.2 earthquake.
[time=1891] Anybody?
[time=1895] Let me tell you because I've been there.
[time=1900] Here's the picture.
[time=1901] You're all pretty imaginative.
[time=1904] So I want you, you've got to close your eyes, close your eyes, but I want you to imagine this.
[time=1908] I want you to imagine like a five story high stairway cement block stairway and just imagine
[time=1918] in your mind the stairway and it's not like out in the open, it's an enclosed straight five story drop cement stairway and it's in one of those, you know it's like it's enclosed.
[time=1929] How am I trying to say this, like in a hospital when you're walking up the stairs and somebody opens the door like 15 stories down, you can hear it because it just echoes, it's just you're in that, you're with me, you're in that stairway, just five stories down, straight cement blocks.
[time=1944] Now at the top of the stairway, just picture 50, picture 50, 50 gallon drums, just all stacked
[time=1956] straight up maybe, maybe you know, maybe five across, you know, ten high, just 50, 50 gallon
[time=1963] drums and inside the 50 gallon drums there's bricks, dishes and glasses, not like seeing
[time=1972] glasses but like drinking glasses and all of those drums and a five story drop down cement
[time=1979] concrete stairs and then just imagine in your mind's eye, now get your ears ready and you're
[time=1985] in that stairway, like you're under the last flight, down at the bottom and then somebody
[time=1993] pushes all 50 of those babies over, you hear it, I mean just think about what that sounds
[time=2000] like, that's, that's what it sounds like and now throw into that, hold on, you got to throw
[time=2007] into that, two bedroom condo, master bedroom, living room, other bedroom, you got to throw
[time=2014] into that, I was in bed, my wife was on the couch, she was sick, we weren't fighting,
[time=2021] my wife's on the couch and our 18 month old little boy is in the far room and now that's
[time=2028] going on and the floor and the floor is shaking three to four feet and you can't stand up
[time=2036] and then what you hear is your wife screaming, screaming, terrified screams from your wife
[time=2045] and then you hear the terrified scream of an 18 month old who you're sure just fell into the center of the earth, now am I lying to you, did you sort of, did you even come, did
[time=2063] you kind of come close to getting a picture of what that might have sounded like, raise your hand, yeah, because I was where, yeah, there, something about that, that when you
[time=2077] just are sharing with others, especially when you read it in here, when you know somebody was there and they say I heard it, something about the validity, the reliability that brings
[time=2088] great clarity, my friends he heard Christ with his own ears and he shares with us what he
[time=2097] heard and what he heard was true, write this down, John not only heard Christ, he saw Christ,
[time=2105] this is awesome, John saw Christ, John saw everything my friends, he saw him, he saw
[time=2112] him live, he saw him converse, he saw him with others, he saw him in difficulty, he saw
[time=2119] him laugh, he saw him sleep, he saw him eat, he saw him arrested, he saw him tried by pilot
[time=2127] in the Sanhedrin, he saw him beaten, saw him walked up that hill, saw him nailed to the cross, John saw him suffer and John watched him die, saw it all, didn't miss anything.
[time=2144] John 19, open your Bibles or turn in your Bibles, to John 19, Matthew Mark Luke John,
[time=2152] John 19, 31, John 19, 31 to 35, here we find in the narrative here in the fourth gospel,
[time=2165] we're picking up here at the conclusion of the crucifixion, then the Jew, and John here,
[time=2171] John, this is John, this isn't first John, now we're in the gospel of John written by the same guy, you know, many years before and he says, then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for the Sabbath was a high day, asked pilot that their legs might be broken and that they might
[time=2191] be taken away.
[time=2193] So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with him, but coming to Jesus when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break
[time=2205] his legs, but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and immediately blood
[time=2211] and water come out and now in the middle of this incredibly detailed description of what he saw, I just love it how John, it's like he just presses pause for a moment from the details and now just speaks to us, a little short apologetic, just a really short little
[time=2228] powerful statement and he says in 35, and he who has seen, has testified, talking about
[time=2238] himself and his testimony, my testimony, me, John, who saw all this, my testimony is what,
[time=2244] say it out loud, and he knows that he is telling the truth so that you also may say it, believe,
[time=2257] for these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, he saw it, you know, there's something
[time=2264] about somebody who's heard it, there's something about somebody who has seen it, you know, it's
[time=2273] just a few weeks ago that a good friend of mine, he and I were in Manhattan, we were
[time=2280] in New York just for a day and in the midst of that day in downtown New York, we on our
[time=2286] way somewhere we hopped in a taxi and I don't know about you, I don't know how often you
[time=2293] get to take a taxi ride in New York, every time I get to, I cherish it, I love talking to those guys, I love finding out about who they are, I love finding where they've come
[time=2304] from, I love hearing their story, you know, if they'll talk, I'll listen, so me and my buddy, we started on this guy and he just starts talking and so as we're going down the road literally and then just kind of going down the road of his life and experience, I don't know how it came up but I, I ended up asking him where he was on 9/11 and what
[time=2325] was a very talkative, jovial guy who was in the midst of a very talkative, jovial conversation,
[time=2333] the moment I said that, it wasn't jovial anymore, the moment I asked, I wish I could just, I
[time=2341] wish I had a video of it, I could just see him from where I was sitting over by the window, the look on his face and the, and the tears that welled up in his eyes and he said to
[time=2352] my buddy and I, well, I was, I was there, he was at the towers when the first plane hit,
[time=2364] and he was right at the tower and saw the first plane go in and then he began to describe
[time=2372] for us what he saw and it was horrific, what he began to do, when it was as if somebody
[time=2382] had just pressed play and we're sitting there listening and just thinking, oh my goodness
[time=2390] and you know, 38 blocks later when we finally got out of the cab, if you were to ask me
[time=2396] what I've asked you already a couple of times this morning, you know, was he lying?
[time=2402] No, no, no, he saw it, he really saw it and in the description you just got a sense that
[time=2413] it was true, John heard Christ, my friends, John saw Christ, now, now watch this, watch
[time=2423] this, John gazed, your translation may not say it but that's, it's translated that way
[time=2429] in other places, back to 1 John, back to 1 John 1, not only did he hear Christ and not only did he see Christ but then it says in 1 John 1 there, it says and what we have seen
[time=2442] with our eyes, what we have looked at, this is a, this is a really, really cool truth,
[time=2451] been waiting all week for you to see this, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, the Greek, in the
[time=2457] Greek the phrase what I've seen and the phrase what I've looked at in the Greek are two really
[time=2464] different things and I don't normally bore you with Greek but you know me, I'll bore you
[time=2470] with Greek if I think you should be bored with it and really in that case it's not boring, it's pretty exciting, right?
[time=2476] So this is some exciting Greek for you, you with me and I'm gonna just reference, I'm
[time=2482] gonna reference somebody who I referenced last week, a guy who's been a great help if you were in second hour last week, I know at one point I said Charles Barkley instead
[time=2492] of William Barkley, believe me, my voicemail and inbox were filled by good friends who
[time=2498] have had a heyday with me since, they didn't know Charles Barkley was a theologian but it's
[time=2506] William Barkley and he is a theologian and an amazing mind and a guy who's done enormous
[time=2512] study on this and I wanna just read this to you, he says that he has gazed on Christ,
[time=2519] what then is the difference, watch this, between seeing Christ and gazing upon him, in the
[time=2527] Greek the verb for it to see is Horan, you can write it down, H-O-R-A-N, Horan, it's the
[time=2533] Greek word for it to see and it means simply to see with physical sight, you're with me,
[time=2540] I see Gary sitting right there, the lights are on, light exposes things, the eye focus in there's Gary, there's my family, there's the clock and it's actually getting late so I'm gonna keep going here, you're with me, we just look, we identify, we see, boom, Horan
[time=2556] I see, I just saw Gary my family and the clock, Horan, the verb for to gaze is not Horan, where
[time=2568] he says I've looked at, he uses the verb fayestai, T-H-E-A, S-T-H-I-A-I, fayestai, the verb for to gaze
[time=2579] is fayestai and it means to gaze at someone or something until something has been grasped
[time=2588] of the significance of that person or thing, it means to really, really, really look at
[time=2597] something and in the really, really, really looking to gain insight and to gain clarity
[time=2603] and to take in the full scope of all that's there in that person or thing, Luke 7, you
[time=2611] can write this down, Luke 724, it's the verb used where it says, where Jesus says, what did you go out into the wilderness to see when Jesus is speaking to the crowds about
[time=2622] John the Baptist, he asked them, what did you go out into the wilderness to see and he uses the word fayestai and in that word he describes how the crowds flocked out to
[time=2635] gaze at John the Baptist and wonder who and what this man might be, this prophet, this
[time=2643] strange John the Baptist, they would go to fayestai to gaze at him, we beheld, speaking
[time=2650] of Jesus in the beginning of his gospel, John himself at the beginning of the book of John 1, he says, we beheld his glory, we saw his glory, the verb used there is fayestai, not
[time=2663] haran and the idea is not that of a passing glance but of a steadfast searching gaze which
[time=2672] seeks to discover something of the mystery of Christ, my friends John says that not only
[time=2679] did he see Christ, he fayestai Christ, he gazed upon him, he looked deeply into to gain a
[time=2689] clear picture, speaking of New York, I think my son Russell was at maybe 12, 13 years old
[time=2700] when we sent him off on his first mission strip and it was to New York City with our student ministry crew from Blackhawk and it was an amazing week or so and we were grateful
[time=2712] to get him back and there was a night there upon his return where he sat with his mom and I at the table in the dining room and while he gave us details of the trip it was
[time=2723] an amazing thing to experience him as he began to communicate and relay to us what it was
[time=2729] like for him to be at ground zero and when he went four years ago that was all still
[time=2735] pretty fresh and I'll never forget that night sitting there with him as he just began to
[time=2745] talk about what he saw and what it was like and how it was set up and what was really
[time=2751] amazing was that the picture he painted for us at the age of 12, 13 years of age, it wasn't
[time=2757] too long after that but on another occasion, Kebra and I had a chance to go for the first time and I'll never forget walking up to and if you've been there I'll never forget walking up to the fence, to the cyclone fence there and I'll never forget walking up and
[time=2773] beginning to take it all in and it looked familiar because a 13 year old had described
[time=2782] for me with great detail and here's the thing the student ministry team when they took the
[time=2788] kids down there, they didn't take them down there for ten minutes did they? No they took them down there for a couple hours and those kids fazed died, that scene, they gazed on
[time=2802] it and they took it in and here he was explaining to me and there I was seeing it for the first
[time=2810] time and it being exactly like he had said, John fazed died, Christ, gazed upon him and
[time=2818] now shares with us to comfort our doubts and to silence the Gnostics, the truth about
[time=2826] Jesus and here's your last one, John touched, he heard Christ, he saw Christ, he went beyond
[time=2832] seeing him and he gazed upon him, now look at this, this is almost like the climactic like here you go take this and this kind of wraps it up, John touched Christ, he touched
[time=2844] Christ and don't forget he didn't just touch him, he didn't just touch him on the road
[time=2850] in between towns as they traveled, he did, he touched him while they ate and he touched
[time=2856] him while they traveled and he touched him as they lived and shared life together, he did that for a couple, two, three years but not but but he also touched him after he had
[time=2871] been arrested and crucified and died and was put into the tomb and then defeated death
[time=2878] and rose again, John touched the resurrected Christ and that my friends is powerful, like
[time=2886] Luke 24, I love this, Luke 24 is in existence, this is our Lord speaking, this is our Lord
[time=2893] speaking and he says see my hands, see here's the thing I believe with all my heart, that the Lord knew, that Christ himself knew how important it would be for those in that day
[time=2902] and for those of us today, I think he realized how important it would be that they touch him
[time=2910] and that they feel and sense with their own hands the physicalness and the reality of
[time=2917] him, that he wasn't a phantom spirit, look what he says, I love this, see my hands, here's
[time=2924] his Jesus as he now appears to his guys there, the disciples in the room after he has risen
[time=2931] from the dead, see my hands and my feet, that it is I myself touch me and see for a spirit,
[time=2940] take that Gnostics, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.
[time=2950] John touched a resurrected Christ, so I stayed here this morning, believe in the resurrection,
[time=2957] that's true, it happened but believe as well what the false teachers were trying to refute
[time=2966] and again I refer to William Barkley, here John is thinking of those, when he says I've
[time=2973] touched him, John is thinking of those called the Gnostics who were so spiritually minded that they insisted that Jesus never at any time had a flesh and blood body but was only
[time=2984] a phantom spirit in human form, they refused to believe that God could ever soil himself,
[time=2994] which is exactly what he wanted, it's what he did, he refused to believe that God could
[time=3001] ever soil himself by taking human flesh and blood upon himself, John here insists that
[time=3008] Jesus that the Jesus he had known was in truth a man amongst men, he felt there was nothing
[time=3016] in all the world more dangerous than to doubt that Jesus was fully man.
[time=3025] I told you last week that this series was about a very intentional and heartfelt effort
[time=3033] on our part to just help this entire family and those of you who are viewing at home and
[time=3040] those of you listening online, our hope here in the days to come is to more and more so
[time=3046] become a place that's filled with Christ followers, disciples, people who are really
[time=3054] genuinely given and very serious about their efforts with God's help to follow and honor
[time=3060] him, we want to try and help move people from attending, which isn't bad, to following.
[time=3067] And this morning I just want you to be so encouraged that this truth that we see here my friends, this followers of Christ can be confident of this, amen?
[time=3079] Followers of Christ, follow and give themselves to a faith that is as legitimate and reliable
[time=3085] and as valid as the day is long, I'm telling you my friends, these guys were there, they heard it, they saw it, they gazed upon it, they touched it and it provides for you and
[time=3098] I great confidence.
[time=3098] I want to say this to you before I let you go, John already and just the study of first
[time=3105] John in these first two weeks, even in some of the things that I've said, we've already
[time=3111] in two weeks made a great deal about, we've made it a really big deal, this whole Christ was human thing, the incarnation, the physicalness of our Lord and how important it would be
[time=3124] for you and I to never ever let that get theologically or doctrinally dinged.
[time=3129] We always want to hold on to that, well it dawns on me this morning, when I'm driving in, why, you know, it's just good to ask you that, some of you in the room know why it's
[time=3141] so important that we proclaim and hold up the human side, yes he was divine, yes Jesus
[time=3149] was 100% God, but he was also, though the Gnostics didn't like it and John felt that
[time=3155] we need to defend it, he was 100% man, he really did take on human flesh and human form.
[time=3164] Why is that so important?
[time=3167] Answer that, right now in your mind.
[time=3173] How are you answering that, you know, I want to, I want to try and just make sure that we at least address that, I don't want to just stand here for two weeks and say, boy, it's really important that we never lose sight of the fact that he was human without making sure that at least we have some semblance of understanding why that's so important.
[time=3190] Anybody?
[time=3192] Think about this, Hebrews 4, I think there's a, I think there, when we can even come back to this, I think there are several really important things to say right there that the Scripture teaches, here's one for you, I want you to just stand right where you are quietly, don't leave, and I want you to look at the screen with me.
[time=3209] Why is it so important that we never lose sight of the humanness of our Lord?
[time=3213] That's what it says in Hebrews 4, 14, 15, therefore, since we have a great high priest
[time=3219] who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
[time=3226] Look at this in verse 15, it says, "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize
[time=3233] with our weakness, but one who has been, say it, tempted in how many things, say it,
[time=3242] all things as we are, yet without sin."
[time=3249] Here's one, here's one, very important point here, my friends.
[time=3252] How can he be, how can he be your personal?
[time=3257] You hear me say it all the time, you hear us say it all the time, he's our personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3264] We talk about him being our personal shepherd, the one who knows you and the one who cares for you, the one who's able to identify, well, how could he be a personal shepherd, how could
[time=3275] he be our personal Lord and Savior, how could he ever identify with everything you face
[time=3282] and everything I encounter if he wasn't human, he couldn't, but he was, and you and I don't
[time=3292] ever want to let go of that great truth, that in his willingness to soil himself with humanity,
[time=3300] he takes on the very form of that which he came to redeem, amen?
[time=3306] And that's what makes redemption, and that's what makes salvation so glorious.
[time=3313] And that's what makes him so amazing, he didn't sit up here in the clouds and throw
[time=3319] some magic thing down here, you know, and try and pull something off without ever entering in.
[time=3324] No, he's the one who entered in completely.
[time=3327] And we need to remember that and hold on to that, great, great truth.
[time=3330] Hey, we're going to keep making our way through this great book in the weeks to come month of October, we're going to take a very, very exciting break.
[time=3340] We've got some things to share with you as a family that are significant as it relates to the life and the future of this ministry, I cannot wait to take you through it.
[time=3351] In the month of October, I hope you'll be here.
[time=3353] We've got some very, very important things to talk with you about, and that'll begin the first Sunday in October, but come back next week, we're going to just move on through the passage here in 1 John, can't wait to have you here, bring some friends, and again, if you need someone to pray with you this morning about anything, if you'd like somebody to pray with you this morning about any of this that we've talked about, any need in your life, we'll have elders down here in the front who would be happy to meet with you.
[time=3380] Let me pray for us and we'll go.
[time=3382] God, thanks for the morning, and thank you.
[time=3384] We mean it for the privilege that is ours to be able to be here to make much of you in our worship, God to make much of you in our study, God to be amazed by you again as we
[time=3395] think about the great validity and the great reliability of the truth, and the ones who
[time=3402] you used, God, to communicate it, and we're thankful for John today, thankful that he late in his life was willing to recall all that he had seen and all that he had heard
[time=3415] and what he had touched, God, to comfort us and to remind us that this faith isn't about folklore, this faith isn't about opinion, this faith isn't just a good story, no, our faith is based upon the truth of what really transpired, of who really was, and we knew
[time=3432] that is the Christ, our Lord and Savior.
[time=3435] Thank you, Father, for this reminder, and I pray, God, that it would bring great confidence and I pray, God, that it would bring great assurance, and if there are those in the room this morning that really don't know you, if there are those here who haven't surrendered,
[time=3450] their heart and life to you, God, I pray that they could know the confidence and the joy
[time=3456] that John spoke about, I pray that their joy could finally be complete in coming to know you, and God, I pray that the validity and the reliability of this truth would move them
[time=3468] even closer to accepting you fully and devoting themselves to you completely.
[time=3474] God, if we can help in that, I pray that they would ask.
[time=3478] Thank you for the morning, God, we love you, and we'll look forward to being together again soon.
[time=3482] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3508] [MUSIC]
