[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age.
[time=49] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=74] You lay on the land of sober God, the land of sober God, the land of sober God, we are
[time=110] the Son has set you free, if the Son has set me free, then I am free, I am free, indeed,
[time=126] and nothing can take that from me when I am free, forever free.
[time=134] You lay on the land of sober God, the land of sober God, the land of sober God, the land
[time=165] land of sober God, the land of sober God, the land of sober God, the land of sober God,
[time=666] is an awesome God.
[time=678] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[time=683] He was with God in the beginning.
[time=685] Through Him all things were made, without Him nothing was made that has been made.
[time=690] In Him was life, and that life was the light of men.
[time=694] The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness is not understood.
[time=698] The light shines in the darkness and shines.
[time=703] The mind collapse claims three more workers as they struggle to rescue the six trap miners.
[time=709] And shines.
[time=710] A newborn infant has found alive in a bathroom.
[time=712] The mother is in custody, and the child is in foster care.
[time=716] Another campus school shooting claimed seven, and the gunman took his own life.
[time=720] And shines.
[time=721] Four more soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb.
[time=724] This brings a total up to fourteen this week alone.
[time=727] This is the second hurricane to hit the Florida coast this season.
[time=731] Property damage is estimated in the millions in this small resort town alone.
[time=734] And shines.
[time=736] Where is this shining light?
[time=738] God is light, in Him there is no darkness.
[time=741] Where today is our beacon of truth?
[time=743] I am writing to you a new command.
[time=745] Its truth is found in Him and you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
[time=752] Where today is our instrument of peace?
[time=754] Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness.
[time=759] We're in the midst of all this tragedy.
[time=761] We're in the midst of sin and rebellion.
[time=763] Everyone who continues to sin breaks the law.
[time=767] In fact sin is lawlessness.
[time=770] No one who lives in Him keeps on sinning.
[time=773] This world is divided between light and darkness.
[time=778] We should walk in the light as He is in the light.
[time=781] Into obedience or sin.
[time=783] Dear children, I write to you so that you will not sin.
[time=786] Loving the Father or loving the world.
[time=789] Do not love the world or anything in the world.
[time=792] Christ or the evil one.
[time=794] Who is a liar?
[time=795] It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=799] Having life or not having life.
[time=802] This is what He has promised us, eternal life.
[time=805] Believing truth or believing lies.
[time=808] No lie comes from the truth.
[time=811] Being children of God or being children of Satan.
[time=814] This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are.
[time=818] No one who lives in Him keeps on sinning.
[time=823] True teaching or false teaching.
[time=827] Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray.
[time=830] Showing love or showing hatred.
[time=833] This is how we know what love is, that Jesus Christ laid down His life for us.
[time=840] And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
[time=844] This world is divided.
[time=847] He loved us first.
[time=848] The Word of God lives in us.
[time=851] We are called the children of God.
[time=853] We believe God.
[time=856] In Him we have eternal life.
[time=858] We have overcome the evil one.
[time=860] We have known and loved the Father.
[time=862] Our sins have been forgiven on account of His name.
[time=864] And He is the light.
[time=867] The light shines in the darkness.
[time=869] And shines.
[time=876] We are going to jump in here on where you are walking.
[time=884] Where you are living.
[time=886] In darkness or in the light and my buddy Mitch had an experience in the dark that he's going
[time=892] to tell you about here as we start in this morning.
[time=895] It was about six years ago and I had a friend in from out of town.
[time=899] And he had a flight later that day so we wanted to get started early.
[time=902] So I was leaving my home somewhere between five and five thirty.
[time=906] It was November and it was still dark in the morning than in November.
[time=910] And in my home on one end is my bedroom and then on the other end is my garage where my car is and I have to walk through a hallway that passes through our family room where there's four columns, two pairs, two here, go down the hallway and then two down there
[time=927] and then exit out through the kitchen.
[time=929] So I come to the beginning of that walk and it's dark.
[time=936] And I have an opportunity to turn on the light.
[time=941] And I didn't want to turn on the light because I like my light switches up when they're on
[time=948] and down when they're off.
[time=950] And this one was it was just was bad that was anybody else like that?
[time=954] Oh praise the Lord.
[time=956] People actually raise their hand.
[time=958] Yeah.
[time=959] Do that again.
[time=960] Raise your hand if you like that.
[time=962] Raise them up high.
[time=965] Bunch of sickos.
[time=966] Look at those with their hands down.
[time=969] Keep the switch.
[time=972] I know it's hard for you to relate.
[time=974] So I go.
[time=976] I go and I stick my hand out and I feel the fourth column and bam.
[time=982] It was the third column.
[time=984] Now the columns are square.
[time=986] So I it's just like the corner there just went bhish.
[time=993] And what do you think the first thing I did was?
[time=1002] Go ahead.
[time=1004] You check to see if the wood was chipped.
[time=1006] Yes I did.
[time=1007] Yeah.
[time=1008] Who else would do that?
[time=1009] Raise your hand.
[time=1010] Oh praise the Lord.
[time=1012] I turn on the light.
[time=1016] I looked in the mirror and I couldn't believe what I saw.
[time=1018] I had this red line that I thought maybe I'd cracked my whole head open, came down here that ended up being a scratch.
[time=1024] And then I saw that it was bleeding profusely right here.
[time=1029] And so I called the Calamora hospital, told him who I was.
[time=1032] I'd be coming in to be stitched up, called my friend from out of town, told him what had happened.
[time=1038] He laughed.
[time=1039] And I called the most comforting Pastor Bird and told him what had happened because
[time=1045] we're going to meet together and he laughed.
[time=1047] So a couple of things went through my mind.
[time=1053] Most people get a cut on their head and you never get to see it because the scar is always covered by hair.
[time=1059] I laughed because I knew now for years we get to see that scar because there was nothing
[time=1066] to cover it.
[time=1067] Bill is that fair?
[time=1068] I don't know if that's fair.
[time=1070] Oh that's a shame.
[time=1072] Okay so every morning I got the scar to remind me and then I got friends to remind me too.
[time=1076] I thought of a couple things.
[time=1079] Number one was I had the opportunity before my walk to walk in the light.
[time=1087] And it's funny how I had to get knocked around a little bit before I was willing to humble myself and turn on that light switch.
[time=1094] The second is this, darkness is darkest when we pretend there's no darkness at all.
[time=1107] But darkness is darkest when we pretend that there really is no darkness at all.
[time=1115] And it might surprise you that's really what the context we believe a first John is here
[time=1122] today is not necessarily a licentious kind of darkness but it's more of a legalistic
[time=1129] kind of darkness.
[time=1130] Because you see in Gnosticism as Kelly has talked about it was about enlightenment.
[time=1136] If I could just gain more knowledge then I would be closer to God.
[time=1141] And that Gnosticism wasn't just like this outside pagan influence.
[time=1146] It was a cultural influence that influenced the early Christians.
[time=1150] And so early Christians were just saying if I would just know more then I'll be closer to God.
[time=1156] If I just have more mental ascent then I'll be closer to God.
[time=1161] So what we see in this first part of 1 John 1 5 2 2 are three self righteous proclamations,
[time=1172] three self righteous proclamations.
[time=1174] And they're tipped off by three pairs of if statements, if statements.
[time=1181] In each pair the first if statement is negative, the second if statement is positive.
[time=1187] We'll show you what that means.
[time=1188] So there's three pairs.
[time=1189] Here you might want to write this down are the three self righteous proclamations of walking in darkness.
[time=1195] And it is the danger.
[time=1196] It is the risk of anyone who takes his or her faith seriously is what we're reading
[time=1202] here today.
[time=1203] And just like Gnosticism influenced the early Christians 2000 years ago we have postmodernism
[time=1210] today.
[time=1211] This idea that I should be open to anything and that affects us as Christians here.
[time=1216] So it's very similar 2000 years not a whole lot has changed.
[time=1220] The first self righteous proclamation of walking in darkness is saying, you might write down, we have fellowship with him.
[time=1227] We have fellowship with him.
[time=1228] We kind of brag about the knowledge earning us to God.
[time=1232] We have fellowship with him and John writes yet walk in darkness.
[time=1237] So these are probably saying in the early church people are saying, well we have fellowship with him and John says yet walk in darkness.
[time=1243] That's a first self proclamation self righteous proclamation.
[time=1246] The second one is if we say we do not have sin.
[time=1252] We do not have sin.
[time=1253] This would be a continued principle of sin in my life that it rules over me.
[time=1260] Well we don't have that.
[time=1262] We don't have sin.
[time=1264] Knowledge has taken us to God.
[time=1268] And then the third one is it's a little tweak on the word sin.
[time=1272] And that is when we say we, and this is an indication that we might be this today, we have not sinned.
[time=1277] And this is probably referring to a specific sin in my life.
[time=1281] So if I got this thing going on, the self righteousness thing going on, the darkest darkness is pretending there's no darkness at all.
[time=1288] I have this self righteous thing going on in my life.
[time=1291] Then I'll probably brag about my connection with God, boast about it.
[time=1295] I'll probably say well I don't have sin, you know, and then any specific sin, I'm going
[time=1302] to be very, very difficult to have anything like that addressed in my life.
[time=1308] Today we're just going to focus on the first one.
[time=1312] If we say we have fellowship with him yet walk in darkness, and so the question really that I think we're addressing today is are we really walking in the light, really?
[time=1325] Are we really walking in the light?
[time=1330] And how do we know?
[time=1332] And we think that's so important.
[time=1335] We think this time together here is so very important.
[time=1339] We think this passage and the truth that God has for us here today is so very important because if we asked you seriously, like genuinely here, not flippantly, if we said everybody
[time=1358] in the room who would say that you have fellowship with him, raise your hand, and if you really
[time=1368] go ahead and if you really thought that, yeah go ahead, if you're really in your heart believe that, great, and if you don't and you're on that journey and you're still trying to think that through, great job for keeping your hand down, and again know how thankful we are, what a privilege it is for us to get to journey down this road together, but the thing is so many of us are going to raise our hands, and if you've been reading John, we've asked you to read through it with us, many of you are, and if you haven't then you can start.
[time=1395] It's a great read, it's a very direct read, at times very confrontational, extremely clear.
[time=1404] John had to be, we talked about that in week one, he had to be clear with what was going on in the church, and so what I'm saying is this, this is so important for us because if we're going to raise our hands and say we have fellowship with him, what the scriptures teach is that there are some things that will come with that.
[time=1420] There is a lifestyle that will come with that, there is a thinking that will accompany that, there is decision making, and there is heart condition that comes with that.
[time=1433] And if we're going to raise our hands then I think it'd be important, it'd be incumbent upon you and I to make sure we understand what that's supposed to look like, not just this,
[time=1442] but this lived out.
[time=1445] You're with me?
[time=1447] So very important, and as we start in here this morning I just want you to, I want you to write this down, I want you to write down, walking in the light, walking in the light,
[time=1458] and the first thing we want to look at in verse five is that God is light, but let's just in honor of God's word, let's just stand and can we read 1 John 1, 5 to 7, 1 John 1,
[time=1470] 5 to 7, walking in the light.
[time=1474] Here you go, this is the message, John writes, this is the message we have heard from him,
[time=1481] so important to stop right there just for a moment, so important that you catch that, so important that we see that right there.
[time=1488] Again, at a time when in that culture there were so many people, and this was happening from within the church, remember, Gnosticism had started to take root, and in a time, in a day when there were so many people saying, hey, this is what I think, when there were so many people who had gotten so smart, when there were so many people who had become so elite in their knowledge, when all the perspectives and all the opinions were flying, it was so
[time=1512] important for John to say, this is the message we have heard from who, him, and announced
[time=1520] to you that God is, everybody say it, right, and in him there is no what, say it, at all.
[time=1529] If we say verse six, if we say, hands raised, right, if we say that we have fellowship with
[time=1535] him, and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth, but if we walk
[time=1542] in the light, as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the
[time=1550] blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
[time=1557] Father God, we stand here this morning with great expectancy and great hope in our hearts,
[time=1563] God, we come before you, wanting the Word of God and the Spirit of God to move within
[time=1569] us.
[time=1570] Father, we realize that the Scriptures are so very powerful, and they have the capacity to penetrate deep into our thinking, deep into our souls, deep into the very core of
[time=1582] who we are, and at the very core of who we are this morning, God, I know that there are many in the room that need a touch from you, they need direction from what is true, God,
[time=1593] we need reminders from your living Word, God, we need help, we need encouragement.
[time=1600] So Father God, we come before you asking that you would and your Spirit would, and your Word would bring those very things to our lives and to our hearts and our souls, and
[time=1609] we'll thank you for it, and all the people agreed and said, amen, you can be seated.
[time=1615] Walking in the light, this discussion this morning begins with a central truth, my friends, and that central truth repeated and seen all throughout Scripture is that God is light.
[time=1626] Write it down, God is light, it is a phenomenal picture.
[time=1631] All through the Scriptures, we see light and darkness used as powerful symbols used oftentimes
[time=1639] by God to describe a number of different truths and a number of different arenas.
[time=1644] We see light versus darkness in the, we see God using it in Scriptures intellectually,
[time=1650] if you will, as far as how the light and darkness affect cognitively our minds and our choices,
[time=1656] the presence of light and darkness from an intellectual perspective.
[time=1660] You can write down Psalm 119-105, Psalm 119-105, many of you know the verse, others if you
[time=1667] may not, it says your Word is a lamp, you see that?
[time=1671] Your Word is a lamp to my feet.
[time=1673] Your Word is a light unto my path, intellectually, light there being used in a way to show decision
[time=1682] making, direction, Proverbs 6, I believe, Proverbs 6, 23, for the commandment, the Word
[time=1688] of God, for the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching intellectually, thinking things
[time=1695] through, giving direction intellectually, the teaching is light and reproofs for discipline are the way of life.
[time=1703] We see light and darkness used throughout the Scriptures.
[time=1706] We see it used on a national level in terms of nations that follow the light and nations
[time=1712] that follow the darkness.
[time=1714] We see it used in ethical discussions and decisions, but most importantly for our discussion today,
[time=1722] we see it used, and we want to point this out to you, most often it's used on the moral front, in the moral discussion, light and darkness, light always referring to holiness, light
[time=1735] always referring to the purity, not only of God, but the holiness and the purity that
[time=1741] God calls you and I to, and darkness, again in the moral context, always referring to
[time=1748] one's sin or moral wrongdoing.
[time=1752] First Thessalonians 5, first Thessalonians 5, just gives us a real clear, I think at the
[time=1759] same time it gives us a very clear and deep insight into this great truth, and it also
[time=1765] gives us a very practical, very right there, cookie on the bottom shelf, easy to get to
[time=1771] truth that I want to make sure you see, first Thessalonians 5, verses 4 to 7, it says actually
[time=1780] back in verse 3, it says, while they are saying peace and safety, then destruction will come
[time=1786] upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child and they will not escape,
[time=1792] but you, now he turns and speaks to believers, those who have raised their hands, right?
[time=1798] Those who say they have fellowship with him, but you brethren, you are not in darkness
[time=1804] that the day would overtake you like a thief, for you are all sons of light and sons of
[time=1811] day, we are not of night, nor of darkness, so then let us not sleep as others do, but
[time=1817] let us be alert and sober, for those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those
[time=1826] who watch this, those who get drunk, get drunk at night, I just want you to see in that,
[time=1838] and I just want you, most of you just kind of get it as we read it, but I want to just remind you that while I think there is some deep and significant meaning here on the bigger light and darkness front, the fact of the matter is that so much of our sin, so much of mind, so much of yours, so much of the sin that we are even tempted to can so many times
[time=1859] take place when the lights are what?
[time=1863] Off.
[time=1864] It is just a practical thing that I would just offer to you this morning to be so very mindful
[time=1871] of and to be so very careful with, and I am not just saying this to kids.
[time=1877] I would say it to young people, keep the lights on, but I would say it to everybody.
[time=1886] And I know there are sins that take place in the right of day.
[time=1890] I know that sometimes the sin pattern gets to a point where it doesn't matter where you are, what time of day it is or if the lights are on or off.
[time=1899] I would just at a very practical level just remind you that so many times the enemy tries
[time=1905] to get you and so many times the enemy tries to reach me with this notion that what is
[time=1911] in the darkness will stay hidden and you and I know it won't.
[time=1916] Keep the lights on.
[time=1917] What do you think about when you read through that passage?
[time=1921] Well, I see how it goes on.
[time=1924] See the problem, the risk is of anyone who takes his faith seriously is that we'll look
[time=1930] at enlightenment, our own pursuit of knowledge, mental assent as the light, and we'll trust
[time=1937] in that and we'll walk in darkness, whereas John's making a point that God, the personal
[time=1944] God of the universe in Christ, he is the light.
[time=1949] It's a relationship, not religion.
[time=1951] So look how Paul goes on in 1 Thessalonians 5 with verse 8.
[time=1955] It says, "But since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation, for God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, through Christ who died
[time=1970] for us so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with him and therefore encourage one another and build up another just as you are doing with that." It all goes back to a relationship that's lived out with the personal God of the universe
[time=1984] in Christ.
[time=1985] He is the light, not my own enlightenment.
[time=1988] God has light, God has light, and bouncing off what Mitch just said, I wrote this down this week.
[time=1993] The Gnostics claimed to be of the light, remember?
[time=1997] But their problem was they thought enlightened, they thought enlightened meant knowing more,
[time=2003] elite knowledge, upper echelon, right, super spiritual.
[time=2007] What Mitch and I would want to make sure you understand this morning, what we want to make sure you're reminded of is that there is an enormous difference between knowing more
[time=2017] about him and knowing him.
[time=2021] There are a lot of people who can know a lot about him and not what?
[time=2025] Not know him.
[time=2028] Huge difference.
[time=2029] It's not about the prideful pursuit of knowledge, it's about the humble pursuit of God.
[time=2037] And in that endeavor, one finds and one experiences real light.
[time=2044] Intimacy with God brings right that down.
[time=2047] Intimacy with God brings more light, not knowledge.
[time=2051] More knowledge doesn't necessarily bring more light.
[time=2055] Intimacy with God brings more light.
[time=2059] Light to what you might ask, well, let us answer that for you, our walk.
[time=2064] And that's what this is about, right back to the text.
[time=2066] It says, 1 John chapter 1 verse 5, you see it there, this is the message we have heard
[time=2076] from him and announced to you that God is light and in him there is no darkness.
[time=2080] Verse 6, if we say we have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness.
[time=2087] This is about our walk.
[time=2088] Now, it's important, Mitchell and I, we were talking about this, it's important here in our study of 1 John, I think that we mentioned this.
[time=2094] I've already gotten, you know, cards and letters, as they say.
[time=2097] I've already gotten phone calls, I've already had discussions with people in my own family about the, what seems like the severity of 1 John or the, the, the, the tension that
[time=2110] it brings.
[time=2111] And here's, here's what I mean.
[time=2112] Just look, look with me at that verse I just read.
[time=2114] If you, if you take this kind of just from an English literal perspective, if we say
[time=2120] we have fellowship with him, okay, just for the illustration here, raise your hand again.
[time=2126] Here's how it gets complicated.
[time=2127] Raise your hand.
[time=2128] If you say you have fellowship with him.
[time=2129] So here we are, all of us with our hands up, and then the next line says then, yet walk
[time=2135] in darkness.
[time=2136] Okay, hands down.
[time=2137] Anybody who's ever walked in darkness, anybody who walked in darkness, send this week.
[time=2144] Raise your hand.
[time=2146] If you walked in darkness, if you say you have fellowship with him and walked in darkness, you're a liar and you do not practice the truth.
[time=2154] All of a sudden people are going, well, wait a minute.
[time=2158] I thought I was a believer.
[time=2160] Now I'm a liar and I don't practice the truth.
[time=2163] Very important as we begin to study this book that you understand what's meant by the phrase,
[time=2169] the terminology walk.
[time=2172] When it talks about how you walk or what you do, this is not talking about tit for tat.
[time=2177] This is not singular, everyday occurrence stuff.
[time=2181] This is talking about the pattern of your life.
[time=2188] What John is saying is that as he mentions your walk, what he's saying is that if your walk, the pattern of your life is your life characterized by ongoing, progressive, hard-hearted,
[time=2203] unrepentant, it's the pattern of your life, sin.
[time=2209] If you raise your hand and say you have fellowship with him, the scriptures are teaching here that if the ongoing, pretty much uninterrupted pattern of your life and condition of your
[time=2221] heart, if it is just kind of forward and up to the right, you know, just sin, sin, sin.
[time=2228] That's the pattern.
[time=2229] It's kind of how I do it.
[time=2230] It's who I am, pretty unrepentant, pretty hard-hearted.
[time=2235] He says, you're a liar.
[time=2238] Put your hand down.
[time=2240] He says, because you don't practice the truth.
[time=2244] However, the pattern of your life, of course there's going to be sin.
[time=2250] Anybody who says there's not me, first John 1-9, if we confess our what?
[time=2255] So John knew there was going to be what?
[time=2258] Sin.
[time=2259] If the pattern of your life is sin, you all raised your hand on sin this week, right?
[time=2265] The pattern of your life is sin, confession, repentance.
[time=2272] Move back toward what's right, sin, confession, repentance.
[time=2282] It's like this, the graph's not, you with me, the graph's like boom and then it's back up and then it's down and it's back up.
[time=2289] A lot of you don't like that, do you?
[time=2291] I don't like it, but that's life in a fallen world as we move toward a day when all that's
[time=2297] going to be gone, but that's, we want to see, you'd want to see a pattern of sin and confession
[time=2304] and repentance.
[time=2305] That means you're growing.
[time=2306] He says, you're a liar.
[time=2308] If you raise your hand and your walk indicates nothing but hard-hearted patterns of sin.
[time=2315] False teachers proclaimed to walk in the light, but as Mitch mentioned earlier, their proclamation
[time=2322] of having no sin left them in the dark.
[time=2327] Walking in darkness is a lie, write it down, that's the second idea.
[time=2331] Walking in darkness is a lie and it's the first of the first pair of the if statement
[time=2338] that tips us off to us of what people must have been saying.
[time=2341] If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet walk pattern of our lives in the darkness,
[time=2349] we lie and do not practice the truth and the deepest darkness is pretending there is no
[time=2356] darkness at all.
[time=2357] The deepest darkness is my own self-righteousness, my own trusting in my own enlightenment.
[time=2366] And so what was going on is when we walk in darkness, that's a lie.
[time=2369] We claim to have fellowship with God but walk or live in darkness.
[time=2374] So many back then, 2,000 years ago, were redefining righteousness as religion and two things would
[time=2381] happen.
[time=2382] You might want to jot these down because they tie into the next idea, the point three.
[time=2386] They removed their need for forgiveness, number one, they would remove their need for forgiveness
[time=2392] and number two, they would separate themselves from others, even other believers, remove
[time=2399] their need for forgiveness and then remove themselves from others, separate themselves
[time=2405] from others.
[time=2406] You know, it's the same potential for us today.
[time=2410] The more we know, not experienced necessarily, but the more we have mental assent, the danger
[time=2416] is that we trust in our own light.
[time=2420] And the farther we go in a relationship with God, the more that there's a risk, the more we go in study of the Bible, there's this risk that will operate in religion, will operate
[time=2432] in the deepest darkness, which is pretending there's no darkness at all.
[time=2435] And we say, well, look at me, I earned that, I earned this from God, I earned this forgiveness, it's all about me, and it's the danger is to be.
[time=2445] And then separating ourselves, be this ABF or that ABF, you know, I need to be with these
[time=2452] people or be in that small group, or I go to a Christian school, or I hang out with girls
[time=2460] who don't get pregnant in high school.
[time=2462] And there's just this danger of separating ourselves from other believers who have sins that we think, whoa, that's not where I am.
[time=2471] And so that's what was going on, and it's the same thing that goes on today.
[time=2474] It's interesting the Apostle Paul addresses this, it's in 1 Corinthians 8, 1, and he says, it says now about food sacrifice to idols, we know that we all possess knowledge.
[time=2485] Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
[time=2489] Knowledge puffs up, and he asks, he talks about having an arrogant heart.
[time=2493] So there's this arrogance that comes with this mental ascent, but with love, I want to build
[time=2499] up others, encourage one another, as Paul also said in 1 Thessalonians 5 that Kelly read.
[time=2505] See, the Pharisees, or the leaders of the Jewish people, were walking in darkness, they were
[time=2511] walking in their own self-righteousness, their own religion, they were not flipping the switch to God or especially Christ, but they thought they were.
[time=2519] So look what Paul wrote in Romans 10, this is verses 1 through 4, this is so interesting.
[time=2524] "Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.
[time=2530] For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge and experience and intimacy with God.
[time=2540] Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and saw it so established their own, are you with me there?
[time=2546] They established their own righteousness, they did not submit to God's righteousness."
[time=2552] Verse 4, Christ is the end of the law, Christ is a lie.
[time=2557] So there may be righteousness for everyone who believes, who will humble their hearts,
[time=2563] their mind will, emotion, spirit and flip that switch and humble their hearts to Christ.
[time=2569] Because God is light, Christ is light, it's a person, it's not an idea that I get in mental
[time=2576] ascent and growing in knowledge and the risk is that I will build a righteousness of my own.
[time=2582] I will trust in my own light before I walk down the hallway of life.
[time=2587] I love the Bible.
[time=2591] The Bible has been the greatest means for me to know God, to have intimacy with God.
[time=2596] But even Jesus talked about the danger of pursuing the Bible or scriptures at the expense of
[time=2606] a relationship with God.
[time=2607] Look what he says in John 5 verses 39 through 40.
[time=2611] He says to these Pharisees, "Guys develop in a righteousness of their own.
[time=2615] The deepest darkness is pretending there's no darkness at all." You diligently study the scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life.
[time=2624] These are the scriptures that testify about me, Jesus says.
[time=2629] Yet you refuse to come to me to have life so a abundant spiritual vitality of righteousness
[time=2637] of life based on the life of another.
[time=2641] See, that's what's different of being in Christ than religion.
[time=2646] Religion is all about my own enlightenment.
[time=2648] I earn my way to the deity of the universe if I think there is one.
[time=2654] But I'm not going to call it Christianity.
[time=2656] To be in Christ is to have a relationship with the personal God of the universe and it's
[time=2662] about the righteousness or the light of another.
[time=2666] This is radically different, radically different.
[time=2670] It's amazing what a paradigm shift that that really is.
[time=2676] The danger in my own personal life has been because I love the Bible and I love it as a means to know God, is that I will study it to know more but not to know God more.
[time=2691] And I've found myself in that pattern a couple of times and just recently I thought that's
[time=2697] what I was doing.
[time=2698] I learned a lot of talks at once and I thought, did I stop during any of that and pray to
[time=2706] God, help me use this as a means to know you more.
[time=2710] Did my intimacy with God grow in preparing all those talks at once?
[time=2715] I've got to tell you, it sounds a lot like a pastor who had the issue of moral failure
[time=2722] in his church and he had a friend, we learned this at the leadership somebody a year ago, Wayne Cadero, a pastor in a church in Hawaii and he went to him and he said, how could you do that?
[time=2730] And the guy says, well, he starts going on about how he could do the moral failure thing and Pastor Wayne Cadero says, no, I understand how that can happen.
[time=2738] He says, what I want to know is how could you continue to teach the Bible?
[time=2744] And the guy goes, oh, the pastor who had the moral affairs said, I can tell you that.
[time=2750] He said, Wayne, I would spend my weeks doing this.
[time=2755] And I should have been doing this.
[time=2763] And that's the danger of anyone who takes his faith seriously, is that we miss the light,
[time=2771] the personal God of the universe through this on the other side.
[time=2778] Walking in darkness is a lie, but there's hope.
[time=2785] Walking in the light is true.
[time=2788] Walking in darkness is a lie and it absolutely leads death and destruction and hurt and heartache
[time=2798] and pain.
[time=2800] Walking in light is true and it brings hope and it brings life and it brings all the things
[time=2809] that God has for us, walking in light is true, go right back if you would to our passage
[time=2815] 1 John 1, it says, if we have, if we say verse 6, if we say that we have fellowship
[time=2821] with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie.
[time=2825] No, notice he doesn't say anything specifically about what the walking in the darkness looked like, but then watch what happens in verse 7.
[time=2832] And yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth, verse 7.
[time=2836] But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, and then I just want you to
[time=2842] see two things right here from the text, two things he offers for you and I, two things for us to see and grasp and take hold of two things that happen, two things that are there, two things that are present in the life of one who is walking in the light.
[time=2858] One who has fellowship with him and is walking in the light, look what it says, two things.
[time=2863] We have fellowship with one another.
[time=2867] He could have said anything.
[time=2869] He could have gone anywhere at that point.
[time=2872] But isn't it amazing that where he goes is that we'll have fellowship with each other.
[time=2880] You raise your hand, you want to have a life that evidences that.
[time=2883] He says you'll have fellowship with each other and then the last part there and the blood
[time=2889] of Jesus, the blood of Jesus' son will cleanse you, cleanses us from all sin.
[time=2897] Fellowship, let me just say this to you.
[time=2902] You've heard us say this before.
[time=2904] I'm sure you'll hear us say this again.
[time=2906] Let me just take this opportunity right here in this discussion to say this to you again.
[time=2914] We started this study three weeks ago by saying that it was the heart and the intention of
[time=2920] our elders and our staff.
[time=2921] It was the heart of this place was to go through 1 John for a very specific purpose.
[time=2927] And that very specific purpose was we realized that we have a lot of people coming through these doors.
[time=2932] I said it, we're thankful for attenders, but the desire of our heart is to see attenders
[time=2939] move from just being attenders to being faithful, true, genuine followers of Christ.
[time=2947] Our hope is to see more and more of you begin to understand and realize what it means to
[time=2953] be a disciple, to be one who follows the Lord.
[time=2957] Not about religion, but instead about a relationship with Him.
[time=2961] And so what we're seeing already here is that those who follow Christ, those who raise their hands and claim to have fellowship with Him, they walk in the light.
[time=2971] And the first great descriptor here of walking in the light is that you would have fellowship.
[time=2977] It's a great word in the original language.
[time=2979] It means companionship.
[time=2982] It means closeness.
[time=2984] It means a shared intimacy based upon that which brings us together.
[time=2989] There are a lot of things that bring a lot of people together.
[time=2992] I was at a college football game yesterday in Iowa, 75,000 people.
[time=2999] We were, games started at 11, you know, and the tailgating I think started at 8.
[time=3004] And there's a lot of stuff that brings people together.
[time=3007] The tents go up and the stereos get turned on and the balls start getting thrown.
[time=3011] I mean unbelievable camaraderie and spirit and fun and all that kind of stuff.
[time=3019] Nothing necessarily wrong or evil about all that.
[time=3021] Maybe there's some things going on there that you and I wouldn't do, but here's the thing.
[time=3025] That's not fellowship.
[time=3026] That's not Koinenea.
[time=3029] We get to have Koinenea.
[time=3032] We get to be together because of the spirit that binds and bonds us together.
[time=3038] We get to experience with each other the coming alongside, the encouragement and the authenticity
[time=3044] and the support and the truth speaking, real, genuine followers of Christ will be as they
[time=3053] walk in the light, they will be experiencing the one and others.
[time=3057] Look at the screens again.
[time=3058] I did this for you a couple of weeks ago.
[time=3059] I want to just show it to you briefly.
[time=3061] If you're going to raise your hand with me and if we're going to walk this road together, he says those that walk in the light, basically, then you would be described like this.
[time=3072] These things would be evidenced in your life because this is fellowship with one another.
[time=3078] Are you loving each other and serving each other and comforting each other?
[time=3084] Are you exercising and practicing hospitality with each other and speaking truth to each other and confessing sin to one another?
[time=3094] One of the great privileges of relationship and fellowship and community in the body admonishing
[time=3101] each other and bearing one another's burdens.
[time=3104] When we walk in the light, we have fellowship with one another.
[time=3109] We're devoted to each other and accepting.
[time=3113] We're accepting of one another completely, absolutely accepting of each other, bearing
[time=3124] with each other, praying for each other, building up one another, encouraging one another, forgiving
[time=3130] each other, spurring one another on toward love and good deeds.
[time=3135] You look at all that.
[time=3136] You think, gosh, Pastor Kelly, there really shouldn't be any friction, tension, or disagreements with us at all.
[time=3141] If we were all doing that, it's true.
[time=3147] It should be good with us.
[time=3148] It should be rich with us.
[time=3150] We might hit some bumpy roads, but because of our commitment to each other and because we're walking in the light, we experience fellowship, the one and others.
[time=3162] I would just love Mitch and I were going through this first hour, and he just asked Eric, and then in the middle of first hour, he asked Eric if we could get these on the website for you, and they'll be on the website tonight for you.
[time=3172] You can just take these two slides, you can just go to our website, you can just write them down or just copy them, whatever you want to do.
[time=3180] These would be good things for you and I to look at this week as we think about the presence of fellowship in our lives, in our hearts, in our relationships.
[time=3189] It gives you two things right there in the text that are consistent with walking in the light.
[time=3194] Fellowship with each other and?
[time=3198] Cleanse from sin by Jesus.
[time=3199] It's important to realize cleansed, and it's important to realize by Jesus.
[time=3206] In the end, it says purified.
[time=3208] It's symbolic of a stain that is totally removed.
[time=3213] I don't know about you, but I hate stains on my clothes.
[time=3215] I hate stains on the carpet, and I can't stand it until they're removed.
[time=3217] That was the other thing I thought when you called me that morning about your head, I thought, my gosh, he must be bummed.
[time=3222] There must be blood on the floor.
[time=3224] That would have been bad.
[time=3225] Isaiah 118, this is an Old Testament idea, and I remember when we were at Stillwater with communion and baptism, I would repeat this to people as you would come up after
[time=3236] handling the coal, and I'd wipe the hand dry.
[time=3240] In Isaiah 118, it says your sins were red like scarlet, but now they're white like snow.
[time=3248] It's a stain that's totally removed.
[time=3251] Hebrews 914 says that Jesus cleansed us from all sins stained, and Jesus said that he is
[time=3257] the light of the world, and when we surrender our hearts to him, when we humble our hearts to him, the person of God, then we reflect that light, and Paul said that this light shines
[time=3267] in the lives of others.
[time=3269] This is on the screen, this is one of the most beautiful passages in all of Scripture, in
[time=3275] my opinion, for we do not preach ourselves, not our own enlightenment, but Jesus Christ is Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake, tremendous humility here.
[time=3285] For God who said, let light shine out of darkness, made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of intimacy, intimacy of the glory of God in the face or the identity of Christ, but we have this treasure in charge of clay.
[time=3302] To show that this all surpassing power is from God and not from us.
[time=3306] The picture is that 2,000 years ago you had the crack clay pots, the crack clay jar, and the light would shine through the cracks, and that's what God wants to do with you, and it's what he wants to do with me, is he wants his light to shine through us, not our own enlightenment, but his light to shine through us, and that was Jesus' idea in the sternum out, he said, you're the light of the world, go let your light shine so that people will praise your Father in heaven.
[time=3329] What we're asking you to do today is a self-inventory.
[time=3333] Are you saying you have fellowship with him and yet walking in darkness?
[time=3336] Are you trusting in your own enlightenment?
[time=3338] You know, how you're doing really on the walking and darkness thing?
[time=3343] The deepest darkness is pretending there's no darkness at all, and so are you walking in the light, the two measures that John gives for it here in 1 John is you'll have fellowship with one another, a relationship with the light, a relationship with Christ, a relationship with God, is inextricably linked in Scriptures writing, especially John's
[time=3363] with relationship and fellowship with other people.
[time=3367] They go together, and the second one is do you really realize that the stain of sin is removed and cleansed from your life when you surrender your life to Christ, but it was done by another, it was done by the righteousness of Christ.
[time=3382] Now go let that light shine through our broken jars of clay.
[time=3387] Would you stand right where you're at?
[time=3388] Just don't leave, we're just going to close here in a word of prayer, but just stand if you would quietly.
[time=3392] Let me ask you to bow your heads if you wouldn't close your eyes and let me and Mitch just do our best to leave you with this thought, his light, his light, my friends, not yours.
[time=3402] One of the great tragedies that we experience, one of the great heartbreaks of my life is
[time=3409] the circumstances and situations I find myself in where I end up talking with and sitting
[time=3416] with and being with those who are on the verge of life changing, life altering, life damaging,
[time=3424] life destroying decisions and sharing with them, trying my best to share with them the
[time=3432] word of light, the truth, and to hear them say, "Well, this is what I think."
[time=3443] This is what I think, enlightened versus walking in the light.
[time=3449] I know, Father, God, I pray that we would, as a people, be willing to submit and humble
[time=3456] ourselves and our thoughts and opinions and even what we think to what you have said
[time=3463] is true.
[time=3464] Oh, God, may we humble ourselves and ask for help wherever we might need it.
[time=3468] To walk as you have called us to walk in the light in relationship with you and with others,
[time=3476] God, please give us strength to do that very thing and we'll thank you for it in your son's precious name we pray, amen.
[time=3486] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
