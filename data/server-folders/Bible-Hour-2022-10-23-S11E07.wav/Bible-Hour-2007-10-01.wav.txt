[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age.
[time=49] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=55] Well hello and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=64] My name is Kelly Bird and I have the privilege.
[time=67] And I mean that.
[time=68] It is a privilege to serve on the team here at Blackhawk Ministries and we are so very thankful that you have tuned in.
[time=74] What you will see this morning on the Bible Hour is the beginning of a 5 week series that we are very excited about and very much looking forward to.
[time=82] The title that we have given this 5 week series is Wet Cement Impressions for Life.
[time=89] And what we are doing here at Blackhawk is the beginning of a 3 year capital funds campaign.
[time=94] It is a project that represents potentially millions of dollars.
[time=99] That is right.
[time=100] Millions of dollars that we believe over the next 3 years, God may allow us to raise in
[time=106] an effort to really deepen and further our ministry reach.
[time=110] And over these next 5 weeks we want all of you that call Blackhawk home.
[time=115] And I don't mean so much by that you are here every week, but if you are a friend of our ministry, if this is a broadcast that you on a regular basis find real support and encouragement in, then we want you to know what is going on here.
[time=130] This is a very big 5 weeks.
[time=132] And as we try to in these 5 weeks really teach and envision and inform people about this project,
[time=140] our hope is that those of you in the broadcast audience will feel very much a part of this
[time=146] process.
[time=146] I am so grateful, as I know many of you are, for what God has allowed us to be a part of over these last 35, 40 years here at Blackhawk.
[time=155] We believe what cement impressions for life, this project that God has led us to, we believe
[time=161] it has the potential to really posture us for the next 35 to 40 years.
[time=167] And in the midst of that I think we will need your help.
[time=169] We will need your support.
[time=170] And I want you to listen.
[time=172] I want you to take all this in over these next 5 weeks.
[time=175] And I hope you will be encouraged.
[time=178] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=180] Thanks for being a part of our family.
[time=182] I want to say this to you, if as we go through these 5 weeks and as we explain this project and the potential reach and impact that it has, if you have any questions at all, if
[time=192] there is anything that God puts on your heart, if there is anything that I could clarify for you, as we try our best to explain this, I hope you will shoot me a line.
[time=200] I hope you will just send me an email and let me know what is on your heart.
[time=204] We are thankful for your support, thankful for your partnership in this greatest endeavor of all, as we do our best to help seeking people here and around the world, find and
[time=215] then know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=218] Thanks for tuning in.
[time=219] Thanks again for your friendship.
[time=221] God bless you.
[time=222] Have a great week.
[time=223] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=240] Hi.
[time=241] I'm Karla Softrank.
[time=242] I've been with Black Hawk Church for four years, however, my history goes back a long way.
[time=246] In 1974, I was in first grade here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=250] Ms. Tophalo was my first grade teacher and my desk was right over there.
[time=253] Some of my best memories at Black Hawk Christian School were sword drills.
[time=257] We'd hold up the Bible in our hands and our teacher'd call out a reference and we had to see how fast that we could find it in the Bible.
[time=264] I also remember the Jagathon at Black Hawk years ago where we only had four chairs out front in the parking lot that we ran around and the moms counted for us.
[time=271] It wasn't anything like it is now.
[time=275] My other memory is when they added on the gym to the building and how excited we were as a school to have a gym and a stage and to be able to change clothes, the girls were dressed as Becklin.
[time=285] So we had to wear bloomers and stuff our dresses in those bloomers and so to be able to change down in a dressing room was just absolutely awesome for us.
[time=292] All these memories made a huge impression on me here at Black Hawk Christian School, and probably the biggest was when I accepted Christ as my Savior.
[time=299] It was 1974, I was in first grade and it was tough, it was my teacher and she used to tell us every day about how Jesus had died on the cross for us and how he could be our Savior.
[time=309] And she used to ask us every day if we wanted to accept him, we could come to her.
[time=312] One day it was a quiet time and I just walked up to her desk and asked her, I just told her I wanted to accept Jesus and she took me out in the hallway immediately and put her arm around me and we prayed together and I accepted him as my Savior.
[time=324] And then we came in and the celebration started from there, she shared it with the classroom, she shared it with all the teachers and sent a note home for my family to know.
[time=331] That impression laid the foundation for the rest of my life, I went to school, finished up and met my husband Todd, we were married in May 23rd, 1992 and had 15 years of just
[time=342] great spiritual growth with the two of us.
[time=344] We were blessed with two daughters, Abby, who is in sixth grade here at Black Hawk Christian School and she will be 12 and Olivia, who is in third grade here at Black Hawk and she is going to be nine.
[time=355] They just love Black Hawk, this is their home and this is where they want to spend time.
[time=359] If you think about it, they're here more than they actually are at home so it's a great environment, it's a godly environment, it's safe for them.
[time=366] Abby wants to be in every activity that there is to be offered, she's my spirited child and Black Hawk gives her that safe godly environment and Olivia is kind of my quiet spirit so to
[time=376] grow close friendships and closeness with her teachers is very important for her and again we can find that love right here.
[time=382] Well I'm thankful for all that I've just shared with you.
[time=385] There's a little extra part to the story that just makes this place even more of a blessing than it already is.
[time=394] Well like Carla said there, there is some more to the story, we want to share that rest
[time=400] of the story with you but these are the soft ranks.
[time=403] That was a huge stretch for Carla, I think she did a great job.
[time=406] Would you thank them for helping out here, she did good.
[time=414] This is Todd and Carla, Abby and Olivia and Todd I think I'll just let you share what
[time=420] the rest of the story is and you can just kind of pick it up where Carla left off.
[time=426] As you heard on the video, Carla accepted Jesus into her heart in first grade and 30
[time=432] years later Olivia here was also in first grade in the exact same classroom and she
[time=440] accepted Jesus into her heart.
[time=443] And I just, you know Olivia brought home the note, Carla talked about bringing home a note from her teacher and Olivia also brought home a note too regarding accepting Jesus into
[time=455] her heart.
[time=456] Wow.
[time=458] Pretty cool.
[time=459] Yeah, pretty amazing.
[time=466] That is just a story, you know, a pretty amazing one and one that we're pretty thankful for.
[time=474] As we think about our future as a ministry, as we think about what cement, as we think about impressions for life, it's privilege that we have really, each of us to be a part
[time=485] of something where God allows us to mold and shape the hearts and lives of young ones
[time=492] and, you know, older ones, doesn't matter.
[time=495] But just the realization that sometimes when I, you know, back in 1974 when a life gets
[time=501] molded and shaped and then 30 years later, boy, to see how that just plays out, it's an amazing thing and that is so much of what what cement is about and I'm so thankful
[time=512] for the Saul Franks, not only are they friends but they're a part of this family and they
[time=518] have in the last few years around here and even in recent discussions about what cement,
[time=524] they've just evidenced a real willingness to jump in and give of their time and their talent and their treasure and I know that I know how much it means to them.
[time=534] Todd, when you when you think about you and Carla and the girls and your decision to really jump in and support something like this project that we're going to begin to explain today, maybe just share with the folks why it's so easy for you guys, why it means so much to jump in and help with something the way I know you guys are planning on doing.
[time=552] Well, I, of course, heard about the Wet Cement campaign, which I think is a great name laying
[time=560] the foundation, the impressions that the teachers, Kelly, the church, the whole black
[time=567] hawk ministries have given our family, our children, my wife, that's so much she's so
[time=577] strong spiritually and godly and same with our kids, that when we heard about the campaign, we wanted to help out so that we could help future generations of children and families
[time=589] in Fort Wayne and also around the world.
[time=593] Well, and that's exactly what our hope is for you all, for everybody that calls this
[time=601] place home, that there might be a willingness in you to really listen in the days to come.
[time=607] Not so much to me, not so much to our leadership, we'll do our best to communicate with you.
[time=613] But our hope is that you'll listen to God in the weeks to come and be willing in your own heart and life and in your own circumstance to contribute, to invest in not just what
[time=625] he's doing now, but what we hope and believe he wants to do through us for years to come.
[time=629] We're thankful for what he did in Carla.
[time=632] We're thankful for what he did in Olivia and Abby and Todd.
[time=636] We're so thankful for the families, the individuals that he continues to touch.
[time=640] And it's all about, and you've heard me say this before, we are so thankful to be a part of something where people's lives get what changed, where people get transformed.
[time=653] And I just want you to listen as Corbin sings.
[time=655] I just want you to kind of take in.
[time=657] It's kind of a theme song, if you will, for what we not only believe in and are so thankful to get to be a part of, but it's what we hope God will do through this effort.
[time=666] Over these next few weeks and over these next three years, listen as he sings, be encouraged and just ask God to open your heart to change you while he changes others.
[time=701] We're thankful for what we hope and believe in and how we live and free of our shame.
[time=708] We want to show you that we're thankful for the new earth with open peace.
[time=715] And help us to urge more than single.
[time=721] And give him freedom, she hands and feet.
[time=730] We have been blessed, are we gonna be a blessing?
[time=737] We have been loved, and come to bring love.
[time=744] And we've been invited, will we share the invitation?
[time=752] We have been changed, to bring change, to bring change.
[time=777] Hey, it's Corbin Plagues.
[time=778] Let me just ask you a question this morning.
[time=780] You might want to, you can bow your heads, you can, you can leave them up.
[time=785] You can, you can look to the sky, you can look down at the ground, doesn't matter.
[time=790] I just want you to focus for just a moment on the great truth of that song.
[time=794] And about you being changed.
[time=797] And I want to just ask you, who in the room, and you don't have to raise your hands, but I know there'd be many of you.
[time=804] Who's been changed?
[time=807] Who in the room has been transformed?
[time=810] Think about that for a moment.
[time=813] Not just that miraculous, redeeming change that took place when you came to faith.
[time=820] I suppose many of us can consider that.
[time=823] We can think back to what life was like and where we were headed and what all had transpired.
[time=829] And then God so radically and graciously reaches in and redeems us.
[time=835] There was some change, I know.
[time=838] What about the change, though, that He continues to work in you?
[time=841] What about the way that He patiently and lovingly continues to offer His grace?
[time=848] What about the change in you the last five years?
[time=852] What about the change that has transpired in the last six months?
[time=857] Whoever you are, whatever your story is this morning.
[time=861] And I guess I would ask you just to bow for just a moment.
[time=864] And would you just thank Him right now?
[time=867] Would you do that?
[time=868] Would you, in your own words, thank Him this morning for the change and transformation that He's brought?
[time=875] And would you ask Him to give you strength and courage to not only continue to change,
[time=881] but to strengthen courage to offer that which has changed you?
[time=887] Christ and His Spirit and the word of truth?
[time=893] Pray that it will give you the courage and strength and readiness to offer that to others.
[time=900] Father God, what an encouragement to think back on the change that you have brought in our lives.
[time=907] We thank you for the difficulties that you've brought us through.
[time=910] We thank you, God, for the hard lessons learned.
[time=913] And we thank you for the joy that is ours in knowing you.
[time=917] And oh God, would you continue, please, to change us so that we could be a people that would be so very willing to offer that change to a world that desperately needs it.
[time=929] And we'll thank you for that, and we'll look forward to that in your son's precious name we pray.
[time=935] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=940] Thanks, Corinne.
[time=943] Well, hey, I want to just say welcome to you this morning.
[time=946] Those of you in the Blackhawk family, we have been so looking forward to the beginning of this five, six-week stretch where we are going to do our very best to share something with you, something of great importance.
[time=956] If you're new this morning, if you're visiting, we're so thankful that you're here, you are more than welcome to listen in.
[time=962] This is probably a great timing thing.
[time=966] If you're coming and wondering about this place and our family and what God is doing here and where we're headed, these would be five, six great weeks for you to just kind of come in and join us and get a sense for that.
[time=980] Our hope is that we'll be very, very clear with that in the days to come.
[time=984] Before we jump in, though, this morning to about five weeks of teaching and information regarding some plans that we as leaders at Blackhawk have made in recent days, I want to read for you a verse, a verse from the Book of Job.
[time=1001] Would you turn there back in the Old Testament?
[time=1004] I want to read to you a verse from the Book of Job that brings great comfort and great peace to those of us who with great fear and trepidation have made these plans.
[time=1017] And I hope you understand what I'm saying there.
[time=1019] We as leaders, you know, we are called of God to lead.
[time=1024] Plans do get made.
[time=1025] They're prayerfully and thoughtfully and carefully made, but nonetheless, plans get made.
[time=1031] Anytime you make a plan, and any time that plan has to do with the bride of Christ, any time that plan has to do with the church, any time that plan has to do with ministry, there is just a great deal of fear and trepidation that comes with that.
[time=1045] And I want to just read to you a verse, a friend of mine showed me this, just this week, and it was a great reminder to me.
[time=1052] And I'm going to just get this out of the way, so all of you who want to laugh and make fun of me, you go right ahead.
[time=1060] It's true, I'm tired of squinting to see my Bible.
[time=1064] Go ahead, you're going to laugh.
[time=1066] That's good, thank you, that's enough.
[time=1070] Let me read this to you, can I?
[time=1072] Job 42, verses 1 and 2, just a great thing to start with this morning as we talk about plans.
[time=1080] Then Job answered the Lord and said, "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted."
[time=1092] Job answered the Lord and said, "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose, some translations actually read plans, and that no plans, no purpose of yours God can be thwarted."
[time=1106] And here's the deal I want you to sense this morning as we start.
[time=1109] We have tried all along in this process.
[time=1112] We have given it an enormous effort to have our plans, what we begin this morning, to kind of roll out to you and share with you with great humility and with great caution.
[time=1124] And yet with great excitement, we have from the beginning tried our very best to have these plans be a reflection of his.
[time=1133] I just want you to know that there are times when we get that right, and there are times when we miss that.
[time=1138] And we are just hoping that God will, as we share this with you, we hope that he will confirm them.
[time=1144] We hope that there will be a sense where you feel and we feel as a family encouraged to begin to try and move in a certain direction.
[time=1153] I just want you to know that it's been done over the last year and a half, a lot of prayer, a lot of thought, a lot of discussion.
[time=1159] And we bring these to you this morning and in the weeks to come, knowing that God in his perfect will will allow to happen what he wants.
[time=1170] What he wants from the project, what he wants from these five weeks will in the end, right?
[time=1176] Will be done.
[time=1178] Amen?
[time=1179] And that brings great comfort.
[time=1181] Well, today, as Corbin mentioned earlier, we begin a five-week series that will be our very best effort to teach, envision and inspire you, you and the Blackhawk family,
[time=1194] to better understand and embrace what I believe deep inside of me is a God-directed, God-given opportunity for Blackhawk Ministries
[time=1203] for our church, for our school, and for our broadcast.
[time=1207] The opportunity is called wet cement, impressions for life.
[time=1213] I don't know what comes to your mind when you hear that phrase, wet cement, impressions for life.
[time=1219] I think there's just something about a freshly poured driveway or a freshly poured slab out in the backyard, a sidewalk, whatever it might be.
[time=1229] There's just something extremely compelling about that.
[time=1233] There is, I think, innate in each of us, and I think God put it there.
[time=1236] There's this desire to leave a mark.
[time=1238] I think there's a desire in us to make an impression.
[time=1242] And I think this idea of being able to mold with God's health, obviously, to mold and shape hearts and lives for all of eternity is something that so many of us in the room can relate to.
[time=1255] What an amazing privilege God has given us, wet cement, impressions for life.
[time=1260] It is a capital funds on one hand.
[time=1263] It is a capital funds project that I will invite all who call Blackhawk comb to participate in in an effort to raise millions of dollars to further and deepen our ministry reach here and around the world.
[time=1278] And while I cannot wait, and I mean that, I can't wait to share with you with all of you the history of the project and the specific components of the project.
[time=1289] While I cannot wait to share all of that and communicate that and try and answer questions about that and help you connect the specifics of the component to the vision that God has given us.
[time=1300] While I want to get into as quickly as I can the specifics, I can't get into refuse to get into the specifics of the project before we get into the heart behind the project.
[time=1317] I want to spend some time this morning making sure that you understand the heart behind this endeavor.
[time=1325] The heart behind it is something that means a great deal to me and I believe the heart behind what cement goes far, far, far beyond the project itself.
[time=1336] Here's what I mean.
[time=1337] I'm convinced, for instance, I'm convinced the next five weeks will really have more to do with the future of your life.
[time=1345] That's right.
[time=1346] I believe the next five weeks will really have more to do with the future of my life, with the future of our lives and the future of this ministry than necessarily the future of this project.
[time=1358] I think the heart behind this thing, I think the vision for it goes way beyond five, six weeks, October, November, a three-year capital campaign.
[time=1369] All my friends, it's much, much bigger and much broader and much more important than that.
[time=1375] Think of it this way, wet cement, this project, if you will, it's a three-year deal.
[time=1382] I mean, if we're just looking at the facts of the thing, it's a three-year capital funds opportunity meant to provide a chance for everybody to make a three-year sacrificial above and beyond pledge to see our ministry capacity furthered and deepened
[time=1400] here at 7,400 East State and around the world as well.
[time=1404] That's the project.
[time=1405] It's a three-year deal.
[time=1406] Now, the heart behind the project, the discussion that we're about to enter into right here, the vision for wet cement and really the vision for our church in the days to come, that's about a 40-year deal.
[time=1424] And why do I say 40? Well, I say 40 because the first 40 of this place has been absolutely miraculous.
[time=1437] The first 40 years of Black Hawk Ministries, I mean, what took place back in the late '60s when Pastor Younger and that amazing family of folks at Immanuel Baptist right here in Fort Wayne, they had a vision.
[time=1450] They had this heart to not really just be about themselves.
[time=1453] It wasn't about necessarily building the biggest church in Fort Wayne.
[time=1457] They wanted to minister to the whole of Fort Wayne.
[time=1460] And so over the years, God allowed them to plant, to send out people from their own family, trained and equipped to plant, I believe, 12 churches in the greater Fort Wayne area.
[time=1472] And Black Hawk Baptist Church was one of those. And I don't know if you can see the picture up on the easel at the top there. I think there you go, they got on the screen.
[time=1483] That was the, that was our beginning when just a dozen or so folks from Immanuel came to the corner of state and lame iron and said, we'll be faithful and we'll do our best to be used of God, to bring change and to bring transformation
[time=1501] into the hearts and lives of those in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=1505] And so they came and they did that.
[time=1507] They got a little trailer and they put a steeple up on top and got some steps and threw up some railings and had church.
[time=1514] And all my goodness did God do an amazing thing.
[time=1517] Pastor David Jeremiah came and began to do what Black Hawk has always been known for.
[time=1524] What we've tried to over the years stay so very true too. He began to teach and he began to explain the story of redemption.
[time=1533] He began to teach and explain the scriptures and God did amazing things.
[time=1538] And it has been an incredible 40 years or so.
[time=1543] Little Carlos, you know, getting saved through Black Hawk Christian school, I had him bring the bell out again.
[time=1549] Aida, as she started the school, she would know complicated complex bell systems.
[time=1556] It was just a hand bell that she would use to bring the kids in from recess.
[time=1560] Many of you who went to school here years ago remember this exact bell.
[time=1564] There's a lot that God has done.
[time=1566] When I talk about what cement in recent weeks, I've really hesitated.
[time=1572] In fact, I don't say anymore. It's a new vision. It's not a new vision. It's a renewed vision.
[time=1578] This place has always been about from the very beginning, molding and shaping hearts and lives for all of eternity.
[time=1587] First 40 years have been incredible.
[time=1589] My question for us this morning is what will the next 40 look like?
[time=1596] What will the next 40 years entail and will you and I mean you, each and every one of you?
[time=1603] Will you put your hand into the freshly poured slab of kingdom opportunities?
[time=1611] Here at 7,400 East State and around the world.
[time=1614] What I'm saying is this, these next five weeks will.
[time=1617] They will. They'll entail vitally important information about a project that I believe is extremely compelling.
[time=1624] But beyond that, I believe these next five weeks can serve an even broader purpose.
[time=1630] And this is what I'm so looking forward to sharing with you this morning.
[time=1634] I believe these next five weeks can serve an even broader purpose than the project.
[time=1639] These next five weeks can bring an even greater opportunity if we'll cooperate, I think, with him.
[time=1646] I think these next five weeks can bring an even greater opportunity for us as a family to come to a place of extreme clarity.
[time=1656] Extreme, absolute clarity on the kind of church and the kind of people we're really going to be in the next 40 years.
[time=1665] What's Black Hawk Ministries, our church, our school, our broadcast, really going to be about?
[time=1673] What will define us? We can look back over the first 40.
[time=1677] And I'm telling you, we can just name three or four things that define this place and its ministry here and across the world.
[time=1685] There are some unique and very special things that God did.
[time=1689] And I'm asking you this morning to think with me, yes, about a project, but really to think beyond the project.
[time=1697] And what it is that God's going to do in and through us in the years to come?
[time=1703] What kind of a church? What kind of a people are we really going to be?
[time=1709] What's Black Hawk Ministries really going to be about?
[time=1713] And here's a really important question, and this kind of ties back to our first John study that we just started, that we'll come back to.
[time=1722] Who's in? Like who's going to be when it's all set and done? Who's really going to look at this vision?
[time=1732] And say, you know what? I'm completely and absolutely and thoroughly in.
[time=1737] I don't want to attend. I don't want to be a bystander.
[time=1743] I don't want to come in and be encouraged and leave and do nothing with it for six days and come back and just do the same thing all over again.
[time=1750] No, I want to be completely in. We've used for just illustration purposes.
[time=1756] You all know we've used the poker analogy in recent days around here where those guys play in poker on TV.
[time=1764] They get the good hand and they put their cards down.
[time=1767] They shove all their chips to the middle and they all say what? All in.
[time=1772] I'm glad some of you know that. We got some poker fans in here, do we?
[time=1779] Maybe we should have a wet cement poker night. I was just kidding. I was a joke. It was just a joke.
[time=1788] I think, I think there's some things coming. No, you guys, just be quiet back there.
[time=1793] I got a bunch of my buddies thinking I'm serious.
[time=1796] I think these next five weeks, my friends, have enormous potential for the bigger picture of where this ministry is going.
[time=1806] I think they have great potential for the project. I can't wait to get to the specifics.
[time=1811] I just want you to understand and I think then there's a reason.
[time=1815] There's a reason why in my mind I think these next five weeks have such enormous potential and the reason is this.
[time=1822] I sense and I've sensed it for about six months. I haven't said much to you.
[time=1826] We haven't communicated it in a broad general, you know, public sense.
[time=1830] I haven't written anything about it but I want to tell you this morning.
[time=1833] I've sensed and others around me have sensed and many of you, you know, have talked about it.
[time=1838] I think in the last six months God has been very clear with us as to a renewed picture of a ministry vision that's about as clear for me as it's ever been.
[time=1850] I told someone recently that in over 20 years of ministry in the local church never have I been so clear with respect to a ministry vision for our future.
[time=1861] There is today a picture in my heart and in my mind a picture of ministry inside and outside these four walls that's purposeful.
[time=1870] It's transformational. It's about the kingdom, not just about us.
[time=1874] It's collaborative. It's compelling and it is clearer than it's ever been for me.
[time=1880] And probably what excites me the most about it is that I sense and believe deep in my heart really that we've discovered it together.
[time=1888] I really feel like we have. I feel like in recent months God has and I'm going to take you back to a series we did about a year ago or so.
[time=1897] And it was a series that in many ways I think ignited the hearts and minds of many in this place.
[time=1904] Many of you probably know what I'm referring to.
[time=1907] I believe we've discovered this vision collectively and that means a lot to me.
[time=1912] I didn't go to some room somewhere and come up with it on my own.
[time=1915] I didn't read it in a book somewhere. I didn't get it at a conference.
[time=1918] I think together through the pages of Scripture and our times of ministry and life together.
[time=1924] I think we have together corporately as a family discovered this vision.
[time=1930] And I want to just tell you what it is.
[time=1932] And I don't think it's going to be a shock. I don't think it's going to be a surprise.
[time=1935] The verbiage of it isn't new in any way, shape, or form.
[time=1940] It is. I just want to say this. It's a picture of ministry that I could easily give the rest of my life to.
[time=1947] In fact, I think I will.
[time=1950] I hope you'll let me do that here.
[time=1955] I'd like to give the rest of my life. And I mean that.
[time=1958] This last six months to a year, it's been enormous for me to finally feel like in my heart this thing's really, really clear.
[time=1965] Other places, other guys, they can say it all kinds of ways.
[time=1969] And I absolutely love how different places and different guys say it different ways.
[time=1973] In my heart today, I want to just say to you, I believe God has led us to a vision of ministry in this place and around the world that is about priests that go.
[time=1987] Just that simply stated. I want to give the rest of my life to growing up teaching, discipling, encouraging a priesthood.
[time=2001] It's a very biblical concept. Again, most of you were around last year when we did the "I'm a Priest" series.
[time=2007] That is really all I want to do. I want to grow up priests.
[time=2011] I want to grow up first grade priests who pray to receive Christ with their teacher.
[time=2016] I want to grow up and be a part of a family that would grow up ninth and tenth grade priests.
[time=2021] I want to help young married couples be priests. I want to help red, yellow, black and white people be priests.
[time=2028] I want poor people and rich people to understand the benefits of priestly living.
[time=2033] It's all I want to do. It's be a part of a place that trains up and encourages priests that go.
[time=2043] Go, that's right.
[time=2047] Jesus, Jesus, when it was all said and done, Matthew 28, 19, I believe.
[time=2055] Some of you remember the scene. He's getting ready to leave. And he's got this ragtag bunch of guys that have done what priests do.
[time=2066] Priests spend time with God. Priests live in close proximity to God.
[time=2074] Priests live and eat and drink and sleep. I mean, they are priests are with God so they can get God all over them.
[time=2082] They can go and give God away to the people.
[time=2087] And here's Jesus with these priests, these guys that have followed him and been with him.
[time=2094] And with the rest of redemptive history about to unfold and with him getting ready to exit the scene.
[time=2102] He looks at these guys and he says to them, in essence, he says a great deal, you can see it on the screen.
[time=2108] But I just want you to see the first word, which is what, say it. Go.
[time=2115] Don't sit. Don't stay. Don't hide. I know you'll be afraid. Don't get comfortable. Don't congregate or settle in.
[time=2125] No, don't play it safe. Go. Go and do what priests do.
[time=2131] And this is what we've talked about around here for months, doing what priests do.
[time=2136] And we've said it a number of different ways. I want to just review that quickly.
[time=2140] But then I want to show you this morning just another new learning on this whole concept of what we as priests do
[time=2149] and how it is we think and live. What we've said so far are things like they show others what God is like.
[time=2156] If you're a priest, let me just clarify that priest, as we're using it here,
[time=2162] priest is someone who has come to faith in Christ, a believer, a genuine, born-again Christ follower
[time=2171] who has been redeemed, who has confessed their sin and proclaimed their need for a Savior.
[time=2178] And they have moved into this life-changing, eternity-altering relationship with him.
[time=2184] This is someone who has been transformed. And where the Scriptures say we're priests.
[time=2190] And what we've said in the past is that a priest is somebody who shows other people what God is like.
[time=2196] I asked him to put this mirror up here, just as a reminder to you, that when you and I have met with God,
[time=2203] when we've taken the time to meet with him, when we've studied him, when we've read him, when we've sung him,
[time=2210] when we've listened, when we've meditated, when we've memorized Scripture and hid it in our heart, when we've spent times of personal worship with him, when we have been doing the personal abiding thing with him,
[time=2223] walking with him, when that transpires, and when you and I do that faithfully,
[time=2229] we get this unspeakable privilege then of just being able to, we just get to go through life,
[time=2235] hopefully being a reflection, not of ourselves, but a reflection of who, of God.
[time=2241] It's an amazing concept, like we're like human reflections of the divine.
[time=2248] And we talked about that.
[time=2250] Priests are those who show others what God is like.
[time=2253] They get God all over them and then pass along God to others.
[time=2260] These have been great thoughts. These have been good truths for us to focus on.
[time=2264] I want to give you another one this morning as we talk more about and just come to terms with,
[time=2270] not only the vision behind this project, but what I believe God is calling us to for the next 40.
[time=2276] Go to 1 Peter, if you would, 1 Peter, chapter 2.
[time=2281] What else do priests do? What is it that priests are about?
[time=2285] How else are we going to define our existence as a priesthood?
[time=2290] What is the activity in the thought and the values and the choices of our life supposed to look like?
[time=2297] 1 Peter 2, verses 9 and 10 says this, "But you are a chosen race."
[time=2305] You see that? Peter here, writing to the church.
[time=2309] He says, "But you church." He's not writing to the nation of Israel, though we see reference here to what was said in Exodus.
[time=2319] Here he talks to the church. You see, the people of God were a chosen race.
[time=2324] The nation of Israel, as you look back through the whole redemptive story of the Scriptures, there was a time, yes, where on the mountain their God declared, that they were going to be His people.
[time=2335] That they were going to be a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession.
[time=2340] And yet as we see the story of Israel progress, we realize that they forfeited that for a time.
[time=2346] We realize that in their apostasy and in their unfaithfulness, they gave that up.
[time=2351] And so now the church comes on to the scene and here God through the pen of Peter declares to the church,
[time=2358] "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[time=2367] so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light."
[time=2375] You see it right there? So that. Go back up to the middle there, verse 9.
[time=2382] "We are a chosen race," my friends, "we are a royal priesthood." Why? What is it that we're supposed to do as a royal priesthood?
[time=2392] So that, so that what? So that you may add this to your list.
[time=2397] So that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
[time=2407] What an amazing thought. For you once, look at verse 10, "For you once were not a people."
[time=2415] What that basically means is you were once alone.
[time=2421] For you were once, verse 10, "not a people," but now you are the people of God.
[time=2427] You had not at one point in time, you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[time=2435] It's an amazing thought that you and I as a priesthood would be called to proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out.
[time=2446] A couple things I want you to see before we get into proclaiming the excellencies of Him.
[time=2451] Go back up to verse 9 where it says, "You are a royal priesthood." Not just any priesthood, my friends. No, our calling and your opportunity in mind is to be a part of a royal priesthood.
[time=2462] Royal because we are inextricably connected through faith in Christ and the seal that God brings to that transaction.
[time=2471] You understand that, right? When you fully surrender your heart and life to Him, it says in Ephesians 2 that you are sealed.
[time=2478] Romans 8 at the end talks about nothing ever being able to then separate you from the love of God.
[time=2488] When we come into relationship with Him through faith in Christ, by virtue of what Christ accomplished on the cross and in the tomb for us, we are by God's grace in.
[time=2500] And nothing, nothing can take us away from that.
[time=2504] We are inextricably connected to the King.
[time=2508] We are a royal priesthood devoted to the King, serving the King, living with the King.
[time=2515] What a place.
[time=2517] What a position.
[time=2519] I know many of you in the room this morning don't feel royal.
[time=2522] I know many of you in the room this morning find yourself in situations that would seem less than King Lane.
[time=2529] And I want to just remind you this morning, as a shepherd to His sheep, that in position, I know in the everyday of life maybe, but remember, that positionally and in reality, in your relationship with Him.
[time=2551] You are in that position of royal priestly service.
[time=2559] You belong to the King and you reside with Him.
[time=2563] And you are devoted to Him and He is devoted to you.
[time=2566] A royal priesthood.
[time=2569] What's that next phrase say in verse 9?
[time=2572] A holy nation.
[time=2573] This is our calling, my friends.
[time=2575] And we want to be about, we want to be a place that develops this, that builds into this, that disciples, young boys and girls with an understanding that this is who they are to be.
[time=2587] And this is how they are to live a holy nation, not just a royal priesthood, a holy nation.
[time=2593] What does that mean?
[time=2595] We've talked about this before.
[time=2596] You can write this down.
[time=2597] It means to be set apart.
[time=2598] It means there is a bunch of people here.
[time=2601] It means that the masses live here and it means that God has taken you and He has set you apart over here.
[time=2610] He has set you apart and He wants you to be a set apart and unique, not like any other kind of people.
[time=2618] He wants you to be, that's the definition of holy.
[time=2621] Holy is set apart and unique.
[time=2623] Holy isn't how long you wear your hair.
[time=2625] So we get this all mixed up.
[time=2626] Holy isn't what movies you see.
[time=2628] Holy isn't, you know, the kind of house you live in.
[time=2631] Holy isn't the length of your dress.
[time=2634] These are, these are legalistic things.
[time=2637] We have in our own humanness connected to holiness.
[time=2640] No holiness is a set apart and unique people, not set apart and unique, different or distinct because of physical outward external efforts.
[time=2650] No, but a unique and distinct people because of hearts that are fully surrendered.
[time=2657] And when you have a heart that is fully inclined, fully postured toward Him, when you have a heart 13, 14, 15, 16 year olds.
[time=2670] When you have a heart, young married couple, when you have a heart, senior adult, anybody, I don't care who you are, when your heart is fully inclined to Him.
[time=2682] When your heart is fully devoted to priestly living and wanting to meet with Him and study Him and read Him and sing Him and get Him all over you.
[time=2692] So you can go and share Him and be a reflection of Him to others.
[time=2696] When one's heart is fully His, then the things that you wear and the music that you listen to and the movies that you see in the length of your dress and hair, it all gets worked down.
[time=2710] Because you'll want nothing more than to honor Him and encourage others, a royal priest at a holy nation.
[time=2718] Here's what I want to get to though, look at this, here's what I want you to see today about what a priest does.
[time=2724] Priests proclaim, write this down, priests proclaim the excellencies of God.
[time=2732] You see it right there, the in verse 9, it's the only place, I learned this this week, it's the only place that this verb to proclaim, it's the only place in the entire New Testament that this verb is used.
[time=2745] Right here in this very unique section of scripture, he says that priests, royal priests and a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, they are a people who proclaim the excellencies of God.
[time=2759] Here's what the word means, it means to tell others things about God not previously understood.
[time=2766] To proclaim the excellencies of God means to communicate truth to those not familiar with that truth.
[time=2774] I love this one, to share what's excellent about God with those who don't yet know Him.
[time=2784] Think about it, who do you know, who do you work with, who do you live near, who's in your family, immediate or extended, who is in your world that doesn't today know or understand the excellencies of God.
[time=2802] Let me ask you this, how excellent is God, what is it about God that is so excellent, that is so right, what is it about God that is just so good.
[time=2819] And as you begin to like me kind of mentally just rattle off that list of things, you just think my goodness, there are people in my world who don't know that about Him, have never experienced that about Him.
[time=2830] And we're told here this morning that a royal priesthood is a people after God's own heart, a holy nation who go about in proper appropriate ways proclaiming and sharing with others the things about God not previously understood.
[time=2848] And why do we do that?
[time=2851] Why would you and I as priests be so inclined to want to in appropriate ways, in appropriate settings communicate this with the appropriate person in our life.
[time=2864] Well, look at verse 10, there's why, because you're so grateful, and you have so experienced his redeeming work, look at verse 10 for you once we're not a people.
[time=2876] But now you are the people of God, because once you are on your own and living without mercy is basically what verse 10 says, and now you've been redeemed, now you are a people, now you have a family, and today you have experienced mercy.
[time=2893] Not getting what you deserve, not getting what you deserved, mercy.
[time=2902] My friends, this is the heart, this is the heart, these kinds of truths, this picture of a priesthood that's mobile, this picture of a priesthood willing to go, whether it's across, listen, whether it's across the cubicle at work, whether it's across your block,
[time=2920] whether it's across town, across this country, or across the world, I want to be a part of a place that grows up people, disciples them and encourages them to be priests who meet with God and having met with him go.
[time=2937] And that is the heart behind this project, and more importantly it is the vision or picture of ministry I believe God is calling us to for the next 40 years.
[time=2949] And watch this, I've been saving this for you, I just think this is so cool, I think it is so right, and I am so thankful that we get to be a part of stuff like this, and watch what happens when a priest fulfills his or her calling to you pick it.
[time=2964] Show others what God is like, pass along God, reflect the divine, proclaim his excellencies.
[time=2970] When you and I faithfully function as priests, look what God allows us to be a part of, go to 1 Peter 3, 1 Peter 3, 18.
[time=2982] And before it comes on the screen, or before you read it, I want to just remind you of this, 1 Peter 3, 18, before we read it, remember who the greatest priest who ever lived was.
[time=2993] Who was the highest priest? Who was the most perfect priest? If ever there was somebody who represented God, if ever there was somebody who having been with God passed God along to others, if ever there was a greatest of all time, number one hands down priest, it was who?
[time=3013] Jesus, greatest priest ever, and look what Jesus as he fulfills his priestly function, and by the way you and I are to model our lives after who, say it out loud, Jesus.
[time=3029] Look what Jesus did, 1 Peter 3, 18. Oops, forgot, sorry.
[time=3038] For Christ also died for sins once and for all, the just for the unjust.
[time=3049] And here it is, so that he might bring us to who? To God.
[time=3057] Having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, look at that my friends, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, Jesus, the great high priest, goes about bringing people to God.
[time=3078] Add that to your list of what a priest gets the privilege of doing, and who wants to be a part of that?
[time=3088] Who wants to be a part of bringing people to God?
[time=3093] I do, and I know I'm not bringing them to God, bringing them to God, I know God's bringing them to himself, I realize theologically and doctrinally how that works.
[time=3105] What I don't understand is how it is that though that's true, he allows you and I to be absolutely, integrally a part of that process.
[time=3115] And it's what the greatest priest who ever lived, he brought people to God. We have the Aida Tophalo, who was faithful in those beginning days of Blackhawk Christian school to do her best, to cooperate with God, fulfill her priestly function, offer the Gospel, and hear God through Aida brings Carla to God.
[time=3138] And there's just story after story after story in this room, and there are countless thousands of stories still to be discovered and told, if you're willing, if you're willing with me to be a priest, who is absolutely and categorically and fully in so that we can go.
[time=3164] So that we can go and represent him. It's what Christ did and still does to this day, and when we move from religion to a relationship, it's what we're about here.
[time=3174] We're not about religion, we're about a relationship with Christ, and when people move from religion to a relationship with Christ, when people move from attending church, we've been talking about that, though we're thankful for those who attend.
[time=3188] And we want you to not just be in a tender, we want you to be fully surrendered and fully engaged in the greatest endeavor of all.
[time=3196] When people move from attending to following Christ, when we desire to make impressions that last a lifetime, helping mold and shape the eternal hearts and lives of those God has given to our care.
[time=3210] We're priests. We get to bring people to God. Pre-schoolers and Sunday schoolers and high school students and families and crisis and pastors living in poverty in Yvonnevo and people still rebuilding their lives in Biloxi and babies dying of AIDS and Nairobi.
[time=3231] A priesthood, mobile, willing to go.
[time=3241] In Jesus' name, I've been changed, I've been filled, I've been found, I've been freed, I've been saved.
[time=3254] In Jesus' blood, I've been loved, I've been cleansed and redeemed, I'll release you free and raised.
[time=3265] I'll show you that I'm grateful, you've been so generous to me.
[time=3277] How can I worship all and sing, live in a tantrum spell of peace?
[time=3290] I have been blessed, now I want to be a blessing, now I've been loved, now I want to bring love.
[time=3303] I've been invited, I want to share the invitation, I have been changed, to bring change, to bring change.
[time=3328] In Jesus' name, we are changed, we are called, we are chosen and adopted in the day.
[time=3343] In Jesus' blood, we are loved, we are new, we're forgiven and free of our shame.
[time=3354] We want to show you that, we're thankful, flooding your world in more than peace.
[time=3367] Help us to worship all and sing.
[time=3373] Living redemption and stampede, we have been blessed, now we're gonna be a blessing, we have been loved, now we're gonna bring love.
[time=3392] We've been invited, gonna share the invitation, we have been changed, to bring change.
[time=3402] We have been changed, to bring change, we have been changed, to bring change.
[time=3412] Thank you God.
[time=3414] Thank you for this new life, thank you for the invitation.
[time=3427] God, we want to live ain't loud enough to share the nature.
[time=3435] In your name, we have been saved, gonna shout about the Savior.
[time=3444] And we have been changed, to bring change, to bring change, we have been changed, to bring change.
[time=3469] We have been changed, to bring change.
[time=3499] We have been changed, to bring change, to bring change, to bring change, to bring change.
[time=3529] [MUSIC]
