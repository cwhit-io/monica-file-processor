[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore, go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=30] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age.
[time=49] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=74] Sing that verse first again, the word should be the fuel, the word should be the fuel
[time=93] for mission's flame, and going with a passion for a day, and going for a care about your
[time=103] praise, send us out, send us out, send us out.
[time=117] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I am so grateful that you've joined us again.
[time=122] I want to say a special word today.
[time=124] I just want to take a few minutes and speak with those of you that call Blackhawk Ministries
[time=130] home by way of the broadcast here.
[time=132] I know there are some of you who watch as you get ready to go and serve and minister and be a part of your own local church.
[time=139] We are so thankful for you, and thankful we can encourage you in your morning.
[time=143] I want to say a special word this morning to those of you that really consider Blackhawk your home, and yet maybe it's your home simply by virtue of this broadcast and our weekly
[time=154] opportunity to connect.
[time=157] I haven't done this in a long, long time, but I really feel as if God is prompting me and leading me to ask you and to invite you to consider being a part of something very, very special, something very significant here in the life of our Blackhawk ministry family.
[time=174] Just this last week, we embarked upon what will be a three-year journey, a three-year project that we're entitling, "Wet Submit, Impressions for Life." I want to invite you to go to our website, on our website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=189] You can actually click on the "Wet Submit" logo and learn all about this project.
[time=193] You can watch a promotional DVD.
[time=196] You can see and better understand all kinds of things about the project, and I also want to invite you to watch over these next four or five weeks.
[time=205] This will be a four to five-week series that we're in right now where we explain this endeavor to our family, and I hope that you'll listen.
[time=213] But here's what I want to invite you to do.
[time=215] Those of you that watch on a regular basis, I want to invite you and ask you if you would consider praying about giving.
[time=224] That's right.
[time=225] I'd like to ask you if you would think about, as the week's roll by here, if you would be willing in your heart to consider a gift.
[time=233] We're going to ask our family to make a three-year pledge above and beyond our normal giving.
[time=239] We're asking young people.
[time=241] We're asking single adults.
[time=242] We're asking families.
[time=243] We're asking everybody across the board to consider a three-year pledge, a pledge that
[time=249] will allow us to further our reach and further the impact that God is allowing us to have
[time=255] here and across the world.
[time=257] We want to train up priests who will go, and we want to see those priests minister here
[time=263] in Fort Wayne and in the streets of Biloxi and the orphanages of Nairobi.
[time=268] We want to do all that we can to further the reach and the scope of what God has allowed us to do.
[time=274] I want to ask you if you would think about, I want to ask you to consider giving to this incredible project.
[time=281] I'll come back to you in the weeks to come and give you some specific ways in which you could do that, maybe give you some more direction on how you could offer that gift
[time=291] in a way that could really make a difference.
[time=293] But I just wanted to this morning ask you, humbly and honestly, if you would think about giving to what's a myth.
[time=300] There is nothing greater in my estimation than the privilege God gives us to make impressions
[time=306] that will last a lifetime, and I hope you'll consider joining us in that greatest endeavor of all.
[time=312] God bless you.
[time=313] Thank you so much for tuning in, and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=330] My name is Mark Zulman, and I first attended Blackhawk in the first grade, and I graduated
[time=345] in 1986.
[time=348] There are several multiple people that have been in encouragement to me and have impacted
[time=354] me through my time in school at Blackhawk Christian School, several of the names that
[time=360] come to mind are Bob Freeborn, Steve Longbraig, Tom Cashin, and even more than that, but those
[time=368] are three guys that come to mind easily.
[time=371] Some of the good times that I remember at Blackhawk were mostly just like daily things
[time=381] that we would do.
[time=383] In my situation, Blackhawk does not have an elevator on the other side in school, and
[time=390] some of my classes were upstairs, and for me, some of my buddies before or after classes
[time=396] would have to carry me up and down the stairs to get to class, and they kind of use it as an excuse so they could be a little bit late to get to class, and it was just the relationships that we developed.
[time=406] And trust me, you know, never once did anything bad happen, they never dropped me.
[time=412] Spiritually, I think Blackhawk has prepared me immensely.
[time=418] The foundation that I developed through the teachers of Blackhawk, the Biblical Foundation,
[time=424] learning a Christian worldview, no matter what happens, the circumstances that occur
[time=430] throughout life, I've been able to filter that through the Christian worldview, and I know that God has my best interest in mine even during hard, difficult times.
[time=440] He's growing me, and God's more concerned with character than he is with my comfort,
[time=446] and it's been neat to see how God blesses.
[time=449] You know, through these hard times, you learn to depend on him more and trust him more, and
[time=456] that this relationship just grows, the relationship with Christ each day grows.
[time=463] I personally am excited about the outreach focus that Blackhawk has right now, in particular
[time=470] how we're looking at our congregation as priests, and how we're developing disciples
[time=476] of Christ that will be prepared here and impact their local communities, and that can
[time=482] be here in Fort Wayne, clear over in Kenya, Russia, you know, wherever God leads.
[time=493] Well, I'm so thankful that Mark was willing to take the time to shoot that video and
[time=508] have that be a part of our wetsoment presentation.
[time=512] Some of you know Mark, others of you don't, when he talked about his situation and being carried around, you know, Mark was, I think, 13, 14 years of age when a tree that was being
[time=525] cut down back deep in the woods kind of went the wrong way and ended up on his back.
[time=531] And it ended up with him being in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
[time=536] And boy, to hear him say with such conviction and with such peace that he knows God's more
[time=544] concerned about character than comfort, to know that we've had the privilege, and it's been that, the privilege to invest in young people like Mark, to make an impression to
[time=557] help shape and mold a young life.
[time=560] And to do that in a way that allows him now, we're so thankful for the strength and the
[time=566] ability that God gives us to make these impressions, because now you see a guy like Mark who is
[time=572] just enjoying his life and his family, so dedicated and so gifted in his craft in the
[time=580] medical arena.
[time=581] And we are so grateful for the countless numbers of stories, like Mark's, that we have the privilege
[time=588] of participating in as we try our best to kind of follow God in this endeavor of making
[time=595] impressions that will last a lifetime.
[time=598] I'm really, really grateful and thankful that you got to see that this morning.
[time=601] Hey, I want to say this to you just before we jump into some very specifics this morning
[time=607] about the project.
[time=608] I want to just kind of take you back to what Corbin talked to you about earlier this morning.
[time=613] It just so impacted me first hour.
[time=616] And to just be able to hear it again, second hour, I want to just remind you of how important it is that every one of you, I'm referring back to the Isaiah passage.
[time=628] When God asks that question, who will I send?
[time=633] And I want to just remind you that if you're here today, and we touched on this briefly last week, but I want to remind you, if you know him, if you're here today and you know
[time=644] him, you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him, I don't want you to forget that if you know him, he wants you to go, and he never ever stops wanting you to go.
[time=660] He always wants us to be a people who are willing to go, whoever you are, however long
[time=667] you've known him, whatever stage of life you're in, whether you're a junior high high school student, a young married couple, a mom and dad, a single adult, a senior adult, whoever
[time=678] you are, if you know him, the way spiritually the DNA he gave you is a DNA that by the very
[time=685] virtue of how you've been created spiritually, he never intends you and I to sit.
[time=693] There is always to be with that which he has given you, with that which he has built into you, with that which you have learned.
[time=700] There is always to be a willingness in you and me to go.
[time=704] Now again, just to be clear, by going, yes, we may, I shouldn't say we, by going he may
[time=711] have in store for you, Nairobi, he may have in store for you, Ivanovo, he may have in
[time=718] store for you, the ends of the earth, I don't know, but I also know this that when you come
[time=724] to know him, he also has in store for you a willingness to go across the street to a
[time=731] family whose yard might need to be raped, he may have, I know he has in store for you, the person in that cubicle that you work with in the marketplace.
[time=741] You see, going is going, going is taking what he has given you, going is taking what's
[time=747] been invested in you and as a priest, just like we talked about last week, there is a willingness in you to having been invested in, having gotten God all over you, having
[time=758] met with God a willingness to go and pass along his kindness and his compassion and his love and his justice and his mercy and his goodness.
[time=768] So I want to just encourage you, I want to encourage you to go, I want to encourage you to be creative, I want to encourage you to think about how it is you could go tonight,
[time=779] how it is you could go tomorrow, how you could be a follower of Christ willing each and every
[time=785] moment of your life to not be about you, to not be about your routine, to not be about
[time=791] your comfort, to not be about what you've got to do while doing those things that we
[time=797] have to do to be an individual, to be a couple, to be a family that looks for and has going
[time=805] and offering and giving antenna up is nothing like it, nothing like being a people who are
[time=815] willing to do that and I want to remind you this morning of something, just real foundational.
[time=820] This is very basic stuff but I want to make sure that you are reminded, that we are reminded
[time=826] of this. In the going, in the willingness to go, what gets accomplished is the very thing
[time=836] that God left us here for. Why did, let me ask you that question, why did God, why does God have us here? All of a sudden we're going to go real deep real quick, what's the reason
[time=847] for our existence? Why is it that you're here? Why are we here? And it's not about your business
[time=862] and it's not about your class, it's not about your company, it's not about your practice,
[time=869] it's not about your home, it's not about any of those things, it's not about your job necessarily,
[time=875] he has us here I believe to do two things and they're very, very, very, very related.
[time=882] I believe the Scripture is clear that we have been left here to make much of God. I believe the Scriptures are clear that we have been left here to bring glory and honor and praise
[time=894] to him and I believe that we bring glory and honor and praise to him when we're willing
[time=900] to be a people for God's own possession, a royal and holy priesthood, when we're willing to be
[time=907] the people that God's called us to be and we show others what God is like when we fulfill our
[time=913] priestly function, God receives glory. We give glory to God, we extend and we give honor and praise
[time=923] to him but when you and I function as the people that God designed us to be, when we pass along
[time=930] God to others, others end up giving glory and honor and praise to him and it's amazing,
[time=938] it's an amazing thing and we see it again and again and again in Scripture, just real quick, look at Matthew chapter 9, before we get into some specifics here that I can't wait to get into
[time=949] with you, just look quickly, I want to just remind you of this, look at Matthew chapter 9
[time=956] verses 2 to 8, we talked last week about how Jesus, how the Lord Himself is our ultimate example
[time=963] of the ultimate priest, if ever there was one who had God all over him and been passed God along to
[time=971] others, it was the Lord and it says in Matthew chapter 9, verses 2 to 8, it says, and they brought
[time=979] him a paralytic lying on a bed, seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic, take courage son,
[time=987] your sins are forgiven and some of the scribes said to themselves, interesting they said it to
[time=993] themselves, these scribes were thinking this inside their own minds, this fellow blasphemes and Jesus knowing their thoughts said why are you thinking evil in your hearts, which is easier
[time=1005] to say your sins are forgiven or to say get up and walk, but so that you may know that the son of
[time=1012] man has authority on earth to forgive sins, then he said to the paralytic, get up, pick up your
[time=1019] bed and go home, he passes along God's compassion, he passes along God's mercy, he passes along God's
[time=1029] love and he got up and went home, but when the crowd saw this they were awestruck and everybody
[time=1036] said out loud, glorified God who had given such authority to men, look at Matthew 5, go back just
[time=1044] a few pages, go back to Matthew 5, 14, Matthew 5, 14 says you are the light Jesus here, again talking,
[time=1054] he says you are the light of the world, a city set on a hill cannot be hidden nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand and it gives light to all who are in the house,
[time=1068] let your light people, he says let your light shine before men in such a way, pass along God
[time=1076] to others, be a human reflection of the divine, be cohens, be priests, let your light shine before
[time=1086] men in such a way that they may see your good works and what say it out loud, glorify your father
[time=1094] who is in heaven, let's just look at one more, the priestly function, this opportunity God gives us
[time=1102] to be priests who go and in the going we pass along God to others and in that process God
[time=1109] receives glory, it's the one thing we've been left here to do 1529, look there if you would Matthew
[time=1115] chapter 1529 departing from there, departing from there Matthew 1529, Jesus went along by the
[time=1125] sea of Galilee and having gone up on the mountain he was sitting there and large crowds came to him
[time=1133] bringing with them those who were lame, those who were crippled, blind, mute and many others
[time=1139] and they laid them down at his feet and he passed along God to others, he exhibits God's compassion
[time=1148] and God's love and God's mercy, he healed them so the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking
[time=1157] the crippled restored and the lame walking and the blind seeing and they what say it out loud,
[time=1163] glorified the God of Israel, this is this is the privilege my friends that you and I have,
[time=1174] those of us in the room this morning that know him, our lives should be about priestly living,
[time=1181] priestly activity, priests who having met with God pass him and his attributes along to others
[time=1189] and God uses this to make it possible for others to then bring glory to him and this right there,
[time=1197] this is at the heart, we talked about this last week, it's at the very heart of this project that we
[time=1204] find ourselves jumping into here in the days to come, more than the project though, this is at the very heart of the kind of place and the kind of people we want to be about in the days
[time=1215] to come, a going, a willingness to be a priesthood on the move across the street, across the cubicle,
[time=1222] across town, across the country, across the world and I want to show you this morning,
[time=1228] this won't feel like maybe it won't seem like a message, kind of thought all week,
[time=1235] you know how to kind of make it somehow seem like a message and there are some real biblical truths in what I'm about to give you that I think are pertinent and important but there really was in any other way around this morning just feeling like we needed to give you, wanted to give you the
[time=1252] specifics of this project and so that's what I'm going to endeavor to do and I want to just if I
[time=1258] can just kind of walk you through when we talk about what cement impressions for life and we talk about needing you and wanting you as a family to help us pursue this endeavor, I want you to know
[time=1269] exactly what it is we're hoping to accomplish and and why and I want to say this to you up front,
[time=1276] this is not a list that got put together quickly over the last two years. Staff and elders have
[time=1283] been thinking and discussing and brainstorming and dialoguing and going back and forth and
[time=1289] praying again and just doing our very, very best to ask God what it is He would want for us to put
[time=1297] before this family as a dream, as a picture, as a vision for what it is we would love to see God
[time=1303] accomplish through us in the days to come. Specific endeavors that we believe could be used by God
[time=1311] as a tool to develop and establish priests, young and old, who would represent Him here and across
[time=1319] the world in ministry, in the marketplace, in Kenya, in the United States of America, in office
[time=1326] cubicles, in classrooms, wherever it is that we might go and so here I want to just give you these six components, what cement, these are six components and they are listed in order of
[time=1338] priority and I say that to you because a lot of people have asked when they've seen the material
[time=1344] they've asked are those things listed in any priority order and they are from the first one
[time=1350] to the sixth one, just as a leadership we've done our best collectively to say we feel as if
[time=1356] these in this order, these six would be our priority. So here we go, wet cement impressions for life,
[time=1364] the first component in the project, our hope is that we could raise as a family and as a ministry
[time=1371] through wet cement and three year above and beyond pledges, our hope is that we could raise enough
[time=1378] to eliminate all long-term debt, this would be really our highest priority at this time.
[time=1385] 2.2 million, that's what is in existence today, 2.2 million dollars in long-term debt
[time=1392] exists today by eliminating that, as it says here, we would permanently eliminate that
[time=1398] and free up $17,000 a month from our operating budget that will first provide us with a solid
[time=1406] financial foundation so that more resources in the future can be released to help our people
[time=1413] what say it, go absolutely. When they first told me that eliminating long-term debt would free up
[time=1420] $17,000 a month, my mouth almost hit the floor. What an amazing thing that would be over a quarter
[time=1426] million dollars a year. I want you to understand this long-term debt has been long-term, this isn't
[time=1432] debt that we've accumulated in recent years, this really truth be told kind of goes back a ways, actually quite a ways to some older projects that got done here in years gone by,
[time=1444] we just felt like it was time to do our very best to eliminate this, to kind of take this
[time=1450] out of play and free us up. We understand that, right? You understand that debt enslaves you. You know that, right? Who in the room has ever had any personal debt?
[time=1465] Go ahead, be honest. There you go. All of a sudden we're thinking of Visa cards and Master cards and I understand homes, you know, I understand cars to a degree but I mean there is this battle
[time=1476] that so many of us have faced and struggled with over the years. There is an enslavement, there is a bondage, there is a cloud that covers us when we are so absolutely in the whole
[time=1487] that we really can't do anything when things come along that we'd like to do, when opportunities present themselves that we'd love to pursue, we can't because we owe so much money, we can't even, in many cases, see straight. Proverbs 22, you can turn there.
[time=1504] If you'd like, Proverbs 22 just says it really, really clearly.
[time=1513] Says in Proverbs 22, 7. Says the rich rule over the poor, the rich rules over the poor and the
[time=1526] borrower becomes the lender's what? Say it, slave. It is an oppressive place to be. It is a debilitating
[time=1537] place to be. It is a discouraging place to be, to owe, to be in debt, to be in slave, to have
[time=1546] absolutely on the financial front, to have no freedom to do and to pursue and to invest in those
[time=1556] things that matter most. And while I'm very, very clear on the implications that debt has
[time=1562] personally in your life and in mine, I'm hoping you would be very clear as I am on the implications
[time=1569] it has to a ministry. When you think about the opportunities that God can bring us,
[time=1576] when you think about the opportunities that God's already brought us, when you think about over a quarter million dollars a year and what we could do with that, where that could be
[time=1586] invested, places that we could go, people that we could touch, needs that could get met. It's
[time=1593] really pretty exciting. And so that right there has just been something that from the get go we
[time=1599] have felt like was a number one priority, the elimination of all long-term debt, freeing up
[time=1606] about $17,000 a month. Now, as I talk through these six components, you're going to have questions,
[time=1612] I know. And so make sure you either come and talk to me afterwards, make sure that you take the time to talk with somebody on our team, make sure you go ahead and pencil it in to come on October 28th to the library down here. We'd be happy to talk through these things. I'm doing
[time=1627] my very best this morning to just kind of give you an overview that hopefully has enough specifics for you to be kind of tracking with us. Secondly, after the elimination of all long-term debt comes
[time=1639] the North Campus, our elementary school across the street, that building, all of it, a North Campus
[time=1645] renovation, a real upgrading of our North Campus property. Many of you in the room have been around
[time=1652] this place for a long time. You know how long that building has served us well. You know that it has been here in part. I mean, it all began over there and slowly it grew from over there and today we
[time=1664] find ourselves almost 40 years later with a building that while she has served us well, she is an
[time=1670] enormous need, really enormous need of repair. If we want to continue to try and attract families
[time=1678] to this opportunity, if we want to do our best to have a school that as far as it's technology and as far as it's aesthetics and as far as it's, I hate to say this, but it's, you know, it's security.
[time=1689] I mean, all across the board, in every arena, we need to continue to make improvements. That building just needs an enormous amount of them. From carpets to walls to windows to lighting to
[time=1701] computers to technology, there are some things we really, really want to do and this North Campus
[time=1707] renovation would allow us to do that in a way that we feel like would really make a difference.
[time=1711] We've talked in the past. There has been conversation about the possibility of maybe
[time=1717] selling that property, you know, letting a Walgreens come in and do their thing or whatever.
[time=1724] The thought though, while maybe interesting in some respects, when you think about them, the cost of building a brand new elementary school somewhere on this back campus, the cost of doing that versus the cost of doing a really solid refurbishing job on the current
[time=1741] facility, the difference there was enormous and so we're going to do our very best with your help.
[time=1747] To renovate and remodel and bring that campus to a state-of-the-art condition that we believe can serve us and future families for years to come.
[time=1757] So the elimination of all long-term debt, the renovation and remodeling of our North Campus,
[time=1764] and I want to just say this before we move on. Just, and I know maybe it goes without saying,
[time=1770] but I just can't tell you what it's like every day to be on that campus.
[time=1775] Every single day I sit in my office whenever I'm in my office as I sit there and I hear the kids
[time=1782] on the playground when the kickball bounces up against my window when I hear them out on the
[time=1788] playground when I walk the halls when I look in the rooms. Again, maybe it's just obvious to you, but to me it's something I thank God for every day. Those are real lives. Those are real little
[time=1800] ones with real families, real moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles and siblings, and we get this privilege every single day to make a purposeful investment in their life,
[time=1811] and I am so thankful that we get to do that and want nothing more than to continue to build into
[time=1817] and train up and encourage young priests who will go. I don't know where they'll end up going.
[time=1823] I am just so thankful that we're going to get the opportunity and privilege to shape and mold them to make an impression so that their going can be done with great purpose. So I'm thankful,
[time=1835] really, really grateful. Thirdly, let me show you this, West Wing addition. If you have your
[time=1841] compasses kind of going in your minds right now, you would understand this is the east end of our campus. God has been so gracious to us in the past through other projects. We were able to
[time=1851] see an addition, additions made to our east end. That's where our junior high and high school
[time=1857] are located. If you'll come over here in your mind's eye, right out through these doors is our west end
[time=1863] big patch of grass, and there is a lot. There really is. And if you sat me down and started asking me
[time=1870] all that I could envision, all that we could imagine, all that we would love to see take place
[time=1876] possibly on this west end. It's a lengthy list, but here's the deal. Truth be told, a lot of that
[time=1882] would be once. And we've tried to in this project make this initial addition to our west end here
[time=1890] really about need. We've tried to kind of hone and refine this picture to what would more than
[time=1896] likely be kind of a first phase, if you will, on our west end. And it's really, really about
[time=1903] kids, and it's really about families. It's really about our school and our church and the chance to
[time=1909] impact little lives, hopefully for a long, long time. This west wing provides expanded, safer
[time=1916] facilities for our growing preschool and our nursery and children's ministry program. So
[time=1923] obviously a great opportunity for our school and our church. It allows for additional rooms to
[time=1929] centralize all of our children's ministry programs on the same side of the street as what's going on
[time=1936] here in this room with adult ministries. This has been something we have wanted, something we have desired for a long, long time, and something we felt like at this time we needed a chance to bring all children's ministries to the south campus. You have no idea how discouraging it
[time=1952] is to watch visitors. Maybe you've, maybe you were that visitor at some point. Some stay, some just
[time=1958] leave when they get their coats off and get told they're going to need to put their coats back on, grab two of their four kids and walk them across the street and then come back to a 10-class church and then go back over when it's done. It's just a huge inconvenience that many of you have been willing, again, to live with, again for security reasons and for sensitivity to those that we're
[time=1980] trying to reach. We'd love to be able to provide a children's ministry facility on this side that
[time=1986] would meet their needs in a very, very encouraging way while also giving our growing preschool a
[time=1992] chance to even do more of that and I mean by that grow to expand. And so while this initial phase
[time=2000] would not encompass everything that we could do on a West Wing edition, we believe it represents some very specific needs as it relates to little ones that we'd really, really love to pursue. So that's the West Wing edition and you've got debt elimination, you've got the North
[time=2016] Campus refurbishing and then after the West Wing, we've got our Compassion Ministry Go Fund. I am
[time=2024] so grateful to be a part of a team. I'm so thankful to be a part of a place that was willing to do this.
[time=2029] This is something that I know each and every one of us on the team was so thankful for, a specific
[time=2036] fund that would be established through this Wet Cement Impressions for Life project. $300,000
[time=2043] if we can get there, $300,000 that would be set aside to provide funds for us to send you
[time=2050] to go wherever it is that you might need to go. Wherever it is that we might need to or want to
[time=2056] send you, we believe that financially. Again, I know how this works so many times you and I
[time=2062] have had opportunities to go whether it's a medical missions trip, whether it's a sports
[time=2068] ministries outreach to somewhere across the world, whether it's been a high school missions trip to West Virginia or New York. I mean, there are opportunities to go where it gets discouraging for me is to see how the cost of that trip so many times is a deterrent for people who would love
[time=2085] to go or we tell people it's going to cost you $2,100 and so then they go home and write what?
[time=2090] They go home and write letters as they should and they send letters to you and to me as they should
[time=2097] and all of a sudden there is kind of the core of this family being faced with financial decisions on whether we should give our gift to the offerings that we split up our offering gift and give some to the trip. I mean, it's a very, very difficult thing at times and we feel like I feel like even biblically I feel like we should as a leadership if we're going to send you, I think we should send you. I think we should help especially those of you that need the help, especially those of you that would be encouraged by the help financially and this fund would allow us to send you and the
[time=2129] $17,000 a month freed up by the elimination of all long-term debt provides. In time, I think initially
[time=2137] we'll kind of re-strengthen and rebuild our financial underpinnings but once we've done that,
[time=2143] the $17,000 a month could go to things like this, the replenishing of our compassion ministry go fund.
[time=2152] I think about Matthew 25 when I think about this fund. I think about how Jesus referred to the least
[time=2158] of these. I think about those who are dying of AIDS. I think about those who are hungry in Fort Wayne.
[time=2165] I think about those who don't have appropriate clothing. I think about those who are dying because they have no water to drink. I think about the hundreds of thousands and millions of people in this
[time=2176] world, many of whom are within our reach that we could help. We could come alongside. We could
[time=2183] make a difference. God could make a difference through our efforts and we would love nothing more than
[time=2189] to have a fund that would allow us to send you to join us in those endeavors. Next on the list,
[time=2197] after the compassion ministry fund is a practice gym. Steve Wild, our athletic director, would tell
[time=2203] you we have over 21, 22 athletic teams currently using the two gyms. It's a lot of teams and those
[time=2211] aren't just games. Those are practices that need to be scheduled. You get practices scheduled and games scheduled. Then you work into the equation. We use those gyms as multi-purpose rooms for ministry here. You get children's ministries and student ministries and adult ministries trying to get access to those two gyms you throw in on top of that that we use those gyms for our high school fine arts, our fall play and our spring musical. When the fall play or the spring musical
[time=2238] are taking place, they use one of those gyms which leaves just one gym. It's an absolute nightmare.
[time=2245] We've been surviving. We've had kids waking up at five in the morning to go to six o'clock practices and some kids practicing until nine, nine 30 at night. We could keep doing it but we felt like this was an opportunity because we care about the athletic endeavor here. We care
[time=2261] about the fine arts endeavor here. We realize those young men and young women are priests in the making and we want to provide them the best opportunity we can, the most reasonable one, and it would be reasonable in our minds today to have a third practice gym. It's not an arena.
[time=2276] It's not a big fancy deal. It's going to be a real nice glorified athletic pole barn that's
[time=2282] going to get the job done and as you can see the big glorified pole barn does cost a little bit of
[time=2288] money but we'll do our best and we'll see what God allows us to experience there with the practice
[time=2294] gym. Last on the list, BCS satellite opportunity and here's what I want to say to you about this.
[time=2301] It has been amazing really over the last two, three years. I've been approached personally three times, three times by individuals or organizations, actually churches to be honest with you.
[time=2314] We've been approached three times by churches who have asked if we would ever be willing to
[time=2321] in their location and it just so happened that these three were southeast, southwest, and northwest
[time=2328] and they wondered if we would ever be willing to take what we've done with our elementary school and provide kind of, they said there's no reason to reinvent the wheel. You guys have a remarkable
[time=2339] reputation. You obviously, God's given you an ability to do this. Would you ever think about coming to our place, bringing your school, bringing a staff, bringing that program and doing a
[time=2350] Blackhawk Christian satellite location on our site and we have said you know what we'll think about
[time=2356] that. We have said you know what we'll pray about that. We have said you know what we'll consider
[time=2362] doing some studies. We'll consider collecting data. We'll consider taking some community surveys
[time=2370] and the amount that you see on the screen there would allow us to do those very things, to give thought to and consideration to the possibility someday of possibly having this privileged
[time=2381] opportunity of raising and establishing little priests in all four quadrants of our city.
[time=2388] Don't know exactly how that will go but we're very, very open to considering that.
[time=2393] So there you have it. Those are the six components of what cement and I think most of
[time=2401] you know me well enough to know that I would not stand here and run you through all of that if I didn't believe deep in my heart that it was compelling, that it was something that I felt like
[time=2413] God had directed us toward. I stand here in absolute integrity and honesty before you
[time=2421] on this one my friends and I'm telling you that I think it was entitled, I don't know if you saw it, it was entitled The Dream and you might say well that's an awfully big dream. I mean you look at the size of our ministry and you might say my goodness 7.5 million dollars that just seems
[time=2438] enormous. Well you know what it is. It is absolutely enormous. It is a big dream and I have no idea
[time=2447] what our big God is going to do is we watch him work in you and as he continues to work in us,
[time=2455] I have no idea where there's things going to land but I want to say a few things to you this morning.
[time=2460] Before we let you go I really want to have you hear me say just a few things. It's very important
[time=2467] to me that you hear this and I hope you'll, I told first hour I hope you'll gossip about this.
[time=2472] I hope you'll just run your mouths a thousand miles an hour and tell everybody you bump into that we said this because this is really, really how we feel and this is really, really what I want to say to you this morning about this project. That is a big number but I want you to understand
[time=2489] that we will not be, hear me, we will not. I am not, I am not and our team is not and I don't want
[time=2497] you to be preoccupied with that number because this isn't about that number. We at Blackhawk are
[time=2505] preoccupied with people. We are preoccupied with ministry. We are preoccupied with trying to be a
[time=2513] people for God's own possession that having met with him are deeply committed to going and
[time=2519] passing him along to others. We think these elements give us an opportunity to further that.
[time=2525] How much of this dream, how many of these components are actually going to be realized,
[time=2532] I don't know. We might end up raising four. He could bring ten. You realize that, don't you?
[time=2538] You realize that? You realize he could do whatever he wants with this but I'm asking you this.
[time=2545] Here's what I'm asking you today. We're going to ask you on November 11th. We're going to ask
[time=2553] everybody that calls this place home on November 11th to come and bring a commitment
[time=2561] to have prayerfully thought through between now and then a pledge, a three year above and beyond
[time=2569] commitment from deep in your heart to help us further the scope and reach of this ministry.
[time=2577] Here's what I'm asking. I'm asking every one of you to prayerfully consider the most sacrificial
[time=2583] significant gift you've ever made. I believe it's worth it. I believe what this could posture us
[time=2594] for. I believe the people will get to reach. I believe the people will get to meet. I think the places will get to go. I think the lives that we'll get to touch. I think it's worth my
[time=2606] kebra and eyes and our kid, we've already started talking about it with our kids, the most sacrificial,
[time=2612] the most significant gift we could possibly make. And I'm asking you, every one of you, young and old,
[time=2619] I'm asking those of you that make an enormous amount of money. I'm asking those of you that hardly make any at all. I'm asking those of you who have multiple, multiple upon multiple accounts
[time=2631] and savings and this and that and portfolios. And I'm asking those of you who are wondering about
[time=2637] dinner tonight. I'm asking every single one of us to prayerfully consider the most sacrificial
[time=2647] significant gift you've ever made because I think this is worth it. And I want to make
[time=2653] sure you understand something. I am not talking about equal amounts. We're not interested in equal
[time=2659] amounts. We're interested in equal what? Sacrifice. And I am asking you to do that.
[time=2667] I'm asking you to consider a sacrificial significant gift and here's the deal. If you'll promise me,
[time=2676] well, strike that. If you'll make a commitment before God, I will. And if you'll make a commitment
[time=2685] before God to do that, to prayerfully consider that, you know what? I'm going to be great
[time=2691] with however that we're going to be great with however this thing turns out.
[time=2697] If it's three, if it's five, if it's seven, we are not preoccupied with the what? With the number.
[time=2704] If you'll promise to partner with us on this thing and do your very best, if we really did our very
[time=2712] best, then the glass, and you know me, the glass is always half what? It's half full. You know,
[time=2718] it's more than half full. We're going to be great. I bump into guys at pastor's conferences. I'll bump into peers of mine. It retreats. I'll go to an all inevitably. I'll bump into a guy with his head down and his shoulders drooped and his countenance completely shot. And I can tell you what he's
[time=2734] going to say to me. I'm going to say, hey, Greg, how you doing? He's going to say, oh, we had a, he's going to be like talking to Eor. We had a building campaign. We missed our number.
[time=2744] You know, the guy's spirits, the guy's attitude completely shot because he, because he missed,
[time=2751] because they missed their mark. And I want you to understand that for me, for us in this endeavor, the mark's not the seven, five. The mark is our very best effort to collectively as a family.
[time=2765] I told you a few weeks ago that this was in the end going to be about ownership. And who really, who really wants to do this? Who really wants to take all the chips and shove them into the middle
[time=2776] of the table and say, you know what? I'm in. I am completely in to the degree that I can be
[time=2782] completely in. I'm in. I want to put my arms around this place and these people and be a part of
[time=2788] something that God is doing. And so I want to make sure you realize that. I said a three year
[time=2797] above and beyond commitment. I want to say this to you as well. When you think about a three year above and beyond commitment, so many times in our minds, we just think, my goodness, I don't have, I don't know how I can do this. Believe me, these are the, these are the words I hear myself saying,
[time=2814] I don't know how I can do this. It's not like I live month to month storing and putting aside
[time=2820] thousands and thousands of dollars. And I just, I've talked with guys who have done this. I've
[time=2827] been through this process before and learned some things. And I want to just, I want to just kind of get you thinking about. And we're not trying to close this thing today. I just want you to begin to think about some things that might, if you're willing, might help you think this through in a
[time=2844] way that really might begin to provide some traction in your heart and your mind. Here's what I mean.
[time=2850] When you think about a three year above and beyond commitment to something that's so significant and
[time=2856] matters as much as this does, let me ask you this. What would you, what would you be willing not to buy
[time=2864] in the next three years? I mean it. What would you be willing not to buy? What purchase or purchases
[time=2877] they add up, right? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. All right. They add up. Some you have to make,
[time=2891] right? Right. Some you don't. Right? All right. What, what would you be willing
[time=2900] not to buy over a three year span or a portion of a three year span in an effort to before God
[time=2909] creatively think through God, how could I give to this? What, what would you be willing to sell?
[time=2918] I don't want you, I don't want you going homeless on me. I'm not saying move your family into a tent down at headwaters, okay? I mean if you feel led to do that talk to me and we'll, we'll try and
[time=2930] steer you a different direction, but you know, but what would you be willing to part with?
[time=2934] Really? What do you have that, I don't know, maybe you don't really need, maybe when you before
[time=2947] God begin to compare it with the opportunities that I, what would you be willing to sell?
[time=2952] What aggressive out of the ordinary savings approach might you be willing to engage in?
[time=2962] What trip? What trip or trips will you not take over a three year span in order to just save and
[time=2973] put aside, you know, just a certain amount of money? Again, I know most of you aren't taking
[time=2980] thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars every month and going, gee, I wonder what I should do with this? But when you start thinking about your life and when you just start thinking about
[time=2990] what your year looks like, what trip or trips could you maybe not take in an effort to give?
[time=2996] What paper route? What paper? I'm just giving you some idea. What paper route?
[time=3002] Might you as a young person be willing to go out and it's been amazing to already hear stories
[time=3008] of young people in our church who have already caught the vision for this thing, thinking of jobs they can go and get, jobs that they could go and get, work that they could do
[time=3019] over a three year span and donate all that to something that matters, something that's compelling
[time=3025] and significant in the kingdom? What creative ideas, those of you that lead in your homes,
[time=3032] what creative ideas will you help your family come up with in an effort to pursue a sacrificial
[time=3038] and significant gift? Well, we'll leave it at that for today and I want to ask Corbin and Eric,
[time=3046] if they'd come, they're going to sing a song. It's one of my favorites and it's a song that has so much to say to the very things we've been discussing this morning. I pray and I hope that you'll listen
[time=3056] and I pray and I hope that as you think about your commitment, here is a personal commitment
[time=3064] guide. By the way, you got these in your packet and I hope as you think about your commitment, I hope as you continue to come back each week over these next three or four weeks and as we keep talking about this, I really hope and pray that you'd give some thought, not so much to the
[time=3079] project, but to this incredible opportunity that God has given us to help people go, to help young people and older people, be a people who are willing because there are so
[time=3090] many opportunities, my friends, that God has given you and I. I really hope and I really pray
[time=3096] that your heart would be open to a going, a willingness to pass along him to others. This is a song
[time=3103] you've got to kind of got to stand up on. So would you stand and just don't go yet, just hang around.
[time=3133] The heavens and she wonders, is there something home? Never been told the name of Jesus. She turns and
[time=3145] walks away. What a shame.
[time=3148] Just across the street in your hometown leaving from his magnified.
[time=3163] Gazing down the road, he wonders, is this all there is to life. Never been told the name of Jesus.
[time=3174] Ten years on his way. What a shame. Oh yeah.
[time=3187] Who shall I serve? Who will go for me? To the ends of the earth, who will rise up for his king?
[time=3201] Here am I, send me. Here am I, send me.
[time=3225] Whether for in land or in neighbor. Everyone's the same. Searching for the answers.
[time=3236] The lie within your head. I want to proclaim the love of Jesus. In all I do and say,
[time=3247] on a shame. Oh yeah. Who shall I serve? Who will go for me? To the ends of the earth, who will rise up
[time=3269] for the king? Here am I, send me. Here am I, send me.
[time=3288] How beautiful are the feet of those, bring good news, proclaiming peace and your salvation.
[time=3299] Who shall I serve? Who will go for me? To the ends of the earth, who will rise up for the king?
[time=3317] Here am I, send me. Here am I, send me. Here am I, send me.
[time=3347] Hey, would you just bow your heads and pray with me? Would your Father God, we would just echo
[time=3374] the words to that song. We would make that our declaration as we leave this place today.
[time=3379] God those of us that know you want to be willing to go, so send us. God send us into tomorrow
[time=3387] with real purpose, with eyes to see opportunities to serve. God send us across the street even this
[time=3395] afternoon. God send us out the back door to the family that lives behind us. God send us down the
[time=3401] block to the difficult neighbor. God allow us and give us strength and courage to be a
[time=3408] people willing to go into the marketplace tomorrow. In the classroom with our team, wherever it is,
[time=3415] you have us. God allow us to go there with a heart willing to pass you along to others.
[time=3421] And God remind us today that we can't pass you along unless we know you,
[time=3427] unless we spend time with you, unless we marvel each and every day, unless we bask in your goodness
[time=3435] and in your truth. God, unless we meet with you, we'll have nothing to give. So God,
[time=3441] I pray that you'd help us on all fronts. And as we pursue this project, you've got this opportunity
[time=3447] for ministry now and tomorrow. God, I pray to give us wisdom. Pray that you allow us to face any
[time=3455] fears that we might have. God, I pray that we would get beyond our own world and that which we want,
[time=3462] that which we might think we deserve. God, I pray that we would be so very willing to be like you,
[time=3469] generous in our giving. And God, we'll thank you for it. We'll thank you as we watch you do great things
[time=3478] in and prove an opportunity like this and all the people who read and said
[time=3508] "I'm not going to be like you, I'm not going to be like you, I'm not going to be like you."
