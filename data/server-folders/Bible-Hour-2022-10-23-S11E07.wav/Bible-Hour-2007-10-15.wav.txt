[time=0] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[time=16] and on earth." Therefore, go and make disciples of allness, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[time=28] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=38] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to
[time=44] the end of the age.
[time=49] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=56] There is a name far above all others, Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=70] There is a name that makes evil shutter, Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=75] Sing it by her now.
[time=77] There is a name far above all others, Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=83] Yeah.
[time=84] There is a name that makes evil shutter, Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=88] Your name.
[time=93] Jesus, Your name, will endure.
[time=94] Your name.
[time=139] Jesus, Your name, will endure.
[time=140] Your name.
[time=146] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=151] He will write his name for us.
[time=154] We will worship him forever.
[time=159] Blessed be.
[time=165] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=168] Forever, forever, forever, forever.

[time=199] Oh, yeah.
[time=207] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=282] (audience applauding) - Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor of Black Hawk Ministries, and I wanna thank you for joining us in the middle of our series, "Wet cement." You know, I used to sit where you're sitting, owning a business several years ago, and wondering why preachers always talked about giving money, but spent very little time about teaching what the Bible says about earning money, kind of the wisdom or the street smarts on how you earn it in a way that honors God.
[time=316] So today and next week, we're entering in a talk
[time=322] of what I see as a pattern in Proverbs.
[time=325] Proverbs means generally true most of the time, and it's about wisdom.
[time=330] Wisdom, the Hebrew word for wisdom is hokma, and it's the intersection of the vertical with the horizontal.
[time=336] It's how to make sense of the up and down the vertical, my relationship with God, with my circumstances, and to have street smarts horizontally, and how I combine people and tasks and get along in this world and be in it, but not of it.
[time=353] So we're gonna talk about the ins and outs and the ups and downs of the resources of life, because as I've studied this, I've realized that it's not just our treasures, but it includes our time and our talent as well.
[time=368] The three resources of life, our time, our talent, our treasures, and all of that we know from what the Bible says flows from the heart, 'cause it's the wellspring of life.
[time=381] Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and He'll make your paths straight.
[time=384] Your life flows from your heart.
[time=388] So we're gonna take a look in the next two weeks on what comprises a generous heart, a generous heart.
[time=395] And today, we're gonna take a look at the ins and outs of life's resources.
[time=401] We're gonna look on how it should come in, on how God is our provider, and how it should go out, how the resources go out, that they should reflect that God is our passion.
[time=414] And I kinda like literations, so we're gonna have 10 Ws over the courses of the next two Sundays, kind of a list you might just wanna jot down on a pad of paper, on your laptop as you watch, and kinda assimilate those Ws, those handles, those practices, those wise practices for life that come from God's word, that I'm telling you will make a difference in your life, on how you earn, on how you spend, on how you save, on what you do when times are bad, and the resources go down.
[time=449] What I'm gonna share with Kelly over the next two Sundays, has impacted my personal life as much as anything, probably that I've ever studied.
[time=459] So thank you so much for joining us, and we hope that you see every opportunity, when you lock eyes with another human being has an opportunity of what cement to make an impression for life.
[time=473] - Psalm 145 says this, "One generation will commend your works to another, "and they will tell of your mighty acts." And we want to be a generation that is faithful to doing that, to commending his works and declaring his mighty acts to the generation that follows.
[time=490] I wanna invite Tom Cashin and his friend to the stage.
[time=493] Now Tom is gonna lead us in a time of prayer this morning, but he's gonna introduce us first to a friend of his, someone from the generation that will follow him.
[time=502] Tom has been gifted with a spiritual gift of discipleship, and he's been faithfully commending God's works to other generations, and we thought it would be good for you to see an example of this, and then they're gonna lead us in a time of corporate prayer today.
[time=516] Tom.
[time=517] - Thank you, Corbin.
[time=518] My name is Tom Cashin.
[time=519] I was just thinking a few moments ago, my wife Carol and I have been involved in this church for 30 years, 30.
[time=526] I don't like to think those thoughts, but I see some other 30-year folks out there, and we've all learned that it's about generations.
[time=536] One generation comes and goes, and we have a mandate to move on and pass it on to the next generation.
[time=544] The theme of this service is about that kind of thing, and I wanna introduce you to one of the guys in the next generation that I've gotten to know.
[time=553] This is Cameron Ginder.
[time=556] Cam is a high school guy.
[time=557] He's a junior at Carroll High School, and Cam and I have been involved in some things together.
[time=564] They've been exciting and great things, but Cam, I wanna ask, you know, what's the deal?
[time=568] Not a whole lot of your peers are hanging out with portly, balding, slightly used Spanish teachers, okay?
[time=578] And you and I just seems like we are spending increasing more and more time together doing things.
[time=585] Could you talk to the folks about what that looks like?
[time=588] - I met Mr. Cash in an eighth grade.
[time=592] I was fortunate enough to have him in Spanish class, and the summer of eighth grade, I was able to go on the raft trip, and that's when our relationship started to grow, and more than just a student, teacher, and do a relationship with Christ.
[time=610] Then, not much happened that summer after the raft trip.
[time=614] It was pretty busy, and then two years ago, again, I went on the raft trip, and I really expressed to Mr. Cash and how I wanted to be a part of a small group so that could help me grow in Christ, and that sort of took off, and Mr. Cash in it was fortunate enough to take a hold of a group that I was a part of, and really get that going.
[time=633] And then this summer, again, I went on the raft trip, and it's even grown more in depth since then.
[time=640] You know, Cam, you know that verse in what is it?
[time=644] It's Luke 6 that says that a student is not above his teacher, but when he is fully trained, he'll be like his teacher, and honestly, when I saw you get out of the car this morning with your haircut like that way, I thought maybe you've gone a little far in this whole thing, but, you know, he's a high school kid, they do that.
[time=667] Cam, you mentioned a small group.
[time=670] Blackhawk is committed, I mean radically committed to this passing on and acknowledging God's works to the next generation.
[time=678] Talk a little bit about the small group.
[time=680] We meet on Tuesday nights and spend a couple hours together, but help folks know what that kind of looks like 'cause there are a lot of people here involved in similar things, and they'll smile along with you.
[time=690] What's small group to you?
[time=692] - Every Tuesday night we meet for about two hours, sometimes a little longer, we go to a friend's house and just sit in a circle in the basement, and for the first half hour or 45 minutes, we don't get a lot accomplished, we just sort of eat and hang out, and then Mr. Cashin informs us we've done nothing and we need to sort of get down to business, so we sort of meet there, and it's just an important time that we meet week for me, I'm able to grow and have fun and just fellowship with other kids who have the same ideas and beliefs as I do, and I think it's worth it for that night to stay up a little later and do homework, so I get to do that for two hours.
[time=728] - Cam, I remember the first time I saw you,
[time=737] I didn't have a clue you were, but you were in the cafeteria there with some of your friends, and you were a sixth grader, and it's been great to watch how God has caused this thing to develop to where you were a student, now you're my friend, and quickly becoming a partner in advancing the kingdom of God, Cam and I are gonna pray together for you.
[time=762] As I said, our church, we're blessed that our church has an aggressive vision here about transmitting the wonderful things of God to the next generation, our Sunday school ministry is huge, Black Hawk Christian School is a dynamic and dramatic ministry that promotes this very thing, and what we've decided to do, Cam's gonna pray for the young people in that formula for the next generation, I'm gonna pray for all of us that are involved in that, so let's bow our heads together, go before the Lord, and pray about generations.
[time=799] - Dear Lord, I just first off wanna thank you for Mr. Cash and the blessing that he's been to me and all my friends that are a part of the small group, and secondly, I wanna pray for all the other teenagers who don't exactly have what I have with Mr. Cash and don't have that kind of relationship, and I would hope that you would open their eyes to see what a true blessing and what a true help it is to have someone like Mr. Cash and pass down all of his knowledge that he has, Lord, please just help people to see how much of a great thing that truly is.
[time=838] - And Father, I wanna pray for those of us in the upper generations.
[time=845] I wanna pray for a huge dose of your grace to move us into places where we can invest our lives in redemptive relationships.
[time=857] We can find ways to take the accumulated knowledge and experience that you've given us, and transmit it to the ones who are coming along.
[time=867] Lord, we're not in it for just now.
[time=870] We're in it for eternity, and we commend ourselves to that.
[time=874] Lord, I know that there are folks out there that are considering, have been thinking and sitting on the bubble, should I get involved in working with the Sunday school?
[time=882] Should I get involved in one of these small groups that they talk about?
[time=888] Teenagers drive me crazy.
[time=890] Well, Lord, they drive me crazy too, but what an opportunity it's been and what an honor.
[time=896] We are grateful to be part of such a church, such a mission, part of such a great God.
[time=903] It's in his son's name we pray.
[time=905] [AMEN] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor,
[time=925] here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I wanna thank you for your interest in wet cement, impressions for life.
[time=932] It is an incredible project that we are so very looking forward to, and I can't wait for you to learn more about it.
[time=939] Let me ask you a question.
[time=941] What is it about wet cement that is so inviting?
[time=944] What is it about a freshly poured driveway or sidewalk that is so compelling for you and me?
[time=950] I tell you what I think it is.
[time=951] I think the thought of placing our hand or our feet in that driveway or sidewalk, really the thought of leaving an impression.
[time=960] I think that's something that you and I connect with.
[time=963] I think it's something that we were made for.
[time=965] I think the idea of kind of leaving a memorial that says for years and years and years to come, I was here.
[time=973] I think there's something really special about that.
[time=975] And I tell you what, at Black Hawk for almost 40 years, that's what's been going on.
[time=979] Back to the very beginning, in the days of Dr. David Jeremiah and those faithful few that met in that trailer, this ministry has been characterized by that.
[time=988] Our church and our school for years, loving this opportunity God has given us to make impressions, to shape and mold hearts, young hearts and old hearts alike.
[time=1000] It has been an incredible privilege and wet cement impressions for life, this project that you're gonna learn more about gives us a chance to really further that legacy, to further invest in young lives, to further shape and mold, not only people and students for today, but a future generation of people whose hearts and lives will impact generations to come.
[time=1024] I'm so thankful for the part I get to play in this.
[time=1027] I hope that you'll join us in participating.
[time=1030] I hope you'll help us leave a memorial for years to come.
[time=1034] It says clearly to those in the future, we were here.
[time=1039] So what are the specific components of wet cement?
[time=1046] And more importantly, how will the components of this project produce impressions for life here and across the world?
[time=1053] Freeing up nearly $17,000 a month
[time=1059] through debt elimination provides black cock with a mechanism that will create a stronger financial base for our future, rebuild cash reserves and develop a funding source for new ministry opportunities, both locally and globally.
[time=1073] Renovating our North Campus will bring new life to an almost 40 year old facility that has served us well.
[time=1079] Our elementary campus will be better prepared to reach future priests with a completely remodeled state of the art facility.
[time=1086] From security upgrades to an improved performing arts venue, the new North Campus will posture us for years to come to both educate and inspire our students.
[time=1096] A West Wing addition to our existing worship center facility will allow our already growing preschool to expand and connect with even more young lives and their families in the days to come.
[time=1107] A kid-friendly facility like this will also allow for all our Sunday morning children's ministries to take place on one side of the street.
[time=1115] No more trips across State Street with little ones on those cold January mornings.
[time=1120] Establishing a Compassion Ministries Go Fund opens up numerous possibilities for us to send our people and our resources into a world desperate for our health.
[time=1130] Whether in Fort Wayne, the Luxy, or Kenya, we will have new financial capacity to go into all the world.
[time=1137] A new practice gym brings obvious and much needed relief to the overcrowded and oftentimes frustrating world of team sports at BCS.
[time=1147] Currently, we have over 20 athletic teams trying to practice in our two existing gyms.
[time=1152] We desperately need the space.
[time=1155] Creating a fund to potentially grow Blackhawk Christian School through new satellite locations in Fort Wayne opens up even more educational and spiritual opportunities to reach the next generation of this community.
[time=1168] (upbeat music) - I think Blackhawk School prepared me professionally
[time=1176] for my career now, which I'm a physician here in town, by teaching me just discipline.
[time=1182] Discipline in academics, studying hard and just putting those principles into practice now even has helped my practice.
[time=1190] - Well, my experience at Blackhawk taught me that I should strive to do the best at everything that I do and that I should always try to achieve excellence in what I do but that I should not do that for my own glory but I should do that for the glory of God and I should just be a witness for him as I'm out there in the marketplace and I try to do that all the time.
[time=1210] - The relationships that formed back 20 years ago now for me are still in existence today and it's completely changed and yet as my kids go here now, I can see that the dynamics of the school are still the same.
[time=1223] The fundamentals of the school haven't changed even though it's bigger today.
[time=1226] - Vaughn and I are really excited to think back what Blackhawk did for our own children, Stephen, Brian and Karen.
[time=1234] We were particularly excited about what the school did in terms of having all Christian teachers and how the teachers cared for the children and reinforced what Vaughn and I were trying to teach at home.
[time=1246] - Seven to eight months ago, Pastor Bird did a series on I am a priest and I'm happy to see Blackhawk Ministries really view Blackhawk Christian school and it's 750 students as little priests and I'm encouraged when I have my kids go into the nursery and I look inside and I see my students in there leading my children in nursery and seeing them being willing to be a servant.
[time=1280] - I've been an elder at Blackhawk Church for about a year now and I've been encouraged with the direction of the leadership of Blackhawk in particular how we're looking at our congregation as priests and how we're developing disciples of Christ that will be prepared here and impact their local communities and that can be here in Fort Wayne, clear over in Kenya, Russia, wherever God means.
[time=1308] - Well, I wanna thank you for watching the DVD.
[time=1313] I hope you feel educated, informed, I hope down deep inside, I hope you feel inspired.
[time=1318] I am so looking forward to what's ahead for us and as I think about maybe what I'd like to leave you with I wanna just say this to you.
[time=1326] There is with wet cement, impressions for life, a pretty huge dollar amount that's been attached to this thing and yet what I would wanna talk to you about here isn't so much a dollar figure, it's really about your heart and I'd like to ask you to do two things.
[time=1342] First of all, I'd like you to pray.
[time=1344] There is so much wisdom and discernment needed in this.
[time=1349] As we communicate this to our family, as we share this with our school constituency, there is so much prayer that is needed that we would do this in a way that would really honor God and I wanna ask you, would you pray for us?
[time=1362] Would you pray for me?
[time=1364] Would you pray for our leaders as we do our very best to present this in a way that would make much of him and allow people to connect with the vision behind it?
[time=1374] Secondly, I wanna ask you this, would you be willing to, at the heart level, make the most significant commitment you've ever made?
[time=1383] I'm asking my wife, my kids, our staff, our elders, I'm asking everybody I know to do that, to be willing to this time, make the most significant gift you've ever made.
[time=1395] I think when I look at this project, I think it's worth it.
[time=1398] I think there is so much at stake.
[time=1400] There is so much on the line and I want to with our three-year pledges that I want you and I to be willing to make a significant pledge.
[time=1409] I hope you'll pray about it and I hope you'll consider it.
[time=1412] I'm thankful for you and I can't wait to see what God will do.
[time=1416] (upbeat music) - Week three in our attempt to do our very best,
[time=1431] to communicate with you as a family, the opportunity that we believe God has given us with what's cement, an opportunity to make impressions for life, not just today, but for years and years to come.
[time=1443] And we talked early on week one about how this is really not about a building, it's not about money, it's really about trying to further a mindset of priests who are willing to reflect God to others.
[time=1456] Priests who are willing to do that as they go, as they move forward into the opportunities that he brings.
[time=1462] I want to just remind you from what you just heard this morning in the water.
[time=1466] Those stories that you just heard, I want to just remind you, there was a father who was willing to be a priest.
[time=1471] I want to remind you, those of you who sit in this room on a Sunday morning, somebody pulled into a visitor's parking space and somebody was willing to be a priest.
[time=1480] It really matters.
[time=1483] Your sensitivity in mind to those that God brings our way, he brings people your way in the everyday of life.
[time=1489] We have opportunities every day to have our priestly antenna up.
[time=1493] Here on a Sunday morning, somebody pulls into a spot and we've got someone going and giving a greeting and helping people feel welcomed.
[time=1500] It is everywhere you are, these opportunities, to pass along God to others.
[time=1506] And we're thankful that we get to be a part of it as a family.
[time=1509] Today, we're going to begin a discussion.
[time=1512] This will be a two week discussion about something that I think is really important for us to consider as we think about our, not only our contribution to a project, but also just the way we flat out approach life.
[time=1529] And that is, we want to talk to you today about generosity.
[time=1535] I've talked to you about being priests that get God all over you.
[time=1538] I've talked about getting His kindness all over you.
[time=1541] We've talked about getting His compassion all over you.
[time=1547] There's so many attributes.
[time=1549] I want to remind you this morning that our God, my friends, and Mitch is going to tell us a little bit about this as we jump in here this morning.
[time=1555] He's a generous, generous God.
[time=1559] And I want for you and I the privilege of drawing near to Him and understanding more and more what it means to, in our response then to others, be generous people.
[time=1570] And I can't wait to have you learn more about it this morning.
[time=1573] - Well, what's it mean to have a generous heart, to have a heart that's gracious, a heart that has Paul wrote to Timothy that's generous and willing to share?
[time=1583] I took a look at this in Proverbs because I sat where you sat and sometimes it was on the other end of a television screen in a hotel room watching a church service.
[time=1594] And I heard preachers and pastors talk a lot about giving money.
[time=1599] And usually they were on the receiving end.
[time=1603] But as I was studying the Bible for myself and applying it to my own life in business, I was experiencing a more holistic approach on what the Bible has to say about resources in life.
[time=1615] Three resources in life are time, our talent, and our treasures.
[time=1621] And they flow from the heart.
[time=1623] The heart is the wellspring of life.
[time=1626] The heart is our mind, our will, our emotions, and our spirits with our mind that we have our thoughts, our will that we have our choices, our emotions that we have our feelings or our affections, and our spirit that we have our prayers or lack of them.
[time=1639] And so a generous heart actually leads to what happens then with our time, talent, and treasures.
[time=1648] Proverbs, a book of wisdom in the Bible, means generally true most of the time.
[time=1654] So they're these interesting sayings that generally true most of the time in our lives will either be on the foolish side of the equation or we can be on the wise side of the equation.
[time=1665] And wisdom, you've heard me say this before, is the intersection of the vertical with the horizontal.
[time=1671] It's the sweet spot of where the vertical, my relationship with God, God's heart, intersects with the horizontal street smarts.
[time=1680] How to make sense in my circumstances, my tasks and my relationships with other people.
[time=1686] So again, hokma in Hebrew, the Hebrew word for wisdom, is God's heart intersecting with street smarts.
[time=1693] It's applying God's heart and making it sticky to my circumstances.
[time=1698] And so here's what's kind of interesting.
[time=1700] We talked away there in Proverbs 3.34 is this verse that New Testament writers refer to so they must have deemed it rather important.
[time=1709] And it's that God is gracious.
[time=1713] God gives grace to the humble.
[time=1718] God opposes the proud.
[time=1722] Now what's I have to do with what's cement?
[time=1726] What's cement is our way of saying, impressions for life is our way of saying that we see every encounter, not as an interruption, but as a divine appointment.
[time=1734] And that heart can be what's cement and we have an opportunity to make an impression for life.
[time=1741] An impression for life in two ways.
[time=1743] One that it's applicable to life.
[time=1746] And then for life, as in lifetime, that it's eternal, applicable and eternal.
[time=1753] And here's the irony of it all.
[time=1755] We will not be making impressions for life in everyone we lock eyes with unless our hearts are first what's cement toward the God of the universe.
[time=1769] Our hearts must be humbled to the wise one.
[time=1772] So what we're gonna look at over the next two weeks are the ins and outs of God's resources, time, talent, treasures.
[time=1780] How God has designed a generous heart for those resources to come in and for those resources to go out.
[time=1786] And that's what we'll focus on today.
[time=1787] And the next week will be the ups and the downs.
[time=1791] How God has designed it when we get a little ahead of it and the resources are built up.
[time=1795] And then what God's design is for a generous heart when resources go down.
[time=1799] And kinda to help you learn it, we have 10 words that each begin with a letter W to help you develop a pattern to learn this and assimilate it into your life.
[time=1810] So you're gonna get 10 Ws.
[time=1812] First we're gonna look at the end on how a generous heart takes in God's resources.
[time=1817] And I'm pulling from what scholars or theologians would call the sevenfold centrality of the Lord on a characteristic of God's heart that we see on the end, on the out, on the up, on the down.
[time=1830] So on the end, this is in Proverbs 16, the first seven verses of that.
[time=1834] On the end, there's this idea that we see that God is my provider.
[time=1837] It's Proverbs 16, three.
[time=1839] Yahweh, Yahri, or Jehovah, Jaira.
[time=1842] There was even a name in the Old Testament for God who continued to provide.
[time=1846] God is the provider of my time, talent and treasures.
[time=1849] It says commit to the Lord, whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.
[time=1854] If your heart is what cement to God, to the Lord, the person of God, then your plans will succeed.
[time=1862] He will provide.
[time=1864] And so the first W that you're gonna get is win.
[time=1867] Win is how we earn it.
[time=1869] So write it down, win little by little.
[time=1874] We get our time, a ticket of time, a second at a time.
[time=1878] It's kinda interesting, isn't it?
[time=1880] Our talent seems to develop and to grow kind of a ticket of time.
[time=1886] And God's designed it that also that money, treasures would flow into our lives, kind of a tick at a time.
[time=1895] Proverbs 13, 11 says this.
[time=1897] It says win it little by little.
[time=1898] Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow.
[time=1904] I was in the auction business, and so I dealt with entrepreneurial spirits who are very much about value and gaining more and marketability and things like that.
[time=1914] And so they'd wanna buy something and sell it for a profit.
[time=1917] That's just common.
[time=1918] That's what the marketplace in the economy is.
[time=1921] But it's interesting to me as I've studied this, that it's not designed.
[time=1926] I don't think God's designed a heart to buy something for a million dollars and sell it for 10 million dollars tomorrow.
[time=1931] It rarely happens.
[time=1933] It rarely happens in the economy of our world.
[time=1936] No, it's a design that would happen little by little, that it would be fair, that it would be equitable.
[time=1940] In fact, an initial public offering, an IPO when a corporation says we're gonna go public.
[time=1946] The public markets frown if the owners, the private owners of the company are taking it public and are making a huge profit at the expense of the shareholders.
[time=1954] They won't do that.
[time=1955] The underwriters won't allow that.
[time=1957] No, they'll make the executives and the private owners take the same risk that the shareholders will.
[time=1963] God has designed a generous heart is somebody who's not gonna take advantage of another person in an interaction with time-talender treasures.
[time=1972] Not gonna try to take advantage of it.
[time=1973] Goes on in Proverbs 30 verses eight, nine.
[time=1977] Says, keep falsehood and lies far from me.
[time=1980] Give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.
[time=1984] Let me trust in you.
[time=1985] Otherwise, I might hard my heart one to two ways.
[time=1989] I may have too much and just own you and say, who is the Lord?
[time=1993] Or I may become poor and steal and so dishonor the name of my God.
[time=1999] When you decide that you're gonna win, earn little by little, something unique happens, you have to trust God for the volume.
[time=2012] You have to trust God to bring enough buyers and sellers or whatever it is your way for that to happen.
[time=2018] The irony of it is, is that's why they come.
[time=2021] Because you have a heart that's generous.
[time=2025] You're generous as this resource comes in.
[time=2028] So will you today ask yourself, do I have a generous heart in the process of winning assets, of winning money even?
[time=2036] And if so, you know, just apply this practice of little by little and trust God for the volume.
[time=2044] And if not, maybe today's the day you flip that switch and you say, I'm gonna try something new.
[time=2050] I'm gonna risk with God in this.
[time=2052] Earning little by little, one way that God in his design brings resources in working.
[time=2058] Look with me at Proverbs 10, write that down.
[time=2060] Work, work is another way, a very important way in God's design for resources to make their way into your life and mine.
[time=2069] And God's word says some very important things, my friends, about working.
[time=2072] Proverbs 10, four and five.
[time=2075] We wanna see that hard work is important and we wanna see that smart work is important.
[time=2080] Let's look at it together.
[time=2081] Proverbs 10, verse four says, poor is he, poor is he, who works with a negligent hand.
[time=2091] You might wanna write in there next to negligent.
[time=2093] You might wanna write the word lazy.
[time=2095] Poor is he, who works with a lazy hand,
[time=2101] but the hand of the diligent, the hand of the hard worker, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
[time=2111] Hard work, smart work, look at verse five.
[time=2114] He who gathers in the summer.
[time=2116] Here we have some forward thinking.
[time=2119] Here we have some wisdom being evidenced.
[time=2121] He who gathers in the summer is a son who acts wisely, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who acts shamefully.
[time=2131] Let me just say this to you about hard work.
[time=2134] So many places that we could go with this, so many different topics that we could probably settle on.
[time=2139] I wanna just say this to every one of you.
[time=2141] I think one place where hard work, the understanding of it, the modeling of it, the benefits of it, there's one thing I wanna say to you this morning is that we would be so, I think God would be so honored and so many lives would be blessed if we would help them understand this at an early age.
[time=2162] We live in the most under disciplined, over entertained, over indulged society that our society and culture has ever seen.
[time=2173] Thousands and thousands and thousands of hours are spent in front of screens.
[time=2179] TV screens and computer screens and video game screens and so many times in the hurry and the rush of life, we end up just, and I said we, and I mean that.
[time=2190] This is something that I have to work on.
[time=2192] We end up giving, we end up just simply providing.
[time=2195] We end up for time's sake, I think taking shortcuts around the great benefit and value of teaching them at a very early age, their responsibility and the opportunity and the blessing that comes with hard work.
[time=2211] And I just, whether you've got little kids, whether you've got junior high-aged kids, whether you're a mom, dad, whether you're a grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncle, older brother, older sister, even.
[time=2224] See, these things can be passed along, and I would just encourage you that with a room full of blocks on the floor, with a dirty room that needs to be picked up,
[time=2235] with garbage that needs to be taken out.
[time=2238] I mean, with whatever the opportunity might be, there's a way that you, believe me, I grew up doing it the lazy way.
[time=2244] Many of you know my story.
[time=2246] I had to learn hard lessons later in life, but I wish I would have learned earlier in life.
[time=2251] There is a way to do the garbage.
[time=2253] There is a way to pick up the blocks.
[time=2255] There's a way to clean up the room that's just lazy.
[time=2259] It's not thorough, it's not complete.
[time=2261] There's not a spirit of, I'm so thankful I get to do this to make a contribution to this home.
[time=2267] There's a way to do it lazy, negligent, as the scriptures say, and there's a way to do it diligently.
[time=2273] And I want to just encourage you this morning to be thinking about those who are coming behind us and helping them do a diligent job.
[time=2282] In our house we've been talking about homework.
[time=2284] I hope this will make sense to most of you, I think.
[time=2287] There's a difference between homework and study.
[time=2290] Homework is what I have to do when, tonight.
[time=2293] Study is for something coming three days away.
[time=2297] There is a hard work, there is a discipline, there is a diligence required to actually stop and spend some time for something that's three days away versus just throwing in 30 minutes on an assignment due the next morning.
[time=2311] You could go to a number of different arenas of life and illustrate that very same thing.
[time=2316] Moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, aunts and uncles, older brothers and sisters help our younger ones learn what it means and looks like to work hard.
[time=2326] It's one of the ways that God brings resources.
[time=2329] - Anybody reading Proverbs a day that corresponds with the date of the month every day?
[time=2333] Well, you might have missed this 'cause it's, but you know, roughly 30 verses every time, but it's interesting that it says what Kelly just said, Proverbs 21-17, today I read this this morning.
[time=2343] He who loves pleasure will become a poor man.
[time=2347] He who loves wine and oil will not become rich.
[time=2352] Proverbs 10-5 talks about working smart.
[time=2354] It says he who gathers in summer is a son who acts wisely, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who acts shamefully.
[time=2361] My dad had me growing up learning this saying, we have a cultural saying that is really this verse.
[time=2366] It says make hay while the sun shines.
[time=2370] And that's really what this idea is.
[time=2372] It's what works smart.
[time=2373] It's what we do first in our lives.
[time=2377] I'm helping my senior daughter because she's getting ready to leave, you know, a senior in high school.
[time=2382] I'm helping her understand this word priorities and what you do first.
[time=2385] I said what words at the beginning of priorities?
[time=2387] She said prior, that's right.
[time=2389] We gotta talk about what you're gonna do prior to accomplishing other things.
[time=2393] What's gonna happen first?
[time=2396] There are a lot of athletes here in this room.
[time=2398] Whether you play basketball, volleyball, softball, you not just only have to work hard, but you have to work smart.
[time=2403] I tell kids, you know, it's one thing to bring intensity and bring all that effort.
[time=2407] We want you to, but we want you to work smart.
[time=2409] You can spend all that time doing things incorrectly and developing bad habits.
[time=2416] A lot of us do that in the workplace.
[time=2418] We might work really hard, but we develop bad habits.
[time=2420] We don't give attention to the things that we need to give attention to prior first.
[time=2425] So we're designed not just to work hard, but to work smart.
[time=2429] That's part of wisdom and a generous heart to do that.
[time=2434] So on how it comes in, the resources, we win it little by little, we work hard and we work smart and we wanna weigh relationships greater than remuneration as if it were on a scale.
[time=2446] We weigh relationships greater than remuneration.
[time=2451] I'll say it a different way.
[time=2452] People, we weigh people heavier or greater than profit.
[time=2457] Proverbs 11, 24 through 26 says this.
[time=2461] One man gives freely, yet gains even more.
[time=2466] Another withholds unduly but comes to poverty.
[time=2469] Kind of unleashes the, what, cement idea there.
[time=2472] A generous man will prosper.
[time=2475] He who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.
[time=2480] We weigh people more than profit.
[time=2482] We relationship more than remuneration.
[time=2484] And then it goes on to say this.
[time=2485] People curse the man who hoards grain, but blessing crowns him who is willing to sell.
[time=2491] Mitch, what does that have to do with weighing relationships greater than remuneration, weighing people greater than profit?
[time=2499] Well, I'm glad you asked him.
[time=2500] Have you ever thought about why somebody would be hoarding the grain?
[time=2504] Thought about why?
[time=2506] What would be the big deal?
[time=2508] Let me think about it.
[time=2510] It's because he was not willing to accept the market price.
[time=2515] He was gonna gouge somebody.
[time=2517] He was gonna put profit ahead of people.
[time=2520] He was gonna put remuneration above relationship.
[time=2524] A lot of you know Chuck Kelly.
[time=2527] Chuck is a car dealer.
[time=2529] And Chuck had just gone out to a seminar for mega car dealers to learn how to increase sales, how to do a better job.
[time=2536] And Chuck found himself coming back with his sales force and his weekly meeting in front of him, thinking about how he's gonna summarize it.
[time=2544] And he told me that I just decided to summarize it in two sentences.
[time=2549] And here are the two sentences.
[time=2550] I think to sell more cars, you gotta do one or two things.
[time=2555] Either hear the two sentences, deepen the relationships that you already have, and go make new ones.
[time=2567] Go make new relationships, and/or deepen the ones you already have.
[time=2572] If you do that, cars sell themselves.
[time=2575] In whatever it is you're doing, whenever you lock eyes with a human being, if you'll put that relationship over the remuneration, the resource of life just becomes a byproduct.
[time=2587] I found this to be true in my own life, in auctioning, collector cars, airplanes, real estate, all kinds of things.
[time=2593] I realized how often my contact with the customer was about what he could do for me under the guise of what I could do for him.
[time=2601] And I came to this concept in my own life, and I thought, well, can I risk that with God?
[time=2608] Can I be generous with my time, talent, and treasures?
[time=2610] Could I just actually invest in a relationship?
[time=2614] And I don't mean play around and never ask for the order, as we would say.
[time=2618] But I mean, can I really get to know a guy, know his needs, know what's going on in his life, know a little bit about his family, and will that have anything to do with the remuneration?
[time=2630] Will that ever follow?
[time=2630] I don't know, but I decided I'd risk, and go ahead and find out.
[time=2633] I discovered that a world flocks to somebody who will weigh relationships greater than remuneration.
[time=2640] And so we would just invite you today to consider testing God in this, to consider giving it a try, that as it comes in that you went a little by little, that you would work hard and smart, and that you would weigh relationships greater than remuneration, and let money be a byproduct of the relationship.
[time=2656] - So that's the end. - That's the end.
[time=2659] - That's the end.
[time=2660] That's how God and his design, three ways in which God allows those resources to flow in.
[time=2664] Let's talk just for a moment this morning.
[time=2666] Let's look and see what the scriptures say about how in God's design, resources are allowed to move out.
[time=2673] And that's where I want you to see Proverbs 16-6.
[time=2676] Mitch, tell them a little bit about how God is our passion.
[time=2680] As relations move out, it's so important.
[time=2683] As resources move out, it's so important that God would be at the center of that activity, God being our passion, Proverbs 16-6.
[time=2693] - By loving kindness and truth, iniquity is in tone four.
[time=2697] By loving kindness, by loving truth, sin is a tone for a tone at one, being made one with God.
[time=2705] And by the fear of the Lord, one keeps away from evil.
[time=2709] What does that have to do with passion?
[time=2711] Well, it's this concept of the fear of the Lord, of love and truth and the fear of the Lord and being one intimately with the God of the universe.
[time=2719] So he can prompt you.
[time=2721] It will look different with different people on how the resources go out.
[time=2726] But this concept of the fear of the Lord that's 14 times, I think, in Proverbs is this reverence or this, this fatherly-like fear, not a slave-like fear, but a fatherly-like fear that I love and I revere the person of the Lord, the God of the universe.
[time=2742] And then he will keep me away from evil, a way that's apart from God's heart, a way that's apart from the generous heart of the creator of the universe, even in how resources go out.
[time=2754] So God is my passion, is part of that seven-fold centrality of the Lord that we pull out here for how it reflects God and how resources go out.
[time=2763] - All right, let's look at the first one.
[time=2765] On this journey of our resources out toward others, wave or give.
[time=2771] Our resources can be waived or given in three directions.
[time=2775] We want to show you those this morning, three different directions to God, to the poor and to our children.
[time=2782] Let's start with God.
[time=2784] And here I want you to see in Proverbs three, turn there.
[time=2787] Would you Proverbs three versus nine and 10?
[time=2789] This is how we can give.
[time=2791] This is how we offer our resources to God.
[time=2794] The Scriptures talk about a tithe and the Scriptures talk about an offering.
[time=2799] And I want to show you both of those here this morning.
[time=2802] Start with Proverbs three, nine.
[time=2804] It says, "Honor the Lord from your wealth." Honor the Lord from your wealth.
[time=2808] And again, nobody in the room.
[time=2811] Well, I don't think anybody in the room gets to beg out on this, because again, we've helped you in recent months around here realize the reality of this idea of wealth.
[time=2821] You are wealthy today.
[time=2823] We sometimes characterize or we sometimes define wealth wrongly.
[time=2827] Again, realize that in the reality of our world today, you are wealthy if you have change in the ashtray, in your car.
[time=2835] Raise your hand if you have change in your car.
[time=2838] Everybody, raise your hand.
[time=2840] Great, raise your hand if you had breakfast this morning.
[time=2843] Raise your hand if you'll have lunch following this.
[time=2846] Raise your hand if you'll have dinner.
[time=2848] See, you're wealthy, you are wealthy off the charts.
[time=2853] Over 24,000 will die today, because they had no food.
[time=2858] And they didn't have any food yesterday, and they didn't have any food for the 30 days prior to that.
[time=2865] We are absolutely over the top rich.
[time=2869] So everybody in the room gets to apply this.
[time=2874] Honor the Lord from your wealth.
[time=2877] And from the first of all your produce, the first real simple concept there, it's the picture of you and I sitting down, let's just say at the beginning of a month, and we chart out our month.
[time=2889] It's you and I sitting down with our produce, with what we make, with what we're able to bring in.
[time=2894] And it's thinking about and not just thinking about, but choosing to make the gift to God prior to making any other gift anywhere else.
[time=2903] It is a first fruits off the top thinking that says, you know what, no matter my condition, I want to exercise the faith needed.
[time=2912] With all the bills stacked up on the table, with all the responsibilities that I've got, I am going to honor God from my wealth, and from the very first of my produce, give to him.
[time=2925] So why?
[time=2925] So that verse 10, "So that your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine." What do you think about that?
[time=2935] I think giving to God, put yourself in a position where you have to trust him as the provider of the resources.
[time=2946] We have a tendency to trust in the gifts and not the giver.
[time=2950] And I want to show you what it says in Malachi, very last book in the Old Testament.
[time=2954] Turn there, would you?
[time=2955] Malachi, chapter three, I want to read to you verses eight, nine, and 10.
[time=2962] And I want you to see here this idea of the tithe and the offering.
[time=2967] Corbin will stand up here often.
[time=2968] I'll stand up here often and invite you to give of your tithes and your offerings.
[time=2974] And this is exactly why we say this.
[time=2976] It says in verse eight of Malachi three, "Will a man rob God?" Most of us would say, "Well, no, we don't want to rob God.
[time=2984] Yet you are." He says, "You are robbing me." But you say, "How?
[time=2989] How have we robbed you in tithes and offerings?" You are cursed with a curse for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you.
[time=2998] Bring the whole tithe, all of it.
[time=3003] Trust me, go ahead, bring it.
[time=3005] Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house.
[time=3011] And test me now in this, says the Lord of hosts.
[time=3014] If I will not, when you do that, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows, it's interesting, Mitch read a passage just a few moments ago that talked about the blessing that God wants to give.
[time=3030] In the Hebrew, the word for generous is one who possesses a soul of blessing.
[time=3037] And God wants nothing more than to bless you and I, but God says for that to happen, you and I have got to be people willing to bring the whole gift.
[time=3047] And there is the tithe and there is the offering.
[time=3050] And I'm gonna just have Mitch real quickly, just real quickly, he's gonna just describe the difference between the two for you.
[time=3056] - Well, the tithe means 10th, the tithe was 10% and it kind of took care of all the needs of this two and a half million people going from slavery and to freedom.
[time=3066] And the tithe was 10% and it would take care of the people, it would take care of, it would be kind of like the tax, it would take care of welfare, it would just, it took care of everything.
[time=3073] But then there was this idea of an offering that you would give out of a generous heart.
[time=3076] And when you think about it, it actually prevents this from becoming religion.
[time=3081] It keeps it as a relationship.
[time=3082] It goes back to a heart condition.
[time=3084] And so as you look at the Old Testament on what God, the generous one designed, you have not just the tithe, but you got this idea that they rested the land every seven years.
[time=3093] They canceled debts every seven years.
[time=3095] And then every seven sevens, every 50 years, they had another big cancellation.
[time=3100] They had three great feasts where there was a lot of giving.
[time=3103] They had the gleaming laws where you left a little bit on your crops so that the poor could come by and pick it up.
[time=3109] We see Jesus and his disciples doing it in the New Testament.
[time=3112] So an Old Testament scholar has studied this, done the math and he thinks that giving was actually between 20 and 30% a year of annual increase, 20 to 30% of an annual increase.
[time=3123] And this heart must have been multiplied so much, this is interesting.
[time=3127] In what many would call the first building project in the Bible, Exodus 25, too, there's this idea thrown out, this is give as prompted.
[time=3136] We're gonna develop a sanctuary, give as prompted.
[time=3139] So it takes it all back to your heart with the heart of the God of the universe.
[time=3143] There's a spirit's gonna prompt you.
[time=3144] And then you fast forward, you go to Exodus 36 verses three through seven, if you wanna read it tonight, Exodus 36 verses three through seven, and they come into Moses and Moses, we got everything we need, but now we got too much 'cause they're still giving.
[time=3158] And Moses said, "Well, I have to tell people to stop." It's interesting that this generous heart must have been multiplied, this what's met heart must have been multiplied in the people so much.
[time=3168] I had a friend, some write it to me this way.
[time=3170] He says, "It's whether or not, Mitch, I think, "whether you get to give to get, "or give to get to give." I'll say it again.
[time=3179] Do you get to give to get or give to get to give?
[time=3184] Do you get to give to get?
[time=3186] Do you get in order to give hoping that you'll get more?
[time=3190] And getting is your passion, or do you give to God and to others so that you can give again?
[time=3199] Which one is your passion?
[time=3201] Which one shows God is your passion?
[time=3204] And so I just wanna encourage you to day with that and maybe to think about that and wrestle with that and see what God's doing in your heart 'cause this all comes down to a matter of the heart.
[time=3213] - Somebody asked me this week again what my hopes were as far as an amount that we might raise or our future on this project.
[time=3223] And I told them again what I told you a few weeks ago, this is not about a number.
[time=3227] This is about a privilege and opportunity we get to be priests that go and to train up and equip a future generation of priests that will go beyond where you and I went.
[time=3238] And this is about, I believe, generosity.
[time=3241] And my hope for you and I in the days to come, we're gonna come back to this next week, pick it up right where we left off today.
[time=3247] And my hope is that you would be as you think about your gift, as you think about your life, as you think about your ministry inside and outside these four walls.
[time=3256] There is so much truth here, my friends.
[time=3258] We need to be a generous soul of blessing toward others.
[time=3264] And I hope you'll come back and learn more about that next week.
[time=3268] Would you stand?
[time=3269] Let me pray for us as we go.
[time=3272] Father God, we are grateful that you are a generous God.
[time=3276] You have a soul of blessing and you have wanted nothing more than to redeem a people who could be your own, a people who could represent you, Father.
[time=3284] And we want to be that.
[time=3286] God help us, guide us, direct us.
[time=3289] This truth that we've heard today.
[time=3291] Oh God, I pray that we would ponder it.
[time=3293] I pray that we would read it through again.
[time=3295] God, I pray that we would talk about it.
[time=3297] Oh God, I pray that your spirit and your word and your people would help me apply this in the everyday of my life, in the way I view the resources, God, that you've given me, my time and my talent and my treasure.
[time=3312] God, bring us back again next week, if that be your will.
[time=3315] Thank you for the privilege we have of knowing you and following you.
[time=3319] And we commit ourselves to your service and your son's name, we pray.
[time=3323] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3334] [MUSIC - 191 seconds]
