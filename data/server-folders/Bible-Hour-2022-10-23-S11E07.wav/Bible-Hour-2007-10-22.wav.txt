[time=346] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=351] As always, we're thankful for this time and so grateful that we get to spend time like this together each and every week.
[time=359] It's almost November and with November comes the realization that December and the Christmas celebration and the season surrounding our Lord's birth is just around the corner.
[time=370] And when I say Christmas and Black Hawk, I know that for many of you in the community, myself as well, our minds go back to what was a tradition for nearly 25 years here at Black Hawk and that is the living Christmas tree.
[time=385] I'm sure there are hundreds if not thousands of you out in the Fort Wayne community and greater northeast Indiana community where when I say living Christmas tree, you remember the first time you came to the tree.
[time=398] You remember what it was like to watch it for the first time and to see the lights and to hear the music and to take in that tree full of voices that were proclaiming the great truth of Christmas.
[time=409] Well, we are so thankful to announce to you that the living Christmas tree is back. That's right. Peter Colby, who is a former worship pastor here at Black Hawk, has gotten together with 18 different local churches.
[time=423] What an amazing thing. 18 different churches supporting this effort and the tree will be back at the Scottish Rite.
[time=430] I want to encourage you to go to the website right here on the screen.
[time=434] If you'll go to this website, you'll be able to find out where tickets are available. I'll tell you what, they're going quickly and I want to make sure that you have a chance to go and take in this momentous occasion.
[time=445] We at Black Hawk are so thankful for the privilege we get to be a part of this.
[time=450] Our own Black Hawk Christian school premiere dinner night is now being reconnected to the living Christmas tree.
[time=457] There are any of you interested in coming to our premiere dinner and auction. We'd love to give you some information and get you a table.
[time=465] You can call us at this number here at the school 493 7470 493 7470 and ask to speak with Steve Wild, our Development Director.
[time=475] Hey, we can't wait. Looking forward, so looking forward to this season and I hope you'll come and be a part of it with us. God bless you. Have a great week.
[time=487] [MUSIC - 356 seconds]
[time=872] [APPLAUSE]
[time=877] My name is Kim Ward and I started at Black Hawk Christian School when I was in Southmore and I graduated in 1986. We have four children who currently go to Black Hawk. We have Teddy, who's a senior, and she started at Black Hawk when she was in kindergarten and she'll be graduating this year. And then we have two twins, Patrick and Elizabeth, who are currently freshman and Rachel, who's in the eighth grade.
[time=897] [MUSIC]
[time=901] One of the people who had the biggest impact on me during my years at Black Hawk was Steve Longbrake, obviously. He was the principal when I was there and he also taught senior government and he tortured us through reading Francis Shafers, how should we then live. And I thought it was cumbersome at the time and I really didn't know what all he was trying to achieve with that. But thinking back over the years, I've noticed that he
[time=925] brought in little bits of his own life during that time and taught us lessons and really tried to teach us as we set forth on our own and we're going to graduate from high school to take what we had learned at Black Hawk and apply it to our decisions and our actions out in the world.
[time=942] [MUSIC]
[time=952] It is a big financial sacrifice for us to send the kids to Black Hawk, especially since there are four of them. But it was very important for us because, I mean, we graduated from Black Hawk and we know that the academics is at the highest level, but we think we could have gotten that at other places.
[time=961] There are other places in Fort Wayne where we could have gotten the same academic level that we get at Black Hawk, but we didn't feel that there was any place else that taught them the same values that we have and taught them how important it was, not just to learn academics and learn the biblical principles that they're learning but to apply them in their life.
[time=983] And we feel that their peers that they are surrounded with have a big impact on their life and we're blessed that they could go to Black Hawk and be surrounded by the group of kids that they are, as well as the teachers who just pour themselves into the lives of the kids.
[time=1000] And we have always felt that since we've been here and we think it's worth it and we consider it a real gift that they can come here.
[time=1006] My experience at Black Hawk taught me that I should strive to do the best at everything that I do and that I should always try to achieve excellence in what I do, but that I should not do that for my own glory, but I should do that for the glory of God.
[time=1026] And I should just be a witness for him as I'm out there in the marketplace and I try to do that all the time.
[time=1035] What encourages me the most is the activities that the children or that the youth groups are doing.
[time=1041] I see all my kids are plugged in at either Alliance or 212 and they enjoy doing that, it's not something that I make them do, they want to go, they want to go to camp and they want to hang out at higher grounds after church.
[time=1054] And I had recently heard a statistic that 70% of kids who go off to be freshman in college fall away from the church and I think it's so important that it become their experience and their time at church instead of mom and dad forcing them to do that.
[time=1070] And I really feel like they're getting that connection here at Black Hawk.
[time=1085] We're in the second part of a two part series entitled "God's Inns, Outes, Ups, and Downs of the Resources for Life" and the picture is a generous heart.
[time=1097] And a generous heart would be one that is open, want to take your hand like that.
[time=1102] Everybody, take your hand like that.
[time=1105] A proud heart would be a greedy heart and it's one of those clothes, it's funny that a hard heart and a tight fist go together and do it around me, so it's like that.
[time=1113] You can put your hands down, that's the imagery of what we're talking about.
[time=1116] All of what we have last week and this week comes from Proverbs.
[time=1121] Proverbs is a wisdom book.
[time=1123] Wisdom is the intersection of the vertical with the horizontal.
[time=1126] It's living in the sweet spot of where the vertical intersects with the horizontal.
[time=1130] The vertical is my relationship with God.
[time=1133] The horizontal would be my relationships and tasks with other people.
[time=1136] So it's God's righteousness or God's heart vertically being made sticky to my circumstances, to the people and the relationships, the tasks around me.
[time=1147] How to make sense in my relationship with God with my circumstances is what we all really need.
[time=1152] Proverbs means generally true most of the time.
[time=1154] Generally true most of the time we're either going to be on the Y side of the equation or the foolish side of the equation.
[time=1162] And it's so interesting on how the Bible says, Proverbs specifically says this is all a matter of the heart.
[time=1169] Just like there are four chambers of the human heart, physical heart.
[time=1174] There are four chambers of the spiritual heart I think by a biblical definition.
[time=1177] That would be my mind or my thoughts, my will or my choices.
[time=1184] A third my emotions should be my feelings and then fourth my spirit or my prayers or frankly at times lack of them.
[time=1196] It's all kind of summed up in Proverbs 3.34 which the New Testament writers reflect on and quote.
[time=1202] And that is that God takes absolute resistance to a heart that is proud and greedy, one that is cured concrete.
[time=1210] And it's actually His grace that He does that to bring us back to be a heart of what cement.
[time=1215] But God gives grace to the humble.
[time=1220] God's generosity flows through a humble heart.
[time=1225] And so what we saw last week were the ins and outs.
[time=1230] And we're going to finish the outs today, the ins.
[time=1232] And we see here with the in, the out, the up, the down with how money goes in or time comes in or talent comes in.
[time=1239] How it goes out, what happens when it builds up and we'll have the game and what happens when it goes down.
[time=1245] We see that there's this theme in Proverbs that we pull from what theologians would call the sevenfold centrality of the Lord in Proverbs 16.
[time=1254] The first seven verses in Proverbs 16.
[time=1256] And we saw that as it comes in, God is my provider.
[time=1259] And we're giving you ten W's, ten words to start with a letter W as tools, practices that Proverbs gives us.
[time=1268] So as in, it's God is my provider.
[time=1271] From cover to cover it talks about God being my provider.
[time=1274] So the first W, if you want to catch up, is when.
[time=1277] That's how you earn it.
[time=1278] And the Proverbs says little by little.
[time=1281] When little by little.
[time=1283] Second on how it comes in, you have to work.
[time=1286] There's this direct correlation to money coming in and work.
[time=1289] And I need to do two things.
[time=1290] I need to work hard and I need to work smart.
[time=1294] And third way, relationships greater than remuneration.
[time=1299] Relationships heavier than remuneration.
[time=1303] People more important than profit.
[time=1306] And then we see how it goes out.
[time=1308] How it goes out is that God is my passion.
[time=1311] That as resources, as the three resources of life, time, talent and treasures, flow out of my life.
[time=1319] That they should reflect God is my passion.
[time=1322] And the first W out was wave.
[time=1326] And that means to give, W-A-I-V-E, to wave, to give.
[time=1329] And Proverbs talks about giving in three directions.
[time=1332] Give to God, give to the poor, and give to your children.
[time=1337] And I think last time here, we got through give to God.
[time=1341] And I think we're ready for give to the poor.
[time=1344] Give to the poor.
[time=1345] That's right.
[time=1346] Would you look at Proverbs 19, giving to the poor.
[time=1349] For God's design, we believe the Scriptures teach it and communicate it clearly.
[time=1353] Part of God's design for us reflecting the passion or the heart of God as resources make
[time=1360] their way out of our lives is giving to the poor.
[time=1363] Proverbs 19, would you look at Proverbs 19 verse 17.
[time=1367] One who is, you can see it right there.
[time=1369] One who is gracious to a poor man lends to the Lord.
[time=1374] And he will repay him, the Lord will, and he will repay him the one who was gracious for his good deed.
[time=1383] Proverbs 19, 17.
[time=1385] Look over at, if you will, look at Proverbs 21, 13.
[time=1389] Proverbs 21, 13.
[time=1391] He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor.
[time=1394] He who shuts his ear, he who ignores, he who turns his back on.
[time=1401] Many of you, including me in the room this morning, have done this.
[time=1406] And I want to ask you why in just a moment, but finish up verse 13.
[time=1412] He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor will also cry himself and not be answered.
[time=1420] And not be answered.
[time=1422] Why do we do that?
[time=1423] Why would it be?
[time=1425] And I won't speak for all of you.
[time=1427] There might be many of you in the room who have come a long way down this road.
[time=1430] And maybe that's not the response of your heart.
[time=1432] Maybe that's not your first inclination.
[time=1435] Why is it my first inclination still at times?
[time=1440] I'm thankful God's been, God's been, I think, growing my heart in this in recent years.
[time=1445] But why do I want to walk the other way?
[time=1449] Why when I'm in Chicago?
[time=1451] Why when I'm in New York?
[time=1452] Why when I'm in Fort Wayne?
[time=1455] And I come across a needy, desperate person.
[time=1460] Why do I want to walk the other way?
[time=1465] And I would invite you just to think that through.
[time=1467] I would invite you to answer that question.
[time=1470] For those of you who it applies to in the room, what is it that goes on in your heart?
[time=1476] And I would just take you back to what Mitchell just did.
[time=1478] A great, great job of introducing, as he introduced this whole idea to you again this morning.
[time=1484] God is opposed to a heart that is proud, and God is for.
[time=1490] God is thankful for the heart that is humble.
[time=1495] And I think it is your pride, and I think it is mine, that leads us to turn and walk away.
[time=1502] Because you know what?
[time=1503] We work for our money, and why don't they get a job?
[time=1508] You know what I deserve, I deserve, we say or we think, to keep every penny of my money,
[time=1514] because it's mine.
[time=1516] And I don't appreciate them because they're lazy.
[time=1519] They're lazy.
[time=1520] Of course they're lazy, or they wouldn't be on this street corner.
[time=1525] And I would just encourage you this morning to be very careful, to give thought to the heart of God.
[time=1531] And I just gave you two verses there.
[time=1533] There are others that would encourage you to be so very, very humble.
[time=1537] And so very willing.
[time=1539] Be wise, yes.
[time=1541] Continue to be wise, and to continue to exercise, discernment.
[time=1544] But to be very careful how you and I view the opportunities he gives us blatantly, maybe subtly,
[time=1553] to help meet the need of one that Jesus calls in Matthew 25, the least of these.
[time=1560] And yeah, you know what?
[time=1561] You and I can go down the road on why they're hungry, or why they're cold, or why they don't have any clothes, or why they're thirsty, or why they're unemployed.
[time=1569] There's probably a lot we could talk about and think about there.
[time=1572] But oftentimes that talking and thinking is just an excuse for me.
[time=1579] To not share, to not give, to not be gracious, to not be humble.
[time=1585] And that's what this comes back to again, and again, and again.
[time=1589] Be humble.
[time=1590] Be open and willing.
[time=1591] Give to God.
[time=1592] Give to the poor.
[time=1593] Give to your children.
[time=1595] Proverbs 13.22.
[time=1597] Give to your children.
[time=1598] Proverbs 13.22.
[time=1599] This is just a direction that Proverbs talks about waving the resources on.
[time=1605] Time and talent included.
[time=1608] I want you to realize that.
[time=1609] A good man leaves an inheritance for his children's children, but a sinner's wealth is stored up for the righteous.
[time=1616] I just want to give a big caveat right here.
[time=1619] I'm probably based on my circumstances and what I've seen in the marketplace and relationships that I've had with wealthy people.
[time=1627] I am opposed to just handing large amounts of money to young people who have never worked for it.
[time=1637] The reason is, it ruins them.
[time=1640] I have rarely ever seen a situation where it has helped them.
[time=1644] In fact, do you know that I think it's two-thirds, it might even be three-fourths of all lottery winners?
[time=1652] And I've had lottery winners come to my auctions and want to spend their winnings.
[time=1656] Two-thirds to three-fourths of all lottery winners go bankrupt within five years.
[time=1662] That's the problem I got with it.
[time=1664] But what I think Proverbs is saying is that there's three resources in life and it's time, talent and treasures.
[time=1672] And the only way this gets passed on is through wisdom to teach your children the reality how to live in the sweet spot
[time=1682] where the vertical intersects with the horizontal.
[time=1685] So they do everything that we've talked about and how it comes in so they would win little by little work hard and work smart
[time=1691] so that they would weigh the relationships greater than remuneration so that it would wave it in three directions to God, to the poor, and to their children through wisdom.
[time=1700] That that would be the pathway, that would be the vehicle on how that's done because wisdom, as we'll see, is more desirable than any wealth.
[time=1709] So I would just encourage you to think through how you got that going on because it was Socrates, I think, said if I could say any one thing to everyone,
[time=1720] I would stand up in the highest hill in Athens and I would look out and I would say to everybody, why? Why do you scratch and crawl and lift every stone looking for money
[time=1732] and spend so little time with your children to whom you're going to give it all anyway?
[time=1737] So what I beg you to take away from this is an investment of wisdom into your children.
[time=1744] Next, the second W under God is my passion is to the W ward off debt.
[time=1751] And in parentheses, I have the word surety.
[time=1756] Okay, borrowing money, a mortgage, a loan for your car, a church borrowing on a construction loan,
[time=1762] knowing they have pledges that are coming to pay for it.
[time=1765] That's one kind of debt and a yellow light, if we're coming up to the street corner and there's an intersection, a yellow light ought to be going off.
[time=1773] Sum it up the way my dad says it.
[time=1775] I found out it's kind of funny.
[time=1777] You know him that even says this, but he said I found out it's a lot easier to borrow it than it is to pay it back.
[time=1784] And that's the problem.
[time=1786] When you borrow money, one person shared with me in between services, you're actually presuming on God's time, talent and treasures.
[time=1795] It's a dangerous place to be.
[time=1797] You're presuming that in the future it's going to come my way and this all get taken care of.
[time=1802] Okay, so a yellow light ought to go up when you come to borrowing money in any way, shape or fashion.
[time=1806] I think the drama said the borrower is the slave to the lender.
[time=1810] Okay.
[time=1811] However, there is one kind of concept of debt that I think the Bible puts a red light on,
[time=1818] closes a door, says don't ever do it.
[time=1823] And that is surety.
[time=1824] That is owing more than the asset is worth.
[time=1830] And I think that it says that fairly clearly in Proverbs 22 verses 26 and 27.
[time=1839] Proverbs 22 verses 26 and 27.
[time=1845] Do not be a man who strikes hands in a pledge or puts up security for debts.
[time=1850] Why?
[time=1851] If you lack the means to pay, if you don't have the resources equal to or greater than the liability,
[time=1858] your very bed will be snatched from under you.
[time=1863] I think one translation actually uses the word surety quite frequently in those verses in Proverbs.
[time=1873] When I own Cruz International, I owned the auction company.
[time=1879] I was struggling because I think at least at one point in my life I was living in surety.
[time=1886] I think, I would know for sure, but I think that the liabilities were greater than the assets.
[time=1892] And I didn't know where the next day's resources was going to come from.
[time=1896] And then you remember my uncle the attorney who brought me down this pathway of measuring success by wisdom instead of by money, by the world's way.
[time=1904] And I started to read and study and apply these things to my life at that point.
[time=1909] It kind of has God has done it in my life and I'm sure he's done it in yours.
[time=1913] I get a call one day from a guy who had restored a 55 or 56 fourth Thunderbird convertible and he had, it was in the early stages of glaucoma and he couldn't drive and enjoy it anymore.
[time=1926] Well that man was Larry Burkett, the founder or co-founder of Money Matters who was on the radio business by the book, How to Do Business, you know, through God's principles from the Bible.
[time=1939] And so it was really kind of a cool thing because Truett Cathy, the owner of Chick-fil-A ended up buying it at the auction in Atlanta.
[time=1945] But I had Larry as a captive audience on the phone, we got all done, I told him how he'd sell the card and all that and everything was great.
[time=1950] And I said Larry can I ask you a question.
[time=1952] He was very like I won't be on the radio.
[time=1954] And he says sure.
[time=1955] And I told him about a scenario I was in.
[time=1958] There was a Christian banker who was soliciting me and he was saying Mitch I'll give you the money.
[time=1963] I'll tie up your whole life in parentheses but he didn't say it that way.
[time=1968] And I'll give you the money.
[time=1970] You can make every improvement at Cruise Auction Park that you want to make now and reap the benefit of that income stream that you would have with those improvements now.
[time=1976] I'll give you the line of credit so you can buy anything that you want where somebody doesn't want to have an auction and you resell in the auction method.
[time=1982] I'll do that for you.
[time=1983] So I'm telling Larry Burkett this.
[time=1985] I said but Larry I don't know unless my frequency was off.
[time=1990] I think God told me to be debt free and I'm heading down that path and paying everybody off and I'm going to be debt free.
[time=1997] Well Larry said Mitch borrowing money is not a sin.
[time=2002] I said do you say that on the radio Larry?
[time=2005] Well once in a while he said but let me tell you something.
[time=2008] If I ever thought God told me to be debt free I would never borrow a dime.
[time=2014] I would never borrow a dime because I would be robbing myself of the blessing that God has intended for me.
[time=2020] And it was just a few weeks later I lost face with that banker a little bit.
[time=2024] I was friends today but I could tell that he thought I was foolish in the way I'd approach things with him.
[time=2030] And it was a few weeks later and I had a meeting with a major international corporation and they became our first title sponsor for our events.
[time=2040] Which means they paid money to have their logo and have a presence in all of our marketing and in all of our events.
[time=2048] It was kind of like this, it was kind of like God sort of went, this is to me this is what I think he was saying Mitch, there's other ways I can do this.
[time=2058] You can trust in the giver, not the gifts.
[time=2062] And so that's what I would encourage you with today.
[time=2064] I would just run, I would run from ever owing money.
[time=2068] It would be a red light on ever owing money more than what the assets are to repay.
[time=2074] And then I would always have a yellow light go up because like my dad says it's if you're going to borrow money for any reason because it's a lot easier to borrow than it is to pay it back.
[time=2084] Well said, in God's provision, just keeping track here with our outline, we give to God, we give to the poor, we give to your children, we ward off debt.
[time=2095] That's what Mitch just talked about and then see here, write this down, waste not, waste not.
[time=2103] You want your spending to always be less than your net income, Proverbs 27.
[time=2109] Look at Proverbs 27 verses 23 and 24.
[time=2113] It says in verse 23, no well, no well.
[time=2118] It doesn't say have an idea, it doesn't say kind of have a figure in mind, it doesn't say kind of be general.
[time=2126] It says no well, the condition of your flocks.
[time=2132] You got to think about this now in terms of this culture, how these people made money, how cash came in.
[time=2139] No well, the condition of your flocks and pay attention to your herds for riches are not forever, nor does a crown endure to all generations.
[time=2153] We won't belabor this, we want to just make this point quickly, I think the scriptures make the point powerfully just on their own.
[time=2161] If I asked everybody in this room, everybody who it applied to, if I asked everybody in this room, how much money do you make?
[time=2171] How much comes in every month?
[time=2176] You know, the amazing thing is, while we talk about that being such a confusing arena at times, most of you, most of you know exactly.
[time=2186] Most of you know exactly how much comes in.
[time=2192] Most of you in the room know the condition of your flock.
[time=2196] You know what your herd is bringing in.
[time=2200] Many of you in the room to like, to the penny.
[time=2204] And the point that he's making here, I know it's a basic point, I know there are some in the room and you are so far beyond this, and I'm thankful for you.
[time=2212] You know what the sad, challenging truth is that for others, this is a new concept.
[time=2220] Don't spend more than that number.
[time=2228] Don't do that.
[time=2232] Don't spend more than you make, God says.
[time=2237] And when you honor that principle, and when you abide by that truth, when you give yourself to that kind of discipline, he honors and he blesses and you experience a freedom in life and in living and in giving that you've never known.
[time=2255] And I know it's basic, but I want to just remind you that the God of all wisdom for now today, he has determined that that's your number.
[time=2264] It's not unfair.
[time=2266] You're not getting hosed.
[time=2269] It's not a bad thing.
[time=2271] It's your number.
[time=2272] And God has in his sovereignty ordained that that is your number for today.
[time=2278] And so he promises to give you and I the strength and courage needed to live within that number.
[time=2286] We heard just this week, Mitch and I were talking about it before.
[time=2289] I heard it on CNN.
[time=2291] I actually read it on the website.
[time=2293] Average credit card debt today, $13,600.
[time=2297] Average credit card debt per family, consumer debt, including mortgages at an all-time high of $7.3 trillion.
[time=2310] And we're very aware of the pressure.
[time=2313] We're very aware, very aware of the pressure, the voices that you hear, the commercials that come at you, the philosophy of the day.
[time=2321] What'd you have down here, Mitch?
[time=2323] The advertisements say buy me, rent me, or put me in your hair.
[time=2332] Yeah.
[time=2333] I won't say anything.
[time=2336] You want me to do?
[time=2338] Yeah, I just go easy.
[time=2339] You want me to do with hold-not?
[time=2340] What's that?
[time=2341] You want me to do with hold-not?
[time=2342] Yeah.
[time=2343] All right.
[time=2343] Yeah, you do with hold-not.
[time=2344] Okay.
[time=2345] Well, I'm going to read from Proverbs 3.27.
[time=2347] So if you can turn in your Bible there and read with me on Proverbs 3.27.
[time=2352] See, this makes you look much more distinguished.
[time=2357] How's it make me look?
[time=2358] Those look stupid.
[time=2361] You obviously did not go to the thought that I did.
[time=2367] You do.
[time=2368] You look like a clown.
[time=2369] I do?
[time=2370] Yeah.
[time=2371] Funny like a clown?
[time=2373] Oh.
[time=2376] Back to with hold-not.
[time=2378] Okay.
[time=2379] You couldn't wait to get those out.
[time=2380] I mean, I was getting all hot.
[time=2381] I wanted to get in there so much sooner.
[time=2384] All right.
[time=2385] Do not withhold good.
[time=2387] Where are you?
[time=2388] Proverbs 3.27.
[time=2389] I'm right next to you.
[time=2391] Proverbs 3.27 with hold-not.
[time=2394] Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it is in your power to act.
[time=2399] Wow.
[time=2400] Time, talent, treasure.
[time=2401] You can run it all through that concept of withhold-not.
[time=2405] I think the new living translation says when you owe somebody, pay it.
[time=2411] I got my business finance degree from Indiana University.
[time=2415] And I had a dad who kind of believed that everybody was like him.
[time=2420] That nobody cared about money.
[time=2421] And so if he owed somebody, well, he'd rather owe you than beat you out of it.
[time=2424] It was no big deal to him.
[time=2425] It was probably no big deal to you.
[time=2427] Well, I found in life that wasn't true.
[time=2429] But I had two huge resources coming into my life saying don't pay people right when you
[time=2436] owe them.
[time=2437] You can earn money.
[time=2439] You can be a better manager of your resources.
[time=2441] If you just hold on to that a little while longer, maybe do other things with it, whatever it is.
[time=2446] And I got to tell you, if I had not been in a position where so many creditors and vendors
[time=2452] had put me on a cash-only basis, where I had to pay them up front for the work that they would do for me.
[time=2457] I was working off what I had owed them.
[time=2460] I probably wouldn't have been able to experience this.
[time=2463] But I think I have a unique perspective because I've experienced both sides of this.
[time=2467] I have withheld.
[time=2469] I have not paid when I had it in my power to do it.
[time=2473] And then I have.
[time=2474] And it's two totally different worlds because what happened is as I had to pay cash with
[time=2480] all these vendors, as I would go, guess what practice I adopted from that point on after
[time=2486] I paid them the old because I think God honored them.
[time=2489] I kept doing it.
[time=2492] I have a street smart guy, he says, "Quick payment means lasting friendship."
[time=2498] And I think that's what it is.
[time=2500] So I try to, oh, no man, nothing but love.
[time=2503] I really try.
[time=2504] And that's what I tried in the business and it transformed my business.
[time=2507] And I thought vendors kind of flocked to that.
[time=2510] And so I would just ask you kind of this idea that John Wesley put out there.
[time=2516] He said, "You know, the last portion of a person to get converted is his wallet."
[time=2523] So I would just ask you, you know, it's hard, but these go together, time talent treasures
[time=2529] all go into the heart.
[time=2530] You know, is your wallet converted?
[time=2533] Do you pay what you owe when you owe it?
[time=2535] I would encourage you to do so.
[time=2536] It really advances the kingdom of God because if you profess to be a Christian and you go off and do just one of these foolish practices, it does more damage to the kingdom of God I think than somebody who says, "Man, I don't know who God is." And I think Paul even says that clearly in the New Testament.
[time=2550] So I would just encourage you to ask, you know, in every financial transaction, is it valuable or is it vulnerable?
[time=2558] Valuable things tend to be eternal.
[time=2561] Valuable things tend to be only temporal at the expense of the eternal.
[time=2567] You know, all of this is a holistic approach.
[time=2571] It's not the dresser approach where I open a drawer and I say, "Okay, God's in the top drawer.
[time=2576] I opened the next door.
[time=2577] My family's in that drawer.
[time=2578] I opened the next one.
[time=2580] My church is there.
[time=2581] I opened the next door.
[time=2582] That's my career.
[time=2583] That's the way a lot of us have been told.
[time=2584] But I heard a really wise person say one time that God's idea and as I've studied Scripture myself, this is what I believe that God's idea is that He would permeate the entire dresser.
[time=2594] Those hierarchical things are when they conflict.
[time=2596] Like I never would want to put my work ahead of God when it conflicts with who God is.
[time=2600] But the whole idea is that God would permeate the whole.
[time=2605] So here's a video clip for you to take a look at that kind of shows you this concept.
[time=2618] [MUSIC]
[time=2648] Oh, I couldn't.
[time=2651] Well, maybe just a bite.
[time=2655] [MUSIC]
[time=2665] Don't forget the interest.
[time=2687] [MUSIC]
[time=2717] Dude, he brought the pie.
[time=2746] [MUSIC]
[time=2756] Yeah, the problems.
[time=2779] Last week, I think it was if you were here, I mean just a reminder to you on the whole pie thing.
[time=2786] Proverbs 3-9, honor the Lord from your wealth and from the what?
[time=2793] From the first of all your pieces, it says, yeah, it says produce there in Proverbs 3-9,
[time=2801] but same concept, powerful picture.
[time=2804] Keep going.
[time=2805] There's this idea that first fruits is actually the source so that I really think that quote at the end was the whole idea, dude, he brought the whole pie.
[time=2813] Is that what he said?
[time=2815] He brought the pie.
[time=2817] I would want you to remember as you leave this week, dude, he brought the pie because
[time=2823] it's how you handle your cars, your house, your education, all of that.
[time=2830] It's dude.
[time=2832] He brought?
[time=2834] He brought the pie.
[time=2836] I probably would have written that a little differently.
[time=2837] So on how it goes up, God is my purpose when I get a little ahead of the game.
[time=2842] This is when resources are good.
[time=2844] When resources are good and I got a little extra, time, talent, treasures, the needs to reflect that God is my purpose.
[time=2850] There's a purpose for why I've gotten ahead of the game.
[time=2854] 16-4, Proverbs says the Lord works out everything for his own ends, even the wicked for a day of disaster.
[time=2861] The Lord works out everything for his own purpose.
[time=2866] So even this can be for his purpose.
[time=2870] In the first A, I want you to remember, is worthy, worthy.
[time=2875] Worthy is this picture of my walk, matching my talk.
[time=2877] Again, it's so important.
[time=2878] I'm going to give you three words under worthy.
[time=2881] I'll go through them quickly, and it's steward, save, and be shrewd/harmless.
[time=2888] Steward, save, be shrewd, and harmless.
[time=2892] Steward, God owns it all.
[time=2894] Proverbs 19-21, Proverbs 19-21 says many are the plans in a man's heart.
[time=2900] But it is a Lord's purpose that prevails.
[time=2902] When I'm ahead of the game, and it's built up, I need to realize that I might have some plans.
[time=2907] I might get some plans for that when I'm a little ahead of the game.
[time=2910] No problem.
[time=2911] I would just encourage you to discern if it's a Holy Spirit prompting, and make sure that it's God's plan to God's purpose too.
[time=2917] You can learn that through prayer and wise counsel.
[time=2919] David, who wrote Psalm 24, which I think Corbin referenced this morning, also said this after
[time=2925] the temple money came in in 1 Chronicles 29-11, another building program in the Bible.
[time=2931] In 1 Chronicles 29-11, he said, "Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor.
[time=2937] For everything in heaven and earth is yours.
[time=2940] Yours, O Lord, is the kingdom.
[time=2942] You are exalted as head over all.
[time=2944] Yes, God created ownership.
[time=2946] Absolutely, there's no question.
[time=2948] But few people I have seen take it with them to the other side.
[time=2952] So it is going to pass on.
[time=2955] The second idea here in being worthy on my walk, match on my talk is I should save Proverbs 21-20.
[time=2961] I can't accurately predict the future.
[time=2963] In the house of the wise are stores of choice, food and oil, but a foolish man devours all
[time=2970] he has." At a very wealthy man, tell me one time when I was really young, work hard and save a lot.
[time=2977] Work hard and save a lot.
[time=2978] You never know when that rainy day is coming.
[time=2982] So quickly, Ron blew a financial planner as this big firm is a Christian and one of his guys are meeting with a pastor who was 75 years old and he walks in and says, "I want some help with my financial planning and my retirement." And they said, "Well, tell us a little bit about yourself." He said, "Well, I've never made more than $15,000 a year.
[time=3001] I've given at least 15 percent away.
[time=3004] And so now they're getting ready of his annual income away and now they're getting ready to say, "Oh my goodness, I'm going to help this guy with this $4,000 he has left." They said, "Well, sir, how much have you saved?" And he goes, "Five hundred and seven fifty." I go, "Oh, five hundred and seven… yeah, I got five hundred thousand dollars in the cash in the bank and seven hundred fifty thousand dollars in stocks and bonds." They said, "Sir, we're here to learn from you." And it's just interesting.
[time=3032] If you took twenty five hundred dollars a year and put it away for forty years and never touch it and it accumulated somewhere between eight and ten percent annualized compounded rate at the end of the forty years, you're a millionaire.
[time=3044] And it's just amazing how saving a little can transform your whole life.
[time=3049] And there it is.
[time=3050] It's from the Bible.
[time=3051] Third one is would be shrewd and harmless.
[time=3053] God doesn't want you to be gullible.
[time=3054] You should be shrewd.
[time=3055] You should be able to discern.
[time=3057] You should have street smarts, but you should be harmless to another individual with those.
[time=3062] Proverbs 10-2.
[time=3064] People got in treasures that would be harmful, gotten treasures are of no value, but righteousness
[time=3072] shrewd and harmless delivers from death.
[time=3074] And then I read this this morning, Proverbs 28 on the 28th of the month, Proverbs 28-6
[time=3080] says, "Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverse,
[time=3087] worthy, walk, match the talk, steward, save, be shrewd and harmless." And the resources for whatever reason are going up.
[time=3094] And again, don't forget here.
[time=3095] I'm not just talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[time=3097] I'm not talking about all of a sudden you're rolling in cash.
[time=3100] I'm just talking about all of a sudden there's extra.
[time=3104] All of a sudden for whatever reason, you have more than normal than remember worthy, steward that be shrewd, be don't worship it, worship not, don't, don't for a moment fall into
[time=3121] the trap that every one of you I would guess in this room has felt or come close to or even fallen into at times.
[time=3128] There are times when it seems so inviting the extra.
[time=3132] There are times when it seems so compelling the money that we would begin to actually
[time=3140] exercise and commit idolatry, actually worshiping it, actually fully surrendering our hearts
[time=3151] and lives to it and the pursuit of more of it and the enjoyment of all that it supposedly
[time=3157] can bring.
[time=3158] Let me just remind you of what it says here in Proverbs.
[time=3161] Look at Proverbs 11.4 if you would.
[time=3165] Look at Proverbs 11.4 says riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers
[time=3176] from death.
[time=3177] Now we just wrote this down remember you whether some things in life we don't know, there's some things in this world that we're not certain of.
[time=3184] Okay, there's some questions that you and I have about the future that we have a hard time answering.
[time=3189] Here's something that's very, very clear you will and I will stand before God.
[time=3197] Every one of us in this room will stand before God and give an answer and your net worth won't matter, not one bit.
[time=3208] What you owned or where you went or where you invested or how much it returned, your net
[time=3214] worth, your portfolio, your address, what you none of it will in the end matter one
[time=3221] single bit.
[time=3223] What will matter, Proverbs 11 says is your righteousness and you and I understand that
[time=3231] our righteousness is something that's not of us but something that we've received in relationship with who, with Christ.
[time=3241] I love what it says in Proverbs, look at 18, look at Proverbs 1811, Mitch and I were
[time=3248] looking at this this morning, it says in Proverbs 1811, it says a rich man's wealth is his strong
[time=3255] city.
[time=3256] Have you seen this before?
[time=3258] A rich man's wealth is his strong city and like a high wall in his own what?
[time=3264] In his own mind, you see when you get a little extra all of a sudden you think you've got the city, you think you've got the fortified position, you think all of a sudden with the wealth comes the security and the safety and the power and the ability that one has to
[time=3280] rest easy in this walled, gated, huge, fortified city.
[time=3288] And then Mitch and I saw read verse 10, look at verse 10, here's the truth about that.
[time=3294] The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous run to it and are safe.
[time=3303] The righteous run to it and are safe.
[time=3305] Jesus sums it up this way, right before he tells the parable of the rich fool, he says
[time=3311] this, it's Luke 1215, watch out, be on your guard against all kinds of greed, a man's
[time=3318] life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.
[time=3330] It comes from the God who the Bible tells us is our life and Christ is our life.
[time=3335] Fourth is the down, when it goes down, when I don't know where the next day is going to
[time=3342] be funded, we need to realize that God is my protector.
[time=3347] God is my protector, Proverbs 16-7, when a man's ways are pleasing to the Lord, when they're what's cement, when his hearts what's cement, he makes even his enemies live at peace with him.
[time=3357] He is a protector, just like Proverbs 18-10 said, he is a strong tower.
[time=3363] We can run to him and be safe.
[time=3365] So here's your tenth W, worry not.
[time=3368] Jesus was really clear on this too, worry not.
[time=3371] Do not experience a divided mind, do not be anxious for when your money or your time
[time=3377] or your time seems short.
[time=3378] Proverbs 23 verses 4 and 5, Proverbs 23 verses 4 and 5 say, do not weigh yourself out to
[time=3384] get rich, have the wisdom to show restraint, cast but a glance at riches and they are gone
[time=3391] for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle.
[time=3395] They are just merely ticks in an electronic automated system and you and I are going to
[time=3401] go to the other side.
[time=3404] Financial security never comes.
[time=3407] Rambu again has a couple of clients who are billionaires and he said not one of them would
[time=3413] refer to themselves as financially secure.
[time=3417] I heard Ted Turner say myself after he had given a billion dollars to the United Nations, everybody said, well that's no big deal, he's got a billion or two left.
[time=3425] Ted Turner actually said, I wake up every morning afraid that I'm going to lose it all.
[time=3430] Financial security will never come.
[time=3432] We need to trust in the giver, not the gifts.
[time=3437] I would just encourage you to kind of go through these and examine your heart and ask the spirit
[time=3444] of God, you know, is it what cement and how it goes in, do I reflect this wisdom and how it goes out, do I reflect God as my passion, do I see as it comes in that God is my provider, as it goes up, do I see that God is my purpose for this and that purpose is going to be revealed to me and when it goes down, do I realize that God is my protector.
[time=3463] A hard heart, one of cured concrete is greedy.
[time=3467] A generous heart is soft and humble and it's what cement.
[time=3473] It's an open hand that allows God to put it in and makes it easy for us to send it out.
[time=3478] All three resources of life, time, talent and treasures.
[time=3488] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
