[time=60] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I want to say welcome to you again.
[time=65] We're so thankful that you've joined us here for the broadcast, and I want to tell you today that I am so looking forward to the weekend of December 14th, 15th and 16th, and the opportunity we will have here at Blackhawk to invite all of you to come and join us for what will be an amazing celebration of Christmas.
[time=84] You know, for over 30 years now, the Blackhawk Church community has been able to,
[time=91] through the arts, have the unbelievable privilege of proclaiming this greatest story ever told.
[time=98] We call it CWB, Christmas with Blackhawk, and I've got some amazing memories of all the years I've been here, 12 total, but I'll tell you what, last year's performance was spectacular.
[time=110] It was not only spectacular, it was so very moving and significant.
[time=114] What Corbin and the team did was just amazing, and they're actually going to kind of bring back this year much of what took place last year.
[time=122] There are some added twists, and there are some additional numbers and artistic endeavors that they're going to bring to the mix, but the core of what took place last year and the theme, in a sense, is going to be back,
[time=136] and I want to just have you watch this, if you will, some amazing, amazing moments from last year's CWB.
[time=160] [MUSIC - 96 seconds]
[time=263] Well, like I said, amazing moments and great truth being proclaimed and what a great, great time we're going to have together.
[time=270] Hey, do me a favor, would you just make plans to come and be with us?
[time=274] And not just you, but would you give some thought to those that you work with, maybe those in your family, maybe those in your neighborhood?
[time=281] It is going to be an unbelievable three days, and we would love for you to come and be a part of CWB.
[time=287] If you've got interest in some tickets, we'd love to make those available to you.
[time=291] You can go to our website at blackhawkministries.org, click on the Christmas with Blackhawk icon, and everything you need will be right there.
[time=300] We would really love to have you with us, and it would be great if you come, maybe just hang around afterwards and give us the chance to meet.
[time=307] I'd love to find out who you are.
[time=309] I'd love to hear about how Blackhawk has encouraged you in recent months or years.
[time=314] We're so grateful for you, so thankful for the partnership we have with you, and we would love to celebrate Christmas together.
[time=321] Come and join us, CWB, 07.
[time=323] It's going to be an amazing, amazing time, and we'll look forward to seeing you there.
[time=328] [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
[time=373] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=424] Praise the Lord.
[time=437] My name is Paul McIntosh. I started at Blackhawk in first grade, and I stayed all through until graduation in 1987.
[time=452] When anyone who's gone to Blackhawk Christian School knows you cannot just pick one person. There's a team effort involved.
[time=459] And so when I think back, there's a large team, and I'm going to leave people out, I think of Happy Waltz, and I eat a Tahfalo,
[time=466] two wonderful teachers who started Blackhawk Christian School, and two that I remember giving me lots of hugs.
[time=475] Even on days when I didn't deserve lots of hugs, then I think of the pippens, and I think of Bob Freeborn and Joe Rich.
[time=487] I think of Sue Griggs. Steve Longbrake was very important. He was not lying with the principal. He was my basketball coach.
[time=495] He was my health teacher. He was my government teacher. And how many people can say that they wanted their high school principal to officiate their wedding?
[time=503] Not very many. So it's definitely been a team.
[time=508] God wants us to do our best. We don't have to be the best. He just wants us to do the best and do it every time.
[time=523] Seven to eight months ago, Pastor Bird did a series on "I Am a Priest." And I'm happy to see Blackhawk Ministries really view Blackhawk Christian School,
[time=536] and it's 750 students as little priests. And I'm encouraged when I have my kids go into the nursery, and I look inside and I see my students in there,
[time=549] leading my children in nursery, and seeing them being willing to be a servant and give up their time.
[time=558] And not very many high schoolers have a lot of free time. But they're still willing to help others. And that's exactly what the Lord wants.
[time=580] Well, thank you for Paul for Paul and his willingness to make that video just an amazing thought to realize that he came here as a first grader, and now he teaches
[time=590] to talk about impressions for life and what a privilege we get with our church and our school and the broadcast,
[time=598] these incredible opportunities that God's given us to, like, what cement, shape, and mold with his help. And I'm so grateful for Paul.
[time=608] So thankful for the really countless numbers of people who have helped make these last several weeks, and really much more than several weeks.
[time=617] This has been this project and our genuine effort to try and bring this to you as a family. It has been something that has been going on for months and months
[time=625] and months, and there are just a long list of folks who have worked really hard. I'm really grateful for them and really thankful that we get to today,
[time=632] and then culminating with next week, kind of bring this to a conclusion, and I'm really looking forward to being able to share with you today some things that God's put on my heart.
[time=642] I want to ask you first, who showed up an hour early today? Who messed up on the time thing? Come on, let's just confess.
[time=650] Raise your hand if you've messed up on the time thing. I sent you an email. I hope you got it reminding you.
[time=656] And just so we're clear, and we keep the slate clean, I got here this morning at 6.15.
[time=664] I sent you the email reminding you, forgot to set my own, rushed out of there, so I think I was actually up at 4.20 this morning when it was all said and done,
[time=673] and I'm feeling like it's time for lunch and a nap right now.
[time=677] But it's good to be together, and I want to just, if I could, in just a few minutes, I want to just give you a little quick review.
[time=684] So many of you, at times, come and go, and it's rare that we're all here for six weeks in a row,
[time=690] and so I want to just, as we think about what cement this incredible project, and it's so much more than a project,
[time=699] this incredible opportunity that God has given us to think about and give thought to a contribution of time, talent, and treasure that you and I might make,
[time=710] that would allow us to be postured in such a way, to do ministry in such a way, in the days to come, that would allow us to equip and train up priests that go.
[time=721] I want to just take a moment real quick and review where we've been on this journey. Wet cement brings with it six components.
[time=728] It is an amazing six component, something we've thought about, prayed about, talked about as a leadership for really the last two years,
[time=736] and I want to just make sure that we're remembering this morning as we begin to move toward next Sunday.
[time=741] I want to make sure that we're remembering what this is, at least on paper, and as far as the opportunity that's out there.
[time=748] I want to make sure we're reminded of what this is about.
[time=751] What you see on the screen are the six components, and I'll just review them basically for you, eliminate all long-term debt to 0.2 million dollars.
[time=759] Our hope is to raise enough funds so that we could eliminate all of our long-term debt freeing up $17,000 a month,
[time=766] over a quarter million dollars a year, to be freed up for us to do ministry in a more effective and meaningful way.
[time=773] Secondly, a BCS, Black Hawk Christian School, North Campus Elementary renovation, a complete renovation and remodel of our North Campus,
[time=782] a building that has served us very well for almost 40 years, needs a great deal of health.
[time=787] And so our hope is that we could, as church and school families, because we're all in this together,
[time=793] and we cannot wait to continue to be in it together, investing in and shaping and molding the hearts and lives of these kids that God allows us to love.
[time=802] Our hope is that we would all contribute to that. West Wing Edition, over on this end, a facility that would house mainly children's ministry,
[time=811] preschool ministry, at least initially it would house this, a chance to really increase our capability and expand the opportunity that we have to minister to little ones,
[time=821] and those that come with little ones, namely their families, and that's the West Wing.
[time=826] Compassion, ministry, go fund, 300,000 dollars, so very grateful, so very grateful that we have this in the project.
[time=836] A 300,000 dollar fund that would allow you and I to go.
[time=841] That would allow you and I to actually get mobile and go and help those that Jesus referred to in Matthew 25 as the least of these.
[time=850] And the least of these are those that are hungry. The least of these are those that are cold. The least of these are those that are thirsty.
[time=858] The least of these are those that don't know where their next meal is coming from. They may be in the midst of disease.
[time=863] They may be in the midst of poverty. They may be in the midst of crisis. You know what? They may be here in Fort Wayne.
[time=869] They might be in your neighborhood. They could be in Biloxi. There's a bunch of them over in Nairobi, little babies at a place called New Life Home Trust,
[time=878] where we were this past June and we're going to go back and we hope you'll come. It could be in a vulnerable.
[time=884] The number of pastors living still under the poverty level. It could be anywhere.
[time=890] I'm so thrilled that we would put aside a fund like this so that you and I could go to them and encourage them, walk alongside them, do what we can with resources, yes, but also our own hearts and lives and our own willingness to give ourselves.
[time=905] That's the Compassion Ministry Go Fund. Practice auxiliary gym. One more gym, which is desperately needed.
[time=912] 21 athletic teams here at Black Hawk Christian Elementary, junior high and high school. Space is at a premium.
[time=919] Practices are difficult to schedule. It would be an enormous boost to not only our athletic department, but our fine arts department as well.
[time=926] The dramas and the musicals that take place in those same rooms. So it's really a multi-purpose room gain on our part.
[time=933] And then BCS satellite opportunity. The chance, if we could get there to kind of put those funds toward exploration of the idea of possibly seeing satellite Black Hawk Christian school elementary sites and the different quadrants of the city,
[time=949] allowing us to expand our reach and our ministry into the hearts and lives of little ones and their families.
[time=956] So that's kind of the six. Again, most importantly to me is that you and I would ask the question, why?
[time=964] Why would we do all of that? And that to many of you, and I've had some great conversations. Thank you for the honest, thoughtful and sincere questions that you've asked.
[time=975] Thank you for being willing to voice with me some of the struggles that you've had. That is an enormous picture.
[time=982] Seven point five million dollars is an enormous amount of money. I think to many of us, it just seems way, way beyond, you know, anything that we could ever as a family achieve.
[time=995] I think there were some of you who wondered, you know, the wisdom behind putting such an enormous figure out there.
[time=1002] And I said it a few times and I know no matter how many times I've said it, I know that there are those who probably would just maybe need to hear me say it again.
[time=1011] We labeled that the dream and we had no problem kind of sharing with you our family that if you that if you sat us down and if you got our hearts together and if we were able to say to you, this would be our dream.
[time=1026] This would be our hope. I mean, this would be something that would just we feel like with where God has led us.
[time=1031] This picture would be such an just a great, great picture of us being able to move in that direction. We had no problem laying that whole thing out for you. And that's what we did.
[time=1042] And the reason why is we believe all six of those components, all six of them directly affect our ability to train up and equip and raise up priests who will what, who will go.
[time=1061] We've been saying it for almost a year now, my friends, when God looks at the church, 1 Peter 2 says, when he looks at the church, he sees a people for his own possession, a chosen race, a royal priesthood.
[time=1077] And we have been for almost a year now trying to help you. We have been trying to search the scriptures. We have been doing our very best to be more and more and more about training up priests who would go young priests and old priests and rich priests and poor priests and black priests and brown priests
[time=1097] and yellow and white priests and uneducated priests and educated priests. I mean, across the board, it has been our desire to be more and more placed committed to investing in you, teaching you and training you and encouraging you and giving you opportunities to fulfill your priestly function.
[time=1119] First Peter 2, 9, why don't you look there real quick. Let me just remind you of what it says there. Here we see God looking at the church here. Peter writes to the church. Yes, he makes an Old Testament reference, but in this passage, we see God, if you will, in essence, kind of putting his beginning to put his arm around proclaiming and announcing in essence
[time=1138] that his arms are now going around the whole. All of us, you are Peter writes to the church, to you and to me, he says in verse 9, but you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession.
[time=1159] You are a chosen race, not race as a race, a royal priesthood, a people for God's own possession, who do what? What is it that priests do? What is the priestly function of a royal priesthood, a people for God's own possessions? What do they do? Look at verse 9 there, keep going.
[time=1180] So that you may proclaim the excellencies of him, who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. There you go.
[time=1190] Priests, my friends, proclaim the excellencies of God. Having met with God, priests were intimately related to. Priests were intimately connected to God.
[time=1202] Priests, we've said it before, having met with God, they would be about passing God along to others. Priests are human reflections of the divine and priests we've studied, and we've looked at it before, don't sit still. That's right.
[time=1217] They don't settle in, they don't play it safe, they don't sit back. Those who represent God, priests, Christ followers, disciples, Matthew 28, 19, Jesus said, when it was all said and done, and it was time for them to be who God had called them to be.
[time=1231] When he was leaving and they were staying and the kingdom was at hand, he said, what? Go. He said, be mobile. Don't sit, move.
[time=1241] Take what I've given you, take what I've taught you, take what I've gifted you with, and fulfill your priestly function, priests that go.
[time=1250] So over these last several weeks, I've asked every one of you to prayerfully consider a significant sacrificial gift that would allow us to experience as big a chunk of that $7.5 million dream as God would allow.
[time=1268] And I think it's important for me to restate this and to say this again to you. Again, this is something I have communicated, this is something I've written it, I've emailed it, I've had the hallway conversations, I've stood here and said it to you, but I think it's good for me to say it to you again.
[time=1283] Our goal has not been $7.5 million. Our goal from day one has been your very best gift and mine.
[time=1296] That's been our goal. Our goal is that every one of you that calls this place home, every one of you high school students, every one of you junior hires, every one of you individuals, families, couples, every one of you, that's a part of this
[time=1311] journey. We have said from day one that our goal on this would be your very best effort and mine. And for some of you, your very best effort on this.
[time=1324] We're talking about, we're talking about above and beyond giving. And I think it's important that we say this again too.
[time=1331] We're talking to you about tithes and offerings. What cement gives you an opportunity to make an offering. Tides, as Mitchell and I explained this to you recently, this is the ongoing giving.
[time=1344] There were just things that in God's design for this specific ministry needed to be given. It's just part of being a part of this family. There is the regular ongoing giving that you and I do on a regular basis.
[time=1358] And those gifts go to the ministry and the ongoing everyday needs of a ministry inside and outside these four walls. And that giving has got to continue. We have got to be as a family faithful to that.
[time=1371] That is not to be affected in any way, shape, or form by this. This is what we would call offerings. This gift that we're asking you to consider making. This is above and beyond.
[time=1385] This is free will. This is from your heart. This is what you could do between you and God and maybe your spouse or family. What could you do in an above and beyond type way?
[time=1397] That might be $250 over three years. That could be $250,000 over three years. It could be anywhere in between.
[time=1413] And this is all that we've been talking about. This is the way we've been pointing you in your thinking. We've been directing as a family you toward next Sunday and a day that we've referred to as commitment Sunday.
[time=1425] And it's the Sunday coming up next week where we're asking all of you to come prepared to make your commitment. Whatever that might be.
[time=1435] And I want to say this to you. I'm really thankful. We've been talking to you about a willingness on your part to come and to make an above and beyond gift a pledge.
[time=1445] And we've been talking to you about that for the last, you know, three, four weeks.
[time=1450] We've been talking, I want you to know, with our leadership. I mean as elders and staff members and small group leaders and deacons and leaders in classes and our school staff and our church staff.
[time=1463] I mean across the board, I mean those that give leadership to this place and they may have a title or they may not, but they've got a vested interest in this place.
[time=1473] And they help us on a regular basis. In one way or the other leadership. We've been talking with them for a lot longer period of time than we've been talking to you and they've been asked to consider making a gift.
[time=1489] And I'm so thankful because we're, you know, we're on our way down this road and I have no idea where this is going to end up, but I want you to know as a family.
[time=1498] And I want you to be encouraged that over a hundred leaders have responded. I think a hundred and one.
[time=1505] And there's probably more of those that are still kind of making their way in. But as if I think Friday, we had heard from a hundred and one leaders here in the Blackhawk family.
[time=1517] The total pledged from those one hundred and one was one million four hundred thousand almost almost one point five million dollars.
[time=1527] By amen. Absolutely. Amen and praise God. And that's an enormous amount. I'm not just think about that for a moment. Go ahead and think about them a million five.
[time=1539] This place, I mean contrary to what some think and believe me, I've heard it.
[time=1545] This place isn't crawling with people who have thousands of dollars every month to just give away and do whatever they want with.
[time=1555] Our school isn't filled with people like that. Our church isn't filled with people like that.
[time=1561] That one point four three nine seven hundred and twenty three, that's a sacrifice. I'll tell you that on the part of a lot of folks who give a great deal of their time and talent to this place.
[time=1573] And I want that to be an encouragement to you. And I just want to use that as a means to encourage you to keep thinking about where you'll go with this opportunity and the days to come.
[time=1583] I'm going to ask you to come back. We've been saying it for a few weeks next week and make your commitment.
[time=1588] And I've been thinking about that phrase and this is what I want to talk to you about today.
[time=1593] I've been thinking about that phrase coming in making your commitment, make your commitment.
[time=1601] The more I've thought about it, the more I've kind of chewed on it. I think I'd maybe say that differently to you this morning and I want you to bear with me.
[time=1609] I know when we talk about money. I know when we talk about giving. I know when we talk about cash. I know sometimes.
[time=1618] I've been here for 12 years. I've been standing here for eight every Sunday I've ever taught on giving. Somebody gets up and leaves.
[time=1625] Literally. It usually ticks somebody off. And I think usually it does because of how the subject matter has been so abused in the church for so many years.
[time=1637] You're sitting there thinking I got to go to the restroom. He's going to think I'm ticked.
[time=1645] So if you get up and leave today, just give me a little hand sign. Just kind of do that as you're walking out and I'll know you're not mad at me.
[time=1652] But what I want to be sensitive, I'm going to make a statement here and I want to be sensitive with you because I think it could be easily misunderstood.
[time=1659] I'm going to try my best to talk you through it but I want to make the statement.
[time=1662] I don't think next Sunday is a chance for you to come make your commitment.
[time=1667] The more I've been considering it, I think it's a chance for you to come show, not to me.
[time=1674] Because I won't know.
[time=1677] To him.
[time=1679] Your commitment.
[time=1682] To show.
[time=1684] To evidence.
[time=1686] Your commitment.
[time=1688] Because commitment, my friends, I believe commitment is all about heart.
[time=1695] And the Lord said where your treasure is, there we will find your what? Your heart.
[time=1706] There we will find your heart.
[time=1707] Now you might be sitting there already going away to me, Kelly.
[time=1709] Are you saying that a wet cement pledge is the only way to show my commitment to God?
[time=1714] No.
[time=1715] I'm not saying that.
[time=1717] I'm saying your wet cement pledge is A, is A way for you to show or evidence your commitment
[time=1725] to God.
[time=1726] You evidence your commitment to God when you love your wife the way Christ loved the church.
[time=1731] You evidence or show your commitment to God when you respect your husband in a supportive
[time=1738] kind and uplifting way.
[time=1740] You evidence your commitment to God when you honor your parents.
[time=1747] You evidence your commitment to God when you rake the leaves in the yard of an aging couple next door.
[time=1753] You evidence your commitment to God when you work hard at your job and support your family when you make time to meet with God and read and meditate on his scriptures and pray prayers of confession and adoration.
[time=1766] You show your commitment to God in a number of ways.
[time=1770] All of those would be potential indicators of your commitment to him and in the same way the amount of money.
[time=1779] I believe in the very same way the amount of money that you're willing to sacrificially part with, not conveniently part with and not even necessarily comfortably part with.
[time=1794] And the amount of money that you're willing to sacrificially part with for God honoring
[time=1800] kingdom advancing.
[time=1802] In some cases life saving opportunities like the ones you saw on that screen.
[time=1808] I think that is an indicator and opportunity for you to evidence your commitment to him.
[time=1816] Let's think about this word commitment this morning.
[time=1820] Let's look at it, can we?
[time=1822] Maybe you might want to just ask yourself the question, very private discussion between you and him.
[time=1826] I think it's an opportunity for you and I to collectively kind of bring the reality of our lives today into his presence and into his scope, if you will.
[time=1837] How committed are you?
[time=1839] Not to me, not to a building, not to a ministry, but how committed are you really to him?
[time=1846] I wrote this down.
[time=1847] How is your commitment level these days?
[time=1852] What does it mean?
[time=1853] Write this down.
[time=1854] I think it's a great, very simple, very profound definition.
[time=1857] Commitment.
[time=1858] You look it up in the dictionary, there you have it.
[time=1859] To be faithful and unwavering to a cause.
[time=1864] To be faithful and unwavering.
[time=1866] To be true and steadfast to a cause and that cause may be your marriage.
[time=1872] That cause may be your kids.
[time=1874] That cause may be an organization that you're a part of.
[time=1877] We make commitments all the time.
[time=1879] In this case, in the context of our discussion today, I'd like you to think about your commitment
[time=1885] to him.
[time=1886] To be faithful to him.
[time=1888] To be unwavering in your commitment to this cause that you and I have given ourselves to, of bringing honor and glory to God, this cause of following Christ.
[time=1899] It's interesting, when you look up commitment in Webster's, a few bullet points down, two
[time=1905] or three down, it says commitment.
[time=1907] Something pledged.
[time=1909] I thought that was interesting.
[time=1912] Something pledged.
[time=1914] Commitment means to be both emotionally and physically.
[time=1917] Write that down.
[time=1918] To be both emotionally and physically devoted to a course of action or a way of thinking.
[time=1925] Now think back with me for a moment.
[time=1927] Let's make this interactive.
[time=1930] Let's make this real and let's kind of get our hands on it.
[time=1933] Get back with me through some of you have been studying this book for a lot of years.
[time=1939] Some of you, you know this really well and I'm so thankful that so many of you are doing your very best to live it out with his help.
[time=1947] Others of you are kind of just getting used to it, so don't let this intimidate you.
[time=1950] Have fun with this.
[time=1951] I just want you to maybe get with a couple of folks around you if you would be okay with it.
[time=1957] If not, don't sweat it.
[time=1958] Just sit and enjoy.
[time=1959] But those of you that would be open to it, I want you to get out your Bibles and you don't have to necessarily turn.
[time=1964] Just talk about some people, let's start in the Old Testament.
[time=1968] Start in the Old Testament and just kind of just with some people around you, identify, name some individuals who were really, really committed, unwavering, faithful in their commitment
[time=1982] to what God had called them to emotionally and physically devoted to a course of action.
[time=1989] Alright, just take a few seconds, talk to somebody nearby, come up with a name of somebody from the Scriptures, Old Testament, really, really, really, really committed.
[time=2020] Alright, good, pens down.
[time=2028] Alright, somebody raise your hand.
[time=2032] Somebody, just give me a name right here, red sweater.
[time=2036] Noah, are you kidding me?
[time=2037] Were you in first hour?
[time=2039] First person, first hour said Noah, alright, hands down for a second.
[time=2043] First person, first hour said Noah, and now she says Noah, Noah, people.
[time=2049] Think about that.
[time=2051] Think about being devoted to a course of action.
[time=2054] God said build a boat, no, he didn't say build a boat, God said build a ship.
[time=2057] This thing was titanic-ish.
[time=2060] This thing was huge in a place where it didn't rain and it hadn't rained for years and he knew he would be the laughingstock and he was and he was abused.
[time=2069] He was verbally and emotionally and I'm sure maybe even physically abused.
[time=2075] We built it because God said what, build a what, build a boat.
[time=2082] Great, great, great, great.
[time=2083] Somebody else, hand out in the back, Roland, Daniel, maybe 12 or 13 years old, maybe 14,
[time=2093] taken captive by a maniac, kidnapped away from his home, 14, 1500 miles, taken into captivity
[time=2103] for the sole purpose of an enormous old fashioned brainwashing.
[time=2111] And he had obviously been built into.
[time=2116] Somebody had obviously invested into this young man's heart and mind and soul because when the crazed king who had him in captivity said to him, look, I'm going to do something
[time=2126] good here.
[time=2127] I'm going to make you into something.
[time=2128] I'm going to give you a new name and I'm going to give you new food and I'm going to give you new wine.
[time=2132] I'm going to have you eat at my table.
[time=2134] I'm going to give you all this stuff.
[time=2138] He says what, no thanks.
[time=2142] I'll respectfully decline.
[time=2144] I'll stick with my name even if it's in my own heart.
[time=2148] I'll go with the bread and water and I'm going to just do my very best to be who I know God
[time=2155] called me to be.
[time=2156] Wow.
[time=2158] Huge commitment.
[time=2163] Faithful unwavering.
[time=2165] Somebody else.
[time=2166] Back in the back.
[time=2167] Ron.
[time=2168] God.
[time=2169] Very committed.
[time=2170] Absolutely.
[time=2171] Thank you, Carl.
[time=2172] God is one of the most committed ever, right?
[time=2175] Amen?
[time=2176] Good job, Carl.
[time=2177] Somebody else.
[time=2178] Right here.
[time=2179] Jesus.
[time=2180] Awesome.
[time=2181] Very good, Tammy.
[time=2182] I think Jesus was committed.
[time=2183] Unwavering.
[time=2184] Faithful.
[time=2185] Yes, right here.
[time=2186] Mary.
[time=2187] There you go.
[time=2188] Going to the New Testament.
[time=2189] Give me a few more.
[time=2190] Tony.
[time=2191] Esther.
[time=2192] Absolutely.
[time=2193] Oh my goodness.
[time=2194] Esther.
[time=2195] I got a going record here saying that the veggie tales deal on Esther is one of the best
[time=2207] ever.
[time=2209] Anybody want to say amen to that?
[time=2211] That's a great veggie tale.
[time=2212] It's the one on Esther.
[time=2214] We can talk about it later.
[time=2216] Esther, up against it, huge stakes.
[time=2220] Huge big stakes, and she just stays true to what she knew was right.
[time=2227] Sandy.
[time=2228] Paul.
[time=2229] Did you say Paul?
[time=2230] Yeah, possible.
[time=2231] Paul.
[time=2232] Acts 14.
[time=2235] You can write that down.
[time=2237] We've talked about it before.
[time=2239] Lestra.
[time=2240] In Lestra, Acts 14, Paul did what God called Paul to do.
[time=2245] Paul proclaimed what was true and right and good, and they killed him.
[time=2251] They dragged him by his hair out to a pile of dirt on the outside of the city, and they
[time=2258] stoned him.
[time=2259] They threw boulders on his head and killed him.
[time=2263] And God miraculously brings him back to life.
[time=2269] He gets up, he brushes himself off, and he submits his resignation letter from the ministry
[time=2277] right there.
[time=2278] Right?
[time=2279] Says, "I'm done." Thanks for the second chance.
[time=2283] I'm not going through that ever again.
[time=2286] No.
[time=2287] He goes to a place called Iconium, and there he proclaims and preaches that, which is true
[time=2293] and right and good.
[time=2294] And here's the best part.
[time=2295] I've told you this before.
[time=2296] After Iconium, he has to go back to where he had started, so he just figures he might as well stop by Lestra and see how they're doing.
[time=2307] It's huge, my friends.
[time=2308] We've said it a number of different ways.
[time=2310] I want to remind you of this phrase today, all in, all in, everything.
[time=2318] Everything I have is yours, God.
[time=2320] Everything.
[time=2321] My obedience, my devotion, my faithfulness, my resources, my heart, my commitment to you, all of it on the table, all of it there, nothing in my pockets.
[time=2333] I don't have a dime left in me here.
[time=2336] I'm taking all of it and putting it on the table and saying there, "I'm yours, devoted,
[time=2344] devoted." I'll tell you what.
[time=2346] And I know I've mentioned this place before over the years in maybe two or three other
[time=2352] illustrations.
[time=2353] I'm really not a huge Notre Dame fan, okay?
[time=2356] I'm not, I have no huge loyalties.
[time=2358] I'll tell you what I saw this weekend.
[time=2360] My wife and my son were up there visiting Notre Dame and we were there on Friday and
[time=2366] we spent the day touring the campus and meeting different people and going to different places and it was really, it's an astonishing place.
[time=2372] We had a great, great time.
[time=2374] And Russell T and Kevin and I, we had dinner there on campus and then they're kind of scurrying us back to the athletic center there, the joy center and we're kind of in a hurry and I'm asking the guy what the big hurry is and he says, "Oh, it's Friday night.
[time=2389] It's the pepperale." And I'm thinking, "Wow, all right." So they scoot us in a back door and down the hallway and all of a sudden we're in the joy center.
[time=2397] It's filled.
[time=2398] There's 11,000 people in there and they're going absolutely ballistic and that, that
[time=2404] fight song, it's a decent fight song, the 38th time it gets a little annoying.
[time=2408] But that fight, the entire band, the band is in the joy center.
[time=2412] The marching band is in the joy center.
[time=2414] They're playing that thing, the roof is just shaking.
[time=2419] On the way there, I guess that Notre Dame, the dorms and the dorms, it's a big thing that they don't have a Greek system, no fraternities and no sororities.
[time=2427] So your dorm is it and the dorms all get dressed up in different colors and combinations
[time=2433] and they march from their dorms to the joy center for the pepperale.
[time=2439] And it was just absolutely crazy, now they're all in this place and the band's playing, the place is going nuts and they stop and the lights go out in the football team.
[time=2447] They put us in the front row for this thing.
[time=2449] The football, Charlie Weiss and the football team, they come marching out.
[time=2452] People are just screaming and yelling.
[time=2455] You can't even hear yourself thinking.
[time=2456] The music stops and Paul Horning's there.
[time=2459] Paul Horning's over in the bleachers and he brought 28 firefighters from New York City who fought fire in 9/11 and the place goes crazy and they, play God bless America and they're playing Navy the next day and a kid on the football team who's the Navy ROTC at Notre Dame gives the speech and the place goes crazy and a coach gets up and then Charlie
[time=2479] Weiss gets up and he gets done and the music kicks back in and you're just drained by
[time=2485] the time you get out and we're walking out, we're outside, we finally get a deep breath and I turn to my son and I say they're one in seven.
[time=2496] They're stinking one and seven.
[time=2502] One and seven.
[time=2503] Well they're one and eight now.
[time=2509] It's just commitment.
[time=2511] It's just raw, we're in and I wasn't trying to be funny.
[time=2516] Circumstantially, one and seven.
[time=2519] All in, what was it, here's a question for you, what was it that kept others from being
[time=2529] all in, in the Scriptures?
[time=2531] I'd have you talk about this but let me just kind of take you through this.
[time=2535] Think about, I want you to think about it though, think about the stories of Scripture
[time=2541] and think about those that didn't do so well.
[time=2545] Think about those who when it came to their commitment, the faithful unwavering devotion to a cause.
[time=2551] Think about those who dropped the ball.
[time=2555] Think about a few who allowed something to come in between them and commitment.
[time=2563] I don't know who comes to your mind.
[time=2566] More than names, I want you to write down this morning three things.
[time=2570] I want every one of you to write down three things that I think and I think the Scriptures clearly teach.
[time=2574] There's three things.
[time=2575] There could be six or seven.
[time=2576] Three things this morning but I think keep you and I from being all in.
[time=2582] Here you go, Joshua 6.
[time=2585] Open up if you would, to Joshua chapter 6.
[time=2588] Back in the Old Testament, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua.
[time=2593] Go to Joshua chapter 6 and look at verse 17, Joshua 6, 17.
[time=2598] Here you go.
[time=2600] This is God dealing with Joshua, the people of Israel.
[time=2603] He's taking them into the land and now they're going to conquer Jericho.
[time=2607] Remember Jericho, the huge walled fortified city?
[time=2611] The city shall be under the ban, God says.
[time=2613] They're going to shout and the walls are going to come down.
[time=2617] Verse 17, the city it says, "The city shall be under the ban.
[time=2621] It and all that is in it, Jericho, belongs to the Lord.
[time=2625] Only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in the house shall live because she hid the messengers whom we sent, but as for you Joshua and as for you Israel.
[time=2637] Only keep yourselves from the things under the ban so that you do not covet them and
[time=2643] take some of the things under the ban and make the camp of Israel accursed and bring
[time=2651] trouble on it, but all the silver and all the gold and all the articles of bronze and
[time=2657] iron are holy to the Lord, set apart, consecrated, and they shall go into the treasury of the
[time=2664] Lord and not into your what?" Pocket.
[time=2668] So he clearly lays this out.
[time=2671] 7-1.
[time=2672] Go to chapter 7, verse 1, "It didn't go so well.
[time=2676] The sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the things under the ban.
[time=2682] For Aiken, the son of Karmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zara, from the tribe of Judah took some of the things under the ban, therefore the anger of the Lord burned against the sons
[time=2693] of Israel." And later in 7 they go to battle.
[time=2696] Later in 7 the nation of Israel goes to battle at a place called I, A-I, and they outnumber
[time=2704] their foe.
[time=2705] They are completely better and more trained and skilled than their foe and the foe slaughters them.
[time=2712] And Israel turns their backs and runs scared, demoralized, defeated there at I.
[time=2720] Look at chapter 7, verse 10, "Joshua was absolutely distraught, so the Lord says to
[time=2726] Joshua, 'Rise up, why is it that you have fallen on your face?
[time=2730] Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant, which I commanded them.
[time=2735] And they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived
[time=2741] more over.
[time=2742] They have also put them among their own things, therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies.
[time=2748] They turn their backs before their enemies, for they have become accursed.
[time=2752] I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the things under the ban from your
[time=2759] midst because I'm God.
[time=2761] And it's not that I'm mean, it's not that I'm heartless, I just hate it when things come in between me and my people."
[time=2772] When you hear people say, or when you hear the Scriptures say, "He's a jealous God," that's exactly what He means.
[time=2780] Rise up, consecrate the people, and say, "Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow," for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, "There are things under the ban in your midst, O Israel.
[time=2790] You cannot stand before your enemies until you have removed the things under the ban from your midst." So, they do.
[time=2797] They go through this process of kind of weeding out different possibilities who it was.
[time=2802] Look at verse 18, "He brought His household near man by man and Aiken, son of Karmy, son
[time=2809] of Zabdi, son of Zara from the tribe of Judah was taken.
[time=2813] Then Joshua said to Aiken, "My son, I implore you, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and give praise to Him, and tell me now what you have done.
[time=2822] Do not hide it from me." So Aiken answered Joshua and said, "Truly, I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and this is what I did." Now listen, listen, because this isn't just Aiken, this is me, this isn't just Aiken,
[time=2841] this is you, this is what happens, this is what keeps you and I from being all in so many
[time=2848] times, when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinaar and 200 shekels of silver,
[time=2858] because I'm just Aiken, you know, I don't have very much.
[time=2862] When I saw the spoil, when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinaar and 200 shekels of silver and a bar of gold, 50 shekels in weight, then I coveted them.
[time=2873] I coveted them, dog gone, and I want that.
[time=2878] I don't have that, and I want that.
[time=2882] And I took them, and behold, they are concealed in the earth inside my tent with the silver
[time=2888] underneath it.
[time=2891] One of the reasons, one of the things that keeps you and I from being all in is the lust for more stuff.
[time=2897] Write that down.
[time=2899] The lust for more stuff.
[time=2902] We want more pleasure.
[time=2904] We want more things.
[time=2905] We want more fun.
[time=2907] We want more providence.
[time=2909] And God's message that day to Aiken, let me remind you, we won't read it, but let me just remind you, Aiken didn't live.
[time=2917] Aiken didn't see the next day, in order to his family.
[time=2923] And what God is saying there to Aiken and what God was saying to the people of Israel was, "You know what?
[time=2928] I've got you covered.
[time=2929] I'm going to provide for you.
[time=2931] I will take care of you.
[time=2932] I have always taken care of you.
[time=2934] I will take care of you today, and I will always take care of you in the future.
[time=2939] Don't go outside the parameters of what I've provided.
[time=2943] Be so very careful that you don't let this stuff, that you covet, come in between you and me and the covenant relationship that I've established." The lust for more stuff.
[time=2954] Secondly, write this down, pride and disobedience.
[time=2958] Pride and the disobedience that so oftentimes comes with it.
[time=2964] Look at 1 Samuel 15, just a few pages over, go to 1 Samuel 15, here I want to show you a little bit about a guy named Saul, King Saul, oh I'm telling you, this guy was an anointed leader, he was a blessed man of God, he was powerful, gifted, able, both physically
[time=2980] and spiritually, and in his leadership gift, he was an incredibly gifted guy.
[time=2986] And God had made him king over Israel, and Saul had come to a place of great power and great prominence.
[time=2992] Look at 1 Samuel 15, too, if you would, it says, "Thus says the Lord of hosts, 'I will
[time=2998] punish Amalek for what he did, God's going to bring retribution on a nation and its leader
[time=3005] for what they had done.
[time=3006] I'm going to punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he set himself up, how he set himself against him on the way while he was coming up from Egypt.
[time=3015] The Amalekites had inflicted on speakable evil and mistreatment on the people of Israel,
[time=3021] and God says to Saul, 'You are going to now destroy them, I am sending you to destroy
[time=3027] them.' And God says to Saul, 'In no uncertain terms that when you get there, you are to Saul, you are to destroy them.' And you can read it on your own, he says, 'You are to leave nothing, you are to completely
[time=3042] wipe them out.' And these people had done all kinds of things, unspeakable stuff to the people of Israel.
[time=3052] And so Saul goes and he engages in battle, and you know what, all of a sudden Saul thinks he's got a better idea.
[time=3058] Look at 15-9.
[time=3060] But Saul and the people, instead of killing the king Agag, they spare Agag, and the Baleko,
[time=3067] here we go.
[time=3068] And the best of the sheep, and the best of the oxen, and the best of the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was what, say it.
[time=3076] And they were not willing to destroy them, what, utterly.
[time=3081] But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.
[time=3087] And this is just says, it's just hard to read.
[time=3091] This isn't funny at all, but when I read it, I do kind of laugh sometimes because it feels like you're talking to a 13-year-old.
[time=3097] And if you've ever talked to a 13-year-old who got busted, you'll get a little chuckle out of this.
[time=3102] So verse 12, "Profit Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, and it was told Samuel
[time=3108] saying Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a, oh no, he set up a monument for
[time=3115] himself.
[time=3116] Sound like some pride?
[time=3120] Then turned and proceeded on down to Gilgal, Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him,
[time=3127] 'Blessed are you of the Lord, Saul sees him coming, I think he knew something was up.
[time=3133] Most of them do, right?
[time=3135] Blessed are you of the Lord, I have carried out the command of the Lord.' But Samuel said, 'What then is this bleeding of the sheep in my ears?
[time=3145] Samuel hears the, he hears the sheep, and the lowing of the oxen, which I hear.'
[time=3152] And Saul said in typical Adam fads, like we're back in the garden, they immediately, they
[time=3159] have brought them.' It wasn't me, Samuel, they brought them from the Amalekites, and not only did they bring them, I know they weren't supposed to, but listen, listen, listen, here's why we were disobedient, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the Lord your God, but the rest, the rest, we have utterly destroyed.
[time=3178] My dad, I did most of the job that you sent me out to do, how about you?
[time=3188] You know what Saul did here basically, we can summarize it like this, he had a better plan, his plan, his plan, his idea, how he thought this thing should go, just thought
[time=3198] it was better than what God had said to do, he even came up with a way to have it make sense, but it wasn't what God said he should do.
[time=3208] And when you think you have a better plan, pride, so many times it leads to disobedience,
[time=3215] and you and me both deviating from what God said, do, pride and disobedience, third, write
[time=3221] this down, fear.
[time=3223] You know what so many times gets in the way of you being all in with him, fear.
[time=3232] What will they think?
[time=3234] What will they say?
[time=3235] How will they treat me?
[time=3237] What will happen to me?
[time=3238] Where is this thing going to go?
[time=3240] How am I going to be viewed?
[time=3242] Fear, fear of what might happen, fear of what they might say, John 18, 17.
[time=3246] I don't know who comes to your mind.
[time=3248] When you think about those in the scriptures who let fear get the best of them, my mind
[time=3254] went immediately to our friend Peter, says in John 18, 17, "The Lord Jesus has been taken
[time=3260] captive.
[time=3261] This thing is going downhill fast.
[time=3263] You can just smell the blood in the air.
[time=3265] He's gone before the Sanhedrin, a few of the disciples are now just kind of hanging around the peripheral.
[time=3269] And now all of a sudden the slave girl who kept the door said to Peter, "You.
[time=3274] You are not also one of this man's disciples.
[time=3277] Are you?" And he said, "I am what not." Peter, Peter who'd seen it all, Peter who hadn't missed much of anything, Peter who had seen
[time=3288] the miraculous strength and power of the Lord, Peter who had seen the Lord come through
[time=3294] time and time and time again.
[time=3298] Scared to death.
[time=3299] Who me?
[time=3300] Uh-uh.
[time=3301] Nope.
[time=3302] Go on to verse 25.
[time=3303] And now Simon Peter was a few hours later.
[time=3306] Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself at the fire.
[time=3308] So they said to him, "You are not also one of his disciples.
[time=3312] Are you?" He denied it and said, "I am what?" Scared to death.
[time=3319] All in, not tonight.
[time=3320] I have no idea where this might go.
[time=3323] I'm going to play it safe.
[time=3325] Next one of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter
[time=3332] cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?" Verse 27.
[time=3338] Peter then denied it again and immediately a rooster crowed because Jesus had said before the next day, "You'll deny me how many times?" And he did.
[time=3347] Scared to death.
[time=3354] I don't want those things.
[time=3356] Hear me.
[time=3358] I just gave you those three things and it's not about your check next week.
[time=3363] It is not about your money.
[time=3366] I think it has implications.
[time=3369] Those three things keep you and me at times from full commitment.
[time=3376] And as far as your time and your talent and your treasure, I don't want those three things
[time=3383] keeping you from the fullness of all that God has in store for you.
[time=3387] So I'm asking you to trust him and to move forward with great commitment.
[time=3392] I want to say this to you.
[time=3394] Last week, Mitchell and I talked about death.
[time=3395] I think it's very important that you hear this.
[time=3398] I would love to see many, many of you that call this place home give a sacrificial pledge next week.
[time=3405] If you're in debt right now, I think the drama last week said they were swimming in debt.
[time=3411] If you're lost in debt, if you're in trouble financially, we don't want you to make a gift.
[time=3417] We don't want you to make a pledge.
[time=3419] We want to help you get out of debt.
[time=3422] And so please, if you'd allow us to help you, we can get you some budgetary counseling.
[time=3428] We can connect you with some people who could help you and encourage you in that.
[time=3432] We don't want you putting some card in the plate when you don't even have the means by which to cover your last visa bill.
[time=3440] And I know by saying that, you know, if the percentages are right, you know, that might take a bunch of you out.
[time=3447] I'll live with that because we want you to be healthy and free from that kind of bondage.
[time=3453] If you're able, if you're able, our hope and our prayer is that you give and that you'd give graciously.
[time=3460] If you've got questions about this, don't talk to it.
[time=3463] If you've got concerns about this, if you've got something that's kind of just doesn't feel right to you about this, come talk to us.
[time=3471] Come ask your questions, shoot me a note, stop me in the hallway.
[time=3477] But let's just, as a family, stay positive and grateful for this opportunity that God gives us.
