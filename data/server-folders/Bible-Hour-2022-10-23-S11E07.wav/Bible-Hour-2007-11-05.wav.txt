[time=8] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=15] [MUSIC]
[time=20] Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=28] [MUSIC]
[time=36] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.

[time=47] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.

[time=78] Deep within the heart has always known that there is freedom.
[time=89] Somehow breathe into the very soul of life.
[time=102] The prisoner, the powerless, the slave have always known it.
[time=114] There's something that keeps reaching for the sky.
[time=126] And even life begins because a baby fights for freedom.
[time=138] And the songs we love to sing have freedoms lead.
[time=150] So they'll fall through fire and fun to find the place of freedom.
[time=163] And some they tell itself for freedom's dream.
[time=174] There free of me, wherever I tell what it means to be.
[time=185] And change for freedom's dream, wherever I'm so clear.
[time=199] There free of me, wherever I tell what it means to be.
[time=235] God will freedom in to every fiber of creation.
[time=246] And he meant for us to all be free and hard.
[time=262] For freedom with the blood of his redemption, his cross stepped part of my name in the song.
[time=284] I'll sing it out with every breath, the breath, the whole world here is.
[time=359] For freedom with the whole world here, the whole world here, the whole world here, the whole world here, the whole world here.
[time=383] Let freedom echo all through the lonely streets, where prisons have no key.
[time=396] Can be free, and you can sing let freedom ring.
[time=423] Let freedom ring.
[time=435] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hug Ministries, and I want to welcome
[time=447] you again to the Bible Hour.
[time=449] We're really thankful, as always, that you've tuned in.
[time=452] If you've been watching over the last few weeks, then you know that we find ourselves now at the conclusion of what's been about a five-week series entitled "Wet Cement, Impressions
[time=463] for Life." Wet Cement is the name that we've given our recent capital campaign, a project that we've
[time=472] entered into with God's help, not only raise money, not only build buildings, but way more
[time=480] than those things, make an investment in the hearts and lives of people here and around the world.
[time=486] It is a huge project, and I have been so encouraged as I've watched God move in our family.
[time=492] And this Sunday that you're about to watch here on the broadcast, this was from last week when we had our commitment Sunday, a Sunday designated for our family, to make a commitment, a financial commitment, yes, a three-year pledge, but also a commitment
[time=508] of time and talent.
[time=510] We've been very clear with our people that this is not just about cash.
[time=515] This is about a renewed commitment on our part as a family to be absolutely and completely
[time=521] all in, to be willing and ready to serve inside and outside these four walls.
[time=526] A willingness to go, we've talked often about priests that go, and we want to encourage
[time=533] our people, and they make commitments to go to their neighborhoods, to Biloxi, to Nairobi.
[time=540] And then there is the chance as well to give financially.
[time=543] Now I want to make sure today that I don't leave you out, many of you are really a part of this family, and I want to give you the opportunity today.
[time=551] I told you several weeks ago I would, I want to give you the chance to make a commitment.
[time=556] If you go to our website, you can do this electronically.
[time=559] You can go to the website and click on the wet cement logo.
[time=564] And if you kind of just follow the instructions there, there's a way in which you can make a pledge.
[time=568] You may feel led of God today to make a pledge of $100 over a three-year span.
[time=575] God may have laid it on your heart to support us in a more significant way.
[time=579] Doesn't matter.
[time=580] All I want to know, all I want to do is make sure that you have been given the opportunity to give.
[time=586] We're so thankful for you.
[time=587] Thankful for your partnership, thankful for the encouragement that you give us.
[time=591] Every time we see you out and about, thankful for the notes that you write.
[time=596] And we want to do our very best to continue to allow the Bible hour and all that God is doing at Blackhawk to be all that it can be.
[time=604] And your help would be greatly appreciated.
[time=607] Thank you for all that you do.
[time=609] Thanks for the partnership that we have.
[time=611] If you have any questions at all about other ways in which maybe you could be of help or assistance as what cement impressions for life moves forward, please don't hesitate to give us a call.
[time=622] Thanks so very much.
[time=623] Have a great week.
[time=624] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=645] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=685] In Jesus' name, we are changed, we are called, we are chosen, adopted and named.
[time=697] In Jesus' blood, we are loved, we are healed.
[time=703] We're forgiven and free of our shame.
[time=709] We want to show you that we're thankful, what in your world with hope and peace, how
[time=722] to worship more than singing, giving redemption's hands and feet.
[time=733] We have been blessed.
[time=736] Now we're going to be a blessing.
[time=739] We have been loved, now we're going to bring love.
[time=745] We've been invited, going to share the invitation.
[time=751] We have been changed, to bring change, to bring change.
[time=764] Thank you Lord.
[time=766] Thank you for this new life.
[time=769] Thank you for the invitation.
[time=773] [MUSIC]
[time=783] God, we want to live in loud enough to shake our nations in your name.
[time=788] We have been saved, we're going to shout about the Savior.
[time=794] We have been loved, we're going to turn over every storm.
[time=800] We've been empowered to love the world to have.
[time=807] We have been changed, to bring change, to bring change.
[time=812] We have been changed, we have been changed, to bring change, to bring change.
[time=819] We have been changed, to bring change.
[time=826] To bring change.
[time=838] You know, singing that song that we sang there a little bit ago about being changed,
[time=844] there's a line in there I just love that talks about being rearranged.
[time=849] I don't know if you caught that word.
[time=851] You know, that's what happens to us.
[time=854] When we come to faith in Christ, we get spiritually and we get personally,
[time=861] we get literally rearranged.
[time=864] It's the amazing thing about redemption.
[time=867] It really is just one of the most incredible things about what takes place when God transforms us.
[time=874] We get changed, who we were and what we did and how we thought and all the shame and guilt we carried is gone.
[time=883] It's rearranged and He makes us sin.
[time=886] 2 Corinthians 5 says He makes us sin to a new creature, a new beginning.
[time=891] And that being changed, coming to faith in Christ, it is an amazing thing.
[time=898] And with this being commitment Sunday, most of you who call Black Hawk Home know that we've been in a five-week series and today is the last week of what we've called "wet cement impressions for life." And this is a day that we've set aside for you as a family to come.
[time=913] And on a number of fronts, make a commitment.
[time=917] And as we think about making a commitment, as we think about furthering with God's help, this ministry that He's given us, when I hear a song like that and I think about, you know, what this is really all about changed lives, I can't help but two things.
[time=937] I can't help but think about when He changed me.
[time=940] Where were you when He changed you?
[time=944] Do you remember?
[time=946] Where were you?
[time=947] What was going on in your life when He miraculously,
[time=953] lovingly, with such grace and mercy reached down and redeemed you?
[time=960] Remember that picture that we've seen before of Gomer?
[time=965] There's this amazing story of, you know, Hosea and Gomer and God wanted to show Israel His love for them.
[time=973] He wanted to exemplify His undying commitment to His people.
[time=977] And so He does so through the illustration of two real individuals, Hosea and his wife Gomer, and Gomer is a prostitute.
[time=986] And Gomer continues to pursue her trade.
[time=991] She continues to pursue unfaithfulness.
[time=994] She continues to pursue promiscuity.
[time=997] She leaves Hosea again and again and gives herself to other men.
[time=1002] And then as the story progresses, Hosea faithfully goes after Gomer to evidence and communicate his love for her.
[time=1009] He finds her literally being sold on the blocks as a slave, as a servant.
[time=1014] She's older, she's worn out, she's weary, and he buys her back.
[time=1022] Redemption.
[time=1025] Where were you when you got bought back?
[time=1029] Do you remember?
[time=1031] I hope you do.
[time=1032] And I want to say this this morning.
[time=1034] You know what?
[time=1035] I can't talk about commitment and all that God's doing here at Blackhawk without giving some of you the opportunity to at least think again about yours.
[time=1044] There are some in the room and you know how we feel about you.
[time=1047] We're really, really thankful for you.
[time=1049] You're here and you haven't made one yet.
[time=1052] You're still thinking through, you're still considering what it might be like to fully surrender your heart and life to Christ.
[time=1059] You're still giving thought to what it would mean to truly surrender, to become completely reoriented, rearranged, redeemed and changed, given a new life.
[time=1070] And I just want you to know again how grateful we are that you would entrust all of this, you know,
[time=1076] to us, this process of walking you through this, trying our best to teach and encourage you.
[time=1081] And as we make commitments this morning as a family, I just want to make sure you understand we're always, always, always hoping and praying that you might be willing to make that commitment to him.
[time=1091] And if we can help you, if you'd want to talk to us afterwards, if you'd want to have some dialogue with a trusted friend that you know could help, if you want to email us, call us, whatever you need to do,
[time=1102] whatever questions you might have, we want to do everything we can to help you make that commitment to be changed and rearranged.
[time=1110] For the rest of us, we have this morning the opportunity to do something that we talked about last week.
[time=1116] Last week I came and talked to you about this day and the chance that we would have as a family
[time=1122] to publicly in a sense and together make a commitment to something that God has put right before us,
[time=1128] and I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1130] Last week I kind of wanted to take your mind and your heart and your attention away from the project,
[time=1137] which I think is fine.
[time=1138] I'm really thankful for what's in it.
[time=1140] I'm thankful for all six of those components.
[time=1142] I am so thrilled at the vision that God has given us for those things.
[time=1146] I can't wait to see how He accomplishes them in His time and in His place.
[time=1152] And while I'm thankful for that project, you know, last week I said this is about so much more.
[time=1158] This is really about your commitment to Him.
[time=1163] This is really what means the most, you know, to me and to the leadership of this place,
[time=1170] your commitment to God.
[time=1174] And I asked you last week and I don't mind asking you again, how is it these days?
[time=1181] How are you, really, you and Him, your relationship with Him, your willingness to follow Him,
[time=1190] your closeness, your intimacy with Him, how is your heart, how is your mind,
[time=1196] how is your walk with Him on a regular basis?
[time=1199] Is it marked by?
[time=1200] Is it defined by commitment?
[time=1203] We defined it last week.
[time=1205] Maybe many of you wrote it down.
[time=1206] This is a very simple definition.
[time=1208] I'll show it to you again this morning, commitment, right there on the screen.
[time=1212] It is a faithful and unwavering to be faithful and unwavering to be faithful,
[time=1219] to say that this is what you're about and to follow through with that commitment,
[time=1225] to be faithful and unwavering to a cause.
[time=1228] And you could think of commitment as it relates to a number of different causes.
[time=1232] The cause that we're referring to this morning is this endeavor that God has called you
[time=1238] and I to to follow Him, to honor Him, to bring glory to Him.
[time=1242] And we talked about commitment being an unwavering, steadfast, persevering walk,
[time=1248] like God told the Israelites when the walls of Jericho came down.
[time=1252] He said, "I want you to walk straight in, not to the right or to the left, but straight."
[time=1260] Commitment, commitment, my friends, and yours, your commitment to Him,
[time=1267] probably one of the most important things that I think about, that I ponder, that I pray for.
[time=1273] And I gave you last week three, there could be six, there could be ten.
[time=1277] I gave you three things last week that keeps you and I from being all in.
[time=1283] We asked the question, "What keeps us from genuine commitment?
[time=1286] What keeps us as a family from being all in?" Absolutely and completely devoted to Him.
[time=1294] And we just had a really nice time.
[time=1296] It was really encouraging just going through the Scriptures because, you know, the Scriptures are filled with examples of those who were absolutely and utterly characterized
[time=1305] by commitment, of faithful, unwavering devotion to a cause.
[time=1313] And the Bible is also filled with a number of stories and illustrations of those that weren't,
[time=1320] that struggled with that very thing.
[time=1323] And so last week we just kind of tried our best to go through the Scriptures and we painted a picture of three things that can keep us from being fully and completely devoted, fully and completely committed to Him.
[time=1335] And I want to go back over those this morning as we continue to think about making a commitment
[time=1341] and more than that living out a commitment.
[time=1345] I want to go back to those three things that can keep us from commitment and I want to show you the flip side of those three things.
[time=1354] I want to show you what the opposite would be and I want to show you some instances, some actual illustrations from the Word of God that enable us to see real people
[time=1366] who lived real lives and who made real decisions that evidenced enormous commitment.
[time=1372] The first thing last week, the first barrier to commitment that we talked about was lust
[time=1379] for more stuff. Remember that?
[time=1382] We talked about how a lust, a desire for more stuff, more cash, more property, more luxury,
[time=1391] more fun, more toys, more destinations, more just all the stuff that you and I have thrown
[time=1399] in front of us every single day.
[time=1403] And I'm not just talking to rich people because we've already got that clarified, right?
[time=1408] We're all what? We're all rich.
[time=1411] Nobody gets to escape on this one.
[time=1414] You know, whether you've got to dime in the, you know, the ashtray in your car or whether you've got a couple million in the bank, again, we all have enormous opportunities today and we are all faced with the onslaught, the onslaught of temptation to move us toward
[time=1431] desiring more and more and more stuff.
[time=1434] And we saw in the Scripture a number of examples, one that we looked at last week was Aiken.
[time=1439] You can write it down if you missed it last week, Joshua chapter six and seven.
[time=1443] And what we saw with Aiken was that God had called Aiken in the Israelites to be committed to him.
[time=1449] God had called the Israelites to be devoted to him.
[time=1453] He wanted and he longed for their commitment.
[time=1456] As he moves them into the promised land, he says he's going to deliver them, the city called Jericho, these huge walled fortified city.
[time=1462] He said the walls are going to go down.
[time=1464] You're going to march around it seven times.
[time=1466] Shout, the trumpets are going to blow and the walls are going to go down.
[time=1469] And I want you now as a nation having encircled the city to go straight in.
[time=1474] And I will deliver these people to you and you will be victorious.
[time=1478] As you go straight in, he says you're going to notice everywhere you go, stuff.
[time=1484] It's going to be everywhere.
[time=1486] Don't go to the left.
[time=1487] Don't go to the right.
[time=1489] Walk straight.
[time=1490] Leave the stuff alone.
[time=1493] I'm your God.
[time=1494] I'll take care of you.
[time=1495] The stuff's going to be for me.
[time=1499] You walk straight.
[time=1501] The walls go down.
[time=1502] The people come in.
[time=1504] Joshua thinks it's a great day and all of a sudden things start going south for Israel.
[time=1508] Turns out, Aiken.
[time=1510] And when they confront him later, he says, remember, Joshua 7.
[time=1514] He says, I saw the mantle from Shinaar.
[time=1519] I saw that.
[time=1520] The gold.
[time=1521] I saw the shekels of silver.
[time=1523] I saw all the stuff.
[time=1525] And I, what did he say?
[time=1527] And I coveted it.
[time=1529] I wanted more.
[time=1533] And stuff gets in the way there between Aiken and his commitment to God.
[time=1538] Stuff comes in between him and his ability to be truly and purely devoted.
[time=1543] And see, that's the thing about stuff.
[time=1545] Don't get me wrong.
[time=1546] There isn't anything inherently evil about a nice car.
[time=1553] There isn't anything inherently evil with more things for your home or whatever we might be talking about.
[time=1560] It's just when they become a preoccupation.
[time=1565] And it's when you begin to think about and when you begin to plan about and when you begin to obsess on.
[time=1571] And when you begin to be so utterly and absolutely devoted to the next thing rather than being absolutely
[time=1578] and utterly devoted and focused and planning and thinking about him and what he has for you
[time=1586] and the opportunities he's given you to love and honor him and to serve those in your life.
[time=1591] Stuff.
[time=1592] The lust for more stuff.
[time=1594] Flipside.
[time=1596] Let's look at the flip side of that.
[time=1598] And the way I wrote it was this, contentment.
[time=1601] You want to exercise and experience a sweet commitment to him?
[time=1605] Then you and I have to learn to be a people who are content.
[time=1609] We have to exercise contentment with the kingdom in mind.
[time=1614] Contentment with the kingdom in mind of all the examples I could show you.
[time=1619] I mean the one I chose here this morning, I'm so thankful for this example and I'm so thankful for what we can glean from it.
[time=1626] Acts chapter two, let's look at a people who were content as it relates to stuff.
[time=1633] They didn't let stuff get in the way.
[time=1636] They allowed the provision of God and their love for God and their devotion to a cause to reign supreme.
[time=1644] And they had a very, very healthy kingdom oriented view of their stuff.
[time=1650] Look at Acts chapter two, pick it up in verse 42.
[time=1654] The church has just exploded, now a little backdrop.
[time=1657] The church is just taking off.
[time=1659] This is the beginning of the church.
[time=1661] God's tool, God's instrument to reach and redeem a dying world.
[time=1665] The church, it is exploding.
[time=1667] Jerusalem is absolutely just on fire.
[time=1670] I mean the God and the apostles and the teaching and the spirit of God now has come and amazing things are taking place.
[time=1677] And they were verse 32, they were the church.
[time=1680] They were continually devoting.
[time=1682] As you read this, you can just hear commitment and unwavering faithful devotion to a cause.
[time=1689] It just jumps off the page.
[time=1690] They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[time=1699] Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.
[time=1707] Here comes the stuff.
[time=1708] And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common.
[time=1716] And they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all as anyone might have need.
[time=1725] And I just want to remind you here.
[time=1727] Sometimes we have a view, I think, of the early church.
[time=1730] Sometimes we have a picture in our mind of how these poor people must have lived.
[time=1735] We oftentimes think of huddled believers in upper rooms kind of living from home to home and maybe not having much.
[time=1743] And you know, many of them maybe didn't have much.
[time=1746] But understand that there were those in the earliest days of the church who were believers who had land and possessions.
[time=1754] And that was all the stuff anybody could have ever had in those days.
[time=1760] And they were willing to live with contentment, contentment with the kingdom in mind, contentment with the church.
[time=1768] And it's progress in mind, contentment with their brothers and sisters in mind, day by day, verse 46.
[time=1776] We're selling the property and possessions and sharing them with all as anyone might have need, verse 46, day by day,
[time=1782] continuing with one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house.
[time=1787] They were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart.
[time=1793] And look where all this leads, praising God and having favor with all the people.
[time=1800] And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
[time=1808] I believe, I believe this picture of contentment.
[time=1812] I believe this obsession, and it was, it was an obsession, not with stuff,
[time=1820] not with the next purchase or the next trip.
[time=1823] No, these were a people who were obsessed with God and the kingdom and they were evidencing that commitment.
[time=1831] They were showing that as they lived out their faith, as they honored God and as they loved those around them,
[time=1838] and God was adding to their number day by day.
[time=1842] See, I think it's compelling for somebody on the outside looking in to see people
[time=1849] of all walks of life, red, yellow, black and white, rich, poor, educated, uneducated,
[time=1858] professional, white collar, blue collar, red collar, I think it's amazing.
[time=1864] And I think it's compelling for people on the outside looking in when they see a people for God's own possession,
[time=1872] a holy nation, a royal priesthood, living that kind, living out that kind of commitment to him and to each other.
[time=1883] And these folks were content, go over to four, just skip a chapter and go over to 432, Acts 4, 32,
[time=1890] and the congregation of those who believed were of one heart.
[time=1894] And it just breeds this unity and this togetherness, they were of one heart and soul and not one of them claimed
[time=1902] that anything belonging to him was his own.
[time=1907] We can use this often do.
[time=1909] I hear people using this often with their kids when they're talking about sharing, and that's a great, somewhat decent application.
[time=1916] I think it'd be a great thing for you and I as adults to read and to become more and more familiar with.
[time=1923] If nothing was theirs, nothing.
[time=1926] Not one of them claimed that anything really belonged to him was his own,
[time=1932] but all things were common property to them.
[time=1934] And with great power, the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus,
[time=1940] and abundant grace was upon them.
[time=1943] It was upon them all, for there was not a needy person among them for all who were owners.
[time=1951] Here comes the stuff, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them,
[time=1957] if need be, and bring the proceeds of the sales and lay them at the apostles' feet.
[time=1964] And they would be distributed to each as any head need.
[time=1969] It was an enormous commitment on their part, a huge opportunity to live, not guided by a lust for more stuff,
[time=1980] but a contentment, a contentment with the kingdom in mind.
[time=1987] That's what I want for you.
[time=1989] Whoever you are, however old you are, I want you to be able to live and face life, not mastered by, not governed by some unsasiable lust for a bigger, better thrill,
[time=2002] but guided and mastered by a deep internal commitment, a deep internal contentment as well that allows you to share, that allows you to give,
[time=2013] that allows you to freely offer in a way that meets needs and brings great glory and honor to him.
[time=2020] Secondly, last week we saw that pride, pride, and the way we said it was this,
[time=2026] pride and the disobedience that so often accompanies pride is something that can be a barrier
[time=2034] with respect to our commitment.
[time=2036] Pride and the disobedience that comes with it can so often times get in the way of my commitment to God being lived out in a God-honoring fashion.
[time=2046] We went to 1 Samuel 15, you can write that down, 1 Samuel 15.
[time=2050] We saw there a gentleman named Saul, an incredible guy, blessed of God, anointed by God,
[time=2056] big and stature, great leader, and God was beginning to use him in the nation of Israel, but the more and more success that Saul had, the more victories that he experienced,
[time=2067] the prouder and prouder, the more prideful his heart became.
[time=2072] And there is this instance back in 1 Samuel 15 where God said to Saul, "Look, I want you to go because of what they did.
[time=2079] I want you to go and destroy the Amalekites." Remember, last week we said that God's call on Saul was to utterly destroy the Amalekites,
[time=2088] completely, absolutely, thoroughly destroy them, God said.
[time=2091] So Saul goes with his men.
[time=2093] He actually takes off a little early.
[time=2096] Not only does he take off a little bit early, but then he goes and engages, and he destroys them, but he doesn't utterly destroy them.
[time=2103] Now, what he does is he takes some things for himself.
[time=2106] He saves the best of the sheep, the best of the cattle, the best of the gold, the best of all their stuff.
[time=2112] He destroys all the stuff that wasn't worth anything.
[time=2115] And then Samuel comes and confronts him, and then all of a sudden supposedly those things were not kept for himself, but he says we kept them to make a sacrifice and an offering to God.
[time=2127] And then before Samuel even got to him to confront him, you'll remember about halfway through chapter 15, Samuel had gone to look for him, and the folks that Samuel had bumped into and said, "Yeah, he was here. He erected an altar. He made a monument to himself,
[time=2145] and then left." And so right there we see this pride showing itself in even more aggressive ways, and God in the end removes the kingdom from Saul's power,
[time=2156] punishes Saul, pride, and the disobedience that so often accompanies it.
[time=2162] And it's so easy for you, and so easy for me.
[time=2166] It is so easy if we're not careful.
[time=2170] Pride, it's an insidious thing.
[time=2172] And you can begin to think of yourself, and I can begin to think of myself, and we can begin to be impressed with ourselves and our abilities, and what we're doing, and how we're working, and what we're accomplishing.
[time=2186] And there has got to be, in the every day, in the every moment of your life in mind, a willingness to be humble, the flip side, write that down, a humble obedience, not a pride, and the disobedience that so often accompanies it, but a humble obedience.
[time=2202] A humble obedience guarantees you and I, some free-flowing activity as it relates to us and our commitment to him, our attempt to be unwavering.
[time=2214] When that attempt to be unwavering to the cause is coupled with a humility of heart,
[time=2220] and the obedience that comes with that, oh boy, God does great things.
[time=2226] Think with me, we did this last week, and I want to just give you a chance to do it one more time here this morning.
[time=2232] Think about just however much of this you're familiar with.
[time=2237] No big deal, if it's just a little bit or if it's a bunch, no big deal.
[time=2241] Think about the individuals in the scriptures, and I want you to talk to somebody nearby,
[time=2247] and if you don't want to talk to somebody in your bites, no big deal.
[time=2250] But if you just take a moment and maybe just talk with some people around you, and just try to find in your mind somebody in here who was really humble,
[time=2260] not prideful.
[time=2262] Maybe they even had a, they would have had every reason to be prideful, you know, humanly speaking, but they weren't.
[time=2269] Think of somebody in here who was humble, and in their humility, we see them exercising great obedience.
[time=2278] And there's some real obvious ones, and that's fine if that's what you come up with, but kind of dig around a little bit in your mind or talk about it with somebody next to you, somebody who was humble, and that humility led to obedience which solidified
[time=2293] and intensified their commitment to God.
[time=2295] Go ahead, talk about it with somebody nearby.
[time=2303] [SILENCE]
[time=2323] Humble and obedient.
[time=2329] [SILENCE]
[time=2335] Right about this time, first hour, it was just absolutely hilarious.
[time=2338] First hour, I said, go ahead and talk, go ahead and talk amongst yourselves and come up with something.
[time=2343] I don't know what the deal was with first hour this morning.
[time=2346] It was just a little dead, and nobody was talking.
[time=2349] I mean, there were a few little whispers, right?
[time=2351] A little few whispers, but nobody was really talking, so I'm kind of just walking around going, "Yeah, I wish they'd start talking." No kidding, all of a sudden, this enormous clap of thunder.
[time=2360] [ Laughter ] I don't know where you were about an hour and a half ago, but there was that huge thunder roll that the roof shook, and I said to them, "He's upset with you." [ Laughter ] You need to start talking.
[time=2374] [SILENCE]
[time=2376] So you all were great, lots of chatter, no thunder.
[time=2380] Well done.
[time=2381] What'd you come up with?
[time=2382] Just give me a hand, somebody, yes.
[time=2386] Esther, wow, great, great, great, great example.
[time=2391] Esther, so much on the line for her.
[time=2395] She could have just, yeah, she could have gone the other direction, but she chooses this quiet, trusting humility, and it's so refreshing.
[time=2404] Great, great example.
[time=2406] Esther, yes.
[time=2408] Joseph, awesome.
[time=2410] Joseph, okay, hang on.
[time=2412] You mean Joseph in the Old Testament or Joseph Mary's husband?
[time=2416] Oh, absolutely, very humble.
[time=2419] Yeah, Tammy.
[time=2420] Samuel, very good example.
[time=2422] Well done.
[time=2423] Okay, hang on.
[time=2424] You guys are awesome.
[time=2425] You could just keep going, couldn't you?
[time=2426] No, seriously, good job.
[time=2428] We'll let others play right here.
[time=2430] Vern.
[time=2433] What's that?
[time=2435] Yes, our Lord.
[time=2438] Absolutely.
[time=2439] Others of you, who'd you come up with?
[time=2441] In the back, yes.
[time=2443] Abigail.
[time=2444] Very good.
[time=2445] Not many of you were thinking about Abigail.
[time=2448] I wasn't either, but it's actually a very good example right here.
[time=2453] Yes, Daniel.
[time=2455] Absolutely.
[time=2456] Enormous success, incredible power, humble heart.
[time=2460] Yes, over here.
[time=2462] Moses.
[time=2463] Uncle Mitch, help you with that?
[time=2467] Yeah, that's a great example, my friend's Moses.
[time=2470] Didn't really want the position.
[time=2473] It wasn't really gifted in a sense, you know, by human standards for the position.
[time=2478] Fought God on it, you know, a number of times, but in the end, said, okay, I'll do what you want me to do.
[time=2484] I want to come back to thanks for the hands.
[time=2486] Let me just give you it.
[time=2487] Let me give you one here that just blew me away when I kind of came back to it this week.
[time=2492] And that's Joseph in the Old Testament.
[time=2495] And most of you know the story.
[time=2497] Others of you may not.
[time=2498] It is an incredible read.
[time=2501] It is an amazing, I read it again this week.
[time=2505] If you, you know, I was almost going to say if you have some time, I know you have time.
[time=2509] You should go back to Genesis, mid-30s, 38, 37.
[time=2516] Go back to Genesis 38, 37, 38, 39.
[time=2520] If I just read, you know, read three or four chapters there and you will grab hold of one of the most amazing stories you've ever read.
[time=2528] And it is the story of Joseph.
[time=2529] And I want to just give you a snippet from the Joseph story that I think is just amazing.
[time=2537] As far as just an example and an illustration of somebody who through their humble obedience
[time=2544] brought great glory and honor to God and evidence is for us and models for us.
[time=2549] It's a huge commitment and unwavering faithfulness to a cause.
[time=2554] And in this case, the cause was this young man's commitment to honor God.
[time=2559] Go to 39.
[time=2560] Go to Genesis 39.
[time=2562] We're going to pick it up in verse four.
[time=2565] Joseph, again, just to refresh your memory.
[time=2568] Joseph has, his brothers hated him, remember?
[time=2573] Jacob the dad, Joseph and his brothers, and the brothers hated him and they throw him in this pit and they tell their dad he got killed by a lion.
[time=2582] And really, they didn't get killed.
[time=2583] He got sold.
[time=2584] His brothers sell him into slavery.
[time=2587] Big caravan.
[time=2588] A camel takes him to Egypt.
[time=2590] Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[time=2593] This young kid just absolutely got hosed by his brothers.
[time=2597] He had every reason in the world to be bitter and angry.
[time=2601] But he was a young man who much had been invested in.
[time=2604] You can tell that.
[time=2605] He has character.
[time=2606] So he goes.
[time=2608] And they take him to Egypt and a guy named Potiphar who was way, way high up in the Egyptian government.
[time=2615] Potiphar buys Joseph and brings Joseph back to his plantation, back to his estate, back to his place.
[time=2623] It was just huge.
[time=2624] And it says in verse four.
[time=2626] So Joseph found favor in his sight, in Potiphar's sight and became his personal servant.
[time=2634] And Potiphar made Joseph overseer of his house.
[time=2638] And all that he owned, he put in his charge.
[time=2642] Everything Potiphar owned.
[time=2644] Everything gets put under Joseph's charge.
[time=2648] Now it came about that from the time he made him overseer of his house, and over all that he owned,
[time=2654] the Lord blessed the Egyptians house on account of Joseph.
[time=2659] Thus the Lord's blessing was upon all that he owned in the house and in the field.
[time=2666] So he, Potiphar, left everything he owned in Joseph's charge.
[time=2672] And with him there, he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate.
[time=2680] Now come on, just for a moment, put yourself in the sandals of a seventeen-year-old kid
[time=2687] who's been hosed by his brothers, taken hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles away,
[time=2693] now in a foreign land with foreign people, all of a sudden he exercises a bit of faithfulness
[time=2699] and then boom, the blessing comes.
[time=2702] Enormous blessing.
[time=2704] I mean you really can't here appreciate what it means when it says that Potiphar put this young man in charge of everything he owned.
[time=2713] It was as if, I mean in that day, if you were looking at that situation, it would be as if he was just this,
[time=2719] it was like a superstar.
[time=2721] It was like all of a sudden here's this golden child who everything he touches goes well and Potiphar just gives him authority and oversight, capacity with everything.
[time=2732] And you can just imagine what that must have been like, what that must have felt like.
[time=2738] Now Joseph, how would your seventeen-year-old handle that?
[time=2746] How would you handle that?
[time=2748] You're now the man.
[time=2750] You are now it at this enormous estate with everything you want at your fingertips,
[time=2758] and everybody and everything answering to you.
[time=2763] Now Joseph was handsome, informed, and appearance.
[time=2768] It's a good looking kid.
[time=2770] It came about after these events that his master's wife looked with desire at Joseph,
[time=2776] and she said lie with me, not as in telefib, but as in come and sleep with me.
[time=2784] She's seducing him.
[time=2789] It came about after these events, his master's wife looked with them and said, but he refused, verse eight, but he refused.
[time=2796] Seventeen.
[time=2797] And he refused and said to his master's wife, behold.
[time=2802] With me here, my master doesn't, I see if you can pick up some humility here.
[time=2806] Behold with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house, and he has put all that he owns in my charge.
[time=2815] There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife.
[time=2825] How then could I do this great evil and sin against Potiphar?
[time=2831] No.
[time=2832] Look at the maturity there.
[time=2834] Look at the mindset.
[time=2836] This is who it's all about with Joseph.
[time=2840] He is not going to offend God.
[time=2846] As she spoke to Joseph, here watch this.
[time=2848] So you think, wow, you think, yeah, the young guy, she stepped up.
[time=2853] He delivered the goods.
[time=2854] I mean, he said it like it is.
[time=2856] He put it out there.
[time=2857] Now take that lady and get out of my sight.
[time=2860] Next verse, as she spoke to Joseph day after day.
[time=2868] And that's how it oftentimes is.
[time=2870] That's how it oftentimes is with, you know, with seduction, whatever kind of seduction.
[time=2875] Whoever it is, whatever they are trying to seduce you to do, whatever is going on there,
[time=2882] the enemy knows that when that is day after day, after day, chip away, chip away, chip
[time=2890] away day after day, moment by moment.
[time=2896] So she just goes after, day after day.
[time=2902] He did not listen to her to lie beside her or even be with her.
[time=2909] Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work.
[time=2913] And none of the men of the household was there inside.
[time=2916] She caught him, caught.
[time=2919] She was literally going after him.
[time=2923] He's a boy.
[time=2925] She catches him by his garment, grabs him by his cloak, saying lie with me.
[time=2931] And he left and he turns and runs.
[time=2933] He left his garment in her hand and fled and went outside.
[time=2939] The obedience that accompanies humility.
[time=2944] Pride and arrogance would have been in bed with that woman in a heartbeat.
[time=2950] Because look who he had become.
[time=2954] But he's humble.
[time=2956] And he wants to honor God and he wants to have commitment and unwavering faithful devotion
[time=2962] to that cause.
[time=2964] So she calls to the men of her household instead of them.
[time=2969] See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us talking about pot of fur.
[time=2974] He came into me talking about Joseph to lie with me.
[time=2977] And I screamed.
[time=2979] She screamed.
[time=2981] And the guys come and they get Joseph and they bring the charges against him.
[time=2985] And Potiphar believes his wife.
[time=2987] And Joseph goes to prison.
[time=2989] And if you're sitting here and you've never heard the story and you're going, you've got to be kidding me.
[time=2994] No, it's amazing.
[time=2995] Go home.
[time=2996] Pick up your Bible and read.
[time=2998] It is incredible what God does with this young man and what this young man and his commitment.
[time=3006] What God does with that to affect an entire nation.
[time=3012] Plus for more stuff, it keeps you and I from commitment.
[time=3016] Pride and the disobedience that so oftentimes accompanies it.
[time=3020] And the last week we looked at a third thing.
[time=3022] Fear.
[time=3024] Fear keeps you and I from commitment to God.
[time=3027] Fear.
[time=3028] Derails us in our attempt to be fully devoted to him.
[time=3034] What will they say?
[time=3035] What will they think?
[time=3037] What will I look like?
[time=3039] What's going to happen to me?
[time=3043] Am I going to lose my life?
[time=3044] Am I going to lose my reputation?
[time=3045] Am I going to let me?
[time=3046] We just all of a sudden there comes the questions and we begin to wonder while trust and faith go out the window.
[time=3054] And this all becomes very human.
[time=3056] And fleshly we just grab hold of this situation and our fear absolutely moves us away from this place of devotion and trust.
[time=3068] We talked about Peter last week.
[time=3070] That was our example on the negative side.
[time=3073] Peter of all guys.
[time=3076] Of all people, Peter should have known as he stood by that fire warming himself with the slave girl.
[time=3083] Peter of all people should have known.
[time=3086] Of the miraculous power and strength and provision of our Lord, Peter should have stood there with his shoulders back and his head up and said,
[time=3095] "You're right. I do know him." Peter just says, "No. Don't know him. Not part of that. Fear grips him. He's done."
[time=3106] So I'm thinking about, and I'll just ask you, we won't take as much time.
[time=3111] Who's the opposite in here?
[time=3115] Who was courageous in the face of stuff that would just have normally just scared anybody?
[time=3126] I mean, just think about somebody who in the face of that which would have possibly moved even the strongest of person toward a lack of faith and a lack of trust and a departure from commitment.
[time=3138] Who was it that just stood up and said, "You know what? I'm not going to be gripped by fear. I am going to do what's right.
[time=3152] Your minds are probably gone. I don't want to take more time. Let me just take you to Daniel chapter three and give you one of the greatest examples of this."
[time=3160] And it's such a -- I'm not ripping on Peter. Peter's a good guy. Peter's a great guy. Sorry.
[time=3169] This is not a slam on Peter. It's just amazing that a man -- I want to show you a few boys. These were boys.
[time=3177] These were 14-year-old boys who had been taken 1500 miles away from their home by a crazed and maniacal king named Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=3191] These are Jewish boys and their names are Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. This Nebuchadnezzar, this would be like -- wow, I'm trying to think of a modern-day example of this.
[time=3205] This might be like the guy over in Iran. This might be like our buddy over in Iran right now.
[time=3212] Okay, so you just take -- you take your 14-year-old boy. I'll take mine. You just take some 14 15-year-old boys right now and you ship them off to Iran and you put them in a dungeon and you have this guy come walking down the steps.
[time=3227] And he says this. And what this guy, Nebuchadnezzar says is finally he's so full of himself. He wants everybody in the land to worship him.
[time=3235] So he builds this 70, 90-foot-tall golden image of himself and he says whenever you hear the music bow down and worship me, well these boys have been invested in.
[time=3244] These boys had been taught. Somebody had made a spiritual deposit into their hearts and their souls and they know better.
[time=3252] They know that because this is about who? This is about God. This isn't about their comfort. This isn't about their safety.
[time=3258] This isn't about anything other than their commitment to Yahweh. They know they can't bow down and worship another God.
[time=3266] They learn that. They learn that way, way, way, way back at age three, you know? And here they are 14, 15. So he says bow down. They say no.
[time=3274] He says, "Well, I'm going to kill you. I'm going to burn you alive. I'm going to throw you in a furnace and you're going to be burned to death if you don't do what I say."
[time=3284] So then it just comes to this. Daniel 3, 16, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar."
[time=3292] I wish I could have seen their faces as they say that, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer concerning this matter.
[time=3303] If it be so, our God whom we serve, our God whom we are committed to and have been from day one and will still be tomorrow, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire.
[time=3321] And he will deliver us out of your hand, O King. One way or the other, burn to a crisp or delivered by God. He's going to deliver us from you."
[time=3335] Commitment. But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O King, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.
[time=3350] You're not going to do it. And you know what? You think about it. I mean, really, the whole worshiping other idols thing.
[time=3359] That was a law that those boys had learned that had to do with the heart of a person and the direction of their allegiance.
[time=3368] Surely, they could have just kneeled down. They could have taken some physical posture but not really meant it, right?
[time=3377] And this is the amazing thing about these 14-year-old boys. Even at this age, this now has become, for them, a matter of principle.
[time=3385] They're not going to even look. They're not going to even appear evil. They're not going to even give the notion of disobedience.
[time=3396] Well, they will not bow down. Period. Kill us. Either way, we'll be all right. No fear. Great trust. Enormous faith.
[time=3407] And I just want to give that to you this morning, just those pictures. And I want you to think through and invite you to honestly think through where you are today.
[time=3425] And not with relationship to a project, but in relationship to him. Because I want you. I pray for you and my soul longs for you and for us as a family to be unwavering and faithful in our devotion to a cause.
[time=3443] And the cause is honoring and obeying and following him. And these barriers are real and they are every day. And I would long for you and I to be people freed from those things and able to live with a contentment in our lives as it relates to stuff,
[time=3462] a humble obedience in our lives that moves away from pride, a courage to follow that moves away from the destruction and the distraction of fear.
[time=3475] And I know that if you'll commit yourself to that, I know he is a faithful God who will commit himself to you as well.
[time=3492] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
