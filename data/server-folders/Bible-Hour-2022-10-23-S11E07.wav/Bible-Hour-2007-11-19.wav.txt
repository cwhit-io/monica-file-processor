[time=528] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I want to welcome you again to the Bible Hour. We're back into our study of first John, here on the broadcast, and this morning what you're going to see is Steve Longbreak
[time=541] and myself, Steve's one of our teaching pastors, and we come to a section here in chapter two of first John that really gives us a chance to explain to you in a, I hope, clear
[time=552] way, kind of what John's been doing all along. We haven't talked much about it, but I want you to be prepared for it. It is a chance for you to take a test. It really is an opportunity
[time=563] for you to do an assessment of your faith, and I hope you realize how important that is.
[time=570] I don't know what you do for a living. I'm not sure what you give your days or nights to. I'll tell you what though, in my, in my days and nights as a pastor, in my profession, it's always good
[time=581] to stop periodically and to ask others and to assess even from within how you're doing,
[time=588] how well am I accomplishing my tasks, how effective am I being at what God's called me to,
[time=594] testing ourselves, assessing ourselves is always a good thing. The scriptures oftentimes ask you and
[time=602] I to, as believers, assess ourselves and to determine whether or not we're complying with and living
[time=610] up to and living consistently with that which God has called us to. In the book of first John,
[time=616] what you'll see really is a series of tests and the test, the test is so that we can assess the
[time=623] genuineness of our faith. That's right. This is an opportunity for you and I to just honestly and
[time=631] sincerely and with great authenticity look inward and allow the reality of our lives,
[time=638] the reality, the truth about our lives to be kind of matched up against the truth of God's
[time=645] word because God's word is very clear and it's probably nowhere any clearer than it is in first John that this is what a believer's life will look like. This is what a true follower of Christ
[time=656] will, will be like. This will be the pattern of their life and so he says, now you and I are to
[time=662] assess, to test ourselves. And so as you watch this morning and as we move into some of the
[time=668] doctrinal and moral tests that first John gives us, I want to just encourage you to have the courage
[time=675] and to have the guts and the honesty before God to say really, how am I doing? What is the condition
[time=681] of my faith? Are there things I need to give thought to? Are there things I can just rejoice
[time=688] over and be so very thankful for? I want to ask you this morning to give some real consideration to the genuineness of your faith and don't let me be the judge and don't let anyone else be the
[time=699] judge. Let the word of God be the judge and I hope as you look and as you think that through,
[time=705] I hope you'll be encouraged. Thank you for tuning in. If there's anything we can do to help, if any of this study raises any questions in your heart and mind, please shoot us an email,
[time=717] give us a phone call. We would love nothing more than to come alongside you as you consider
[time=723] the strength and as you consider the reality and as you consider the struggles that you and I face at times in our walk with the Lord. Thanks for your partnership and your friendship.
[time=734] God bless you and have a great week and we hope to see you soon.
[time=753] [MUSIC - 334 seconds]
[time=1117] Well hey, if you brought your Bibles, would you open them up to 1 John chapter 2?
[time=1125] 1 John, back toward the back of your New Testament 1 John chapter 2 this morning, we're going to get there.
[time=1132] We're going to get to chapter 2 verses 3 to 6, but Steve and I are going to start the morning off by giving you a little bit of a backdrop on what we've already seen.
[time=1142] And I know as I say that, that we did that last week, but I'm going to give you a different backdrop this morning than the backdrop I gave you last week.
[time=1152] We've been kind of away from 1 John for a while, now we're back in it. I wanted to kind of catch you up last week on where we've been.
[time=1159] This week, as Steve and I have been looking at this though, I was clearly reminded as I look through this, the passages and the verses that we've already studied.
[time=1170] I was clearly reminded of something that I haven't told you about. I knew it was there all along, I just didn't feel like it was the time to kind of bring it out.
[time=1179] But as we got to this passage this morning, I really felt like it was a good time to kind of show you something that John's been doing in this book from the very beginning, chapter 1 verse 1.
[time=1190] While he's been communicating great truth, he has also been doing something very, very important that I think this morning I want to kind of fill you in on and get you caught up with.
[time=1201] And what he's been doing is he has been providing the reader, the church there at Ephesus and you and me and everyone else who would study 1 John.
[time=1212] He has really been, while communicating great truth and reminding the people of fundamental principles of the faith, he has been providing them in doing so, tests, assessment opportunities, tests of genuine salvation.
[time=1231] And I want you to write that down. Tests, I don't know how you are at taking tests, I don't know what comes to your mind, really what I want you to sense, and what I want to come to your mind as you hear me say this today is this is this book really, and we're going to show you several others.
[time=1248] Tests of genuine salvation, this provides the reader an opportunity to do an assessment of the condition and the state of their faith.
[time=1259] Now let me explain this to you, here's what's going on and this is a little bit of review, remember the Gnostic thing, remember the heresy that had infiltrated the church, what had started as a very sound church, a very sound people, they had come to faith
[time=1277] and the gospel that they had embraced and the truth that they had given their lives to was absolutely pure, it was a good thing.
[time=1285] What happened was that as the Gnostic and other false teachings began to make their way into the church, now watch this, not only did that affect the original crew, not only did it start to take away from what had been established, but now there were new people
[time=1304] who had come to the faith, you with me, and the faith that they had come to wasn't the original pure one, the faith that they had come to, that which they had embraced was this over here, this diminished, depleted faith that Gnosticism and other heresies had whittled away at, are you with me?
[time=1329] So John's concerned, so now John isn't only correcting where I, where we've gone in our study so far, has basically been, I've told you that he's been correcting the heresy, he has been.
[time=1342] What he's also been doing though is in the writing, providing a number of different tests, a number of different ways in which the reader could look at what was written and genuinely, if they were willing, and honestly before God say to themselves, I wonder, I wonder if this faith of mind that I claim to have is real.
[time=1370] Sometimes they'll hand a $20 bill to somebody at a store, maybe it's a $50, maybe it's a $100, oftentimes then, I don't know if it's a matter of the amount, maybe it's a $5.
[time=1381] I don't know if it's a amount, sometimes they just take my money and oftentimes they'll snap it, you know, kind of snap it, and they'll hold it up to the what?
[time=1392] Say it louder, the light, and they look at it in the light to see if it's what?
[time=1398] Say it louder, real or what?
[time=1402] Fake.
[time=1405] And there were in that day a lot of fake people who said they were in, but what they had said they were in for, what they had professed was a really depleted picture of what was true.
[time=1421] And so all through this first part of the book of 1 John, you get these tests, just write this down.
[time=1429] We're going to go through this quick and then get to our passage this morning, but I want you to, I want you to kind of go back and I want you to catch what he's done.
[time=1435] Two, two original, and go back to chapter one, verse one, and we're going to see here in chapter one, two doctrinal tests.
[time=1444] Just write that down, two doctrinal tests, the first of which is John thinks it's very important, especially in light of where Gnosticism has gone in depleting people's view of Christ.
[time=1458] John says, no, wait a minute, to be a believer, to be a genuine Christ follower, test number one, you have to have a proper view of Christ.
[time=1469] Write that down, a proper view of Christ. The Gnostics were infatuated with the ethereal, the Gnostics were infatuated with the hyper-spiritual, and they had gotten to this point where they diminished.
[time=1484] They literally said it was bad, this physicalness, this humanity that some were wanting to hang on to, the physicalness and humanity of Christ.
[time=1495] They said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They were diminishing the view of Christ, and so John says, verse one, what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands.
[time=1508] Remember that concerning the word of life and the life was manifested, made real, made flesh, and we have seen and testified and proclaimed to you the eternal life.
[time=1519] That whole first section, one, one to four, is a test for anyone to take who claims to know the Lord, and test number one is, do I have a proper view of Christ?
[time=1531] That while He is deity, yes, fully God. He is also the Scriptures teach fully and absolutely human physicalness, tangible, touchable.
[time=1548] And as we say that, I want to just make sure you're tracking with me. Steve, I'll ask you why would it be so important for these people, and why would it be so important for us
[time=1559] to, if we profess to know the Lord, why would it be so important that we have an appropriate view of His physicalness?
[time=1568] Yeah, when you leave the realities of what it means to be obedient physically, and you go to a spiritual existence, like the Gnostics did, it allows you to take the doctrine of grace, warp that so that it becomes licentiousness.
[time=1587] I'm free, not free in Christ, free outside of Him, free outside of the realities of the physical reality of Him. And John 1, and John 1, 1, you know, the same gospel writer that wrote first John.
[time=1603] John says, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And then John 14 of that chapter, he says, and the Word became flesh and dwell among us. And in that same chapter, in John 1, John describes the event when Christ went to the Jordan and approached John the Baptist for baptism.
[time=1623] And remember, the voice from heaven came down, and they heard the Father say, "Behold, this is my Son, in Him I'm well pleased."
[time=1636] So for 30 years, Jesus had been living a life that pleased the Father. And I contend that if He could please Him, it meant He could displease Him. He could have, in His physical 100% man person, been disobedient and sinned.
[time=1657] And then again, in the Garden of Gethsemane, John writes again in chapter 17, "Jesus, finishing the three years of ministry that He had, on His knees, He's begging God to help Him here. He says, I don't want to do this, but He says this, He says, "Father, I have glorified the on the earth, having finished the work, thou gave us me to do. I want you to note something here."
[time=1683] That's before the cross. Jesus said, "I've finished past tense what you brought me here to do, because He remained obedient and pure, and without sin, all the way to that point, and believe Me as a man that was really hard to do, but He did it."
[time=1704] And that's important for us to know. Extremely important. And extremely connected to the very foundation of what you and I have committed to, if you've committed to know Him and love Him and follow Him.
[time=1717] The physicalness, we serve a Lord who wasn't just ethereal. We serve a Lord and we've committed our entire lives and our entire beings to one whose understanding of our lives is not distant or detached.
[time=1735] He was physical like you and I are physical, yet without sin. Look at Hebrews 4 real quick. Hebrews 4, you can just look on the screens or you could turn there. Hebrews 4, 14, I love this passage.
[time=1748] Therefore, since we have a great high priest, Jesus, who has passed through the heavens, true, he was there and did reside with God. Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
[time=1761] For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our what? Our weakness, our physicalness, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are.
[time=1778] I don't know when the last time it was, you read that line right there, but I would just call your attention back to that thought again.
[time=1786] I don't know all that you're tempted with, but I know all that I'm tempted with.
[time=1794] And to just be reminded this morning that he was tempted in every single thing that you're tempted with, knew it, saw it, encountered it, and yet was without sin.
[time=1811] Therefore, let us, verse 16, therefore, let us draw near with confidence. That's what brings great confidence, was that he was physical and tangible, and he did live in this life that we live in, yet without sin.
[time=1825] So draw near with confidence to the throne of grace so that we may receive mercy from one who understands and find grace from one who can sympathize to help in time of need, a proper view of Christ.
[time=1840] Test number one, and an opportunity for you to take stock and for you to assess the condition of your faith.
[time=1848] Number two, proper view of sin. We went through this Mitchell and I went through this a few weeks ago.
[time=1854] Back to 1 John, chapter 1, verses 5 to 10. This is the message we have heard from him and announced to you that God is light, and in him there is no sin.
[time=1864] There is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him and yet walk in sin, characterized by sin, walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
[time=1881] Here we talked about, Mitchell and I did, our view of sin, God's view of sin, and how the genuine, true, authentic follower of Christ must view that.
[time=1893] Again, the Gnostics were taking this thing to an extreme, and there was sinful stuff going on that they had just relabeled, and we'll talk about that in a moment.
[time=1903] But I want to just ask you this this morning as you think about this with me. You can write this down, you can give this some thought, this is test number two under doctrinal tests.
[time=1913] So if you're testing yourself on a proper view of sin, ask yourself this this morning, does sin, let's go general first, does sin in general, does sin in general break your heart?
[time=1926] When you see it, when you watch it play out, when you see its effect every day, in the hearts and lives and homes and friends and families and culture, when you see it, does it break your heart, are you generally?
[time=1944] Now, personally, are you saddened and remorseful over your own sin? Does your own sin, each of those sinful deeds, each of those sinful thoughts, those sinful actions, those sinful attitudes, is there a time?
[time=1961] You can hear me now, I understand this because I've sinned, sometimes it's an hour later, sometimes it's a day later, and sometimes it's a week later, but hopefully somewhere, somewhere in that time frame, the Spirit of God, if the Spirit of God truly resides, and if your heart's truly open, there is a sense of remorse and sadness over your sin.
[time=1988] Does your sin stop you in your tracks, or is it really not that big of a deal?
[time=1995] What's your view of sin?
[time=1999] Here's some application for you, we talked about this last week, having things to take with you.
[time=2004] I would encourage you, and if you want to apply this, if you want to give some thought to this, really, before God wanting to work on your attitude and your view of sin, go to Psalm 51.
[time=2017] Just write that down right now, write down Psalm 51, and I want to encourage you this week to read through Psalm 51.
[time=2027] And if you'd be willing on your own, or with a friend, or those in your small group, to read through Psalm 51, you would get a really, really, I think, healthy view, a healthy picture of one who saw sin in a pretty healthy way.
[time=2043] Psalm 51.3 says this, you can see it on the screen, and this is just a taste of it.
[time=2048] For I know, look what he said, this is David, do you think David knew something about sin?
[time=2053] Here's a healthy view of sin, for I know my transgression, you see that?
[time=2058] For I know my transgression, so many times you and I, and the view of sin that we carry with us, so many times we don't even want to think about it.
[time=2067] We don't want to name it, we don't want to put our arms around it, we don't want to be aware of it, we know it's happening, we know we're probably doing it, but so many times we get so distant from it because we don't want to get up close to it.
[time=2078] He says, I know, I know, I'm very aware of my transgressions.
[time=2084] And look what he says there, and my sin is ever before me, so many times you and I go to great lengths to take our sin and put it to the side.
[time=2094] So many times we try and tuck it back here behind us, and David says with this proper healthy view of sin, my sin is ever before me.
[time=2103] I'm not running from it, I'm not hiding from it, I'm naming it, and as you read on in that chapter, you will find one who had an enormously healthy view of sin.
[time=2114] I would encourage you, family, to do that this week, to look at Psalm 51, a proper view of Christ, a proper view of sin, you got something?
[time=2122] Yeah, I just, this is kind of risky, but I'd really like to encourage you to at least consider this.
[time=2130] It's risky because I'm kind of laying myself out there and you could really misunderstand this.
[time=2136] This morning early I was thinking about, I used to have the seniors that I taught here at the school read 1 John and I didn't teach on it.
[time=2147] I had them read it because I wanted to allow the conviction of the Holy Spirit and these words in 1 John are convicting.
[time=2152] They bring, they bring serious attention to the Lord.
[time=2157] And I was thinking today about how sometimes they would come to me and they wouldn't like it.
[time=2162] Some people would just say, I don't like that, that can't be right.
[time=2165] And others would have a broken and contrite heart.
[time=2167] And Kelly's talked about people that come to see him and when you have a broken and contrite heart about 1 John, that's evidence that you are a believer.
[time=2176] You do know him, but the people that reject it and say, I don't like it.
[time=2180] I was thinking this morning, I was driving on the way to church and I started to cry, just weeping about the reality that 1 John, for me, these last two weeks as I've been reading this,
[time=2192] 1 John has been more comforting to me now than it used to be.
[time=2198] And I was just thanking the Lord.
[time=2201] The reason it's more comforting is I don't do the same thing.
[time=2205] I've tried to eliminate some of the junk, you know, instead of repenting and then doing it again, I've tried to eliminate some.
[time=2212] So the things don't come roaring up that used to come roaring up.
[time=2216] And I was just thanking him and praising him.
[time=2219] Then at 56, it's not like I was at 36.
[time=2223] It's better.
[time=2224] And first John can be, I just want you to know, this can be a comforting passage.
[time=2229] It can bring joy to your heart.
[time=2231] Why?
[time=2232] Because of verse two in chapter two.
[time=2234] He's the propitiation for my sin.
[time=2237] And then in him, I don't have to sin as I yield to him.
[time=2244] And so these words are not so indicting.
[time=2247] Now I still have all kinds of sins of omission that roar up, but it's not the same stuff.
[time=2253] And I just want to encourage you.
[time=2256] It feels better.
[time=2259] Rejecting disobedience and taking on obedience.
[time=2265] I love my relationship with him.
[time=2268] And I just wept thinking this brought joy to my heart the last two weeks.
[time=2280] Anybody in the room ever just cry out to God?
[time=2285] God, I wish I could stop struggling with this.
[time=2289] Yeah.
[time=2290] Anybody?
[time=2291] Yeah.
[time=2292] Those are huge words of encouragement, my friends.
[time=2298] And Steve would be the first to tell you, you know, he's not perfect.
[time=2301] But I hope you got the spirit of what he just said is that in faithfulness, in walking with
[time=2308] him, in staying at it, in surrounding yourself with others, in giving yourself to this completely.
[time=2316] In community with others, submitting yourself to Godly leaders, opening your heart to sound
[time=2323] teaching.
[time=2324] At 56, it's better.
[time=2331] And I want to just encourage you at 26, at 16, you know, at 44.
[time=2340] Those are encouraging words because I like you get weary at times.
[time=2347] And I can't wait for the day for first John not to be as discouraging as it can be.
[time=2357] And I'm really grateful.
[time=2359] Thank you for sharing that.
[time=2363] Two doctrinal tests for you to take.
[time=2367] Do you have a proper view of Christ and do you have a proper view of sin?
[time=2371] And now he comes to chapter two, verses three to six, where we are today.
[time=2375] And I want to just kind of say it to you differently here.
[time=2377] While it is great truth that addresses the drift, it also provides a test for salvation.
[time=2384] And the test here isn't so much a doctrinal test, but you can write it down.
[time=2388] It's a moral test.
[time=2389] We'll now see in the text two moral tests, the first one being the test of obedience.
[time=2396] The test of obedience, a very important one.
[time=2399] And I'm going to have Steve just read that.
[time=2402] And if you all would in honor of God's word, just stand and Steve will read that for us.
[time=2410] First John chapter two, verses three through six.
[time=2413] And by this we know that we have come to know him if we keep his commandments.
[time=2421] The one who says I have come to know him and does not keep his commandments is a liar
[time=2427] and the truth is not in him.
[time=2429] But whoever keeps his word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected.
[time=2434] By this we know that we are in him.
[time=2437] The one who says he abides in him, ought himself to walk in the same manner as he walked.
[time=2446] Father in heaven, we bow our heads in our hearts and we sing songs of praise because
[time=2455] we even have the potential to do what those verses say in Christ.
[time=2462] We can't do any of that on our own.
[time=2467] But in you, Lord Jesus, we have the power to walk as you walked.
[time=2475] And I pray that you'd help us learn that from this passage of Scripture.
[time=2479] In Jesus' name I pray, amen, you may be seated.
[time=2484] Quick introduction, at work, we talk a lot at work about character.
[time=2491] We talk about attitude and integrity, and this passage lines up there.
[time=2498] So when it comes to our character, both our attitude and our integrity, our attitude means
[time=2507] I have a humble, broken, contrite spirit, a submissive spirit.
[time=2513] And I'm submitting to a belief system that is right.
[time=2519] So let me preface it, we're talking about a submissive spirit to a belief system that's right that we have in common here.
[time=2526] We have beliefs that are based on what the Word says we should be believing.
[time=2529] So I have an attitude that's submissive.
[time=2531] I'm teachable.
[time=2536] And if I have a teachable heart and I'm a man of integrity, that means I actually flesh
[time=2543] out and live out what I say, I believe, then my character is revealed and you can trust
[time=2551] me.
[time=2553] And so this passage of Scripture that we're looking at tells us how we can have a character that's trustworthy.
[time=2561] Character of obedience.
[time=2562] Yes.
[time=2563] Absolutely.
[time=2564] And you see it, it starts there in verse three.
[time=2568] It says by this, you can just follow along with us.
[time=2570] We're just going to take you through these verses and just try and share with you some things that we've found on this test of obedience.
[time=2578] And again, it's the opportunity for everybody in this room in a very healthy way, say, in
[time=2585] your own spirit before God, God, I want to make sure, God, I want to have confidence
[time=2593] that who I am and the way I'm conducting myself and the spirit within me, I want to make sure that I'm yours.
[time=2599] I want to make sure that I'm yours and one of the ways that you're able to do that is
[time=2605] by assessing the state of your obedient character, the test of obedience.
[time=2611] By this, look at verse three, by this we know that we have come to know Him.
[time=2618] By this, look at that.
[time=2619] By this we know, we want to point this out to you, we thought this was pretty amazing.
[time=2623] By this we know that we have come to know Him, the word know in the Greek.
[time=2631] The word know in the Greek is used in this book, five chapters in 1 John.
[time=2636] The word know in the Greek which is gnosis, sound familiar?
[time=2644] The word for know to know in the Greek is the word gnosis.
[time=2650] And it's where they got this idea of gnosticism because they were infatuated with knowing
[time=2658] and they had taken their infatuation with knowing and they had gone to the complete other end of the spectrum.
[time=2665] And so I just think it's almost comical.
[time=2667] I think it's great the way He does it.
[time=2669] John now in the book of 1 John uses the Greek word gnosis 40 times.
[time=2676] He uses the word nostic when they read it then they would have just been reading gnosis.
[time=2684] I mean, that's what they would have been hearing.
[time=2686] It's as if He's saying, look, you want to know, you want to nostic, nostic this.
[time=2696] Don't be consumed and don't be infatuated with nosticking that because that's not gnosis.
[time=2704] No, no.
[time=2705] Not knowing.
[time=2706] This is knowing.
[time=2707] No.
[time=2708] And you read through 1 John, many of you are doing that.
[time=2710] You read through 1 John, you see it again and again and again.
[time=2713] I want you to know, I want you to know, I want you to know, I want you to know, I want you to have understanding of what's true and genuine and real.
[time=2723] And it's not, it's not gnostic, it's gnosis.
[time=2728] He says by this we know that we have come to know Him if we keep His commandments.
[time=2737] The keyboard's good.
[time=2738] It has to do with guarding the commandments.
[time=2742] It has to do with making sure you guard them in your heart and you know them and you keep them.
[time=2747] And it taught his and him when those pronouns are used there.
[time=2749] I love this.
[time=2750] John uses those pronouns to talk about the Trinity.
[time=2754] He's not referring to Jesus or the Father there.
[time=2756] He's always both and he doesn't distinguish them, one from another.
[time=2762] And the commandments, he says, I want you to know, you know you know Him if you keep you guard His commandments.
[time=2769] And I love this, a couple of the commentaries that I looked at referred back to John chapter
[time=2775] 13 when Jesus described for them the commandments.
[time=2779] He says I give you a new commandment.
[time=2780] This is Jesus commandments.
[time=2782] Love one another.
[time=2784] Okay, we're not talking about the Mosaic Law here.
[time=2787] We're talking about the fulfillment of the Mosaic Law in Christ.
[time=2791] The great commandment.
[time=2793] Love the Lord your God and love one another.
[time=2796] Love each other.
[time=2798] So here he says, I'm hanging it on this, you'll know you know Him if you guard the fact that
[time=2805] you're keeping, you're guarding His commandment to love Him and to love each other.
[time=2811] Yeah.
[time=2813] And that's a whole lot easier to guard than some of the lists that they made up.
[time=2818] Yeah.
[time=2819] You understand?
[time=2820] Guard it.
[time=2821] Keep it, not just do it, but guard it.
[time=2823] You keep, you know you've come to know Him if you're really, really clear and you'll hold tightly to that great command of loving God with all your heart and loving others as
[time=2835] yourself.
[time=2836] It's interesting just again to give you some backdrop and I want to just, you know, you read this.
[time=2841] We know we've come to know Him if we keep His commandments.
[time=2844] The one who says, look at verse four, the one who says, I have come to know Him.
[time=2849] Remember this group that I described over here?
[time=2851] Maybe the more recent convert who had come to a faith that had now by this time been twisted.
[time=2858] So you got somebody over here going, Oh, I know Him.
[time=2862] And he says, he says, the one who says, I've come to know Him and does not keep His commandments is a liar and the truth, the sad, tragic truth is, the truth is not in Him.
[time=2874] As I was reading again this week, I read account after account after account of how the gnostics with their preoccupation with the ethereal and hyper-spiritual had completely moved away
[time=2885] from the physical to the point where what you did with your physical body, they thought
[time=2892] the physical body was not only bad, they had gotten to the point now where it was of no consequence, so do whatever you want to do, they said with your physical body, your physical
[time=2904] body and someone else's physical body, have at it reckless, free, just it doesn't matter
[time=2913] they were saying and John's going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, time out.
[time=2921] That doctrine's not this doctrine and then the pure gospel that we embraced and in the
[time=2929] word of truth, God has spoken clearly about that which we should give ourselves to and
[time=2936] that which we should not in the physical realm.
[time=2940] He says, if you say, I've come to know Him and do not keep His commandment, you're a liar and the truth is not in Him.
[time=2947] Steve had a great illustration of this.
[time=2949] A liar is a person that has a repeated pattern, they say they know Him but they have a pattern
[time=2956] of life that doesn't reflect Him, they say they know Him but they have a posture that doesn't reflect humility and I was thinking about, okay, what would a liar look like?
[time=2968] Well, I thought about this, a person who says they know something but then their actions don't really line up with that, I was thinking about referees and I thought about referees they have striped shirts and they have a whistle and sometimes they even have a patch, sometimes they don't but they take a test to say they, and it'd be like a referee who says, I know the rules of the game and I know the game, basketball, yeah, this would be basketball first and it wouldn't matter and then they'll get it in a minute, then he comes to the game
[time=3000] and he starts refereeing the game and he runs down the court and he says foul on number 52 and he gives a traveling signal like this, foul on number 52, Mitchell Cruz.
[time=3013] And then or an umpire behind the plate that there'd be a close play at the plate and the
[time=3020] guy gets tagged and he goes, you're out!
[time=3024] And we'd all know, I mean everybody knows that's not out, the action doesn't align with what he says he knows and sometimes as a believer I can say I know things but my actions don't
[time=3039] align with what I say I know and who I say I know.
[time=3047] The false teachers, they get exposed in this, false faith, you know it gets exposed in this,
[time=3057] the false teachers ongoing pattern of failure, failure to obey God's commands demonstrates
[time=3065] their lack of genuine faith, their lack of genuine faith but whoever, look at verse 5,
[time=3073] but whoever keeps his word, now just a quick regression to last week, keeps his word one
[time=3083] time we're not talking about once, remember we're talking about a pattern, if the pattern
[time=3090] of one's life, I read somewhere this week about, they just somebody said it differently
[time=3096] and it just kind of stuck out, a habit, do you have, I got some bad, who's got some bad habits in the room, anybody, I got some bad habits, I keep, I've been biting my nails
[time=3107] since I was four years old and I still bite my nails, any nail biters in the room, thank
[time=3115] you, a habit you know and in that case it's a bad habit, now do I bite my nails all the
[time=3122] time, no I'm characterized as a nail biter, we're talking about in first John patterns
[time=3131] what you're characterized by and if you're characterized by saying hey I know him and the pattern of your life is sin and the pattern of your heart is you don't really care, we
[time=3145] got a problem, if the pattern of your life, back to verse 5, if the pattern but whoever
[time=3151] keeps his word as a pattern, you're a habit, you have a habit of obeying, how's that sound?
[time=3160] Where keeps his word and him the love of God has truly been perfected, by this we know
[time=3167] gnosis, by this we know that we are in him and then I love verse 6, read that Steve, there's
[time=3174] some great words there.
[time=3175] Yeah verse 6 says, the one who says he abides in him, ought himself to walk in the same manner
[time=3182] as he has walked, abide, means to be held, to be kept and it is something that's continual,
[time=3192] it is a continual pattern in my life that I realize I'm abiding in him that way I'm able
[time=3199] to walk in him, that's awesome.
[time=3207] When you think about the scriptures and you think about this idea of our actions, our
[time=3215] obedience if you will, Steve, when you think about that and you think about the scriptures,
[time=3221] where else do we see this concept of actions not saving us but actions giving evidence,
[time=3230] obedience giving evidence of one being truly saved?
[time=3234] And we actually thought about this separately and we both went to James like that because
[time=3240] my faith, my faith is going to be revealed with my works, there's alignment there, there's
[time=3246] integrity there with what I say I believe in the way I behave.
[time=3251] In James chapter 2, when he says, "Consider it pure joy in my brethren when you face trials of many kinds," if I do consider it pure joy and you see me going through trial, and
[time=3263] I still have the joy of the Lord in that.
[time=3267] It's not that I'm happy, it's not that I'm jumping around excited but it's characterized
[time=3273] by a person who moves through it, my faith gets lived out in the action by me considering,
[time=3279] so it's mental action as well as physical action.
[time=3284] Turning your Bibles to James 2, if you would real quick, many of you have studied this passage, many of you are very familiar with what it says.
[time=3293] For others of you in the room, it may be new truth for you this morning.
[time=3296] It is just a great illustration of this very concept that John brings to us in our passage
[time=3302] this morning back in 1 John 2.
[time=3305] Here you see that very same thing, that test of obedience, a way to assess your heart and mind on this front.
[time=3312] Look what it says in verse 14, "What use is it my brethren, if someone says he has faith, someone says he has faith, but he has no works, can that faith save him, if a brother or
[time=3323] sister is without clothing, and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them,
[time=3330] go in peace, be warmed and be filled, and yet you do not give them what is necessary
[time=3336] for their body.
[time=3338] What use is that?" Somebody in the room answer.
[time=3344] What use is that, it's of no use, you've done nothing.
[time=3353] Even so, faith, verse 17, if it has no works is dead being by itself, it's an empty statement.
[time=3362] But someone may well say, "You have faith and I have works, show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works." You believe that God is one, you do well, the demons also believe and shudder.
[time=3376] But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless,
[time=3385] and then he gives this great, great, you can read through that on your own, this great illustration of Abraham and how the works didn't save him, the works gave evidence of
[time=3396] a genuine faith.
[time=3397] I wrote this down earlier today, if it's really about the heart, listen, if it's really about the heart, take compassion, take the issue of compassion that James speaks to.
[time=3409] If it's really about the heart, words of compassion or acts of compassion, which of
[time=3415] the two indicate most clearly a heart of compassion, words or acts, acts of compassion.
[time=3425] Words of loyalty, acts of loyalty, which of the two indicate most clearly a heart of loyalty.
[time=3432] Words of love, sometimes we speak those.
[time=3437] Sometimes we say that freely, "I love you, I love you." Words of love, acts of love, which of the two indicate most clearly a heart of love.
[time=3448] Our hope this morning is that you and we're going to move on here in the passage when we come back to 1 John, what we're going to come to the second moral test and that is the test of love.
[time=3459] It's an amazing, amazing look and a great opportunity for you and I to assess.
[time=3464] Our hope this morning is that you would take this opportunity, this week as you spend time
[time=3470] in 1 John, this week as you talk about these things with a trusted friend, we would want
[time=3476] nothing more for you than clarity, real clarity on where you stand with him.
