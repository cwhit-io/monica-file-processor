[time=60] Hi, my name is Kelly Bird, and I'm the senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I want to thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour.
[time=66] It's great to have you with us again.
[time=68] I want to extend to you a personal invitation to come and join us in just a couple of weeks.
[time=73] On December 14th, 15th, and 16th, it's already December, I can't believe it,
[time=79] and that means here at Black Hawk that we are about to celebrate Christmas with Black Hawk.
[time=84] CWB, as we call it, and I just can't wait for you to come and be a part of this.
[time=89] Many of you in our community have been coming for over 25, 30 years now
[time=95] to celebrate this greatest of all stories as we get the chance to, again, proclaim it through the arts.
[time=102] And I hope that you'll come. I hope you'll bring your friends.
[time=104] I hope you'll bring your family members.
[time=106] I hope that you'll invite some people that maybe you'll work with.
[time=109] And while this is a truly worshipful experience and a great opportunity for those of us that know the Savior,
[time=118] to remember his birth and to be so encouraged again by what he did, it's also a great opportunity for you and I to invite those who are still considering Christ,
[time=129] still giving thought to what it means or what it looks like to live a life that's fully surrendered to him.
[time=135] And so I want to just encourage you, invite them, bring them, allow them the opportunity to through what they're going to see and experience, maybe understand for the very first time what Christ did, who he is, how much he loves them and the life that they can have in relationship with him.
[time=154] It's December 14, 15, and 16, and I'll tell you what, I can't wait for you to see what the team has in store.
[time=162] As always, there's just going to be, there's theatrical excellence.
[time=167] There's musical brilliance and aside from those things, a message, a timeless message that is so very powerful,
[time=175] not because of those who speak it, but because of the one whom it concerns, that being our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=182] So come celebrate with us Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=185] We can't wait to have you go online at BlackhawkMinistries.org.

[time=194] You can order your tickets or you can come by the church office anytime during the week.
[time=198] We'd love to put some tickets in your hands.
[time=201] Hey, God bless you. We'll look forward to seeing you soon.

[time=204] Rose from the dead and then ascended into heaven and he sits at the right hand of our Heavenly Father,
[time=211] even now as we sing and speak.
[time=214] And Revelation 5 tells us that the elders and angels bow down before Him and they sing holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,
[time=222] the God who was, the God who is, and the God who is to come.
[time=227] And we're going to join them now with our version of their heavenly song.
[time=232] I'd invite you to stand with us as we sing.
[time=235] Hallelujah to the Lord God Almighty.
[time=477] Christ is the Lord.
[time=486] Hallelujah for the Lord God Almighty.
[time=556] You got your Bibles open first John open with me to chapter two if you will and I want to just remind you how we got where we got here in this study I want to remind you what's been going on literally in the heart and mind of the Apostle John as he picks up a pen and begins to write this letter the first of three to the church there at Ephesus.
[time=583] The church there at Ephesus John had been a part of John had seen with his own eyes and had experienced in his own life the birth of that church he had seen its great strength and its great stability and the great way that God had used that church at Ephesus and now as the years have transpired heresy and false teaching have crept in the effectiveness of that church the spiritual health of that body had started to decline.
[time=610] And so with that first century picture in mind with the church in great compromise and great trouble John writes and he writes as we've said before he writes to address the issues he writes to address the truth that desperately needed to be re clarified for these people as it related to what the truth of God really is
[time=633] what the scriptures really say what's God's heart really on the foundational components of the faith we've been asking questions like this as our study has unfolded what does it look like to truly follow Christ
[time=650] I want you to think about that again with me today I'm going to continue to invite you to think again and again and to ask that question again and again as it relates to the different arenas of your life
[time=662] what does it look like to truly follow Christ what picture does the scripture paint and we've seen it here in first John what picture does the scripture paint of normative devotion to Christ normative relationships with others who follow Christ
[time=680] a normative view of sin and the world and obedience and I use the word normative there I want you to understand why I use that word because so many times we fall into the habit of and I think so many times there is a tendency to when we look at God's word
[time=698] and when someone teaches it or when we're studying it on our own and we see the principles of God's word set out in clear view there are times there is a temptation I'll say it that way for you and I to look at that biblical bar if you will
[time=715] there are times where we hear this taught and we see this proclaimed and there's a temptation to take all of this and we kind of create this biblical bar and we kind of call it super super extraordinary we call it extraordinary we think
[time=732] it's hyper spiritual and we think it's just this thing that we can never do and only the really really really godly people do what this says and I want to just remind you that the heart of God on that is that what he's given you and I hear is to be normative
[time=751] and this is what he's called us to this is the kind of living he invites you and I to and these are the questions what are the foundational truths of the Christian faith these are the questions we've been asking in recent days and as always
[time=769] here at Blackhawk it's been our it's been our study of God's word in this case I'll look at the book of first John that allows us to find answers to the questions you see there on the screen and direction as it relates to those very issues in chapter one you talk about normative or foundational Christian living and number one we saw that a proper view of in chapter one we saw that a proper view of Christ is normative
[time=798] if you raise your hand and say you're in if you raise your hand and say I'm a child of God if you raise your hand and say I'm a Christ follower first John lets you and I see that that a proper view of Christ is normative it's foundational
[time=814] for Christian living as we went on in chapter one we saw that a proper view of sin it's a foundational thing it's normative these are things we must understand these are things we must adhere to a proper view of Christ a proper view of sin we came to the to the
[time=833] third verse in chapter two last week Stephen I and we came to this test of obedience and again a proper view of obedience is something that John lays out for us here it's so imperative that if you raise your hand
[time=848] and say you're in that you and I would understand that with that declaration there is to come a perspective and engaging in this thing called obedience that is so very very vital to anybody who would name the name of Christ and profess to know him personally
[time=870] I'm so thankful for what Steve and I were able to share with you last week but as I look back at the passage this week I realized there was really a great truth or two or three several things at the end of that passage that we didn't get the chance
[time=885] to dive into and I want to jump into that this morning with you if we can chapter two verses three to six and my prayer this morning for all of you
[time=896] and my prayer since since I woke up this morning it's something that we've talked about often in recent months around here my prayer is that you would be and I would be today as we receive the word
[time=907] my prayer is that we would be as James described there yet we would not just be hearers of the word but that as we leave this place we would be what?
[time=916] doers that God would give you the grace and strength and that you would feel encouraged today to leave and to be a doer of what the word says
[time=927] and I'm here to tell you the words going to say some things today to you that I believe you and I need to do and be about
[time=936] so stand with me if you would in honor of God's word can I read to you again the passage from 1 John chapter 2 verses 3 to 6 a proper view a test if you will of obedience
[time=949] it says by this we know that we have come to know him if we keep his commandments the one who says I have come to know him and does not keep his commandments is a liar
[time=964] and the truth is not in him but whoever keeps his word in him the love of God has truly been perfected by this we know that we are in him by this we know that we are in him
[time=978] the one who says he abides in him, ought himself that's you and that's me that's us the one who says he abides in him, ought himself to walk in the same manner as he walked
[time=998] if we say we abide in him if you say you're in if you say and declare yourself to be a follower of Christ he says then your walk and mine ought to mirror his we ought to walk in the same manner as he walked
[time=1019] our God we stand before you this morning humbled by the thought I'll admit even at times defeated in our spirit by the thought of trying to always follow you to do what you did to do it the way you did it to think like you thought
[time=1043] and God we understand that while there can be struggle in that endeavor we also know that Father God your grace is sufficient and you want nothing more really than to come alongside and encourage and equip and teach and train
[time=1057] and build us up to be a people who could walk in that way and I'm so grateful for so many of the people in this room who I know have that as their desire they're not perfect God they haven't arrived there are so many rough edges that still need to be chipped away
[time=1072] but God so many of us here have a desire to honor you and to because we abide in your son God we desire to walk in the same manner as he walked and we just come to you God and we beg you to day for help in that endeavor
[time=1090] we want to walk like he walked and we pray God that because of our time with you this morning and because of the great life changing power of your word that we could be moved in that direction by you
[time=1103] oh please do it in your son's name we pray amen you can be seated in the same manner as he walked if we abide in him that's how we ought to walk
[time=1117] so let me ask you the question how did Jesus walk go ahead and just think about that for a moment your mind may just immediately go to a number of places great just go ahead and just list a few off in your mind
[time=1129] how did Jesus walk and most of you in the room understand the phrase walk I think as it's being stated here we're not talking about his gate we're not talking about how his legs moved
[time=1141] we're talking about how he lived we're talking about how he chose we're talking about his values we're talking about the way he interacted we're talking about his priorities we're talking about the way he conducted himself in the everyday of life the way he walked
[time=1158] so how did he walk as I think about that and as I you know I get my pen out and I start writing a few things down a bunch of things come to my mind I believe that he walked faithfully
[time=1171] I believe that our Lord was faithful I don't think he was unfaithful I think he was true to what he was called to I think his walk his conduct his attitude his choices I think they were faithful I think he walked faithfully
[time=1186] I think he walked you know what I as I'm reading back through the gospels I don't know when the last time it was where you just sat down and began to read through the gospels with the intent of trying to figure out and see patterns in his life
[time=1199] rhythms that he that he found him that he purposely gave himself to I don't know when the last time was that you read through the gospels to look and to see and to learn and observe how Jesus lived it's an amazing study it's a great read
[time=1213] and one thing you realize as you read through there again and again and again is that there's no wasted movement there's no wasted time there's no coincidence there's no lazy he he walked with great purpose is what I'm saying
[time=1230] he walked with great purpose purpose to what he did whose purpose God's eternal purpose oh so many things you could write down he was faithful he walked with purpose I think I would I would say he walked with great love he didn't walk with great greed
[time=1246] he didn't walk with great hostility he didn't walk with great anger he didn't why he walked with great love again and again and again
[time=1255] but let me have you add this to the list this morning and I think this is the point to be made here today because I think it's the point again of the text that we find ourselves in in chapter two verses three to six my friends Jesus walked obediently
[time=1268] would you just write that down he walked obediently Jesus Christ Jesus our Lord Jesus of Nazareth he walked he conducted himself he was obedient you say how was Jesus obedient you say what's an example of Jesus choosing obedience
[time=1288] that maybe you and I can learn from Cali well there's again many places we could go with that how was Jesus obedient what do you think I'll bring you back to Joe's song that he sang a little bit ago I hope you caught the words at the beginning of that song that that scene is depicted and it's a scene that I don't know about you but I haven't spent a lot of time in my life really thinking about what it must have been like for Jesus the Son of God
[time=1317] and you have God the Father and you have God the Holy Spirit you have from eternity past forever and ever and ever there has been this triune Godhead and they've always been together and they've always been close and there's always been just one God one God three persons right one God three functions
[time=1338] Father God Son and Holy Spirit but there they were and here's Jesus the Son of God and God comes to him and I don't know when it was exactly I don't know what it must have been like I wonder what the scene was like but there was a time when God the Father says to God the Son you're going to go
[time=1364] I need to redeem them and you are my plan and you are going to go and Jesus at some point in some circumstance or situation in the heavenlies said what let me think about it no he obeyed he obeyed the Father and he came and we're going to come back to that
[time=1392] in a little bit gosh other examples of Jesus obeying I as you read through the gospels I found over 40 times over 40 times you see and you can just you can just do this in the gospels and probably read a page and come to it where Jesus says again and again and again and again you see Jesus saying it again and again I have come to do the will of my what
[time=1419] my father I have come I exist I am here to do one thing I am here Jesus would say again and again and again to obey the Father I have come to do the will of me no I have come to do the will of the people no I have come to do the will of the Father and he says it again and again and again
[time=1443] we saw you this morning if we're back at 1 John chapter 2 verse 6 and if we say we abide in him we ought ourselves to walk in the same manner and if we've determined this morning that especially in light of our text the manner in which he walked was obedience
[time=1461] if I'm going to show you an example of the obedience and the significance of that obedience and all that came with that obedience if there's one place I want to take you it's the Philippians chapter 2 and would you turn there with me this morning the Philippians chapter 2 verses 5 to 8
[time=1481] Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians go to Philippians chapter 2 verses 5 to 8 and let me read this for you if I can the obedience of Christ and this morning I want you to kind of turn your attention and I want to invite your thinking to be kind of kind of aimed toward this thought and that is that which Christ sacrificed
[time=1507] that which Christ gave up to obey listen Philippians 2 5 to 8 have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus there is the attitude that was in Christ who although he existed in the form of God remember eternity past
[time=1530] although he existed in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped but emptied himself taking the form of a bond servant and being made in the likeness of men being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself by becoming everybody say it out loud
[time=1554] go ahead obedient he humbled himself don't forget that don't think about obedience without thinking about humility don't think about obedience my friends without thinking about humility
[time=1572] he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of what say it death even death on a cross my friends there is almost always and I would invite you this morning to just consider this at a very honest and personal level there is almost always a price that comes with obedience
[time=1598] there are there are at times things we give up when we're willing to do the will of the Father this morning I would want every one of us to be reminded of how obedient Jesus was because he said in essence just in the vernacular of our day realize of course Jesus raised his hand and said I'm in
[time=1620] Jesus claimed to be a child of God the son of God actually but Jesus was one who said I abide in him and first John tells you and me that when we say we abide in him we ourselves ought to walk in the same manner as he walked
[time=1635] so here's Jesus saying I'm in I'm in and I want you to see again this morning what the obedience what the obedience of Jesus Christ evidenced it didn't make him a child of God it proved that he was a child of God
[time=1653] and I want you to see what he gave up to be obedient what he said no to in order to say yes to God let me say that again what he said no to in order to say yes to God what he sacrificed in order to be obedient
[time=1672] now let me just ask you this personally here this morning what is it because I believe in every life in every life of every person in this room who knows him every one of you that are doing your best with his help to follow Christ every one of you that says
[time=1690] I've fully surrendered my heart and life to him and I'm doing my very best with God's help to honor and to follow and to be who God's called me to be every one of you in this room I would bet you anything this morning that there's something in your life
[time=1707] there's some arena in your life there's some activity in your life there's something going on today in your life and he is calling you he's nudging you he's prodding you the spirit of God is the word of God is maybe the people of God are but I just I'd bet you anything there's somebody in this room this morning
[time=1728] and God is calling you to a greater level of obedience there's something going on in your life and God is trying to get your attention and he is trying to say to you as forthrightly and lovingly and as clearly as possible
[time=1744] hey would you please obey me but you also know like I know that this obedience will most likely cost you it may cost you personal or relational comfort it may cost you a friendship it may cost you money
[time=1773] money that you think is yours but really is his may cost you time that you think is yours but really is his this obedience it may cost you it may cost you popularity young person it may cost you popularity older person
[time=1796] I don't know what it is that he's doing in your soul I'm not sure what arena of your life he's trying to get your attention in but I bet in most of your hearts and souls here today those of you that know him he wants for you a greater expression of obedience
[time=1819] it may not be what you want but it might be best it may mean the loss of control but God is saying to you follow me obey me trust me and I want you to see this morning as we think about this I want you to see this morning from the pages of scripture
[time=1839] I want to remind you what Jesus gave up to obey Philippians chapter two verses five to eight I want you to first of all look with me at chapters at verses five and six and I want you to see that right out of the gate you want you to write this down
[time=1855] He gave up divine position Philippians two five and six have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus who unbelievable verse one of the most unbelievable verses you'll ever come to who although he existed in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped
[time=1884] He gave up divine position okay look at the phrase there he existed in the form of God the truth of the Trinity reminds us that while what we said earlier is true that Christ has been an eternity past Christ has been the son of God right
[time=1903] everybody who agrees with that say amen nod your head an eternity past the truth of the Trinity reminds us that Christ has been the son of God well but at the same time he has at the very same time always been who God
[time=1920] it's the great mind bender of the Trinity it's the great truth that we continue to just try our best to put our arms around while he has been the son of God he has also been from eternity past and remains today to be as we talk about the deity of Christ he is who
[time=1938] God he is God he existed in the form of God he existed in the form of Paul reminds us of this great truth that Christ Jesus the son of God existed in the very form of God
[time=1956] the word in the Greek for existed look at that you see it there the word in the Greek for existed is the word that means the very essence of a person's nature
[time=1967] I mean we're cutting right to the core here and when it says that he existed in the form of God by the use of that word the writer here says the very essence he was he wasn't just sort of like he wasn't similar no he was the very essence
[time=1984] of God the word means the very essence of a person's nature once continuous state or condition and that's how Jesus the son of God existed in eternity past while he was the son of God he was the very nature of God
[time=2003] in a continuous sense never ending never changing never being altered he was God now I have a son I have two sons and it's great to see the younger one kind of coming along and continuing to grow up I have an older son who's 15 and there are some who say he looks like me
[time=2027] and I'm sorry for his sake but he does it's true he looks like me I'll see him I'll walk down our hallway sometimes and he'll be in his his bathroom kind of you know getting ready doing whatever and I'll just walk by and I'll look in the mirror and I'll look at him
[time=2047] and I'll think my goodness I just looked at that that's me he says things like me it's really funny you know you've been there you've been in the kitchen and you've heard you've heard him or her kind of yell down the hall something and you just sit there and kind of smile and go oh my goodness
[time=2071] the apple did not fall far from the tree did it he walks he walks like me he ran I went to a watch them play basketball in the night and me and a friend were kind of just giggling he runs like me
[time=2094] as mannerisms like me but watch this but he's and I know this is basic but I just want you to see this and maybe in an arena that you can maybe seems more tangible to you he's my son but he's not but he's not me
[time=2110] very essence is him he has a distinct and different essence to him I'm me he's him Jesus son of God God the father saying Jesus the Son of God existed in the very form of God he was the son in function but had always been by nature God and one of the most
[time=2135] mind boggling truths you'll ever see one of the most significant parts of a verse you'll ever read one of the most counter cultural counter human truths that scripture brings forth is the statement that you come to at the end of verse six
[time=2153] go ahead and look at it with me who although he existed in the form of God here it is did not regard equality with God a thing to be what say it
[time=2167] it's an amazing word in the original language and you can visualize it I think you can see it you've all wanted something so desperately you've all wanted something so deeply there have been times in your life maybe a serious instance where something was really on the line and you grabbed for something maybe not life threatening but other situations where you can remember holding on to someone or something
[time=2195] that's what that's what grasped in the Greek means it means to clutch with great purpose it means to embrace with great passion it's a prized object that's held on to with great intent
[time=2212] I can think about I don't know how many of you are feeding I don't know how many of you are feeding babies right now not like right now in the room but like in your life
[time=2221] I don't know how many of you are got little infants at home and you know not even just infants but three four five however many months you know I just can remember that like it was yesterday and I remember bottles
[time=2233] and I don't know about you but I've got this memory of bottles it always just it was amazing to me how this little blob and let's just be honest they're blobsed
[time=2242] they don't do anything they don't think they don't have minds yet they get dressed they poop they pee that's just what they do and you feed them and you give them you know nutrition and that's just all they do so you sit there and so I would sit there with my five when they were that age
[time=2258] and it was amazing to me the bottle because they don't really know much but you put that bottle in their mouth and you even had to sometimes write you had to kind of take their you remember how you take their fingers and you kind of put it around the bottle
[time=2270] so they could hold it so you could watch TV or so you could do other things and it was just always amazing to me how this little blob that didn't know anything once you got that bottle in and you got their hands placed for them around it
[time=2287] now take it away little blobs that won't let go they grasp those bottles like nobody's business because it's so good it's so necessary it's so right it's so important and he and he let's go he let's go
[time=2316] of equality with God you know what equality means in the Greek it means being exactly the same in size capacity character performance and appearance he's equal with God and he lets it go he does not grasp it in order to obey God so that redemptive history could take place and you and I could be saved amen
[time=2342] so what was the obedient thing that Christ did here I want to just point this out to you still under the idea of of divine position I want you to think about this practically we're trying to be as practical as we can here
[time=2355] what was the obedient thing that he did look at the first phrase of verse seven he didn't regard equality with God a thing to be grasped but he what say it he emptied himself he emptied himself my friends would you look at that phrase on the screen would you just look at that
[time=2377] he emptied himself the obedient thing that he did was that he emptied himself please look at that what is it that God is showing you these days that you need to do come on be honest
[time=2394] what obedient choice is he asking you to make be reminded this morning that it will most likely involve that phrase right there an emptying of yourself which is a good thing because when you and I empty ourselves that is the end of you and the beginning of Christ in who
[time=2418] Christ in you and you want that all my friends when we're talking about obedience when we're talking about walking this path with him in a way that brings honor and glory to him and we're talking about the normative ways in which we should live and follow him
[time=2433] you want it to be Christ in you and not who you and the only way that happens is when you and I on a regular basis empty ourselves we kneel down we lay down we sit down before him and we say I'm done
[time=2452] I don't want to do this I don't want to try to do this I don't want to strive to do this anymore I don't want this to be about my efforts oh God please fill me
[time=2463] with the power and the strength and the grace of your son and your spirit he emptied himself for Christ Jesus obedience meant giving up
[time=2477] giving up some things you and I can hardly conceive of divine position was given up so that he could obey number two he gave up all this is incredible look at this the intimacy and glory of heavenly relationship
[time=2491] it's kind of long but write it down he gave up in order to obey Christ gave up the intimacy and glory of heavenly relationship the intimacy and glory
[time=2505] let's just start with intimacy and we'll just be brief most of you I hope kind of catch the essence of what we're saying they're Christ and God and the Holy Spirit there was in that triune God had there was community
[time=2521] there was togetherness there was oneness there was closeness there was a proximity there was love and there wasn't anything getting in the way nothing on the intimacy level it was as pure as it's ever been he was as close to God as you could I mean you couldn't imagine
[time=2545] the intimacy that he had there the love that flowed and the spirit that existed there and the closeness it was absolutely unspeakable he gives up the intimacy and glory and glory
[time=2561] of his heavenly position of that heavenly relationship glory this is a tough one I can tell you I feel like as a communicator I can describe for you the intimacy that he left his glory things kind of tough
[time=2575] I mean I've been thinking about it all week and I've been reading and I've been looking and you know what I'm just going to try my best and I hope this connects with you when I say to you that he gave up the glory of his heavenly relationship
[time=2590] he gave up them he gave up the constant never ending never subsiding never being altered never being diminished he gave up the constant wow he gave up the constant whoa he gave up the constant light and the splendor and the majesty
[time=2615] and the glory and the brightness and the trumpet and the thunder and the you got to be kidding me of existing in the very presence of God an existence that you and I really can't even in our human minds begin to comprehend or imagine but he had it
[time=2632] always there never going away always present intimacy and glory and while on earth he gives it up he gives up the continuous and personal enjoyment of the love and the glory he chooses think about it instead of that he chooses discomfort
[time=2648] he chooses to be disadvantaged he chooses loss in order to obey he chooses earth he chooses death he chooses pain clouds rain people futility godless culture
[time=2667] John 17 look at that with me would you the gospel of John Matthew Mark Luke John go to John 17 Jesus spoke these things John 17 1 Jesus spoke these things this is as he now nears the end of his time on earth
[time=2685] Jesus spoke these things and lifting up his eyes to heaven he said I love this Father the hour has come glorify your son that the son may glorify you even as you gave him authority over all flesh
[time=2703] that to that to all whom you have given him he may give eternal life and this is verse 3 this is eternal life that they may know you the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent
[time=2722] I love this I glorified you on the earth having accomplished having obeyed I glorified you on the earth having accomplished the work which you have given me to do now verse 5 listen now Father glorify me together with yourself with the glory which I had with you before the world was there it is
[time=2748] all how he longed to be back with the Father in the glory of that relationship that was before the world was made and he gave it up to be obedient so you and I could come to faith and know that glory and someday be with him
[time=2770] let me ask you this how disadvantaged are you willing to be to obey God how much discomfort are you willing to experience and your effort to truly honor and obey him
[time=2791] he is trying to do my best to have this that can at times seem so far off because it's about him I want it to be so very near and real to you so you look at what he did and I think it gives you the opportunity to think about
[time=2808] that which you and I at times may have to give up how disadvantaged are you willing to be how much discomfort are you willing to take in an effort to obey God
[time=2819] to autonomous authority write that down Christ gave up autonomous number three Christ gave up autonomous authority and just think about this we're going to do this briefly here he had always think about eternity past all right
[time=2833] he had always been in eternity past able to do whatever he wanted to do whenever he wanted to do it however he wanted to get it done there was no confinement there were no restrictions
[time=2846] it was just him it was him in the Godhead with God the Father and the Holy Spirit but now now we move from absolute unconfinement we move from absolute freedom we move from the glory of the heavenlies and the ability to go wherever he wanted to go and to do whatever he wanted to do to the womb of a fourteen year old girl
[time=2873] like that here's the amazing thing you ever stop and think about this he was cognizant I believe most most little ones in wombs this was Jesus in the womb
[time=2887] and he never ever ever ever ever stopped being yes he was human little thing in the womb but he was also God in the womb never ever lost a sense of who he was and where he was
[time=2900] so there he was in the womb of a fourteen year old it's like Donald Trump living on eighteen grand a year I mean think about going from absolute whatever you want to just whoa whoa whoa all of a sudden here we are completely
[time=2919] and absolutely confined and not just the womb of a thirteen year old but in time the unspeakable beating and torture of the cross and all the while he chooses to say over forty times in the gospel father your will not who's mine
[time=2943] your will not mine be done say that with me repeat after me father your will not mine be done we can kind of get into that we can kind of do a repetition thing maybe you did a repetition thing on that one growing up it's okay I'm just saying that
[time=2960] even what we just did right there you know that can sound kind of repetitive and we can kind of say that but I don't want it to be repetitive for you today I want it to be real
[time=2970] say it slower father repeat after me father your will not mine be done father your will slow not mine
[time=2999] not mine be done what's he trying to get you to do what does he want you to make right where does he want you to go what needs to change what obedience is he calling you to there is a subjugation of our wills there is this autonomous authority
[time=3024] that Christ gives up and he calls you and I to give up the very same thing I found an amazing passage look with me quickly would you Hebrews five Hebrews five would you go back there toward the back just before you get to the book of James go to Hebrews five
[time=3039] seven I love this I know I always say that it's true I love it Hebrews five seven to ten look at this in the days of his flesh how's that in the days of his flesh he offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crime this is this is Jesus alright God in the flesh
[time=3066] he's offering up prayers and supplications do you understand what supplications mean supplication means oh God help me supplication is a cry of need supplication is a cry of request supplication is I can't do it oh God I need you to for me or for them
[time=3083] in the days of his flesh he offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the one able to save him from death and he was heard because of his piety although he was a son capital S he learned say it out loud
[time=3100] obedience from the things which he suffered and unless he had given up his his autonomous authority he never would have and having been made perfect then he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation
[time=3118] being designated by God as a high what say it priest according to the order of Melchizedek oh what he gave up he gave up eternal riches would you write that down number four he gave up eternal riches
[time=3135] we sometimes don't think about this while on earth Christ was poor do you understand that maybe you missed it in all the bible stories maybe as you've read him again to your kids I don't know if it ever sunk in but there's no condo
[time=3157] there's no horse I mean I mean he borrowed a few that I mean that he he was poor my friends he was poor and chose to own very little he gave up riches you know he owned it all you know he made it all you know he had it all and he gives it all up
[time=3177] and he's poor and he chooses to own very little now what is there for you and I to learning that what is there for you and I to think about him that well think about this physically in the material sense I think there's some great truth there for us to consider think about it this way let me just ask your question what is it that allows an individual
[time=3195] let's go with a kid let's go with a child what is it that allows a child to have a better shot at learning to be like Christ what is it that would give a kid a better opportunity at learning to be like Christ we'll say it this way at learning to be obedient
[time=3217] extreme wealth and privilege or extreme poverty and need and I'm asking honestly which of the two tends to foster or could tend to foster an attitude of dependence or obedience most efficiently
[time=3240] now my point isn't that wealthy people can't obey God it's not true first of all the scriptures are filled with with obedient wealthy people and I know a bunch myself and maybe you do as well that's not my point
[time=3258] my point is this my point is simply this the message this morning is what Jesus gave up the message this morning is about obedience and my point is Jesus didn't have any stuff to get in the way of his obedience
[time=3271] that's my point now you deal with and I deal with that
[time=3277] and you deal with that and I need to deal with that to the degree that I need to I need to be obedient in how I deal with that and make sure that there isn't a bunch of stuff getting in the way of me or me helping my kids know what it means to really be dependent on him
[time=3297] he gave up everything for a stable pair of sandals many a night on the ground and finally a crown a crown made of thorns so he could be obedient look at 2 Corinthians 8 9 we just talked there for a moment about kind of the physical material world and the possibility I think
[time=3317] for you and I to make some application there look at spiritually look how this is is written it's a powerful truth 2 Corinthians 8 9 for you know 2 Corinthians Paul second letter here to the church at Corinth he says for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was what say it out loud
[time=3337] yet for your sake he became what say it so that you through his what might become what say it well for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sake he became he let it go
[time=3356] emptied himself became poor so that through his poverty and what he experienced there with God the Father in that poverty we might become rich IE saved redeemed given hope
[time=3373] just look at the screen would you look at all those there's some more there but we'll stop we'll stop with that just kind of go back through there what Christ gave up divine position
[time=3384] position the intimacy and glory of heavenly relationship autonomous authority eternal riches I'll add one that's not going to be up there let me just say this to you didn't even come to me first hour but I'm just sitting here thinking
[time=3399] about it now you know what else he gave up and this one's just hard to even think about he gave up he was willing to go without God's affection for a moment there
[time=3426] all of his father who he was so close to in love so deeply the one he had been so obedient for the one he had given himself to thoroughly whose affection he had known from eternity past he gave it up so that you and I could have his affection
[time=3450] and his love and I think that's amazing and I don't know what it is God's calling you to do my friends I don't know what act or acts of obedience he's trying to move or prod or nudge you toward but I pray that you would be willing
[time=3467] to give up some things and I think Christ gives us this morning a great example and I hope that you'll follow it and if you need some help I hope you'll ask because we would love nothing more than to come alongside and provide that very thing for you
