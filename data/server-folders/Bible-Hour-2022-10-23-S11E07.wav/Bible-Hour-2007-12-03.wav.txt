[time=233] Hi I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and as always we're thankful that you've tuned in and as always we are always excited about chances to share with you
[time=245] opportunities here in our community that we feel like are really making a difference.
[time=250] We're so thankful for Christian radio, so thankful for the legacy that it's had here over the years
[time=257] and also very grateful for the innovation that's taking place on that front and I am so thankful
[time=263] that a new friend of mine and a new friend of Black Hawk's Clinton Foppel who is leading an effort
[time=270] with an organization called remedy.fm. Did I say that right? That's right, remedy FM. Remedy FM
[time=276] and the unique thing about remedy FM that I'm so thankful for is that it is online. Remedy FM
[time=283] is an opportunity for those who spend time online which you and I know is a lot of people and especially
[time=290] a lot of younger people and you know my heart, you know Black Hawk's heart for this next generation
[time=296] and so I've asked Clinton if he would just come and share with you kind of the vision behind remedy FM and the things that they hope God will allow them to do in the days to come with this next
[time=307] generation. Yeah well but a year and a half ago Kelly we had an experience, Charbenkley kind of the visionary behind remedy FM had an experience with the current state of hip-hop music and mainstream
[time=319] media really took her on a journey that she wasn't expecting to take and allowed her to see
[time=326] how poorly right now the the the level of the bar is when it comes to the kind of media we're
[time=332] feeding our young people and so she started asking questions or whether or not we could begin to dream a new dream for a radio station for teens, positive music, all kinds of different genres but kind of a station that would would tackle the issues be real be relevant and be interactive and
[time=349] so out of that dreamt up this idea of remedy FM a website that both plays positive music just like a regular radio station would but uses video chat instant messaging texting all the different
[time=361] formats that kids are into these days and really provides this great remedy which we believe is Jesus Christ and it does it in a relevant way using all kinds of different forms and and we're excited about it we've been in a month now and we've already had over 5,000 people listen and from all over the world and we're just going to keep going. Awesome awesome well as you can see on the screen I've had the guys put down some contact information for Clinton and for the remedy team
[time=387] if you have any questions things that you'd like to suggest if you'd like to get to know Clinton and his team they would love to get to know you there are a number of opportunities
[time=397] for you and those in this community to come alongside this amazing effort we're thankful for this new friendship and want to invite every one of you to visit remedy FM in the days to come God bless you have a great week and as always we hope to see you soon.

[time=1190] all is well
[time=1220] well welcome to our series on first john i got a question for you today how many people here raise your hand will encounter someone who's difficult to love during
[time=1232] the holiday season raise your hand please i'll raise them high look at that how many people your hands down how many people raise your hand if you are the difficult person raise your hand see that's that's the irony of the whole thing the question that we look at today is does my life
[time=1248] reflect the loving heart of christ even with those who are difficult to love even with those
[time=1257] who are difficult to love a lot of different ways of categorize the difficult people and difficult behavior i kind of like this one idea where they fall into four quadrants one would be an aggressive
[time=1270] person who desires control so much that life kind of gets out of control the second one would be
[time=1278] the complainer kind of a perfectionist wants things to be just a certain way so much so that
[time=1285] they never are and the desire security uh and tries to pursue that at the expense of others and
[time=1291] themselves in a way that they end up being insecure now those two the aggressive and the complainer they're kind of direct about their difficult behavior but then we have uh two the other two are kind of indirect with their difficult behavior and uh that would be the people please are first uh he has this desire for significance so especially this relational significance with
[time=1310] people and uh says yes to everybody and kind of creates conflict by default interests collide
[time=1317] later on because two people were told yes but their interests were different uh then the final one
[time=1323] would be the passive resistive person who kind of desires contentment so much avoids conflict
[time=1332] at all costs but had it has this kind of hidden will of iron that just stops and is immovable and unteachable desires contentment so much at times apart from god that the life is is discontent i
[time=1345] only share that for you to maybe think about how you're difficult a little bit and not for you to stereotype anybody but for this reason for blind spots for blind spots because we have a tendency
[time=1358] to see other people only through the lenses of our own experiences and we miss who they are and in
[time=1365] many ways what our text today will show uh is this issue of blind spots and it's the love test
[time=1374] for authentic light and i really think in a way what it's saying is if you want to move
[time=1383] from blindness to sight then turn from darkness to light
[time=1389] if you want to move from blindness to sight then turn from darkness to light please stand and
[time=1401] i'll read the passage today uh it's first john chapter two verses seven through eleven
[time=1408] dear friends i'm not writing you a new command but an old one which you have had since the beginning
[time=1416] this old command is the message you have heard yet i'm writing you a new command
[time=1423] it's truth is seen in him and you because the darkness is passing and the true light
[time=1429] is already shining anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still
[time=1437] in the darkness whoever loves his brother lives in the light and there is nothing in him to make
[time=1447] him stumble but whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness
[time=1457] he does not know where he's going because the darkness has blinded him and god please through the power of your holy spirit the spirit of christ who is alive in here
[time=1470] right now make it well with our hearts god show us our blind spots and by the power of your love
[time=1479] and the light of who you are we pray that you would do heart surgery today and remove those in jesus name amen you may be seated i'm going to give you four images today to kind of remember
[time=1492] what i'd like you to try to do to apply the passage uh uh the four images we'll talk about what they mean as we go but the first one is a lego lego second one is a shield
[time=1502] a shield that's kind of cool third one is a mirror
[time=1513] and the fourth one is a highway sign a big highway sign
[time=1519] oh that's nice thank you Val what we see first we're gonna look at first john two seven and eight
[time=1526] first is love if you want to write it down love is the old and new command love is the old and new
[time=1532] command we know he's talking about love because of verse five and some other things uh prior to this usage and what he's going to say in this context as well first john two seven through eight dear friends i'm not writing you a new command but an old one which you have had since the beginning this old command is the message you have heard yet i am writing you a new command it's truth is seen
[time=1552] in him and you because the darkness is passing in the true light is already shining love is the old
[time=1559] and the new command beloved or dear friends beloved in nesb dear friends here is a is a form of the
[time=1566] word agape it's used 61 times in the new testament who must have been a common endearing term
[time=1572] used for a fellow believer and it's like john is saying oh man i love you so much would you please
[time=1578] listen please see what i'm about to say here and in ancient language it would use paradox in order
[time=1587] to uh gain capture the mind of the audience the gaining capture the mind of the audience so it's
[time=1593] true that love is an old commander we'll see that it's true that it's a new command we need to see what he's saying there uh but he's getting ready to say say this is super important this is foundational this is really really big and that's why he uses the paradox old not new on the other
[time=1608] hand new first we see that it's an old command first john two seven to love god love god love god
[time=1619] that's the old command look at uh dude eronomy six five dude eronomy six five love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul and with all your strength not some
[time=1633] but all the pattern we're going to see it also is an old command to love others
[time=1639] that was the greatest vertical commandment the greatest horizontal commandment is the love others libidicus nineteen eighteen do not seek revenge or bear grudge against one of your people
[time=1650] but love your neighbor as yourself i am the lord you know it's the person with a secret
[time=1656] revenge or bear grudge against they're difficult it's the what's what's going on there but instead we're supposed to love others now it's a new command there's a little clue in verse eight it says i'm
[time=1666] writing a new command it's truth is seen in him and you the true light is already shining it's a new
[time=1675] commandment in that it is new in the clarity of the life of christ it is new in the clarity of the
[time=1682] life of christ because he is the true light already shining now john god is from jesus in john 1334
[time=1691] records jesus saying this a new command i give you love one another as i have loved you
[time=1698] so you must love one another now let's leave it on the screen now we just read it thousands of years prior uh the old testament said love your neighbors yourself so what's jesus saying a new command i
[time=1709] give you love one another what makes it new is as i have loved you the clarity of god in the flesh
[time=1718] walking the earth and how he did it the clarity of the love that christ had for other people
[time=1725] and this is a big idea in the new testament and that idea is that loving others if you
[time=1732] want to write it down loving others fulfills the law loving others fulfills the law look what jesus
[time=1739] said in the sermon on the mount matthew seven twelve it's a familiar verse probably so in everything due to others what you would have them due to you for this sums up the law and the prophets
[time=1752] quoting the old commands the vertical and the horizontal commandments the great ones jesus
[time=1758] said in matthew twenty two verses thirty seven through forty jesus replied he's asked a bottom line what this whole thing is about a relationship with god jesus is fine love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment
[time=1774] and the second is like it it's inseparable it's not going to happen if the first one's not going to happen if you don't do the second the second's not going to happen if you don't do the first the way i've intended it jesus is saying love your neighbor as yourself now listen to this we tend to just gloss over this part all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments john's coming right in to this teaching that he was present for
[time=1798] paul said it romans thirteen ten look how he said it love does no harm to its neighbor
[time=1804] therefore love is the fulfillment of the law Galatians five fourteen paul said the entire law is
[time=1810] summed up in a single command love your neighbor as yourself and james the half brother of jesus
[time=1817] and james two eight says if you really keep the royal law found in scripture it's love your neighbor as yourself and you are doing right so what is love what's the idea
[time=1829] there are several words as many of you know in greek for love there's a romantic word for love romantic love there's a a word for a brotherly love and then there's this this word agape
[time=1841] that's used here agape a self sacrificial serving a self sacrificial serving now listen
[time=1850] as you might want to write this one down a selfless act of service a selfless act of service
[time=1856] that risks my gifts that risks my resources of life that risks my time my talent and my treasures
[time=1866] look how jesus kind of said it in luke nine verses 23 and 24 then he said to them all if anyone
[time=1872] would come after me he must deny himself his selfishness and take up his cross daily and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will save it
[time=1887] look how peter in a way interprets that idea in first peter four ten each one should use whatever
[time=1894] gift whatever gift he has received to serve others faithfully administering god's grace
[time=1903] his undeserved love is unmarried in favor in its various forms it'll be unique and relational in every part of life so what's the big idea it's an old command it's a new command what's he saying
[time=1915] write it down here it is love flows from the heart of god love flows from the heart of god
[time=1922] self sacrificial love selfless act of service love flows from the heart of god and its ultimate
[time=1932] clarity was in the loving life of christ john 3 16 jesus said um john records
[time=1943] it's a great question whether jesus said it or whether you know john's writing it for god so loved the world that he gave his only only now i want you to hang on that word right now
[time=1955] only god so loved that he gave those things go together we're going to serve with our time
[time=1963] talent treasure is going to cost us something to love somebody self sacrificial but when that word only we got a god who gives it all that's saying he gave it all we have a tendency in
[time=1974] our fallenness i think god just gives a little bit god just god just cut off a little bit god gave his only god gives all he's that kind of god and god wants us to do the same with how
[time=1990] we love other people i help coach girls basketball liquid park christian school david robins who is an outstanding coach i came up with this idea that i thought it was a holy spirit prompting that we would develop a vision mission and values including objectives goals and strategies all image based
[time=2004] so we could assimilate in the life of each girl and in case anything would happen to us they would have something that it could continue to develop and and build the program and i said coach i'm kind of thinking that the vision would be champions for life there'll be champions for life eternity on this side at least and there'll be champions uh for life in the practical part of life i said
[time=2024] but the mission is what we're going to do to get there and i said so i was looking at these verses and luke and first peter and i'm thinking about how to say it i said you know i don't know losing to save losing to win losing to find there's something about losing that selfishness it's
[time=2038] really important in the team sport now david is a hip hop artist david has written all kinds of christian hip hop songs he's unbelievable you're going to hear him someday we've heard him in common ground before david goes immediately i get the i barely get the last consonant out of my uh mouth
[time=2053] and david says about like dying to win yeah i love that that sounds a lot better losing to win i'd
[time=2063] like that dying to win dying to your selfishness to win and here's what that means the team results
[time=2070] are going to be greater than the personal results the team results are going to be greater than the personal results and that means i have to die to my selfishness i tell you where there's a problem
[time=2080] when you lose and a girl has a great game and she leaves all giddy and happy while everybody
[time=2089] else is in mourning thinking about how we're going to correct this and turn the l into a w that's a no-go on dying to win or the opposite which has happened both these have happened
[time=2103] you win and a girl concerned about her own playing time while everybody's happy as they're leaving
[time=2110] walks out crying now you know what i can't hardly blame the girls because even in my own home i can
[time=2117] see that in our fallenness we measure success with all those kids who play team sports by selfish
[time=2125] results how much you score why didn't such and such pasture the ball why didn't this happen why
[time=2132] didn't that happen and it's all about you you you me me me well it's a team sport but it's kind of awkward giving away individual wars for team sports you know how it applies to us is that the team is the church and our goal is the kingdom of god
[time=2149] to advance the the development of the heart of christ and its unique expression in every single person that we lock eyes with and we got to die to win we got to ask ourselves this is what i want
[time=2161] you to do to apply i want you to ask myself ask yourself am i dying to win is the true light really shining in me am i characterized and known by selfless acts of service
[time=2171] what about with that difficult person the person who's difficult to love and here's the
[time=2177] lego image if you want to write it down how you can apply it in your life connect connect like a lego with god and others connect like a lego with the heart of god and with the heart of others it's
[time=2188] very important the heart of god and the heart of others
[time=2212] old in the new commandment it flows from the heart of god where to love god and love others we have to connect with god in order to connect with others and when we connect with others
[time=2223] we're connecting with god at work connect like a lego second we see in verse nine love is the test
[time=2230] for authentic light love is the test for authentic light both with god and with others verse nine
[time=2237] anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness anyone who
[time=2243] claims to be in the light says i'm connected with god but it hates his brother is still in the darkness let's see how this works with god the gnostics or the gnostic christians that we talked a lot about claimed to be in the light but they were referring to their own enlightenment light was a metaphor for god as well for them but not really the true god or even christians were
[time=2263] messed up they thought it was applying to the true god but they were melting with christ teachings
[time=2270] this Gnosticism philosophy we do the same thing today with postmodernism and christianity but they would remove the gnostics would remove their need for forgiveness so they hardened their hearts for god they believed in this out-of-body mystical mental experience that came from enlightenment and so the body that was evil it could kind of do whatever it wanted to created a dualism which was really hard to handle and hard to understand and then also they would separate themselves from people they didn't think this is kind of the other side of it they would separate themselves from people they didn't think was righteous or enlightened as they were and so that was darkness they hardened their hearts toward god and that was darkness they hardened their hearts with others it says anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother brother can either refer to
[time=2313] a fellow believer or anyone made an image of god and we got to be careful here we got to be
[time=2322] careful here see the gnostics it separated themselves from other people and so that's why how we handle ourselves with other people is the evidence of love many of us want to say what uh i've heard
[time=2334] christians say now and then and i struggle with it is i'm called to love you but not to like you
[time=2341] i'm called to love you but not to like you i think that's a slippery slope
[time=2351] the context here for brother might be i'd lean a little towards it means a fellow believer however you can't just say well who they're good i can only i don't have to love people in the church i don't have to love that idiot oh my goodness you know it makes it so easy i got to pass out well no no no no no no no Jesus said he defined neighbor as everyone
[time=2372] Jesus was really really strong in this teaching so now we got to look at what hate is what is hate
[time=2378] missio in greek it's a present participle i want you to get this it's a present participle in greek which implies a continual activity or habit hate yes used here means a continual activity or habit
[time=2390] it's not a disagreement it's not anger it's not shouting it's not a season of boundaries between us it's not a timeout it's a continual present activity or habit but what is it what is
[time=2406] hate see as i studied this word a little bit and it's really an interesting thing when you try to
[time=2412] define it hate can either be hot i found or cold hot or cold if you want to write it down hot it
[time=2418] can be a malicious intent i hate that guy i'll deliver thing i can to hurt that guy
[time=2424] or it can be cold which is more like a disregard or an aversion to or dislike that's why i really
[time=2433] struggle with that statement i'm called the love you but not to like you so it's hot or cold it's either malicious intent or cold a disregard hate really needs to be defined by the positive
[time=2444] hate is really an absence of love it's an absence of of a selfless act of service so hate therefore
[time=2452] would be a selfish act of disservice if you want to write it down a selfish act of disservice
[time=2458] and the word hate here implies that somebody must be difficult if it's getting to that point
[time=2465] we're talking about people who are hard to love loving the unlovely hating those opposed to god
[time=2472] was actually taught by the essence who broke themselves off as a separate community uh in the kumran in the caves of kumran in 1947 we found scrolls in there was i think the oldest copy still found of the scroll for isiah well also were scrolls of how they did life and they actually used
[time=2488] the light and darkness metaphor and they actually taught as christians as followers of christ they
[time=2494] say love the sons of light hate the sons of darkness the Pharisees taught hate the Pharisees
[time=2502] taught hate look what jesus said the sternum mount matthew 543 you have heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy hate those opposed to god hate your enemy whether it's hot or whether
[time=2514] it's cold that's what was taught hate listen now hate was never taught in scripture hate is not
[time=2525] taught in scripture leviticus 19 7 right before the greatest horizontal commandment it says this do not hate your brother in your heart do not hate your brother in your heart in fact the next sentence
[time=2536] talks about being you know honest and open and transparent look what jesus said after he said
[time=2542] this is what you were taught he says but i tell you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be sons of your father in heaven you may reflect his light his heart he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous rain and sun were good things in an agrarian economy those are good things
[time=2562] god is complete in his love for all he asks us to be the same even with the people who are hard to love the hardest guy for me to love after i was i was actually memorizing these verses as part of
[time=2573] the sermon on the mount uh when i when i memorize that um and i and i thought love and pray for my
[time=2580] enemy and i thought about a competitor who ran an auction within a week of mind one time a year and i thought the guy had said quite a few things about me they were untrue i thought he embellished
[time=2591] his own figures which put me in a position should i do the same if i don't then it's going to look like his things a lot bigger uh than our event and and uh you know how do i handle that how do i honor god how do i do all this this is a mess this is hard and so uh i got done praying for uh basically if i look back on it comfort and abundance for me god bless my business do this do that when it came to love and in praying for that guy
[time=2616] i just wanted to say something like uh hope he's a christian okay here we go but i found something
[time=2622] that you might might help you i found that i'm i don't think i'm really doing that the way jesus intends unless i'm praying for that person to be blessed in the exact same way that i wanted to be blessed by god that was really hard for me i mean some of it would be kind of i'm sensitive
[time=2639] anyway and maybe i've appeared i'm sure i appear difficult to him too but um oh i was like coarse
[time=2645] sandpaper on my soul and i happen to encounter him at one of our events in monoray california
[time=2652] i've told you this before out in a courtyard uh in a hotel i had left working out i got my fresh
[time=2658] squeeze orange juice in the toasted bagel and there he is with his beautiful long hair which really made me mad too all right he's about ten years older than i am and i sit down beside him
[time=2668] because he already saw me i'm going to take whatever i'm going to get you know here's going to be something maybe a little bit little jab or something like that now never forget what he said he ran his fingers through his long hair which i wish i had and he said god is with me again today
[time=2684] so i'm really on the spot i have to muster up what's the most spiritual thing i can say here
[time=2690] now look at him i say no way that was a lot funnier than you think it is so go ahead and let
[time=2697] one two go and laugh one two three all right that was really funny but that's really true
[time=2703] it's what i said i found that he had surrendered is he had many addictions and i found that he had surrendered his life to god at an a meeting and that he was a little different than i had perceived
[time=2715] him and he was on a journey oh but i spent a lot of time not loving and praying for the guy
[time=2722] reading what this said and i was convicted by the light i want to ask you today ask yourself this question do i hate a brother do i hate a spouse whether it's cold or hot am i actually not loving self-sacrificially a spouse a relative who's coming over for christmas
[time=2739] a teammate a co-worker a vendor a competitor some social status rich poor pretty ugly
[time=2747] are you not loving some certain groups that some religion ah not catholics not presbyterians not methodists not baptists maybe it's not muslims i'm not going to love the guy if he's a muslim
[time=2761] am i committing selfish acts of disservice either hot or cold to anyone here's the point
[time=2770] if so i've hard my heart toward god i have hard my heart toward god i have to do that in order
[time=2777] to hate or not love somebody else so here's a tool deflect deflect like a shield we need to deflect the difficult behavior and stay engaged like the
[time=2788] lego connected to the heart we need to cut through the surface and all the junk and we need to stay engaged with the heart and to do that we need to deflect the difficult behavior
[time=2800] local proverb says in chapter 17 verse 9 he who covers over in offense promotes love
[time=2807] but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends you remove that lego connection
[time=2813] but if you cover over in offense if you deflect the difficult behavior you're promoting love
[time=2819] love a selfless a selfless act of service versus a selfish act of disservice
[time=2828] so love it's the old and the new command it flows from the heart of god we need to connect with the heart of god we need to connect with the hearts of others in order to let this light shine second we see love is the test for authentic light love is the test for authentic light
[time=2843] and we need to deflect any difficult behavior third what we see is light illuminates relationships
[time=2850] light illuminates relationships both generally the big idea of relationships and both specifically
[time=2856] in each relationship look what it says here in verse john 210 whoever loves his brother lives in the light and there is nothing in him to make him stumble light illuminates relationships with
[time=2868] god light illuminates relationships with others with god lives in the niv or abides in the nesb
[time=2874] lives in the light is meno in greek which refers to us in christ or christ in us us in christ
[time=2881] as well as christ dwelling in us and john used this 67 times in his writings
[time=2887] its evidence of a dominant theme to be in the light to live to abide this living in vibrant
[time=2894] spiritual vitality that takes place with the spirit of christ dwelling in me with myself dwelling in christ and it's also true with others stumbling in to make him stumble is scandal on in greek
[time=2907] which is an imagery for a trap now it's almost always used by new testament writers in the context
[time=2913] of making another stumble so it's probably referring to making another person stumble when we hate we make another person stumble but true light traps no one true light traps no one
[time=2927] when we surrender to the light we reflect his light to others john 812 jesus said it this way i am the light of the world jesus said whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but we'll have the light of life we reflect that light through love selfless acts of service matthew uh five
[time=2946] verses fourteen through sixteen lord jesus said on the storm of the mount you are the light of the world a city on a hill cannot be hidden neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl instead they put it on its stand and give gives light to everyone in the house or what's that light in the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your father in heaven see your deeds of love and see that loving father in heaven
[time=2972] you know with my competitor and our new found relationship we spent that next year kind of loving each other kind of weird
[time=2988] but you can love each other in a competitive environment i'll never forget it was one of the greatest acts of love to me in my business environment that had ever seen uh one year he had his auction after mine and i watched him i can literally see it right now i can see him walking across the campus of our event with what i knew to be a hundred and twenty car titles representing
[time=3009] consignments from his auction to mine i want to never happen prior to that
[time=3017] surely when i happen on my side this is big on what happens when you love people who are difficult
[time=3027] to love the idea that we need to ask ourselves is light illuminating my relationships a relationships
[time=3035] paramount in my life our relationships how i determine success i want to john Maxwell's greatest quotes is the definition of success is those who know me best love and respect me the most
[time=3047] those who know me best love and respect me the most is the light illuminating my relationships
[time=3053] the tool is to reflect like a mirror reflect the heart back we've connected we've uh deflected
[time=3061] with like a shield the difficult behavior and now we're going to reflect the heart back to the person their desires the the intimate connection that we still have we're going to do it in a way that communicates that we've listened and we're going to love we're not going to use it against them we're going to listen and we're going to love we're going to reflect their heart look at Proverbs 27 19 says as water reflects a face so a man's heart reflects a man we have to connect
[time=3084] like a lego to the heart we have to deflect that difficult behavior on the service and then we're that heart's going to reflect who he is and we're going to reflect that back because we've listened to that difficult person the person who's very difficult to love you know you kind of you did
[time=3100] this selfless act of service here because of relationships and you did it last sunday and you
[time=3106] did it into this week really an amazing concept when you think about it um David Mupenda from the
[time=3112] Congo was a church planner and he was up here both services at the conclusion of each service and we knew that he has a relationship with a group of believers here and that he had come over here and he had multiple family members I think maybe seven others children and his wife that he wanted to bring here to America and they had raised $1,200 and they needed I think
[time=3133] $7,800 more well do you know what you did do you know what you did it had to cost you time it had
[time=3139] to cost you talent it had to cost you treasures many of you left your work many of you left your
[time=3145] homes you didn't there was no envelope there was no box you took an effort you sacrificed
[time=3151] self-sacrificially you did an active service of your time talent treasures of your gifts and here's what you did $13,000 now I'm not done somebody said you know what I think I have enough
[time=3165] mileage that you can pay for you can all get all those tickets with my mileage they're work trying to work that out why don't you use the money for his van that is amazing
[time=3175] that is the light being reflected in you yeah you can clap that's the light being reflected in you
[time=3182] love is the old and new command of flows from the heart of God we got to ask ourselves are we
[time=3191] dying to win selfless acts of service are we characterized and known by that do we connect with the heart of God like a Lego and the hearts of others love is the test for authentic light first john two nine if I hate whether it's hot or cold I have hardened my heart to God I need to deflect that difficult behavior and remain engaged with the heart connecting like a Lego
[time=3210] light illuminates relationships will generally and specifically light illuminates relationships they become paramount in my life and then specifically into the person's heart I need to reflect that
[time=3220] light and the heart back to other people in a way that's showing it I understand is light
[time=3226] illuminating my relationships the tool is to reflect like a mirror finally darkness blinds relationships first john two eleven but whoever hates his brothers in the darkness and walks around
[time=3237] in the darkness and he does not know where he's going because darkness has blinded him blinds us with God when we hate another we walk in darkness apart from the indwelling of Christ
[time=3247] in us we have to do a disconnect with God in order to not love somebody even when they're difficult
[time=3253] darkness blinds relationships with other people this darkness blinds us to the hearts and the needs of others 400 years ago a guy said both love and hate are blind both love and hate
[time=3265] are blind love is blind to prejudice and jealousy hate is blind to the hearts and needs of others
[time=3271] love is blind to prejudice and jealousy prejudice is kind of a top-down hate I'm better than you are jealousy is kind of a down up looking up hate you're better than I am hate is blind to the hearts
[time=3286] and needs of others but love is blind to the prejudice and jealousy you know my competitor
[time=3292] I was blind to his heart need I didn't see him as a real person I didn't know about his journey with God I wasn't close enough I didn't connect like a Lego I didn't get I didn't deflect like a shield I didn't reflect his heart like his mirror but when I started to get there things changed
[time=3307] and I'm so glad they did because out of the clear blue literally he came down with a disease
[time=3315] that cost him his life at a very early age and I'm so glad that the light got to enter that
[time=3321] relationship so I can stand here today and teach this and have been able to experience it in just a
[time=3327] little way it doesn't mean I've arrived here's what I want you to do will you move from blindness
[time=3334] to sight by turning from darkness to light will you move from blindness to sight by turning from
[time=3341] darkness to light will you move from blindness to sight by turning from darkness to light will you love your difficult brother will you direct him like a highway sign to the light of Christ
[time=3352] through selfless acts of service will you direct him and in many ways you'll be directed to the light
[time=3358] direct Proverbs 24 11 and 12 and we'll finish rescue those being led away to death hold back
[time=3366] those staggering towards slaughter like a highway sign if you say but we knew nothing about this does not he who weighs the heart perceive it does not he who guards your life know it will he not repage person according to what he has done we are called to direct people even those who are
[time=3382] difficult to love to the light of Christ love is the old and new command am I dying to win is the
[time=3391] true light shining in me am I characterized and known by selfless acts of service to do so I need
[time=3397] to connect like a lego with a heart of God in the heart of others love is the test for authentic light if I hate whether it's hot malicious intent or cold a disregard a dislike I have hardened my
[time=3408] heart toward God I need to deflect that difficult behavior and remain connected to God and the
[time=3414] heart of the other person light illuminates my relationships is the light illuminating my relationships today when that happens I reflect the light of Christ to other people I reflect their
[time=3426] hearts back to them in a way that shows that I listened and I understood darkness blinds relationships move from blindness to sight by turning from darkness to light love my difficult
[time=3437] brother direct him to the light of Christ through selfless acts of service not selfish acts of disservice
[time=3446] please stand and God may it be so may we connect like a lego
[time=3459] deflect like a shield reflect like a mirror and direct like a highway sign
[time=3466] God may the light of who you are shine so brightly in us
[time=3474] that others will see who you are when we love that even when you're good
[time=3481] and Jesus and then
[time=3504] you
