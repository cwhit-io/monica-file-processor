[time=116] [MUSIC]
[time=140] Well, hello again to all of you in the broadcast audience, we're so thankful that you've tuned in again, and let me take this opportunity to say happy new year to you.
[time=149] We're so thankful for what God gave us in 2007, but so looking forward to this relationship
[time=155] and the opportunity that God continues to give us here on the Bible Hour and all that He has for us in 2008, we hope that you'll continue to tune in.
[time=165] I am so grateful for the relationship that God's given us and I am so looking forward to what God has for us in this coming year.
[time=173] I'll tell you what, tonight, speaking of this coming year, right here tonight, January 6, at 5 p.m., at 5 p.m., there is a wonderful opportunity for each and every one of you
[time=185] that I want to just wholeheartedly invite you to come and be a part of.
[time=190] I've had the privilege over the last four years of being a part of and not only having a personal
[time=196] relationship with the Unity Performing Arts Foundation and the Voices of Unity Choir,
[time=203] but I've also had the privilege over the last year of serving on the board of directors for UPAF, and tonight is their annual holiday soulful celebration, and Black Hawk has been
[time=215] privileged to host this over the last three years, and these kids are just phenomenal, and Marshall White and his team, those that give leadership at UPAF and those that give leadership
[time=226] specifically to this Voices of Unity Choir, they have just done a phenomenal job of not only
[time=232] investing musically and vocally into these young people, but personally and spiritually as well.
[time=239] It is going to be an incredible night of music, and I would encourage each and every one of you
[time=245] to bring some friends and come at 5 for what will be a stirring and motivating and exciting
[time=251] night for you. I'm thankful for these young people, between the ages of 8 and 18, they have dedicated
[time=257] themselves in enormous ways, and I can't wait to see what God does through them tonight,
[time=263] and I can't wait for you to come and be a part of this. Don't miss it, 5 p.m. right here in the Worship Center with the Voices of Unity Choir. When the night is deep with the sense of Christmas,
[time=275] an expectancy hangs on every breath heavily. Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[time=283] When the floor is knee deep in discarded wrapping paper, and the new book is already open to page
[time=289] one and the new toys are already broken. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. When the family
[time=297] is squashed, elbow to elbow around the table, and that furious rush for food is over,
[time=303] and the only word that describes that feeling is full. Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[time=312] And when Christmas is over, and the television is silent for the first time in two days,
[time=319] and who sent which Christmas card to whom is forgotten until next year. Behold, I stand at the door,
[time=328] and when the nation has finished celebrating Christmas without Christ, a birthday without a
[time=334] birth, and the coming of a kingdom without a king. Behold, I stand.
[time=364] Worthy is done, never was slain, holy holy is healed.
[time=376] Sing a new song to him who sits on heaven's mercy.
[time=393] That's all sing that verse again.
[time=423] Let's sing holy holy holy.
[time=453] Lord, I everything and I will adore you.
[time=477] Felt in rainbows, all living colors, flashes of lightning, rules of thunder.
[time=492] Let's sing an honor, strength, and glory and power be, to you the only wise king.
[time=505] Yes, holy holy holy is the Lord God of my name, who was in his and his to come.
[time=523] With all creation I sing, praise to the king of thee.
[time=530] You are my everything and I will adore you.
[time=552] Filled with wonder, aw, struck wonder at the mansion of your day.
[time=572] Jesus, your name is power, bread the living water.
[time=586] Holy holy holy is the Lord God of my name, who was in his and his to come.
[time=633] With all creation I sing, praise to the king of thee.
[time=643] You are my everything and I will adore you.
[time=652] Holy holy holy is the Lord God of my name, who was in his.
[time=663] Yes, holy holy holy is the Lord God of my name, who was in his and his to come.
[time=691] We're in the middle of a study on 1 John. We didn't begin this study of 1 John just because
[time=698] we closed our eyes and opened our Bible and did this. We really, really as elders and leaders here,
[time=706] we've given great thought in recent months to what it is we believe God's called us to do and to be
[time=714] about here. I've tried to say this to you on a number of occasions. I'll keep trying to communicate
[time=722] it to you in the days to come while we're thankful for your attendance. Attendors isn't what this is
[time=730] about. This is about our efforts here are to be about helping you grow as followers of Christ
[time=737] as genuine disciples of our Lord. That's the word really if you want to get right down to it.
[time=744] We want you to be and we want to help you become more and more so.
[time=747] Well, I know your dads. I know your moms. I know you're young. I know you're old. I know you're middle. I know there's a lot of different demographics here at work, but as the as the whole,
[time=758] we want nothing more than for you to be followers of Christ. And that is a high calling and it is a
[time=765] huge opportunity for us to try and teach you that and model that for you and help you grasp
[time=772] that and exercise and apply that. And so first John has been a great, great opportunity for it
[time=780] is a phenomenal book that teaches in bold and very clear ways, kind of paints a picture of what it
[time=786] means to love God and to love others. And I'm so thankful that we're in it. We're going to continue
[time=792] to make our way through it over this next month or so and Steve Longbreak. Come on up, Steve.
[time=797] One of our teaching pastors is here this morning and Steve is going to pick us right back up in chapter two of first John. Steve's been a part of our team here at Black Hawk for over 25 years.
[time=808] Several years ago, he left the staff and is part of a ministry foundation here in this area that is
[time=814] deeply involved in all kinds of ministry here and around the world. And Steve is also an elder
[time=820] here at our church and I'm thankful that he's here. Love you. Thanks for being here and welcome Steve.
[time=832] Thanks. You know, when he was up here just now talking, I was sitting there thinking about how
[time=844] much I love him and and how much I feel loved by him. And it's not because he's my pastor. I happen
[time=855] to be in the circle he's been in, the circle of community that he's been in where I've been able
[time=862] to experience the kind of love that when you're in a circle together, where you bump into each
[time=868] other on a regular basis, where you get to experience the kind of love that John's talking
[time=875] about in here. And I just like to encourage you. You know, it doesn't have to be him. A lot of times
[time=884] people get, a lot of people at church get a one-sided relationship with a pastor, especially if it's a big place. And they kind of, their relationship is with that person and they
[time=898] they listen to them and they enjoy them and they love them and they, but that's a one-sided deal unless you happen to be in his circle where you touch, bump into him regularly. He makes a pretty
[time=909] good effort. He loves a lot more people than I do. But I really do. I'm thankful for that.
[time=916] I made a resolution and I want you to hold me accountable
[time=924] on this New Year's resolution. Denny, you'll do a good job of this, I know. I resolve
[time=934] to encourage and hold Nancy accountable to fix the Paula Deen meal once a week.
[time=941] Now, some of you don't know who Paula Deen is. She's the best cook on the food channel. Everything
[time=953] has a lot of butter and a lot of grease and a lot of breading. I mean, it's just, oh man.
[time=962] Nancy's been doing well at that once a year. So I have to get food everywhere else that makes me look like this. And my resolution, my second one, is I resolve if you do that, that I'll be able
[time=973] to button this coat next year at this time. I can't now. But even if you cook that food,
[time=980] I'll button this jacket. Even with this mic pack on.
[time=988] You know, a lot of places, that's kind of what the sermon is today.
[time=992] I have a list of resolutions that somebody thought up.
[time=999] I'm sure glad that I've been able to go to a place where it's not been people's opinions
[time=1008] that have been taught to me, but the words that are in this book and the leading of the spirit.
[time=1015] And so I just hope today that we walk out of here understanding what he wants to renew our minds in,
[time=1024] not my New Year's resolutions.
[time=1028] We've been looking at first John together and just want to review for a minute.
[time=1042] This book is amazing. But this was just going to be.
[time=1047] This one's kind of worn out. So no matter how tight you get it, you'll see I'm going to have
[time=1054] to fight this a little bit. It's okay. Just bear with me. First John, the first chapter,
[time=1062] John says to us and to the people in Turkey that he was writing to those churches,
[time=1070] it's really interesting. Those are the same churches that he wrote to in Revelation, chapter 3, 2 and 3. It's really, really cool when you think that through and look through all that up.
[time=1080] He says to them that he wants them to know the Word. He wants us to know him. Just look at first John
[time=1092] chapter 1 verse 1 for just a minute. It says, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at with our hands,
[time=1103] have touched. This we proclaim concerning the Word of life, the Word of life.
[time=1110] The life appeared. We have seen it and testified to it. We proclaim to you the eternal life which
[time=1116] is which was with the Father and has appeared to us." He says, "We proclaim to you that we have
[time=1124] seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. We write this to make our joy complete." John had seen the Word
[time=1136] of life. He had touched him, the Word of life, the person who is the Word of life.
[time=1148] And he tells us that he wants us, and he wants one of those people in those churches in Turkey.
[time=1154] He wants us to experience complete joy.
[time=1160] And if you think about who he is, the person of Christ throughout this message, if you yourself
[time=1172] think about who he is and how he is weaved through this passage that we're going to look at,
[time=1183] you're going to get something from that that will be incredibly yours. A friend of mine, Harlan, he helped me think that through this week about how important it is to look at what
[time=1193] the passage is saying about Christ and who he is because that's what this book is about.
[time=1198] So think about how you relate to him in a specific way, you yourself, not the points I bring up,
[time=1206] how you relate to him in a specific way because of what he teaches us here in 1 John,
[time=1214] chapter 2, verses 12 through 14. Now, we've reviewed, I mean, we've been looking at 1 John,
[time=1221] and there's some pressure in 1 John. I've never really liked it a lot.
[time=1228] I always like to have other people read it, let them squirm too, but I haven't really always
[time=1234] enjoyed that. 1 John makes you nervous because he says you will know that you know him. What?
[time=1240] In those first passages, if you walk in light, if you're obedient, if you walk as he walks,
[time=1250] I mean, come on. So every time I've ever read that I think, that ain't me.
[time=1256] But in the middle of that pressure, there's going to be some pressure next time, next week,
[time=1266] these do not love the world or anything in the world. If you love the world, you don't know him.
[time=1272] That's what it says. That's some more pressure. But this week, we get some relief.
[time=1276] This week, it's just about enjoying our adoption, enjoying life in Christ. This week,
[time=1290] these three verses, 12th, we get to just embrace what God gives us in adoption and enjoy fatherhood
[time=1299] and thinking about eternity rather than these temporal things and enjoying the power that we
[time=1306] have. So I titled this, I'm not really good at titles, but when I read this passage, I titled it
[time=1312] forgiven and empowered forever. If that's not encouragement, I don't know what it is. If that's
[time=1321] true today, if you walk out of here, really knowing you're forgiven in Christ, you're empowered by
[time=1328] him, and that's forever. You ought to be changed, and so should I. When Kelly first told me a few
[time=1338] weeks ago that we were going to be here at this point when it was my turn to come up, I've looked at this passage a lot in the past, and I always wonder, man, what in the world is that doing in the middle of 1 John? I don't get it. It looks like poetry, especially the way the NIV
[time=1352] translators put it in there. But it looks like poetry, and it doesn't seem to fit. It sort of
[time=1358] seems like John just said, oh, by the way, let me tell you about this too, and then we'll go back to what I was saying. It's not that at all. This particular nugget of this passage right here,
[time=1369] if we really, really understand what he does here, we'll be able to embrace the challenges that the
[time=1378] rest of the book brings and embrace the teaching that we need to watch out for those false teachers.
[time=1386] So I encourage you to just really take this personally this morning. I'll try to help you go there.
[time=1392] When Mitchell preached a couple weeks ago, he reviewed some verses beforehand, and in 1 John 5
[time=1407] it says, we can know him. Our claims about who we are will be matched by our walk. That's what it says
[time=1418] there. It says that our walk will be his walk. His walk will be our walk. And then Mitchell said
[time=1428] that in the passage preceding these poetic verses that we're going to look at this morning, he said, remember he had those X, there were four X, E-C-T words that end with E-C-T's,
[time=1441] he's trying to be a poet. And the first one, he says, we need to connect, remember, to the light
[time=1448] source, like Legos connect, and he gave us that little visual image. And then he said, we need to
[time=1456] deflect, and I like that, deflect, deflect away the darts of temptation and doubt. And there's a shield
[time=1467] of faith in Ephesians that we have to deflect away the darts of the evil one. And I also like the
[time=1477] fact that shield, he talked about a mirror, and I kind of pictured that shield as the mirror also, because we're also to reflect, he said, like a mirror, the light of God.
[time=1489] Then the last one, he said, we need to direct, and I want to quote him on this one, direct
[time=1495] like a highway sign, he said. Selfless acts of service that lead one to seeing
[time=1510] the heart of Christ at work. If my acts of service are about you seeing me,
[time=1516] really, really meaningless, even dangerous, not just meaningless, even dangerous.
[time=1524] But if acts of service cause someone to see Christ, well, there's power in that.
[time=1535] And that leads us to today. So let's look at 1 John. Stand with me, would you please?
[time=1540] We'll read 1 John chapter 2 verses 12 through 14. It says, I write to you, dear children.
[time=1550] Dear children there, that's not talking about kids.
[time=1561] That particular word could be described this way, could be born ones. Anybody
[time=1569] to hear, not a born one? It's even better yet if you think about it in these terms.
[time=1574] Born again ones. That's who he's writing to. Dear children, born again ones. It's not about
[time=1583] your age here. It's about who your father is. It's about adoption.
[time=1592] I write to you, dear children, he says, to all those people that are filling the heat from that
[time=1600] letter. He says, I want you to remember, you're the dear ones. You're the chosen ones.
[time=1606] You're the born again ones. You're born into a different family, an eternal one.
[time=1611] I write to you, dear children, he says, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
[time=1620] I write to you, father, he says. Now, this one is about some age.
[time=1629] This is about some maturity. This may be spiritual maturity, but there's an element of age in this
[time=1635] as well. He says, I write to you, fathers. You, you older ones. You more mature ones. You,
[time=1641] you that are, that are able to, because you have known him who is from the beginning.
[time=1646] I write to you young men. That word could really be translated young ones because it's really not
[time=1654] gender specific. Because you have overcome the evil one.
[time=1663] I write to you, dear children. This one is about age and maturity. This isn't the same word that's
[time=1669] translated, dear children, in verse 12. This word is about maturity. He says, I write to you, dear
[time=1675] children. You less mature ones. You new ones into the family. You that are chosen by God,
[time=1681] redeemed by him, and you've just realized it recently. I write to you, you, dear children, because you've known the father. The fatherhood of God is what dominates your thinking.
[time=1692] Next, I write to you, fathers again, because you have known him who is from the beginning, not an accident that it's word for word, the same thing he said previously to fathers.
[time=1702] I write to you young men because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you,
[time=1710] and you have overcome the evil one. God, please help us. Help us to understand what it is you want us
[time=1720] to know and who you want us to be because we read this and we get our minds renewed.
[time=1729] Please help us. In the mighty name of Jesus, I ask it. Amen. You may be seated.
[time=1739] Well, I mentioned that this was poetic. I told my sister I might call her up here because
[time=1746] when I mentioned Onomatopoeia, you know, I don't really know what I'm talking about, but she does.
[time=1750] She was an English teacher for 30 years, and she was written a lot of poetry, and I haven't.
[time=1756] I wrote a little. It was real bad. But this passage of Scripture, 12 through 14,
[time=1763] it's tucked in the middle here, and it really does look different than the rest of it. It's not really the Hebrew form of poetry that you see in the Old Testament, or they could just say it's poetry.
[time=1775] It's not really the Greek form of poetry that would have been typical of that day, but there's something rhythmic about this. There's something unusual about the way it's structured, and so poetry, really, the Greek translation of that word really is just about creating.
[time=1789] That's why I used to love this when they'd say an athlete was poetic. That's not the only time I
[time=1797] ever was poetic, and I love it when they show slow motion athletes. I wish they'd had that when I
[time=1804] played. The slow motion that they had when I played was what it looked like when it was on fast
[time=1811] motion. It was just like that. But it says this poetry, there's not the stuff that we're used to,
[time=1821] the resonance, or the alliteration, or the onomatopoeia. I love to say that. I sound like I know what
[time=1827] I'm talking about. You don't see repeated vowels or consonants. You don't see repeated sounds,
[time=1839] but there's something here that makes you say, "Oh, this is different."
[time=1845] And so the more I studied it, the more I fell in love with these three verses.
[time=1853] John the Fisherman wrote this. It says, "I write to you, fathers,
[time=1864] because you have known him who is from the beginning." I don't know about you, but that's powerful for me today. Well, let's back up to verse 12 now.
[time=1884] "I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name."
[time=1890] Now, you're the dear children.
[time=1894] We are those. Those of us who have come to believe that Christ died for our sins.
[time=1903] We can enjoy the fact that that was done in his name. And it's really important for us to
[time=1913] realize that it was not done by any of us. Your forgiveness has nothing to do with your behavior.
[time=1924] Your forgiveness has everything to do with his behavior.
[time=1934] He chose obedience to the Father and went to the cross, separated from the Father by sin
[time=1944] so that I could read this verse and know it's true. I'm forgiven.
[time=1952] Because of his name, that his namesake, name has to do with everything about a person when this
[time=1963] was written, their whole being. It's their whole reputation. It's what they look like, what they
[time=1972] sound like, who they are, what people think of when they're away, what they really do, what they mean to do, what they don't mean to do. It's the whole, and his name, he was able, because of
[time=1983] everything he is to die on a cross, and my sins are forgiven because he did that.
[time=1991] Dear children, if you really believe that, it says that if you believe in your heart
[time=1999] and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved. If you believe that,
[time=2005] you can walk out of here this morning and enjoy this whole passage in a way that you could never
[time=2012] have enjoyed that without knowing him. He paid the penalty for your sin. Your sins are forgiven
[time=2021] on account of his name. Are you enjoying that this morning?
[time=2026] I am, because I know me. I know me. Sin means missing the mark.
[time=2039] The mark, perfect holiness. That's how you get to be with perfect holiness. You get to be with
[time=2048] perfect holiness if you're perfectly holy. And I'm not, but for his name's sake, I was forgiven.
[time=2065] The Father forgives me through the blood of Christ. And we can enjoy that this morning.
[time=2074] Well, then it says in verse 13, "I write to you, fathers, because you've known him who was from
[time=2086] the beginning." And again, I told you that's repeated later. I write to you, fathers.
[time=2093] Now, understand, when he says fathers, there's an age element to this. There's a maturity element
[time=2100] to this. There's probably a spiritual significance to the words that he's choosing here. But I really
[time=2106] believe that in some way, these words apply to each of us. Because honestly, in some areas of each
[time=2118] of our lives, some people are mature. They stopped doing this one or started doing this immediately.
[time=2125] And I used to tell my government students this. I'd ask this question at the beginning of each year,
[time=2133] some of them might even remember that in here when you hear it this morning. I would say,
[time=2139] "Are you a liberal or a conservative?" And if they answered that, I'd say, "That's okay today,
[time=2148] but if you ever tell me that you're a liberal or conservative again, I'm going to fail you." And that usually got their attention because I really could fail. I was allowed to do that.
[time=2157] I said, "When somebody asks you if you're a liberal or a conservative,
[time=2164] you should..." Does anybody in here know the answer? What should happen? Speak up, really.
[time=2169] What should you... What? That's a good answer. Because the real answer to that is a question.
[time=2182] It's a question. If you ask me if I'm a liberal or a conservative, I'm going to ask you on what
[time=2188] issue some people in our culture would call me extremely liberal on this issue. And some would
[time=2196] call me extremely conservative on this issue. Are you liberal or are you conservative? Well,
[time=2207] this passage says, "You have known because you have known him who is from the beginning."
[time=2217] I'm not forgiven because I've done something this or that. And I'm not mature. I'm not this
[time=2225] mature father that I'm talking about unless I really have come to grips with and understand
[time=2232] the significance of him in me overcoming something or empowering me to do something.
[time=2243] So our maturity, you can all be called father if you have experienced
[time=2250] the reality of a mature decision that led to maturity over something. Now, some are more mature
[time=2257] over more things than others. And there is an age element here. The age element, I just want
[time=2264] to kind of encourage you. For me, the last, I'd say, 10 years. I've been thinking about eternity more
[time=2276] and kind of embracing the reality of eternity who was from the beginning.
[time=2286] You see, I'm not eternal. Now, I have an eternal future,
[time=2295] but I don't have an eternal past. He's the only one. He was from... And he says you people that are
[time=2307] able, that are mature enough, that are the fathers, embrace the fact that you've known him who's from the beginning. John has told us that before. He says the creator in verse... Let's go back...
[time=2333] Well, let's go to John 1 first. I'm sorry, I'm taking these out of order, Katie. John 1
[time=2340] says through him all things were made without him referring to Christ. Nothing was made that has
[time=2350] been made. Him who was from the beginning, I told you before to make sure you think about Christ in
[time=2356] this passage. Jesus is from the beginning. He spoke the creation into existence. John 1 tells us that.
[time=2368] Genesis 1 tells us that. Genesis 1 says, let us make man in our image.
[time=2373] And every time God made something, he said it into existence. I just love the fact that Jesus
[time=2382] has called the Word all the time. And he also was the creator. Look at Colossians chapter 1.
[time=2392] Colossians 1, did I not give you that when I didn't give you that when I'll just quote it,
[time=2399] quote it. Colossians 1 says, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation,
[time=2406] for by him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible.
[time=2411] Whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, all things were created by him and for him,
[time=2417] and in him all things hold together. Jesus is talking about he is the image of the invisible God. He is the creator. If you know him who is from the beginning, then you can enjoy the maturity that you're experiencing and you can enjoy the future that
[time=2438] you're looking forward to. And the older I get, the more important that future is to me
[time=2445] and the less important this future is to me as far as what I'm going to get from it.
[time=2451] Now the future here is important to me because of what I'm going to have a chance to give and
[time=2457] I realize the urgency that I'm running out of time. Matter of fact, I hit a rabbit this morning.
[time=2464] I saw a lot of frowns and moans like bunnies. It's okay if you hit a bird or something, but
[time=2472] people don't like it when you hit bunnies. No, I hit this, all my life, I've wanted to be a macho guy that didn't mind hitting animals because I kind of thought that's what, you know, I grew up hunting. I never liked it. I loved going out. I loved being with the guys. I like that. I just didn't like to kill anything. And when I hit that rabbit today though, it caused me, I saw it come
[time=2494] out. I started to move. I heard my dad's voice hit the rabbit. I hit a deer last year and really
[time=2508] messed my car up and this guy that was with me said, "You tried to hit that deer." I said, "You're right." He said, "Why'd you do that?" I said, "Because my dad drilled it into us, hit every animal.
[time=2521] Don't hit a tree." And he said it over and over again. Hit every animal. Don't swerve to miss an
[time=2530] animal. Hit a ditch or a tree. So I aim at them when they're out there on the road.
[time=2536] But I don't like it. I hope dad's proud of me for that.
[time=2546] Fathers, there's an urgency because it is temporary. I thought about how quick that little rabbit
[time=2556] was here and gone. He's gone forever. But we aren't. But there's still an urgency that I feel when I
[time=2566] realize the temporary reality of my future here. But the joy that I get in thinking about my future
[time=2574] there. And that's what he wants you to walk out of here with this morning. Can you embrace
[time=2580] in your maturity? In your maturity, can you embrace the eternal reality of him who is from the beginning?
[time=2589] He's forever. He's the I am then. He's the I am now. He'll be the I am forever. I am is present tense
[time=2600] because it's eternal. That's his name. He is. I wasn't.
[time=2607] Then he goes on and he says, "I write to you young men because you have overcome the evil one."
[time=2622] There's a lot there. The evil one. That could really be translated
[time=2636] the evil and it'd be right. He is Satan, all of his demons, the spiritual forces of darkness,
[time=2648] Bible calls him. They are evil and evilness is wrapped up in what they want to accomplish.
[time=2656] But evil and them is this word. Anything wicked and them. Anything evil and them is this word.
[time=2667] And you could really write it capital T-H-E-E-V-I-L, the evil. It's the same word that Jesus used in
[time=2676] Matthew chapter 6. In Matthew 6 when he taught people how to pray, you remember what he said?
[time=2682] Deliver us from the evil one. It's the very same word. All of evil.
[time=2689] Young men, all of us are the young men too, but some of you really understand this. Young men,
[time=2699] we're the ones that are empowered to Nike. That's what that Greek word is, that overcome word.
[time=2705] It's a warrior word. It means I can overcome with the power. I can demolish my adversary.
[time=2715] Why? Why can't I? Because I'm one of his children. I'm his child. He's in me.
[time=2731] So he wants us to enjoy the power that we have in Christ to overcome the evil. We do not
[time=2738] have to give in to the temptations that tempt us. Whether it's to do bad or to not do good,
[time=2745] we don't have to cave into that. We, the young men, are empowered by Christ to overcome the evil.
[time=2757] Then he says, I write to you dear children again. This time, he says a different word.
[time=2764] Like I told you before, it's really about a young child or a child or an immature person.
[time=2769] Because you have known, and here again, he goes, the father. Because you've known the father.
[time=2775] Tonight, today, all day tomorrow, you can enjoy the reality that you're adopted.
[time=2783] You've been chosen. I'll never forget. I was interviewing a family that wanted to come to the school here, and there were three kids. And the first two were coming into the school. The third
[time=2794] one wasn't quite old enough. And I interviewed the family. Man, they were incredible. I really loved them. They loved the Lord. They couldn't wait to be in a Christmas. They were just excited to be at church. And I got to the third one, and I wasn't really interviewing her because she was
[time=2809] yet kindergarten age, even. And I said, well, tell me a little bit about you, Kimberly.
[time=2813] And she said this, I'm special. I said, you are? She said, yes. I said, how are you so special?
[time=2823] This is precious little girl. She says, they had Greg and Christina, but they adopted me.
[time=2832] How do you think they'd done at making her feel special? They chose me, she said. You know what?
[time=2843] This morning, he's chosen you. You're his child.
[time=2857] He's adopted you, dear children. And in the middle of this book, John wants us to embrace that,
[time=2866] receive that, and enjoy that. I feel loved.
[time=2872] Have you known the Father? He says, dear children, that I'm writing to, you've known the Father.
[time=2888] And Nancy and I were in Africa a couple weeks ago, and we were with this guy that was later,
[time=2899] I found out this guy's a big shot. I think I looked it up on the Internet. His name showed up,
[time=2906] but how many times? I think it was like 100,000 times on Yahoo. And Google said it was 43,000 times.
[time=2913] I mean, I think I'm one there twice. And he was with us, and he was adopted.
[time=2921] He and his sister were six months old in England when their mother gave them up for adoption.
[time=2932] They were twins. And I guess that was pretty obvious, wasn't it? Six months old sister.
[time=2941] They were twins, and the guy that adopted them was a good friend of C.S. Lewis is a met with him every week talking to him. You know the guys.
[time=2952] I'm going, you got to be kidding me. He goes, no. He says,
[time=2958] the man that chose to adopt me was one of C.S. Lewis's best friends. Can you imagine that I got
[time=2967] to be raised in that environment instead of where I could have been raised adopted?
[time=2975] He also had incredible insights. He said to Nancy, he could tell that she was fatherless.
[time=2983] Didn't have a dad. Nancy's dad died when she was in the womb. This guy sensed that. He's so
[time=2990] sensitive to that that he really could say, he gave her a book he'd written on it. And he also
[time=2996] sensed that I'd had a good dad. He said, there's something about the guys that are around that have good dads. He said, but guess what? To me, you need a father too. You know how good good dads are?
[time=3011] They're about this good. Good really, really good dads are bad.
[time=3019] Really, really good dads are still selfish. Really, really good dads teach us some things that seem
[time=3027] to be good because they align with maybe what our culture says is good, but they aren't necessarily God's way of doing it. We need adopted by a father who renews us, renews our thinking with the truth
[time=3041] so that we can be this warrior to overcome the evil one. And we can embrace as dear children
[time=3049] knowing the father. You know who my father is? I have a dad. When I read Jesus' statements in
[time=3058] Matthew 6 about not calling the guy on earth that was your dad father, I quit doing that.
[time=3064] Now, don't worry, it's not a really, I don't think that's any big deal, but I started calling my dad dad all the time to everybody because I only have one father. And he has adopted me into the
[time=3075] same family into which he adopted you. And what John wants us to experience is relationship with
[time=3082] him through the son and with each other that's like what it's going to be there. That's what first John's about. Man, oh man. I'm so thankful. I know the father.
[time=3096] And then he says, I write to you, this is the last verse now, 14, I write to you fathers because
[time=3105] you've known him who was from the beginning, I write to you young men because you are strong and the Word of God lives in you and you have overcome the evil one. It says it over again.
[time=3115] But this time he adds a little something and the Word of God lives in you because you are strong.
[time=3119] Why are you strong? Why are you strong young people, maturing people in Christ? Why are you strong?
[time=3128] You're strong to the extent that the Word lives in you. I can't emphasize enough how important it is
[time=3136] for you to renew your thinking with his words. Our strength is directly proportional to a renewed mind
[time=3146] in the ability to overcome. I know a family. I know a family in Uganda.
[time=3162] Jones and Gertrude are the parents names, their fathers. They are really eternally minded.
[time=3172] They really get this. They have about 10 people that live with them. I don't know how many of them
[time=3180] are really their kids and how many are adopted and how many just live there. But they always have people in and they work actually at an orphanage that our foundation partners with.
[time=3190] And Jones and Gertrude are incredibly mature and powerful. They've been through the overcoming
[time=3197] young man stage. They have some children that are in the middle of the overcoming young man stage
[time=3206] and they're flip-flopping around sometimes. I've watched in their family. They have this little baby joy.
[time=3213] I may have told you about her once. I don't know. I've talked about her so many times because I'm amazed at this story. She's about four. She's going to be four. And when she was born,
[time=3226] her mother, I don't know why. I'm not going to guess why. But her mother threw her in a pit
[time=3237] to discard her or to save her from life with her. I don't know what was going on there.
[time=3246] But she was seen. And in this pit, which was a pit, it was a latrine,
[time=3252] in this pit somebody saw her throw her in so they were able to get some people and get this little
[time=3260] baby umbilical cord still attached. And because of the conditions in that pit, warm, soft,
[time=3271] the baby landed just right. The baby was fine. And it was fairly deep. He said he told me it took
[time=3279] them a couple hours to get her out. It just seems impossible to me. The mom went to prison.
[time=3287] The baby went to the baby house at the orphanage where we get to work a little bit.
[time=3297] And Jones and Gertrude's kids, the middle girls, go to the baby house every week and hold babies.
[time=3305] The baby house has kids that are there for all kinds of reasons, but they're babies.
[time=3310] Well, they brought Joy home, talked Jones into letting her visit one day, which was, he knew it was a big mistake. He already had all these kids. Life's not easy there.
[time=3323] Well, now he has Joy and we've watched her grow up and she is a Joy.
[time=3332] She has been adopted into this family that nurtures her.
[time=3341] They took Joy to see her mother in prison against the girls and the mom's wishes.
[time=3352] And they led her to Christ. And they've been back several times and now they've said, "When you get out, we want you to come live with us until you're able to be on your feet and take care of your daughter." Now, Jones is not popular in his house for doing this. The girls aren't excited
[time=3369] about Joy leaving. And we don't know what'll happen, but I just want to tell you, I've watched
[time=3376] Joy experience the fatherhood of Jones and Gertrude. I don't know that she knows Christ yet,
[time=3383] but she is flourishing and so should we be adopted by the King of Kings,
[time=3398] the father of the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, a joint heir in his family. If you can't
[time=3407] walk out of here this morning, encouraged about that, then you don't know him. And you just need
[time=3416] to put your trust in the fact that the Father has chosen to adopt us through the blood of Christ,
[time=3423] being paid for our sins. And then you can't experience that joy.
[time=3429] I'm forgiven through the blood of Christ. I'm empowered by Christ Himself. I can overcome the evil.
[time=3448] And it's forever. It's forever. Lord, please help us to know that
[time=3460] and to honor you because of it. Thank you, Lord, for the encouragement that this passage is.
[time=3471] Thank you so much. In the name of Christ, through the blood of Christ,
[time=3479] empowered by Christ, we pray these things. Amen.
