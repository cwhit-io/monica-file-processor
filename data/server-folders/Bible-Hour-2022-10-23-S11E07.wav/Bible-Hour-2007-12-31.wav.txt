[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=8] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=15] [MUSIC]
[time=20] Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=28] [MUSIC]
[time=36] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=43] [MUSIC]
[time=47] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=50] [MUSIC]
[time=59] And we proclaim, you are the music of God.
[time=67] [MUSIC]
[time=69] You describe the goal, uncontainable, who plays the stars in the sky, and you know them by then.
[time=79] You are the music of God.
[time=84] You come above, incomparable, unchangeable.
[time=90] You see the depths of my heart, and you are neither safe.
[time=96] You are the music of God.
[time=100] [MUSIC]
[time=112] Well hello again everybody, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=115] We are so thankful that you've joined us, and so looking forward to what you're going to be able to take in and experience today.
[time=121] Of all the ministries that Blackhawk has had the privilege of being a part of over its 35 to 40 years span,
[time=129] you know one of the most exciting ministries, and one that I'm maybe most thankful for today for some obvious reasons, is our school.
[time=137] Not only are my five kids a part of it, and not only do they benefit each and every day from the godly and loving and biblical investment that they receive from those who lead at our school,
[time=149] but our school has had the privilege of impacting hundreds, probably thousands of kids in their families over the years.
[time=156] It is an amazing thing to be a part of, and I am so grateful for those who years and years ago had a vision,
[time=163] a vision for a Christian school that would make a difference in the lives of those in our community.
[time=168] And while I'm thankful for those who have gone before us, I'm really, really excited, and so grateful for those who today give themselves to our little ones and our middle school kids and our high school kids.
[time=180] It's an incredible team, and today we have the privilege of having one of our team members with us,
[time=186] Stephen Webster. Steve has become a friend, and Steve is also a part of our high school faculty.
[time=191] You're going to actually hear from Steve this morning in our worship service as he comes to teach, and I just ask Steve if he'd come today and share with you maybe what's in his heart as it relates to the privilege
[time=203] that he has each and every day of teaching Bible to our high school kids.
[time=207] I know sometimes high school kids and Bible, some folks don't think that goes, but I'll tell you what, Steve has given himself completely to that endeavor, and I know from firsthand experience and from talking to our students how much they enjoy being a part of Steve's classes,
[time=224] and so Steve, would you just share with the folks kind of your heart for teaching Bible to high school kids and what that's been like for you over the years?
[time=232] It is indeed a privilege, Kelly. I found that at Blackhawk teaching Bible and high school students are a very good marriage.
[time=240] Why teaching Bible is such a privilege for me is first and foremost because what the Bible says about itself,
[time=246] the Bible proclaims itself to be the word of God, to be God's very own word, and so if that's the case,
[time=252] and we believe very much that it is, then its imperatives are for all people, for teachers, for students, for each one of us.
[time=259] So teaching with urgency, with passion, with relevance is not an option.
[time=265] There isn't a certain urgency about that mission that I feel.
[time=268] I've always felt that way I've been teaching the Bible for over ten years, the youth groups and high schools,
[time=274] and now at the college level a little bit. It's a great joy, a great pleasure to do it.
[time=278] I can't think of anything else I'd rather do. I heard Jeff Koach, one of our co-workers recently read from the Gospel of Luke, when someone commended the servants of Jesus for doing what they were told to do, so I'm just a bondservant.
[time=290] I did my duty. That's my response to when people say, "Thank you for teaching the Bible, Steve."
[time=296] I say, "Well, I'm just a bondservant. I've done my duty. I've done what God has called me to do in this place." I find it a great pleasure, a great privilege indeed.
[time=305] That's awesome.
[time=306] I know how much they enjoy it. If you're around Blackhawk at all, you know that so many of our students, our faculty,
[time=313] even parents are so grateful for Steve and others on our team, who every single day make not only an academic
[time=321] and biblical investment, but a personal investment as well.
[time=325] It's one of the great, unique qualities of our school.
[time=328] People like Steve and who are willing to come alongside, and while investing truth and knowledge as it relates to the Bible
[time=335] or chemistry or English, these guys are ready and willing to invest personally into the lives and futures of our students.
[time=344] I'm so thankful you've tuned in today. I can't wait for you to hear what God has put on Steve's heart today,
[time=350] and we're thankful that you tuned in. Again, so grateful for the relationship that God's given us with you.
[time=356] God bless you. We hope you have a great, great week. Keep praying for us, and we hope to see you soon.
[time=362] We have a four-year-old artist, ballet dancer, philosopher living in our house named Hannah.
[time=374] Here's some of her artwork as you might want to check that out. This is very inspirational to me.
[time=379] It's a rainbow. It's a picture of God's promise. It's a hopeful image for the new year.
[time=385] It's inspiring. Maybe it causes you to have awe. You know, the A-W-W-W-W kind of awe, not the A-W-S, thank you for that.
[time=396] This morning, I want to invite you to begin to consider God's and his delightfulness, his awesomeness.
[time=404] This image from Hannah is a picture of that. She's our resident philosopher. Recently, she opened her Bible to give me a Bible lesson.
[time=412] And so I have my computer out. I was ready to type. This is going to be great, you know.
[time=416] So you talked about heaven last year, Kelly, here at Black Hawk Ministries. Is that correct?
[time=421] And Hannah says that the heavens are flowers and balloon. Not balloons, but balloon.
[time=429] The heavens are flowers and balloon. That's her little philosophical take on heaven. So that was helpful to me.
[time=436] Here's Hannah's image. This is an image from Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel in the ceiling. It's one picture among thousands.
[time=445] This is out there for you. This morning is an introduction to God in all of his delightfulness. God delights in things, but God is also delightful in himself.
[time=456] And this picture for you is just an image. There are books in the foyer by John Piper. Don't waste your life.
[time=463] Leave this place. Buy that book. Read it this week. It's a fast read. You will not regret it.
[time=469] This is an invitation this morning for you to consider how great God is.
[time=474] Hannah's rainbow is the beginning of that. The Sistine Chapel is the end game for you.
[time=481] That's only one image among just thousands and thousands of squares of God's goodness. I couldn't say any better than that.
[time=491] The reason why I'm here this morning is because Kelly was in my class last semester. That was last semester.
[time=497] Last year, now hard even to imagine that. And we're talking about why God is not an ego test.
[time=503] You probably never asked yourself that question. It's got an ego test. It's almost an insulting question, but there are people who ask that question all the time.
[time=511] Tim Tebow won the Heisman Trophy last year. You guys know who Tim Tebow is? Quarterback University of Florida.
[time=517] Recently dispatched by my Michigan Wolverines. I'm happy to say.
[time=522] Tim Tebow was responsible this year. There he is before you handsome young man.
[time=526] Follower of Christ. Missionary work with his parents. Great guy. Tim Tebow was responsible for 51 touchdowns this year.
[time=534] That's an awful lot of touchdowns. 51 touchdowns. Some of them passing. Some of them running. Very impressive.
[time=540] He got an award. The Heisman Trophy award for excellence. The most excellent football athlete in college this past year.
[time=546] Probably don't know this guy. Kelly is a big fan of this guy. He told me last hour.
[time=551] Hyman Bass. University of Michigan pure mathematics professor. Kelly's. Yes, he was excited about him.
[time=559] He's made a career out of algebra. Isn't this not exciting? Students. An algebra as a career. Wow.
[time=567] He's a pure mathematics professor. I don't know what that means, but I'm sure it's pretty cool.
[time=572] Pure mathematics. He's receiving his national Medal of Science Laureate from President Bush last summer.
[time=579] He came to the White House, got his award, and back to Ann Arbor.
[time=584] It was not inappropriate for him to do so. John Piper wrote a book last year called What Jesus Demands from the World. He went away for a semester on a sabbatical.
[time=595] He chased down everything Jesus asks the world to do. We're going to book about it. Incredible.
[time=601] It won the Gold medallion award last year for Christian life. What Jesus Demands you won an award for it.
[time=606] I doubt that John Piper refused to have the sticker put on the cover of his book. It was a good book he was recognized for it.
[time=613] I say all of those things to ask you this question.
[time=616] If Tim Tebow and Hyman Bass and John Piper are rightly worthy of recognition, of praise, of honor, very publicly, very prominently,
[time=627] how much more is our indescribable God worthy of that glory?
[time=634] How much more ridiculous could it be to accuse that God of being an egotist?
[time=638] But Richard Dawkins and his cronies asked these questions. Richard Dawkins wrote a very famous book last year,
[time=645] which I hope you have not read, called The God Delusion. This is a quote from it.
[time=651] There's one correct word in this quote, and I'll share that with you in just a minute.
[time=654] The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction.
[time=659] Jealous and proud of it, a petty, unjust, unforgiving, control freak, a vindictive, bloodthirsty, ethnic cleanser,
[time=668] a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, philicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal,
[time=674] setomasticistic, capriciously, malevolent, bully.
[time=680] That's Richard Dawkins' picture of God. This one white word in that quote, it's arguably.
[time=686] I will argue against that quote this morning that Richard Dawkins is arguably quite wrong.
[time=692] To accuse God of being an egotist is itself egotistical.
[time=698] To accuse God of being malevolent is to be malevolent yourself.
[time=702] We'll come back that in just a few minutes.
[time=705] The Westminster shorter catechism is a series of 107 questions.
[time=710] The first one is this question. It's a great question.
[time=713] What is the chief end of man? What is the purpose of life?
[time=718] I couldn't have asked a better question than that.
[time=721] The answer? The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.
[time=728] That's the purpose of life, 1647, the Westminster shorter catechism.
[time=732] I think it's a wonderful answer to that question.
[time=734] My life's purpose is to give God glory, but Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens would have me believe
[time=741] that giving God glory is just to feed God's ego.
[time=746] And I'm flabbergasted. And so yes, I'll take his invitation.
[time=749] I'll argue against that this morning from Isaiah chapter 42.
[time=752] If you have your Bibles, I would invite you to go there.
[time=756] Isaiah 42, I will apologize ahead of time for the meanness, the brief, the brevity of our talk this morning. There is so much more here.
[time=764] Again, the Sistine Chapel image, let it be ingrained in your mind that I invite you to chase these things down.
[time=770] A few words on Isaiah before we begin.
[time=772] Isaiah is writing 700 years before Christ is born.
[time=775] He is writing according to the first verse to Judah and Jerusalem.
[time=779] Judah and Jerusalem, at the time that Isaiah is receiving this vision from God, the special insight from God, they are complacent.
[time=788] They are economically prosperous, but spiritually bankrupt.
[time=793] They not only ignore the poor, but they abuse the poor.
[time=796] They trample over them. They victimize them. The spoil of the poor is in their houses.
[time=802] It says in Isaiah chapter 3, it's a very, very bleak picture.
[time=808] As a prophet, he functions as God's mouthpiece, but so prophets are.
[time=813] They don't just tell the future. People hear the word prophecy think, well, God's just telling the future, which he certainly does.
[time=819] But what prophets do in the scriptures is they function as the mouthpiece of God.
[time=823] They afflict the comfortable, and they comfort the afflicted.
[time=828] This morning, as you hear from God's word, that will happen to you.
[time=831] Not because of me, but because of what the scriptures say.
[time=834] If you are comfortable this morning in a negative sense, then God will speak to you in that regard to move you out of your comfort.
[time=840] If you are afflicted this morning, there is good news.
[time=844] Listen to what God says about himself. The scriptures were given to us as divine self-revelation.
[time=850] That God would disclose to his people, to people everywhere, what he is like.
[time=855] Because God wants to be known, God wants to be found out.
[time=859] This morning, he will tell you his name. This is my name.
[time=862] This is who I am. That's how Kelly introduced me this morning.
[time=865] He told you my name, and it was an air call.
[time=870] That's my invitation to you this morning.
[time=872] We see glimpses of comfort in Isaiah chapters 1 through 39.
[time=876] It's there. You can see it.
[time=879] Isaiah 7, Isaiah chapter 9, the birth of Christ, wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace, Isaiah 11, and the promise of the Spirit being given to God's servant.
[time=892] It's there. It's pretty hard to find, but it's there.
[time=894] It's a pretty bleak picture in the first half of Isaiah.
[time=897] The second half of Isaiah is overwhelming with its rapturous beauty and its words.
[time=903] The first two words of Isaiah 40 are comfort.
[time=908] Be very comforted. There is no way in the Hebrew to express superlatives. We say good better best.
[time=916] They say holy, holy, holy. He is the most holy.
[time=920] Comfort means be very comforted. Be quite comforted.
[time=924] What's the good news of Isaiah 40 and 41?
[time=926] Maybe you're asking that question. This is a very short list.
[time=929] Here we go. 40 verse 2, if you want to look at these verses, that's fine. I'm just going to go very quickly through before we get to our text this morning.
[time=937] Jerusalem's warfare is over. 40 verse 2.
[time=940] Every valley lifted up, every mountain made low.
[time=945] Every obstacle has been removed.
[time=947] When Paul is imprisoned in Philippians in Philippi, you know why he's in prison?
[time=953] Because a man from Macedonia appeared to him and said, "Go to Philippi and preach the gospel." And so he goes.
[time=960] And what happens if I'm imprisoned into the inner dungeon of the prison and what does God do? He knocks the prison down.
[time=968] That's what it means. Every valley raised up, every mountain brought low.
[time=973] Every obstacle to what God will do is removed, is removed.
[time=979] Fear not, verse 9, chapter 40, behold your God.
[time=983] Shouldn't you be afraid? Because God is there.
[time=987] A shepherd will tend his flock gathering lambs in his arms.
[time=991] One of the refrains that you'll see over and over again is, "How is this incomparable, majestic God holding lambs in his arms?" Isn't that kind of beneath him? To be a shepherd?
[time=1003] Shepherds weren't esteemed people. They were taking care of stupid sheep.
[time=1006] Sheep are very small, literally small brain. They can't figure out things.
[time=1010] They have no spatial awareness. They can't tell that that ledge is just a few feet away.
[time=1014] They walk right off of it. That's why a shepherd has to guide them everywhere they go.
[time=1018] They're stupid creatures. He brings this same shepherd God, watch.
[time=1023] The same shepherd God, verse 26, chapter 40, brings out the stars.
[time=1027] And as we sang this a moment ago, calls them by name.
[time=1031] He knows the names of all the stars. More on that later.
[time=1035] He's the everlasting God. We have unnatural strength. Isaiah 40, 31.
[time=1039] Wings like eagles. You can't dream up wings like eagles on your own.
[time=1044] You can comfort yourself with maybe having hope for a bad day and get encouragement.
[time=1049] That's fine. But wings like eagles is unnatural.
[time=1052] It's supernatural. God giving that to his people.
[time=1056] The Lord tramples kings 41, verse 2, underfoot.
[time=1060] In Kenya this morning they are macheteying people to death.
[time=1065] Because an election went badly in the mind of some Kenyan people.
[time=1069] The tribal leaders and the militias and the police in Kenya.
[time=1074] Machine gun crowds of people to disperse them.
[time=1078] Walk through the streets. Blood everywhere. Hard even to imagine.
[time=1083] To that we respond with, we should respond with compassion.
[time=1088] We respond in any way that we can to help the people of Africa in their plight.
[time=1093] Anything we can do, we should be eager to go. Many of you have gone, I'm sure.
[time=1098] God doesn't wring his hands when the Kenyan people are in uproar at whatever shall I do.
[time=1104] God has never said that this morning. Do you understand that?
[time=1107] Whatever shall I do? He tramples kings underfoot.
[time=1112] God's affections are set on the offspring of Abraham 41, verse 8.
[time=1117] All of these things before 42 ever even begins.
[time=1121] It's all in there before 42.
[time=1124] God's presence, his help, his aid, provision, in desperation.
[time=1128] Look at 41, verse 20 with me. Would you please?
[time=1131] 41, verse 20.
[time=1135] All of these things are given, verse 20, that they may see and know, may consider and understand together that the hand of Yahweh has done this.
[time=1146] The Holy One of Israel. That's why God provides.
[time=1150] Why He gives us what we need, not what we want, but what we need.
[time=1154] All those wonderful and very precious promises are given to us that we would know what God is like and sing Hallelujah to Him. It's right that we should do so.
[time=1163] Praise the Lord. He's worthy of our praises.
[time=1166] We'll do a lot of that this morning. I'm so glad.
[time=1169] The last part of chapter 41 is about idols and how silly it is to worship idols.
[time=1175] I used to have a Captain America figurine in my classroom that said Made in Taiwan on the bottom of it.
[time=1180] I used it as an example of how silly it is in Isaiah to worship idols.
[time=1185] Because idols are crafted by people and when the creation magnifies the creator, everything strips side down. It doesn't make any sense.
[time=1193] Why would you worship an idol that you have hammered out, that you've chiseled out, that you've whittled out?
[time=1198] Why would you do that? It's absurd. It's beneath you to do that.
[time=1203] We'll talk about that more later. I must implore you to buy Hondles Messiah.
[time=1209] The whole recording, all two and a half hours, I bought it last week and listened to it about six times so far.
[time=1214] It is overwhelming. What's the most famous part of Hondles Messiah?
[time=1220] The Hallelujah Chorus. That's like number 45 of 48 oratorios in Hondles Messiah.
[time=1228] So all of those things that Isaiah says, comfort my people, purify the sons of Levi.
[time=1234] That's the different movements in Hondles Messiah.
[time=1236] They all lead up to Hallelujah.
[time=1239] For the Lord God Omnipotent Raineth.
[time=1243] Please buy it today. iTunes $8. The best $8 you've ever spent.
[time=1250] London Philharmonic Orchestra Enquire.
[time=1256] Please do it. Worship. Worship as you see God's Word spelled out.
[time=1262] It's Jesus from beginning to end. Hondles Messiah.
[time=1266] Okay. This morning God is delightful in himself.
[time=1269] He delights Isaiah 42. Now ready for Isaiah 42.
[time=1272] Isaiah 42 verse 1. God's delightful son. His servant.
[time=1278] The first word of Isaiah 42 is what?
[time=1282] Behold. I love that. Check it out.
[time=1286] Look. See. Here is my servant.
[time=1291] In contrast to the idols of chapter 41, we have a contrast going on here.
[time=1295] Here are the idols. Here's my servant.
[time=1297] You judge for yourself which was worthy of your affection.
[time=1300] We are called to see him.
[time=1303] Servant Israel is also what Isaiah, and they have sins to be blotted out.
[time=1307] They have blindness. They have confusion.
[time=1310] This servant has none of those things. He is never confused.
[time=1314] He is never distracted. He is never needful.
[time=1320] The servant will be upheld verse 1 by God.
[time=1324] Behold my servant, whom I uphold, who I hold fast.
[time=1329] That's the picture. Hold fast. What a wonderful image that that is.
[time=1333] It's appropriate that God would delight in him.
[time=1336] Does God have a soul? My philosophical daughter, right?
[time=1341] Over Christmas break, we were talking with some friends.
[time=1345] And this friend had a father who was in need of a heart transplant.
[time=1349] And they are telling us to the little girl in the family and saying, "Well, grandpa needs a heart transplant." And so little girl asks the mother, "Mommy, when grandpa gets a new heart, he has to ask Jesus into that one too."
[time=1362] That's pretty good. That's a good question.
[time=1365] You have opportunity to teach, right?
[time=1367] Here's a philosophical question. Does God have a soul?
[time=1370] I don't know. If he does, it delights in Jesus.
[time=1374] That's what God's soul. What delights your soul? What lights you up?
[time=1378] What gets you going through the day? You know what it is for God?
[time=1382] His son.
[time=1384] "I am delighted in my own children." We have a four-year-old daughter Hannah, a one-year-old boy Christian, and they are my delight.
[time=1392] "I am delighted in them. I am more delighted than my wife." God delights in his own son.
[time=1399] God has put his spirit upon him, verse 1.
[time=1402] He will bring forth justice to the nations.
[time=1405] The first point before you in your notes in the bulletin is his excellent justice.
[time=1409] That's the focus of the whole first section is God's excellent justice.
[time=1412] Excellent justice.
[time=1414] His midst pot.
[time=1417] What does it mean? It means setting all things in right order.
[time=1422] He will bring forth justice to the nations, to all the nations.
[time=1427] It's already happened, guys. The gospel is going out to all the nations.
[time=1432] He has set all things in their right order.
[time=1435] This morning, as you walked in, the band was playing once again.
[time=1439] I look upon the cross where you died when Jesus died on the cross.
[time=1443] He defeated sin and death and hell. He rented a powerless forever.
[time=1448] So we already have that. We long for the not yet, though, when all things are made new.
[time=1453] That's our hope and encouragement in a new year.
[time=1456] The God would do these things.
[time=1459] The servant will come and do this.
[time=1461] Holy night is my favorite Christmas song.
[time=1464] My favorite line for my favorite song just might be this.
[time=1468] In his name, all oppression shall cease.
[time=1473] All things in right order. Justice.
[time=1476] That's God's promise to us today.
[time=1479] This justice, ladies and gentlemen, is brought forth.
[time=1482] We don't seek it out. It's not our own terms.
[time=1485] It's given to us by a revealing agent.
[time=1488] God sends out his son to bring forth justice.
[time=1493] To bring forth rightness, right behavior.
[time=1498] And that is excellent. That is good.
[time=1503] The next thing we see in verses two and three is his beautiful gentleness.
[time=1508] His beautiful gentleness.
[time=1512] This sovereign majestic God is also beautifully gentle in his servant.
[time=1516] Remarkable.
[time=1517] The servant will not, verse two, cry aloud.
[time=1520] You know what the Hebrew word for cry aloud is?
[time=1523] Sock.
[time=1524] It means the startle.
[time=1527] Sock.
[time=1528] It sounds like the Hebrew word for thunder.
[time=1530] It's ram.
[time=1532] It's like its own alliteration.
[time=1534] Like pow or bam.
[time=1536] Ram.
[time=1537] It sounds like thunder.
[time=1538] Socks is like startle or he will lift up his voice.
[time=1542] He won't make it heard.
[time=1543] He won't try to dominate or self advertise like politicians.
[time=1548] There is a description of politicians right there.
[time=1551] Startling.
[time=1552] Fear mongering, right?
[time=1554] Lifting up their voices.
[time=1556] Here I am.
[time=1557] Listen to me.
[time=1558] Shine down there.
[time=1559] Talking past each other all the time.
[time=1561] So frustrating.
[time=1563] Not the servant.
[time=1565] A smoldering wick to him.
[time=1567] Look at this verse.
[time=1568] Look at verse three.
[time=1569] A bruised reed he will not break.
[time=1572] A faintly burning wick he will not quench.
[time=1575] He will faithfully bring forth justice.
[time=1578] What good is a bruised reed?
[time=1580] A bent reed.
[time=1581] No good.
[time=1582] Throw it out.
[time=1583] Get a new one.
[time=1584] What good is a burnt wick?
[time=1585] An extinguished wick.
[time=1586] No good.
[time=1587] Get a new candle.
[time=1589] It's burnt out.
[time=1590] Not this servant.
[time=1591] He will not dismiss these people.
[time=1594] The poor.
[time=1595] The downtrodden.
[time=1597] The forgotten.
[time=1598] The overlooked.
[time=1599] He won't do those things.
[time=1601] The bruised reeds.
[time=1603] Faintly burning wicks.
[time=1605] He will care for them because he can.
[time=1607] Watch this.
[time=1609] The broken reeds been internally damaged.
[time=1612] He can fix it.
[time=1614] The wick needs external inertia of oil.
[time=1617] He can do both.
[time=1618] He can cure and supply the reed and the wick.
[time=1621] He can do it for you today.
[time=1624] He's promised he can do it.
[time=1626] The poor and downtrodden won't be.
[time=1629] Snuffed out.
[time=1631] Quenched by him.
[time=1632] Forgotten.
[time=1633] Overlooked.
[time=1634] Used as a political tool for his own greatness.
[time=1638] He condescends to them.
[time=1640] How is that?
[time=1641] This awesome God does this.
[time=1642] The people of Judah and Jerusalem were victimizing the poor.
[time=1645] We've all seen people inside of the road with signs.
[time=1648] Right?
[time=1649] Need food.
[time=1650] What have you?
[time=1652] The picture is that Judah and Jerusalem in 7th century BC, the 8th century BC, were driving past the poor with their signs, taking their signs and driving off.
[time=1662] Victimizing the poor.
[time=1664] Trampling over the poor, not the servant.
[time=1667] He will set all things right.
[time=1669] What's right order as far as the poor is concerned?
[time=1671] What does that mean?
[time=1672] It means that Leviticus 14 and 23, those two chapters, that God's provision for the poor in the fields and the vineyards would be given.
[time=1680] The poor would have what they need and he will care for that.
[time=1683] He will do that this morning.
[time=1685] We should be involved in that.
[time=1687] I'm so glad that this church is involved in that and continues to be involved in it.
[time=1691] Have you seen this?
[time=1692] Look at this on the screen.
[time=1693] He won't.
[time=1697] It's so great.
[time=1699] It's so magnificent that it's only described in terms of what he doesn't do.
[time=1703] It has no precedent.
[time=1705] How can you compare this?
[time=1706] It has no comparison.
[time=1708] His work is so awesome, so beautiful, so wonderful.
[time=1711] It can not be compared to anything else.
[time=1714] So exciting.
[time=1716] Is that reasonable to call God egotistical?
[time=1720] Is that a logical response to what you've just read, what you've sang already?
[time=1725] Is God an egotist?
[time=1727] Even the question collapses under its own way.
[time=1730] As the band comes back up this morning, I invite you to consider that.
[time=1734] God's delightful son, his excellent justice, his beautiful gentleness,
[time=1740] his splendid faithfulness.
[time=1745] I want to read a poem that William Tappen wrote 1822, about verse 4.
[time=1753] "The isles of the south wait for his law.
[time=1756] Your redemption is near, no longer repose in the borders of gloom.
[time=1760] The strength of his chosen and love shall appear, and light shall arise on the verge of the tomb.
[time=1766] The billows that gird you, the wild waves that roar.
[time=1770] The zephyrs that play where the ocean storms cease shall bear the rich freight to your desolate shore,
[time=1778] shall waft the glad tidings of pardon and peace." In conclusion, he says this.
[time=1783] He says, "The heathen will hasten to welcome the time.
[time=1787] The day spring, Luke got 179.
[time=1790] The prophet in vision once saw, when the beams of Messiah will loom in each climb, and the isles of the ocean will wait for his law."
[time=1798] Ferris Lord Jesus, we're going to sing that this morning.
[time=1801] Ferris Lord Jesus, Colossians 1, is infinite greatness.
[time=1806] His infinite greatness, but his care for the least of these, for children, for the poor, the forgotten.
[time=1813] Let's sing together and worship him.
[time=1816] Would you stand with us, please?
[time=1819] He will light cherish.
[time=1829] He will lie on earth, thou my souls glory joy and crown.
[time=1846] [MUSIC - 274 seconds]
[time=2150] I'm always puzzled when people talk about me being a passionate teacher, and they compliment me for it.
[time=2157] I'm thankful for what Kelly said, but I'm always puzzled by that.
[time=2161] How could we not sing passionately? Teach passionately. This kind of God is remarkable. You may be seated.
[time=2168] We have more to talk about. I'm happy to say, more is delightful. God's son is delightful. He is delightful in his excellent justice.
[time=2177] He is delightful in his beautiful gentleness. He is delightful in his splendid faithfulness.
[time=2184] We also see in the second part of this chapter, the first nine verses, that God's work is delightful, his delightful work.
[time=2193] It says there in the first part of verse five, this is what God the Lord, Ha'el Yahweh, says.
[time=2201] This is what he says. God the Lord, the incomparable God, the meaning of that phrase, this is what God the Lord says, something like this, that he is the one who is indeed the transcendent, yes, indescribable God.
[time=2218] That's what that means. He originates, he maintains, he controls, he directs all things.
[time=2225] In the lobby this morning are some copies of a book by John Piper, another book by John Piper, called Don't Waste Your Life.
[time=2231] I commend it to you in the highest possible terms. On the screens before you will be these paragraphs to just a glimpse, again, of his picture of God and his delightfulness.
[time=2244] Please buy the book, please buy it today, please read it today, tomorrow and the days after that, you will not regret it.
[time=2250] This is John Piper's response in some ways to what Dawkins said earlier in the service about God being a megalomaniac and autistical.
[time=2260] He asked this question, does being loved mean being made much of?
[time=2265] For many people, this is not obviously an act of love. They don't feel loved when they are told that God created them for his glory.
[time=2272] They feel used. This is understandable given the way love has almost been completely distorted in our world.
[time=2278] For most people to be loved is to be made much of.
[time=2281] Almost everything in our western culture serves this distortion, distortion of love.
[time=2287] We are taught in a thousand ways that love means increasing someone's self-esteem.
[time=2292] Love is helping someone feel good about themselves. Love is giving someone a mirror and helping him or her like what they see.
[time=2299] This is not what the Bible means, but the love of God. Love is doing what is best for someone.
[time=2305] But making self the object of our highest affections is not best for us.
[time=2310] It is in fact a lethal distraction.
[time=2314] We were made to see and savor God and by savoring him to be supremely satisfied.
[time=2321] And thus spread in all the world the worth of his presence. Not to show people, be all satisfying God, is not to love them.
[time=2331] To make them feel good about themselves, when they were made to feel good about seeing guys, I taken someone to the Alps and locking them in a room full of mirrors.
[time=2340] Pathological at the Grand Canyon is his next section.
[time=2343] The really wonderful moments of joy in this world are not the moments of self satisfaction, but self forgetfulness.
[time=2350] Standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon and contemplating your own greatness is pathological.
[time=2355] At such moments we were made for a magnificent joy that comes from outside ourselves.
[time=2361] And each of these rare and precious moments in life, beside the canyon, before the Alps, under the stars, is an echo of a far greater excellence, namely God's own glory.
[time=2373] That's why the Bible says the heavens declare the glory of God. The sky above proclaims his handiwork.
[time=2380] Sometimes people say that they can't believe that. If there is a God, he would take interest in a little tiny speck of humanity and a little planet called Earth.
[time=2388] The universe they say is too vast. It makes man utterly insignificant.
[time=2392] Why would God have bothered to create such a microscopic speck called the Earth in humanity, and that get involved with us?
[time=2399] Well, beneath that question is a fundamental failure to see what the universe is about. It's about the greatness of God.
[time=2407] Not a significance of man. God made man small, and the universe big to something about himself.
[time=2415] He says it for us to learn and enjoy, namely that he is infinitely great and powerful and wise and beautiful.
[time=2426] There are some images from the Hubble telescope you'll see in just a moment. Consider this.
[time=2431] The more the Hubble telescope sends back to us about the unfathomable depths of space, the more we should stand in awe of God.
[time=2440] The disproportionate between us and the universe is a parable about the disproportionate between us and God. It's an understatement.
[time=2449] But the point is not to nullify us, but to glorify him.
[time=2454] Just a glimpse. That's the kind of God that we're talking about.
[time=2458] How could it be egotistical of God to demand of us what is best for us?
[time=2463] That's benevolent. That's kind. That's gracious. More on that later.
[time=2469] Look at these words in chapter 42 and verse 5.
[time=2473] God, the Lord says this. He created the heavens. He stretched them out, spread out the earth, and what comes from it.
[time=2478] God made the heavens his tent. He made the earth a firm foundation.
[time=2483] A Hebrew word for the earth there to spread it out is to hammer it down, to make it a firm foundation.
[time=2489] He did it well. But also everything that comes from it is God's too.
[time=2493] Everything and what comes from it. So he does this to the heavens. He creates, he stretches out, he spreads, he gives.
[time=2502] So God is concerned about the heavens. It's a good job there. But what about us? Look at what it says.
[time=2507] In verse 6, his delicate care. God's delightful work. We see that.
[time=2512] And now we see his delicate care even in this. This kind of a God who in one verse is splendorously majestic.
[time=2519] That same God does this for people. He calls them. He takes them. He keeps them. He gives them.
[time=2524] And we see this in verse 6 that he has made his servant and those who are called by his name, a light for the nation.
[time=2532] Simeon sings that song in Luke chapter 2. Now I can depart in peace because of what my eyes have seen.
[time=2538] A light for the nations and to my people Israel.
[time=2541] We see also in verse 7, his remarkable deliverance. His remarkable deliverance.
[time=2547] Blind eyes. Prisoners and dungeons. Captives to darkness.
[time=2552] They are all set free. Is it any wonder that Jesus shows up in the gospels curing blindness?
[time=2560] Curing deafness. Lame-ness. Forgiving sins.
[time=2566] Casting out demons. It's exactly what he said he would do. Here in this verse.
[time=2570] That's exactly what it means. What we would expect from him.
[time=2574] Luke 1.79 is the song of all these songs in the first chapters of Luke is singing because of what Christ is and who he is and what he's done.
[time=2583] In Zacharias, John the Baptist's father sings this song.
[time=2586] This prophecy in Luke 1.79 says to give light to those who sit in the shadow of darkness and death to guide our feet into the way of peace.
[time=2597] Is that kind of a God egotistical? This caring God. This sustaining, creating God.
[time=2606] Is that kind of a God egotistical for demanding from me what he rightly deserves?
[time=2611] The question just seems insulting to us. Isaiah 42, as we sing together this morning, as we continue to sing, it is right and good that we would sing praise to the Lord.
[time=2624] And this morning I would invite you to sing an informed song of worship now.
[time=2630] Informed by his word. God's word is given to us that we would know him, that we would love him better, that we would sing these songs of praise to him.
[time=2639] We see songs in Isaiah. Sing to the Lord a new song that says in verse 10 of 42.
[time=2644] Let's sing to him a new song this morning. Sing to him the praise which he so richly deserves.
[time=2654] Praise to the Lord the Almighty, the King of Creation.
[time=2671] Oh my soul, praise him for he is my help and salvation. Oh he who he now to his temple drawn here.
[time=2688] To be in blood out ofation.
[time=2700] Praise to the Lord who are all things so wondrously pregnant.
[time=2709] The shelters, the under you, your swings, your soul gently sustained.
[time=2717] Has thou not seen how all the longings have been?
[time=2726] Sent it in one day.
[time=2738] And praise to the Lord who doth prosper thy work and defend me.
[time=2747] Surely his goodness and mercy, you take me, God tell me, Father I will not be all I can do.
[time=2764] Live with his love he be handy.
[time=2774] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=2793] Praise to the Lord, oh there, oh there he is and he got started.
[time=2806] Oh that have life and death come down with praises before death.
[time=2815] Happy of man, sound from his people again.
[time=2824] Happy forever again.
[time=2833] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=2861] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=2902] Hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent raineth.
[time=2909] Said to handle, say us all.
[time=2913] Amen, let the amend, sound from his people again, there it was.
[time=2918] Has thou not seen how all thy longings have been granted in what he ordains?
[time=2926] Everything that we want is in his hands, that we truly want in our souls.
[time=2933] Man's soul is restless, said Augustine until it finds its rest in him.
[time=2942] God is delightful, he delights in his son, he delights, he is delightful in what he does in his work but he is also as we see now in the last few verses of our Texas morning delightful because of who he is.
[time=2955] His delightful character is the third major point.
[time=2959] We see first of all his glorious name, Alec Motyer said this about the glorious name of God.
[time=2968] He said God's greatness before us is expressed most clearly in his name, his great name.
[time=2980] Here we go.
[time=2981] The self proclamation of the Lord reveals him as distinct personal identity with his own name.
[time=2986] Kelly told you my name this morning and it wasn't air called.
[time=2990] Steve Western.
[time=2992] "He does not exist incognito," says Alec Motyer, "in the world's gods.
[time=2998] His glory cannot be shared.
[time=3001] They may ape him." I love that ape him, achieve a coincidental resemblance, but he's not there, there is an element of hostility in the situation.
[time=3011] He will not ultimately tolerate the according to dead gods of the praise due to him alone.
[time=3017] He will not, he must not, if he did he wouldn't be God.
[time=3022] We see here first of all friends his glorious name.
[time=3026] I am the Lord, that is my name, I am Yahweh, the Jews and synagogues today will not say the name Yahweh.
[time=3034] They say I don't I, they replace it with the more generic term for Lord in the Old Testament.
[time=3039] Why?
[time=3040] Because they hold that name Hashem, the name, they hold that in such a clear and precious distinction, they won't even speak it out.
[time=3048] It's falling out of pronunciation altogether.
[time=3050] We guess it's Yahweh, we only know how it's even spoken.
[time=3054] That's how great his name is.
[time=3056] I am Yahweh, the name he gave to Moses and the bush that was burned but not burned up.
[time=3061] I'm Yahweh, that's my name.
[time=3063] My glory I give to no other.
[time=3068] How unspeakable and grotesque is it?
[time=3073] To give the glory due to the Father to someone else.
[time=3077] It's grotesque.
[time=3079] The malevolence that Dawkins talks about in that book, it would be malevolent of God.
[time=3085] It would be evil of God to insist from you and I that we give anyone else glory.
[time=3090] That would be evil.
[time=3092] Far from his insistence on his own glory being evil, God's insistence that someone else be glorified, not him, that's evil, that's malevolent, that's cruel.
[time=3102] If someone came to you and asked you for directions to some place, you can imagine where it might be, where is such and such.
[time=3108] And you knew what that place was but you deliberately told them to go another direction.
[time=3112] The place that they would never arrive at that destination.
[time=3115] That would make you cruel.
[time=3117] If you took joy in their lostness, you would be cruel.
[time=3121] And exactly what God would be if he told you to worship anybody else but himself.
[time=3125] It's all coming together.
[time=3127] My glory I give to no other.
[time=3129] My praise, nor my praise to carved idols, carved made in Taiwan.
[time=3134] Idols, things that you hammer out yourself.
[time=3138] How demeaning is it to us, not to him, but even to us to worship things that are not him.
[time=3144] The chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[time=3149] Anything less than that is insulting to ourselves but much more beyond that.
[time=3156] We see next is inexpressible magnificence.
[time=3159] We slung about that this morning, right?
[time=3164] We should do so.
[time=3167] I hear all the time, wait until you get to the real world, students.
[time=3170] This is a rant that my students will know.
[time=3173] Here's Mr. Webster's rant.
[time=3175] The real world rant is called.
[time=3177] What is the real world?
[time=3179] Out there?
[time=3180] A cruel place that's doggy, dog, and I'll get you and looking after myself.
[time=3185] Is that real?
[time=3186] That's not real.
[time=3188] What is real is the God who made the world revealing himself to us and the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3195] That's real.
[time=3197] Whatever doesn't proclaim that is not real.
[time=3199] It's a fabrication.
[time=3201] It's a game.
[time=3202] It's magicianship.
[time=3203] It's showmanship.
[time=3204] Look at my hands.
[time=3205] I'll be here.
[time=3206] You're making your move.
[time=3207] It's unreal.
[time=3208] There's no rabbit in the hat.
[time=3211] That's not real.
[time=3215] Idols are carved, chiseled out.
[time=3218] They have no vision.
[time=3219] They have no power.
[time=3220] They have no grace.
[time=3221] They have no mercy, no creativity.
[time=3225] When I worship things that are not God, that are created not in his image, but in my own image,
[time=3231] I cease to be real.
[time=3233] I worship unreal gods who have, they have eyes.
[time=3236] Can't see.
[time=3237] They have ears.
[time=3238] Can't hear.
[time=3239] They have legs and arms.
[time=3241] They can't touch to heal.
[time=3243] They can't walk around to deliver you.
[time=3245] They can't watch this.
[time=3247] They can't carry around their arms.
[time=3249] When you need comfort, they can't do that.
[time=3252] Their arms can't move.
[time=3258] In the New Year, friends, I offer you our last point today.
[time=3262] His sublime novelty, sublime.
[time=3266] Sublime is a word that just means it could not get any better.
[time=3270] And I agree, that's pretty good.
[time=3273] Now, behold, the former things have come to pass.
[time=3278] New things I now declare.
[time=3280] Have you written it away on a check yet or something else?
[time=3282] Isn't it weird to write '08 after you've written '07 so very many times?
[time=3286] You'll get it tomorrow, guys, away on your papers.
[time=3289] It'll be weird for you.
[time=3290] Maybe not.
[time=3291] I don't know.
[time=3292] It was weird for me.
[time=3293] God is the God of new things.
[time=3294] I love the New Year.
[time=3295] I believe in resolutions in a New Year.
[time=3298] It's an occasion for us to revisit things we should have done better.
[time=3301] I believe in that.
[time=3303] Even better.
[time=3304] Rabbi Zacharias, hero of mine.
[time=3308] He says this, "Every pleasure has a shelf life.
[time=3312] Only God is the perpetual novelty.
[time=3317] Every pleasure has a shelf life.
[time=3319] Only God is the perpetual novelty.
[time=3321] He will never, ever grow old."
[time=3327] New things?
[time=3328] The God has watched this.
[time=3330] This is a brief list.
[time=3332] New songs, Psalm 40, Isaiah 42, verse 10.
[time=3337] New names.
[time=3338] He gives us a new name.
[time=3340] Only he knows.
[time=3341] New heavens and New earth, Isaiah 65.
[time=3343] The new covenant of Jeremiah 31.
[time=3346] New mercies.
[time=3347] Every morning.
[time=3348] Great as thy faithfulness.
[time=3351] New heart.
[time=3352] New spirit.
[time=3353] Ezekiel 36.
[time=3354] Mark 1.
[time=3355] Christ comes with a new teaching with authority.
[time=3357] He isn't relying on anybody else but his own insight.
[time=3362] New life in Romans 6.
[time=3364] New creation.
[time=3365] Second Corinthians.
[time=3366] New selves.
[time=3367] New commandments.
[time=3368] New Jerusalem.
[time=3369] What's New Jerusalem made out of, by the way?
[time=3373] Jewels.
[time=3374] Precious stones.
[time=3375] Why?
[time=3376] If I told you my doorknob was made out of an emerald.
[time=3379] One big solid emerald.
[time=3380] It wouldn't be there by 230.
[time=3381] It would be gone.
[time=3382] It'd be in the pawn shop.
[time=3383] Off they go.
[time=3384] And rightly so.
[time=3386] Who makes a doorknob out of an emerald?
[time=3388] Why?
[time=3389] Because my door is not secure.
[time=3391] Not New Jerusalem.
[time=3392] New Jerusalem was made out of precious jewels.
[time=3395] Streets of gold.
[time=3396] Gates made out of a single pearl.
[time=3397] Right?
[time=3398] We all know these things.
[time=3399] Heaven.
[time=3400] New Jerusalem.
[time=3401] Never under threat.
[time=3403] No crying.
[time=3404] No mourning.
[time=3405] No pain.
[time=3406] No armies will ever march against that city to build siege towers against it.
[time=3412] Never be under threat because God himself is on the throne.
[time=3415] The lame is the light.
[time=3418] Glorious.
[time=3419] New things.
[time=3420] All these things are God's involvement in newness today.
[time=3426] Oh, God declares all these things with certainty.
[time=3429] It says in verse 9 before they take place.
[time=3431] That's a hard to believe.
[time=3433] The God knows the future.
[time=3435] Not for me.
[time=3439] As the band plays again this morning, I invite you.
[time=3444] I beg you in this new year to consider God's delightfulness.
[time=3451] That he is delightful in himself but also what he delights in is his son Jesus.
[time=3455] And this morning it would give him great joy in delight that you would call him by name.
[time=3461] That you would scream out to him, "Father, forgive me." In the person of his son he has provided for that forgiveness.
[time=3468] In this new year I plead with you to consider God and all his delightfulness.
[time=3474] And he is delightful but in what God delights in in the person of his son.
[time=3479] That's the best resolution that you could possibly make in the new year.
