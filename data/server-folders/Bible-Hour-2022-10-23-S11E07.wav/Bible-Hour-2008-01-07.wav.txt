[time=60] Well hello again everybody, welcome to the broadcast today.
[time=63] We're so grateful that you've tuned in, and I want you to know how thankful I am to be a part of this team here at Blackhawk, and we are so grateful that we get to be a part of this broadcast, and all that God does through it each, and every week, you know, in recent weeks.
[time=78] I think I've talked with people from, from Bern, Indiana, all the way to Decatur, from Decatur down to Bluffton, Bluffton over to Rowanoke. I talked to someone, several folks, last week from Huntington, and got an email this last week from someone in Kendallville, was even at a golf tournament several months ago, with some young people where I met someone in Coldwater, Michigan, who watches the broadcast. It's amazing to me how many people got allows to be impacted and influenced by what we're able to do here at Blackhawk. We're thankful that you're tuning in, and I want you to know that today on the broadcast, you are going to see something very powerful, and I think very effective. You're going to hear a message from God's word that I know is powerful, not because it's from me, but because it's from the scriptures, but some students here at Blackhawk have put together a dramatic presentation that I think will absolutely both blow you away in its real and very graphic portrayal of Satan's attempts
[time=146] to capture and influence and destroy our next generation, and it will also inspire you and remind you of the great protector and the great friend we have in Jesus. It is a tremendous drama, and I can't wait for you to see it, and I hope as you watch, you'll just be reminded of what a great and enduring love our Lord has for you, whether you're a student or whether you're an adult, no matter who you are, what stage of life you're in, when you know him, he, as this drama depicts, he stands with you, he fights for you, he wants nothing more than to love you and bring you through the challenges and the trials of life.
[time=188] Be encouraged as you watch, know how very thankful we are for you, and we'll look forward hopefully to hearing from you and seeing you soon. God bless you. Have a great day. Where do you think temptation comes from? I think it's a basic fundamental element of human nature. Well, you're deep, man. I don't have a clue. That's a good
[time=209] question. It's just, I mean, it's a basic survival desire, I think, and a lot of us. The desire for food, desire to reproduce, but in our society where everything's so accessible,
[time=222] you can kind of build up too much access to the things that tempt you.
[time=227] Tell me where you think temptation comes from. Where do I think it comes from?
[time=231] Oh, you want me to say Satan? Tell me three things that people are
[time=238] really tempted with. Money, greed, and sex. Money have power. Sex. Greed. Cheating,
[time=247] maybe. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Uh, fame, money, gender. What do you mean
[time=254] by gender? Sexual preferences. What do you think are some of the things
[time=261] that people can do to effectively resist temptation? Oh, that's a hard question to
[time=268] ask. That's a hard question to ask. Tell me some ways we can
[time=276] effectively deal with temptation, or should we even deal with it at all?
[time=281] I think that it's up to each individual to decide what's important to them and to set goals and stay there for themselves. Deal with it is to, I guess, avoid
[time=293] situations like you'd be tempted by them and they're like not good at like if you're not in the drugs, don't go to place the drugs you're going to be at and don't get yourself in situations that you can't avoid. What do you think people can do to resist temptation?
[time=310] How do you pray? Where do you think temptation comes from?
[time=316] Um, well power. Yeah, if you're not a strong mind individual,
[time=323] temptation can definitely get the better of you.
[time=326] Gotta have a strong faith in God too, you know, to override temptation.
[time=332] Where do you think temptation comes from? I think people try and
[time=341] they're looking for something more or they have this desire that needs to be fulfilled and they see these things that they think will be able to fulfill that, but so maybe to fill a void.
[time=362] You know, it's interesting as I watched that video several times now.
[time=373] One gal kind of I think mockingly referenced it, but when asked the basic question, where does temptation come from?
[time=381] So many people hesitate to just say it. They talk about temptation. I mean, every question that was asked about where temptation comes from, they talked about temptation, but they didn't answer the question.
[time=392] Temptation comes from who? Say, say, yeah, a very real being
[time=400] engaged in a very real battle with you and your soul.
[time=407] And it was about two years ago that on Sunday mornings over a six-week span
[time=413] that we brought to you, we just did our very best to from the scriptures and from the experiences of life and ministry here, we brought to you a series that we entitled kidnapped. Many of you may remember that.
[time=425] Satan's attempt to abduct the next generation.
[time=429] And what we told you almost two years ago during kidnapped is the same. It still holds true today. What Nebuchadnezzar tried to do with those four young men in Daniel as he tried to remove them from authority, as he tried to change their identity, as he tried to strip them of all that they had grown to know, as he tried to take them away from what was good, right, and true, the enemy today continues to do that very thing, and the lengths to which he will go are limitless. And as I think about, not only our next and current generation of younger men and women, when I think about you, when I think about an older generation, you see, he's generationless in his scope. He comes after anybody, and his hope and his desire is the same, to ruin and destroy.
[time=482] And when I think about that, especially as it relates to our young men and women, it just leads me to be so very thankful for Jesse Hannah. Jesse's been a part of our team for a while now, and he and Amy and their family are a part of this family, and he and Amy bring leadership and investment and time and energy, not only to their team there in 212 and in student ministries with both liquid and 212, but they teach the scriptures, they meet in small groups.
[time=510] Jesse and his staff make a relational and truth investment in our young people, and God is doing amazing things. He really is through that. We want to bring to you this morning a dramatic presentation. I'm going to let Jesse introduce it in just a moment, but I sent an email out this week, and I want to just make sure that I again give you kind of a heads up. Some folks called in and wanted me to define what I meant by graphic and intense, and as I shared with them some
[time=540] of the particulars of the piece, a few of them said, "Oh, well, you know, that's that's not anything more than they see on TV," which was my point.
[time=551] There are things that I know when I think of a little young one, you know, and oftentimes you bring little young ones in here. There's things that I want you to introduce to them when you think it's time, and so I wanted to just make sure that as this drama unfolds, you know, if you wanted to slip out, that's great, with a little one, I think for the most part it is what our students are seeing on TV. None of it's new to them, they all are aware of it.
[time=576] I guess I kind of wanted to be over-reactive instead of under-reactive and just let you know that this is something that I'm very much in favor of.
[time=584] It's not over-the-top, it's not inappropriate, it is a real depiction of what we've talked about for a long, long time, and I'm going to have Jesse coming up now and introduce it to you. I know you're grateful for Jesse, and I know how thankful you are for what he and Amy do.
[time=601] I'm glad he's here, and I'll let him talk to you for a moment.
[time=606] Thanks, Kelly. Yeah, we did this drama a few weeks ago at 212, and it was just a powerful night. It was a fantastic night. The kids did a great job of inviting their friends in hopes of having conversations afterward about Christ and what he can do for them, and what you're going to see is reality.
[time=625] The truth is scary, and that's why Kelly had asked some of those younger ones to leave, but this is reality. This is an over-germatatized thing. This is real. This is things I see in students' lives very often, sadly, very often, and so I don't want you to think, "Oh, that's just a drama, and that's okay." No, this is real.
[time=646] This is the reality of the things that Satan uses to take our students and our
[time=652] teenagers out. He wants them to be as far away from Jesus Christ as possible, and that's what you're going to see.
[time=667] [MUSIC]
[time=683] I want to feel you. I need to hear you.
[time=703] You love a light that's leading me to the place
[time=719] Where I find peace, walking
[time=734] You are the strength that cheers me, O King
[time=745] You are the hope that cheers me, Trustings
[time=756] You are the light into my soul
[time=766] You are my purpose, you're everything
[time=775] You are the hope that you're in, and I'll be moved by you, but you tell me I could have been any better than them. Yeah.
[time=805] You come the storms when you give me gas
[time=823] You hold me in your hands, you won't let me fall
[time=833] You're still my heart when you take my breath away
[time=844] Would you take me in, take me deeper now
[time=854] The doubt can I stand here? You love a light that's leading me, but you tell me I could have been any better than them.
[time=875] You tell can I stand here with you, and I'll be moved by you, but you tell me I could have been any better than them.
[time=897] 'Cause you're all I need, you're everything
[time=940] When doubt can I stand here with you, and I'll be moved by you, but you tell me I could have been any better than me, but you tell me I could have been any better than me, but you tell me I could have been any better than them.
[time=964] You're still my heart when you take me in, but you tell me I could have been any better than me, but you tell me I could have been any better than me.
[time=984] Every time I see that, I cry, I cry the first of it too. I think one of the reasons that is so powerful, and I think so many of us can relate to some of those things, and that's good, if not all of them, I know in my life I can relate to some of those things when I was in high school.
[time=999] It's amazing that Christ has never given up on me, never, no matter how far I tried to strain, no matter how far I made dumb decisions I made, he was always there to jump in at the right moment and take it and take the beating so that I wouldn't have to.
[time=1020] My message is universal to every single one of us. Every single one of us has a need for that, for that Savior. We think, oh that's just what teenage, no, it's all of us. Christ, it is universal, the way he stands in there and takes the beatings, that's for all of us, that's what he did for each and every single one of us here today, whether you believe in Jesus Christ or not, it's true, truth doesn't work that way, it's true because it's true, not because you believe it or not.
[time=1049] The only other thing I'd ask is, what's in the way for you today? What's pulling you away from your sincere and awesome devotion to Christ? What's pulling you away from having that relationship that is so very important in your life?
[time=1066] Because we can see what happens when we stray from Christ.
[time=1079] In Christ alone, my hope is found. He is my light, my strength and my song. This cornerstone, this solid ground, it's firm, it's firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
[time=1092] It's the light of love and what depths of peace when fears are still, when our striving sace,
[time=1102] my comforter, my all in all, here in the love of Christ I stand. No guilt in life and no fear in death.
[time=1117] This is the power of Christ in me, from life's first cry and to my final breath, Jesus, Jesus commands my destiny.
[time=1130] No power of hell and no scheme of man could ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ.
[time=1147] I will stand till he returns or calls me home here in the love of Christ, I'll stand.
[time=1173] As Corbin plays, would you just keep your heads bowed and maybe just your eyes closed and just think with me for a moment?
[time=1183] I just feel compelled sitting down there watching that again and then hearing Tanya read through the lyrics to that wonderful song that we'll sing in a little while here.
[time=1196] I just felt compelled to give you the opportunity. I know that there are those in the room this morning, as Jesse referenced, and you know about him, but you don't know him yet.
[time=1209] You've been thinking and you've been studying and you've been asking and you've been seeking, but you've yet to come to that point where you have bowed the knee of your heart and soul
[time=1223] and fully and absolutely devoted and surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=1229] And I want to just give you that opportunity. I do. In the quietness of your heart, you may sense that God is, and those of us that know the Lord know that's exactly what he does.
[time=1240] He draws you to himself. It is his grace. He draws you to himself. It is he who saves you and redeems you.
[time=1250] And he gives you the opportunity to bow. And I want to just give you the chance and the quietness of your heart to just say to him, "Oh God, I know my sin separates me from you."
[time=1265] And, "Oh God, I know that the enemy wants nothing more than to keep me away from you. Oh God, I surrender my heart and life to you right now.
[time=1277] I recognize that Jesus paid the price for my sin, and I commit my heart and my soul and my life and my future to you.
[time=1289] I am so grateful. Just tell him. I am so grateful, God, for the sacrifice of your Son. And I commit to live in relationship with him.
[time=1300] I believe that your spirit will indwell me. I believe that your word will teach me.
[time=1306] And God, thank you for these people who will walk with me.
[time=1311] Father God, thank you for saving me. Thank you for your patience with me. And I commit to live with you now and forever.
[time=1323] Father God, what a joy it is and what a privilege to be a part of a place, a people, a family, like this where we can invite people.
[time=1331] Powerful and real in tangible ways, God, to a life of surrender in relationship with you and for those that prayed those words, God, for those in the room this morning,
[time=1343] who have come to that place where they were ready and are ready and are surrendering their hearts and lives to you even now as we speak.
[time=1351] God, know how grateful we are as a family of believers to be able to come alongside and encourage them.
[time=1358] May we do that with great courage and determination. May we do that mostly, God, with your help.
[time=1365] And all the people in the room were grateful. And all the people said, amen. Amen. Thank you, Corbin.
[time=1375] Well, hey, let me just begin by saying thank you again to Jesse and Amy. Amy Hannah did a great job of preparing that team as they worked on that dramatic presentation.
[time=1386] And as Jesse mentioned, they performed that in 212 on Wednesday night several weeks ago for our student ministry.
[time=1395] They have performed it now here this morning twice and now they're beginning to be contacted by other local churches in Fort Wayne that are asking them to come to their Sunday morning gatherings and present that as well.
[time=1407] So we want to pray for them and continue to stand with them as God uses them in their effort.
[time=1413] We're grateful for each and every one of those young people, thankful for Amy and those who helped.
[time=1418] And what a great picture of a Christ who pulls for us, a Christ who stands in the gap and fights for us and I'm grateful.
[time=1427] Those of you in the room that know him, that know the Lord, you know what that means.
[time=1432] You know how much we benefit from his willingness, his readiness to stand and defend and protect.
[time=1441] It's very appropriate having seen that, that we come now to a passage in our 1 John study that is absolutely related.
[time=1449] Would you join me in 1 John chapter 2 verses 15 to 17.
[time=1455] 1 John chapter 2 verses 15 to 17.
[time=1460] And we come to a very, very interesting passage.
[time=1463] Let me, before we jump in there, let me just get this out of the way, I forgot to mention this to you.
[time=1467] How grateful I was last week for Steve Webster.
[time=1471] Many of you commented and others of you wrote in just a phenomenal opportunity for us to hear last week from one who teaches Bible here at our high school.
[time=1480] Steve did a fantastic job and in the, in the course of his message he mentioned to you a book that he invited you to read.
[time=1487] It's a great read. Don't waste your life by John Piper.
[time=1490] That book is available today out in the four year for you.
[time=1494] I think it's just a few bucks, well worth the investment.
[time=1498] John Piper, don't waste your life. Make sure you pick that up.
[time=1501] Today on your way out.
[time=1503] Well, we come back to our study of 1 John this morning.
[time=1506] And in our study of 1 John, there's several different ways that we can say this.
[time=1511] There have been a few different ways we've come at this, but let me just say it to you this way again this morning.
[time=1516] John was concerned.
[time=1518] The church there in the Ephesus region was under great attack.
[time=1522] The philosophy, the false teaching known as Gnosticism had permeated not only that culture, but the church as well.
[time=1529] The truth of God's word and that which the church had been founded on was being attacked.
[time=1535] There was a Gnostic, a Gnosticism Gnostic philosophy that was, that was depleting the image of Christ.
[time=1542] It was tearing away at the foundation of truth.
[time=1545] Uh, hyper, hyper spiritual stuff was being adored and the physical was being ignored.
[time=1552] And so John, God through John feels compelled to write and he brings to us this great book of 1 John, 2 John and 3 John.
[time=1561] As we've made our way through up until this point, what we've seen is basically this.
[time=1565] John wants to make sure that people understand the basics and the foundations of this faith, this faith that's being attacked.
[time=1575] There were some even who were proclaiming to be Christ followers and in the midst of the depletion of doctrine,
[time=1583] John wasn't so sure that they were.
[time=1587] He wasn't so sure that they could be after all that which they had been taught and that which was being modeled was now,
[time=1593] uh, this depleted image of what had originally been intended.
[time=1598] So what, and I said this to you a few weeks ago, what John does in essence is he kind of provides people in these, in these pages of 1 John tests.
[time=1608] It's like a, a spiritual, uh, salvation, validation test.
[time=1613] If you really know him, then your life and your heart will be like this, John says.
[time=1618] And then he describes this, he allows us to read and then assess the genuineness and the realness and the authenticity of our commitment to Christ.
[time=1631] So far, we've seen three tests.
[time=1634] Let me just take you back to chapter one right there in the beginning was the test of a proper view of Christ.
[time=1640] The test of a proper view of Christ, we won't read through that, but there at the beginning of chapter one, John sets straight what the Gnostics had tried to dissuade people from, a true and accurate view of both the spiritual and physicalness of our Lord.
[time=1657] He says, if you're going to truly follow Christ, if you're going to raise your hand and proclaim your faith, then understand this is what you will believe about Christ, the test of a proper view of Christ.
[time=1671] There was also the test of obedience in the second half of chapter one.
[time=1676] And then on end of chapter two, you can pick it up right there in chapter two, verse three.
[time=1681] If you've got your Bibles, look at this test of obedience.
[time=1684] By this we know, chapter two, verse three, that we have come to know him.
[time=1688] You know that you have come to know him if we keep his commandments.
[time=1694] The one who says, I have come to know him and does not keep his commandments is a liar.
[time=1701] And the truth is not in him.
[time=1704] But whoever keeps his word, verse five, in him the love of God has truly been perfected.
[time=1710] There was the test of a proper view of Christ.
[time=1713] There was the test of obedience and then we came to the test of love.
[time=1718] As chapter two progresses, there is the test of love.
[time=1722] He says, the one who says he is in the light, look at chapter two, verse nine.
[time=1727] The one who says he is in the light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now.
[time=1733] The one who loves his brother abides in the light and there is no cause for stumbling in him.
[time=1740] The one who is in the darkness hates his brother.
[time=1742] The one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going.
[time=1748] John says it's so important that people understand that if you know him, you will love him.
[time=1753] And you will not only love him, God, you will love others.
[time=1757] Your life will be marked by characterized by a love for God and a love for others.
[time=1763] Who you love.
[time=1765] Now as we come to chapter two, verses 15 to 17, watch this, the test of love continues.
[time=1772] But now it's not going to be marked by or defined by who or what you love.
[time=1777] Now in 15 to 17, we find that true believers, those of the genuine faith, will not love something.
[time=1789] We've been talking on and on and on about who we are to love.
[time=1792] Now John says there's something, there's something very important that you shouldn't love.
[time=1799] Now when believers don't love this.
[time=1804] And if you'll stand with me in honor of God's Word, let me read to you, 1 John 2, 15 to 17.
[time=1812] Where it says do not love the world, nor the things in the world.
[time=1818] If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[time=1825] For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life
[time=1831] is not from the Father, but is from the world.
[time=1835] And the world is what?
[time=1836] Say it out loud.
[time=1838] Passing away.
[time=1840] It's futile.
[time=1841] It's empty.
[time=1842] It's not lasting.
[time=1844] It's not eternal.
[time=1845] And also it's lusts, but the one who does interesting here, the one who does the will of God,
[time=1852] the one who does not love the world, lives forever.
[time=1861] Do you love the world?
[time=1864] Pray with me, would you Father God, we stand again and just offer this time to you.
[time=1869] Oh God, please.
[time=1871] Would you use the Spirit of God and the Word of God to convict, encourage and remind and
[time=1877] teach and enlighten the people of God?
[time=1882] But through what you have for us today, may we better understand what the posture of our
[time=1889] hearts, the posture of our lives, our hearts and souls God is to be as it relates to this place in which we live.
[time=1897] Father God, we thank you for the morning already.
[time=1900] Thank you for the worship and the praise and the adoration.
[time=1904] We've already had the joy of offering you God as we give you now our hearts and minds.
[time=1909] So you fill it with that, which is true in your son's name we pray.
[time=1913] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1915] Well, as we make our way through and we will today and in the Sundays to come, the remaining
[time=1922] parts of this passage, we're going to find, you're going to see four things, four very important things regarding the relationship, the posture of your heart and mind, the way in which we are to live and breathe and function.
[time=1935] You and I in the everyday of life in this world, there are some great truths for us to
[time=1941] see and understand.
[time=1942] And as we make our way through this passage, you'll see four things.
[time=1945] I want to just tell you those four things right now.
[time=1947] You're going to see the warning, you're going to see the declaration, you're going to see the prediction and the promise.
[time=1954] God's warning, my friends, God's declaration, God's prediction and God's promise regarding
[time=1963] Christ followers and the world and the future and your heart and mind.
[time=1969] Let's start with verse 15, the warning, God's warning to you and I.
[time=1974] It says there simply do not love the world nor the things in the world.
[time=1982] Now, let's just take that phrase.
[time=1984] Let's just do what we oftentimes do for clarity's sake and hopefully for even a clearer approach
[time=1990] to application because we want you to leave this place, not just having been hearers of the word, but what?
[time=1997] Doers of the word.
[time=1998] I think in order for us to get there, it's important that you and I understand specifically
[time=2004] what just a few of these words mean.
[time=2006] It says do not what love the world.
[time=2009] Let's look at this word love and this context here, people in this passage, you'll want to define, you might even want to write this down, where it says do not love, love here means to have an affection for, to have an affection for, to be emotionally and even
[time=2024] passionately devoted.
[time=2027] I want you to think about those things that you're affectionate toward.
[time=2035] This word here brings into play not just a cognitive reality, but a visceral, emotional,
[time=2043] way down, deep inside, there are things that we feel about and in that feeling we're affectionate,
[time=2050] think about those that you're affectionate with, think about those that you hug, think about those that you give a kiss to, think about those whose hands you hold, think about those that you long to be with.
[time=2061] There is this longing, this desire that comes with affection and that's what this word is talking about, do not, do not long to be affectionate with, do not desire in an emotional, passionate
[time=2076] way, the world.
[time=2083] That definition can be divided up really into two words and I'd want you to think about those two words.
[time=2088] One, the one we just talked about affection, devotion would be the second.
[time=2092] Do not be devoted.
[time=2094] Do not love the world.
[time=2096] There is an affection that we describe, this longing to be with, this emotional attachment,
[time=2102] this wanting to be and then the devotion comes in and what the devotion communicates is that affection again and again and again and again because devotion communicates commitment.
[time=2115] Affection draws me to this and devotion has me giving myself to it on a regular, ongoing
[time=2122] everyday basis and he says do not on an ongoing, everyday basis be giving your affection here
[time=2131] and here to the world.
[time=2138] Gnosticism, let me just try to, while there is a lot for you and I to apply in the everyday of our lives today, Gnosticism in this day, watch and it's still, there's a lot of carry over between that day and Gnosticism and today and worldly thought.
[time=2152] Gnosticism had so devalued, remember, the physical and the material.
[time=2159] Gnosticism had said the physical, you know, the body, the physical is so inconsequential and Gnosticism had placed such a high priority on the spiritual and the mental and the philosophical
[time=2170] that in essence were saying and they were saying it even in the church, it doesn't matter what you do with your body.
[time=2177] It doesn't matter what sexual or moral choices you make, what you do with your body is of no consequence, all that matters is what you do with your mind and spirit.
[time=2189] John comes along, God through the pen of John begins to right that wrong and he says do not love, do not be affectionate or devoted in your heart, soul and mind or body to the
[time=2202] world.
[time=2205] Now before we step back and even look more closely at that, I think it's important that we take some time and understand the phrase of the world.
[time=2213] Can we do that?
[time=2214] I don't know what comes to your mind when you hear me say or when you see here in the Scriptures, do not love the world.
[time=2221] What does that mean?
[time=2223] What do you think that means?
[time=2224] Do not love the world.
[time=2227] Well I gave you a definition here, it would be a great small group discussion to just start
[time=2233] hashing that out, but let me just tell you what we found here.
[time=2236] The invisible system, this is what it is, the word is cosmos, cosmos and the Greek,
[time=2242] and the definition is this my friends, when John says to you and I do not love the world,
[time=2248] he is talking about the invisible system of evil that dominates and infiltrates all of
[time=2255] culture, society and mankind.
[time=2259] The world is Satan's philosophy.
[time=2263] Stop right there for a moment.
[time=2264] The world, when you see that phrase of the world, that's Satan's philosophy.
[time=2267] Well what Satan's philosophy, well what do you mean Satan's philosophy?
[time=2270] Well you know, a Satan's philosophy would be how Satan thinks, it would be what Satan
[time=2276] values, it would be Satan's mindset, it would be all that Satan believes to be true and right and good, Satan's philosophy.
[time=2285] This invisible system that's permeated all of this world and moved into the hearts and
[time=2294] minds of people and our culture, it's Satan's philosophy and all that he offers, and you
[time=2301] and I know because the scriptures teach, that all that he offers is in what?
[time=2306] That opposition to God and God's word, the world is Satan's philosophy.
[time=2312] And all that he offers in direct opposition to God and God's word, it's important that
[time=2319] you understand this morning my friends, that when you hear John say to us do not love the world, he's not talking about a place, he's not talking about Las Vegas, he's not talking
[time=2332] about the earth, he's not a physical reality, it's a spiritual reality, he says do not love
[time=2339] the world, cosmos, it's not necessarily people.
[time=2345] I know that there are people that you and I see doing things that are ungodly, I know
[time=2351] you and I see people doing things that are contrary to God, in opposition to him, they're
[time=2359] not the world, they're broken people, the world is the system that they've bought into,
[time=2368] it's the way of thinking that they've adopted, that they live by, the world is all that is against or all that is apart from what's true, what's right and good, the world, if
[time=2379] you love the world, the scriptures here in first John are teaching, that you have an affection and a devotion to things that are opposed to him, you have an affection and
[time=2390] a devotion to thinking and activity that is contrary to God.
[time=2397] Do you love the world?
[time=2403] Do you have an affection or a devotion?
[time=2406] Watch this now.
[time=2407] The world shows itself, the world, satanic philosophy, evil thinking that which is opposed to God
[time=2416] shows itself blatantly, doesn't it, doesn't it, shows itself blatantly, more blatantly,
[time=2427] more overtly today than ever before and it will get more overt, I bet.
[time=2435] The world shows itself blatantly, do you love greed, do you love illicit sexual activity,
[time=2443] do you love illicit sexual activity, sexual activity outside of God's design for sexual
[time=2449] activity and that takes place publicly and that even takes place privately, do you love greed, do you love illicit sexual activity, do you love power, do you love prestige, do
[time=2459] you love materialism, I mean I could go on and on with the overt, blatant expressions
[time=2469] of philosophy and thinking that's apart from God, but here's what I want you to remember
[time=2475] this morning, there is also a covert expression and the covert in some ways is almost even
[time=2484] more deadly because it's covert, because there isn't anything, there isn't anything inherently
[time=2490] wrong with the cults, I only like the cults but I live in Indiana now so I'm okay with
[time=2499] going with the cults, you know, some would say it's better than liking the raiders which I do still but that's a different story, nothing wrong with the cults, there's nothing wrong with hunting, there's nothing wrong with your home, there's nothing wrong with
[time=2517] a hobby, is there, not your heads, nothing wrong, but if you spend millions and millions
[time=2528] of dollars or millions and millions of hours or millions of millions of energy, if good things in and of themselves all of a sudden capture your affection and your devotion
[time=2541] and now you are hog wild crazy after this thing that's inherently not evil but now all of a sudden you know what, it's become what, it's become evil because now it separates you and moves you away from that way, your energy gets zapped, your resources get zapped,
[time=2557] your perspective gets zapped because you're just absolutely fanatical about this instead
[time=2563] of being fanatical about him, the world, Colossians 1, 3 calls it the domain of darkness and
[time=2574] in Ephesians 2, 1 to 3, turn there if you would and Ephesians 2, 1 to 3, Paul describes
[time=2580] it the world as the course of this world, the course of this world and those of us that
[time=2586] know him, those of us that know the Lord, have a relationship with him, there was a day when
[time=2592] we didn't and this is how we lived, Ephesians 2, 1 and you were dead in your trespasses
[time=2599] and sins and it goes on in verse 2 to say in which you formally walked according to the
[time=2605] course of this world, cosmos and what's the course of this world according to the prince
[time=2611] when you walk and live according to the course of this world, you're living according to
[time=2617] the prince of the power of the heir who is who, Satan, Paul goes on to say of the spirit
[time=2626] that is now working in the sons of disobedience and in verse 3 he says among them we too all
[time=2632] used to live, we formerly lived in the lusts here it is, the lusts of the flesh indulging
[time=2638] the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature, in that state we were by nature, children of wrath even as the rest, even as the rest, John warns us my friends,
[time=2656] don't, don't love, I kind of did that I'm sorry, I don't think John, I don't think
[time=2663] John's doing that, I think John's, I think John's bagging you, I think he's on his knees,
[time=2673] waving the biggest red flag he can wave, I don't think he's wagging his finger in your face, I think he's begging you to please not love affection devotion, what's evil,
[time=2688] don't give your affection or devotion away to anything that opposes God, don't forget James 4-4, it's a great verse, it's a little hard to read sometimes but there it is, James
[time=2701] says you adulterous adultery, adultery is when one spouse is on what, say it louder, faithful.
[time=2713] This is about faithfulness my friends, in essence John is saying don't have an affair
[time=2719] on God, don't go give yourself to some cheap substitute that won't last and it'll never
[time=2728] work out, it won't be what you thought it was going to be, don't do that, don't cheat on God, don't be an adulterous, he says you unfaithful people, do you not know that friendship
[time=2742] with the world, that friendship with the world is hostility toward God and see the answer
[time=2748] is that most of us in the room and most people who this relates to would say no, I didn't know that because that's not the message the enemy tells you, the enemy communicates a message to you and I that says friendship with the world is just fun, it's okay, it's
[time=2765] just you feeling better, it's just you getting some relief, it's just you numbing the pain, it's just you getting away from that which is difficult, the enemy just says it again and again and again, it's not a big deal, it's just this, when the reality is it's not
[time=2780] just this, that is hostility, hatred of God because God didn't design that for you, God
[time=2792] designed this for you, a Christ, a Lord and Savior who fights for you, lives in you, protects
[time=2801] and gives guidance, friendship with the world, hostility toward God therefore whoever wishes
[time=2808] to be a friend of the world makes himself a what, an enemy of God.
[time=2818] This is a warning my friends, how do you respond different, there's different ones of you in
[time=2824] the room today, different personalities, I love kind of watching people, I love studying
[time=2830] folks in their response, how do you respond to a warning, how many, how many put on the,
[time=2841] how many of you in the room put your foot on the gas when you see a yellow light, you
[time=2850] know what I mean, I'm just asking you to think about it, how do you respond to a warning,
[time=2858] it's your, what's your make up, it's cautious, are you a play by the rules kind of person,
[time=2865] someone in authority, someone in your life says hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, and they give you a little, well how do you respond, you know I'll just tell you one of the greatest joys, may not seem like a big deal to some, many of you in the room will understand this, one of the greatest joys that Kebra and I experience as parents and
[time=2888] some of you will definitely identify this is when we've given a warning, when we have
[time=2894] for whatever reason said whoa, hey, hey, hey, listen, you better think about what you're
[time=2903] about to do, when we, and then you realize we're dealing with 15 to 6, so we're dealing
[time=2911] with hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you better think about what you're doing, we're dealing with
[time=2917] that on this end, you know, what you saw this morning, you know, culture today with students
[time=2924] and good but you know, life changing decisions that are having to be made, you know, we're
[time=2931] dealing with that, and we're dealing with don't touch the burner on the stove, right?
[time=2937] But either way, either way, there is just nothing that is this sweet, especially when
[time=2945] you've been working at it and you've been trying to make an investment when you say, hey, hey, young man or young lady, hey, you need to back up or you need to step away,
[time=2956] you know, step away from the cliff, or you need to slow down, you need to think about
[time=2963] what you're about to do, and 15 or 6, most of you know that they're going 1,000 miles an hour, you know, they're just walking 1,000 miles an hour down, actually, I'm not walking right, actually, they're walking 1,000 miles an hour, you're sounding the warning, and they're walking 1,000 miles an hour, am I right, they're just kind of walking like this
[time=2984] because they got it figured out, and you're giving them the warning, and so many times it's just like, you know, like that, 6-year-old, 15-year-old, and one of the coolest things
[time=2995] I didn't know how to illustrate this other than to just do it, one of the coolest things on the world is to, as you are in that relationship with them and you sound the warning, you know, to watch them kind of doing their thing, and you sound that warning and then it's like this, right, anybody feeling that, it's amazing, and whether it's just a hand coming away
[time=3036] from the oven or a really potentially bad decision that was going to get made, God gives
[time=3047] us these privileged opportunities to waive these really, really big red flags, and He
[time=3055] is waiving that flag to you in this room this morning. Do you love the world? Here's the
[time=3071] declaration, it's a little hard here, my friends, but it's the truth, so we've got to say it.
[time=3080] If anybody in the room answered yes to that. Now, remember, it's 1 John, we're not talking
[time=3087] about do you struggle with it? Everybody, if we're talking about do you struggle with loving the world, my hand is the first one up, and it's quickly and it's high. What
[time=3100] 1 John is talking about is the pattern and condition of the pattern and then the consistency
[time=3106] of your heart is your heart consistently, again and again and again and again and again, affectionate
[time=3113] and devoted to the world, do you again and again and again with great consistency and
[time=3121] with great determination, posture your heart towards those things which are contrary to God. If you do, you love the world, and if anyone loves the world back to verse 15, if
[time=3133] anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in Him.
[time=3143] If the consistent pattern of love, we're talking about a test of love here, if the consistent
[time=3149] pattern of love is love for what is evil, if the consistent pattern of love is love for what is contrary to God, then you don't love God. And here's where I bear with me here.
[time=3166] Here's where I feel myself departing right here at this point, is where I feel myself
[time=3173] departing from what many Christian teachers and leaders or pastors would say at this point
[time=3181] in the message. Because I believe many would in essence say that if you answer that question,
[time=3188] yes, I love the world. Yes, I consistently am giving my affection and devotion to that
[time=3195] which is contrary to God. Many of them would wag their fingers in your face and say, shame on you. Shame on you for loving sin more than righteousness. Shame on you for all your futile
[time=3208] empty pursuits and addictions. Shame on you for loving the world and while believe me, believe me, I understand that you are culpable if in fact you do as am I. I understand there's choices that you make and sometimes there's choices you shouldn't make and you have to be as do I held accountable for those. While I understand that, as the years go by, I've
[time=3230] begun to see that really there might be, there might be some shame on the church going
[time=3237] on here. And when I say shame on the church, I'll just, I'll just own this, really shame on those, shame on those who teach and lead. Let me try and explain this to you. Which message,
[time=3253] which message has been clearer? Which message has been most consistent? Which message has
[time=3261] been most compelling? The world's message, describing and inviting people to the lust
[time=3269] of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, has that been, has that been the clearest, most consistent, most compelling message that you've heard or has
[time=3281] it been the church's message? Describing and inviting people, describing and inviting
[time=3289] people to God, to the message of Him, a message describing the thrill and in the enjoyment
[time=3297] of the King, which has been more compelling, which has been more consistent, the message describing the allurement of sin or the message of Christ, the message of truth. Who's had
[time=3315] the better commercials? Who? The world or the church? Go ahead, answer the world. I think
[time=3331] that in many respects we have done a lousy job of promoting God. I think at times we've
[time=3339] done a lousy job of putting God on display. I think at times with young people and older
[time=3347] people and middle-aged people, we've done a lousy job of putting God in all of His attributes
[time=3353] and all of His glory and all that there is about Him that really is true and right and good. I think there have been times where we've done a lousy job of inviting people to a life
[time=3365] in relationship with Him whereby they can experience and see in the everyday of life the absolute
[time=3372] utter joy of knowing Him, absolute utter joy that goes far beyond the click of a mouse,
[time=3381] that goes far beyond the size of a home, that goes far beyond how many companies you own,
[time=3389] that goes far beyond the name, on the tags, on the clothes that you are. I want to do
[time=3395] a better job. I want you to help me do a better job of putting our great and glorious and
[time=3403] majestic and unbelievable God on display. It's like C.S. Lewis used to say the little
[time=3411] one who basked in the excitement of playing in a puddle because he'd never seen the ocean
[time=3417] yet. I want to help people see the glory and the reality and the beauty and the awesomeness
[time=3426] and the thrill of a God who loves them deeply. As the team comes up to lead us in Christ
[time=3437] alone and as you prepare to lift your voices in proclamation of that great truth, I want
[time=3444] to remind you this morning. I want to remind you of what a privilege it is for us. What
[time=3452] a privilege it is for us to know Him. I want to remind you this morning of the fact that
[time=3460] in all that we've discussed today, my friends, it is only in intimacy with Christ that you
[time=3469] and I stand a chance. You and I shy of a relationship with Him that is growing and personal and intimate.
[time=3479] And I of that, you and I will get our clocks clean.
