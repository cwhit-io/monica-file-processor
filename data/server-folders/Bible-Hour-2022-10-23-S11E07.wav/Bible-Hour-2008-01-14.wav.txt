[time=311] All right.
[time=318] Well hello again everybody, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=323] It's great to have you with us again, and I come to you this morning in a little bit more of a casual look than normal.
[time=331] I know I'm not dressed up ever really, but today's especially casual because I've got my baptism shirt on.
[time=339] We're about to do here this morning in our worship services, four or five baptisms.
[time=344] And I've got the shirt on, and it's a reminder to me whenever I am preparing to go into that water and be with those people,
[time=353] it's a reminder to me of why we do what we do.
[time=357] Why we do Black Hawk Ministries, why we do the Bible Hour, why we work so hard and give so much of our time and effort
[time=365] to communicate this life-saving, life-transforming message.
[time=370] And the reason is that very thing, we believe that God is about transforming and changing people's lives.
[time=377] And every time I stand in the water with folks who come to be baptized, to publicly proclaim their love for the Lord,
[time=386] to publicly stand there in those waters and share with our people their story of life change.
[time=393] Every time I do it, I am reminded that really, fundamentally, it is what we're about, trying our best to be priests.
[time=402] Priests who having met with God then carry God along, pass God along to others so that those others, whoever they may be,
[time=411] so that their hearts and lives can be changed and transformed by His amazing grace.
[time=417] I want to just encourage you, I know there are some of you out there and you're in the process of being transformed.
[time=424] You listen to the broadcast, you come and you spend this time with us each and every week and our hope is that the Scripture,
[time=432] our hope is that the Word of God and the great truth in it is being allowed by you to change the way you think
[time=439] and the way you function, the way you choose, our hope is that this ministry is a transforming ministry for you.
[time=447] And I want to just encourage you to keep listening.
[time=449] I want to encourage you to keep asking those spiritual questions that I know many of you are asking.
[time=455] And I also want to encourage you to not travel this road alone.
[time=459] You know, we would love to meet you. We would love to spend time with you.
[time=463] We would love to, while you are being transformed, we'd love to connect you with people who truly and genuinely care about you.
[time=471] So come see us sometime. Come on a Sunday morning, 9 or 1045.
[time=476] This is a safe place for you to hear a life-changing, life-transforming message.
[time=483] We can't wait to meet you. We're thankful for you.
[time=486] And I hope today as you watch the broadcast, I hope you would just open your heart to what it is God might have for you today.
[time=492] We think what He has for you will change you forever.
[time=498] Hey, God bless you. Thanks for tuning in. Have a great week, and we hope to see you soon.
[time=522] (Music)
[time=990] Well, hey, I want to welcome you back to our study of first John, and it has been a great study. I'm so thankful for the, thankful for the feedback and the notes and the emails that I get from so many of you.
[time=1004] What is most encouraging to me is that you're, what's most encouraging to me is that God's taking this effort and God's doing something special with it in your heart, and in your mind and soul, and I'm very thankful for that.
[time=1018] If you've been with us at all, you know that first John is a powerful book that addresses really a very, very powerful, very, very pertinent issue, and that is the issue of the genuineness of your faith.
[time=1035] We're riding to school Monday morning, this past week, and I got to give you a little bit of backdrop. My youngest son, Jake, is seven, and it was about a year ago, and I think when you think back to a year on this subject, you'll kind of understand maybe how this all plays out, but it was about a year ago, maybe a year and a half ago, back in the fall, all of a sudden Jake became an enormous Indianapolis Colts fan.
[time=1064] It was amazing. Everything in his room started to be cults this and cults that, and really, in particular, he became obsessed with, and just the number one fan of Peyton Manning.
[time=1076] He asked me about Peyton Manning probably every night. He wanted to pray for Peyton Manning. He wanted to meet Peyton Manning. He wanted to Peyton Manning went to church and worship God.
[time=1085] He had all kinds of questions for Peyton Manning. He wanted a Peyton Manning jersey. He wanted a Peyton Manning poster. He wanted Peyton Manning everything, and he didn't get everything, but he got a lot of it, and all of a sudden, my son Jake was just immersed in the world of rooting for and pulling for and being the biggest Peyton Manning fan you could ever believe.
[time=1108] So, Monday morning, we're driving to school. All the kids packed in there. I hear a little Jake from the back. Hey Dad, I'm like, "Yeah, Jake, could I get a Brett Favre jersey?"
[time=1127] So, here's my point. My son failed the test. My son failed the test as to whether he was a genuine Peyton Manning follower.
[time=1144] And first John, my friends, has been about a series of tests trying to help you determine and see the genuineness of your faith, because there were people in Ephesus and in the region surrounding Ephesus who were raising their hand saying, "I love Peyton Manning. I love Jesus," they were saying.
[time=1166] A lot of people in that day proclaiming to be followers of Christ, proclaiming to have a genuineness to their faith, and yet what John knew, what God knew, and what John was beginning to see in here was that their faith was by no means genuine, that heresy, false teaching about their faith had crept in.
[time=1190] They started to muddy the spiritual climate and water of that place and that day, and there were people who were claiming to know Christ, who didn't.
[time=1202] And there are people today. And I'm always very careful here. Most of you know me, and you know me well enough to know that I'm very, very, I rarely, people write in all the time.
[time=1214] People call in all the time. People email me all the time. People stop me in the mall, and they want to know.
[time=1222] They want to know, if so and so does this, Pastor Kelly, do you think they're really what? Saved?
[time=1229] People are always wanting to assess other people's salvation or the validity of it, and I'm just telling you, I've always been extremely careful with this.
[time=1240] I rarely answer that question, but I'll tell you what, the Word of God speaks to this issue, and if the Word of God speaks to it, then I think we owe it to ourselves to proclaim it.
[time=1257] And the clear Word of God is that as it relates to genuine faith, there is a test. There is a test of the proper view of Christ.
[time=1269] Back to our study, first John chapter 1. There is a test of the proper view of Christ. We saw that in those initial verses there in chapter 1. There is the test of obedience.
[time=1280] God's Word says that if you know Him, and if you genuinely love Him, your life will be marked by perfection. No, no, your life will be marked by a pattern of obedience.
[time=1293] You will be known for, you will be marked by, you will be characterized as one who wants to obey. You won't always.
[time=1303] God knew that. John knew that. That's why 1 John 1.9 says that when you confess your what? Your sin. He's faithful and just to forgive you.
[time=1311] He knew you were going to sin. He's not talking about perfection. He's saying the pattern of your life, the consistent quality of your heart will be one that wants to obey, and that person knows the Lord.
[time=1325] And the one who doesn't want to, the one who's hard-hearted and cold-hearted and stubborn and rebellious as a pattern again and again and again saying I don't want to obey.
[time=1337] This person has some, this person has some things to think through. There is this test of a proper view of Christ. There is this test of obedience.
[time=1345] Then we come in our study of 1 John to this test, this third test of love. God's Word through the pen of John here and in so many other places that we've seen lifts up this decision, this choice, not an emotion, not a feeling, this decision, this choice that we make to love.
[time=1368] To show member last week, affection and devotion. Selflessness. Agape is the word. And God's Word says again and again that if you know me, you will love me and you won't just love me.
[time=1380] No, the test of love is clear that when you and I, if we genuinely know him, love him, express and communicate and bring to him our affection and our devotion and our commitment and our sacrifice.
[time=1395] When we offer him our love and live in a love relationship with him, we can't help but then out of that love relationship with him, love who? Others. You will love others.
[time=1407] You will agape others. You will sacrificially and affectionately and with great devotion, give yourself to others when you know him.
[time=1417] Because if you know him, you love him and if you love him, you love them. It's just how it is.
[time=1424] So in this test of love, it has been all about what we are to love. We are to love God and love others. Now we come to verse 15, 16, 17, last week we got here.
[time=1437] And we see now a new focus still in this test of love. Now it's about what we don't love.
[time=1445] My friends, we saw last week that as a follower of Christ, you are told by God to not love something.
[time=1455] If you know him and if you are knowing him is genuine and real, you won't love Satan's philosophy.
[time=1465] You won't love the enemy's values. You won't love anything that is, how do we say it?
[time=1473] Contrary or opposed to God and his truth, you won't. You won't love anything that's up against and contrary to what's good and right and true.
[time=1484] The Scriptures call that, but what? The world.
[time=1488] In honor of God's word, would you stand? And let me read this to you this morning, 1 John chapter 2 verses 15 to 17. Do you love the world?
[time=1499] Verse 15 says, "Do not love the world, do not love the world, nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him, for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[time=1516] and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but is from the world, and the world is passing away.
[time=1526] And the world is passing away, and also it's lust, but the one who does the will of God lives forever.
[time=1537] A warning, a declaration, a prediction, and a promise that you and I need to understand as we live daily in the midst of the world.
[time=1552] Father, God, we stand humbly before you, asking you again, God, to please, oh, please, through your spirit and through your word.
[time=1562] God expand our hearts and minds this morning, bring conviction where it's needed. God timely reminders where we need to see it.
[time=1570] God new learnings and new fresh understanding that will transform and change our hearts and minds.
[time=1577] God, we beg you to do this, and we commit to open our hearts this morning, God, with great humility, with great humility,
[time=1588] with an honest and sincere transparency, God, and a hunger for you, a hunger for you to do your life-changing work in us.
[time=1597] Thank you for the privilege of being here and for the privilege of opening up your word in your son's name we pray.
[time=1603] Amen, you can be seated. So last week we looked briefly and let me just quickly kind of go back over the warning.
[time=1611] There was a very severe, very strong, very bright yellow flag that John waves here to all those who profess to know him,
[time=1619] and the warning is stated right there in verse 15. Do not love the world and don't love the things that are of the world.
[time=1628] Don't love the world. We talked about affection and devotion, affection, a longing for, a passionate desire, you being excited about,
[time=1637] you longing for that which is opposed to God. Devotion, affection, devotion, devotion speaks to the commitment and the consistency of that affection.
[time=1649] And then John says to believers, then, and he says to believers now, do not love the world.
[time=1656] It is a very strong and very clear and very, very to the point warning.
[time=1664] And then we got into at the end of our time last week the declaration, and it is a very clear, very pointed, very unambiguous declaration, my friends.
[time=1675] And it deals with both the overt loving of the world and the covert loving of the world.
[time=1683] It is a declaration that deals with the blatant loving of the world that you and I can at times be a part of and it deals with the subtle loving of the world that we can fall into.
[time=1697] It is a clear and strong powerful declaration found right there at the end of verse 15.
[time=1705] Verse 15 says don't love the world. If here it is, if anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[time=1713] If you love the stuff that's opposed to God, John says you don't love God.
[time=1722] And this is the illicit, dark, seedy, overt, immoral stuff that we're tempted with again and again and again.
[time=1734] This is the subtle stuff. This is a harmless hobby. This is selling baskets. This is playing golf.
[time=1746] This is killing. This is just anything that in and of itself isn't evil.
[time=1752] It's just that when you and I throw ourselves so completely into it and we start spending in ordinate amounts of time and in ordinate amounts of money and in ordinate amounts of energy on these things.
[time=1763] All of a sudden they become a distraction. All of a sudden they become a roadblock. All of a sudden they get set up as gods.
[time=1774] And he says don't do that. He says don't love the world. He says you're not a child of God if you possess an increasing pattern of affection and devotion to the world.
[time=1787] You guys hear something? Anybody hear anything up there?
[time=1795] At first I thought it was rain and I was like that's too cold a rain. Sounds like something anyway. They'll try and fix it.
[time=1807] It sounds pretty bad so if you guys can do something up there that'd be great. There you go. Thank you.
[time=1818] So he says don't love the world. Last week this is where I said most preachers, a lot of teachers that maybe you've grown up with at this point would start wagging their finger in your face saying shame on you for love in the world.
[time=1831] And I want to say something about that because last week what I said was I'm not so sure that all the blame should be placed on you or your struggles with or your choices to love the world.
[time=1847] In fact I begin to talk about some of the responsibility I think that we have as the church. But let me come back to you while I don't know that all the blame should be on you.
[time=1858] There are many of you in the room and you do know better.
[time=1864] I don't want to take more of that heat off you than I should.
[time=1869] So while I'm not in the finger wagging and saying shame on you there are some in the room you're loving the world today.
[time=1877] Your affections and your devotions are clearly aimed at it and you know better.
[time=1887] And I just hope that as you think this through and as you open your heart and your spirit today to what God's Word has to say I hope you'll give thought to that.
[time=1899] There are some in the room who need to confess that you love the world and for some of you it's the overt stuff and for others of you it's the subtle stuff.
[time=1911] But your love and your devotion and your affection is not aimed clearly at him.
[time=1920] Now back to what I also said last week and that is that I do believe at the same time that there is some responsibility on people like me and others who teach and communicate this truth.
[time=1933] And I feel as if as I look back over the last 20 years of my life in ministry I feel like there have been times where I have done a poor job of putting on display for people the great glory and majesty the great thrill and excitement of knowing him and serving him and living life with him his way.
[time=1958] I sensed I said last week I sensed at times that the enemy was doing a better job of promoting and inviting people to the empty pleasures of sin and the world doing a better job of that than the church has done in promoting and inviting people to the lasting pleasures of righteousness
[time=1980] and relationship with God I said the world's had better commercials the world's had better commercials constantly communicating the excitement and the thrill of sin.
[time=1994] Now what I didn't mean by that is I don't think we need to get in the commercial business I really don't I don't feel as if we need to compete on the on the glitzy thrill level.
[time=2005] I'm not suggesting that what I'm suggesting is that what we need to communicate and what we need to teach and what you and I need to live is the absolute joy and the depth of satisfaction found and knowing and loving and serving Christ.
[time=2020] When you and I put Christ on display when you and I teach and proclaim the great truth of life and relationship with Christ which doesn't bring with it a lot of the immediate gain and immediate gratification that the world's commercials talk about and invite you to know a commercial about Christ you and I promoting him you and I sharing him you and I proclaiming the great joy the deep joy of knowing him that oftentimes requires sacrifice.
[time=2049] That oftentimes requires waiting.
[time=2056] That oftentimes requires self control.
[time=2058] That oftentimes requires having to put off the immediate gain for future reward.
[time=2064] Think about all those people in Hebrews who died without receiving their promise knowing that their promise was that which awaited them where in glory.
[time=2073] I want us to do a great job of promoting in appropriate ways because I think it is this.
[time=2083] I think it's thrilling.
[time=2084] I've learned.
[time=2085] I'm 44.
[time=2086] I've got some more years to go.
[time=2087] I've got some more lessons to learn.
[time=2089] But I've been here and I know what's thrilling.
[time=2094] I know now what satisfies.
[time=2098] I know what's gratifying.
[time=2103] And it's not the cheap imitation that the world offers you and I.
[time=2108] It is the person of Christ and meaningful relationship with him.
[time=2113] Amen?
[time=2114] That's it.
[time=2116] And that's what I want us to do a better job of.
[time=2120] You have to remember this.
[time=2122] It's important.
[time=2123] Some of you might just be learning this.
[time=2127] Others of you know this.
[time=2128] I understand.
[time=2129] Others of you may just be learning this and I want you to understand what kind of goes on behind the scenes on this thing.
[time=2134] As we talk about what Satan offers you, as we talk about what Satan offers me, when we talk about what God offers us in Christ and how all that works, I want you to know this.
[time=2148] Satan is acutely aware. He is not Satan is not all knowing.
[time=2152] There is only one who is all knowing, right?
[time=2155] Satan, though, is pretty bright.
[time=2158] He's pretty clever.
[time=2160] And he has a great deal of understanding.
[time=2162] And Satan is acutely aware of how God made you, how God designed you.
[time=2167] Satan's very clear about the fact that you were put together with an enormous capacity to be thrilled, to be wowed, to be excited, to be stirred.
[time=2177] And he knows, because of what he's aware of, that you and I were designed by God to be excited and to be stirred and to be wowed and to be thrilled by who.
[time=2187] God.
[time=2190] Yeah, wowed, excited, stirred, those aren't bad things.
[time=2193] Don't let anybody ever tell you that those are things you and I were designed to be.
[time=2198] What I'm talking about there is being filled up, satisfied, truly.
[time=2203] We were designed by God to be stirred up and wowed and filled by him.
[time=2210] So Satan, back to Satan, knowing that we've been left vulnerable by sin, Genesis 3.
[time=2218] Before Genesis 3, we weren't vulnerable. Before Genesis 3, we were perfect.
[time=2222] We lived in perfect relationship with God.
[time=2224] Genesis 3 comes, Adam, Eve, the fruit, the serpent, and all of a sudden, boom, we're busted.
[time=2231] We're broken vessels, redeemed and saved.
[time=2235] Yes, now, but still, never quite all the way there until that day when we are with him in glory.
[time=2241] That's when we get to be perfect again.
[time=2244] So until then, there's these defects, there's these deficiencies, there's this struggle.
[time=2250] And knowing that we've been left vulnerable, Satan, back to his commercial, he stops at nothing
[time=2257] to thrill, wow, and excite and fill us with evil.
[time=2263] Blatant and subtle, sexually illicit and the evil that can come from a harmless hobby.
[time=2271] And I want us to remember the great truth of Psalm 4-7.
[time=2275] Write that down, Psalm 4-7.
[time=2277] So thankful, I found this last week.
[time=2281] You, it's a great declaration for you and I to just remember this.
[time=2286] To just be able to say like the psalmist.
[time=2289] You, Lord, he's speaking to you here.
[time=2292] He's crying out to God, saying you have put gladness in my what?
[time=2297] Say it in my heart.
[time=2299] Who's put gladness?
[time=2302] Did the bottle put gladness in the heart?
[time=2316] What?
[time=2317] Who or what put gladness, joy, exceeding joy in the heart?
[time=2322] Who, God?
[time=2324] The Lord put gladness in my heart.
[time=2327] More than, I love that, more than.
[time=2330] You want to compare fine more than when their grain and new wine abound.
[time=2338] There isn't anything you're going to attain.
[time=2343] There isn't anybody that you're going to date.
[time=2345] There isn't any experience of pleasure that you're going to have.
[time=2349] Nothing will surpass the joy and the fulfillment that comes when he puts gladness in your heart
[time=2359] because you love him.
[time=2363] Not the world.
[time=2365] Psalm 47, don't forget that.
[time=2367] Here's the prediction, my friends.
[time=2369] There's the warning.
[time=2371] There's the declaration.
[time=2373] Number three, the prediction.
[time=2374] Look with me back to our passage in 1 John 2 verses 16 and the first part of 17.
[time=2380] For all that is, he says, don't love the world.
[time=2383] If you do, you don't love God.
[time=2386] And then he says in verse 16, for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father but is from the world.
[time=2398] And speaking of the world, he says in 17, it's passing away.
[time=2404] It's passing away.
[time=2408] John here imploring these people to move away from the lust of the flesh so many places.
[time=2415] In the scriptures where we see God's authors doing the very same thing.
[time=2420] Let me just show you one.
[time=2421] Can I go to Romans 13?
[time=2425] Turn in your Bibles to Romans 13.
[time=2427] Look with me at verses 11 through 14.
[time=2431] Romans 13, 11 through 14.
[time=2435] Paul here writing to the church at Rome.
[time=2437] He says, do this.
[time=2439] Do this knowing the time.
[time=2442] Paul says, be aware of your circumstance, church.
[time=2445] And be aware of the fact that you don't have all the time in the world.
[time=2450] No, your days are short.
[time=2452] That the time is knowing the time that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep.
[time=2460] For now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed.
[time=2464] The night is almost gone and the day is near.
[time=2467] Therefore let us lay aside, very important concept there where it says lay aside.
[time=2473] That verb there in the Greek has to do with disrobing.
[time=2477] That verb there, that phrase in the Greek has to do with you and I just taking off and throwing away,
[time=2484] discarding anything on us that's soiled.
[time=2487] Anything on us that's dirty.
[time=2489] Anything on us that would encumber or keep us from walking or better said running this race
[time=2496] that God has laid out before us.
[time=2498] He says the night is almost gone, the day is near.
[time=2500] So hey, let's get serious here.
[time=2504] Let's get focused.
[time=2506] You don't have all the time in the world.
[time=2508] No, the hour is at hand.
[time=2511] Lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
[time=2517] Let us behave properly.
[time=2522] Now Grandpa Joe, I've told you about Joe Jackson before.
[time=2528] Deaf, couldn't hear from the time he was 19.
[time=2533] Expert lip reader, he busted me from across the room many a day.
[time=2539] And he used to always talk really loud, I've told you this before.
[time=2542] He talked really loud because he couldn't hear himself and Grandma would always tell him to kind of take it down and he'd always blow her off and he'd just talk loud.
[time=2550] He'd always ask me when he'd see me.
[time=2552] KB, KB, how was your conduct?
[time=2559] How was your conduct?
[time=2560] He'd say, let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity
[time=2572] and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy, but put on.
[time=2577] Remember back in verse 12, we took off, we laid aside, we stripped ourselves of that which was not of him
[time=2585] and then it says here to put on.
[time=2589] To get rid of all that stuff and put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.
[time=2599] Do you see that?
[time=2602] That's a very, very, leave that up there.
[time=2605] And I just want you to see that as it relates to this battle, as it relates to the war that's being waged against you
[time=2614] by the enemy who wants to destroy you.
[time=2618] God's Word says to you this morning, look at that, make no what?
[time=2627] Now come on, how many provisions, somebody might be saying, okay, what's a provision?
[time=2633] I sense this is important, but I don't know what you mean, a provision.
[time=2637] What he's saying is don't leave an open door.
[time=2643] How many open doors are you and I leaving open for the flesh?
[time=2653] And where we go and what we watch and listen to and what we do and what we allow ourselves to indulge in.
[time=2662] God's Word says this is serious, the day is coming, make no provision.
[time=2670] Don't leave any open doors.
[time=2675] Go to great lengths, he says, to guard yourself from that which would move you away from.
[time=2681] Stir your heart and move you away from that which is right.
[time=2685] Lust.
[time=2687] Lust, back to our passage, the lust, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the boastful pride of life.
[time=2692] Just quickly here for you this morning, lust, strong, internal desire for evil.
[time=2697] Write that down, the strong, internal desire for evil, evil of all kinds.
[time=2703] This is lust, and it comes from the flesh. Write that down, man's sinful nature.
[time=2708] We often think of our flesh, flesh, flesh, and while it includes the members of our body, it goes much deeper.
[time=2714] The flesh is the sinful nature, back to Genesis 3, when that took place.
[time=2719] Even though God brought salvation, even though God brought redemption, there is between now and heaven this nature in us that is sinful.
[time=2728] That left to itself on its own is going to move away from that which is right and good.
[time=2733] That's your sinful nature.
[time=2736] The flesh, the lust of the flesh, he says there.
[time=2741] The lust of strong, internal desire, lust, the lust of the eyes, the flesh, very general, very broad.
[time=2752] He's talking about the lust of the flesh, the lust of your and I, sinful nature, very general, very broad.
[time=2757] Then he says the lust of the eyes, and here my friends, write it down.
[time=2761] He gets very specific.
[time=2763] Here he paints a very specific picture, and the specific picture that he paints is this,
[time=2769] and go ahead and just allow yourself to kind of entertain this for a moment.
[time=2772] I don't want you dwelling here long, but think about this.
[time=2775] Satan oftentimes, and I read this here in my notes, I read this in every other commentator I looked at this week,
[time=2782] and here John talks about how Satan oftentimes introduces evil through what we see.
[time=2792] Through your eyes.
[time=2795] Think of the times that you've sinned.
[time=2798] Think of the times that he's introduced you to evil, and he's done so by virtue of what you looked at.
[time=2809] Think of how visual we are.
[time=2813] It always makes me laugh. People say men are visual.
[time=2818] What, like women aren't?
[time=2822] And there may be some differences there, but let's just be honest.
[time=2827] Ladies, men, boys, girls, grandmas and grandpas, we can be captivated by what we see.
[time=2836] And if we're not, I remember the song as a kid, be careful little what?
[time=2840] Be careful little eyes. What you see?
[time=2844] The lust of the eyes. You and me.
[time=2849] A passing glance, or hold up in some dark room with a mouse and a computer screen.
[time=2857] What we see oftentimes Satan introduces us and begins to pull us away from evil.
[time=2863] Joshua 7, we won't delve into that.
[time=2868] But the whole story there in Joshua 7, let's just turn there briefly real quick.
[time=2874] Go to Joshua, that might even be on the screen. Joshua 720.
[time=2878] Is Joshua 720 up there?
[time=2881] Joshua 720, here we have the situation where God had told the Israelites as they went into Jericho.
[time=2888] He was going to give them Jericho.
[time=2892] There it is, so Aiken, he gives them Jericho, but he says to the people, don't take anything, right?
[time=2898] All the spoil, all the gold, all the silver, all the stuff you're going to see, right?
[time=2903] You're going to go into Jericho, I'm going to bring the walls down, you go in and take it, but don't take the stuff for yourself.
[time=2909] No, the stuff's going to go to me.
[time=2913] So Aiken, Aiken can't resist, they leave Jericho.
[time=2919] The next two battles go completely sideways, they get slaughtered, they're losing men.
[time=2924] Joshua can't figure out what's going on and God says, well, time out, somebody send.
[time=2930] Somebody took the stuff from Jericho and it's this guy Aiken.
[time=2935] So Joshua confronts Aiken, so Aiken answered Joshua and said, how many times have you said this?
[time=2940] How many times has this been true of you and me?
[time=2943] Joshua, yeah, so Aiken answered Joshua and said, truly I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and this is what I did.
[time=2950] Verse 21, when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinaar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold,
[time=2960] fifty shekels in weight and it goes on, then I coveted them and took them and behold they are concealed in the earth
[time=2969] inside my tent with the silver underneath it.
[time=2974] We see what we're not supposed to have and we take it because we want it and in the scene we get introduced to evil that we take
[time=2986] and when we take it we're done.
[time=2991] The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, it's kind of a progressive thing here, look where it ends my friends.
[time=2997] Look where this all leads you to and me, boastful pride of life.
[time=3003] It's what lust leads to.
[time=3006] And I tried to kind of whittle it down for you, simply said my friends and you can write this down, the pride of life is the arrogance.
[time=3013] The pride of life is arrogance with regard to personal circumstance.
[time=3019] Write that down, it's when you and I or anybody begins to experience this attitude of arrogance because of all the stuff
[time=3026] all the accomplishments, all the sin, whatever it might be, it's when it's basically look at me.
[time=3034] It's look at me, it's look at what I've done, it's look at what I've accomplished, it's look at what I have, it's look at me, look at my travel, look at my record, look at my bank account, look at me, the boastful pride of life as if you're someone.
[time=3053] And the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes only goes to enhance and deepen this boastful pride.
[time=3060] And here's what I want you to see this morning, please, please don't miss this, go back to our passage.
[time=3067] All of that, the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but it's from the world.
[time=3073] Here it is.
[time=3076] First part of 17 and the world is what? Say it out loud, passing away.
[time=3083] What does it mean, my friends, when it says all of that is passing away?
[time=3090] And you can write this down, what it means is that all of that ends up in hell.
[time=3099] That's where all of that lands.
[time=3105] And those who love that, those who are devoted to that, those who express affection and experience devotion, commitment in terms of consistency, those that love that end up there as well.
[time=3120] And that's a statement I don't say that lightly.
[time=3125] I say that because God's word says that if you love that stuff, it's passing away and so will you.
[time=3132] But, and I love this, I absolutely love this about our God.
[time=3140] But, back to 17, but the one who does the will of God, what's the will of God, the will of God is that you would love God and love others, the will of God is that you wouldn't love the world.
[time=3152] And the one who does the will of God lives what? Say it out loud.
[time=3157] Forever, back to the test of love. When you love God and others, you live.
[time=3164] When you place your affection and devotion in or on the world, you'll die.
[time=3171] He's reminding you here as he, as he winds up with this promise. He's reminding us that, that while the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes is short-lived and eternally empty, the one who is willing to choose and trust in God,
[time=3188] the one who chooses the will of God, not the will of man, not what feels good, not what makes sense to some, but the will of God for you, which you can know.
[time=3200] Which you can experience, the one who chooses the will of God will live forever.
[time=3205] Let me just say this to you as honestly and as lovingly and as pointedly and as sensitively as I can.
[time=3213] Whatever emptiness or pain, there are those of you in the room this morning and you are wracked with emptiness and pain.
[time=3222] And you feel it every day and it is eating away at you and whatever emptiness or pain you're trying to numb or remove by sinning, by going towards those things that are outside the will of God.
[time=3237] I just want to remind you this morning I tried to think of a profound way to say this, but I couldn't, so I'll just tell you, it won't work.
[time=3248] It doesn't work.
[time=3252] It leaves you empty and in pain.
[time=3258] Sin, my friend, this whole passage really as it winds up, it shows us the temporalness, the short-sightedness, the emptiness of sin.
[time=3268] It shows us the eternal lasting joy and favor of God in the eternal, the one who does the will of God.
[time=3276] Here's some questions for you, you don't even have to write them down, you can go to the website and get these questions.
[time=3281] This week I want you to think about these questions, you can write them down, but I'm just letting you know you can go to the website and retrieve these questions from our outline.
[time=3289] In what specific arena of your life are you loving something that is opposed to God in your vocational arena, in your marital arena, in your private arena, in your parenting arena, in every arena of your life, would you be willing to look at those arenas of your life and sincerely identify things?
[time=3310] That you're loving that are opposed to God.
[time=3315] What do you love that moves you away from God instead of closer to God?
[time=3320] What is it or who is it that you're loving, expressing and giving affection and devotion to that moves you away from God instead of closer to God?
[time=3332] Is there a harmless hobby or pursuit in your life that's become evil, not because it's evil, but because you've allowed it to look at that phrase, consume you?
[time=3345] I want to remind you this morning my friends that you were designed by God and Satan knows this and God knows this to be consumed with God, to be consumed with what's true and right.
[time=3361] Are you willing to break up? I just wrote that down and I guess I meant that originally when I wrote it I just kind of meant it figuratively, but it dawned on me first hour.
[time=3371] You know there may be somebody in here and what you're loving is a person and that person is opposed to God, that person is contrary to God, that person isn't good for you, they're not moving you closer to God, they're moving you further away from God.
[time=3387] And you may be in the room this morning giving your love, giving your heart and your affection and devotion to something that's not of God, and so I'm asking you, there's a lot on the line here.
[time=3398] Would you be willing to end that?
[time=3401] And then figuratively speaking would there be a willingness in you, others if you, maybe it's not a person but it's something else and you need to break up.
[time=3409] You need to say Adios, Amos 514, would you stand and we'll close with this, Amos 514, what a great, great passage, what a great verse, Amos 514, verse part of 15, seek good and not evil that you may what, say it out loud.
[time=3431] You want to live, I want you to live, seek good and not evil that you may live and thus may the Lord God of hosts be with you, just as you have said, look at verse 15, first part of 15, Amos 5, hate evil, love what, say it.
[time=3449] Oh Father God, may we be a people that love you and may we God be a people that hate evil, may we ask for whatever help we might need, may we seek out whatever accountability that we could benefit from.
[time=3464] Oh God, could we move away, please help us to move away from the world and toward you and God in loving you and knowing you, may we experience all the richness and the fullness of that which you offer in life and relationship with your son and everybody agreed and said, amen.
