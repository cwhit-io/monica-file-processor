[time=209] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=213] And as always, we're so thankful that you've tuned in and we look forward.
[time=217] Each and every week to spending this time with you, I wanted to just say a couple of words to you if I could before you see the rest of today's message and service.
[time=227] It's a time of year when oftentimes people, especially parents, begin to think about education
[time=233] for the coming year for their kids, whether your child is just entering into preschool, whether you're a little one or little ones or an elementary school, even junior high or high school.
[time=243] Oftentimes, this is the time when people begin to think about where that education process will
[time=250] take place. The kinds of people that are going to actually invest into the hearts and souls and lives
[time=256] of your children. And I want to just remind you of what a tremendous opportunity, what a really,
[time=262] really amazing gift God has given us here at Black Hawk in our school, Black Hawk Christian
[time=268] School. I am reminded every day, as my five kids come home from school, as I see the investment of
[time=276] truth and life and relationship that our faculty and staff are investing in them, as I see their
[time=282] academic progress going beyond what we ever imagined, as I see their spiritual lives growing
[time=288] each and every day, as I see the friendships that they're developing, the community of people that
[time=294] they're living and spending their lives with. It is an amazing, amazing gift. So I want to just encourage you. You can call our school office at the number here on the screen. Anybody there at
[time=305] the office would be more than happy to help get you in touch with the right people. You could come
[time=311] and take a tour. Your student could shadow one of our kids here during the day and get a feel for
[time=317] what life is like at BCS. We would do anything possible to help you better understand this
[time=324] incredible ministry and this incredible educational opportunity that God has given us. So give them a
[time=330] call at the school and give some thought to the education and spiritual investment that God can
[time=336] make in the hearts and lives of your kids. Hey, God bless you. We're thankful for you. Have a great week. And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=557] [MUSIC]
[time=577] [APPLAUSE]
[time=582] I was in, I think, I think it was in early December. Maybe you were here the morning when I was able to introduce to many of you a friend of ours, David Mupenda.
[time=593] And David's actually here this morning and I'm actually going to have David come up in a little bit, but first let me just kind of set the stage for you.
[time=600] I introduced David to you back in early mid-December.
[time=604] It was something that the elders felt like we should do. We don't do it all the time, but David was a part.
[time=608] He is a part of our family. He's part of this community of believers.
[time=612] David is a native brother who grew up in Africa and did ministry in the Congo and several years ago felt like it was so very important for him to get out in light of some things that were transpiring for his own safety and for hopefully in the future the safety of his family.
[time=630] He fled and God led him to the States and God led him to Fort Wayne and God led him to Blackhawk and while his wife Pamela and their six kids stayed behind now over two and a half years ago, David fled, was able to get to safety and found himself here.
[time=647] Well here we got to know him and here he began to be a part of this family and all the while he was trying his very best through all the red tape of paperwork and embassies to try and make it so that his family could come.
[time=659] And for two and a half years all of those efforts had been thwarted.
[time=664] Well God just chose I think in his sovereignty. It appeared as if God was choosing there in December to all of a sudden open up those doors.
[time=672] All of a sudden the red tape cleared up, all of a sudden the embassy was granting permission for Pamela and the six kids to come.
[time=679] David who had been working very hard to try his very best to put aside funds to bring them obviously realized that the plane ticket for seven was a little more than he could handle and so we decided to bring him to you, his family.
[time=694] And that day, first hour and second hour, as you listened to that story as David stood here with me with Dave Rondo who has become a good friend, Dave Rondo is part of our team here, that day you all put into my hands basically.
[time=711] On behalf of David, Dave Rondo and my, our hands, you came to us after the service, a plane ticket that was going to be plane tickets that were going to be about anywhere from $10,000 to $12,000 you all gave over $14,000.
[time=729] And that was a, that was a huge blessing to David, that was an enormous encouragement to his family. And, and here's how the conversation went. It was a great conversation.
[time=742] I was talking with this individual, they were talking to me about how sometimes it's challenging to give.
[time=748] And we were talking about, we were talking about this. And the individual was very honest and very forthright in telling me that so many times as this passes him by, so many times it's difficult for him because he said to me, when you had David on stage,
[time=766] and when you told David's story, I felt like as part of the body of Christ, there was something that was tangible and what? Real. And there was something I could give to. There was, I could make a difference, he says to me.
[time=782] And that man's life and in his family's life and for the kingdom and what God's going to do through them. And as he said that I completely, I completely understood. Absolutely.
[time=794] And what it led me to, what it led me to realize was that I think sometimes there is the assumption that this, and all that this represents, isn't as tangible or as real.
[time=808] And if we're talking about a plate, or we're talking about a guy with a wife and six kids, thousands of miles away, I understand that. And to be honest with you, and I'm just, I'm shooting straight here with you, I sometimes wish that we did more of that.
[time=827] Not necessarily less of this, but I long for a day and maybe we'll get there when we'll be able to function more where we bring those kinds of opportunities on more of a regular basis for you all to participate in. But it also got me thinking about this.
[time=842] It got me thinking about the real tangiableness of this. And maybe we've not done a good job. Maybe I've not done a very good job of communicating to you.
[time=853] The real tangiableness, the reality of all that goes on as this passes by each and every week.
[time=862] So, I just had the team put some things together this morning. I asked some folks to help me, and this is just an honest effort on my part to try and communicate, I think, the reality.
[time=872] And the opportunity God gives you and I every week to be a part of something that I think is extremely tangible and real.
[time=880] I've had them put a few things on the screen. We've got bills, and we've got missionaries, we've got staff families, we've got ministry to all ages.
[time=887] I want to just give you a couple of insights, just a couple of insights. That first column up there, the first thing up there are bills.
[time=893] I had them just put down a few of our regular, weekly or monthly obligations that we have because of God giving us the facility, the property, the opportunity that exists in the facility and property to do ministry.
[time=910] Heating an air, electricity, mortgage, and those are monthly numbers. And it's interesting. I had a conversation just recently, keep those numbers up there.
[time=920] I had a conversation recently with someone who said, "That's what I don't like about the church. They said to me, that's what I don't like."
[time=927] All that money, all that money going to buildings, all that money going to pay utilities, all that money that could be going other places because we've got this huge facility and this enormous property.
[time=939] And they said to me, "I wish it wasn't that way." And you know all I can say, and we had a great conversation, me and this individual, had a great conversation about how there's a part of me at times that understands that mentality.
[time=956] And sometimes wishes the same thing, but then I just had to look at them and say, "You know what? But we do.
[time=968] We have this. And I think we have this because God gave it. God moved in the hearts and you can say, "Well, it wasn't my heart.
[time=979] It was a bunch of hearts of people 30 years ago." It's true. And here we are.
[time=987] And for now, this is our reality. Utilities, mortgages, electricity, all of that, being used, doing our very best.
[time=999] And do we have to work at this? Yes. But doing our very best to do kingdom stuff inside and outside these four walls, and that's what it takes.
[time=1007] It is who we are, and we're going to keep doing our very best to faithfully steward all that God has provided.
[time=1014] Does that make sense? But it's not just brick and mortar. It's not just mortgage and utilities and electricity.
[time=1021] I had the team just pull three pictures of some priests, some priests of ours, priests that have been willing to go, missionaries, those who are doing their very best to pass along God to others.
[time=1038] You see Rod and Laurie Crable up here on the screen with their three gals. What a precious family.
[time=1045] Laurie's mom and dad, David Lucille Rondo, a part of our family. Rod and Laurie are in the Camora Islands.
[time=1052] Every time this goes by, every time you and I have an opportunity to give, we invest in the ministry that they have.
[time=1059] And now listen, they live in a situation politically and religiously today that is always, I mean I just talked to David about it this week, they are constantly on the verge.
[time=1071] Because of the religious and political situation they find themselves in in that situation, they are, they are front line, my friends.
[time=1081] That couple and those precious little ones giving themselves away and we get the privilege of supporting that ministry.
[time=1088] We get the privilege of supporting them. John Eppley, over on the far side there, John Eppley is giving his life to translating God's Word through Wycliffe Bible Translators.
[time=1100] John's giving his life to allow God's Word to be translated in places where there is no God's Word where people don't have the Scriptures.
[time=1109] And I can't even tell you today where John's doing that, I'm not allowed to. And I'm serious, John can't tell us where he is.
[time=1119] I mean I kind of know the continent, but that's about it.
[time=1124] Where John finds himself in the everyday of his life is this thin fine line between a joy in serving God and attention in just trying to keep himself going in situations where sometimes it's very difficult.
[time=1138] Every time this goes by, every time you and I have a chance to bring our ties and offerings in a real and tangible way.
[time=1147] People's lives are affected here and all over the world.
[time=1151] You may recognize that good looking gal in the middle, that's my mom.
[time=1156] And boy talk about front lines, as many of you know, and I'm so grateful, many of you pray for my mom, many of you pray for all of our missionaries.
[time=1164] We have I think 38 of them, maybe low 40s, but my mom is one that we support periodically.
[time=1170] She teaches English in Kabul, Afghanistan.
[time=1176] And I'll tell you, that's about as front line as it gets these days.
[time=1182] We get to email maybe twice a month from what we hear from her.
[time=1187] It is increasingly tense in Afghanistan and she continues to just kind of do her thing and give herself completely to what God has her doing there in Kabul.
[time=1200] As she teaches English and communicates God's truth and builds redemptive relationships with people, all ages and ethnicities.
[time=1209] Every time this goes by, you and I get a chance to tangibly meet a need.
[time=1214] It's not just a plate.
[time=1216] And though mortgages and utilities and electricity may not seem as invigorating, it allows us to do so much of what God has us doing here.
[time=1224] And it allows us to do a great deal in other places.
[time=1230] It also, every time this goes by, as thankful as I am for my mother in Kabul, Afghanistan.
[time=1236] And I understand that sometimes when we see pictures like that and we hear stories like that, we think, wow, now that's ministry.
[time=1245] Now, there's a missionary.
[time=1246] Well, I want to remind you that there are real people in the everyday of life here in this setting that give themselves completely and sacrificially to serving and investing in you.
[time=1258] Where's Corbin? Tonya, come on up here, Corbin, if you're on your own, there you go. Oh, there's Tonya in the back.
[time=1265] Corbin and Tonya, just a representation.
[time=1268] And I'm going to have my other gals come up too, Kelly and Emma. Are you here? Caitlin here? Oh, there she is.
[time=1275] This is Kelly Gualdoni. Caitlin Kaufman. Hi, sweetie.
[time=1281] How are you? Good. Emma, go watch. Hi. Good to have you all here.
[time=1286] Hi, Millers. Nice to see you. Hello there. Nice to see you.
[time=1294] Every time, and I'm not doing this, I'm just doing this to be forthright with you all.
[time=1300] Every time that this goes by, you help put food on a table.
[time=1308] Every time this goes by, there's an entire team of people here who are giving their lives every day.
[time=1315] And the clothes on their back and the food on their table and their opportunity to live is based upon the kindness and the generosity of God's people.
[time=1324] That's about as real and tangible as it gets.
[time=1329] Every time this comes by, I'm thankful for these gals. Now, Caitlin, you're in preschool, right?
[time=1336] Pre-K. She's in pre-K, and are you five or six or four? How old are you?
[time=1341] You're five years old, and do you like being in pre-K?
[time=1346] Yeah, I thought so. Kelly, you're a senior at Snyder, Snyder High School here in town.
[time=1351] Emma, seventh grader at Blackhawk Christian, and every time this goes by,
[time=1357] whether it's through our school or whether it's through student ministries, whether it's through what goes on in the everyday with over 700 kids and their families here, or whether it's a Wednesday night at 212, you may recognize Kelly.
[time=1371] She was the lead gal in the drama just a little bit. Was that last week?
[time=1376] Two weeks ago, she was the gal who played the young lady trying to figure out how in the world she was going to survive in today's culture.
[time=1384] Whether it's 212 on a Wednesday night, liquid on a Sunday morning, here we have over 100 kids in liquid now.
[time=1391] Over the last few weeks on Wednesday nights in 212, they've been running over 200, 210 kids from probably six, seven, eight different high school campuses in our community.
[time=1403] That's about as tangible and real as it gets.
[time=1408] And from young people who we get to invest in to families who serve you faithfully,
[time=1414] so electric bills and missionaries, and David Mapenda.
[time=1421] David, where are you? Come on up here, my friend.
[time=1424] I want David to come up here and join us. I want you to see kind of this whole picture if we can.
[time=1430] David, just to give you an update, we're still waiting.
[time=1434] David's still waiting to hear from. There's been some recent red tape kind of introduced back into the high, my friend.
[time=1442] Good to see you. Come on down here and stand next to Tanya, if you will.
[time=1445] Everybody welcome, David. Say hi, David.
[time=1447] There's been some red tape kind of thrown back into the process, and he's doing his very best to endure,
[time=1456] and we're doing our very best to help, and David Lucille and others are coming alongside.
[time=1461] But we're hoping that in the days to come, that Pamela and the children will be here, your gifts and your real and tangible gifts have made a huge difference in his life,
[time=1474] and they make a difference in the lives of countless others.
[time=1477] And it is all something that we are so grateful to be a part of.
[time=1481] I want to ask if you would, I hope all that made sense.
[time=1484] That makes sense, nod your head or say something.
[time=1486] Okay, good. Here's what I want you to do. Would you all just bow your heads, and would you just pray?
[time=1491] We're going to just pray for Pamela and the kids. Can we do that?
[time=1494] And if you would with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, would you just reach out a hand toward David?
[time=1499] Please do that. Everybody, would you just reach out a hand toward David, toward the stage, and let's just pray together.
[time=1505] God, we thank you for, for David and Pamela and the kids.
[time=1508] We thank you for these people who stand on this stage this morning.
[time=1512] God, we're thankful for the real and tangible ways that we get to give, and we just ask God that you would supersede.
[time=1519] We ask God that you would allow in the days to come for corrupt politicians in that country to go away,
[time=1527] that you would allow visas to be granted. God, that you would allow the tickets to finally be handed over.
[time=1533] God, that this family could be reunited. That would be our desire.
[time=1537] God, thank you for Tanya and Corbin. Thank you for these gals that stand here.
[time=1540] Thank you for all that they represent, people who are giving themselves to ministry and God, the privilege it is for us to be a part of it.
[time=1548] May we give, and may we support with whole hearts in your son's name. We pray. Amen.
[time=1555] Hey, would you thank all these folks for being up here this morning?
[time=1558] Thanks you guys. Appreciate it.
[time=1565] All right.
[time=1567] Hey, if you would, open your Bibles. We got some time he left here this morning, and I want to bring us back, if I can, to our study in 1 John.
[time=1575] So open your Bibles this morning to 1 John chapter 2, and we come this morning to yet another test,
[time=1583] another examination, if you will, another opportunity for you and I to assess the genuineness of our faith.
[time=1592] Just a quick reminder for you. That's where we've been in recent months.
[time=1596] We've been making our way slowly, but surely through this book of 1 John, which is written by John, who had had an integral part in the establishing of the church in the Ephesus region.
[time=1607] John had from the beginning invested his heart and his time into the lives of these people.
[time=1612] It was a strong church. It grew quickly. God did great things.
[time=1617] And now John later in life as an elderly man now is concerned as he sees that very church in that very region beginning to be corrupted by false teaching.
[time=1630] His church is now being overrun by a philosophy of the day called Gnosticism, which is literally eroding the foundation of its effect, the foundation of its ministry, the foundation of its people.
[time=1645] And so God is concerned, and John is concerned, and so John writes in a sense to say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We've got to come back to the basics here.
[time=1655] Many of you are raising your hands and professing to be believers. Many of you professing to know the Lord, and yet what you've learned, what you've been sold as a bill of goods, not accurate with the original truth that this church and your spiritual lives were founded upon."
[time=1674] And so what he does is he just begins to kind of address issue after issue, after issue, giving people the opportunity to become reacquainted with God's design, not the false teachers teaching.
[time=1687] And so we've in essence seen a series of tests. There was the test of a proper view of Christ.
[time=1695] So very important that he speak, because that specific heresy, Gnosticism was chipping away at the person in the work of Christ, and so right out of the gate in chapter 1, we see the test of a proper view of Christ.
[time=1709] A genuine, fully surrendered follower of Christ will have a proper view of Christ. It's foundational. It's got to be there.
[time=1719] We saw a second test, and that was the test of obedience. We saw in chapter 1 on into chapter 2 that the fully surrendered, the genuinely saved, will live a life that is marked by a desire to and a willingness to go and obey.
[time=1736] We're not talking about perfection. We're not saying the genuine believer will have no disobedience in their life. We're saying their heart, the pattern of their heart will be marked by a desire to and a willingness to obey.
[time=1749] And that times of disobedience allotted for in 1 John 1 9, where he says if we confess our sin, he knew we would sin, disobedience in the life of the believer isn't the pattern. It's not the desire.
[time=1762] It's not the overarching, consistent day-to-day reality. No. He says the test of obedience gives indication to those who truly know him. They are an obedient people.
[time=1776] We saw the test of love. We've spent several weeks talking about the test of love. John speaks to it throughout the book. We've seen it in these first two chapters where John has basically come at it two ways.
[time=1788] Number one, he talked about what we were to love. He talked about how genuine believers will love God and how genuine believers will, out of that deep love for God, love others.
[time=1798] Then last week, actually the last two weeks, we saw that there was in the test of love for the genuine believer there was something that we weren't to love.
[time=1807] We weren't to love. We were to love God and others. We are not to love because genuine believers don't. The world.
[time=1816] And if you missed any of that, I would encourage you to download it or go to the website or pick up a CD, whatever you do to listen to stuff. Those were two weeks, I think, worth you taking some time to give some thought.
[time=1827] And now we come, my friends, this morning to a new test.
[time=1832] Another in the series of tests that allow you and I to assess the reality of our faith. And this this morning, my friends, is the test of an enduring faith.
[time=1843] This is this morning, the test of an enduring faith. Real, genuine believers, their faith perseveres, their faith, it endures.
[time=1861] And what a great passage to help us understand this better. Would you stand in honor of God's Word? Let me read this to you. It's lengthy, but you'll see as we make our way through.
[time=1871] It speaks to these very things. 1 John 2 verses 18 to 27. Children, I love how he starts it again. I love how in such a confront of book, I love in such a bold and at times in your Facebook, I love the love of John and the compassion and the tenderness with which he speaks to his people.
[time=1895] And he says, it is the last hour. Last hour, meaning, just so you know, wherever you see the last hour, oftentimes referred to as the last days, this would be the period of time between Christ's first coming and Christ's second coming.
[time=1911] So we live in the last days. We live in the last hours. The church has lived in that time span since he went to be with the Lord.
[time=1920] These are the last days. And just as you heard verse 18, that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared.
[time=1931] From this we know that it is the last hour. They went out verse 19. They went out from us. He now begins to address a certain segment of people, that the folks in the church there in the Ephesus region had obviously experienced.
[time=1946] They went out from us, but they were not really of us. For if they had been, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us, but they went out so that it would be shown that they all are not of us.
[time=1963] But you, he says you have an anointing from the Holy One. In essence, he's saying you haven't gone anywhere, where you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it.
[time=1981] And because no lie is of the truth. Who is the liar, but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the father and the son.
[time=1994] Whoever denies the son does not have the father, the one who confesses the son has the father also, as for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning.
[time=2006] What they had heard from the beginning was the truth. What they had heard from the beginning was the gospel. What they heard from the beginning was salvation by faith through grace.
[time=2016] What they had heard was Christ alone. As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning, the truth about Jesus, if that abides in you, remains in you, is steadfast in you,
[time=2034] you also will abide in the son and in the father. This is the promise which he himself made to us. Everybody say this together, eternal life.
[time=2045] That's where all that leads. These things I have written verse 26 to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you.
[time=2053] As for you, the anointing which you received from him abides in you and you have no need for anyone to teach you, but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie, and just as it taught you, you abide in him.
[time=2076] Father, God, we thank you this morning for both the warning and the encouragement that we find in this passage. God, as we discover it this morning, as we give it thought, and even as we take it with us today, we pray that you would use this truth, God, to grow us and change us, to bring stability and comfort, God, to bring direction.
[time=2098] God, we want to be a people that obey. We want to be a people that follow after you, God. We want to be people that bring great glory and honor to you.
[time=2107] May this truth today lead us in that direction, in your son's name we pray. Amen. You can be seated.
[time=2116] Well, right out of the gate, obviously in verse 18, John brings to the discussion this morning an individual, a real individual the Bible speaks of, and the Bible gives prophecy regarding this anti-Christ.
[time=2130] For the purpose of our discussion today, I want you just to realize there is a capital A anti-Christ, and there is a small A anti-Christ that John refers to here.
[time=2141] We oftentimes are enamored by and given to much discussion about this capital A anti-Christ.
[time=2148] This morning, as we dive in here, this is not going to be about the capital A anti-Christ. That is a, that is a, that's a broad subject.
[time=2157] There is a lot to that discussion, but I do want to just share with you this morning just a basic, if I can, just a basic overview of that individual.
[time=2166] We do see in the scriptures God addressing the issue that there will be a, there will be a man someday used by Satan in the end times to move people away from that which is true.
[time=2179] I had him write this down for you, the anti-Christ, and this, this is as I understand it. Let me say that.
[time=2185] This is as I, so this point in time, as I've studied and listened, this is what I understand to be true, that the anti-Christ will be a subtle, very important that you underline that word, a subtle, extremely deceptive world leader who in the last days,
[time=2203] prior to Christ's final return and judgment will with great power and with great persuasion lead the nations in one final apostasy.
[time=2214] He will lead the nations in one final rebellion against God.
[time=2220] Some would say that this will take place, that this will begin to take place in the seven year tribulation period, that this will be an individual, again incredibly subtle and incredibly deceptive, who will appear to be one who is for what is right and good.
[time=2237] And in the first three and a half years of that tribulation will evidence that then in the last three and a half years will flip flop and begin to with his deceptive power and persuasion move people away from that.
[time=2249] Which is true and right and good.
[time=2252] It's an amazing study, we can come back to it sometime, there's a lot to it.
[time=2257] But John's main purpose here in this passage, my friends, is to get you and I thinking about the small A, anti-Christ's, and our response to them.
[time=2268] While John briefly mentions this individual, this capital A, anti-Christ, here in verse 18, he quickly moves to the alarming reality that there are small A, anti-Christ's, who distort the truth and practice spiritual deception in their efforts here, in their efforts in the local church,
[time=2289] in their efforts in the Ecclesia, their efforts there in the church in the Ephesian region there, where John had built so much and given so much of his time and effort to, he saw that there were little A, anti-Christ's, who were distorting the truth and moving people in dangerous directions.
[time=2309] And so he speaks to that here, he warns us and then I want you to see some encouragement as well, write this down, the three traits, he gives you the three traits of a false teacher, the three characteristics of a deceiver.
[time=2322] These would be three, as John experienced it, and as John writes about it for us here, these are the three marks of those who attempt to move people deceptively away from the truth.
[time=2334] Number one, they leave the family, write that down, they leave the family, and this takes us back to 19, in our passage, verse 19, remember they were among us, but then they went out from us.
[time=2349] And he says, but they wouldn't have gone out from us if they were truly one of us, because if they're truly one of us, they wouldn't go out from us.
[time=2357] And there are those who you and I think, there are those, and I've seen it, in 22 years of ministry, you've probably experienced this to some degree in your life and your experience in your journey with God and your relationship with the church.
[time=2372] There are those who, from what you can tell, you would have sworn that they were in, but then they're not.
[time=2382] There are those that leave, and I want to be clear here, I'm not talking about leaving 7,400 East State Boulevard.
[time=2390] I'm not talking about people with bad attitudes who don't like the carpet.
[time=2395] I'm not talking about folks who don't like certain songs or don't like certain preachers.
[time=2401] We're not talking about petty stuff like that.
[time=2405] We're talking about really serious leaving, we're talking about leaving the faith.
[time=2411] There are those who leave the family, the fully surrendered family of God, there are those who leave the faith.
[time=2423] This is an opportunity, we can't get into all of this this morning, but as John begins to lay this out for us, what we see developing here really, it's a foundational doctrine of the faith.
[time=2438] It's something that, you know, they taught us in theology class and it's something that you and I need to understand and be able to articulate and I think internalize.
[time=2447] And this doctrine that I think is introduced here is what they call the perseverance of the saints.
[time=2453] There is a doctrine that we hold to, there is a doctrine that I hold to that speaks to the enduring quality of a genuine believer.
[time=2463] It is, I believe in the scripture, the clear realization that someone who has truly and genuinely come to faith in Christ,
[time=2471] someone who has truly and genuinely bow the knee of their heart, someone who has truly and genuinely and deeply embraced Christ as their hope for salvation and forgiveness.
[time=2483] That person's faith, no matter what they see, no matter what they encounter, no matter what pressing or no matter what challenge or no matter what trial,
[time=2492] or no matter what tribulation God allows, that faith, if it's true and genuine, endures the perseverance of the saints.
[time=2504] And this is what we see beginning to develop here in this discussion.
[time=2508] The first trait of the false teacher is they leave the family, you may have seen this, you may have known someone, you may have had a conversation.
[time=2518] And I want to say this, there are some who, and I want to say this lovingly, there are some, and maybe you've seen this as well,
[time=2526] there are some who sit down with you and tell you they're out.
[time=2530] And I can't tell you how many times I've been in situations where I've ended up having to sit with someone who had made choices, painful, destructive, discouraging, dark choices.
[time=2546] And now all of that's kind of come into the light and I can't tell you, there have been times where I've sat with those people.
[time=2552] And what they've done in the midst of that right there, that reality is they've said, you know what, I'm out of here.
[time=2559] And I don't believe any of this anyway.
[time=2563] Maybe you've seen that, maybe you've heard that.
[time=2567] You see sometimes what happens is with people is instead of really facing with humility all that has transpired and dealing with what they know down deep inside really is true, sometimes pride.
[time=2580] Sometimes it's easier to just be prideful and say, well, one way I can kind of get out of this is just to say I don't believe that.
[time=2589] And if I say I don't believe that, then I'm free from that and I just get to do whatever I want to do.
[time=2595] Have you ever encountered that? You ever heard that? You ever watched that?
[time=2600] I don't think that is this really. I know it looks like it.
[time=2604] But I can't tell you how many times I've watched people who I, you know, as much as I know or as much as I can sense, I know down deep inside they know that that's true.
[time=2614] It's just easier to say it's not. But there are those.
[time=2618] There are those who I've really thought were in and it wasn't because something got exposed.
[time=2624] It wasn't because I have just seen those who I thought were in come to the place where they've just said, you know what I'm out.
[time=2630] I don't believe this.
[time=2634] This isn't true and I'm gone.
[time=2638] And they deny the faith. It's the second trait of a false teacher or deceiver.
[time=2643] It's the second characteristic of a little a antichrist. They deny the faith.
[time=2648] They leave the family in leaving the family. They really do deny the faith.
[time=2652] Look what it says in verses 22 and 23 of our text this morning.
[time=2657] John says, who is the liar? But the one who denies that, and I want you to see this, the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=2666] The one who denies that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=2672] This, my friends, is the ultimate denial of the faith.
[time=2677] I want to make sure we understand this. I want to make sure that you understand that there are many things.
[time=2682] There are many things in here. There are many things in the everyday practice of you and I living out our faith.
[time=2690] There are a number of things that we don't have to see the same way, right?
[time=2696] The pastor asks, "Right," the church says, "Awesome." I mean, that's just a long list of stuff in here where I feel like God gives us great freedom for you to say, "I think this."
[time=2709] And for me to say, "Well, I think this." And for us to go have a meal.
[time=2715] There are some things where we don't have that freedom.
[time=2721] There are some non-negotiables, hills that we, what, die on.
[time=2729] And Jesus, remember the first test, chapter one, proper view of who? Christ.
[time=2735] Jesus being the Son of God, Jesus being the propitiation, the sacrifice for our sins, the role, the person, the attributes of Christ,
[time=2745] this picture of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, absolutely foundational.
[time=2754] And there are those who leave the family and in leaving deny the faith.
[time=2760] Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the anti-Christ, the one who denies the Father and the Son.
[time=2769] Verse 23, "Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father, the one who confesses the Son has the Father."
[time=2776] Go real quick to 1 John 4.
[time=2779] Go over just a couple of pages to 1 John 4. I want you to see this, verses 1 to 3.
[time=2784] Beloved, there's that fatherly tone again. Watch this. Beloved, do not believe every spirit.
[time=2791] Do you see that? Do you all see that? You know what that means, right?
[time=2795] Do not believe everything you what? Do not believe everything you watch. Don't believe every infomercial.
[time=2803] Don't believe every book you read. Don't believe everything you hear on the radio.
[time=2808] Don't believe every conversation you have in a hallway. It's okay for you and I to listen in dialogue.
[time=2814] It's okay for us to be in the conversation. Listen, everything you and I hear that has anything to do with life
[time=2823] and that which God has called us to. He says, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit." But test the spirits to see whether they are from God.
[time=2832] Because many false prophets, many communicators, many leaders, many church people have gone out into the world.
[time=2841] By this you know the spirit of God. Every spirit, here you go. Let's bring it back to that which is foundational.
[time=2848] John brings it back to that which is non-negotiable.
[time=2852] By this you know the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
[time=2861] And every spirit that does not, every message that does not, every individual that does not confess Jesus is not from God.
[time=2872] This is the spirit of the Antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming and now it is already in the world.
[time=2880] Capital A, the spirit of the capital A Antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming.
[time=2887] And now it is little A Antichrists, it is already in the world.
[time=2895] The centrality, my friends, of the person and work of Christ. Look at, go over one more page to chapter 5.
[time=2903] And here we come to back in chapter 2 in our text for the day.
[time=2907] If you'll remember, we just read about how if you deny the Son, you deny the Father.
[time=2911] If you deny the Father, you deny the Son. See those are inextricably linked. Look at 5, 9 and 10.
[time=2917] 1 John 5, 9. If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater.
[time=2923] For the testimony of God is this, that he has testified, that he has clarified, that he has spoken, that's what that means, concerning his Son.
[time=2933] The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself.
[time=2938] The one who does not believe, the testimony of God about Christ, the one who does not believe, God has made him a liar
[time=2946] because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.
[time=2952] They deny the faith, they leave the family, they deny the faith, now watch this.
[time=2957] They attempt to come back, they do. They always do. There is always something in this individual.
[time=2963] There is always something about these individuals where they, and I think it's because of who they're empowered by.
[time=2968] They are empowered by the enemy, and the enemy wants nothing more than to destroy us.
[time=2974] He wants to destroy the church. He wants to destroy the bride of Christ. He knows.
[time=2981] He knows that the bride of Christ, the church, is the tool by which God has ordained that those outside the family of God would be reached, loved, and redeemed.
[time=2991] And he wants the church and its efforts ruined, and so they come back.
[time=2997] We thought they were of us. They leave. They deny the faith, and then they come back,
[time=3004] and they try to take you and die with them. They attempt to come back and deceive.
[time=3012] Like a verse 26, back to chapter 2.
[time=3019] It says in 1 John 2, 26, "These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you."
[time=3027] You know, it's one of the things that I do, my friends. It's one of the things that we do as leaders.
[time=3033] And it's one of the things that you rarely ever see. So much of what I do, you see.
[time=3038] So much of what our leadership does, you oftentimes see the effect of.
[time=3043] There are times, many times, where I have found myself in situations with those who I've perceived or we've determined
[time=3053] have a message and an agenda that is contrary to this, and they are here.
[time=3062] And they're among us at times, and they're trying to tempt you. They're trying to invite you.
[time=3068] They're trying to encourage you. They're trying to get you to actually begin to think along the lines.
[time=3073] There have been so many times where we've had situations, where we've had to meet with those individuals, where we've had to try our best to do what Paul said in Acts 20. Write that down. Write down Acts 20, 28 to 30.
[time=3086] Go back today and read the whole chapter.
[time=3090] You'll just be amazed at the passion with which Paul encourages elders at the church at Ephesus
[time=3098] to be careful and to take care of their flock. Look what it says in 28.
[time=3103] "Be on guard," he says, "for yourselves, first of all, and for all the flock." This is Paul talking to those who were leading the church in that day.
[time=3113] "And for all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God,
[time=3121] which he purchased with his own blood." It goes on in 29 to say this.
[time=3125] It says, "I know that after my departure, Paul's talking with them at the beach there in my leaders.
[time=3131] He's getting ready to hop in a boat and shove off, and he's leaving these guys to care for this local body."
[time=3137] And he says, "I know that after my departure, savage wolves, antichrists, small A,
[time=3144] deceivers and deceptive individuals who subtly look like they're leading in a good direction
[time=3151] but really are taking folks down a very, very dangerous path." He says, "I know after my departure,
[time=3157] savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock." And in verse 30 he concludes, "And from among your own selves," what must that have been like?
[time=3169] He's got the elders right there, and now he's not just talking about the family.
[time=3174] He's looking at the elders saying, "And from among you, from among your own selves, men will arise,"
[time=3183] speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.
[time=3193] It is one of the most overwhelming, intimidating, scary responsibilities that I live with every day of my life.
[time=3206] As I feel and we feel here as leaders a deep sense of responsibility to guard you and to shepherd you
[time=3214] and to keep you from that which is not true.
[time=3218] Now how do we do that? How do I love this? I'm going to end with this.
[time=3222] I want to just show you two things. What enables a true Christ follower to not be deceived?
[time=3227] What is the message that we as leaders want to communicate?
[time=3230] What is the reality that you as Christ followers need to experience in your own life?
[time=3236] The Holy Spirit's protection, number one in the Holy Spirit, write that down.
[time=3240] The Holy Spirit's protection keeps you from that deception, and the Holy Spirit's education keeps you from that deception.
[time=3248] Come with me back to the beginning almost of our passage, verse 20.
[time=3253] He talked about those who left, but look at verse 20, but you remember this, but you have an anointing.
[time=3259] You haven't been deceived. You haven't left. You are of us.
[time=3264] Because you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know, there's that word gnosis.
[time=3272] The Gnostics had twisted it. Now he comes back and uses that very word to capture the very essence of what it is that keeps them grounded.
[time=3282] He says, "You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know the truth, and because no lie is of the truth."
[time=3293] Write this down. The Holy Spirit protects. The Holy Spirit protects. He convicts, here's how He protects.
[time=3300] He convicts all believers of their sin. He is the transforming agent in the sanctification process.
[time=3307] You wonder how it is. You're doing things differently. You wonder how it is. You're thinking things differently.
[time=3311] You wonder how it is that you're making choices you didn't used to make.
[time=3314] You wonder what's going on inside of you that's growing you toward this. It's the Holy Spirit.
[time=3320] The Holy Spirit grows you. The Holy Spirit convicts and transforms you. He indwells you. He instructs you.
[time=3328] He empowers you and watch this. He protects the children of God.
[time=3333] Ephesians 2 says, "We're sealed." Back to the perseverance of the saints. Back to this enduring faith.
[time=3341] When you know Him genuinely, Ephesians 2 says, "You are sealed in the Spirit." Can't be broken. Can't be opened up. Can't be messed with.
[time=3349] Sealed. Boom. His. Forever. Romans 8. Nothing can separate you from the what? From the love of God.
[time=3357] And He's an educator. The Holy Spirit protects and the Holy Spirit educates. Remember what John said here?
[time=3363] I'm writing to you because you know the Holy Spirit expands your understanding, your knowledge of that which is true.
[time=3370] And when you know down deep inside what is true that allows you and I to do what is true, to be what God has called us.
[time=3378] To be. More to say there. Not enough time. Would you stand? Let me pray for us this morning.
[time=3384] And as you stand quietly, with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, let me just, let me just remind you.
[time=3393] As you stand there quietly this morning, let me just remind you of how thankful you and I should be.
[time=3399] How deeply grateful we should be for the Holy Spirit and the protection and the nudges and the leadings and the safety and the teaching and the equipping, the Holy Spirit of God.
[time=3417] And yes, God uses teachers. Yes, God uses individuals. But that is merely a mecca. We are merely tools of God through which the Spirit works and you and I should be so very thankful.
[time=3430] If you know Him today, if you are secure, not perfect, but so thankful and so secure in that relationship with Him, if you know Him, be so very thankful that He protects you from the Deceptor.
[time=3442] Oh God, we stand grateful for the protecting and educating that your Spirit does in us daily.
[time=3450] May we, God, be a people who posture ourselves each and every day because of our love for you.
[time=3457] May we be a people who posture ourselves in such a way whereby God, we cooperate with your protection and we open ourselves, God, to your Spirit's education so that we can be a people who know and in our knowing God.
[time=3471] And in our knowing God allow us to do that, which you've called us to do. We love you.
[time=3476] We thank you for the privilege of worship this morning and all the people agreed and said, "Amen, God bless you."
