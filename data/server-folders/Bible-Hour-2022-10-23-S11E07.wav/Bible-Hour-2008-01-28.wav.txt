[time=50] [MUSIC]
[time=60] You know, singing, just a moment ago, "Ferris, Lord Jesus." It reminds me of being a little kid.
[time=68] I've told many of you, the stories have grown up.
[time=71] My dad was a pastor.
[time=74] It was my dad, my mom, and I. It's just the three of us, and I spent many a Sunday morning.
[time=79] And many a Sunday night, and many a Wednesday night, under a pew,
[time=86] on my back, crawling around, trying to behave.
[time=89] But those were good days and great memories.
[time=92] And when I hear an old song, and when we sing songs that kind of take us back, my heart's filled with gratitude for a lot of what God taught me, and a lot of what God showed me, like I'm sure many of you do.
[time=105] There's connections that we make to songs that we sang years ago.
[time=109] Growing up, as I got older, I got introduced to all kinds of music.
[time=115] My dad was a big Southern Gospel fan, and if it wasn't the Gathers, it was somebody else,
[time=121] and we listened to the albums there in the living room, and from hymns to albums of the Gathers to high school college days, then coming to places where it introduced me to praise and worship songs, that meant a great deal to me, that continued to grow me, and teach me, and give me a vision and a view of my God that I'll forever be grateful for.
[time=142] So I remember in high school, Christian rock, and I remember older people
[time=149] just absolutely coming on glued over Christian rock, and how loud it was, and how it was this or that. But I remember seeing friends of mine come to faith in Christ
[time=160] through, was it, Striper? Striper. There's a blast from the past.
[time=166] I know we all have our preferences. I understand that. We all have that kind of music that we like.
[time=175] That's a good thing. God, I think, designed us that way. But Paul and other New Testament writers are so very clear that preferences included, we are to always exercise a willingness to come
[time=188] together and be one, one body, one faith, one spirit. And I know today as I listen to my kid's
[time=199] music, it's kind of funny to say that, but now I'm saying it. I'm listening to my kid's music.
[time=205] Now all of a sudden there's new genres to take in and new styles to become familiar with. And
[time=212] recently I've come across a new, for me it's been new in the last probably couple years. It's a style
[time=218] called the spoken word. And I think it's kind of a somewhat of a derivative of rap. But what it is
[time=224] really is I think soulful poetry. And there's a young lady who I just want you to listen to here
[time=231] this morning. I'm not showing this to you this morning as like show and tell. This isn't for you to assess. This is to minister to you. This is to bless you. And this is to just allow you and
[time=243] I to continue to be so very thankful for the different forms of worship, the different styles in which
[time=250] people today are doing their very best to make much of God. So be encouraged and be so very thankful
[time=257] for our one and only God. You find me when I'm hiding behind all my disguises you see me.
[time=269] It takes you to keep me breathing. You are heart, passion, vision. You send me and bring me close,
[time=279] close so close until when you look at me you see you. You are heavenly. My present and future
[time=288] destiny. You are father, creator, sustainer, life changer, pride breaker. You are the same
[time=296] yesterday, now and forever. You are pleasure, worth, reason, present in every season. You are worship
[time=305] devotion. You are the reason for all my commotion. You are the one that I pray to. You can tell that
[time=312] I'm nothing without you. So awesome that I can even pray to you about you to know you, to sense you,
[time=320] to believe you more, to love you more, to obey you more, to give you more of my heart. God search me,
[time=327] know me, see me, examine me, test me, watch me, investigate me, question me, be pleased with me,
[time=339] be my reality, sustain me, decrease me, decrease me, decrease me. So there's no me left, only you.
[time=351] Only you, only you are light, are true, are you, are hope, are joy, are strength, are escape,
[time=362] rescue safe, you are peace, you are belief, you are advance and retreat of what? To what? To whom can I
[time=372] compare you? You are my all things new, you are my place of refuge, my fortress, my rest, my creativity,
[time=380] and the strength of your words to me. You are my ability to see, hear, feel, move, live, breathe, be.
[time=389] You are life and death all at the same time. You are friend, believer, savior, redeemer. You are the
[time=399] truth. You transcend old age and youth. You are timeless, priceless, lightness and darkness,
[time=408] greatness, goodness, sinless, and in a mess like my life, you see righteousness.
[time=416] You leave me speechless, you alone are God.
[time=438] God, you are holy, Lord, you are holy and we lift you up, and make us want your way.
[time=479] If I look around and I see all the works your hands have made, the awesomeness of you
[time=494] and how your love will never fade. If you ask me God express how I feel inside
[time=503] and I'm humbled by your glory divide, but as a token of my love, this is what I'll do.
[time=514] I'll lift my hands and cry, Lord, you are holy and we lift you up, and make us want your way.
[time=539] Holy is the name of God, and God holy and we lift you up, and make us want your way.
[time=551] There are not enough words that I can't say, to tell you how much I appreciate all the wonderful
[time=563] things you've given me. Your love and kindness, your tenderness sees, I've got to pray, I love you.
[time=579] Oh, the worthy of all the glory, and your worthy of all the glory, but I don't know why you love me.
[time=594] I don't know why you'd show me the mercy, I don't know why it suffered. Way back, way back on
[time=605] Calvary. You lost without you Jesus, I'm thanking you Jesus, you're worthy of all of the praise.
[time=624] You are wonderful, glorious, holy and righteous, victorious, conquer a child that's in mind,
[time=633] he will deliver her, she'll have the best, scottower and light as a fan.
[time=643] For me protect, omnipresent, soon from me king, Alpha Omega, whatever it is, holy, holy, holy,
[time=655] it is no way. Wonderful, glorious, holy and righteous, victorious, conquer a child that's in mind,
[time=669] he will deliver, she'll have the best, strong, sour and light as a fan. For me it is no way.
[time=684] Oh, the worthy of all the glory, holy, holy, holy, holy, I've got his glory.
[time=703] Majesty and foe, holy, holy, it is no way.
[time=717] Gingerbread, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=747] Hi everybody, welcome to the broadcast again, we're thankful that you've tuned in and I mean that, we are very grateful, we know that many of you tune in each and every week and the Bible hour and what you're able to experience here, God uses it to encourage you in your walk and in
[time=763] your relationship with him. Others of you we know tune in and you don't know him yet, you haven't
[time=770] come to that point where you have fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, but you're asking questions you never used to care about, you're looking for answers that used to in your past
[time=781] never be of interest to you and our hope is that we can help, our belief is that the Word of God
[time=787] and the Spirit of God has a way of drawing you toward Christ, we believe that the answers that
[time=794] you search for in your life are found in the person and in the Word of God and we can't wait to further
[time=801] our efforts to help you understand and see that better, we're thankful for the chance to do all
[time=807] the above. Hey I want to let you know also about what's coming up in April, it's a little ways out
[time=813] but I know many of you are interested in this and many of you care deeply about what God is allowing us to experience here at Black Hawk, we get to go back to Nairobi Kenya, that's right about a year ago or so, me and a few guys from our team went to Nairobi to establish and further
[time=830] a relationship with a phenomenal organization called New Life Home Trust. The New Life family
[time=836] there in Nairobi has a central orphanage there in Nairobi Kenya and then five satellite orphanages,
[time=844] they have an amazing task and they find themselves daily in the midst of an incredible journey as
[time=850] they seek to rescue and then raise AIDS babies. About 300 babies a day, 300 are abandoned in the
[time=860] Nairobi Kenya area. Poverty and disease leave young mothers basically hopeless and so babies
[time=869] are literally in their newborn state tossed into garbage heaps, put into sewer canals, left out in
[time=876] the bush for the wild animals to devour, it is a tragic scene and these folks are doing an amazing
[time=884] job of helping bring life and comfort to little ones. Our hope is to simply come alongside in that
[time=890] effort and do all that we can with the babies themselves from a nurture and medical perspective,
[time=896] also to assist the team at New Life Home Trust in the physical plant development, those orphanages
[time=904] need help, their staff needs encouragement and so we're going to be taking about I think 16,
[time=910] 17 folks with me in April and we're going to see another team going in June. We want to be
[time=917] priests that go and while we are deeply vested in ministry here in Fort Wayne, while we continue
[time=924] to go to Biloxi to help folks rebuild their lives in that region, we want to go as it says in the
[time=930] book of Acts to the ends of the earth as well. Locally, regionally, nationally and globally,
[time=937] our effort is to be a family of priests that are willing to be mobile, to not sit still but to go
[time=944] and to in our going if you'll remember from our I'm a priest series, in our going we want to pass
[time=950] along God to others and so I just I hope that you'll pray for us, I hope that you'll be aware
[time=956] of what God's doing, I hope that you'll be one if you know him who goes, I hope you don't sit still,
[time=962] I hope you don't just take in all that he's given you and all that he's provided you and not do
[time=968] something with in your neighborhood here in Fort Wayne in this region across this country or even
[time=975] across the world, if we can help you in any way get mobile, if we can encourage you to be one who
[time=982] goes, don't hesitate to let us know, we'd love to hear from you, we're so thankful for all of the
[time=989] opportunities that God's given us, we hope that you'll pray for us as we continue to be a people that go and if you're ever interested in going with us we'd love to come alongside and help you,
[time=1001] call us, shoot us an email and know how thankful we are for you, hey have a great week, we're thankful
[time=1007] that you tuned in, God bless you and as always we hope to see you soon. I love that little segue
[time=1014] that happens a lot of times when the piano is playing and we're waiting to get into the word and
[time=1020] you can quiet your heart there and and be together in that when we come together here in our gathering
[time=1029] we get to we get to do that together and there's something powerful about that and
[time=1036] I just I want to encourage you, I want to I want you to just
[time=1042] think about this this morning, this passage of scripture is one that can be
[time=1049] like Kelly said a couple weeks ago, John doesn't do this, it can be preached like that
[time=1058] but he doesn't wag his finger in our face in this book, God isn't doing that here, God's presenting us with a clear revelation about an incredible opportunity that we have
[time=1071] and I'd just like for you to to consider as we move through this passage of scripture that we're
[time=1077] going to look at this morning, I would like for you to consider seeing this as hopefully it is
[time=1084] affirming if it isn't affirming this morning then see it as an opportunity to become affirming
[time=1091] in the future because it's it's there's some tough words here.
[time=1096] Well I was looking this week Nancy and I even looked this morning for a song that that I was
[time=1109] trying to find among RCDs, Nancy I know now why I couldn't find it, Kelly informed me this morning,
[time=1115] it was 1991, I thought it was like 2003 okay and and it's a song, it's a song that Stephen Curtis
[time=1127] Chapman did, it's actually an album that he did and he had Chuck Colson introduce the song
[time=1135] that is the title song of the album and the song is called Heaven in the real world
[time=1142] and there's a there's a segment there that I want you to listen to, I didn't have it first hour because I wasn't smart enough to find out what it was but these guys are so good and Kelly just
[time=1153] suggested that they find it so we're going to listen to it, now would you listen to Chuck Colson he introduces Heaven in the real world
[time=1187] there is a whole group of people in the whole world, an each lesson, we have a system where our walls are fast forward, our white things, we do as a nation, our hope is in the power of God working through the hearts of people, that's where our hope is in the spring, that's where our hope is in the spring, that's where our hope is in the spring.
[time=1213] Kind of hate to stop, I'd like to listen to that, you know Chuck Colson says where is the hope?
[time=1218] Well the good news is the hope isn't a place, it's not the answer to the question of where
[time=1228] and he clarifies that, hope is answered in whom, it's in the person of Christ, God the Father,
[time=1240] Son and Holy Spirit and the redeeming work that he's done to to actually give us hope for the present because of the future,
[time=1248] sometimes the present isn't so good and we can still experience hope in that and this passage of scripture
[time=1260] helps us answer some questions that might be asked on a test about your hope.
[time=1268] Let's review for a minute, we've been looking at tests this in the book of 1 John and Kelly taught us about the test of a proper review of Christ
[time=1280] and then he and I together got to do part of the test of obedience and then the test of love,
[time=1287] both the positive ways that you express love and what you shouldn't do, both in that test of love and in verses 15 through 17 of chapter 2 and then last week
[time=1297] the test of an enduring faith and now the test of hope.
[time=1302] These are all tests, they're tests because they're passages of scripture that draw our attention
[time=1312] to some questions that we can answer that will help us know that we're in Christ
[time=1321] and so here we go with a test regarding your hope. Hope, hope is joyful, confident,
[time=1333] expectation of my eternal salvation. That was in Webster's. Now it happened to be the Christian
[time=1343] definition, you know, they said this is the Christian definition but it's the, isn't that incredible? My hope is joyful, confident, expectation about my eternal salvation and that makes me
[time=1359] behave a whole lot different here. That gives me the opportunity to behave a whole lot different
[time=1366] here to honor him because I'm expecting the reality of my presence with him forever, changes
[time=1374] everything. So this morning, I'm just, I'm really hopeful that you'll pass this test of hope
[time=1382] and even if it makes you squirm a bit, maybe the next time you take it, you won't squirm
[time=1389] quite so much because we've got to go through this. Wouldn't that be good? What an opportunity we have to look at this passage of scripture together. So let's stand up and we'll read it.
[time=1399] It's 1 John 2 verse 28 through chapter 3 verse 3 and this is in the NIV and now dear children
[time=1409] continue in him so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.
[time=1416] If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of
[time=1422] him. How great is the love the Father has lavished on us that we should be called children of God
[time=1431] and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
[time=1439] Dear friends, now we are children of God and what we will be has not yet been made known
[time=1447] but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is,
[time=1455] everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure. Father in heaven.
[time=1469] We are people. We're still in our flesh.
[time=1474] We are seen as righteous by you and we're grateful for that. We want to be more right.
[time=1483] We want to act more right to bring you honor. And so I just pray that you'd help us understand
[time=1490] this passage, Lord, and I pray that we would walk out of you. I pray that every person in Christ
[time=1496] will walk out of here encouraged as a child of the living God with potential to live out
[time=1503] their hope. Please help us all do that. In the mighty name of Jesus, I pray. Amen. You may be seated.
[time=1511] Well in whom, in whom have you placed your hope? And I don't think it's a place. I think the stuff
[time=1520] that we do, the things that we do sometimes indicate who it is that we've placed our hope in. Sometimes
[time=1528] it's me. Some people have actually placed their hope in their ability to do things and get it done.
[time=1534] And sometimes people have placed their hope in other people or many people and dangerous.
[time=1545] Or have you placed your hope in the reality of God? Have you placed your hope in the fact that
[time=1555] God is? That's what he said. He said, my name, I am. Have you placed all your hope that he is God
[time=1563] and what he's revealed to us about who we are and who we can be in him? It's true.
[time=1573] If you placed your hope there, then this passage is going to crank you up. You are going to be
[time=1580] so revved up when you finish looking at this because you'll see what an incredible opportunity
[time=1587] you have in Christ to be who he wants you to be. And now, dear children, verse 28,
[time=1599] continuing him so that when he appears, we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.
[time=1604] The question I asked myself, the first question of the hope test for me was, when I look at this verse, I said, am I looking forward to his presence?
[time=1614] Am I really looking forward to his presence? Would I like for him to show up today and say,
[time=1621] hey, Steve, come over here. Am I confident this word? This says, I can be confident,
[time=1630] continue in him so that when he appears, I may be confident. If I'm continuing in him,
[time=1636] I may be confident and unashamed. The NES talks about shrinking away. They're really good
[time=1645] because that unashamed word, it means don't be the kind of person who does this deal and just wants to get away. I'll see you later. The confident person is the person. This word's really about
[time=1658] speaking forth truth. You're free to speak forth the truth because you really believe.
[time=1664] You really believe in him, of whom you speak.
[time=1669] You really speak out in your actions in ways that express to everybody around you.
[time=1676] Oh, my goodness, that person believes what they say they believe because their actions line up.
[time=1685] It's called integrity. Am I looking forward to his presence?
[time=1690] That word continue, you know, it's in John 15, abide, remain, continue, remain with expectation,
[time=1698] it means. Let's look at John 15 together just for a minute. First few verses says,
[time=1704] I am the true vine in my father is the gardener. Jesus is talking. He says, he cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit. While every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes so that it will be more fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I've spoken
[time=1720] to you. You're clean. You're righteous. You're made righteous in him. Remain in me and I will
[time=1726] remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself. It must remain in the vine.
[time=1735] Abiding. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. It's this idea of ongoing renewing
[time=1743] that takes place. We have to be in him and abiding in him. And him, he's the nourishment
[time=1750] that comes to this branch as I'm attached to the vine when I get grafted on.
[time=1755] And so when I'm abiding in him and I'm remaining in him, I'm continuing in him, then that with which he nourishes me becomes the outflowing of my life.
[time=1767] Powerful. And then are you confident? Are you openly, frankly, without concealment,
[time=1775] living a Christ-filled life in your week?
[time=1782] It's confidence is the state. It's me being certain.
[time=1788] It's me being certain. I'm certain about him.
[time=1795] Are you looking forward to his presence? In 1 Thessalonians 4, you know, it says,
[time=1802] Paul's right into the Thessalonians and he says, "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven and with the loud command, with the voice of the archangel, with the trumpet call of God, and the dead of in Christ will rise first. Believers who died are going to rise first." Then it says, "Those who remain will join them." It says, "For the Lord himself will come down with
[time=1823] the loud command, and the dead in Christ will rise first. But we who remain are still alive.
[time=1828] We're going to join and meet him together with them in the clouds." He's coming again.
[time=1835] Now, I don't think that's exactly the moment that John's talking about here, although I'm not sure.
[time=1843] He's also going to come back again and bring us with him, Revelation chapter 19.
[time=1850] He's on a white horse. He's got a sword. There's a fire coming out. It's really a great image if
[time=1856] you read that. There's a picture drawn of it. I love it so much. We're going to come with him then. I don't think that's probably the appearing that he's talking about there either. But he's also going to appear as a judge at the Great White Throne Judgment. Believers and unbelievers.
[time=1871] After the thousand-year millennium, I know this is a lot of stuff, but after he comes back on that horse and he rules here for a thousand years and we get to rule with him, then we go back
[time=1881] with him and he's going to judge. He's going to judge. God will judge all people and he'll separate
[time=1890] believers, sheep, he says, from goats, unbelievers. Then there's another judgment.
[time=1898] And this one is uncomfortable for people, but I want you to get fired up about it today because this is an opportunity. When I see the potential, what can happen in 2 Corinthians 5-10,
[time=1910] I get so cranked up for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ. Every believer
[time=1916] now is going to appear before the judgment seat of Christ. It's called the famous seat. That's that Greek word for it. And we will stand before him and it says that each one may receive what is
[time=1926] due him for the things done while in the body, whether good. That's the good news or bad. That's
[time=1934] the bad news. But I want to tell you, I'm looking forward to that thing. Now, not because I'm perfect,
[time=1944] not because I'm righteous, but I am righteous. It's not because I'm righteous that I'm looking
[time=1950] forward to that. I'm looking forward to that because I've had an opportunity for 57 years and I may have a few more. I have an opportunity to, as I'm abiding in him and he does things through
[time=1965] me, I get to be there and he'll say, "Well, this is what I was doing when that happened.
[time=1971] This is what I was doing when that happened. The rewards, I think for me, the greatest rewards is going to be just to discover how I was doing things. Most of the time, I don't have a clue what I'm doing. I'm just trying to live rightly each day and move through that. But he is going to,
[time=1988] we're going to receive rewards. We're going to receive what is due us for the work done on the flesh, whether good or bad." I hope that excites you. But if it doesn't, it can.
[time=2000] It can because it's just to the degree to which I'm abiding. It's not to the degree to which I'm
[time=2011] working. It's not the degree to which I'm not doing this or just doing that because in my flesh,
[time=2017] I just decide to do it. It's to the degree that I'm yielded to him and I'm abiding in him
[time=2023] that he gets expressed in good works. That's amazing.
[time=2029] Then verse 29 says, "If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does
[time=2039] what is right has been born of him." That's an interesting one. So then I'm asking myself, okay, am I doing what's right? The answer, no. I don't like that answer. But the truth of it is,
[time=2052] I don't always do what is right. So if you know that he is righteous, then I do know that.
[time=2060] You know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him. It doesn't say the test isn't
[time=2068] Steve. Have you been doing what's right all the time? The test is, can you observe his righteousness
[time=2075] in people? The answer, yes. And I'd hope you could observe his righteousness in my acts.
[time=2084] And I'm just here to tell you, I know any good thing I ever do is him because I know me better
[time=2093] than you do. It's him. I'm the most selfish person I know because I'm the only person I know.
[time=2104] Am I righteous? He says you'll know them by their fruits. Righteous. Righteous means observing
[time=2117] divine law, keeping the law perfectly. He did. As a man, the Lord Jesus as a man obeyed it all.
[time=2125] He kept it all. He didn't break any commandments. And then he took my death. I mean, my sin on him
[time=2132] and died. So my righteousness is the state in which I ought to be. It's the condition in which
[time=2144] I ought to be. And in him, I am. In him, I am righteous. That's what's exciting about this.
[time=2152] Look at 2 Corinthians 5, 21. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might
[time=2163] become the righteousness of God. Look at Matthew 7, Matthew 7, 16-18.
[time=2170] "By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from
[time=2179] thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree
[time=2187] cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. When you inspect the fruit of our lives, I'm talking about not a piece of fruit. I'm talking about the fruit.
[time=2197] When you inspect the fruit of our lives, when people inspect the fruit of your life, are they seeing fruit that's produced by the nourishment that comes from the vine?
[time=2210] Or are they seeing fruit that's produced by you?" Now that's a good question. And here's the truth.
[time=2221] They can't tell the difference. A lot of people can't tell the difference, but anything righteous that comes out of me, you can guarantee it came from him.
[time=2230] Are you bearing fruit that resembles the source from which it comes?
[time=2245] It shows up in unusual ways. You know, with those two verses together,
[time=2251] I just thought about Paul. I thought Paul on the road to Damascus, Paul got blinded by Jesus.
[time=2256] The last thing he saw was the light of Christ before he got blinded. Then he's blinded.
[time=2262] And from then on, he can't wait to see him who blinded him. What an interesting thing.
[time=2273] Oh, he blinded me. Man, I can't wait to see who that is. I can't wait to see him. To live his Christ and to die is gain. Nancy gets mad at me sometimes because I get all fired up about dying
[time=2286] sometimes. And I get a little jealous sometimes. Sometimes there are people that they're going through some health issues and it looks like they're going to die. I know this sounds a little morbid, but sometimes I see that and I go, man, I have finished well if I could go now. I want
[time=2304] to finish well. There's a little bit of, and I want to be like him. I want to see him as he is.
[time=2309] I'm looking forward to that so much. It's not that I don't love Nancy or her fine cooking. I love it.
[time=2313] My life's good. It's wonderful. But it's nothing compared to what we're going to experience
[time=2320] when we get to be with him. So the question I'm asking myself is, am I looking forward to his
[time=2328] presence? And am I doing right things now because I'm looking forward to his presence?
[time=2336] Chapter three, verse one, "How great is the love the Father has lavished on us
[time=2342] that we should be called children of God, and that is what we are. We're children of God.
[time=2349] The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him." This is really interesting
[time=2356] because that word no, there's some stuff going on there that's more than just
[time=2364] knowing about somebody, recognizing them when you see their face, being able to call them by name.
[time=2371] The world does not know us, doesn't get it. The world doesn't get you
[time=2379] because they don't get him. It would be a really good way to think about that.
[time=2385] Now here we're not talking about an individual person in the world.
[time=2391] He uses the world on purpose. The world represents the culture of this world that takes a lot of
[time=2398] different forms. You know them, materialism, sex, position, all that stuff. The stuff that's
[time=2408] natural for me to conform to, it's all of that. There are people who really represent that and
[time=2417] promote that. Usually it's for their benefit. No, not always it's for their benefit somehow.
[time=2426] They don't like us. They tell us things like you are closed-minded. You need to expand your thinking.
[time=2439] You are legalistic because we believe there are some absolutes. You see, a righteous person
[time=2449] who's plugged into the source, the life source, the bread of life, the living water, or plugged into
[time=2458] that, our minds get different and we become more like him and if they didn't like him,
[time=2466] they're not going to like us. Now, are we supposed to love them individually? Absolutely.
[time=2472] They're created in the image of God. Do we love the system that they're promoting? Absolutely not.
[time=2480] I'm opposed to that system and I'll stand against that system and they'll say things like you're
[time=2486] strange. You're an alien. Where did you come from? And 1 Peter chapter 2 says that's a really good
[time=2496] thing when people recognize that you don't belong here.
[time=2504] Verse 1 made me think, am I conscious? Am I really conscious? Am I conscious as I move
[time=2511] in this world's culture? I'm in it. As am I conscious as I move through this culture
[time=2517] of the fact that I'm his child, not this world's child. Am I conscious? A test my hope? Is
[time=2526] am I God conscious that he's my father? How great's the love the father has lavished on? That's
[time=2533] that agape love. That's that he loves us. We don't deserve it at all but he just loves us as a father
[time=2540] because he's adopted us. That we should be called children of God and that's what we are.
[time=2544] The reason the world doesn't understand us or get us. So here's a question. Do they get you?
[time=2550] Do you fit in? Is it just? Now, I'm not saying you need to be an odd ball and never fit in and
[time=2558] beat him up with the Bible. You know that. I'm just talking about, they should be saying, why are you a bit different? That's what 1 Peter 3 is about. Be ready to give an answer for the hope that's in you. Somebody, for one thing, our hope should be so expressed that they're going,
[time=2574] I want that. Where does that come from? When they see us in love with each other and living out a hope-filled life, you know when it shows up? It shows up when you're dying in the
[time=2587] hospital and I come and visit with you and we are in there in hope and nurses and other people
[time=2596] observe that and say, what's going on? That's different. They're not weeping and wailing and gnashing teeth. They're grieving with hope, not as those who have no hope for thessalonians.
[time=2605] So they see that stuff. Anybody been asking you lately? Why you have hope? That's a good question
[time=2616] to ask yourself. They don't ask me often enough. Look at John 15, 18, and 19. If the world hates you,
[time=2624] Jesus said, if the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
[time=2631] If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world,
[time=2640] but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. This world culture,
[time=2646] they don't like the stuff that goes on in here. They don't like it. They'll try to shut us down if
[time=2655] they can because this, what God teaches, is antithetical to everything that the world stands for.
[time=2670] Am I understood by the world? Do I live in such a way that they're wondering about me?
[time=2678] Good question. Then chapter 3, verse 2 says, dear friends, now we are children of God.
[time=2686] And what we will be has not yet been made known. You know what? You don't even know your name.
[time=2698] He said he has a name that he's written on a stone. It's in Revelation. It might be the one
[time=2705] in the Lamb's book of life. You don't even know it yet. He says, dear friends, now we are children
[time=2711] of God and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. That's incredible. I'm going to be like him
[time=2725] because I'll see him as he is. I'll bet you that somehow that means I'm going to go, oh my,
[time=2731] I want to be that. And when I'm that humble, when I'm that broken,
[time=2739] he makes me like him because I'm not me anymore. I don't know what it means about supernatural
[time=2749] powers and what I'm going to know and all those things, but I know this. I believe in his presence.
[time=2754] I'm going to be down. That's happened so many times in the Old Testament when a type of Christ
[time=2761] showed up. Bang, they're down. I don't think I'll be able to be standing up. You know, every knee shall bow and every tongue confess. And the good news for us is those who are righteous through the
[time=2774] blood of Christ, that's going to be an incredibly wonderful time. But when we know that, but we know
[time=2784] that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. It's veiled right now.
[time=2792] This is all the truth I need to know, but there's a lot more. There's stuff I don't know. There are
[time=2800] things behind all this that I don't know. And all I'm going to understand some things about him
[time=2807] then that will just absolutely drive me to my knees. My question for you is, are you on your knees
[time=2816] now? Are you on your knees now because of who he is? Is your heart so affected that you're broken
[time=2832] in contract before him and you're empowered by him to be like him because you're on your knees?
[time=2843] Look at Romans 8 with me together. Romans 8, 14, 15, and 18. Romans 8 says,
[time=2851] "Because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive a spirit
[time=2857] that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship, and by him we cry,
[time=2864] "Abba, Father." I'm not a slave to my sin. I'm not a slave to the culture of this world
[time=2876] because I have a father who's conquered all that. And when I feel like I'm embraced,
[time=2886] I love to hug Kelly. I've told you that before. When he hugs me, I feel like I'm getting hugged my mom and dad and I'm 12. I have to close my eyes to do that. But that's the kind of, oh my goodness,
[time=2898] I just bask in the fatherhood of God in my life. I can cry out, "Abba, daddy,
[time=2904] dad, father, because I received the Spirit of sonship through Christ."
[time=2919] The last verse in this section says, verse 3 of chapter 3, it says, "Everyone who has this hope
[time=2927] in him purifies himself just as he is pure." Now that's a scary one.
[time=2935] "Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure."
[time=2944] Question? Are you purifying yourself?
[time=2948] Remember, hope is joyful, confident, expectation of eternal salvation. That part done.
[time=2963] Now because my hope is in him for that, he says, "Oh, you're one of my sons, purify yourself."
[time=2974] That word for purified one, it shows up in lots of different ways, but there's a Greek root word
[time=2989] that a whole bunch of words come out of, "pure, holy, other."
[time=2995] And that word, it's an incredible word. I'm not exactly sure,
[time=3005] how this plays out, but let me just offer this to you. The root word that often is
[time=3013] translated wholly different, pure, the root word is really the word for awful.
[time=3026] A-W-F-U-L, awful. And I'm thinking, how can that be? And then I'm thinking, oh my,
[time=3033] I'm full of all over him. He's totally something other than what I can be,
[time=3044] unless I'm in him, I am totally, utterly all struck by his awfulness. There's something about that,
[time=3054] the beginning of wisdom is fear. There's an awfulness about him that's a wonderful awfulness.
[time=3061] And he says that I need to be holy, first Peter chapter one, be holy as he's holy.
[time=3069] Here, purify myself. Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure.
[time=3079] Are you in the purification process? It's not, are you pure? Have you engaged in being set apart,
[time=3090] sanctification? Are you being purified? Do you seem more pure today than you did five years ago
[time=3097] or 10 years ago? That's a good question to ask yourself. It's wonderful to ask yourself.
[time=3101] And to know that, by his power, I can be more pure next year.
[time=3109] Let's look at 2 Corinthians 7-1. Since we have these promises, dear friends,
[time=3121] let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
[time=3129] Are you reverent toward God? Am I reverent toward God? Am I God conscious through my week?
[time=3137] Am I making choices? Yes and no choices, because I'm aware of him, I'm conscious of him,
[time=3143] and I want to be more right. That's the thing to ask.
[time=3146] Well, I was trying to think about an illustration. I wanted somebody that I could just say, "This person is that hope-filled person." And I came up with some people in my mind that I know and some people I'd heard about. But then what happened to me yesterday was this.
[time=3162] I just, and I hope that the Lord's honored with this, I just thought, you know, I've been closest to hope-filled people here. You're the people I've watched live lives of hope,
[time=3175] and the people that were across the street, so however long it's been since 1979, I've been watching people at Black Hawk that are filled with hope.
[time=3183] And I watch them, and it shows up in all kinds of ways. Now, get this.
[time=3189] Some of this may sound like something you don't want to hear because of what you used to be.
[time=3194] Forget that. He's forgiven you that. Enjoy this.
[time=3198] Sometimes it's the chronically ill who think eternally rather than temporally.
[time=3208] I've watched hope-filled people with awful chronic illnesses live lives of joy.
[time=3215] It's amazing. I've seen the people in wheelchairs that smile, and I've seen the people able to jump and dunk a basketball who don't.
[time=3226] I've seen spouses who stay the course and children who stay the course with a spouse in the mix
[time=3238] that isn't doing it right because of their hope. You see, some people understand it's not about
[time=3247] today. They have an eternal hope, so today is an opportunity. I've seen grieving,
[time=3255] really grieving people, grieve with hope, and I've seen you go to grieving people
[time=3263] when you didn't want to go because you wanted to grieve with them with hope.
[time=3269] You know how powerful that is. You know the times when you don't want to go,
[time=3275] when you don't, you know how received that is when people are grieving and hurting and sick and
[time=3282] whatever, and you just show up and it doesn't matter what you say, but you have hope and then
[time=3288] you encourage them. I've seen employees who worship at work doing excellent work for lousy employers
[time=3297] who don't treat them well because they're filled with hope. I've seen employers who don't treat
[time=3305] their employees well, but I've also seen employers that treat their employees really well because they
[time=3312] have hope. I've seen children look for opportunities to submit to bad parenting, to keep peace in a
[time=3324] house because they have hope. I've seen the poor, focus on hope they have rather than the hunger
[time=3338] that they feel, and I've seen the rich focus on what they can give rather than what they can keep
[time=3348] because of their hope. I've seen a lot of hope filled people
[time=3354] and I want to be like that. I just want to be
[time=3364] aware of my adoption, aware of him who is it is that made me righteous. I want to make my choices
[time=3376] this week at work, at home, in the neighborhood, every place I go, I want to make my choices in a
[time=3382] way that express my hope in him. And this passage says we have the opportunity to do that. We can do
[time=3394] that in Christ. Are you hope filled with the person of Christ? That's the ultimate question.
[time=3405] Father in heaven, I pray, I pray that we can answer that question. Yes, I can Lord. I am hope
[time=3420] filled only because you are my hope. And I'm surrounded by people in this room that I observe
[time=3428] that aren't perfect, Lord. We're just, we mess up in our flesh, but our hope is in you
[time=3435] and your forgiveness. And we want to be more right to honor you. We want to be able to stand
[time=3445] before you and have you say that was good, what you did. And I thank you that we have the opportunity
[time=3453] to do that. I thank you for this passage of Scripture. We know we are utterly dependent on you
[time=3459] for any rightness in us. And so we thank you that you've chosen to fill us so we can do that.
[time=3469] We're in all of you, our God. In Christ's name, I pray. Amen.
