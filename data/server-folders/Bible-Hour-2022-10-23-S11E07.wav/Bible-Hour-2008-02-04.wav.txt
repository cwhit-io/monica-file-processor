[time=301] Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=304] My name's Kelly and I have the privilege of serving as senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we are thankful.
[time=310] If you're tuning in for the first time to the Bible Hour, we are so grateful to be able to share this with you.
[time=316] And if you're a regular here with the broadcast, welcome again.
[time=320] As you know, we're privileged to be able to have a relationship and a partnership with you.
[time=326] We want nothing more than to encourage you in your relationship with the Lord or encourage you in your journey toward that relationship with him.
[time=335] You know, last night I was out in Huntington, Indiana at one of my favorite places in the world,
[time=341] and we went to church out there in Huntington called Union Church, and got a really good friend, Jeff Carroll, who's the pastor out there.
[time=348] And it just was an incredible encouragement to be with those people at their Saturday night service,
[time=354] and to talk with so many of them who watched the Bible Hour, and that's what's so encouraging for us.
[time=361] You know, we're not in the competition business here at Black Hawk.
[time=364] We're trying to collaborate. We're trying to work with.
[time=367] We're trying to partner with local churches, because when they win, when they succeed, when their mission gets accomplished, we feel like we do.
[time=376] And so to know that there's so many people in Huntington, for instance, who get encouraged week after week to see a church like Union Church doing so well because of God's grace and his hand on their ministry, and to know that we get to partner in that and share in that, it means a great deal.
[time=391] So I just want to say thank you to all of you who watch.
[time=394] Many of you have home churches, and to know that we get to play a small part in your spiritual walk,
[time=400] and hopefully it's a spiritual walk, yours.
[time=403] Hopefully that's even making that local church stronger and more effective as that church tries to do what God's called it to do.
[time=412] We find it absolutely thrilling to be able to be a part of that with you.
[time=416] So God bless you. We hope you'll stay faithful and keep at it.
[time=419] Hey, I want to come back at the end of the broadcast today.
[time=422] Don't go away. Watch this thing all the way to the end.
[time=425] You're going to see something today very special that we're embarking upon here at Blackhawk.
[time=430] Over the next six weeks, we're going to be engaging in something that we want you to not only be aware of,
[time=437] but we want you to participate with us, and it has to do with what's coming in about six weeks,
[time=443] the crucifixion and the resurrection of our Lord.
[time=447] We're going to come at that in a very unique and special way here at Blackhawk.
[time=450] And I want you, the Bible Hour viewer, to participate with us, so stick around.
[time=455] And at the end of the broadcast, I'll come back and share with you a couple of really important things, some ways that you can be a part of this with us in the days to come. Thanks.
[time=480] [MUSIC - 111 seconds]
[time=604] â™ª
[time=629] I've noticed over the last few years that my oldest son, who's 15, has this thing about flying. I suppose you could call it a fear, but really I think it's just nerves, a lot of questions and his need to know.
[time=641] You see, he's cautious and he just likes to have things figured out.
[time=645] We may have a trip plan, for instance, involving a flight and light clockwork.
[time=649] Every single time, about a week before the flight, he'll just start randomly asking the greatest questions.
[time=656] We'll be in the car coming home from a practice, talking about basketball or friends, and he'll just blurt out, "Hey Dad, how much fuel does a plane actually need to get to Florida?"
[time=667] Or one time I remember I was sitting by his bed at night and he just looked at me very seriously and said,
[time=673] "Dad, do airlines hire like backup pilots for each flight in case something happens to the regular ones?"
[time=680] You get him inside one week before a flight and these are the conversations you'll have.
[time=685] Fuel capacity and backup pilots, all in an effort to just get himself ready to fly.
[time=691] We prepare for things, don't we?
[time=694] Whether it's retirement, a new baby on the way, an interview, some things are just worth getting ready for.
[time=701] You know, it struck me recently as I was reading through one of the gospel accounts that Jesus' demeanor
[time=707] actually starts to change the closer he gets to Jerusalem.
[time=711] That's right, the closer he gets to the cross.
[time=714] The closer he gets to the appointed time and place of his death, you get the sense that he's more and more mindful of it.
[time=721] His tone changes, his demeanor is altered.
[time=724] At points his questions get more direct and more pointed, his spirit seems to get just a little bit heavier.
[time=730] One gets the impression that at a certain point in time Jesus is actually beginning to prepare for what's going to happen.
[time=738] He's going to die a brutal death and in the process bring redemption to a broken world.
[time=743] And as you watch this divine drama unfold, you get the sense that he's not going to approach it mindlessly.
[time=749] He's not going to ignore it or dismiss it, he's actually instead going to embrace it.
[time=755] It's reality, it's inevitability and in the process slowly get ready for it.
[time=760] Jesus prepares for his death.
[time=763] So why wouldn't we?
[time=765] Why wouldn't we prepare to remember and honor his sacrifice?
[time=769] Why wouldn't we together prepare to remember his death?
[time=774] Well here at Blackhawk, over these next six weeks we're going to invite every one of you to join us as we prepare for the reality of the crucifixion and the great joy of the resurrection.
[time=785] We'll do this as a family as we gather each week in our worship services and we'll do it privately or personally as we go through the everyday of life away from the Sunday morning setting.
[time=797] We're calling it the preparation and our hope is that six weeks from now as we gather on good Friday evening
[time=803] every heart, every mind, body and soul will be ready.
[time=808] Better prepared to experience the redeeming sacrifice of our Lord.
[time=814] Well it's my hope, it's our hope as a leadership here at Blackhawk that the thought of that would be inviting to you.
[time=823] We've given it a lot of prayer and already a lot of work has been done to bring to you as a family this opportunity to prepare ourselves, like I said there,
[time=835] in heart, mind, body and soul to actually together as a family everybody that calls Blackhawk home.
[time=843] The invitation is being laid out there for you today to give yourself, would you give yourself to this kind of an effort
[time=850] to prepare ourselves for the great celebration of what Christ did there on Good Friday
[time=856] and the great, great celebration of the defeat of death, the empty tomb on Resurrection Sunday morning.
[time=864] We have an amazing capacity, we really do, God has, I think, wired each of us with this incredible ability to anticipate
[time=874] and to prepare for things.
[time=877] There are some in the room this morning who could tell me right now if I ask them how many days there are until spring break.
[time=886] I know you're here, somebody just yell it out, I know you can tell me, how many days till spring break?
[time=892] How many? 21, thanks. 21 days till spring break.
[time=896] Many of you in the room can feel, you can feel whether you're going this year or not.
[time=900] Many of you in the room can feel right now with it being minus a gazillion degrees outside.
[time=905] You can feel your toes in the sand, you can listen, you can right now close your eyes and hear the sound of a wave crashing.
[time=912] You can feel the warmth of the sun on the back of your neck as you sit there in a lounge chair and read a book.
[time=918] You can, you've been there, you know about it and there is this ability that we have to anticipate it, it's uncanny.
[time=927] It may be a grandmother's kitchen, it might be a special vacation place that you go as a family.
[time=935] There are these people, there are these places and we know what it's like and we've been there, we can close our eyes and we can hear it, we can smell it, we can feel it, we can taste it.
[time=945] It's coming and we know what it's like. There's this anticipation, this preparation ability that God gives us.
[time=951] It's an amazing thing and we want to this morning, I want to personally invite you.
[time=956] I invited everybody in first hour, did an insert this morning back in the studio inviting everybody who watches on the broadcast.
[time=963] I want us as a family to seriously give thought to what the next six weeks could look like if you and I
[time=970] corporately as a body gathered and then personally in the everyday of your life and mind, if we were willing to make this kind of a commitment to prepare ourselves for what is to come,
[time=981] I think there would be enormous glory and honor given to God in the process.
[time=987] I think there would be enormous benefit for you and I personally in our relationship with him in our understanding of this great sacrifice that he made.
[time=997] I think there would be incredible benefit for us as a family if we would give ourselves to something like this together.
[time=1005] And so I just real quick what, why and where, I just had him put it on the screen for you, what the preparation,
[time=1011] what is it, it is an intentional six-week effort, a very intentional and as you'll see here in a moment,
[time=1017] I'm going to lay this out for you, very intensive in some ways.
[time=1022] What I'm about to share with you and what I'm about to actually invite you to is something I've never, ever invited you to
[time=1029] in the years gone by that we've been together.
[time=1032] I'm going to ask you this morning to a level of involvement, to a kind of participation that we've never, ever asked of you.
[time=1041] And I'm extremely grateful and very much looking forward to it, an intentional, a very intensive six-week effort
[time=1049] to prepare our minds and our souls for this incredible celebration of life and forgiveness.
[time=1058] Why? Why would we do this? Why would we put aside six weeks and invite you to this intentional and very intensive six-week opportunity?
[time=1072] Why would we give this much time? Why would we make this much of an effort? Why would I stand here this morning and make this big a deal?
[time=1079] Well, the answer is because I believe we believe it's a very, very big deal.
[time=1083] I'll tell you what, there probably aren't, you know what, there's probably nobody in the room this morning.
[time=1091] You know, maybe somebody just showed up from, I don't know, a month in an igloo in Alaska.
[time=1097] But if you've been alive in the last month, probably everybody in this room can tell me who played in the Super Bowl.
[time=1104] You may not even be a sports fan. You may hate football.
[time=1109] You may have absolutely no interest in that game, but almost every single one of you can tell me who played in that game.
[time=1118] Most of you can tell me what was at stake. Most of you can tell me who the team was that was almost on the verge of a perfect season.
[time=1126] Most of you in the room could tell me what team it was in 1973 who had the last perfect season.
[time=1132] Most of you could tell me the quarterback for the Giants and most of you could tell me the quarterback for the Patriots.
[time=1138] And a bunch of you could probably even tell me who the quarterback of the Patriots is dating because, and you could tell me all the above because it's all we heard.
[time=1146] It's all we saw. It's all that got put in front of us everywhere you went for those 14 days.
[time=1152] And may I add, those were a glorious 14 days.
[time=1156] Was that? Because it was such a big deal.
[time=1162] And everywhere you went and everywhere you looked, it was what was being talked about. It was what was being thought about.
[time=1170] And I love the Super Bowl, and I'm a huge sports fan.
[time=1174] This my friends, the crucifixion of our Lord, and his sacrifice on your behalf, the death of the Son of God, fulfilled so that you and I might have life and hope and forgiveness.
[time=1191] The glorious defeat of death manifested there in the empty tomb and the great celebration of life.
[time=1199] That's huge. That's bigger than the bowl. It's bigger than anything. It is enormous.
[time=1206] And so what? What is an intentional six-week effort to prepare our hearts and minds for this glorious event? Why?
[time=1214] Because it's worthy of that kind of effort and that kind of thought and your willingness in mind to jump in here and give ourselves to something, maybe many of us in the room have never before done.
[time=1226] Where in our gathering here on Sunday mornings, over the next six weeks, we're not going to give all of the time in each of those Sunday mornings.
[time=1235] We're going to give a decent segment though of the time.
[time=1238] As we continue to make our way through 1 John, we're going to give a pretty decent chunk of time in those gatherings each week to giving us the opportunity to again be reminded.
[time=1249] There will be symbols and there will be sometimes a prayer and there will be some scripture reading.
[time=1255] There will be efforts on our part to engage everybody in the room again week after week.
[time=1260] And I'll show you a little bit more of that later. But not only in our gathering, but there's going to be a chance for you.
[time=1265] And this is what I want to talk to you about this morning. There's going to be a chance for you to personally.
[time=1270] If you're willing to raise your hand this morning and say, "You know what? I'll give myself to this with you, Kelly, and with our church."
[time=1278] There's going to be a personal component to this that I think is absolutely maybe one of the most significant things as it relates to preparing for this great day that we've ever, ever given you the chance to do.
[time=1291] And I want to talk to you about that this morning just for a moment if I can.
[time=1294] And it just kind of comes under the heading of our, or really your, our commitment, your commitment, mine.
[time=1300] I want you to know I've made this commitment. Everything I'm about to tell you, everything I'm about to share with you, I've personally committed to myself.
[time=1310] And my hope is that you would join me and that we could together experience this preparation.
[time=1317] Number one, I'm going to ask you, we're going to ask you to give yourself over the next six weeks to maybe a level of scripture reading.
[time=1325] Maybe a level of taking in and digesting God's word, a level of that that maybe some of you in the room have never experienced.
[time=1333] Greeters, would you come on down? I want to, uh, greeters come on down and, and if you would pass out these cards, what we've got for you here is this isn't real fancy.
[time=1342] It's very well done. I'm so thankful for the team. They did great, but it's just a very simple way that we wanted to put into your hands an opportunity for you to make a six week kind of every, every day commitment.
[time=1354] Between now today and the end of the six weeks as we come to Resurrection Sunday, these cards kind of held together by a little key ring here.
[time=1363] These cards give you, if you're willing to do this with us, the chance to, number one, allow God's word to guide you and allow God's word to encourage you, allow God's word to speak to you along some very specific lines, along some very specific themes that will help you,
[time=1382] and will help me as we prepare to give ourselves to this preparation.
[time=1387] I can't wait for you to see it. I'm so thankful. There's a lady in our church who is part of our family and took some time that she probably really didn't even have.
[time=1397] She had a lot going on, but I tell you what, she gave herself completely to this. I asked her for her help, and she came up with these themes that you see here on each card.
[time=1407] Each card represents a week. There is a week of service, a week of sacrifice, a week of shame, a week of sweet sorrow, a week of suffering, a week of submission, and then sovereignty being that last card.
[time=1423] And with each card, my friends, as you get them, you'll see, you turn the card over, and on the back of the card is an opportunity for you on a daily basis to put aside some time, to put aside maybe 15, 20, 30 minutes, and really in a quiet place with some real intentionality on your part,
[time=1445] to read and to soak up and to take in the great truth of God's Word as it relates to these things that you see here on the front of each card.
[time=1456] Daily, a commitment on your part over this six-week span to give yourselves to some time of daily Scripture reading.
[time=1464] You know what, my friends? Anytime I--there isn't really hardly ever a time where I'm not reading in the Scripture where God doesn't bring something to my heart, God doesn't bring something to my mind.
[time=1474] There are so many times that questions arise. I've got a pin nearby, and as I read and as I think and as I pray, I'll write things down.
[time=1483] Questions I want to ask others to help me think through issues I think I need addressed in my own heart and life.
[time=1489] I would just thoroughly encourage you to, as you grab one of these packets of cards to be willing today to make a six-week commitment with the Good Friday Resurrection Sunday weekend in view to give yourself to a time of reading and reflection that would really, I think, God could really use to encourage your heart and soul.
[time=1513] Everybody get one? Now, here's the thing, you got one this morning. Maybe you could pick up an extra one or two on the way out. I believe we have some extras.
[time=1522] I'll tell you more about this later, but on our website, just so you know now, on our website, if you click on the preparation at BlackHawkMinistries.org, if you click on the preparation, all of this reading material is available online.
[time=1537] So, if there's somebody who's maybe not here that you would love to invite to join us as we prepare, you can invite them to go to the website and they can get all of these verses.
[time=1546] You know what? As you look at these verses, go ahead. Everybody look at week one service. This begins today. If you're in with us, this begins today. Look at week one, Sunday, Isaiah 40, 12 to 31, John 13, 1 to 17.
[time=1563] That may sound to many of you in the room. Is that what yours says? On the card that says service, based on in picture, you turn it over to Sunday, Isaiah 40, John 13. That may seem aggressive.
[time=1577] That may seem like a lot to some of you. And I just want to say, I think that's okay. I would love to just lovingly encourage you to give it a shot.
[time=1587] And to open your heart and mind and your soul to what God may have for you as you give yourself to the discipline of taking in his word. David said, "Thy word, I have hid in my heart so that I may not sin against thee."
[time=1601] Later in the Psalms, it says, "It's a light unto my feet, a lamp unto my path." You know, my friends, that is just a joy and a blessing that you and I have, the privilege of experiencing when we get to take in the great truth of God's word.
[time=1613] So the first part of your commitment, the first part of our commitment individually and as a body is to say, "You know what? I would be willing to give myself to daily Scripture reading."
[time=1624] Second part, three parts to this commitment. Second part would be, and this is something that maybe many of you in the room have not experienced, maybe many of you in the room have never even really understood it completely as to what it's about or what it really means, but it would be a commitment to fasting and prayer.
[time=1642] A commitment to fasting and prayer. And I had him put fasting/prayer because again and again and again in the Scriptures, wherever you see this spiritual discipline of fasting.
[time=1655] So many times you see connected to it the spiritual discipline and the privilege of prayer.
[time=1661] And there's some things about fasting. I just wanted to take a moment. We came up with, I think when I say fasting, I'm sure one of the first things that popped into your head was food.
[time=1670] And while I understand that and I want to come back and talk to you about that, I want to just give you a couple of, and I think in the Scriptures as we think about fasting, yes, absolutely.
[time=1680] In the scriptural examples of fasting, what is being fasted, what they are going without in these cases was food.
[time=1689] And I want to just give you a definition real quick, there were hundreds of them, I just liked this one, fasting to go without.
[time=1695] In an effort to remember the fullness, I love that. To go without, in an effort to remember the fullness that only God can bring.
[time=1708] Right there with the picture or thought of fasting comes the picture or thought of being what? Hungry.
[time=1715] Picture or thought of being thirsty. And it is the going without and the hunger that that creates that fasting gives us the opportunity to with that hunger.
[time=1726] Be mindful of and be thoughtful of and be focused on the fact that while I'm physically hungry for food, it is a great reminder, a great segue into the spiritual arena of how God is the only one who can truly fill me up.
[time=1742] And these times of fasting allow for you and I times to remember the fullness that only God can bring.
[time=1752] Fasting, I just had the folks put a few things on the screen for you, it is in the scriptures, fasting is seen as a regular discipline, Matthew 6, 16, a regular discipline.
[time=1766] Turn in your Bibles, if you would, to Matthew 6, 16.
[time=1771] It says there, I'm going to read this whole thing to you, but I want to bring you back to the first line here in just a moment.
[time=1778] Whenever you fast, whenever you fast, the Lord says do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting.
[time=1791] Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full, right there they've spent their reward in other words, but verse 17, but you when you fast Christ says, here's the way I want you to do it.
[time=1801] When you fast, anoint your head and wash your face so that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by your father who is in secret and your father who sees what is done, he sees your fasting and in secret will reward you.
[time=1819] And I want to take you back to that first line, verse 16, whenever you fast, my friend's there in the, you can see it right there in the English, it's clear in the Greek, it is assumed.
[time=1830] It's not if you fast, it's what?
[time=1833] It's when you fast.
[time=1836] He clearly here and in other places we see that those who are his and those who follow him.
[time=1843] And here we are in Matthew 6, which is right in the middle of what was Matthew 5, 6 and 7 called the Sermon on the Mount, and the Sermon on the Mount is really this fundamental foundational message.
[time=1859] Sermon, where Christ lays out the basics of living out this faith, and right there it says in 6, 16, whenever you fast, assuming that you are giving yourself to this discipline.
[time=1873] He says, make sure you do it humbly, make sure you don't draw attention to yourself, make sure you don't walk around with a sign that says, hey everybody, I'm fasting.
[time=1883] Those who do that, he says, spend their reward.
[time=1888] I want you to see first of all that fasting was a regular discipline of those who knew and followed him.
[time=1894] So much to say on this, let me just give you a few things, fasting in the scriptures was oftentimes connected to sadness, you can write that down.
[time=1903] Fasting was oftentimes connected to sadness, you can write down Matthew 9, I think it's 15 if I'm not mistaken.
[time=1911] Matthew 9, 15, 16, somewhere in there it talks about Jesus is talking about his disciples and his followers and how while he was the bridegroom Christ, while he was with them they were happy, but he said that there will be a day when he wouldn't be with them, a time when they would be sad, a time when they would be overcome with grief.
[time=1931] And he says, at the point in time when they are not with me, then they will go and fast.
[time=1937] It's a very interesting concept my friends, fasting, getting in touch with the emptiness, getting in touch with the fact, remembering the fullness that only God can bring, fasting here connected to sadness.
[time=1951] Oftentimes in our sadness we want to go fill ourselves with that which doesn't last, right?
[time=1960] Here we see fasting being a way that we can take sadness and navigate those times in a way that really brings great glory and honor to God.
[time=1971] And it can in a very acute way it can remind us of our emptiness and where that sadness can go if we don't rely upon run to and experience the fullness that only he can bring.
[time=1985] Oftentimes you see fasting connected to times of sadness and ability to be reminded of the fullness that he brings in the midst of hurt, trial and difficulty.
[time=1997] Again as you go through scriptures you see fasting connected to prayer right down Matthew 17, 21.
[time=2003] I mentioned that to you earlier again and again and again we see fasting connected to times of prayer.
[time=2008] It's a pretty simple but pretty profound thought when you're fasting, when you're not eating, when you're going without and that hunger gets created at those times.
[time=2017] And many of you have missed a meal, raise your hand if you've missed a meal.
[time=2021] Alright so we've all fasted intentionally or unintentionally. Anytime you miss a meal maybe you've fasted from food for a day I don't know but you know that you'll be going along just kind of doing fine, busy at work, busy at home and all of a sudden boom it hit you.
[time=2036] All of a sudden you realize I didn't eat lunch, all of a sudden you realize I didn't get breakfast, I'm starving.
[time=2045] And then what do we do right there? Right then, right there is an opportunity for me not to go to the cereal cabinet.
[time=2056] It's an opportunity right there for you and I not to pull into Wendy's.
[time=2061] It's an opportunity for you and I right there not to physically meet that need but to spiritually in that moment stop maybe literally right where you are if you can and just enjoy just a brief season of prayer, communication with him, conversation, adoration, confession, supplication.
[time=2082] Maybe it's in your car, maybe it's at your cubicle, maybe it's at home in front of the washing machine, I don't know but there is this opportunity with the hunger to fill that with a communication prayer draws your heart and mind and soul closer to him.
[time=2098] And he meets us at these places and he fills us, fasting, an opportunity to experience the emptiness, to be reminded of the emptiness that can only be filled by God.
[time=2110] We see prayer in God's Word, we see fasting in God's Word connected to sadness, we see it connected to prayer and all I love seeing this this week as I spend some time on this.
[time=2122] Go back to Isaiah, we see fasting connected to charity or compassion.
[time=2127] That's right, we see fasting connected to charity, a spirit, an attitude, a heart of compassion.
[time=2135] Go to Isaiah 58 verse 5, will you look at that with me?
[time=2141] Here we had people who were fasting for the wrong reasons and I'll explain that to you in just a moment but let me read this to you.
[time=2149] Isaiah 58 verse 5, is it a fast like this which I choose, the prophet writes, a day for a man to humble himself?
[time=2159] Is it for bowing one's head like a reed and for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed?
[time=2166] Will you call this a feat, will you call this a fast even an acceptable day to the Lord?
[time=2172] Is this not the fast which I choose to loosen the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke and to let the oppressed go free and break every yoke?
[time=2185] Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into the house when you see the naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
[time=2197] Then your light, when you come at it this way, when this is your heart, when this is your mindset, then your light, the prophet says, then your light will break out like the dawn and your recovery will speedily spring forth
[time=2210] and your righteousness will go before you.
[time=2213] The glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.
[time=2217] Then you will call and the Lord will answer.
[time=2220] You will cry and he will say, "Here I am." If you remove the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness and verse 10, if you give yourself to the hungry
[time=2232] and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then your light will rise in darkness and your gloom will become like midday.
[time=2244] Oftentimes we see fasting as an opportunity to remind us of the emptiness that only God can fill and fasting can be a season of time in which while we go without all that God has given us, it can be a season where you and I can share,
[time=2264] where you and I can go to great lengths to make sure that those who are in need around us are filled with only that which God can bring.
[time=2274] It's an amazing concept.
[time=2276] Fasting connected to sadness, fasting connected to prayer, fasting connected to charity.
[time=2283] Now, we're trying to be as practical as we can with you. We want to be extremely biblical and I don't think the two are necessarily opposed.
[time=2293] When you think of fasting, again, oftentimes we think of food.
[time=2297] I want you to understand that it's our opinion that there are opportunities in your life.
[time=2303] There are things that you eat, there is stuff that you drink, there are places that you go, there are activities that you give yourself to,
[time=2312] that in doing that, if you were to not do that, practically speaking, across the board, there are some things that you could not do and in not doing it,
[time=2323] or not eating it, or not drinking it, or not buying it, it could be for you a great reminder of the fullness that only he can bring.
[time=2335] Because sometimes my friends, you are eating and drinking and buying things, and sometimes we're going places and sometimes we're doing stuff because we feel what?
[time=2347] Empty.
[time=2348] We feel hungry.
[time=2350] And so in our humanness and in our flesh, we boom, we go and do stuff, we go and buy stuff.
[time=2356] Sometimes it's like, you know, it's just kind of like not that big of a deal, but it can get to be a big deal over time.
[time=2362] Sometimes it is right out of the gate, a huge deal.
[time=2366] So, again, I'm not trying to make light of this, but we prepared just a list.
[time=2371] It's not pleased.
[time=2372] It's not the list.
[time=2373] It's just a list of things that we wanted to show you to just give you some practical direction.
[time=2378] You may want to go with the food thing.
[time=2381] You may want to go 40 days.
[time=2383] If you do, you might want to talk to your doctor first.
[time=2387] You might want to go 20.
[time=2389] You may want to go 10.
[time=2390] You may want to go five seriously.
[time=2392] That's between you and him.
[time=2394] I've been just trying in the last six, eight weeks of my life.
[time=2398] I've been trying to, for the first time in a long time, revisit this discipline.
[time=2404] And I've been very, very grateful for, I've been trying to just go 24 hours on the food thing once a week.
[time=2412] And it's been a pretty special experience.
[time=2415] So the food thing is fine if that's how you want to go on.
[time=2418] So here are some other ideas that you, some of the things that you may want to fast from.
[time=2423] And I'll just show them to you here on the screen.
[time=2426] Here we go.
[time=2427] Hold on.
[time=2428] It does say Starbucks.
[time=2429] Sorry.
[time=2430] I just heard people gasp.
[time=2433] Starbucks, higher grounds.
[time=2435] Maybe we want to just say coffee.
[time=2438] Whether you're making it at home and drinking it, you know, in the kitchen.
[time=2441] Whether you're going out and spending $4.19 for a latte.
[time=2445] It's up to you.
[time=2446] The general idea is up there.
[time=2448] Starbucks, higher grounds.
[time=2449] Pop on the west coast.
[time=2451] We said Coke on the east coast.
[time=2453] They say soda.
[time=2454] But you can figure that out.
[time=2456] Chocolate.
[time=2457] Radio.
[time=2458] What would it be like to not turn your radio on for six weeks?
[time=2462] What would it be like for you to get in your car and go wherever you go and do whatever you do and not turn the radio on for six weeks?
[time=2470] And in those six weeks when you would normally turn on the radio, sit there and drive in quiet with your thoughts and your heart before him.
[time=2479] A chance to remember.
[time=2481] A chance to be prompted in your thinking toward him.
[time=2484] A chance to spend there a season of prayer with him.
[time=2488] Starbucks, higher grounds.
[time=2489] Pop.
[time=2490] Chocolate.
[time=2491] Radio.
[time=2492] iPods.
[time=2493] Sports television.
[time=2494] I don't know who put that up there.
[time=2495] Please delete that right now.
[time=2497] Sports television.
[time=2498] Food network.
[time=2499] Soaps.
[time=2500] I didn't actually think people watched soap operas anymore.
[time=2503] Somebody told me that people do actually still watch soaps.
[time=2507] So maybe that might be an idea for you.
[time=2509] Sports TV, Food Network soaps.
[time=2511] TV completely.
[time=2512] What if for six weeks you just didn't turn it on?
[time=2518] Like at all.
[time=2521] Just didn't turn it on.
[time=2523] What would that be like for you?
[time=2529] What would it be like to just not turn it on?
[time=2533] Imagine all the time we'd spend catching up on lost.
[time=2540] Imagine all the time we'd spend later.
[time=2542] Maybe catching up on this or that.
[time=2543] But what if for six weeks we just didn't have it?
[time=2547] What if in that time that you would spend watching it, what if we spent that time doing something else?
[time=2555] Individually as a couple with our kids?
[time=2563] Chocolate, radio, iPod, sports TV, TV completely.
[time=2566] Computer.
[time=2567] Some of you need the computer.
[time=2568] Some of you have to access your computer on an hourly basis, on a moment by moment basis.
[time=2574] I understand that.
[time=2575] Some of that's for work.
[time=2576] Some of that's for you to keep your job great.
[time=2578] But what if, aside from that, you know, what if the hours and hours that this culture spends just clicking and clicking and clicking just surfing, just looking, just asking for trouble?
[time=2594] What if we just said no?
[time=2596] What if you put the mouse away for six weeks?
[time=2600] And every single moment you used to spend doing that, you spent doing something else?
[time=2607] What if you took that time to read your scriptures for that week?
[time=2611] Just a thought.
[time=2614] Computer, web surfing, dessert, snacks, meat, sugar, just sugar all together.
[time=2620] What if you didn't have a, what if you didn't have a grain of sugar for six weeks?
[time=2626] Look at y'all squirming in your seats.
[time=2629] Eating out video games, video games, video games, computer games.
[time=2636] I thought for the longest time that was just for kids.
[time=2639] It's amazing how you get older, right?
[time=2642] And culture continues to, you know, like progress or maybe regress.
[time=2646] I was actually, honestly, I think video games, I think kids.
[time=2649] I was actually with a young married couple mid to late 20s, not too long ago, trying to help them work through some major crisis in their life.
[time=2658] And guess what the major crisis was for this 27, 28 year old man?
[time=2664] Video games.
[time=2667] And I'm not like saying they're evil.
[time=2670] I'm saying they're evil if they take the place of your wife.
[time=2674] But you know, we just think about it.
[time=2676] Think about the time you spend doing any of these things.
[time=2678] And think about what you could do with that time.
[time=2681] Maybe if you gave yourself to a six week span, video games, movies.
[time=2686] I love this next one.
[time=2687] Unnecessary shopping.
[time=2689] There is necessary shopping, right?
[time=2692] Feed your family.
[time=2693] There is necessary shopping.
[time=2695] Put clothes on them.
[time=2697] There is necessary spending, you know, pay your mortgage.
[time=2700] But then there's the shopping that you do.
[time=2702] And there's the shopping that even I do at times where you just, you're just not feeling it.
[time=2707] You're just feeling down.
[time=2708] You're just having a tough afternoon.
[time=2710] It's just been a hard week.
[time=2711] There's just times where with our emotions at a certain level, we go and try and find relief for the purchase.
[time=2719] And it's not necessary.
[time=2721] It's really, at the end of the day, unnecessary shopping.
[time=2724] What if you just made a commitment before God and probably a few friends to say, "You know what?
[time=2729] I'm just going to buy for six weeks what I need to buy.
[time=2732] And I'm not going to spend money on anything or anyone other
[time=2738] than those basic fundamental needs." Just a thought.
[time=2742] Cell phone.
[time=2743] Texting.
[time=2744] Here's a thought.
[time=2746] Gang up there on top.
[time=2748] You, you, you, you, kings of texting.
[time=2753] And I'm saying that with a great heart.
[time=2755] You, you, experts at texting and others of us are catching up.
[time=2759] But I mean, what if, whether it was students or whether it was you or me, what if, what if we made a commitment for six weeks that I'm just going to talk to them instead of text them?
[time=2769] And what if every time I was tempted to text, I said, "No, I'll call later." And then I spent that 45 seconds in prayer.
[time=2779] God, thank you for this preparation time.
[time=2781] Thank you for what we're doing at church.
[time=2783] Thanks for the sacrifice of your son.
[time=2786] Cell phones.
[time=2787] What did some of you have to have them?
[time=2790] Others of you could turn them off and put them in a drawer for six weeks and you wouldn't die.
[time=2796] Just giving you some ideas.
[time=2797] Some things that we can go without in an effort to remember that he, God, is the only one who can fill us.
[time=2805] Electricity.
[time=2806] That was just a great idea.
[time=2808] We were in a meeting last week and somebody said they knew of a family who, in the modern day, like would just periodically, for the sake of perspective, flip the circuit breaker and go without.
[time=2819] They'd take their kids, they'd get together, go for a couple hours with no electricity, light a few candles, tell some stories, read God's Word, and sit there in all their affluence
[time=2832] in the dark.
[time=2835] And just remember how grateful they should be for the fact that they're going to turn those breakers back on in a couple hours and everything's going to go back to normal.
[time=2845] Prayer and fasting.
[time=2847] That's just, again, on the food thing.
[time=2849] You may want to go that way.
[time=2850] And then there's that last one that I've got up there.
[time=2853] Something destructive.
[time=2854] And I want to say this.
[time=2855] We can laugh about Starbucks and TVs being off and turning off circuit breakers.
[time=2863] You know what, my friends?
[time=2865] This may be for you and God, maybe God was just in this.
[time=2870] And it may be for you, some of you in the room this morning, are engaged in maybe something very secret.
[time=2879] Maybe it's just very private.
[time=2880] Maybe nobody in the world knows about it, except you and God.
[time=2886] And maybe there's something going on with you that is extremely destructive, maybe it's very addictive.
[time=2893] Maybe it's immoral.
[time=2895] Maybe it's dishonest.
[time=2898] Maybe you're involved with someone you shouldn't be.
[time=2900] Maybe you're stealing things that aren't yours.
[time=2902] Maybe you're just going down a road.
[time=2906] That you know down deep in your heart, like I know down deep in mind, it's just absolutely going to kill you.
[time=2913] It's going to ruin you.
[time=2915] That may be, while we're working on lattes and chocolate, maybe for you, this is a chance that God's giving you to put a very big stake in the ground, draw a very big line in the sand and say, "You know what?
[time=2931] Enough.
[time=2933] I'm going to stop.
[time=2935] I'm going to go talk to a couple people who I can trust.
[time=2938] I'm going to tell them what's going on and I'm going to stop.
[time=2943] These six weeks for you will lead you to a time on Good Friday and that Sunday morning where you could then celebrate like you haven't celebrated in years."
[time=2959] Give it some thought.
[time=2961] Fasting.
[time=2962] Jesus did it in Matthew 4, Moses on Mount Sinai, Elijah in 1 Kings 19, all of those instances, 40 days and 40 nights.
[time=2970] There's a chance to do whatever God leads you to do here on this thing for about six weeks.
[time=2975] Lastly, almsgiving.
[time=2977] Almsgiving.
[time=2978] Alms, a gift for the poor.
[time=2980] I looked it up.
[time=2981] Alms, any material favor offered to assist the needy.
[time=2987] And here's how we're going to do this.
[time=2990] We don't want to eat into your tithe.
[time=2994] There's a lot going on around here, but you know what?
[time=2996] I want to eat into your affluence.
[time=3000] And I've told you this before, the change in your ashtray right now could feed a kid in the Sudan for a year, for a week, excuse me.
[time=3010] If you've got change on the top of your dresser at home, you're wealthy.
[time=3015] Now what we're going to do is this.
[time=3017] Every week, actually beginning today, and I know we didn't tell you this, so I understand.
[time=3022] We're just going to start today.
[time=3024] Change, your change, your small bills, your quarters, your dimes, your nickels.
[time=3032] Here you go, your change.
[time=3034] When the bill at Wendy's is 627, and you give them a 10, for the next six weeks, your change.
[time=3043] Would you be willing to keep your change?
[time=3045] Would you be willing to help your kids keep their change?
[time=3048] Would you be willing to tell somebody about this so that they might be willing to keep their change?
[time=3053] And we're going to take all of our change, all of our leftovers stuff that gets tossed here and tossed there and stuck in cans, and we're going to invite you to bring it every week.
[time=3064] Now watch this.
[time=3065] I kicked myself.
[time=3066] I forgot to tell first hour of this, so we'll just, we'll send out an email or something.
[time=3070] Watch this.
[time=3071] What if, here's just a way to think this through.
[time=3073] What if every, you know the list of things you could fast?
[time=3077] So many of us in the room may end up picking something to fast, that when we don't do that, we don't spend what?
[time=3086] And what if you took the $2 or the $3 or the $4 that you spend every single day on the coffee?
[time=3093] And not only did you fast the coffee, but you saved the three bucks.
[time=3098] Every single time, put the three bucks aside.
[time=3101] What if we just took the fasting and the almsgiving and brought an offering of change,
[time=3107] a symbol of our fluence, and at the end of every week we're going to give it in the back, and at the end of all of it, we're going to take everything you give, all your change, and I'm going in April with a team from Blackhawk back to Nairobi to Kenya to visit those dear people at the orphanage and be with those little babies that are struggling to survive.
[time=3127] And Dave Walters is going back to Nairobi in June and will Dave and I'll take what we give as a family over the next six weeks and we'll give it to the orphanage to help those kids.
[time=3136] Amen?
[time=3137] So you give it some thought.
[time=3139] Corbin, come on up if you would.
[time=3141] And I'm going to just close with this.
[time=3143] Every week there'll be some symbols.
[time=3145] Every week we will have a new symbol.
[time=3147] This morning Corbin is going to kind of just talk you through the first symbol.
[time=3151] But I had him put the symbols up on the screen.
[time=3154] Those are the things that we'll use each week visually here in our service, all in an effort to think about my friends.
[time=3161] Be reminded of Christ's sacrifice and his victory over death.
[time=3167] I hope that you're willing.
[time=3169] I really do.
[time=3170] What do you say?
[time=3171] Let's give this a shot.
[time=3173] You and me together as individuals, as families, as a family.
[time=3177] Let's give some thought to what God could do in our hearts and how we could make much of him as we think about and prepare ourselves for that great, great weekend in March.
[time=3187] I hope you'll consider it.
[time=3189] Listen, as Corbin talks you through this first symbol and I'll come back up and close us in just a moment.
[time=3195] These symbols will just be visual reminders of what we'll be focusing on in our Scripture reading each week.
[time=3201] So this morning's symbol reminds us of Christ's service on the earth and it's a picture in basin.
[time=3207] While the picture in basin is brought up to the front, I'm going to read from John 13 verses 1-17.
[time=3213] In honor of God's word, would you stand please as I read?
[time=3220] John 13.
[time=3222] It was just before the Passover feast.
[time=3225] Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father.
[time=3230] Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.
[time=3237] The evening meal was being served and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.
[time=3246] Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God.
[time=3254] So he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing and wrapped a towel around his waist.
[time=3262] After that he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
[time=3271] He came to Simon Peter who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
[time=3277] Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I'm doing, but later you will understand."
[time=3283] "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me." Then Lord Simon Peter replied, "Not just my feet, but my hands and my head as well."
[time=3298] Jesus answered a person who has had a bath and he's only to wash his feet.
[time=3302] His whole body is clean and you are clean, though not every one of you, for he knew who was going to betray him and that is why he said not every one of you is clean.
[time=3312] When he was finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place.
[time=3317] "Do you understand what I've done for you?" He asked them, "You call me teacher and Lord, and rightly so for that is what I am."
[time=3325] "Now that I, your Lord, and teacher have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet."
[time=3332] I've set an example for you that you should do as I have done for you.
[time=3336] I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is his messenger greater than the one who sent him.
[time=3343] Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
[time=3348] Well, so there you have it, the preparation as we're calling it.
[time=3353] This amazing privilege that we get over the next six weeks to really, in a very intensive and very intentional way,
[time=3361] prepare ourselves, our hearts and our minds and our bodies and our souls for the remembering of what Christ did,
[time=3369] the sacrifice of Christ on Good Friday and the amazing joy and celebration of his resurrection on Easter.
[time=3377] Over these six weeks, I want you to know that you can participate with us in all that you just heard.
[time=3382] I want you to participate with us in six weeks of Scripture reading.
[time=3387] I'd love it if you, as a Bible our viewer, would think of something that you want to fast over these next six weeks.
[time=3397] We'd love for you if you felt led to participate in our change offering, this offering that's going to go
[time=3405] toward those in need in Nairobi, in Kenya, at the orphanage.
[time=3410] There's a way that you can participate with us. Just go to our website, go to blackhockministries.org.
[time=3416] And there's a few things there I want you to know. You can get the Scripture readings.
[time=3419] We passed out during the service, the little cards that have the Scripture readings for the whole six weeks.
[time=3424] You can get that whole Scripture reading program for the whole six weeks on our website when you click on the preparation.
[time=3431] I also want to encourage you to pick something to fast and then tell us about it.
[time=3436] As you read God's Word, as you fast and experience a profound sense of God's presence in your life,
[time=3443] you can click on the website under the preparation, a chat room.
[time=3448] There's a discussion board where you can kind of go back and forth with those of us here at Blackhock who are engaged in this same preparation.
[time=3456] We would love for this to be something that you would experience with us.
[time=3461] As I've told you for years, you're part of our family.
[time=3464] And we want this six week period of time to be something very, very special for you as well.
[time=3469] So join us in the preparation. Go to the website and jump in here with us and let's together prepare our hearts for what is to come.
[time=3477] And we'll just thank God for what He'll do in you and us as we look forward to this time.
[time=3483] God bless you. Hope to see you soon.
