[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=8] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=15] [MUSIC]
[time=20] Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=28] [MUSIC]
[time=36] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=43] [MUSIC]
[time=47] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=50] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=73] We can wound it, send her, lost and left to die.
[time=80] And raise your hair for love is passing by.
[time=86] Come to Jesus, come to Jesus, come to Jesus, and live.
[time=100] And now your burdens lift and carry far away.
[time=107] And precious blood has washed away the same.
[time=113] So sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus, and live.
[time=127] I can do more, baby, don't be afraid to crawl.
[time=133] And remember when one, sometimes we walk.
[time=138] Fall of Jesus, fall of Jesus, fall of Jesus.
[time=148] And more, Jesus, fall of Jesus.
[time=154] Sometimes the waves don't linger, they're steep and filled with pain.
[time=160] So if your sky is dark and cold, stay, then cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus.
[time=177] And more, Jesus, fall of Jesus, cry to Jesus, sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus.
[time=200] If you find a heartbeat, kiss the world goodbye, and go in peace, and laugh on the side.
[time=221] And fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus.
[time=249] Good morning.
[time=265] My name is Corbin Miller.
[time=266] I'm the worship pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and Kelly Bird asked me today to introduce to you an event coming up and a friend of ours who's a part of it.
[time=274] The event is called Bringing Home the Prodigals, and it's happening here in Fort Wayne next month.
[time=280] And our friend today is Andrew Booth from Heartland Community Church.
[time=282] Good morning, Andy.
[time=283] Hi, Corbin.
[time=284] It's good to be with you.
[time=285] Thank you.
[time=286] Hey, tell us just a little bit about yourself and what you do.
[time=289] I can't gather from your accent that you're not really from around Fort Wayne.
[time=294] Right.
[time=295] Yeah, you would be right.
[time=296] I was born and raised in the UK, I'm in a place called Wales on the west part of the UK.
[time=301] But for the last nine years, I've lived in Fort Wayne.
[time=302] I graduated from Taylor University in Fort Wayne, and I work as the team leader at the Heartland Church.
[time=308] Great.
[time=309] So, Fort Wayne is home to you now.
[time=310] Yeah, it is.
[time=311] So, what does Wales, growing up there in living now in Fort Wayne, have to do with this event next month, Bringing Home the Prodigals?
[time=318] Well, Corbin, Bringing Home the Prodigals is an event that focus on the family is doing an association with Taylor and WBCL.
[time=325] And it's an event that began in the UK, and my dad is the CEO of Focus on the Family in the UK.
[time=331] It's actually called Care for the Family.
[time=333] And several years ago, they started doing this event called Bringing Home the Prodigals, and literally, over the last seven, eight years, it's touched thousands and thousands of people in nation after nation after nation.
[time=343] And Focus on the Family was looking for a place to pilot it in the US and they chose Fort Wayne because of the personal connection.
[time=350] Great.
[time=351] So, this morning, I want to introduce you to Rob Parsons, who's the main communicator at Bringing Home the Prodigals, as he shares the history behind this event and his heart.
[time=359] So, let's watch this together.
[time=363] Bringing Home the Prodigals began for me in the National Exhibition Centre in England
[time=373] about eight years ago.
[time=375] I was asked to preach a message on Prodigals, and I shared with 4,000 people what God had laid on my heart for the Prodigals of our nation.
[time=383] I had no idea as that message came to an end what was about to be unleashed.
[time=388] Somebody asked me to preach the message again and again, and then the event bringing Home the Prodigals was born.
[time=394] In my mind's eye now, I see tens of thousands of people all across the nation bringing the names of their Prodigals and laying them at the foot of the cross.
[time=402] Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, but mostly children.
[time=408] And now all across the world this event is beginning to take place.
[time=412] You know, we all have Prodigals on our hearts.
[time=415] And one of the things that God laid on my heart was we have to lay down the guilt that many of us feel over our Prodigals, especially parents.
[time=424] Parents say to me, if only I'd been a better mother, if only I'd been a better father.
[time=428] But you know, we have to lay down that guilt.
[time=430] God has trouble with His children too.
[time=433] And then it has to do not just with bringing our Prodigals home, but the kind of local churches they come back to when the Father's house is filled with the Father's love, the
[time=443] Prodigals will come home.
[time=446] And then when they do come home, pray with all your heart, they meet the Father before they meet the Elder Brother.
[time=452] The Elder Brother will have a long list of rules and regulations.
[time=455] Are you still doing that?
[time=457] But the Father will be patient.
[time=459] The Father will know they will still be smelling of the pig's dye.
[time=462] The Father will wrap His arms around them and welcome them home.
[time=466] The Father will have time for the Prodigals.
[time=470] But above all, this simple message, which has now touched the lives of millions across the world, has that it's hard, that each of us are totally thrown on God for our Prodigals.
[time=482] And part of this evening will be crying out to the Creator of the universe and saying, "Father, wherever they are, touch my Prodigal and from the four corners of the earth, bring
[time=493] them home." I hope with all my heart you can share this evening with us.
[time=498] And cry out to God for the Prodigals of your nation, your home, the Prodigal God has laid.
[time=505] On your heart.
[time=507] The events taking place in the brand new beautiful auditorium in the new music building at IPFW.
[time=513] And it's taking place on March the 8th at seven o'clock.
[time=516] You can find out more information or you can book online by going to www.prodigals.org.uk.
[time=522] And let me encourage you to be part of this evening of hope and worship as we pray for
[time=528] Prodigals everywhere.
[time=529] Thanks so much, Andy, for that information.
[time=531] Thanks for being here and telling us about this event next month we're looking forward to it.
[time=536] And we just want to encourage all of you to go to that website and learn some more information about bringing home the Prodigals.
[time=542] We are glad we have a father to his wife, we are glad we have a father to his wife, we
[time=759] [APPLAUSE - 30 seconds]
[time=807] I never knew you could run in a tux or address that fast.
[time=811] That is amazing.
[time=813] I'll tell you what, I don't need to stand here and tell you the amount of hours.
[time=818] You know, and work and dedication and discipline that those young people have given themselves to
[time=826] in an effort to honor God and raise their voices and we get the privilege of that this morning.
[time=832] [APPLAUSE]
[time=836] That's good.
[time=838] Boy, this morning, you know, just all that we've been able to experience so far, not the least of which is this powerful reminder that we get the privilege of participating in,
[time=851] you know, around here on a monthly basis formally, the table here of our Lord,
[time=857] the symbols of His bruised and striped body, His spilled blood.
[time=864] What a morning for us to not only be able to remember this, but to now come to a passage in our study of 1 John
[time=871] that deals with in a very, very powerful way, in a very, very straightforward way,
[time=878] the very thing that this sacrifice freed us from.
[time=883] Most of you in the room know that the sacrifice of Christ freed us from the power
[time=889] and the dominion and the bondage of what sin.
[time=895] And what He did here, you know, with His sacrifice, what He accomplished, Calvary, you and I know that that was enormous.
[time=902] You and I know that that was eternal.
[time=904] You and I know that there's nothing that could have accomplished all that He accomplished there.
[time=910] It was far and above and beyond the greatest sacrifice ever made and its impact in your life and mind, unspeakable.
[time=921] And yet in the way this all plays out, while what He did there was sufficient,
[time=927] and while what He did there was powerful and eternal until we get to that place of eternity,
[time=936] until we get to that place where we're able to be with Him someday, until we come to that point in time where we are completely and absolutely and finally transformed ultimately, you and I are left in our humanness
[time=953] and in this human state to struggle with what sin.
[time=958] And what a struggle it is.
[time=963] How many of you in the room would in all honesty raise your hand today and say that you like me at times grow so very weary of the struggle and the battle we have with sin?
[time=978] Yeah, and I imagine every hand would go right back up, or I should say this, I hope every hand would go right back up.
[time=983] If I were to say to you, would you be interested this morning?
[time=988] Would it speak to you?
[time=990] Would your soul be encouraged this morning?
[time=994] If we were able to come together and find in the very words of Scripture some powerful biblical reminders, some powerful scriptural encouragement
[time=1004] that might lift us up, that might point us in a good and godly direction
[time=1010] as we face this battle, this fight with sin.
[time=1014] I mean, who in the room would be open this morning to some powerful reminders that could affect the way you and I live and think as we come face to face with the temptation of sin.
[time=1025] Anybody up for an encouragement on that front?
[time=1027] Let me see your hand.
[time=1028] Oh, good.
[time=1030] I'm thankful.
[time=1032] Well, I want to read you this morning.
[time=1034] A very forthright.
[time=1036] Some might consider blunt and in your face passage.
[time=1040] At the same time though, John, here in the book of 1 John, as the Apostle John writes, he brings to this very forthright, very blunt passage,
[time=1050] again, the great love of a pastor who cared deeply for these people.
[time=1055] And while his words are straightforward, you sense his heart.
[time=1059] And I want to read it to you this morning.
[time=1062] It says in 1 John 3, would you stand in honor of God's Word?
[time=1067] 1 John 3 verses 4 through 10.
[time=1073] It says everyone who practices sin, and I want you just to kind of make a mental note on how many times you see this word "practice" or this phrase "practicing sin" or "practicing righteousness."
[time=1088] Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness.
[time=1093] And sin is lawlessness.
[time=1097] You know that he appeared in order to take away sins.
[time=1101] And in him there is no sin.
[time=1103] No one who abides in him sins.
[time=1114] No one who sins has seen him or knows him.
[time=1119] Little children.
[time=1122] You hear his heart there?
[time=1124] He doesn't say you utter failures.
[time=1128] He doesn't say you despicable people.
[time=1133] He says little children, those whom I love, make sure no one deceives you.
[time=1138] Because the Gnostics back several weeks to the beginning of this study, the Gnostics had been attempting to deceive them on this issue of sin.
[time=1146] We'll come to that in a moment here.
[time=1148] He says make sure that no one deceives you.
[time=1151] The one who practices righteousness is righteous just as he is righteous.
[time=1157] The one verse 8.
[time=1158] The one who practices sin is of the devil.
[time=1162] For the devil has sinned from the beginning.
[time=1165] The Son of God appeared for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil.
[time=1170] No one who is born of God practices sin.
[time=1175] Because his seed, God's seed abides in him.
[time=1178] And he cannot sin because he is born of God.
[time=1181] By this verse 10, the children of God and the children of the devil.
[time=1188] Well that just kind of lays it out there, doesn't it?
[time=1193] You're either a child of God or you're a child of the devil.
[time=1199] But by this, the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious.
[time=1207] Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.
[time=1216] Let's pray.
[time=1220] Father God, we would confess as we read that passage this morning.
[time=1225] Some of us God have been reading this passage for years.
[time=1230] And while we may understand its truth and while this morning we may have the privilege again to understand and see its truth and meaning.
[time=1237] God we would just confess that there lies in these words, God the sense that we desperately need your help.
[time=1244] And that we would definitely and desperately as those who have claimed to come to know you,
[time=1252] as those who would profess a relationship with you, God we must give attention to this relationship that we have with sin.
[time=1261] God we must be clear on how it is that you've called us to live.
[time=1266] And God we want to be a people that would represent you.
[time=1270] We want to be a people that could be ambassadors for you.
[time=1274] God we want to carry your name.
[time=1276] God we want to live God honoring lives.
[time=1279] God we want to please you in every respect.
[time=1282] We know that your word here has some things to say about the way we would do that.
[time=1287] The way we would practice our lives.
[time=1290] And God we want that practice to be bent toward you.
[time=1293] We want that practice to represent you.
[time=1296] And so God give us great encouragement this morning.
[time=1300] Remind us.
[time=1301] Give us new learning.
[time=1302] Help us to see how it is that we are to posture ourselves with you as we posture ourselves against sin.
[time=1310] In your son's name we pray.
[time=1312] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1320] Well you know the first time I heard this passage taught was 24 years ago.
[time=1328] That's right, 24 years ago was the very first time I ever heard this passage taught.
[time=1336] I had just recently come to faith in Christ and was at a point in my relationship with him.
[time=1342] It was very new.
[time=1343] I was soaking up God's word like a sponge in a puddle.
[time=1349] If you want to just kind of get that picture in your mind and that's exactly what it was like.
[time=1353] 24 years ago it was the first time I ever heard this passage taught.
[time=1357] I was soaking up God's word like a sponge in a puddle.
[time=1360] I was also in those early days of walking with him.
[time=1364] There was an amazing thing that was beginning to transpire.
[time=1367] I was beginning to experience an enormous shift in my relationship with sin.
[time=1375] You see sin and I had in the days leading up to my conversion sin and I had become very close.
[time=1384] You could say intimate.
[time=1389] I was in those days controlled by sin.
[time=1394] I had an appetite for sin.
[time=1399] I used to spend time thinking about how to sin and even dispensed myself that I enjoyed it.
[time=1408] And now only a few months into this growing fully surrendered relationship with Christ,
[time=1415] I was sensing a radically different view and feeling about sin.
[time=1420] It was amazing.
[time=1421] I was grateful for it and I sensed it all through me.
[time=1426] It wasn't just sitting in that room that day it was in the day to day of life.
[time=1430] Now as I was trying my best with God's help to follow his son all of a sudden, it wasn't as attractive as it used to be.
[time=1438] Its emptiness and destructive nature was becoming more and more visible to me, whereas before sin seemed thrilling.
[time=1450] Raise your hand if sin ever felt thrilling to you.
[time=1455] Now the thought of it, what was offered, the temptation and all that came with it.
[time=1463] Whereas before sin had seemed thrilling, now it was beginning to feel offensive and convicting.
[time=1471] I was four to six months or so into this new journey that I sat in a pew much like the one you're
[time=1479] sitting in this morning and heard someone explain, heard someone teach for me from the Scriptures
[time=1486] here in 1 John why my relationship with sin had changed.
[time=1491] I knew it was changing.
[time=1492] I knew that all of a sudden I viewed it differently.
[time=1495] I knew that all of a sudden the appetite wasn't the same.
[time=1498] I knew that there was something going on in me that was really altering my desire for sin.
[time=1504] And I kind of knew big picture at that point being so immature and young.
[time=1508] I knew it was God, but I didn't know what was really going on there.
[time=1513] And I'll never forget I sat there that day and heard this individual teach through this passage
[time=1520] and helped me.
[time=1521] It helped me understand why I now wanted to stay away from it instead of living in it like I had before.
[time=1532] I heard this pastor/teacher take me through 1 John 3, 4 to 10 and realize that day why
[time=1539] the genuinely saved individual now has a very different relationship with sin, a very different
[time=1547] view of sin.
[time=1548] And I want to do my best today to share with each of you here in this room wherever you may be on your journey that very same message.
[time=1556] And I mean that, it's the very same message. I heard it that day 24 years ago.
[time=1562] I probably have heard it 20, 30, 40 times since.
[time=1567] I got the cassette tape the next day after I heard it.
[time=1572] I've probably listened to that cassette.
[time=1574] I don't know how many times I've preached this message before.
[time=1578] I've heard it preached by that same individual again and again and again.
[time=1582] I've got his study Bible right here in front of me that he wrote or that he, you know, bring his notes to.
[time=1589] The message is outlined right here in his study Bible.
[time=1592] I could just, I could close this and I could turn all this over.
[time=1596] I could probably just tell you a word for a word.
[time=1598] What's in the message?
[time=1599] It is a message that has stayed with me for years.
[time=1602] And I believe it's a powerful, powerful opportunity for you and I to give thought to our relationship
[time=1610] today with sin.
[time=1613] There's two things I want to just remind you of before we jump into this passage.
[time=1618] I think it's important for you to understand as we get into the verbiage and as we get into the, to the looking at the verses.
[time=1626] Number one, I want to remind you about the Gnostics, the heresy that had crept into the church.
[time=1632] I want to remind you about the Gnostic view of sin.
[time=1635] You know how we've been having in this study different tests of genuine salvation?
[time=1640] Well, here we come to another test.
[time=1641] There is a way that a genuinely redeemed person will relate to.
[time=1646] There is a, there is a mindset.
[time=1648] There is a heart that a genuinely redeemed person will have as it relates to sin.
[time=1655] The way you view it, the way you respond to it, the way you function and choose in the
[time=1662] midst of its temptation.
[time=1664] There is a way that the genuinely redeemed will respond.
[time=1668] Sin is a big deal.
[time=1671] And the Gnostics had come into the church and the Gnostics had kind of come into culture.
[time=1676] And they had said the opposite and John was aware of this and so he speaks into it.
[time=1681] The Gnostics had said, you know what?
[time=1683] Sin, especially the sin of the body, especially sins of morality or immorality.
[time=1690] The Gnostics had said that the body is so bad, the spirit is so good.
[time=1695] The body is so bad, they said it doesn't matter.
[time=1698] It is inconsequential what you do with your body.
[time=1703] Sins of the body, they said inconsequential, don't worry about it.
[time=1709] And so John has to address this issue of sin and the fact that it is anything but inconsequential.
[time=1717] It carries with an enormous consequence.
[time=1723] And you need to understand that as a backdrop as you hear him now speaking to the writing to these people about sin.
[time=1731] You think he sounds pointed, you think he sounds intense, you know what?
[time=1735] He was because it was a serious dire situation that God now through John speaks into.
[time=1743] They needed to know the truth about sin and the relationship the believer now should have
[time=1751] with it or maybe better said the lack of relationship.
[time=1755] Now second thing I want you to see before we jump in here and I asked you before we read
[time=1761] the passage to just kind of take a mental note on this phrase practicing sin, practicing
[time=1769] righteousness.
[time=1770] Friends we've mentioned this briefly in the past so important that you understand this morning what is meant by the one who knows God does not sin.
[time=1782] Here we're talking about the practice of sin and I want to just read to you right here from the notes of my own Bible.
[time=1786] It says the verb to practice sin, the verb practice in the Greek conveys the idea of making
[time=1792] sin listen, of making sin a habitual practice, habitual ongoing, unchecked, unchanging, progressively
[time=1804] practice of sin.
[time=1807] The verb speaks to the habitual practice although genuine Christians have a sin disposition.
[time=1814] You understand that phrase?
[time=1816] As a believer even though we have been redeemed even though second Corinthians 5 said all things have been made new, even though we have been completely forgiven, even though we have been
[time=1827] thoroughly redeemed, even though we're in the process of being sanctified there is still in us.
[time=1833] This side of heaven there is in us and there will be in us this disposition, this fleshly
[time=1840] bent toward the fleshly, this fleshly inclination toward sin.
[time=1848] That struggle, that battle is not going to go away.
[time=1851] We have been empowered because we've been saved and redeemed to fight it, to move through
[time=1857] it.
[time=1858] But we have this sin disposition, I'm reminded of what it says in 1-8.
[time=1862] If you just go to 1 John 1-8 there, he says in 1-8, he says if we say we have no sin,
[time=1868] the word their sin is the general category of, if we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves.
[time=1874] None of us has this bent toward sinfulness.
[time=1881] Back to practicing sin, although genuine Christians have a sin disposition and do commit sin and
[time=1887] need to confess it, 1 John 1-9, we talked about that before, you confess your sin, I
[time=1893] mean John assumes John realizes we're going to commit it and he knows that we have the
[time=1899] disposition and we have the need to confess it, but it is not the unbroken pattern of their
[time=1906] lives.
[time=1907] Do you hear that?
[time=1910] Although genuine Christians have this disposition, what John is saying here throughout this book is that it is not the unbroken pattern of their lives.
[time=1919] A genuinely born-again believer has a built-in check or guard against habitual sinning due
[time=1929] to the new nature.
[time=1933] Romans 6 talks about that and we'll go there in just a moment.
[time=1937] So I understand as you read through 1 John, I understand especially as you look through our passage here this morning that there's a sense where you read it and go wow, that's me, I practice it.
[time=1947] I mean if you're going to define practice, Kelly has like, you know, like doing it, yeah, I do it, I sin, I guess I don't know God.
[time=1955] And I want you to understand even the grammatical construction here and the heart of John isn't
[time=1962] one that's now elevating a spiritual bar of perfection.
[time=1967] We're talking about ongoing habitual unbroken patterns of willful deception and deceit and
[time=1976] sin and transgression.
[time=1979] So here's some great encouragement for you and I want you to see it as such.
[time=1982] Here are four things I want you to see.
[time=1985] Why can't a Christian practice sin?
[time=1988] You could say it that way.
[time=1990] Why can't a Christian practice sin?
[time=1993] You could also see these four things as huge, huge encouragements, spiritual realities that
[time=1999] you and I can be reminded of today and apply in our lives as we continue in this battle
[time=2005] with sin.
[time=2006] Say it however you'd like, here's four things from this message I heard 24 years ago.
[time=2011] Number one, we can't practice sin because practicing sin is incompatible with the law
[time=2017] of God.
[time=2019] Because practicing sin is incompatible with the law of God, the law of God which those
[time=2026] who know Him, what, love.
[time=2031] The law of God.
[time=2032] Everybody says they're in verse four, everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness
[time=2038] and sin is, what, lawlessness.
[time=2042] Sin strikes at the very heart of this, practicing sin is absolutely in thorough and complete
[time=2049] contradiction to the very law of God which you and I have completely given ourselves to,
[time=2056] devoted ourselves to.
[time=2059] And I want to just remind you this morning from the very chapter in the book of Psalms, we've talked about this chapter in the past, what a powerful, powerful chapter it is from Psalm 119 where the author, where David goes through verse after verse after verse after
[time=2074] verse extolling and lifting up not only his love for the truth but the great impact that
[time=2081] the truth has in your life and mine.
[time=2086] This is at the heart, this is at the foundation of what those who know Him really feel and
[time=2092] really sense and really give themselves to.
[time=2095] Psalm 119, 34, we're just going to kind of fly through these, listen and be encouraged this morning.
[time=2100] The psalmist says, "Give me understanding that I may observe your law and keep it with all my what?
[time=2107] My heart." He goes on in verse 35 to say, "Make me walk in the path of your commandments.
[time=2114] Make me," he says.
[time=2115] "Make me walk in the path of your truth for I," what, "delight in it."
[time=2122] When we delight in it, when we love it, God does great things.
[time=2126] "Behold, I long for your precepts, revive me through your righteousness."
[time=2132] He goes on in verse 48 to say, "And I shall lift up my hands to your commandments," which
[time=2139] I what?
[time=2140] Say it, love.
[time=2142] And I will meditate on your statutes.
[time=2145] He goes on from 48, look at 77, "May your compassion come to me that I may live, for
[time=2151] your law is my what?" Delight.
[time=2156] Later in verse 97, "Oh, how I love your law.
[time=2162] It is my meditation all the day." The genuinely redeemed have this perspective, the genuinely saved are those who aren't perfect.
[time=2177] But there is in them this absolute utter love and delight in God's truth and they meditate
[time=2184] on it.
[time=2185] I'm so thankful that we gave you these cards last week.
[time=2190] So many of you have been participating with us in the preparation and on a daily basis
[time=2196] now, hiding God's Word in your heart, inundating yourself with the great life-changing truth
[time=2203] of God's Word.
[time=2204] In fact, we've got extra cards, some of you didn't get some last week.
[time=2207] If you didn't get a card, they'll be available for you on your way out today.
[time=2211] Make sure you pick one of these up.
[time=2213] But the genuinely redeemed, I've said it to you before, my friends, the genuinely redeemed.
[time=2218] They love God's Word, they read God's Word, they memorize God's Word, they meditate
[time=2224] on it, they listen to it in song, they have it in their room, they have it in their office,
[time=2230] they have it in their car, they stop at nothing.
[time=2233] They have it on cards.
[time=2234] I mean, they realize that in their relationship to sin, that foundationally one of the great
[time=2240] strengths and opportunities God gives them is to surround themselves, heart, mind, body, soul with the truth.
[time=2247] And when they delight in this, and when they love this, it brings great strength, it brings
[time=2254] great purpose.
[time=2255] I love what it says in Romans 7, write this down in Romans 7, 22, it's a great phrase,
[time=2261] it's just even a better picture that comes with it.
[time=2264] Paul, in this chapter in Romans 7, he's talking about this very thing.
[time=2268] In Romans 7, Paul's talking about this utter battle with sin.
[time=2274] He's describing in Romans 7 how what he wants to do, he doesn't do, and what he doesn't
[time=2280] want to do, he does.
[time=2282] And there's this battle with sin, but when it gets right down to it at the core of who he is, he says, "For I joyfully concur," it's a great phrase, "I joyfully concur with
[time=2295] the law of God in the inner man." The phrase "joyfully concur," here's the picture that comes with it.
[time=2301] Those words put together give the picture of a classroom, if you will.
[time=2307] This is joyfully concurring.
[time=2308] Just picture with me.
[time=2309] There's some teachers in the room.
[time=2310] In fact, this won't be hard for you.
[time=2312] Picture a room full of 30-second graders.
[time=2317] And just picture the teacher standing in front of the class.
[time=2320] And picture the teacher saying, "Okay, kids, here's the question.
[time=2323] You got an old lady on a street corner trying to make her way across the street.
[time=2328] And I want you to tell me what's the right answer." It's the right answer that you should go in tripper or is the right answer that you should go and take her by the hand and move her across the street gently.
[time=2340] Class, if the right answer is to go over and help her across the street, raise your hand.
[time=2346] And it's not just the raising of the hand, but you can in your mind right now picture how they would raise them, can't you?
[time=2351] You would just see 30 hands just going, "Boom!" That is joyfully concurring.
[time=2360] That is us saying that's right.
[time=2367] This is good.
[time=2369] That's true.
[time=2371] I joyfully concur.
[time=2374] And because I joyfully concur, I go and I do.
[time=2381] Genuinely redeemed believers don't practice sin because the Word of God, which they love
[time=2388] and inundate themselves with moves them joyfully concurring in a different direction.
[time=2394] Will there be battles?
[time=2396] Yes, we're not talking about battles.
[time=2398] We're talking about unbroken patterns of sin.
[time=2402] I love what it says in Psalm 1.
[time=2405] Psalm 1 and 2, turn there if you would.
[time=2407] Would you do that?
[time=2408] Just turn to the very first chapter in the book of Psalms.
[time=2412] How blessed is the man, chapter 1, verse 1.
[time=2415] How blessed is the man who does not walk, here it talks about sin in the first verse.
[time=2421] How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked nor stand in the path of sinners nor sit in the seat of scoffers.
[time=2430] How is it that this man doesn't engage in that sin?
[time=2435] How is it that this man doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked?
[time=2439] How is it that this man doesn't stand in the path of sinners?
[time=2442] How is it that this individual doesn't sit in the seat of scoffers because his delight,
[time=2451] what he loves, because his delight is in the what, say it, law of the Lord.
[time=2458] And in his law, he meditates day and night.
[time=2464] And because he loves it and because he delights in it and because he meditates in it, because he's inundated with it all the time, he will be like a look at the result.
[time=2474] He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in
[time=2481] its season and its leaf does not wither and whatever he does, he prospers.
[time=2487] The genuinely saved are drawn to the Word of God.
[time=2491] They delight in God's Word.
[time=2493] The Scriptures are compelling to them.
[time=2495] They can't get enough, they want to obey them.
[time=2500] Is that true of you this morning?
[time=2502] I just got to ask you that.
[time=2503] You just got to take this as an opportunity to assess whether maybe you are or you aren't
[time=2511] his or maybe it's just the encouragement that you needed to hear again today that in this
[time=2519] there is great hope, in this there is great promise, and as a believer in your battle
[time=2526] and in your fight against sin, you and I need more and more and more of this down deep in
[time=2532] our heart.
[time=2533] Number two, you can write this down, the believer that genuinely redeemed can't practice sin because sin is incompatible with the work of Christ.
[time=2542] I'll never forget sitting there 24 years ago and hearing this pastor/teacher read through,
[time=2548] well, first of all, look at the verse that it's, go back to our, go back to 1 John 3,
[time=2558] verse 5, go to 3, 5.
[time=2561] The genuinely saved doesn't practice sin because it's incompatible with the finished work of Christ, says right there in 3, 5, it says, "You know that he Christ appeared
[time=2573] in order to take away sins and in him Christ there is no what."
[time=2582] And then I remember that morning, I remember going following that pastor/teacher to Romans
[time=2588] 6, would you go there this morning to Romans 6?
[time=2593] What a powerful picture.
[time=2594] I love how the Scriptures so many times paint pictures that we can see visuals that allow
[time=2601] us to understand better this great truth and this passage is just filled with great visuals.
[time=2607] Look at Romans 6, 1, what shall we say then?
[time=2610] If you stop there for a moment, you don't have to read it but just know that at the end of chapter 5, what had been introduced into this discussion of the book of Romans was
[time=2619] the presence of the great benefit and the great blessing of grace.
[time=2624] Grace had been introduced into this dialogue relating to our sin struggle.
[time=2630] So now Paul kind of anticipating the reader's response says in the beginning of chapter 6, what shall we say then?
[time=2637] Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?
[time=2642] So that grace may increase, do you ever thought that?
[time=2647] You ever thought that?
[time=2649] You might shake your head no kind of quick but come on, think about it.
[time=2652] How many times have you said?
[time=2654] Well, I think I'll just do it.
[time=2662] Think I'll just say it, I think I'll just think it.
[time=2665] I think I'll just go there because I know grace will abound.
[time=2674] Paul says no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not it, that's not what this is
[time=2680] about.
[time=2681] It's not the mindset, it's not the perspective.
[time=2684] May it, may it, what did you say there in verse 2?
[time=2687] May it never be.
[time=2689] How shall we?
[time=2691] So now he comes to the central issue.
[time=2693] How shall we who died to sin still live in it?
[time=2696] Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized
[time=2704] into his death.
[time=2705] Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death so that as Christ was raised
[time=2713] from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too, remember we were positionally,
[time=2719] spiritually, we got raised with Christ.
[time=2725] We were there in his death.
[time=2727] We were there in his resurrection.
[time=2729] We were raised with Christ so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory
[time=2735] of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.
[time=2740] Or if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, certainly we shall also be like him in the likeness of his resurrection, knowing this, that our old self was what?
[time=2753] Crucified, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no
[time=2762] longer be what?
[time=2764] Slaves to sin, for he, here it is, somebody in the room needs to hear this this morning.
[time=2772] Somebody in the room needs to be reminded of this this morning, for he who has died is
[time=2778] what?
[time=2779] Freed from sin.
[time=2782] Look what it says in verse 12, I love this.
[time=2784] Therefore do not, therefore do not let sin reign.
[time=2790] I know God does a lot.
[time=2792] I know that, but God also says in his word that you and I are to work out our salvation in one, fear and trembling.
[time=2800] There's responsibility you and I have in this interaction.
[time=2805] Verse 12, therefore do not let you, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you
[time=2811] obey its lusts and do not, how are you going to do that?
[time=2814] How are you going to not let sin reign?
[time=2817] Well don't go on presenting the members of your body, your mind, your eyes, your hands,
[time=2826] your feet, your senses.
[time=2829] Don't go on presenting the members of your body, it says, as instruments of unrighteousness,
[time=2837] but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead and your members as instruments
[time=2846] of what?
[time=2847] Righteousness to God for sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law, but under
[time=2856] what?
[time=2857] Say it, grace.
[time=2863] Some of us in the room need to be reminded this morning that in Christ when you came and you fully surrendered your heart and life to Him.
[time=2871] That's why this is so important.
[time=2873] It's why we stand here week after week.
[time=2875] It's why friends of yours pray for you week after week.
[time=2879] It's why others come alongside and engage you in the most important discussion you'll ever have.
[time=2885] It's why those of you here this morning who don't know Him yet.
[time=2888] It's why you sense from us that we want so desperately for you to know Him because when
[time=2894] you know Him, when you come under the work of Christ, sin no longer has dominion, sin
[time=2904] no longer has power, sin no longer has control, sin can no longer hold you captive.
[time=2911] It's chains, it's bonds, it shackles have been forever removed when you are in who?
[time=2918] Say it, Christ.
[time=2922] That's huge.
[time=2923] And the genuinely redeemed can't practice sin because you can't be in that state that
[time=2930] we just described and do that.
[time=2931] You just can't, it's not how it works.
[time=2934] And you know what?
[time=2935] You don't want to.
[time=2936] You may struggle with it, you may battle with it, but you admit the struggle, you confess the failure, you're one who is about broken patterns, not unbroken patterns, no broken
[time=2947] patterns of sin.
[time=2952] You can live a life here today.
[time=2954] You can.
[time=2955] Many of you in the room need to be reminded of this.
[time=2957] You can live a life here today that is fully consistent with His character and His holiness.
[time=2965] Let's stay consistent, let me stay consistent here with our verbiage today.
[time=2969] Let me say it to you this way.
[time=2971] As a Christ follower, you can practice righteousness.
[time=2976] You can because you're in Him.
[time=2978] On your own, you can't.
[time=2982] The work of Christ, utterly complete.
[time=2984] I remember Galatians 2.20.
[time=2987] I don't know how old I was, the first time I ever had a Sunday school teacher have me memorized this verse, but I memorized it and for some reason this verse has never left me.
[time=2997] I think when I was in junior high, we used to sing a song.
[time=3001] They put some music to it, but to this day, I can just remember the great truth.
[time=3006] I have been crucified with Christ.
[time=3009] This is the great point here.
[time=3010] I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who lives, but Christ lives in
[time=3016] me in the life which I now live in the flesh.
[time=3019] I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and delivered Himself up for who?
[time=3025] For me.
[time=3028] That is the reality of life in Christ, and when you and I genuinely give ourselves to the Word of God and the work of Christ, we're not going to practice sin.
[time=3038] It won't exist in unbroken patterns.
[time=3041] I can number three, write this down, practicing sin.
[time=3046] It doesn't happen in the life of a genuinely redeemed person because the author and instigator
[time=3052] of sin has been destroyed.
[time=3054] Go back to 1 John real quick.
[time=3057] Go to 1 John 3, 8, because the author and instigator of sin has been destroyed, believers
[time=3066] no longer have to walk in it.
[time=3069] The one who practices sin, verse 8, the one who practices sin is of the devil for the devil
[time=3076] has sinned from the beginning.
[time=3078] The Son of God, here it is, appeared for this purpose to destroy the works of the who.
[time=3084] Say it.
[time=3086] I can't remember exactly when it was, but it was several years ago, and it was a brief
[time=3092] encounter that led to some opportunities for some others around here to come alongside
[time=3099] this person.
[time=3101] It wasn't a situation for me, but I had the opportunity of talking with this woman who
[time=3107] came in one day, and she was, sometimes you can just tell when someone comes in.
[time=3115] You can just tell that their heart is heavy.
[time=3117] You can tell that they've been through a great deal.
[time=3119] I looked into this woman's eyes, and I could just see immediately.
[time=3124] I could just see, and since years, it just seemed like she was tired.
[time=3131] It seemed like she was really, really weary, and she sat there, and before we ever spoke, she just cried a bit and grabbed a Kleenex and kind of got herself together, and she
[time=3142] looked at me, and she said, and it took all the courage in the world.
[time=3148] I was so grateful that she had been willing to come, and she said, "I'm a prostitute."
[time=3158] I just sat there and smiled at her, and I said, "Do you have a name?" She gave me her name, and I said, "It's nice to meet you." She said it again, "I'm a prostitute." I said, "Well, what's on your mind?" She just started to weep, and through the weeping, she lets out that her pimp of 15 years had
[time=3187] died of an overdose, and she didn't know what to do.
[time=3198] She didn't know what to think.
[time=3200] She didn't know where to go.
[time=3202] She didn't know what to say.
[time=3205] She had no clue.
[time=3206] She had been under the bondage and the captivity of this individual for so long that the very
[time=3217] thought of freedom scared her to death.
[time=3223] And so many of us in the room who know him today, the Lord, we can think back on times
[time=3230] where we didn't know him, and we were prostitutes.
[time=3235] We were held under the bondage of the evil one, and one of the great, freeing truths that
[time=3242] you and I get to experience in life, my friends, is that the instigator of the evil, that the
[time=3248] author of rebellion and deceitfulness and treachery, Jesus came to what destroy, and did
[time=3256] he?
[time=3257] Yes or no?
[time=3258] Do you joyfully concur with that?
[time=3260] Yes.
[time=3261] And that frees you and I up.
[time=3265] That frees us up to practice righteousness.
[time=3267] I want to invite the choir to come on back up, if they will, at this point.
[time=3271] We're so blessed to have these kids with us.
[time=3273] I want to remind you of a last point here, practicing sin is impossible, because sin is incompatible with the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3282] I would encourage you.
[time=3284] I would encourage you to take your Bibles and mark Galatians 5 right now, and I would encourage you today.
[time=3290] As you go home this afternoon, I would encourage you as you sit down tonight with your spouse or your family.
[time=3296] I would encourage you to read through Galatians 5, especially when you get to that point,
[time=3302] and I think verse 22, where it talks about the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=3307] The fruit of the Spirit, and when you read about the fruit of the Spirit, remember that the Spirit of God was given you.
[time=3315] You are indwelled by the Spirit of God when you genuinely come to faith in Him, and it produces in you qualities that are incompatible with ongoing, progressive, unbroken patterns
[time=3329] of sin.
[time=3330] And so this morning, if you feel like you're getting close to a pattern, this morning, if you feel like you're dangerously near the edge, I want to just remind you, the Spirit of God lives in you.
[time=3342] We're so thankful, I'm so grateful that we get to spend this time in His Word.
[time=3348] So thankful that you get to be reminded today of how we can face this battle with sin.
[time=3352] [MUSIC - 98 seconds]
