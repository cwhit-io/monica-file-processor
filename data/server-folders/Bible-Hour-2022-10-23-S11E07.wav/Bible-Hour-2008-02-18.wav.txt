[time=8] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=15] [MUSIC]
[time=20] Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=28] [MUSIC]
[time=36] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=43] [MUSIC]
[time=47] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=50] [MUSIC]
[time=58] By the Holy Spirit, men hide their faces, he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
[time=66] Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows.
[time=70] Yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him and afflicted.
[time=75] But he was pierced for our transgressions.
[time=79] He was crushed for our iniquities.
[time=81] The punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.
[time=88] [MUSIC]
[time=95] We are healed by your sacrifice, and the life that you gave.
[time=107] We are healed for you, pay the price.
[time=114] By your grace, we are saved, we are saved.
[time=124] [MUSIC]
[time=127] He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our sins.
[time=134] The punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds
[time=144] we are healed, and by his wounds we are healed, and by his wounds
[time=160] What can wash away my sin, nothing but the blood of Jesus?
[time=181] Well hello, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=189] Again, my name is Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk, and I am so grateful for that team and for this Bible Hour team and the privilege that we have to bring this broadcast to you each and every week.
[time=203] You know, every once in a while I just get reminded of why it is that we do what we do,
[time=209] and driving in here this morning, my thoughts went to the thousands of you who will watch
[time=215] this broadcast this week, the thousands of you who watch it every week, and maybe even a few of you today who are watching it for the very first time, either way.
[time=225] There's just a couple of things I wanted to say to you this morning.
[time=228] It says in Ephesians chapter 4 that in the design that God gave the church, He gave pastors
[time=235] and teachers, He gave evangelists and pastors and teachers and prophets, it says there,
[time=242] to equip the saints.
[time=244] This is part of why we do what we do here, here at Black Hawk on a Sunday morning, or
[time=250] even here on the broadcast.
[time=253] Part of our hope is that we can teach God's Word.
[time=257] Part of our desire is to make clear the Scriptures so that the great power of the Scripture
[time=263] can come and affect your life.
[time=265] We want to equip you, train you, encourage you in the truth so that you can, as a believer,
[time=271] it says there in Ephesians 4, to equip the saints.
[time=275] Saints there is a word that means those that know Him.
[time=278] We want nothing more than to encourage and equip you, those of you that know Him, to do the work of the ministry, it goes on to say there in that passage.
[time=287] I know that many of you know the Lord.
[time=290] I know many of you are actively and personally a part of other local churches and that absolutely
[time=297] thrills us.
[time=298] We want to do everything we can to encourage you in your walk with Him and build into you
[time=305] the life-changing truth of God's Word.
[time=309] But there's another segment of you.
[time=310] I know that are out there, I know because I hear from you, I know because we bump into each other and you're willing to humbly share with me your story.
[time=319] There are some who watch and you don't know Him yet.
[time=323] You're still on that journey.
[time=326] You haven't fully surrendered your heart and life to Him, but there's something about His Word and there's something about hearing it explained that draws you even closer to Him.
[time=336] It piques your interest, it stirs your soul.
[time=339] And I just want to say to you this morning, I know you're there and we're thankful that you're listening.
[time=345] The idea of why we do this is to put on display for you the great life-changing, eternity-altering
[time=352] truth of the Scripture.
[time=354] We don't want to put ourselves on display.
[time=356] We want to put Him and His truth on display so that you can see what it is.
[time=362] He's really called you to.
[time=364] What it is, He really wants to provide you with in relationship with Him.
[time=369] So I'm thankful, all that to say that all of you watch and we're so blessed to be able to have this ministry.
[time=376] So thankful for the support that you give and so thankful for the encouraging words we hear from so many of you.
[time=382] God bless you today.
[time=383] We're thankful that you've tuned in and don't forget, we'd always love to meet you.
[time=387] Come by some morning, come down front, say hello.
[time=390] We're so thankful for each and every one of you.
[time=392] Have a great week.
[time=404] I hear the Savior say, "Thy strength indeed is small, child of weakness, watch and pray.
[time=420] Find Him lead, thine all in love.
[time=426] Jesus paid it all, all to Him my own sin, had left a crimson stain, He washed it white
[time=443] as snow." The sing of His power that washes His sleep.
[time=460] Born now in divine, thy power and by alone can change the leper's spots and melt the
[time=476] heart of stone, my Jesus paid it all, all to Him my own sin, had left a crimson stain,
[time=493] He washed it white as snow.
[time=499] Let's stand together now, Her speech of standing in His presence, the Hebrew says that we have
[time=507] confidence to enter the most holy place and stand before the living God.
[time=513] And when before the throne, I stand in You complete, Jesus died, my soul to say, "My
[time=528] dear shall still be deep," that Jesus paid it all, all to Him my own.
[time=542] My sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow, sin had left a crimson stain,
[time=556] He washed it white, He washed it white as snow, He washed it white as snow.
[time=574] My sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow, sin had left a crimson stain,
[time=599] He washed it white as snow, sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow,
[time=638] sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow, sin had left a crimson stain,
[time=658] I remember studying all this literature more years ago than I cared to remember, and the
[time=664] senior lecturer who as far as I know had no particular faith, she said to me, "I believe the power of the prodigal son is the greatest short story ever written."
[time=675] The story of the boy who broke his father's heart, Dr. Luke puts it like this, and while the boy was still a long way off, his father saw him and that compassion on him, and he
[time=686] rammed him and he hugged him and he kissed him, and the boy said, "Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you, I'm no more worthy to be called your son," but the father said, "No, no, put a robe on his back and a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet." My boy's home.
[time=704] That many of us have carried a load of guilt for our prodigals, that we have no right to carry.
[time=710] It's not that we've been perfect brothers or sisters, perfect children, perfect friends,
[time=716] and especially perfect parents, we've just been parents.
[time=720] Most of the Bible is God the perfect parent crying over his children, and so often you
[time=726] are saying, "What could I have done more?" "God forgive me if only if I'd done more, if I'd lent them that fork, if I took them to that meeting about all those if only." Sometimes you have to lay down the guilt, and that sets you free at last to bring them
[time=745] to God.
[time=748] My heart has cried for my prodigals, I understand something of what you feel.
[time=753] I can't promise that, but I know this, there is no better place to bring our prodigals than
[time=759] the foot of this cross.
[time=761] As we cry out sometimes some broken hearts, Lord, wherever they are, touch them.
[time=768] Be with them.
[time=769] You love the modernists.
[time=770] Ride your grace, bring them home.
[time=776] A simple message, which has now touched the lives of millions across the world, has that
[time=788] it's hard, that each of us are totally thrown on God for our prodigals, and part of this
[time=795] evening will be crying out to the creator of the universe and saying, "Father, wherever they are, touch my prodigal and from the four corners of the earth, bring them home."
[time=806] I hope with all my heart you can share this evening with us, and cry out to God for the prodigals of your nation, your home, the prodigal God has laid on your heart.
[time=820] The prodigal ministry is a ministry that is closely connected with focus on the family.
[time=829] It's actually focused on the family, UK, and it has, over the last few years, just swept the UK.
[time=835] God doing amazing things through Rob Parsons and the prodigal ministry team as they go
[time=841] from city to city, really speaking truth and encouraging those, encouraging those who
[time=847] have experienced that experience of having one that they love, a son, a daughter, a friend,
[time=854] a family member, wander away, walk away from them, from the relationship, maybe even from
[time=863] the Lord and that which is true and right and good.
[time=867] So many of us in this country focus on the family, realize that there are so many people
[time=873] in the church today who are suffering and struggling with that reality, and it is a phenomenal, phenomenal one-night event that will really speak to your heart.
[time=884] You may have experienced, you may be experiencing this reality to some degree.
[time=890] You may have a friend or a family member who has gone through this.
[time=894] I just hope you got one of the brochures on your way in.
[time=897] If you didn't pick a couple up on your way out, this explains the event, gives you all your registration information right here, and we just want to encourage you, every one of you, to just give some thought to be in there on March 8th.
[time=909] It will be a phenomenal, phenomenal evening.
[time=912] When I was five, my dad put a hoop up in our backyard, and I, you know, you forget things
[time=924] from when you're five, you don't remember everything, but I can remember to this day him with the post-hole digger and the bag concrete, the whole nine yards and this shiny
[time=934] hoop sitting over there.
[time=935] I remember the day he put up my first hoop and he put it up at about seven feet, maybe seven and a half feet, you know, and as a little guy, it seemed once it was in and once it was all set and once I could go out there and play, but it just seemed huge.
[time=950] And I remember being five and six years old and seven years, I remember just shooting, just shooting and shooting and shooting on that thing, and I just remember just sensing early on what an enormous hoop that was.
[time=963] And I shot and shot and worked on my game, and I'll tell you what, by the time I was six, seven years old, I had pretty much in my mind an estimation mastered the game of basketball.
[time=974] It was over.
[time=975] It was like bring on the next sport, bring on the next challenge because that thing is absolutely nothing.
[time=982] And I remember another memory that has not gone away, the first time that I ever walked
[time=989] in to a real gym with a real hoop, and I just thought, oh, whoa, it's me, I'm not worthy.
[time=1001] I remember looking up at ten feet after spending about two years looking up at seven, thinking
[time=1007] oh my goodness, wow, wow, I don't even think I can throw it up there.
[time=1016] And we experience things like this in life, and it might be me in basketball.
[time=1022] It might be, I was thinking about the educational arena.
[time=1026] Some of our, I don't know what it was like, even when we were in school.
[time=1028] I don't think we had AP classes or they didn't call them AP classes, but I listened to kids
[time=1036] today talk about the AP classes that they take, AP, what's it even stand for, Steve?
[time=1044] Next placement, thank you, I guess we didn't have AP when I was in school.
[time=1050] There's like history class, right?
[time=1053] And then there's AP history, right?
[time=1057] I mean, there's English, and then there's AP, English.
[time=1061] I mean, there's classes that we take, and then there's classes that we take, and the work load, and the reading load, and the test load, I mean, everything's just, the bar just gets absolutely what, raised.
[time=1074] It's a challenge, it's tough, but it's a must, because we want to progress, we want to go ahead.
[time=1079] I mean, life is filled with these kinds of experiences, and my friends, John, in our study, back to first John here this morning, in our study of first John, John brings us
[time=1090] to a kind of a reminder, and it's not just a reminder, it's a look back in a bar that
[time=1097] gets raised, I've entitled it AP love, AP level love.
[time=1105] Your bulletin might say, what's your bulletin say?
[time=1109] So you say you love your brother, see, here's the deal, they always ask me on Monday for a sermon title, and if you know me, you know, I mean, I've thought it through on Monday, but my mind changes 18 times between Monday and Sunday, and so just reading through this again, and again, and again, I just wanted you to think with me about this AP thing, and this raised bar, it's really a pretty dramatic picture, AP level love.
[time=1135] And if you've been with us, you know, that John has in this book, this book of first John was written, because people in the church in that they needed to be reminded of what real Christianity was really about, see, the heresy of Gnosticism had made its way into
[time=1149] the church, John knew that the church and the people in the church were starting to flail in their confusion, and so God, through the pen of John, writes the epistle here, a first
[time=1159] John, second John, and third John, bringing clarity back to the foundations of the church.
[time=1166] What is real faith, and what do real followers of Christ look like?
[time=1173] And as we've been looking at this, and as we've been studying this, it's been great.
[time=1176] We've been able to look at, kind of remember, test after test after test, opportunities as the passages have progressed, just real practical opportunities for you and I to assess
[time=1187] the genuineness and the reality of our faith, not based upon what some people say, but just
[time=1194] based upon what God's word says, real, genuine faith looks like.
[time=1199] Early in the study, we came to the test of love, and it was thorough, and it was well
[time=1206] written, and it had enormous implications for you and for me.
[time=1211] But now, here we are in 1 John 3, and John brings us back to this test of love.
[time=1218] And I want you to, as we make our way through this passage, I want you to see that while what he said earlier about love is very, very pertinent and very, very important, what we now see is a bar getting raised.
[time=1233] What we now see really is further clarity on what it means to be a follower of Christ
[time=1239] who genuinely loves.
[time=1243] So it's kind of like, you know, test number two, same topic, you know, different arena,
[time=1249] bar raised, oh my goodness, pay attention, open your heart, and be willing to see this
[time=1256] morning what God will have for you.
[time=1259] And let's begin with a review, and it's not just let's begin, I mean, that's what the passage does.
[time=1265] Let me just read it for you, 1 John 3, 11 to 19 is where we'll be this morning, and we're
[time=1271] going to begin with a review of love 101, if you will.
[time=1276] Level one love, it's how he starts the passage, but then I want you to see where the passage progresses to.
[time=1281] We'll get there.
[time=1282] Let me read this for you.
[time=1283] And in honor of God's Word, it says in 1 John 3, 11, it says, "For this is the message
[time=1290] which you have heard from the beginning, and the beginning there wouldn't be Eden." We're not talking about Genesis 1, 1, we're talking about the beginning of their faith, the beginning of this church, the beginning of their journey with God.
[time=1302] When they came to faith in Christ, they heard from the beginning that this is how it works.
[time=1311] This is how it's built.
[time=1313] For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning that we should love one
[time=1319] another, not as Cain, Genesis 4, Cain and Abel, sons of Adam and Eve, the first murder
[time=1330] depicted in Scripture, not as Cain who was of the evil one and slew his brother.
[time=1338] And for what reason did he slay him because his deeds, his deeds were evil and his brother's
[time=1344] ables were righteous.
[time=1347] Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you, we know that we have passed out
[time=1353] of death into life because we love the brethren.
[time=1356] He who does not love abides in death.
[time=1360] Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer.
[time=1365] You know that no murderer, not somebody in prison, here we're talking about somebody
[time=1373] who doesn't love.
[time=1377] And we know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
[time=1381] We know love by this, verse 16, that he Christ laid down his life for us.
[time=1387] We just had the privilege of singing about that.
[time=1392] We know love by this, here's your definition of love, in other words, that he laid down
[time=1398] his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for each other, for the brethren, but whoever has the world's goods and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against
[time=1409] him, how rhetorically asked, how does the love of God abide in him?
[time=1417] It doesn't.
[time=1420] Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in what, say it, deed,
[time=1428] actions, and truth.
[time=1431] We will know by this that we are of the what, truth, and will assure our heart before him.
[time=1441] Pray with me, God, we have come into this place this morning and even already experienced your presence and your grace and God for many of us, just the thrill, the absolute thrill
[time=1455] of being in your presence and being with this family.
[time=1458] God, again, regardless of where we've come from this week, regardless of actions taken,
[time=1465] choices made, we have the privilege of coming to the cross this morning and coming before you and your word and your spirit and begging you, God, and we do that now.
[time=1476] We beg you to remove any obstacles, God, we beg you to please take away our pride, God, we beg you to remove anything that would confuse us, God, we beg you to speak to us clearly
[time=1487] this morning.
[time=1489] Move our hearts in the directions that they may need to move in.
[time=1492] God, bring clarity wherever God there may be confusion, God, I pray that you would and
[time=1498] your spirit would and your word would convict the one who is wandering.
[time=1502] God, that it would encourage the one who is following well, God, that this time would
[time=1508] move us as a people closer to you and closer to each other, and it's in your son's name
[time=1514] that we pray, amen.
[time=1517] You can be seated.
[time=1518] Well, here's how the passage kind of breaks down.
[time=1521] We're going to kind of take 11 to 15 and here in these first few verses it's as if he's
[time=1528] kind of going back to this general, very powerful, very pertinent concept of love.
[time=1532] He's giving you a few more things here to think about before he comes to verse 16 and really, really raises the bar and moves us into a graduated level of love, a level that
[time=1543] every one of us must be willing to move forward to.
[time=1547] But let's look at this, 11 to 15, a review of Love 101, Cain and Abel.
[time=1552] It says here we should, verse 11, we've heard this from the beginning, that we should love one another, not as Cain who was of the evil one and slew his brother.
[time=1562] And for what reason did he slay him because his deeds were evil and his brothers were
[time=1568] righteous, were reminded that Cain fails.
[time=1574] Speaking of tests, right, were reminded here right out of the gate that Cain fails the
[time=1580] test of genuine faith.
[time=1583] He fails the genuine faith test of love.
[time=1586] His faith is exposed and proven to be not a true faith but a false faith.
[time=1592] We're reminded that when your heart truly isn't the Lord's, as was the case with Cain,
[time=1598] we're reminded we see right here in this passage that when one's heart truly isn't the Lord's, one of the things that you do is you murder your brother.
[time=1610] When your heart isn't the Lord's, the passage reminds us that one of the things we do is we murder people.
[time=1620] And lest anyone in John's audience or anyone in this audience this morning, whether you're
[time=1627] here in the room or watching on the broadcast or listening online, lest anybody forget biblically,
[time=1636] murder isn't just defined as the taking of a physical life.
[time=1641] Biblically, murder is also defined by the presence of hatred in your heart.
[time=1651] If you're storing hatred, if you're practicing hatred back to the language of our study,
[time=1657] if you're practicing ongoing in a habitual, unbroken sense, this thing called hate, our
[time=1668] study here in 1 John then reveals that you don't know, you don't know the love of God.
[time=1677] And what is it, it's contempt.
[time=1685] When you have that feeling or you have that thought, when you can actually put a person's face or name into that sentence, into that thought, into that feeling of I, I just can't
[time=1697] stand him.
[time=1699] And not just I can't stand him, not just I can't stand or look at the definition.
[time=1704] It's actually hatred is when you actually wish them ill, hatred, wishing them ill, wishing
[time=1713] them to be troubled, wishing them to be defeated.
[time=1716] And we're not just talking about a game here, we're talking about in life.
[time=1720] It's when you wish them ill, it's despising them, it's being purposely demeaning and or
[time=1727] degrading toward them in one's thoughts or actions.
[time=1733] The scriptures remind us here of two things, right out of the gate, that if you are one
[time=1739] who hates as a pattern, you are, as it says there of Cain, you are of the evil one.
[time=1749] And that's probably just a good thing to stop and just give some thought to this morning.
[time=1754] If you are one who hates as a pattern, you are of the evil one.
[time=1759] You are a brother of Cain.
[time=1764] And two, as we look at this just initially, we see that your hatred in God's eyes is no different than murder.
[time=1770] Look what it says in verse 14, implications spiritually are huge.
[time=1775] We know that if we have passed out of death into life because we love the brethren, we know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brethren.
[time=1784] He who does not love abides in death and everyone, verse 15, who hates, hates his brother is
[time=1791] a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
[time=1798] You cannot, as a pattern, fail the test of love 101 and be saved.
[time=1806] It is impossible, it is incongruous, it doesn't work.
[time=1812] Oh, here's what would happen, watch this.
[time=1815] So there were those in John's day.
[time=1818] And there are those in this day, there are those who would kind of hear that teaching or read through that and be in a discussion about that and they would come to this conclusion that would go something like this, they would say, okay, loving meant not killing people.
[time=1832] They would begin to think this through, they would assume and they would declare that loving meant not killing people and too it meant being nice in what I said to and thought about those
[time=1843] people.
[time=1844] They would say I love you and as long as they didn't kill you, as long as they were willing to wish you well, in the spoken word they thought that this was and they believed this
[time=1854] to be love.
[time=1856] It was interesting just this week to read what some early first century church historians wrote on this very issue.
[time=1864] They wrote about how in the culture of this day that John writes people would greet, there was a common greeting, there was a very popular greeting and it would take place in the marketplace
[time=1875] and it would take place on the roadway and it would take place in any social setting.
[time=1880] And there was a popular greeting that if translated would sound something like this, hello friend
[time=1886] may you know my love, hello friend may you know my love, hello friends may you know my
[time=1892] love everywhere you'd go and everywhere I'd go, hello friend may you know my love, hello friend may you know my love, hello friend yes I see you may you know my love everywhere people went everywhere folks would go wherever they would travel there was this common everyday
[time=1907] greeting where folks would articulate their love, hello friend may you know my love.
[time=1915] And words of love, sayings of love, statements of love, promises of love, thoughts of love
[time=1924] intentions to love, conversations about love.
[time=1931] So John, God through the pin of John, knowing, listen, knowing that there's more to love
[time=1941] than a greeting raises the bar because there's more to love than a greeting and he gives an
[time=1951] explanation of this next class, this next opportunity to learn and to grow, this next
[time=1960] opportunity that God gives these people to have a wider, deeper, broader understanding
[time=1966] of true biblical love, an explanation of AP love and in verses 16 to 19 he brings further
[time=1976] like really, really bright, incredible clarity to what real genuine love really looks like,
[time=1987] what real love does and I hope you'll write that down, what real love does not just what
[time=1994] it, what not just what it says, what real love does and you see it right there, the
[time=2005] bar gets raised in verse 16, we know love by this, here's love that he laid down his
[time=2013] life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren but whoever has the world's
[time=2021] goods, actually let me just stop right there, go back to 16 we know love by this, that he
[time=2029] laid down his life, that he laid down his life, everybody say that with me, that he
[time=2039] laid down his life, one more time, that he laid down his life, my friends, this is, this
[time=2049] is the definition of love, this is the foundational principle, if you want to know about love,
[time=2058] if you want to help a kid understand love, if you want to sit with a young married couple and help them better understand love, if you want to communicate to people, the essence
[time=2069] of what it means to really love, my friends it is tied up and found in that one phrase,
[time=2075] sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, me giving up so that you can benefit me letting
[time=2086] go so you can be furthered, me, me going low so you can go high, me being willing to do
[time=2093] anything and everything I might need to do in order to communicate and evidence and show
[time=2099] my love to you, sacrifice, what Jesus did is he laid down his life, sacrifice, I hope
[time=2106] you will write that down, look at 1 Corinthians 13, if you would, just go back, those of you
[time=2112] still getting familiar with your vitals, good job, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans,
[time=2119] then comes 1 Corinthians and look at 1 Corinthians 13, how many of you had 1 Corinthians 13
[time=2125] in your wedding, raise your hand, I've done a lot of weddings and 1 Corinthians 13 is
[time=2132] just a classic passage, whenever somebody wants to know what it looks like or what it means to love, if they're looking for a definition from a scriptural perspective on what love
[time=2142] is so many people go right to 1 Corinthians 13, now you won't find in most translations
[time=2148] the word sacrifice but watch this, watch how sacrifice is absolutely and fundamentally
[time=2158] present in every single thing that God says love is about.
[time=2167] 1 Corinthians 13, 1 Corinthians 13 starting in verse 4, love is patient, think about it,
[time=2177] love is patient, it sacrifices so, in order for you and I to be patient, I'm just going
[time=2185] to kind of go through here real quick, if love is patient then it sacrifices personal demands, if I'm going to be patient with you I may have 15 things, I wish you would
[time=2198] be doing, I may have 15 things that I think you should have accomplished but my love is going to be patient so I'm going to sacrifice personal demands, if love is kind then my
[time=2210] friends love sacrifices rudeness, love sacrifices a mean and critical spirit because love is
[time=2219] what, love is kind, if love is not jealous it sacrifices doubt, I'm not going to be jealous
[time=2229] of her, I'm not going to be jealous of him, I'm not going to doubt, I'm going to sacrifice his doubt and trust, love is not jealous, love does not brag, so love sacrifices pride,
[time=2242] you can write these down, love is not arrogant, so if love is an arrogant then that means
[time=2249] love sacrifices selfishness, if love doesn't act unbecomingly then it means that true love
[time=2257] sacrifices the inappropriate, we're not going to go there, we're not going to do that, we're not going to say that, we're not going to watch that, we're just not going to, it sacrifices the inappropriate because love, true love does not act unbecomingly, love, real love
[time=2273] doesn't seek its own, so real love sacrifices, personal agendas, it's not about me, it's
[time=2282] about you and it's about everything I can do to help meet your need, help encourage
[time=2288] your heart, love does not seek its own, so personal agendas get sacrificed, it's not
[time=2294] provoked, it's not provoked, real love is not provoked, so in order for my love to
[time=2301] not be provoked I sacrifice personal rights because that's what happens, you do things
[time=2307] and say things and I feel like my rights have been violated, I feel like you shouldn't do that to me, you shouldn't talk to me that way, you shouldn't do this or that and so because I'm hanging on to my rights my love gets provoked but real love doesn't get provoked
[time=2322] because real love has sacrificed to an appropriate level, those rights doesn't take into account
[time=2332] a wrong suffered, real love doesn't take into account a wrong suffered which then means real love has sacrificed all grudges, I can't hold a grudge against you, I can't, I can't
[time=2346] keep a long list because real love doesn't keep a list so all grudges are gone, sacrifice,
[time=2354] sacrifice, sacrifice, it doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness so I sacrifice evil pleasure,
[time=2366] it bears all things, it bears all things, it believes, you see that, it believes all
[time=2373] things, I said I believe, real love believes in God, real love believes in truth, real
[time=2382] love believes and so I sacrifice fear, real love hopes, so I sacrifice pessimism, I sacrifice
[time=2394] pessimism because I have real love, real love hopes, real love endures, I sacrifice resignation.
[time=2404] Sacrifice my friends is the word you want to remember when you think about really loving and Christ in verse 16 back to our passage in first John 3, Christ physically sacrifices,
[time=2414] he laid himself down, didn't have to, you didn't deserve it, I didn't warrant it but
[time=2421] he expresses the ultimate picture of love by laying himself down so how about you?
[time=2427] I know for me when it comes to this issue of physical or personal sacrifice, I mean it's
[time=2434] a great picture and I would take a bullet, I would take a bullet from my loved ones, I
[time=2440] would die in a heartbeat for those that I loved.
[time=2446] Many of you would do the same and it is noble, you know you might think well anybody would but no it's a noble, valiant thing you and I expressing our love and that we'd be willing to lose our life so they might live, I would do that, who in the room would do that for
[time=2461] your loved ones?
[time=2463] Alright but watch this, now here in the text John brings the further clarity we referenced
[time=2470] earlier because it's not just about what I die for you, God's word now in this passage
[time=2480] says that's good but how about would I feed you?
[time=2489] Would I give you a drink of water?
[time=2495] Would I put a roof over your head?
[time=2498] Would I resource you in your time of need and see the weird deal on this one is that
[time=2506] right now there wouldn't be as many hands going up?
[time=2512] We'll die for our loved ones as we should but now we come to the biblical definition
[time=2518] A.P. love and watch where it goes and watch the turmoil, watch the tension that exists and so many of us as we start to think this through look at verse 17 if you wouldn't.
[time=2530] Verse 17, I kind of started here a minute ago then I stopped, let's go back to it, first John 3, 17, but whoever has the world's goods, you see that?
[time=2542] Does it read differently in other translations?
[time=2546] Does it say goods in everybody's Bible?
[time=2551] What else does it say?
[time=2553] Material possessions, okay?
[time=2556] Verse 17 there, but whoever has the world's goods, whoever has the world's material possessions
[time=2563] and you might just like real quick in your mind when you hear the world's goods or when you hear the world's material possessions, just I think it's, we don't want to get general there, I think it's important for you and I to be very, very specific here because this is God's definition of what this love that you profess to have as it gets played out,
[time=2580] this is what it involves.
[time=2581] It says those who possess the world's goods and that word in the Greek means this, the necessities, I just wrote it down, the necessities of water, food, shelter, clothing and resources.
[time=2594] That word means, that phrase means the necessities of water, food, shelter, clothing and resources.
[time=2603] Raise your hand if you have all those.
[time=2606] Raise them high, all right.
[time=2611] But whoever has the world's goods and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against
[time=2620] him.
[time=2621] How does the love of God abide in him?
[time=2625] Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue but in what, say it, deed and
[time=2632] in truth.
[time=2635] If friends remember this, God, God knew, sometimes I think I listen to folks in the church today
[time=2641] talk and I'll listen to people discuss this issue of hunger or disease or famine or turmoil.
[time=2649] I hear people talk about the absolute atrocities that people are facing today and it's almost
[time=2655] as if you listen to them talk, it's like somehow this thing they think snuck up on God.
[time=2661] But it's a new thing and I just want to remind you that the moment, the moment she bit the apple, the moment he bit the apple, the moment Adam and Eve, the instant they chose to do
[time=2676] what they did, he knew then that this thing was going to be broken.
[time=2682] He knew then that this creation of his was going to be cracked.
[time=2685] He knew then of the need and the hurt and the sorrow and the loss and the going without
[time=2692] the people would in this what was supposed to be perfect creation.
[time=2696] He knew then.
[time=2700] He knew that in the midst of a broken, cracked and faulty creation, there would be people in need and we've talked about this before, yes, sometimes they're needy due to their own sin and sometimes they're needy due to the oppressive sin of others.
[time=2714] Sometimes they're without because they made bad choices and sometimes they're without because they're without and nowhere, not one place in this entire book on this topic
[time=2727] of you and I exercising compassion.
[time=2730] Does it ever tell you to figure that out to then determine who you're going to be kind to?
[time=2736] Never.
[time=2739] Does it ever say to you or to me, figure out if they're needy and it's their fault?
[time=2744] So, you can brush him aside and tell him to get a job and then only focus on the ones
[time=2751] who are needy because it wasn't there.
[time=2752] No, it just says and he knew from the beginning there would be those in need.
[time=2759] He just puts a blanket over the whole thing and says, "Look, people, there are those who don't possess the world's goods.
[time=2767] And if you have water and if you have food and if you have shelter and if you have clothing and if you have resources and you see someone who doesn't, if you come across an opportunity
[time=2778] to help someone who doesn't have the necessities and you're not willing to share."
[time=2785] This is back to blocks in a toddler's room.
[time=2789] This is back to hot wheels in the backyard.
[time=2792] This is about sharing.
[time=2802] If you're unwilling to help while graciously coming alongside, then according to the scriptures, listen, not according to Kelly, not according to Blackhawk, not according to where I got trained, not according to any denomination, according to the scriptures, you're not a genuine believer.
[time=2819] The love of God doesn't abide in you.
[time=2822] You are of the evil one like Cain.
[time=2825] If the practice and habit of your heart is to turn your nose up and walk in the other
[time=2832] direction when we encounter those in need, not saved, not a child of God.
[time=2841] And look, don't miss this.
[time=2843] Look at the text, not because you didn't give cash.
[time=2848] We find this out about ourselves, we find this out about people that they're not genuinely
[time=2854] of Him, not because they didn't give the cash, not because they didn't help drill a well or deliver clothing to the poor, but because verse 17.
[time=2862] Look at verse 17, but because they closed their what?
[time=2868] Because they closed their heart, because what that really means is the genuine state of their heart is revealed.
[time=2875] And salvation, my friends, being a child of God has always been an issue of the what?
[time=2881] The heart.
[time=2884] It closed their hearts.
[time=2886] It's not the deeds that save you.
[time=2891] The deeds give evidence that you have a redeemed and transformed heart.
[time=2897] And I want to just encourage you this morning, I want to encourage you students, I want to encourage you kids, I want to encourage you moms and dads and single adults and senior adults, I want to encourage every one of you.
[time=2907] I know many of you, you genuinely do love Him and you've genuinely surrendered your heart
[time=2913] and life to Him.
[time=2914] I want to encourage you this morning to give thought to how you would this week express
[time=2920] that and evidence that in the way that you manage your goods.
[time=2927] And would you be willing this morning?
[time=2930] Would you be willing this morning individually as a small group, as a family, as a class?
[time=2939] Would you be willing this week to pray, beginning tonight, pray with me, beginning tonight, God, not a hard prayer to say maybe a challenging one to work out.
[time=2951] God, show me the needs of others.
[time=2956] Would you pray that?
[time=2958] Would you pray through this whole week?
[time=2960] God, allow my need, perception, and tenor to be up.
[time=2966] God, would you show me the needs, the physical needs, water, food, clothing, just basic help
[time=2975] that they might need in my work setting, in my home, in my neighborhood, across the street,
[time=2982] here in Blackhawk, inside or outside these four walls.
[time=2985] Would you pray that?
[time=2988] Oh God, would you please show me the needs.
[time=2991] And then I just want you to write these two things down.
[time=2994] Be ready to exercise.
[time=2995] Watch this.
[time=2996] Two things.
[time=2997] Write these down.
[time=2998] Be ready to exercise.
[time=2999] Small, spontaneous acts of kindness, small, spontaneous, personal, private, just you.
[time=3009] I'm not talking about you showing up in the paper next week.
[time=3013] I'm not talking about a billboard.
[time=3015] I'm not talking about you announcing it to the world.
[time=3017] I'm saying, would you get on your knees tonight?
[time=3020] And would you beg God to help you be sensitive to the needs of others in your world, wherever
[time=3026] you might go?
[time=3027] And then would He prompt you?
[time=3029] Would you just beg Him to prompt you to spontaneously be willing to stop in the grocery store,
[time=3036] to stop downtown, to stop wherever you might be, because you saw it.
[time=3041] It's like that commercial.
[time=3044] Many of us have seen on TV where the one person stops the one guy from walking out in the street, and then the person in the car sees the person stopping the one guy, and then the person in the car, later on in their day, they do a deed of kindness that someone else watches, and then this thing just gets cyclical, and would you just privately and personally
[time=3067] show yourself to be a child of God, because children of God love, and not just in words,
[time=3075] but in deeds.
[time=3078] Second thing I want you to write down, carefully think through a family effort.
[time=3083] Some of you in the room have the opportunity to sit down tonight at a table with two, three, four, five, six, seven, gosh, there's some family opportunity.
[time=3093] Would you this week think of a family opportunity?
[time=3096] This one, I'll do it with mine.
[time=3099] Would you do it with yours?
[time=3101] One, thought through opportunity for you as a family to go and meet a need.
[time=3107] Somehow, some way, I'm not going to get it all defined for you.
[time=3111] Do something kind and thoughtful for somebody who's got a need, and do it as a family, and
[time=3118] in the process teach little ones what it looks like to not just say we love, but to do love.
[time=3125] Hey, I'll let you go, but I want to share this with you.
[time=3128] I think it's important it's just kind of hammers home that same point.
[time=3131] In fact, verse 18 hammers at home, would you look at it with me?
[time=3135] Look at verse 18.
[time=3137] This is powerful.
[time=3138] Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed, in action, in
[time=3146] the doing, and in truth.
[time=3149] It says in verse 19, we will know by this that we are of the truth.
[time=3154] We will know that we are of the truth when we do it.
[time=3159] Hey, listen, you know how many times, either in my office, you know, in kind of a formal
[time=3166] setting, or you know what, just in life with just friends of mine growing up, maybe even
[time=3172] some of you in this room, how many times have we sat with a young gal?
[time=3179] How many times have we been friends with a young gal who has met a young guy?
[time=3185] How many times in the midst of that journey as that young gal and that guy, and maybe they're, you know, an older gal and an older guy.
[time=3193] It's just this time of the deal where love starts to blossom, right?
[time=3201] And you get the updates and you say, "How's it going?" And you get a little, you know, update here, update there.
[time=3205] Well, then one day, one day it happens.
[time=3209] And she's been waiting for it.
[time=3211] Gals are like this, and it's a good thing, not a bad thing.
[time=3215] Gals, they wait for this day, they long for the day, I've even heard of gals having parties
[time=3223] together when the day finally comes, but they look forward to the day when he says it.
[time=3233] It's like stop the presses stuff.
[time=3235] It's like phone calls get made and emails go out.
[time=3238] And he said it, and what did he say to her?
[time=3242] Everybody in the whole room say it right now.
[time=3244] "I love you." He said, "I love you." I mean, they send out cards about it.
[time=3250] I mean, they tell everybody about it, and the guy's just kind of standing there going, "Yeah, I said it." And he probably even meant it.
[time=3262] I didn't mean it to sound that way, but here's the deal.
[time=3274] Here's the sad part, 10, 15 years later, they're in my office.
[time=3285] And too many times, I wish it were different.
[time=3288] Too many times, she's sitting there trying to talk through her tears.
[time=3296] And if she can get it out, what she says is, "I wish he would stop saying it, and I wish
[time=3306] for once he would do it." And I understand the great value, and I understand the great thrill of having heard it said.
[time=3320] Greetings, my friend, and you know my love.
[time=3324] But it just never really gets there, does it?
[time=3327] It just never really gets validated.
[time=3329] It just never really is authentic.
[time=3331] It's never true AP love until you're willing to do it, sacrificially, again, and again,
[time=3345] and again, and again, and again.
[time=3348] And I am so grateful that God loved me that way, you.
[time=3354] And I just hope that you and I would be people who would, if we know him, and I know many of you do.
[time=3360] I hope you're willing to evidence that kind of love.
[time=3363] I'm thankful that you're willing to say it.
[time=3365] I want you to show it.
[time=3368] And if you need help, ask, and we'll do everything we can to help you be one who loves.
[time=3377] Amen?
[time=3378] Let's pray.
[time=3380] You can stand if you would, please.
[time=3381] God, thanks for the morning.
[time=3383] We say that, and we mean it, God.
[time=3385] Thank you for this morning and the privilege that we have found in it to be together and to be with you.
[time=3392] And to look at your word and allow it to do what only it can do, God, it exposes us.
[time=3397] God, it just lays us bare.
[time=3401] It sees deep into the places of our life that desperately need it, your word and your spirit.
[time=3409] Parts of our lives, God, that desperately need you.
[time=3412] I know, God, if there are people in the room this morning that need you, there are those that need to know you personally, if there are those in the room this morning that would want to, and feel ready to fully surrender and devote themselves to you, God, to enter
[time=3428] into a life-changing relationship with you, God, I pray they'd come down this morning and give us the privilege of helping them talk and think and pray that through.
[time=3438] God, if there are those with needs in the room that could just use a word of prayer and an encouraging hand, I pray, God, that it allow us to connect.
[time=3448] Father, God, if there are those in the room that need a small community of people, smaller than this room, while I know they're thankful for this setting, God, if there are those who would like to be in a small group where they could get to know others and be encouraged and have the privilege of furthering this discussion and others like it, God, I pray
[time=3466] that they would let us know so we could help them connect.
[time=3470] God, we thank you that your son laid down his life.
[time=3474] God, would you give us the strength to be people who are willing to lay down ours as
[time=3480] well?
[time=3481] Your son's an Indian friend.
[time=3482] [AMEN]
[time=3500] [MUSIC], God, I pray that you are willing to be the one who is willing to live in the world.
[time=3525] [MUSIC]
