[time=220] [MUSIC]
[time=228] Scene one, the birth of Jesus.
[time=232] Or welcome to our world.
[time=235] One silent night in the town of Bethlehem.
[time=238] The sound of a newborn baby was heard from the depths of a filthy stable.
[time=241] Meanwhile, out on the fields nearby, some shepherds were watching their sheep.
[time=249] Dudes, dudes.
[time=250] When suddenly an angel appeared in the sky.
[time=252] Dudes, dudes, dudes.
[time=258] Relax, dudes.
[time=261] I mean, do not be afraid.
[time=263] God has sent me with good news.
[time=265] The Savior has been born.
[time=266] He's here.
[time=267] Go to Bethlehem and you'll find him there.
[time=268] Dudes.
[time=271] The shepherds did find Jesus in the stable in Bethlehem.
[time=274] And after they had worshiped him, they went and told everyone about the new king that had been born.
[time=279] But when word reached King Herod in Jerusalem, he was furious.
[time=283] I'm furious.
[time=284] He was afraid that this new king might try to take over his throne.
[time=287] I'm afraid that this new king may try to take over.
[time=290] You just said that.
[time=292] Uh-huh.
[time=292] Oh, God, bring me those three travelers that are following that star at Bethlehem.
[time=305] Okay, you three kings of Orientar, right?
[time=309] Yeah.
[time=310] Varying gifts, you traverse afar, right?
[time=315] What's he talking about?
[time=316] Just smiling, not.
[time=317] All right, all right, all right, all right, listen up.
[time=321] When you find this king you're looking for, I want you to come and tell me so that I may kill.
[time=326] So that may worship him, yes.
[time=331] I got a thing to do.
[time=333] Bye.
[time=334] Psycho, gotta go.
[time=335] That's hot for now.
[time=338] And so the three wise men follow the star until they found Jesus.
[time=343] Joseph, someone's at the door.
[time=348] Who is it?
[time=350] It's the wise men.
[time=352] The wise men's.
[time=355] Joseph, do we know the wise men's?
[time=357] Hello.
[time=364] Hey, Fred, out.
[time=366] We've come to worship the king.
[time=367] We brought gifts.
[time=368] Go.
[time=368] Wow.
[time=369] Frank and sense.
[time=371] And mer.
[time=373] Oh, more mer.
[time=374] Oh, did you already get mer?
[time=376] Oh, you can never have enough mer.
[time=377] I knew we should have gone with guitar hero, but you could take it back.
[time=380] We brought the receipt.
[time=381] It's okay, he'll love it.
[time=382] So the three wise men worship the baby Jesus, and God had warned them not to go back to Herod.
[time=389] So they went home another way.
[time=393] I knew we should have taken that left turn it down, but koyke.
[time=396] Well, somebody would have stopped desperate for directions.
[time=398] Herod still tried to have Jesus killed, but God protected Joseph, Mary, and Jesus.
[time=403] And they eventually made their way back to their hometown of Nazareth.
[time=406] And to make a long story short.
[time=408] Do it.
[time=409] Jesus grew up.
[time=410] Scene two, the life of Jesus.
[time=413] Or so that's what it's supposed to look like.
[time=416] Who knew?
[time=417] When Jesus was 30 years old, he knew the time had come for him to do what he was sent to earth to do.
[time=423] To teach people how God wanted them to live, and then to die, and rise again.
[time=427] So he went out into the wilderness, where a group had gathered to hear a wild man named John teach.
[time=434] I am John the Baptist.
[time=436] Okay, so I look weird.
[time=440] Yeah, duh.
[time=441] Okay, so I ate weird things like honey and locusts.
[time=444] Did he say locusts?
[time=446] It's been like bugs?
[time=448] Oh, locs.
[time=449] Okay, but I bring you an important message.
[time=452] You see, the old way of doing things is almost over.
[time=454] No longer will we have to sacrifice animals to pay for our sins.
[time=458] No longer will we have to work our way to God by doing good things.
[time=461] What?
[time=462] Are you serious?
[time=463] Yes, there is one coming who has the power to pay for our sins once and for all.
[time=468] It's not me, but he's coming soon.
[time=469] If you want to follow him, come down and be baptized as a sign of that.
[time=472] But the Pharisees, who were the Jewish religious leaders of the day,
[time=478] did not like what they were hearing.
[time=482] In my day, we didn't go around getting baptized.
[time=485] We offered God and animals a sacrifice and then beat ourselves with a pain stick and we liked it.
[time=492] Jesus arrived and was baptized by John.
[time=497] Jesus, I should be baptized by you and yet you come to me.
[time=502] Yes, it is right that we do this.
[time=509] The crowd scattered and Jesus traveled deeper into the wilderness to be alone with God and prepared to do his work.
[time=514] He went without food or water for 40 days a night so he could be totally focused on God.
[time=519] But during this time of hunger and weakness, someone paid him a visit.
[time=524] Jesus, Satan.
[time=536] Look, I don't mean to pry, but why don't you turn them rocks there into bread to have a little something to eat? What do you say? No.
[time=542] All right. Well, how about this then?
[time=549] See the highest point of the temple up there?
[time=550] Why don't you just go on up there and throw yourself off?
[time=553] God's going to send his angels to catch you and everybody's going to see how cool you are.
[time=556] What do you say?
[time=563] Well, how about this then, boy? See all of them kingdoms of the world out there?
[time=568] I'll give them all to you, and all you got to do is bow down and worship little old me.
[time=572] What do you say?
[time=573] Not going to do it, Satan.
[time=576] You know the rules. Do not tempt the Lord, your God.
[time=580] Now beat it.
[time=582] Jesus was now ready to begin his work.
[time=587] He started out by picking some helpers, 12 men that would follow him everywhere and help him teach.
[time=592] Come and follow me.
[time=594] And they did.
[time=595] Peter.
[time=596] Andrew.
[time=597] John.
[time=598] James.
[time=604] The other James.
[time=606] Matthew.
[time=608] Philip.
[time=611] Thomas.
[time=612] Barre.
[time=614] Almeu.
[time=614] That is.
[time=616] Simon.
[time=618] And Judas.
[time=623] And for the next three years, the disciples followed Jesus around as he traveled all over the area telling people about God.
[time=629] And during these three years, Jesus did many miracles.
[time=633] I turned this water into wine.
[time=634] Little girl, get up. You're not dead. You're just asleep.
[time=638] A lion's man. Open your eyes and see.
[time=641] Paralyzed man. Pick up your mat and walk.
[time=644] And on and on like this.
[time=647] But the Pharisees grew even more jealous of Jesus.
[time=653] In my day, we didn't go around healing people.
[time=656] If you were blind, you stayed blind.
[time=659] If you were dead, you stayed dead.
[time=661] We were miserable and we liked it.
[time=663] And during these three years, Jesus taught many, many things.
[time=669] If someone hurt you, let it go.
[time=677] Do not try to get even.
[time=678] No way.
[time=681] Yes, way.
[time=682] And if you want to be great, you must learn to serve one another.
[time=686] No way.
[time=689] Yes, way.
[time=690] And if you want to honor God, keep your heart and your mind pure as well as your actions.
[time=695] No way.
[time=698] Yes, way.
[time=699] And on and on like this.
[time=703] Well, Jesus had taught in a way that people never heard of before.
[time=706] And the Pharisees grew to hate Jesus.
[time=709] In my day, we didn't say things like don't get even.
[time=712] If someone wronged us, we got revenge.
[time=714] We were miserable selfish and greedy and we liked it.
[time=717] And during these three years, Jesus met many people and changed their lives forever.
[time=725] Hi, my name is Jairus.
[time=734] Jairus?
[time=737] Jesus brought my daughter back from the dead.
[time=738] He gave her back to me.
[time=740] He's changed my life forever.
[time=741] Hi, my name is Martha.
[time=748] You know, I used to be so busy that I never even had time to sit and talk with Jesus.
[time=754] But then he showed me that the most important thing is just to be with him.
[time=758] I'm a Samaritan woman.
[time=766] Hi, Samaritan!
[time=767] Oh, I know, I know.
[time=769] Most Jews hate Samaritans, but but Jesus was my friend.
[time=773] He accepted me.
[time=774] He changed me forever.
[time=776] And on and on like this.
[time=783] Well, now the Pharisees grew to just despise Jesus.
[time=787] In my day, we didn't go around changing people.
[time=792] We were lucky we even changed our underwear.
[time=796] And we liked it!
[time=797] And during these three years, the disciples followed Jesus faithfully.
[time=804] Even though they didn't seem to understand a lot of what Jesus said.
[time=806] Okay, did he just say, what's that all the cheese makers?
[time=813] No, no, I think it was peacemakers.
[time=815] And did he say after three days the bread will rise?
[time=818] No, I think he said after three days that he would rise.
[time=822] What's that supposed to mean?
[time=823] I don't know.
[time=824] Okay, okay, wait.
[time=825] If he is the son of God, then why don't we sometimes call him the son of man?
[time=830] Oh, it's easy.
[time=831] It's because he's like the son of God, right?
[time=833] And he's like the son of man, and yeah, you get it?
[time=839] My head hurts.
[time=841] My head too.
[time=841] But even though they didn't understand it all, they still followed him.
[time=846] And during those three years, tons of other stuff happened.
[time=850] In an amazing story today, Jesus took five loads of bread and two fish, and miraculously made enough food to feed five thousand more at six.
[time=860] Stand by for news.
[time=862] Over the Sea of Galilee today, Jesus calms a violent storm by simply telling it to be still.
[time=868] We'll be tracking that storm later on tonight with pinpoint viper, HD.
[time=877] Reports confirmed today that the man known as Jesus was seen walking on water near the town of Geneserit.
[time=882] That and other stories at 11.
[time=884] During a funeral today in the town of Nain, a young man who had been dead got up and started talking.
[time=889] Now moments before, eyewitnesses report that Jesus of Nazareth was seen touching the coffin and said young man, get up.
[time=896] Jesus was not available for comment.
[time=898] Good day?
[time=902] In Jerusalem today, crowds gathered at the city gates and waved palm branches.
[time=907] What caused all this excitement, you may ask?
[time=909] Well, it was not the entrance of the governor's chariot, and many has believed, but rather a single man riding a donkey.
[time=914] This man was identified as Jesus of Nazareth, who many claimed to be the promised Messiah.
[time=919] What an exciting way to begin this week's Passover Festivities.
[time=922] I'm Steve Green, reporting in Channel 12 News, Jerusalem.
[time=925] And to make a long story short.
[time=928] Too late.
[time=929] Jesus did many other things as well.
[time=931] And yet the Pharisees now hated Jesus more than ever.
[time=934] In my day, we didn't go around following every little Jewish carpenter who claimed to be the Messiah.
[time=941] The people followed the Pharisees.
[time=942] We were popular, and we liked it.
[time=947] The time has come, my friends, to do something about this Jesus.
[time=952] Which leads us to scene three, the death of Jesus.
[time=958] The Pharisees arranged to have Jesus betrayed by Judas and arrested.
[time=962] They handed Jesus over to the governor and convinced the governor to have him killed.
[time=966] Jesus was nailed to a cross where he hung in pain for several hours before he finally died.
[time=972] Jesus had paid the price for all the sins of the world, and the disciples went home, thinking everything was over.
[time=981] Scene four, the resurrection.
[time=984] Early on the third day, a woman named Mary went to the tomb, but when she got there, the tomb was empty.
[time=990] She ran to find the disciples, but when she found them, they didn't believe her.
[time=994] What's wrong with you saying Jesus is still alive?
[time=995] That's crazy talk, Missy.
[time=996] That's not right.
[time=997] No, it's true.
[time=998] Yes, it is.
[time=999] Jesus.
[time=1004] Hey, Jesus, it's so good to see you.
[time=1007] Hey, do you remember the other day we were having a meal together, and you were telling us that you were going to come back from the dead, and we didn't get it?
[time=1013] Do you remember that hodge?
[time=1015] Yes.
[time=1017] That was awesome.
[time=1019] Thanks, but this is just the beginning.
[time=1024] I have a job for you to do.
[time=1026] And Jesus went on to tell them about the adventure that still awaited them, for all of his believers, that they would be the ones to spread the message about him to the whole world, and then he left them to go get heaven ready for his followers.
[time=1039] All right, boys.
[time=1041] Telling everybody about Jesus is probably going to be the toughest thing we've ever done.
[time=1046] You win?
[time=1046] Let's do it.
[time=1048] Scene five, the church starts.
[time=1060] Or today Jerusalem, tomorrow, the world.
[time=1065] The disciples all stayed in the town of Jerusalem for several days,
[time=1074] just as Jesus had told them to do.
[time=1076] But on a day called Pentecost, God sent them a gift.
[time=1079] Oh, a gift?
[time=1080] Oh, he shouldn't have.
[time=1081] Oh, it's a candy.
[time=1082] I just love candy.
[time=1083] It's not, it's not candy.
[time=1084] It's a, it's a bike.
[time=1085] It's a bike.
[time=1087] Not a bike.
[time=1087] It's a TV.
[time=1088] Not a bike.
[time=1088] It's a TV.
[time=1089] TV.
[time=1089] Look, if you would just zip it, I will tell you.
[time=1091] Let me guess what we're doing.
[time=1092] You would just zip it, I would tell you.
[time=1104] The gift he sent was the Holy Spirit.
[time=1108] This is what I'm saying.
[time=1112] On the day of Pentecost, God sent the Holy Spirit to the first disciples in an amazing way, a violent wind blew and filled the whole house where they were.
[time=1121] And then something that looked like tongues of fire came down from heaven and kind of rested on their heads.
[time=1126] My hair.
[time=1127] Oh, it's okay.
[time=1128] It didn't burn.
[time=1129] Oh, sorry.
[time=1130] It was the Holy Spirit.
[time=1132] The disciples now had all the power they needed to carry out the mission.
[time=1135] Jesus had given them.
[time=1136] And God still gives the Holy Spirit to every person who decides to follow him.
[time=1141] The disciples begin to spread the word about Jesus.
[time=1144] Hi.
[time=1145] My name is Peter.
[time=1146] I'm Peter.
[time=1148] Amy.
[time=1149] You're Philip, Tom.
[time=1150] All right.
[time=1152] You're Peter.
[time=1153] Hi.
[time=1155] My name is Peter.
[time=1156] Let me tell you about Jesus.
[time=1157] Hi.
[time=1158] My name is Philip.
[time=1158] Let me tell you about Jesus.
[time=1160] Hi.
[time=1160] My name is Bartholomew.
[time=1161] Let me tell you about Jesus.
[time=1163] Sometimes people listened.
[time=1165] And huge numbers of people became Christians.
[time=1167] Yes.
[time=1168] But, um, I'm, uh.
[time=1172] Hi.
[time=1174] My name is Steven.
[time=1175] Let me tell you about Jesus.
[time=1179] Ah.
[time=1180] It didn't work out quite so well.
[time=1181] Many of the Jewish leaders were against the message of Jesus and persecuted the disciples by beating them, imprisoning them, and even killing them.
[time=1190] So many of the disciples fled away from Jerusalem to the surrounding areas.
[time=1194] But that only helped to spread the message of Christ farther than ever.
[time=1198] Scene six.
[time=1200] The church grows.
[time=1202] Or they love you everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.
[time=1207] As the message spreads, so did the opposition.
[time=1209] People began actually hunting down Christians to stop them from spreading the message.
[time=1213] One of the most effective Christian hunters was a guy named Saul.
[time=1216] I am Saul.
[time=1218] And this message about Jesus is wrong.
[time=1220] And I'm going to stop them from spreading it.
[time=1222] Even if I have to kill them all.
[time=1224] Oh, like no.
[time=1226] All right.
[time=1226] Who said that?
[time=1227] But Saul was changed forever when Jesus appeared to him on the road to Damascus.
[time=1230] Saul, why do you hurt me like this?
[time=1234] What?
[time=1236] Who's there?
[time=1237] It is I, Jesus, the one you persecute.
[time=1239] Well, get up.
[time=1242] Go into the city.
[time=1243] I have plans for you.
[time=1245] But when he got up from the ground and opened his eyes, he found that he couldn't see anything.
[time=1249] Help, I'm fine.
[time=1251] He made his way to the town of Damascus where a man named Dannon, Nannon, Nannon, Nannon, Nannon, Nannon.
[time=1264] Thank you.
[time=1265] And an I.
[time=1267] Spound him.
[time=1267] Very nice.
[time=1268] Saul, personal space.
[time=1273] The Lord sent me to find you.
[time=1276] I'm here to help you see again.
[time=1278] Jesus gave Ananias the power to heal Saul.
[time=1280] And immediately Saul could see again.
[time=1282] I can see again.
[time=1284] I have seen Jesus.
[time=1285] I know he is, who they say he is.
[time=1288] I believe.
[time=1290] And to make a long story short, too late, Saul went to Jerusalem, joined the disciples, and began spreading the message of Jesus everywhere.
[time=1298] Okay, boys.
[time=1299] Before I go out on tour, I was thinking of going under a different name, you know, since I don't kill Christians anymore.
[time=1305] How about Methuselah?
[time=1306] That's a nice name.
[time=1307] I was thinking of something a little more cutting edge, like the artist formerly known as Saul.
[time=1314] What do you think?
[time=1315] How about just Paul?
[time=1317] You think simple is best?
[time=1319] I really do.
[time=1320] Okay, Paul it is.
[time=1321] Paul went traveling on three different tours, telling people everywhere he went about the message of Jesus.
[time=1327] Everywhere he went, lots of people became followers of Jesus.
[time=1330] But everywhere he went, people who opposed the message tried to stop him.
[time=1334] He was beaten.
[time=1336] Ow.
[time=1337] Made fun of.
[time=1337] Hey.
[time=1338] And tortured.
[time=1339] Yikes.
[time=1341] While in the town of Philippi, Paul and his friend Silas were thrown into prison.
[time=1345] But even in prison, they remained joyful.
[time=1347] Hey, this isn't so bad.
[time=1349] But that night, God sent an earthquake.
[time=1352] The prison doors flew open.
[time=1353] And when the jailer arrived, he freaked because he thought everyone had escaped and he knew that he would be killed.
[time=1358] So he raised his sword to kill himself when...
[time=1361] Hold up.
[time=1362] We're still here.
[time=1363] The jailer was amazed.
[time=1364] And Paul told him about Jesus.
[time=1366] He and his whole family became believers.
[time=1369] And next day...
[time=1370] Hey, Paul, Silas!
[time=1372] The city officials have ordered your release.
[time=1374] You're free to go!
[time=1375] I'm gonna miss you guys.
[time=1380] Group hug.
[time=1382] I love you, man.
[time=1385] Well, that wasn't the last time Paul had trouble.
[time=1390] Paul returned to Jerusalem after his third tour.
[time=1392] And he had barely been there a week when...
[time=1395] Hey!
[time=1395] That's the guy!
[time=1397] That's the guy that's always talking about that.
[time=1398] That's Jesus stuff.
[time=1401] Hey, that stuff makes fun of our lord.
[time=1404] Yeah!
[time=1404] Let's get him!
[time=1405] Yeah!
[time=1405] The crowd closed in on Paul and began to beat him.
[time=1410] But...
[time=1412] Extra extra policy from riding crowds by Roman soldiers.
[time=1415] Read out about it.
[time=1416] Paul has put on trial before the Jewish leaders of the Roman King.
[time=1419] Out of the presses, Paul is in Roman awaiting trial with Emperor Caesar.
[time=1423] Read all about it.
[time=1424] Extra, read it here first while sailing to Rome.
[time=1427] The Roman ship carrying Paul has been run aground by a storm.
[time=1429] All are shipwrecks.
[time=1430] Extra extra read all about it.
[time=1432] Paul and his captors escaped the island and ride in Rome.
[time=1435] Paul is in prison awaiting his trial with Caesar.
[time=1437] And so it went.
[time=1438] Yet all throughout Paul's trials, he continued to tell people about Jesus and what had happened to him on the road to Damascus.
[time=1444] Paul was in prison awaiting his trial for over two years.
[time=1449] Howdy folks.
[time=1451] Emperor Caesar here.
[time=1453] Got a little guy out back named Paul.
[time=1456] Probably out of a range, a little meeting.
[time=1457] But I just don't think it would be prudent at this juncture no, no, I just wouldn't be prudent.
[time=1462] And during this time, people still continue to persecute the Christian churches.
[time=1467] Things were often tough and it would have been very easy for them to give up.
[time=1471] Oh, Ockimid.
[time=1474] What's wrong, Ariana Stein?
[time=1475] Oh, Ockimid, what isn't wrong?
[time=1477] Paul's in prison.
[time=1478] Oh, that's right.
[time=1480] And you know, even though our church is growing, everyone hates us.
[time=1483] Do you think that's because we have so much spirit?
[time=1486] No, it's because we're Christians.
[time=1489] Oh, well, gee, I hope the churches don't give up.
[time=1492] You know what they need?
[time=1494] The perfect cheer.
[time=1496] Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[time=1498] Who's the Christian who's the best?
[time=1500] It's Paul, it's Paul.
[time=1502] I said, who's the Christian who's the best?
[time=1504] It's Paul, it's Paul.
[time=1505] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[time=1508] Don't worry, Paul, you'll get out of prison soon.
[time=1510] And when you do, you can play Scrabble at my house.
[time=1513] Woo!
[time=1518] They hate you, churches, but don't you fear it, 'cause you're the ones with the Holy Spirit.
[time=1523] Woo!
[time=1525] Romans, rule, Christians, rule!
[time=1528] In spite of the opposition, the churches continue to grow and spread.
[time=1537] While Paul was imprisoned in Rome, he continued to send letters to the different churches, teaching them and encouraging them.
[time=1544] To make a long story short.
[time=1545] To make the message continue to spread to the ends of the earth.
[time=1549] Scene seven, revelation.
[time=1552] Or it ain't over till it's over.
[time=1555] Sometime around 95 AD, John, the same John, he was one of the original 12 disciples, was condemned to an island called Patmos.
[time=1563] Well, during this time, Jesus appeared to John and gave him a vision of what was going to happen in the future.
[time=1568] Now, a lot of what John wrote was kind of confusing.
[time=1571] And I saw four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes in front and in back, huh?
[time=1578] And I saw the lamb open the third seal, and I saw a black horse, and its rider was carrying a pair of scales.
[time=1588] What's up with that?
[time=1590] And then the fifth angel sounded its trumpet, and I saw the star that had fallen from the sky to the earth was given the key to the abyss.
[time=1597] What's that supposed to mean?
[time=1600] Like I said, a lot of what John wrote is kind of confusing, but this much is clear.
[time=1605] Jesus is coming back someday.
[time=1608] And when he does, he's going to snap Satan like a twig.
[time=1611] All wrongs will be made right.
[time=1613] There will be no more pain, no more suffering, and no more tears.
[time=1617] And those that are called his followers will live with him forever.
[time=1621] But until then, it's up to his followers to spread the message about Jesus.
[time=1624] In Jerusalem?
[time=1625] In Judea.
[time=1626] In Samaria.
[time=1627] And to the ends of the earth.
[time=1628] The story ain't over till Jesus comes back.
[time=1632] Come, Lord Jesus.
[time=1634] The story ain't over till it's over.
[time=1636] Hey, if you brought your Bibles, why don't you open them up to 1 John?
[time=1654] I think we'll be done with 1 John inside two and a half years.
[time=1658] But it has been a few months.
[time=1661] And I hope it's been encouraging.
[time=1663] I hope it's been helpful.
[time=1665] I hope it has been for you a weekly opportunity to do and to extra ought to do what I've been able to do with it.
[time=1673] I know to be able to think about the reality of my own faith, the opportunity that John, and as he writes this letter again, he writes this letter to a church that was in trouble.
[time=1683] He writes this letter to people who were struggling.
[time=1685] The church and those that comprise the church, they had found themselves in the midst of false teaching that had permeated that culture, that believing culture.
[time=1696] The gospel had been dented, so to speak.
[time=1700] All of a sudden there were those in the church thinking things and carrying with them certain thoughts and now possessing certain ideas about doctrine and salvation that were not at all what God had intended.
[time=1712] And so he writes so that people could in that day and so that you and I can in this day have a clear understanding
[time=1721] of what it means and looks like to know him, to be a follower of Christ, to be able to assess with the Spirit of God and the Word of God as our helper the validity and the genuineness of our faith.
[time=1736] And that has been an extremely fruitful endeavor.
[time=1741] I know for me and as I've heard from so many of you and as we continue to get letters and emails from those in the viewing audience, I just want to say thanks for the encouragement that you've brought.
[time=1752] And I can't wait for us to continue to make our way through the book and we come this morning to chapter four and let me just kind of come at it this way, if I can, this morning with the time that we've got left.
[time=1764] Very important that you hear and very important that we understand just the basic foundational approach that John takes here in chapter four, especially from verse seven on.
[time=1777] And here's how all, here's how all, here's how I'll say it to you.
[time=1781] In our home, as Deborah and I do our very best with God's help
[time=1788] and believe me, we need it as I know most of you do as well.
[time=1793] As we're trying to, you know, raise a family.
[time=1796] As we're trying to invest in five kids.
[time=1798] And as we're trying our best to do that with his help in a way that would honor him, there are some things that we've just over 15 years now of parenting.
[time=1809] There are some things, I guess, that we've just decided.
[time=1813] We've just, I shouldn't say we've decided.
[time=1815] There are some things that we've found in here about parenting that we've just in our own hearts,
[time=1823] we've just said, you know what, we're just, we're probably going to miss some things here and there.
[time=1827] We're probably going to let some things go here and there, but there are just some things that we're not going to miss.
[time=1834] There are some things we're not going to let go.
[time=1836] There are some things that we are going to do our very best with his help to put our arms around and give ourselves to completely.
[time=1845] I'm that, you know, and that's a, that's a decent list.
[time=1848] One of those things, one of those things would be something that we just call and we've talked about it in here before.
[time=1854] And many of you are devoted to the very same thing.
[time=1858] And we're trying our best with this thing that we call first time obedience.
[time=1863] Not second time, not fourth time, not fifth time,
[time=1869] not seventh time, but first time obedience.
[time=1874] When a mother asks you to do something, when your father asks you to do something, when a coach asks you to do something, when a teacher asks you to do something, when anybody in authority asks you to do something, you do it the first time.
[time=1890] We've talked about it before in here.
[time=1893] It's to be immediate, it's to be thorough, and it's to be done with a great attitude.
[time=1900] Because that's what God's word says obedience is to be like.
[time=1904] And so I'm just telling you this because in our home, you know, you know, two, three, sometimes four times a month, somebody's, somebody's getting that talk.
[time=1917] Somebody's hearing that message.
[time=1918] Somebody's hearing that principle communicated, and we communicate it, and we try to get through, you know, with it, and we try again, and again, and again, and again, because now even the older we get, the more we realize.
[time=1935] I mean, you thought I believed that at 30?
[time=1937] I'll be 45 in a week.
[time=1940] And I'll tell you what, the older I get, and the more I see the consequences of disobedience,
[time=1950] the more passionate I become, and I try not to overdo it,
[time=1956] but the more passionate I become with my kids about the value of doing what you're asked to do, and doing it because God works through the authorities in our life, and the great value and benefit, and the pain that can be avoided when you do what you've been asked to do the first time.
[time=1977] So my kids, they hear it again and again and again, and they're not perfect at it.
[time=1982] They still need help.
[time=1984] I still need your help to help me help them.
[time=1986] They're still sinful just like you.
[time=1989] We're still working at it, but they hear it again and again.
[time=1992] Why?
[time=1993] Why do I give them that talk again and again and again and again?
[time=1997] Because it matters.
[time=2001] Because it's that important.
[time=2002] And what I want you to see is that in chapter four, from verse seven on, the entire chapter is about love.
[time=2012] And you say, "Well, wait a minute.
[time=2016] I've been with you on this study of 1st John, Kelly, and you've been from chapter one on talking about these tests.
[time=2023] And if I'm not mistaken, Kelly, if you're telling me chapter four is all about love, then this is the third time he's come back to this test of love."
[time=2034] Guess what?
[time=2035] You're right.
[time=2037] And why does he come back again and again and again to this test of love?
[time=2044] Because it matters.
[time=2047] Because it's that important that you and I understand.
[time=2053] It was that important that the church there in that Ephesus region, it was that important.
[time=2058] You know what?
[time=2058] They had one way you could look at it is that they had strayed that far.
[time=2062] The heresy had gotten in that deep.
[time=2065] They had become so unloving.
[time=2067] They had so strayed from God's design for a people who would genuinely love him and thoroughly love each other.
[time=2076] That now he comes back to it, this test of love.
[time=2078] And every time he's come back to it in our study, he has given you and I just a little bit more, just a little bit more the next time to help further explain and paint this picture of what it looks like for you and I to be a loving people.
[time=2093] Christ followers who love God and love others.
[time=2097] And here in this third pass at this thing, he gives us some amazing things I think to consider.
[time=2105] No time to get into each and every one of them, but I want to just show you a couple things.
[time=2110] I want you to start with me if you would at verse nine.
[time=2113] First John chapter four, verse nine.
[time=2119] This sounds very similar to what we heard back in chapter three.
[time=2123] First John four, nine says, by this the love of God was manifested in us.
[time=2130] By this the love of God was manifested in us that God has sent his only begotten son into the world so that we might live through him.
[time=2143] Love was defined last week in chapter three, verse 16.
[time=2148] Just go back a page or so.
[time=2150] We defined love.
[time=2152] God's word defined in a foundational overarching sense.
[time=2156] This great truth, this great principle of love in three, 16.
[time=2160] Love was defined as sacrifice.
[time=2162] I told you that last week you cannot have a discussion about love.
[time=2167] You cannot be a people who want to learn about love.
[time=2170] You cannot assess the presence of or the lack of love in your life
[time=2176] without asking the sacrifice question, because three, 16 defines it for us.
[time=2182] We know love by this that he laid down his life for us.
[time=2188] And we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren, for each other.
[time=2197] Now in very similar language, one way you can look at it is when you look at first John three, 16, this is the definition of love.
[time=2204] And it's brought to us from Christ's perspective.
[time=2208] He laid down his life for us.
[time=2210] Now in four, nine, it's great.
[time=2212] We have the definition of love.
[time=2214] I think just further defined, and now we have it from God, the father's perspective.
[time=2219] By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent his son, his only begotten son into the world.
[time=2227] So that we might live through him.
[time=2230] Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, wherever you find love, you find it.
[time=2236] Look at verse 10, just more great truth and more great pictures painted
[time=2243] from the word of God here about love.
[time=2247] In this, verse 10, in this is love.
[time=2250] Kind of grabs your attention.
[time=2253] You want to see love, you want to understand love, you want a picture of love in this is love.
[time=2259] Not that we love God, but that he loved who, but that he loved us and sent his son to be the big word there.
[time=2268] You see it?
[time=2269] The propitiation for our sins.
[time=2276] We've talked about that word in the past.
[time=2278] Many of you may remember our discussion about it.
[time=2281] Others of you may be new to this discussion.
[time=2283] Propitiation, big word, huge meaning, enormous implications that Jesus came
[time=2294] and was the propitiation for your sin.
[time=2297] Here's the deal, my friends.
[time=2299] The presence of a holy God.
[time=2302] The presence of a majestic and awesome God.
[time=2305] The presence of a sinless, pure, holy God.
[time=2309] And the presence of sin, sin making its way into his presence.
[time=2314] Sin making its way into the realm of this world.
[time=2318] The presence of sin in conjunction with a holy, pure and righteous God demands.
[time=2324] Not because it's unfair, not because it's mean, not because it's anything like that, but just the sheer reality of that.
[time=2334] Holy, righteous God, sinfulness, that equation demands that the sin be judged.
[time=2341] The sin has got to be dealt with.
[time=2345] The holy, righteous and pure God must deliver judgment on the sin,
[time=2351] because sin and a holy God are incompatible.
[time=2354] It doesn't work.
[time=2358] So that's where you and I were in trouble.
[time=2363] That's where mankind was absolutely hosed.
[time=2366] That's where, at that point, there was no good ending, because your sinfulness
[time=2373] and my sinfulness and the sinfulness of every person who has ever walked the face of this earth in comparison to the holiness and purity of a righteous God left us without hope.
[time=2384] But God, being rich in mercy, Ephesians 2, but God, because of his great love for you, John 3, 16,
[time=2394] for God so loved you that he gave his only who, son.
[time=2399] The ultimate supreme sacrificial act of love and the son, Jesus Christ,
[time=2406] back to the word propitiation, he receives the punishment.
[time=2411] He receives the judgment. He endures all of God's wrath.
[time=2417] His wrath against sin, and in doing so is the propitiation.
[time=2424] He satisfies the demand of God's wrath.
[time=2428] A very severe judgment must be brought against sin, and Christ took every bit of it because of his great love.
[time=2440] His great love for you and his great love for me.
[time=2442] So much more we could see there in chapter 4.
[time=2446] Let me draw your attention if I could, verse 21.
[time=2448] If you were going to take all that he says here in this third treatment now of love, he's so committed to you and I, understanding what it means, and how important it is as we live out this faith that we, in the every day of our life,
[time=2464] practice this principle of loving God and loving others.
[time=2467] He comes back at it now for a third time.
[time=2469] And if you were going to summarize all of what he says here in four, I'd take you two and many of the commentators and scholars would take you to 21, the last verse.
[time=2479] And would you look at that with me this morning and this commandment we have from him, and this commandment we have from him, that one, that the one who loves God.
[time=2489] Raise your hand if you love God.
[time=2495] Okay, if you love God, then the scripture says you should love your brother as well.
[time=2502] And your brother, my friends, for the sake of this discussion and the use of the word here in this text, my friends, your brother, your brother is right there.
[time=2513] So your brother is right here.
[time=2518] You two, your brothers, you over here in me were brothers.
[time=2525] See, the brother here is the brethren.
[time=2528] The brother here is each other.
[time=2533] Those of us that together raise our hands and say we love God.
[time=2536] That love for God is to be evidenced by this extreme, this passionate, this unending,
[time=2542] this unstoppable, this unbelievable devotion to each other.
[time=2549] I love for God and I love for others. As I read through this verse and as I thought about it this
[time=2555] week and as I've looked at it over the years, I've just kept some of the quotes that I've found.
[time=2560] I've just put aside some of the writings that I've seen over time and I've just, I've got them down for you this morning. I want you to think about these things with me.
[time=2568] Just application, thoughts, and a chance for you and I to give some real, some real consideration to the truth of 421.
[time=2576] And this commandment we have from him that the one who loves God should love his brother also.
[time=2582] The one who truly loves God, look at the screen, the one who truly loves God will be known for
[time=2588] keyword there, known for truly loving those in the church. Yes, our love is to extend beyond these
[time=2596] walls. We've talked about that at length. So we are not dismissing that concept at all.
[time=2602] But in this context, it is so important that you understand that you should literally have a reputation.
[time=2609] What's your reputation? What are you known for? What characterizes you? As you live life within
[time=2620] the body of Christ, you should be known for. You should have a reputation. Some folks say, well,
[time=2626] it's not my gift. Some folks say, it's not my personality. Some folks want to talk about gift
[time=2634] mixes and personalities. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's like those who say they don't want to clap on a Sunday. God's word says clap. You clap. God's word says love. You love. You may have a,
[time=2645] you may have a little bit, your personality type may be a little bit more of this.
[time=2650] You know, your gift mix may be a little bit more of this, but you know what God's word says that
[time=2656] when you and I come into a fully surrendered relationship with Him, the love of God fills us,
[time=2662] and we, no matter our personality type or gift, we will be loving towards those in the family.
[time=2671] We will be known for those who truly love God will be known for truly loving those in the church.
[time=2678] Write this one down. You're only as godly, or you could write down mature, or you could write down spiritual. Write this down. You're only as godly as your worst relationship.
[time=2688] So many times I think people want to associate other endeavors with godliness. They think if they
[time=2696] know a lot, they're godly. They think if they acquire a lot of biblical wisdom, they're godly.
[time=2702] They think if they can rattle off answers to theological questions that they're godly, and the fact of the matter is the great truth of the gospel, the great truth of the Christian life is that godliness, according to this, has much more to do about the way in which you love
[time=2719] than the amount in which you know. And I don't want to in any way diminish knowing.
[time=2726] Look at 1 Timothy 3, for instance. Just go real quick to 1 Timothy 3, if you will.
[time=2734] In 1 Timothy 3, some of you may know, just as I say that, that you find in 1 Timothy 3 the qualifications
[time=2742] of an elder. I don't think anybody in the room would argue with the fact that we would want our
[time=2748] elders to be godly. We would want our elders to be spiritually mature. Well, an overseer, verse 2, then must be above reproach. Does above reproach have mainly to do with the acquisition of knowledge
[time=2760] or the presence of relational integrity? The husband of one wife, knowledge, relational integrity.
[time=2772] Temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, again and again and again as you make your way
[time=2782] through this list of qualifications, what you see fundamentally is a man whose love for God has spilled over into a love for others. Able to teach that one right there may be one in that mix that has a great bit to do with the acquisition of knowledge and the ability to do
[time=2799] something not addicted to wine, pugnacious, gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money. He must
[time=2807] be one who manages his own household while keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=2813] Everywhere you look, you see this enormous emphasis given to the willingness and the
[time=2824] readiness of God's people to love. Go to Galatians 5, put elders aside. Let's not talk about elders,
[time=2830] let's just talk about you. Let's just talk about the everyday Christ follower who fully surrenders his heart and life, her heart and life to Christ and as the Spirit of God indwells,
[time=2841] Galatians 5 gives us some signs, gives us some evidences that the Spirit of God really truly is
[time=2848] at work in a person. And how do we see the Spirit of God really truly at work in a person? You know
[time=2856] what you see? Relational, loving, relational integrity. Look at verse 22, but the fruit of
[time=2864] the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control,
[time=2877] all of these things having to do with your willingness in mind to submit to God in the way in which we
[time=2884] would love, treat, come alongside, interact with others. You and I are to be loving toward each other.
[time=2892] Next quote, you can write this down, there is no place among, I've got this from an old commentary
[time=2899] in my office, there is no place among the brethren for the harsh, the critical or the mean-spirited,
[time=2905] no place, there is no place in this room, there's no place in this family as it relates to our
[time=2911] relationships with each other, no place at all for the harsh, the critical or the mean-spirited,
[time=2917] Christ followers stop at nothing to offer in word and deed. There's some first John 3 language
[time=2923] from last week, Christ followers stop at nothing to offer in word and deed, acceptance, kindness
[time=2929] and grace to each other. Love permeates the family of God. We are known for our acceptance,
[time=2936] our kindness and grace toward each other. The next one says in God's design, there is no room,
[time=2942] I love this, in God's design there is no room for relational factions, divisions or desertions.
[time=2950] Ever think of it that way? Those who engage in relational desertion,
[time=2957] I'm out of here, I'm done with you.
[time=2962] There are times, there are times, I always need to say this in moments like this because there
[time=2972] are always some who need help walking through unique situations and there are unique circumstances
[time=2979] that at times call for us to come alongside you and help you take steps backwards but as it relates
[time=2985] to the general relationship that we have with each other. In God's design, there's no room for
[time=2992] relational factions, divisions or desertions in the church. Gracious, look at it, gracious,
[time=2998] patient love is to be the norm and peace is to be pursued at all costs. I asked first hour, I asked
[time=3007] them, I said it this way to first hour, I wonder what kind of a list you'd come up with if you
[time=3013] listed in your mind right now or you wrote down today the list of people you used to love, the list of people that you used to like,
[time=3023] the list of names of individuals that you used to hang with, you at one point in time you were
[time=3035] gracious and kind and patient toward them but not anymore. No, now you've left and for the one here
[time=3045] this morning, I just wrote this one down and for the one here this morning who at this very moment is saying, boy, I hope he's paying attention because there are those of you in the room and
[time=3056] you're sitting here thinking right now, yeah, I left, yeah, I walked away and I hope they're listening
[time=3064] because they need to make it right. Well, to you in the room who might be thinking that, I would
[time=3070] just offer to you Romans 1218 and we've looked at this before. Some of you know it without me
[time=3076] even turning their others, if you maybe it's a new learning for you this morning, Romans 1218,
[time=3082] if possible it says, so far as it depends on who, say it out loud, you. In other words,
[time=3092] we should all be saying right now, me. Everybody say me. If possible, so far as it depends on me,
[time=3100] right? Be at what? Be at peace. If possible and you might quickly raise your hand and say,
[time=3111] well, it's impossible and I would quickly come back at you and say, really, let's talk about that.
[time=3117] Tell me how it's impossible for you to take a step toward peace with one where there has been a
[time=3125] relational division. If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with how many men,
[time=3135] all men with all men. What an amazing truth. This verse puts them, the beginning. Listen,
[time=3144] this verse puts the beginning of division resolution, the beginning of division
[time=3155] restoration. It puts the beginning of that process completely on you, completely on you, complete restoration, I know, and God knows. God's very aware of the fact that
[time=3168] complete relational restoration cannot occur without both parties completely giving themselves,
[time=3175] but you can what? You can start it. You can be persistent in it. You can step out first and you
[time=3186] can stay out in that vulnerable place of offering yourself because back to the meaning of the morning, back to the whole point of the discussion because that's what love does. Love puts itself out
[time=3199] in a very vulnerable place and as far as it depends on you, if you have any opportunity to do it,
[time=3206] if you have any circumstance within which you can offer it, if there is any chance that you have to say what needs to be said, to write the note that needs to be written, to send the email, to have coffee, to do dinner, to be one who moves back toward relational integrity instead
[time=3223] of relational division. In the body of Christ, it says in 1 John that if we love him, we will love
[time=3230] the brethren. John reminds us again, third time, he says it's that important and so I would encourage
[time=3242] you, young people, moms and dads, single adult, senior adult, I don't care who you are,
[time=3250] you've known the Lord and are trying your best to follow him for a few months now, you've known him and you're doing your best to follow him after 50 years, whoever you are, he says that list of those that we used to love, that list of those that we used to lie. I understand
[time=3267] sometimes relationships change and we don't spend as much time. I'm with you on that. I understand that. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about division. I'm talking about I don't like him.
[time=3275] I'm talking about we don't like them and in this place, the degree to which that is present
[time=3283] kills us because it says they will know us by our what? By our what? Our love, our love. And John
[time=3292] reiterates that very truth right here. Test of love, part three, give it some thought. Would you
[time=3298] stand? Let me pray for us this morning as we go. Father, God, what a privilege it has been and
[time=3307] what a joy for many of us in the room this morning to be able to be here in your presence with the body of Christ gathered to worship you, gathered God to look again into the life-changing
[time=3320] eternity-altering truth of your word. And God, as it encourages us again, as we've been
[time=3328] lovingly sat down again and told the same thing again by one who loves us deeply. God,
[time=3335] I pray that we would listen. God, I pray that you give us the strength to apply this truth. Oh,
[time=3341] God, I pray that we would seize and take hold of every opportunity you give us this week to love
[time=3349] each other. Seriously, to write that note, to have a hallway conversation this morning to get across
[time=3358] the room today before he or she leaves. God, to stop at nothing, to exercise and extend grace,
[time=3365] acceptance, love, patience, kindness. God, I pray that we would do that and that God in doing that,
[time=3372] in loving each other that way. Oh, God, that an on-looking world would see and sense something
[time=3379] drastically different and unique about us. God, may we be encouraged this morning to continue
[time=3388] this week in our reading, in our fasting, in our giving that we'll be able to do now as we leave
[time=3395] this morning. God, may you use these endeavors and these disciplines again, God, to prepare us
[time=3401] for the great celebration of the resurrection. May we be mindful each and every moment of each
[time=3408] and every day, God, of the great sacrifice of your Son and the life and the hope that it has brought.
[time=3415] Father, God, we thank you for the privilege of being able to be here today. What we've been able
[time=3421] to sing, what we've been able to watch, what we've been able to take in, God, from your word. It
[time=3427] reminds us of how great and awesome and mighty and powerful and loving and sacrificial and sovereign
[time=3435] you are. It reminds us of how obedient your Son was and how willing he was to give away
[time=3443] his life so that we could have one. And please know, God, there are so many of us in this room
[time=3449] that are eternally grateful for your willingness to give him. And oh, Lord Jesus Christ, your willingness
[time=3455] to obey the Father the first time and to obey him completely and to obey him with the peace,
[time=3464] the peace that you evidenced, that peace that surpasses all comprehension. Father, we love you.
[time=3471] Please fill us with your strength and courage as we leave this place together collectively. We thank you for the privilege that is ours of knowing you and walking with you and all the people in the room agreed and said amen.
