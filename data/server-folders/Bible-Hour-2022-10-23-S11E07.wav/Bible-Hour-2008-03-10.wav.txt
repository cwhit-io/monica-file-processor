[time=99] Last week we learned this song.
[time=101] It just declares and cries out, "Hosanna." And we want to declare that this morning on this poem, "Sunde hosanna means God through saves." So as we sing that song, we're crying out to a God of salvation, and we're praising Him together this morning.
[time=117] Oh praise is rising, eyes are turning to you.
[time=129] We turn to you.
[time=135] Oh, bistering hearts are turning for you.
[time=144] We long for you, we long for you.
[time=150] 'Cause when we see you, we find strength to face the day.
[time=159] In your presence, all our fears are washed away.
[time=165] Washed away.
[time=168] Hosanna!
[time=176] You by the God who saves us.
[time=180] When a young old God brings in, Hosanna!
[time=189] Hosanna!
[time=193] Come out your way among us.
[time=197] Welcome your dear Lord Jesus.
[time=204] Oh hear the sound of God.
[time=209] Heart and sweet turning to you.
[time=216] We turn to you.
[time=221] In your kingdom, broken lives are made new.
[time=231] You make a sniff, you make a sniff.
[time=237] 'Cause when we see you, we find strength to face the day.
[time=245] In your presence, all our fears are washed away.
[time=252] Hosanna!
[time=264] You by the God who saves us.
[time=273] Hosanna!
[time=284] Come out your way among us.
[time=289] Welcome your dear Lord Jesus.
[time=303] â™ª
[time=313] 'Cause when we see you, 'cause when we see you, we find strength to face the day.
[time=323] And in your presence, all our fears are washed away.
[time=329] 'Cause when we see you, 'cause when we see you, we find strength to face the day.
[time=340] In your presence, all our fears are washed away.
[time=346] 'Cause when we see you, 'cause when we see you, we find strength to face the day.
[time=368] Hosanna!
[time=376] Come out your way among us.
[time=380] Welcome your dear Lord Jesus.
[time=385] Hosanna!
[time=393] You by the God who saves us.
[time=397] It's worthy of all our praises.
[time=401] We sing, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=415] Come out your way among us.
[time=419] We welcome your dear Lord Jesus.
[time=425] We sing, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=445] Well, good morning everybody.
[time=453] It's so great to have you here with us on the broadcast.
[time=456] As most of you watch this this morning, it is March 23rd.
[time=461] And it is the most significant and most special morning of all in the life of a Christ follower.
[time=468] And I want to just say to you, happy Easter, happy Resurrection Sunday.
[time=472] I know many of you watch the broadcast before you get ready and go to your own local church.
[time=478] I've told you hundreds of times in the past how thankful we are that you're a part of those churches giving yourselves to those people in that ministry.
[time=487] I know that others of you though don't have a place that you call home.
[time=491] In fact, many of you call this broadcast home.
[time=494] For many of you, this relationship that we have, this opportunity we get week after week is for you a chance to connect.
[time=501] And I want to just invite you this morning.
[time=503] I know it's that morning and we're having services this morning and a half an hour, nine o'clock and then ten forty-five.
[time=509] I want to invite you this morning to come and to join us this morning at Blackhawk
[time=515] for Easter Celebration and the chance to make much of a God who gave his son
[time=521] so you and I could have life.
[time=523] I want to just tell you that there's three responses.
[time=527] And we're going to talk about this this morning.
[time=529] I just want to tell you I'll give you a preview right here.
[time=531] Three responses to the resurrection story that I think are consistent
[time=537] with people all over the world.
[time=539] We see these responses in the scriptures.
[time=541] Number one there was Peter and Peter's response was elation.
[time=545] Peter's response was absolute utter joy as he runs as he sprints to the empty tomb.
[time=552] There was a guy named Thomas who was also a disciple.
[time=555] And Thomas' response when he hears about the resurrection is doubt.
[time=561] He's not so sure about it.
[time=563] He's not so convinced that it actually happened.
[time=567] He understands the implications of it would be huge but he's just not quite there yet.
[time=573] Just can't grasp it.
[time=575] And then there's the centurion soldier.
[time=578] This isn't so much in response to the resurrection but the crucifixion.
[time=582] But still the centurion soldier who had been there actually participating in the murder
[time=588] and torture of Jesus.
[time=590] It says there in the gospels that at a certain moment as Jesus hung him across dying the centurion realized.
[time=598] He realized what he had done.
[time=600] He realized that Jesus was the Christ.
[time=603] He realizes that they had just killed the Messiah and that realization leads him to a repentant heart.
[time=611] Elation, doubt and realization.
[time=615] And I bet most of you watching this morning have one of those responses to the great truth of this great day.
[time=623] And I hope you'll come.
[time=625] I hope you'll get in your car this morning.
[time=627] You might want to get dressed and showered up and brush your teeth and all that.
[time=631] But come and be with us on this most special of Sundays, 9 o'clock in 1045.
[time=636] I hope you'll come if you do make sure you come down and say hello.
[time=640] We'd love to meet you and put a name with a face.
[time=642] God bless you on this greatest of all days and we hope to see you real, real soon.
[time=648] God bless.
[time=670] God bless you on this greatest of all days and we hope to meet you.
[time=1105] Think about some things that are absolute and let's just for the sake of the beginning of the discussion.
[time=1111] Let's just stay in the physical realm if we can.
[time=1114] Let me invite you to think of some things in the physical realm in the human realm that are absolute.
[time=1122] By absolute I mean no brainers, no doubters, something or someone that is in who they are or what they do always
[time=1130] and without fail constant and uninterrupted.
[time=1135] What are the foreshores in your world?
[time=1139] No ifs, ands, or buts, right?
[time=1141] This thing, this person, this involvement here, this is always a given.
[time=1146] It's incapable of letting you down.
[time=1149] Never a glitch, always consistent, always dependable, never failing, guaranteed, absolute.
[time=1158] What comes to your mind?
[time=1162] I think about some of the people I know who do certain things and I would want them to be absolute, never failing, always consistent.
[time=1174] But you know, I'll let you decide.
[time=1176] Let's just throw out a few here.
[time=1177] I got a few friends in this church family who are male carriers.
[time=1182] I love these guys.
[time=1183] They do a great job.
[time=1184] The percentages are really high, right?
[time=1187] But are they absolute?
[time=1188] Yes or no?
[time=1189] No, every once in a while there's a little glitch.
[time=1192] I got a good friend of mine who's a weatherman here in town at a local ABC affiliate.
[time=1198] I don't even know if he's here today, but he's a good guy and he tries really, really, really hard.
[time=1205] He's even got this cool technology, pinpoint something.
[time=1210] And he's like, I bet if you graded him, I certainly know this.
[time=1213] If we graded him against the other weathermen or weatherwomen, I mean, he'd be way at the top, right, amen?
[time=1219] All right.
[time=1223] But I tell you what, I tell you what, he is not absolutely is he.
[time=1229] Is he?
[time=1230] All right, thank you.
[time=1235] Oh my goodness.
[time=1237] Absolute, never failing, always there, count on it, guaranteed.
[time=1243] I think about IU Purdue winning a first round big ten tournament game.
[time=1247] Not going to happen there.
[time=1248] We're still looking for something absolute.
[time=1252] What about a friend?
[time=1255] You got some good ones I bet.
[time=1257] So do I.
[time=1258] Absolute?
[time=1260] No.
[time=1262] Marriage.
[time=1264] Don't go there, man.
[time=1269] Marriage, wealth, earnings.
[time=1275] How about health and long life?
[time=1279] Guaranteed?
[time=1281] Absolute?
[time=1283] Happiness?
[time=1285] Constant?
[time=1287] Never ending?
[time=1288] For in the physical realm, yes or no?
[time=1297] No.
[time=1298] Peace.
[time=1299] But, but you move this discussion from the physical into the spiritual.
[time=1302] You move this discussion from people into the realm of God and that which he has offered you and I.
[time=1310] You move this conversation about absolutes into his realm and my friends we have, Steve and I have some very, very good news for you this morning.
[time=1318] And we can't wait to bring you from this passage in 1 John 5.
[time=1322] Five absolutes in the Christian life.
[time=1326] John, in his effort to kind of bring closure to this epistle as he writes here, delivers five absolutes that every believer should not only be aware of but be experiencing the joy that comes with you.
[time=1339] The joy that comes with them in the everyday of his and her life.
[time=1343] Five absolutes, we want you to be absolutely sure of as you and I leave this place today and as we, those of us that know him, those of us in the room that have fully surrendered our hearts and lives to him.
[time=1357] These are principles, my friends.
[time=1359] These are truths that you and I can't count on.
[time=1363] Absolutely.
[time=1365] Let me pray and Steve's going to get us going.
[time=1368] God, thank you for this morning, we don't take it for granted.
[time=1371] God, we realize that our freedom and the ability that we have God to gather here in this room is something that so many in this world right now today in this moment don't have.
[time=1382] And so, God, we sit in this room, we sit humbly and expectantly before you and we thank you, God, that we can do this and we hope, God, that you will teach us.
[time=1394] And it was reminded this week by a friend that this may be for some in this room, the only touch, the only opportunity.
[time=1401] Maybe for some in this room this morning, this right here in this moment, God, is the first chance they've had all week to hear from you.
[time=1409] And, oh, God, may Steve and I not get in the way.
[time=1413] And may your words speak powerfully to those who would need to hear from you.
[time=1418] And God, for those in the room that know you, may these absolutes about our faith, God, may they renew our spirits, may these absolutes encourage us again to a better view and walk with you.
[time=1433] Oh, God, thank you for your Scripture, for what it means and for what it does and may it do today because of your strength.
[time=1440] God, it's mighty work in us.
[time=1442] In your son's name we pray.
[time=1444] [AMEN] Absolute number one, Steve, take it away.
[time=1447] Eternal life.
[time=1450] We can experience eternal life and believe and understand that it's absolute in Christ.
[time=1465] And we'll look at how we can do that even in this first verse that we're looking at here verse 13.
[time=1470] It says, "These things, most likely referring to the preceding verses, maybe the whole epistle."
[time=1479] We don't know for sure what he's really referring to there, but these things, if he's referring to the preceding verses that we looked at last week, at least 11 and 12 saying, "The witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
[time=1495] He who has the Son has the life, he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life." Verse 13 then says, "These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God in order that you may know that you have eternal life."
[time=1513] Well, we can know it.
[time=1516] We can be certain of it.
[time=1518] It's an absolute that he's given us eternal life in Christ.
[time=1524] It says, "I have written to you who believe."
[time=1531] So what if you believe this morning?
[time=1533] If you believe in the Son of God, if you believe in the name of the Son of God, then you can know you have eternal life.
[time=1542] What's the name have to do with this?
[time=1545] Well, name, it's a great word in the New Testament.
[time=1548] That word name really doesn't mean that somebody's name so I know just physically who they are.
[time=1555] This word name means it's used for everything which name can cover.
[time=1560] Everything the thought or feeling of which is aroused in your mind by mentioning, hearing, remembering the name of someone.
[time=1567] It might mean their rank, their authority, their interests, their pleasure, their command, their excellences, their deeds.
[time=1573] It's everything about it.
[time=1575] So in the person of who he is, we can know we have eternal life.
[time=1581] It's interesting too in this particular verse.
[time=1583] There are a couple of words for know that are different but are both translated know here in the NASB.
[time=1588] The first know shows up and it says, "These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, nor that you may know that you have eternal life.
[time=1595] These things I have written to you who believe that you may know." What's that know?
[time=1598] The first one here in verse 13 is a word for belonging to a house or a family having intimate knowledge of
[time=1610] because you're in a domestic arena with these people.
[time=1614] You know them well.
[time=1615] So those of us that have been adopted into his family may know that we have eternal life.
[time=1619] That's what this is saying.
[time=1620] Here's an illustration for eternal life that I love.
[time=1623] Years ago I started thinking about how to describe the brevity of life.
[time=1628] And many students that I had in government or Bible class, even Sunday school classes here as we did ABS, I was thinking of how to illustrate brevity.
[time=1636] And so I'd talk about the fact that eternity can be represented physically and visually by looking at a line.
[time=1647] A line can represent eternity.
[time=1649] A line has no beginning.
[time=1650] It goes on forever that way.
[time=1652] And it has no end.
[time=1653] It goes on forever that way.
[time=1656] And so if eternity is a line, I would say in order to illustrate the brevity of life, let's put the beginning of our physical existence on the eternal line of life.
[time=1667] And so we'd go up on the chalkboard and somebody'd put a dot, the smallest possible dot you could make with a chalk,
[time=1674] and they'd put it on there and say that's the beginning of each of our lives.
[time=1678] And then I said, somebody come up and represent the length of your life on that eternal line.
[time=1686] We got the dot going, somehow it's the beginning, the point.
[time=1690] Now how can you put the next point close enough to the beginning point on an eternal line to represent the blip of 70, 80, even 100 years?
[time=1701] Well, they'd come out and start to do it and then they'd realize the chalk was too big.
[time=1708] You can't put a point beside a point that begins a life on an eternal line that's close enough to really express the brevity of our life.
[time=1720] Does that make sense?
[time=1722] Think about it in the other way now.
[time=1724] As a beginning point, a believer, a person who's come to know and trust in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ has a beginning point on him.
[time=1733] He's the eternal life.
[time=1735] We start there with him and then we are then array.
[time=1739] We go on forever, that's what the geometric expression of it is.
[time=1742] We're array, we have a beginning point, but we don't have any ending point with him.
[time=1747] We can know that we have a beginning and no ending in life with him if we know him.
[time=1754] That's what John says.
[time=1756] It's always not good.
[time=1758] And there's a second line too though.
[time=1761] We talked about that first hour.
[time=1763] That first one represents life in him.
[time=1766] The second ray could be drawn that represents eternal death.
[time=1771] If we don't get on, if we're not in Christ in eternal life with him, we have a beginning and we have no end, but it's an eternal death that we're experiencing instead of eternal life.
[time=1788] Absolute, number one in Christ, you and I have eternal, unending life.
[time=1797] Number two, write this down, answered prayer.
[time=1800] Answered prayer, John moves on to this topic of prayer in verse 14.
[time=1805] Look at 1 John chapter 5 verse 14 says, "This is the confidence which we have before him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us."
[time=1816] Verse 15, "And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from him."
[time=1826] My friends, you might want to just write this down if you're taking notes this morning.
[time=1829] This is a fundamental principle.
[time=1832] If you were to ask me to spend time teaching you this morning on some of the foundational or fundamental principles of prayer, I would at the very top of that list give you this one.
[time=1842] Oh, very important that you understand as it relates to your prayer life and mind.
[time=1847] John reminds us of the principle of praying, according, write it down, praying according to the will of God.
[time=1854] Prayers are good.
[time=1856] God calls us to communicate and commune with him.
[time=1859] He longs to hear the desires of your heart.
[time=1862] He longs to hear our adoration and our confession and our thanks and our supplication, but he says all prayer is to be done.
[time=1871] Don't miss this, according to the will of God.
[time=1876] An old scholar said this.
[time=1878] I had him put it up on the screen for you this morning when the prayers that are prayed are prayed in and for the will of God.
[time=1885] When the prayers that are prayed are prayed in and for the will of God, those prayers are always answered because God's will is always what?
[time=1895] Done.
[time=1897] God's will is never not done.
[time=1899] God's will is never not accomplished.
[time=1901] And when the prayers that are prayed are prayed in and for the will of God, those prayers are always answered because God's will is always done.
[time=1911] Prayer is the declaration, someone said, of our personal desires, desires which have been completely relegated, subjugated and submitted to the will of God.
[time=1921] Maybe just in the easiest, simplest way possible, you would just want to say it or write it down this way.
[time=1927] Prayer is not asking for what we want. Prayer is asking for what?
[time=1932] Who? God wants.
[time=1937] That's why Jesus, when teaching us how to pray, most of you realize that Jesus wanted to teach his followers how to pray.
[time=1944] If you go back to the Sermon on the mountain, Matthew 5, 6 and 7, an amazing discourse there, right there in chapter 6, he says to them, "Hey, pray like this, our Father who art in heaven, hallow would be thy name.
[time=1960] Thy kingdom come, say it with me, thy will be done."
[time=1966] Be reminded today, everybody, I believe Scripture is very clear that God longs to hear your, I call them, "Oh, please God, prayers."
[time=1982] You pray them, don't you?
[time=1984] I do. Oh, oh, please God.
[time=1992] At 17 I prayed, "Oh, please God, bring my mom and dad back together."
[time=1998] I begged him, I begged him, "Oh, please, oh, please God, bring my mom and dad back together."
[time=2006] Sometimes we pray, "Oh, please God, would you keep our kids safe?"
[time=2012] Sometimes we pray, "Oh, please God, would you help me find a job?" Sometimes we're praying, "Oh, please God, would you, would you heal him? Oh, please God, would you, would you allow her to live?"
[time=2026] And then I forget 12 years ago, we came here from California and in the early days of just coming to Fort Wayne and me joining this team immediately, you know, in the friendship that began with Steve, we joined in with others, many of you who had known Steve for years
[time=2040] and we were praying, "Oh, please God, would you heal Renee?" Renee was Steve's first wife and she had cancer and had been fighting it for a while and over that next year or so after we got here, all we prayed, "Oh, please God."
[time=2055] But you have to understand that whether it's a sick spouse or a parental breakup or a job or a fractured relationship, what is so very important is that we would be a trusting enough people of him.
[time=2069] To be able and willing to say to him, "On all those, oh, please God, prayers, oh, please God, if say it with me, if it be your will."
[time=2081] Because sometimes it isn't.
[time=2087] Renee went to be with the Lord about 12 years ago.
[time=2092] We began maybe a year or so, I don't know when it was exactly.
[time=2098] Two years or so after that, we began to pray very sincerely and very genuinely, "Oh, please God, if it be your will, bring someone to this guy so we can stop feeding him."
[time=2113] If you bring somebody who he could share life with, if it be your will, God, would you bring somebody?
[time=2121] And he brought Nancy.
[time=2123] Did he ever?
[time=2125] Yeah.
[time=2126] And I want to remind you this morning that this is what John clearly says that you and I are to be willing to with great honesty and great transparency.
[time=2136] And before the Father making our requests in the will, praying that his will be done.
[time=2142] Real quick, write these three things down.
[time=2144] As I studied the Gospel of John this week, and as I looked through the epistle of John, which we've been studying here, first John, all written by the same guy, three things you want to just take note of on prayer.
[time=2154] I think very, very important.
[time=2155] Number one, and I just kind of had them put this under the category of conditions for prayer.
[time=2161] Three conditions of prayer, if you want to understand better what God's word says about prayer, especially from the pen of John, here's three things that you should always keep in mind.
[time=2171] Number one, obedience.
[time=2172] Obedience is a condition for answered prayer.
[time=2176] Obedience is a condition for one's prayer life, one's prayer relationship going well.
[time=2181] Look at first John, we were there just several weeks ago.
[time=2184] Look at first John, 3.22.
[time=2187] It says in first John, 3.22.
[time=2189] It says, and whatever we ask, we receive from him because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing to him.
[time=2201] It's why my friends, it's why confession is so important that when you sin and when I sin, when we've transgressed, when we've fallen short of God's standard, there needs to be this regular activity of confession in our lives so that we're not walking in disobedience
[time=2217] so that our prayers are heard, so that our prayer life and our communication with him is unhindered.
[time=2224] Obedience is a condition for effective prayer.
[time=2228] Second one, right down John 15-7, abiding.
[time=2232] Abiding in Christ is a condition for healthy, the factual prayer.
[time=2238] Here's what it means to abide.
[time=2239] Steve, come here.
[time=2240] Stand right here in the middle.
[time=2241] This is, Steve is the prayer.
[time=2243] Don't squeeze as hard as you did for service.
[time=2245] Steve is the prayer, okay, and just for the sake of the illustration on God, okay?
[time=2252] Here's abiding.
[time=2254] Steve has chosen to put himself in this position right here.
[time=2260] You see where he is?
[time=2262] This is abiding.
[time=2263] Steve is abiding in him.
[time=2267] When Steve willingly, by virtue of the choices of his everyday life, brings himself submissively and willingly into a place with God that's close.
[time=2279] This is abiding.
[time=2282] And when prayers are offered up, when communication with God happens, how you doing?
[time=2287] Good.
[time=2288] All right.
[time=2289] And then when God kind of does this, see, and then, and then when unexpectedly God does this,
[time=2296] see, and Steve stays close.
[time=2298] Some translations call it remaining, and no matter where God comes, there's Steve.
[time=2303] He's just staying right.
[time=2304] How you doing?
[time=2305] I like it.
[time=2306] Right there.
[time=2309] Now when this guy starts praying to God in this posture, how's it going?
[time=2315] It's good.
[time=2317] But if Steve, if God's over here going like this, and there's Steve over there, don't go too far, man.
[time=2325] [laughter] So there, just that picture right there.
[time=2330] How's that going to go?
[time=2332] If it's so very important that in the praying there be abiding and obedience and intimacy, it's not so good.
[time=2342] Obedience is a condition of prayer, 1 John 3, abiding or remaining, John 15, 7, number 3, right this down, praying in Jesus' name.
[time=2350] Sometimes we think, "Oh, come on.
[time=2353] Don't make us be all into repetition and always saying it the same way." No, no, no, no.
[time=2358] Wait, wait, wait.
[time=2359] John 14, 14, very clear that we would pray in Jesus that the prayers that are offered are offered in Jesus' name.
[time=2371] You just think about it.
[time=2372] You think about having access to somebody's, you think about having access to someone important.
[time=2377] It's very, you're very successful and you're attempting to access that person when you know someone's name.
[time=2385] Here is the ultimate of all important people.
[time=2388] And he says, "I will hear your prayers when they are offered in my son's name." Very important for you and I.
[time=2395] And the expression of this.
[time=2396] The expression of that.
[time=2397] It's not the J-E-S-U-S word.
[time=2400] No.
[time=2401] The expression of that word, though, prompts me to be aware of who he is.
[time=2408] That's who I pray in.
[time=2410] I might say Christ.
[time=2414] But it's about being in His name, being in the person of Christ, praying to Him in Him.
[time=2422] Eternal life, absolute number one, answered prayer, absolute number two, victory over sin.
[time=2428] Yeah, you want to have victory over sin.
[time=2430] We have it.
[time=2431] [AMEN] We have it.
[time=2434] He says in verse 18, "We know that no one who is born of God's sins."
[time=2441] That's a troubling phrase.
[time=2443] It may be the translation of that's difficult.
[time=2447] And scholars really do disagree about what that one means.
[time=2450] When I read it in English in the NASB, I think, "Oh, that means I'll never sin again." That's obviously not what it means.
[time=2457] I do.
[time=2458] So what can it mean?
[time=2460] Well, I really liked what a couple different people...one person said that it may really be a phrase representing Christ Himself, the sinless one who was born of God.
[time=2471] It makes it possible for Him to be the person who keeps me from evil.
[time=2480] It may well be that it is about us, but it's about the condition of our sinfulness.
[time=2487] In Christ, we no longer are in a sinful condition.
[time=2494] We don't any longer continue in a sinful life in Christ.
[time=2500] In Christ, sin is an aberration.
[time=2505] It's not something that's normal for us.
[time=2509] It's abnormal for us in Christ to sin.
[time=2513] And it says, it goes on in that verse to say, "We know that no one who is born of God sins,
[time=2519] but He who was born of God keeps Him." That is Christ.
[time=2524] And the evil one does not touch Him.
[time=2526] Keep and touch.
[time=2528] What?
[time=2529] These are great words.
[time=2532] He keeps me.
[time=2536] That word means to attend too carefully.
[time=2540] When I'm abiding in Him...
[time=2542] You want to hug again?
[time=2543] Yeah.
[time=2544] When I'm abiding in Him, He is tending to me carefully.
[time=2549] And He keeps me.
[time=2551] He tends to me.
[time=2553] He takes care of me.
[time=2556] And He keeps the evil one from touching me, it says.
[time=2561] He can't touch me.
[time=2563] He can't bring me back into the life I was experiencing without Christ.
[time=2569] He can't do it.
[time=2571] It's like this.
[time=2572] I tried to figure out how to illustrate this touch.
[time=2575] It's really about adhering.
[time=2577] He cannot adhere to me anymore.
[time=2582] That's what it really means.
[time=2583] It means it's like glued to.
[time=2586] It's like velcroed.
[time=2588] He cannot velcro Himself to me anymore.
[time=2592] Just out of curiosity, anybody in the room remember life before Christ?
[time=2597] Anybody in the room want to just say it felt like being adhered to the evil one?
[time=2603] Yeah.
[time=2604] Anybody remember that feeling?
[time=2606] Exactly.
[time=2607] So in Christ, if I think of the velcro that I'm part of the velcro and Satan's part of the velcro,
[time=2614] the two halves that come together, in Christ it gets shaved off.
[time=2620] It's like I'm stainless steel.
[time=2623] Then he tried to attach to me.
[time=2626] He can't attach himself.
[time=2629] He can't adhere to me.
[time=2631] He can't do it because Christ keeps me from him.
[time=2635] [AMEN] Oh, man.
[time=2638] Why do I like that?
[time=2639] I'm protected from the evil one because I'm in Christ.
[time=2643] [AMEN] You can say amen.
[time=2647] [AMEN] Victory over sin.
[time=2651] Absolute number three.
[time=2652] Here's one for you.
[time=2654] You're a child of God in relationship with God.
[time=2658] John reminds the reader and he reminds you and I today that we are his.
[time=2663] We belong to him in the closest, most intimate way possible.
[time=2668] It says there in 19.
[time=2669] We know that we are of God, the of God there, translated a child of God.
[time=2676] We know that we are of God and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
[time=2685] Now remember friends in our study, according to John, as we've made our way through this epistle, there are only two types of people.
[time=2693] We're going to talk about children of.
[time=2696] According to John here, there are only two types of people in the world.
[time=2700] You are either a child of God or you are a child of the devil.
[time=2705] There's just those two families, if you will, in the spiritual realm.
[time=2711] No one can belong to both and no one can be in essence truly undecided, if that makes
[time=2719] sense.
[time=2720] The simple, yet profound point that Stephen and I want to make here is that when you bow
[time=2726] the knee of your heart to God, my friends, and when you fully surrender and completely
[time=2732] submit your heart and life to Christ, the Scriptures teach that you become a child of
[time=2739] God.
[time=2740] The Scriptures teach that you become a son of God, a daughter of God the Father.
[time=2748] I would just encourage you to think back through our study.
[time=2750] How many times did John begin a sentence, "My dear little children, my dear little
[time=2756] ones, mimicking and echoing this picture of God's love for His children?"
[time=2763] Romans 8, look at Romans 8, turn there if you would a great passage that just Paul and his letter to the church at Rome, he communicates this very same truth in very clear and graphic
[time=2773] ways, graphic meaning extremely, extremely clear for you have not received a spirit of
[time=2780] slavery leading to fear again, Paul says, but you have in Christ, he's talking about those who have come into relationship with Christ, he says, you have received a spirit of what?
[time=2790] Say it out loud.
[time=2792] Adoption as sons by which we cry out, "Abba, Father," many of you have heard this, but
[time=2799] others, if you may, maybe you haven't, that word "Abba" there is "dad." It's the most tender, it's the most affectionate, it's the most personal terms, it's "dad."
[time=2809] Abba, Father, the Spirit Himself, testifies within our spirit that we are, everybody together,
[time=2816] children of God, and if children, and not if, but because we are children, heirs, look
[time=2825] at that, heirs, heirs to the throne, heirs to the fortune, heirs to everything He has,
[time=2834] heirs to everything He's created, because you are a child of God, fellow heirs, not only
[time=2840] you're an heir, but you're a fellow heir with who?
[time=2842] Christ.
[time=2843] If indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him, you become the
[time=2850] recipient of all of His blessing and all of His wealth.
[time=2854] Now you may be here in the room this morning, you may be listening online, you may be watching on the broadcast, and you may be one who as part of our family and part of this community,
[time=2866] you may be spiritually still searching.
[time=2870] I know several of you here in the room this morning, and you know how thankful we are that you are here doing your best with God's help and maybe the help of some others here
[time=2881] trying to think through some of these most significant of issues spiritually in life.
[time=2888] You haven't given your life, your heart to Christ yet, and the Scriptures just called you a child of Satan.
[time=2896] It's important that you hear this.
[time=2899] This isn't God calling people names, I want to make sure you're clear on that.
[time=2903] He's not so much labeling you as He is stating your current address, if that makes sense.
[time=2911] He's clarifying the realm, the reality, the spiritual domain within which you exist.
[time=2919] Wow, this fits perfectly right there, do it.
[time=2923] I read this article in the U.S. News this week, and let me read what this young man says who
[time=2929] had been a meth addict, meth amphetamine addict.
[time=2933] He's written his memoirs, his dad wrote a book about him, he's still so lost, listen
[time=2940] to this.
[time=2941] I always felt just like really, really sensitive and overwhelmed by the world.
[time=2945] I was scared all the time.
[time=2947] I tried to fix that feeling by doing all these different things.
[time=2950] It wasn't just drugs, it was excessively exercising or being in relationships.
[time=2957] Even when I was prostituting on the street, this young man said, it was this feeling of I need someone to show me that I'm valuable, I need to be loved.
[time=2968] If I could just tell young people, if you feel insecure and scared, that's okay.
[time=2974] It is okay to face the reality of that, but his next sentence isn't true.
[time=2979] He says, it's a burden, but nothing that you ever look for outside yourself is ever, ever,
[time=2992] ever going to fill that hole.
[time=2997] When you look for outside of self or Christ, Christ in you, the hope of glory, Christ in
[time=3010] you, the one who fills you up.
[time=3014] What a powerful picture, I think for all of us to understand that in the filling, in the filling us up that he's done, we get to sense, I mean as he read that, you sense the longing
[time=3025] of a child who wanted desperately to have a dad, a father come alongside and communicate
[time=3032] how much he was loved and how much he meant to him.
[time=3036] I went to the jail this week, I went down to visit a friend and it was a good visit.
[time=3045] It was, I think the timing was off and I ended up having to wait for a while, but they had already sent me in, I don't know that you've ever been in the jail, visiting area there,
[time=3055] it's just like the movies, there's the glass and the seat and the phone and there's seven
[time=3061] or eight banks of that and I kind of went down to the end, I was just waiting and there
[time=3067] were a couple, I guess probably I'm not sure who they were, it looked like maybe it sounded like public defenders kind of getting their first conversation with some of these guys and there were four or five guys behind the window kind of waiting in line to talk to these two guys and I just listened and I just, I told Steve, it just struck me.
[time=3083] I didn't mean to eavesdrop but it was just me and them and they were talking and they were taking these prisoners through this list of questions, it says here you were incarcerated on this date, it says here that your name is this, it says here that your living relatives are boom boom boom, it says here that this was the charge, it says here your mother's name is so and so, it says here you have no father, it says here it says here you never knew your father and it has caught my attention and I just thought I'm kind of looking over
[time=3110] at this guy and there he is, he's just hardened and he's in jail, he's in this orange jumpsuit and he never knew his father and I thought wow, what a heart rate.
[time=3121] So that guy gets done, the next guy steps up, this public defendant goes through four interviews and while I'm there that day just so happens, everyone he went through as he got to that part of the deal, he says and it says here you never knew your father, four times in a row in 20 minutes.
[time=3140] So I don't care, I mean most of you haven't been in that spot, I'm just saying every one of us can identify with the longing to have that and all of us understand what happens
[time=3150] when you don't and the great absolute truth for you today is that you do, you're a child
[time=3157] of God.
[time=3159] The absolute number one, you can know you have eternal life.
[time=3163] Number two, you can know that he answers prayer.
[time=3167] Number three, you can know victory over sin and Christ.
[time=3172] Number four, you can know you're a child of God and this last one, you can know that Jesus
[time=3181] is truly God.
[time=3183] Think of verse 20 and we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding in order that we might know him who is true and we are in him who is true, John, it's not
[time=3199] some mistake that he does that twice.
[time=3202] In his son Jesus Christ, this is the true God and eternal life, not just the way to eternal
[time=3209] life, he is eternal life, being in him is being in eternal life.
[time=3215] Just a couple of things I told you there were two different kinds of knows, the first one in this passage in this verse is the same one we were talking about before, being known
[time=3225] and knowing because you're intimate, you're in a family, it's a domestic relationship where you're really close to each other.
[time=3231] We are known by him and we know him that way and then the second no is to learn to know,
[time=3237] to come to know, to get a knowledge of and perceive and I was thinking, I can get to know the fact that he is true in him, I understand who he is in here, he reveals himself to me.
[time=3250] We can know he's true, he is the true one, he is the true God, true that which has not
[time=3256] only the name and resemblance but the real nature corresponding to the name, true.
[time=3263] In every respect corresponding to the idea signified by the name, real, true, genuine,
[time=3270] Kelly is not an exact duplicate of Ed or Gail, those are your parents names, right, he's
[time=3282] not Christ is the exact representation of God.
[time=3292] In him, Colossians 1 says, God was pleased to have all of his fullness dwell, he's completely
[time=3300] true and we can know the true God in Christ.
[time=3308] We can rest in that absolutely this morning.
[time=3314] Well my friends, this Jesus who is the true God, watch this now.
[time=3321] This Jesus who by his death and resurrection offers us eternal life.
[time=3326] This Jesus and whose name we pray and as we pray these prayers are answered as we offer them in the will of God, this Jesus who gives us victory over sin, this Jesus whose death
[time=3338] allows us to be by virtue of the one who sent him, children of God, this Jesus who is truly
[time=3344] God himself, the deity of Christ, what we speak of there, all of that my friends is
[time=3352] what we are so hoping and longing to communicate and introduce to people next Sunday morning.
[time=3363] This is kind of a, I mean this is an Easter message in a sense just you know minus the
[time=3369] resurrection, small detail and we'll get to that Sunday but this is great, great truth and this is what we long to offer, this is what we can't wait to share, this is what not only are we looking forward to communicating in the gathering, this is the great truth my friends that you and I get to share and communicate each and every day of our life.
[time=3387] These are in a world where there are none, these are absolutes that change people, that
[time=3393] transform and God uses to redeem people so I hope you're preparing, I hope your heart is filled with anticipation, as we get the privilege of remembering the death and sacrifice
[time=3404] on Friday evening and then celebrating his life, come, come prepared both times Friday
[time=3410] and Sunday to do that very thing, to remember and celebrate these absolutes.
[time=3415] Would you stand?
[time=3416] Let me pray for us as we go, Father God we thank you for the great truth of your word
[time=3422] and the great comfort of that which is absolute, you, your son, your spirit, your word and
[time=3433] God these great principles that we've seen, principles that you've allowed to be at work in us.
[time=3438] Father we're so thankful that we get to in relationship with you, experience these things that are absolutely real and true and oh God that we could be used of you maybe, pass along
[time=3450] to others, the absoluteness of your character, God that we could be used by you to be priests
[time=3458] who pass along to others, this eternal life, this relationship with you that changes everything.
[time=3465] Oh God give us the wisdom and grace to do that well, bring us back together Friday evening
[time=3471] and Sunday morning if that be your will and we'll thank you for it and everybody agreed and said amen God bless you.
[time=3506] [MUSIC]
