[time=59] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=68] [MUSIC]
[time=73] Would you pray with me?
[time=77] Father, God, our hearts cry to you this morning, Hosanna.
[time=81] You are the God who saves us, and we want to welcome you in this place today.
[time=87] Our hearts and our souls just invite your presence among us and ask that you would dwell with us today in unique and powerful ways.
[time=96] We pray that you would continue to be the God of our salvation, that we wouldn't overlook our need for you and your grace today.
[time=106] And we pray, God, that you would move in our midst today in a way that transforms us and
[time=113] makes us more and more like your son, Jesus, and everyone said.
[time=121] I know that you are strong, I know you're more than able to save me from whatever ever comes my way.
[time=131] I know you are a healer, I know you can deliver, I know that you can rescue me.
[time=142] But even when I cannot see your hand, when you move in a way that I would not have left,
[time=154] still I will worship you.
[time=158] I will worship you in the mid-night hour, I will worship you.
[time=167] When I met the fire, I will worship you.
[time=172] When I walked deep, strong, I will stand and proclaim that you are the God I will worship you.
[time=188] I know that you are strong, I know you're more than able to save me from whatever ever comes my way.
[time=201] I know you are a healer, I know you can deliver, I know that you can rescue me.
[time=210] But even when we can't see, when you move in a way that I would not have left,
[time=224] still I will worship you in the mid-night hour, I will worship you.
[time=236] When I met the fire, I will worship you in the mid-night hour, I will stand and proclaim that you are the God I will worship you in the mid-night hour.
[time=266] I will worship you in the mid-night hour, I will worship you in the mid-night hour, I will worship you in the mid-night hour.
[time=323] When I met the fire, I will worship you.
[time=329] When I won't see, when I will stand and proclaim that you are the God I will worship you in the mid-night hour, I will worship you.
[time=345] When I met the fire, I will worship you in the mid-night hour, I will stand and proclaim that you are the God I will worship you.
[time=371] Well hello again everybody, welcome to the broadcast, it's great to have you with us.
[time=376] We are thankful that you're here and so grateful that many of you got to take in what you saw last week on the broadcast, which was our Easter Resurrection Sunday celebration.
[time=387] It was an amazing morning as we celebrated the most amazing of all events, the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and the life and the forgiveness and the hope and the future that He brings to those that know Him.
[time=402] As we thought about where to go from there, Steve Longbreak, one of our teaching pastors who you'll see today on the broadcast mentioned that He was going to this week just go to the book of Acts and really the book of Acts, as you begin to read through Acts, you realize that it is what took place after Easter.
[time=423] That's right, after Easter, where the Lord comes back He appears to the disciples, He appears to others and then at some point in time they're not long after, He ascends to the Father and having ascended to the Father, the disciples and the followers of Christ are left to do that which Christ called them to do and it was an amazing, amazing time in the life of those individuals
[time=451] and then what began there in Acts is the birth, the incredible birth of the church.
[time=457] And so what you'll see today is the beginning of this after Easter series and I'll come back next week and we're going to continue to look at what took place.
[time=466] What I want you to think about is this, what took place then I believe with all my heart can take place today.
[time=474] When you have Christ followers that are that willing, when you have leaders that are that bold and courageous, when you have people who are that unified in a cause and given to that which God has called them to, I still believe amazing things can take place.
[time=492] Join us, if you will, today and then in the weeks to come, as we look at the birth of the church, what took place after Easter, all that God did with these people who were willing to be used by Him and I think you'll be encouraged.
[time=506] I think you'll be challenged, I think you and I can get a whole new picture again of what the church can be when it's willing to be used of God after Easter.
[time=516] Hey, thanks for tuning in. We hope you'll come by sometime. We hope you'll give us a chance to meet you in the days to come, 9 o'clock and 1045 on Sunday mornings.
[time=526] We'd love to meet you. Have a great week. God bless you.
[time=546] When sorrows like sea will lose road.
[time=561] For ever my light, thou has taught me to say it is well, it is well, it is well, with my soul, it is well.
[time=590] It is well, with my soul, with my soul.
[time=600] It is well, with my soul.
[time=620] I see all the bliss of this glorious song.
[time=632] I see it not in part but the whole.
[time=644] Please stand to the cross and I bear in no more.
[time=656] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord of my soul.
[time=668] It is well, with my soul, it is well, with my soul.
[time=696] Lord, praise the Lord, praise the day, with my faith, shall He sign.
[time=712] Look how to be open at the soul.
[time=723] Oh, the talk shall be done, and the Lord shall be sent.
[time=735] Even so, it is well, with my soul.
[time=747] It is well, with my soul, with my soul.
[time=760] It is well, with my soul.
[time=821] You give and take away.
[time=832] My heart will choose to sing.
[time=838] Lord, dance and be your name.
[time=844] You give and take away.
[time=856] My heart will choose to sing.
[time=862] Lord, you give and take away.
[time=879] But my heart will choose to sing.
[time=885] Lord, dance and be your name.
[time=894] It is well, with my soul.
[time=923] Let's sing.
[time=924] Sing every blessing.
[time=926] Every blessing you pour out out.
[time=930] Turn back to praise.
[time=934] When the darkness closes in Lord, still I will say.
[time=940] Sing every blessing you pour out.
[time=997] Turn back to praise.
[time=1001] When the darkness closes in Lord, still I will say.
[time=1008] Sing the name of the Lord.
[time=1012] Sing every blessing you pour out.
[time=1041] [MUSIC - 82 seconds]
[time=1127] Father in heaven we want to bless your name today
[time=1135] when our souls are in the desert place and when our souls are in the wilderness.
[time=1140] We want to bless your name when the sun's shining down on us and when the world's all as it should be.
[time=1147] When peace like a river attended our way and when sorrows like sea billows rolled you are God and you are in control and nothing slips by your notice and your attention and we declare that you have our best in mind no matter what.
[time=1164] We don't claim to understand what that best is but we trust you to know what it is and to cause it to come to fruition.
[time=1174] We love you God and we put our faith and we put our stock in you.
[time=1179] [AMEN] [MUSIC - 272 seconds]
[time=1458] - This morning listening to these songs
[time=1465] and singing these songs, I just had a great time sort of reminiscing, thinking about, it's funny for me, certain songs, like I usually sit here, but there have been times in my life for events, often lots of different funerals, where I'd sit in different places or weddings, and I kind of visualized sitting in those places, and then I was thinking, when we started singing as well with my soul, I could see Dave Jeremiah across the street, first in the chapel, which we call the Asylum, and then I was thinking about him in the Convocation Center, how much he liked it as well with my soul, and we'd have to sing it over again, you know, because he really, really loved that song.
[time=1510] Those are good, really good memories, and I'm really excited because I really believe the next events that will be memories are going to be better than the ones that I've had in the past, because God's just so faithful to do incredible things, and this passage of Scripture that we're going to look at this morning in Acts chapter 1 is a description.
[time=1544] It's not prescribing something that we should be doing, it's not prescribing behavior for us, it's a description of what Jesus told his apostles in their response to that.
[time=1560] So this morning, if you sense something in your heart that's a prescription for you, that's from the Holy Spirit, and definitely not for me, because I'm not going to be prescribing anything.
[time=1575] Acts chapter 1, the resurrection, what now?
[time=1581] Let's start in verse 4.
[time=1584] Let's stand together, read verses 4 through 11.
[time=1592] On one occasion, while he was eating with them, interesting, resurrected Jesus, eating with them, he gave them this command, "Do not leave Jerusalem but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about, for John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit." So when they met together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom of Israel?" He said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you,
[time=1635] and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth." After he said this, he was taken up before their eyes and a cloud hid him from their sight.
[time=1648] They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going when suddenly two men dressed in whites stood beside them.
[time=1655] Men of Galilee, they said, "Why do you stand here looking into the sky?" The same Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.
[time=1669] Father in heaven, Jesus seated at your right hand.
[time=1676] Now, from that moment to this, Lord Jesus, you've been in heaven, and you're coming back.
[time=1688] And Lord, last week before Easter was heavy,
[time=1695] and I have a lot of remorse when I think of why you had to die on the cross for my sin.
[time=1703] But then Sunday comes and we rejoice in your resurrection and you give us hope.
[time=1708] And Lord, this week, my week has just been filled with hope.
[time=1713] And now we're going to look at this passage, Lord, and I really want to understand what you'd have us know about these words and what you did there.
[time=1726] Please help us.
[time=1727] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1730] You may be seated.
[time=1733] Well, he's been appearing for the past 40 days off and on to the apostles.
[time=1740] There are 11 of them at this point.
[time=1742] They're going to choose another one to make it 12 again.
[time=1745] But right now there are 11 apostles, and he's been meeting with them periodically.
[time=1750] And I thought, wow, what would that be like?
[time=1753] You're having some fish and some bread together, and he shows up and eats with you in his resurrected body.
[time=1762] What an incredible time that was for them.
[time=1765] And so this is one of those times in verse 4.
[time=1770] It says, on one occasion, while he was eating with them,
[time=1778] he gave them this command.
[time=1781] Interesting.
[time=1783] He gives this in the form of a command.
[time=1785] The command is to wait, and then he says, and you'll be my witnesses.
[time=1790] We'll see that.
[time=1791] But the command is to wait.
[time=1793] He says to them, do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my father promised, which you heard me speak about.
[time=1802] His command to the 11 is don't leave here.
[time=1807] Wait.
[time=1808] Something's coming.
[time=1810] You don't control when it comes or what it is.
[time=1813] Wait.
[time=1814] I looked that up because wait's an interesting word.
[time=1818] There are a lot of Hebrew forms of the word wait.
[time=1820] I sort of wanted this to mean that.
[time=1822] It means being wrapped up in God rather than just sitting in a corner.
[time=1825] This one actually in the Greek form, it just means wait.
[time=1829] You just stay there and wait.
[time=1832] And I don't like that.
[time=1834] I never enjoy waiting.
[time=1837] As a matter of fact, it's gotten a little ridiculous, and some of the things in my life have contributed to my inability to wait.
[time=1845] One of those is Tivo.
[time=1848] Nancy got me the DVR.
[time=1850] Isn't that right DVR?
[time=1852] It's not really Tivo, I don't think, but maybe it is.
[time=1854] Anyhow, I've gotten used to using my remote control so that I don't have to wait.
[time=1863] Well, I originally just eliminated commercials and picked this.
[time=1870] I got to, I assigned to my television what I want to watch.
[time=1873] I just love that.
[time=1875] And I can watch a football game in an hour.
[time=1879] And I can watch a pro basketball game or college game in a little less than an hour without, like I don't even watch the foul shots anymore.
[time=1886] I just kind of zip through those.
[time=1889] And I don't have to wait on anything.
[time=1891] But one of the bad things is I've been noticing lately, I'll be driving down the street.
[time=1897] And literally, something will happen.
[time=1902] And I'll miss part of it, and I'll start to reach for my remote to rewind
[time=1908] so I can see what I missed or something happens on the radio, a sermon.
[time=1912] I'm so used to rewinding and listening to the things that I literally start to think,
[time=1918] "Oh, I can rewind that." And then I go, "Oh, it's not Tivo.
[time=1922] It's real time." I love to get rid of all the stuff I don't want to watch and get to the things I want to watch.
[time=1933] But you know what?
[time=1936] We must need to wait for a reason.
[time=1938] They did.
[time=1939] So they had to wait.
[time=1942] They had to wait on the gift that the Father promised.
[time=1948] Here we have Father, Son, and Holy Spirit all over the place in this passage.
[time=1952] We have the Trinity in these verses over and over again.
[time=1957] And I sure don't get it.
[time=1961] I enjoy it.
[time=1963] I love the reality that He's three in one.
[time=1969] I don't get it at all.
[time=1971] When I start trying to define it saying, "This is the Spirit's job and this is the Son's job and this is the Father's." When I start to do that, pretty soon I bump into a passage that says, "Jesus did something I thought was the Spirit's job or the Spirit does something that I thought was Jesus's job or the Father does it all."
[time=1986] But what I'm really enjoying now, the older I get, is just enjoying the mystery of that.
[time=1993] The fact that, of course I don't get it.
[time=1996] He's God.
[time=1998] He's not the best man.
[time=2002] He's not just body, soul, spirit, mind.
[time=2006] He's not just that.
[time=2007] He's God.
[time=2008] I'm not going to get it.
[time=2010] So I love the fact that that's just weaved throughout here. You can see the reality of the Trinity.
[time=2016] And He says, "The Father has promised something to them and that Jesus, He said that I've spoken about."
[time=2025] In verse five, He says, "For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."
[time=2034] Holy Spirit.
[time=2036] Holy.
[time=2040] You've heard us talk about a lot of different ways.
[time=2042] Holy.
[time=2043] That's that mystery I was talking about.
[time=2045] Holy.
[time=2046] He's other than us.
[time=2047] He's not the greatest man.
[time=2048] He's not a great person.
[time=2050] He's God.
[time=2051] Holy Spirit.
[time=2052] Other.
[time=2053] Perfect in His otherness.
[time=2057] From us.
[time=2058] Holy.
[time=2059] And Spirit.
[time=2060] Spirit.
[time=2061] Really, it's like wind.
[time=2063] That word means wind, it means breath.
[time=2067] It's like Holy Spirit.
[time=2069] The divine breath of life.
[time=2071] That's sort of what it's like.
[time=2073] He's the divine breath of life.
[time=2077] Life.
[time=2078] Not just physical life, but real life.
[time=2081] Life.
[time=2082] In Christ.
[time=2084] With the Father.
[time=2086] By the wind.
[time=2088] The breath of the Spirit.
[time=2091] And Jesus says to the disciples, He says, "He's coming.
[time=2099] You're going to be baptized in Him." So wait.
[time=2108] In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit's an agent of creation.
[time=2113] He's a source of inspiration and power.
[time=2116] He's inspiring people at specific times like Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon, the prophets.
[time=2129] The Spirit of God came upon them.
[time=2131] The Spirit of God came upon Saul and the Bible says the Spirit left Saul.
[time=2136] He intermittently came and he rested on and he worked through people in the Old Testament.
[time=2142] And he was actually God's presence in the community of Israel.
[time=2149] God with them.
[time=2153] In the New Testament, he's called paraclete.
[time=2157] The different translations of that are the words we're comfortable with.
[time=2160] It's counselor, comforter, advocate.
[time=2164] He's our counselor.
[time=2165] He's our comforter.
[time=2166] He's our advocate to the Father.
[time=2169] He prays for us.
[time=2171] He gives power.
[time=2173] He leads.
[time=2174] He instructs.
[time=2175] He convicts.
[time=2176] He reproves.
[time=2177] He comforts.
[time=2178] He helps.
[time=2179] He teaches.
[time=2180] He guides.
[time=2181] He sanctifies.
[time=2182] He testifies.
[time=2183] He glorifies.
[time=2184] He grieves.
[time=2185] He moans.
[time=2186] And many, many more words that try to describe them.
[time=2189] I love it when there are lists of adjectives or adverbs that describe who God is or what
[time=2197] He does.
[time=2198] I love those lists.
[time=2199] I listen to SM Lockridge's message again.
[time=2201] He describes Jesus and he has about 30 or 40 of those descriptors.
[time=2206] In the middle of it, he says, "I wish I could describe him for you." After he uses all these words to describe, "I wish I could describe him." He's indescribable.
[time=2218] I remember there's a verse in the scripture that talks about the indescribable gift that God gives.
[time=2224] I was in teacher's devotions and I said, "What do you think that is?" And Tom Hopewell and his wife, said, "Steve, like you're asking us to describe what God calls the indescribable gift." He's indescribable.
[time=2241] The Holy Spirit coming up on them.
[time=2244] We can't describe it.
[time=2250] He chose to dwell in men.
[time=2257] So they're supposed to wait without Tivo.
[time=2262] And then the next verse says, "So," verse 6, "so," now, we don't know that this event
[time=2269] immediately follows the preceding one.
[time=2271] It might be the same event.
[time=2272] It might be later.
[time=2273] It doesn't say.
[time=2274] It just says, "so," referring back to what Jesus has said to them, it says, "so."
[time=2283] When they met together, they asked Him.
[time=2285] Now, this is interesting.
[time=2287] He says, "The Father is going to give you the gift of the Holy Spirit." You'll be receiving the Holy Spirit.
[time=2292] You'll be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
[time=2294] And their response to that is, whether it's later or right away, their response to that is, "When are you building the kingdom on earth?
[time=2303] When is that coming?" Look at what they say.
[time=2306] "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"
[time=2313] You know, think about it.
[time=2315] Israel, they're not in charge of Israel in those days.
[time=2319] They're looking forward to Israel being in charge not only of Israel, but the rest of the world, because God had said He was going to establish a kingdom on this earth.
[time=2328] They were looking forward to the King sitting on the throne in Jerusalem and reigning over
[time=2335] all the earth with Israel as His brethren for that.
[time=2342] So they asked Him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore?" And His response, "Incredible." Jesus says to them, "It's not for you to know the times or dates."
[time=2355] Those two words are really fun words to study.
[time=2359] Times or dates.
[time=2361] Times means something like the duration of the times.
[time=2367] How long are the times?
[time=2370] The word for dates is a word that really means that plus the kind of time that it is.
[time=2380] Easy time, hard time, good time, bad time.
[time=2386] So He says, "It's not for you to know the length of the time, nor is it for you to know what kind of time this is." He says, "You're just to wait." And I love.
[time=2399] He says, "It's not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by His own authority."
[time=2409] You know what?
[time=2412] He's the only one that has His own authority.
[time=2419] He's the only one.
[time=2424] God is the only.
[time=2425] He gives all authority.
[time=2429] He says, "Do not leave Jerusalem.
[time=2432] Stay there.
[time=2433] Wait.
[time=2434] The Father has something to give you and the Father has set by His own authority when these things are going to happen." If there's an application point that I grabbed, I don't know if this one's for you at all or not, but I thought, "Well, one of my problems, Steve's problem, is I don't want
[time=2454] to wait on the authority that He's established in my life to live out His authority.
[time=2465] I don't want to wait for that." But He says, "They need to."
[time=2476] And then He says, "These times, they're from the Father and He knows about them and nobody
[time=2482] else does." There are a couple of passages that we can refer to.
[time=2485] Look at Matthew 24.
[time=2487] Matthew 24 verses 1 through 5, first of all, says, "Jesus left the temple and was walking
[time=2494] away when His disciples came up to Him to call His attention to its buildings." Do you see all these things, He asks?
[time=2500] We tell you the truth.
[time=2501] Not one stone here will be left on another.
[time=2504] Everyone will be thrown down.
[time=2507] As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately.
[time=2512] Tell us, they said, "When will this happen?
[time=2516] And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" Jesus answered.
[time=2522] Watch out that no one deceives you.
[time=2524] For many will come in my name, claiming I am the Christ and will deceive many.
[time=2530] Many will come saying they know when.
[time=2537] Now, let's jump ahead to verse 36 in the same chapter.
[time=2540] Matthew 24 verse 36, it says, "No one knows about the day or hour, not even the angels
[time=2546] in heaven, nor the Son, interesting, but only the Father.
[time=2553] As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
[time=2556] For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark.
[time=2564] And they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away.
[time=2569] That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
[time=2573] Two men will be in the field.
[time=2574] One will be taken away in the other left.
[time=2577] Two women will be grinding with a hand mill, one will be taken in the other left.
[time=2582] Therefore, keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
[time=2587] Waiting and watching, waiting and watching.
[time=2592] Not easy for me.
[time=2594] That's what he tells the disciples to do then and the apostles to do in Acts 1.
[time=2600] The Father has set the days, the times, the dates, the context of the time, all of that
[time=2610] set under his authority and he tells the apostles to wait for it.
[time=2616] And then in verse 8 says, "But," interesting, the first memory verse I ever taught anybody
[time=2628] at Blackhawk Christian school was Acts 1, 8.
[time=2632] It was 1979.
[time=2633] It was a seventh grade Bible class across the street.
[time=2637] Lance Clark, some of you know him.
[time=2639] He was in there.
[time=2640] He did not learn it very well.
[time=2643] Acts 1, 8.
[time=2644] And I always thought it was interesting to start a memory verse with the word "but."
[time=2650] But that is what the book did.
[time=2651] We were using a book and I was sticking to it and I was young enough then that I did what the book said.
[time=2655] So we learned "but." And the "but" there is there because it's not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his authority.
[time=2665] It's not for you to know, but you will receive power.
[time=2672] You're not going to know the times and dates.
[time=2675] You don't know when, you don't know what, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit
[time=2681] comes on you.
[time=2683] And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in El Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.
[time=2688] But instead of knowing times and dates and what was going to happen, they do know this.
[time=2698] Two things.
[time=2699] They're going to receive power.
[time=2701] You know what?
[time=2702] I shouldn't even say it that way.
[time=2705] They're going to receive power.
[time=2708] That probably blew something, didn't it?
[time=2711] They're not going to receive power.
[time=2715] That's the same word that we get dynamite from.
[time=2718] They're going to receive power.
[time=2723] It's really hard to sign that loud.
[time=2732] Hard work, isn't it?
[time=2737] You know, that's what he was saying to them.
[time=2740] You don't have to know the dates and the times because I'm going to give you power.
[time=2747] You're going to receive power.
[time=2748] The Father is sending the powerful one who will empower you when the Holy Spirit comes
[time=2757] on you.
[time=2758] And then he says, you're going to receive power and you're going to be my witnesses.
[time=2767] He doesn't say, hey, would you be willing, pleased to be my witness?
[time=2771] He didn't say, you've seen me now, later on, you're going to have some opportunities.
[time=2777] I hope they come up and I hope he said, you are going to be my witnesses.
[time=2784] I don't think the apostles at this point, they're not making a choice about whether they're going to follow him or not.
[time=2789] As a matter of fact, it's incredible.
[time=2790] There is not one account of the apostles wavering from this point on.
[time=2795] And they went through terrible, terrible suffering.
[time=2800] As a matter of fact, they became martyrs most of them.
[time=2804] And that word that's translated witness there in Acts chapter 1 is the word for martyr.
[time=2811] It's a word that really means giving yourself up for something more important.
[time=2817] It means sacrificing yourself to testify to that which is significant.
[time=2826] And he says, you'll be that for me.
[time=2828] A person who sacrifices something of great value for the sake of something or someone else.
[time=2833] As a matter of fact, even to death.
[time=2836] And they experienced that.
[time=2838] They lost their lives, but get this.
[time=2843] Before they ever lost their lives, they gave their life.
[time=2848] They gave their life to be his witnesses.
[time=2853] It reminded me of Romans 12 there, I couldn't help it.
[time=2860] Those guys, I urge you therefore, brethren, in view of God's mercies to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God which is your spiritual form of worship.
[time=2870] They gave their life and he told them they were going to, but they didn't do it on their
[time=2876] own.
[time=2877] They had power, his power, and later we're going to be able to talk about that day, not
[time=2886] today we won't, but we're going to talk about the day that power came.
[time=2893] It's the ability to act or produce an effect, there's a cause, Jesus is the cause.
[time=2900] He's producing the effect or the outcome through the people that were just willing sacrifices
[time=2906] to do what he wanted them to do.
[time=2909] Witnesses.
[time=2911] They're people who speak from personal experience.
[time=2914] When you go to court and they have witnesses come in, they speak from their personal experience.
[time=2922] These guys had a lot of personal experience, but the witnessing that they were going to
[time=2928] be doing, I'll get this, is by the power of the witness who knew it all.
[time=2937] Not just their experiences, they were empowered by the Holy Spirit who knows it all.
[time=2946] Well, I've seen, I've seen people like the apostles, I've seen them here, I've seen them
[time=2962] in other places, I've seen, I've seen carpenters who were empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2973] And they worship God in their carpentry.
[time=2977] I see them here and I've seen them Judea, Samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth.
[time=2986] I've seen them practice their carpentry and bring glory to God in the excellence of their
[time=2995] carpentry, here and there.
[time=2998] I've seen carpenters here and there who haven't been filled with the Holy Ghost, who haven't
[time=3011] been expressions of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3015] And they do some carpentry that's pretty amazing, but it's not the same kind of carpentry.
[time=3021] I've seen them here and I've seen, I've seen carpenters there.
[time=3025] I've seen them on the mission field and it doesn't appear that.
[time=3032] I don't know this, but I've seen people that it didn't appear that the Spirit of God was the power that did the work that they're doing and you have to be careful.
[time=3041] I judge their work, not their motivation, but it doesn't appear that their carpentry is
[time=3050] done in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3053] I don't see the relational things going on that the Holy Spirit does.
[time=3057] I've seen lawyers here and there, same way, maintenance workers here and there, counselors,
[time=3069] farmers, medical professionals, educators.
[time=3073] I've seen them here and I've seen them there and some of them, by the power of the Holy
[time=3079] Spirit, they do their farming in ways that are unbelievable witnesses to the living God.
[time=3089] And they do their law practice and they do their education and they do their maintenance work in unbelievable, here and there.
[time=3097] Judea, Samaria, uttermost part is in here and it's not about them and how they do it.
[time=3108] It's about who it is that empowers them.
[time=3118] Those guys, you know what they did?
[time=3121] They fished again.
[time=3127] I wonder what their fishing was like, but in the power of the Holy Spirit, a lot better
[time=3135] than years' raves.
[time=3140] Verse 9 says, "After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes and the cloud hid him from their sight." Now, that was an anxious moment that must have been for me.
[time=3151] If I'm with him and he said, "Wait, the power of the Holy Spirit is going, 'Yeah, I want that, I'm going to establish my kingdom, yeah, I want that, and then he leaves.
[time=3162] And I don't want that.
[time=3165] They watch him go and it says he gets hidden by a cloud."
[time=3172] And verse 10, "They were looking intently up into the skies he was going when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them." And they say to these apostles, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into
[time=3185] the sky?" Can you just picture it, these 11?
[time=3193] I mean, have you ever walked up on a crowd where everybody's doing that, and then you look up and you see nothing?
[time=3200] That's what's going on right then.
[time=3201] They don't see anything, they're just still looking.
[time=3204] He says, "Why are you looking at the sky?" These two guys do.
[time=3210] What?
[time=3215] The same Jesus who's been taken from you into heaven, still there, will come back in the
[time=3224] same way you have seen him go into heaven.
[time=3228] We have descriptions of that in the Bible a couple of places.
[time=3231] First Thessalonians talks about it, he's going to come back.
[time=3235] I think it's going to be a different cloud, but he's going to come back and the dead in
[time=3241] Christ are going to rise up out of the grave.
[time=3246] It's really interesting.
[time=3248] I know who 11 of them probably are, those bodies.
[time=3253] So those bodies are going to come up out of the grave.
[time=3256] Before he gets here, they're going to join him.
[time=3260] And those of us who are alive, if we're still alive, it says, "We'll be caught up with them
[time=3266] in the air, to be with him how long, forever, forever."
[time=3276] Their bodies are coming out of the grave.
[time=3277] Mine might be, by the way, Corbin, I want two of those songs at my funeral, still, what's
[time=3287] the one about the still I will worship?
[time=3291] And that's to be the name.
[time=3293] That's number 66 and 67.
[time=3295] I told Kelly, "I don't want any eulogies.
[time=3297] I want all those songs I've loved, all that time.
[time=3300] No eulogies." Kelly can still preach, that'll be all right.
[time=3308] If I'm not here, if I'm not here, then just have that, enjoy that, and look forward to
[time=3315] being with me.
[time=3316] We're going to meet again in the air with them.
[time=3320] Now, if we happen to still be here, if it happens, for me, it better be quick.
[time=3326] But if we still are here, we're going to be caught up with those 11.
[time=3334] And I just think, "Oh my, I don't have to know when I'm thankfully told me some of
[time=3341] the what, but it's only by His power that any of this happens."
[time=3350] Do you know how much power Peter and James and John had on their own meaningless power?
[time=3359] But in a few days, they're going to receive the power of the Holy Spirit of God.
[time=3369] And they were willing to wait.
[time=3374] And then we know they lived in Him for the rest of their lives, and they established
[time=3383] the church.
[time=3384] I'm so thankful they did.
[time=3388] Our Father in Heaven, we bow down.
[time=3398] We bow down, and we physically bow down sometimes, and Lord, our hearts are bowed before you.
[time=3405] Our Father in Heaven, Your precious Son, the Holy Spirit of God, we bow down before you.
[time=3414] And we thank You for Your presence in our life.
[time=3418] I thank You that You empowered 11 men, common Galileans, to build Your church.
[time=3430] I thank You that You empowered them, and they were able, they were able to teach and establish
[time=3439] truth.
[time=3440] I'm so grateful, Lord.
[time=3444] And like them, Lord, I'm looking up.
[time=3449] I'm not looking up into an empty sky, but I'm really an anticipation waiting for You
[time=3457] to come.
[time=3460] And I thank You that You've told us what You've told us about it, and I thank You for the mystery that's around what I don't know.
[time=3467] And I just pray, Lord, that You'll accept our praise, our adoration, and Lord, I'm thankful
[time=3475] that You use those men to build the church.
[time=3479] I'm thankful in Christ's name, amen.
