[time=60] Well hello again everybody, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=62] It is a joy to have you with us, and we're so thankful for the chance to meet with you like this each and every week.
[time=69] I hope this morning as you watch the message, I hope you'll have an openness in your heart.
[time=75] I hope there'll be a sense in you where you're really looking for what God will have for you, as we celebrate, as we continue to celebrate the reality of what took place in the lives of our apostles,
[time=88] what took place in the lives of those faithful Christ followers after Easter.
[time=95] That's what we've entitled this recent series that we're in after Easter.
[time=100] It was, if you know anything at all about church history and if you don't know anything, then this is a great chance for you to get caught up.
[time=108] When you study church history, the real church, what happened there at the very beginning of God's redemptive agent, the church, you realize this was an incredible time in the life of the church.
[time=120] God did amazing things through these faithful followers of Christ who upon his ascension into heaven,
[time=127] after he appeared to the disciples a number of times and then he ascends into heaven and sits
[time=134] at the right hand of the Father. From then on, God's redemptive story is in the hands of these
[time=140] faithful few and it is an amazing story. And as we tell that story and as we study those passages,
[time=147] I hope your heart will be encouraged. There is a lot for you and I to understand and see there is a
[time=153] great deal for us as a church. There is a great deal for us as a church to understand and see, as we think about the kind of church that we're willing to be. I hope you had a great, great
[time=164] resurrection weekend. It's been a couple of weeks. Maybe you've been on spring break but I want to just tell you we're so thankful for what the rest of the spring holds. I want to ask you if you would to pray for me. I know many of you watch each and every week. For some of you, this is your church home and we want to just let you know that I'll be heading off to Nairobi, Kenya on the 17th of
[time=185] April and we are so blessed and so fortunate to be building a friendship and a great relationship
[time=191] with an orphanage over there. A new life home trust and I'll be taking about 10 folks from the Black Hawk family and we'll be in Kenya in Nairobi there until the 27th. And I want to just ask if you'd
[time=202] pray. Pray for those precious little kids that we'll be with and working with. Pray for the staff
[time=208] over there as we continue to build a relationship with them. Pray for the future ministry that we'll
[time=214] have with them. They have so many needs, physical medical needs, physical plant needs. There are so
[time=220] many ways, educationally, that we can help in the days to come. I'd love it if you would commit to pray for us while we're there. I'm looking forward to it. I can't wait to take friends of ours from
[time=231] Black Hawk to this place that I've already been and expose them to God at work in a place far,
[time=237] far away. Thank you for praying. Thanks for your friendship. Thank you for your support
[time=243] of the Bible Hour. We're so thankful for you and my hope is that today you'll be blessed and encouraged because of our time together. Have a great week. God bless you and as always we hope
[time=254] to see you soon. And David saying of the Almighty, "My God is my rock, my shield and the horn of my
[time=262] salvation." God surrounds the righteous with his favor as with a shield. God is a shield for all
[time=270] who take refuge in him. As the choir sings this song, think about how God is your shield.
[time=277] Many are they in creeds that trouble me. Many are they that rise up against me.
[time=292] Many there be which say of our soul. There is no help for him
[time=306] in God. God, our shield for me. My glory and the letter of my day. God, our shield for me.
[time=335] My glory and the letter of my day. God, our shield for me. My glory and the letter of my day.
[time=360] God, our shield for me. My glory and the letter of my day.
[time=377] I cry unto the Lord and Lord to make the King out of his holy King.
[time=391] I thank the God, the Son, and the King for the Lord to say.
[time=404] I thank the Lord, our shield for me. My glory and the letter of my day.
[time=585] Let me ask you a question this morning as we get started. Think of a time in your life.
[time=601] Think of a circumstance you found yourself in. Think of something that you went to something and you heard someone speak. Maybe it was more of a personal setting. Maybe it happened within the context of growing up. But just think about a time in your life where something really significant happened. Somebody said something to you. You got a hold of something
[time=621] that was absolutely kind of life changing. Think of a moment in your life where you experienced something and it really changed you. You were like this prior to it and then you came to this
[time=635] event, you came to this time, you came to this scene and you went through it and having gone
[time=642] through it, it really, really changed your view. It really changed your perspective. It really
[time=649] changed your activity. I've been around here for 12 years. Most of you have heard the story.
[time=654] I won't get into it all this morning. But there was an event of that nature with me with a young man named Mark Menendez. I've told you the story. It's kind of funny. It's a little poignant. But I was in fourth grade. As I've mentioned to you before, in fourth grade I was basically this tall. 200 pounds less with the same head and same ears. So it was kind of a,
[time=673] it's kind of a, everybody go aw. Yeah, it's kind of a sad scene. And I took a lot of grief for how
[time=680] tall and skinny and awkward I was. And there was nobody who gave me more grief in fourth grade than Mark Menendez. He followed me wherever I went on the playground. He followed me home from school. He followed me to school. He mentally and physically abused me. He just, I never could
[time=696] figure out why he hated me so much. But he did. A little short Hispanic kid, real stocky and strong.
[time=703] And I'm telling you, he beat me down physically and emotionally. One time after months and months
[time=710] and months of this and months and months of me going home to my dad and my mom who would tell me
[time=716] all the time that I was to turn the other cheek. I was beginning to feel as if I was running out of cheeks. And one night I came home, Mark had gotten a hold of me on the way home from school.
[time=727] My eye was a little bloody, a little swollen, a little puffy. I was embarrassed and humiliated
[time=733] again in front of a bunch of my friends. I was sitting in my room. My mom had told my dad when
[time=739] my dad came home, he came in the room and he sat me down. And this event, this event happened.
[time=744] Words got spoken that changed everything. And my dad sat there and he put his arm around me, fourth grade, put his arm around me, said, I'm proud of you. You've done well. Don't ever let
[time=756] him do that to you again. And my chest, while I had no chest, really. My shoulders went back,
[time=764] my head lifted, my spirit's, you know, sword. And I remember laying in bed that night, I couldn't
[time=771] wait. I wanted the night to go by so fast because I knew what was coming. Got to school that day,
[time=777] first recess, grabbed the basketball. He'd never, Mark would never let me play basketball. He would close the game and boot me out, physically boot me out. So I grabbed the basketball, ran to
[time=786] the court that day they all came. There was Mark walked up to me, kind of kicked me in the shins that you're not playing. Before he could get out, you're not playing. My fist was halfway down his throat. The poor kid never knew what hit him. I jumped on him on the ground. They pulled me off,
[time=800] teacher on duty, took me to the principal's office. They called my dad. He came, got me, took me to get an ice cream. And he and, and he and, and he and I had a really good day.
[time=810] And I was, I was like this, you know, before that night on the edge of my bed. And after that
[time=819] night on the edge of my bed, I was like this. I was different. It was a whole different perspective.
[time=825] Kind of a silly illustration, but watch this. I want to just remind you, my friends, we've had a great, we had a, so many of us in this family have had just a phenomenal six weeks of preparing for
[time=836] that, that blessed day, that amazing celebration that we've got to have here just a couple of
[time=842] weeks ago. Resurrection Sunday and all that it represented, all that it represents, all that it
[time=848] means. What we were able to experience as we prepared for that, the daily scripts or readings,
[time=854] the fasting, many of you are still engaged from what I hear. Many of you still just keeping on
[time=860] with your commitments to do without in an effort to be reminded of all that God is.
[time=866] The alms giving, I don't know if you've heard, but almost $9,000, $9,000 in change offering,
[time=876] small bills, some checks, few larger bills, almost $9,000 now going to Nairobi with us and just a,
[time=884] a week and a half or so, now going to Nairobi to an orphanage, orphanages five total under the umbrella of New Life Home Trust, $9,000 going to meet real needs in the lives of little ones who
[time=896] desperately need it in a place far away. We had an amazing time as we, as we geared up for that
[time=902] celebration and as we experienced that celebration that day, what an overwhelming sense I had and
[time=908] what an overwhelming sense many of you had as we realized the significance of that day,
[time=914] the significance of that great truth of a resurrected Lord. And what I want to remind you of this
[time=920] morning is that the 12 who followed him, really the 120 or so as you read through the scriptures,
[time=926] you realize that there were more than the 12, there were a hundred and some change, some very faithful followers who had experienced pretty much everything with him and his earthly ministry. There was 120 or so folks who had, had listened to him as he delivered the sermon on the
[time=943] mound, they had seen him heal, they had seen him bring back to life, they had seen him deliver messages, they had seen him deal with the enemy. There were these faithful followers of Christ who
[time=954] had seen him be brought to his knees in the garden, they saw him crucified and they had experienced
[time=961] a risen Lord. There were these faithful followers of Christ and what I want to remind you of this morning my friends as we think about these next few weeks and this series that we've entitled after Easter, the resurrection, it changed everything for them. They were like this prior to that morning
[time=983] characterized by known for, even depicted in scripture as clumsy at times in terms of what
[time=992] they knew and how they thought clueless at times in terms of what they really understood and what
[time=999] they saw in terms of the future and what was coming. They were faithful and they were following but they were like this prior to the resurrection. Then the dad had the conversation with the son
[time=1010] on the side of the bed thing. Then an event happened and they were different completely and absolutely
[time=1019] and thoroughly different. And it's an amazing thing when you stop and think it about it. My
[time=1025] friends, these folks had put everything on the line. These folks, these faithful followers of Christ, they lived in a day and they lived in a time that when you raised your hand and said you were in,
[time=1036] when they identified themselves as Christ followers, they put their very lives at stake.
[time=1046] Everything that they knew, everything that they owned, family, friends, when they would gather in those days, they would gather not wondering who was going to be there. They would gather wondering who wasn't going to be there, who had been taken captive, who had been martyred for their
[time=1062] faith, who had been taken away, separated from their family. These were people who had put everything on the line and the resurrection was the one thing that sealed the deal for them
[time=1073] and it should seal the deal for you. What we experienced two Sundays ago here in this room
[time=1080] should make us different, should instill us with a vision, should instill us with a power and a grace that should instill us with a courage that we've never seen or known before. It did them
[time=1092] and I think it still can in your life and mind. And so I can't wait for us to just spend some time
[time=1101] as we look through the pages of the first part of the book of Acts. Where did they go? What did they do? How did they respond individually? And as a church, what are some things that we can glean
[time=1113] from these faithful followers of Christ in these days after Easter? These days that changed the
[time=1122] then-known world due to a God whose power was at work, I know, but the agents that he used
[time=1129] were these early believers. Think about what had transpired. The bloody and brutal beating of
[time=1136] good Friday had come and gone and at the Jews' insistence the Romans had murdered Jesus just as the Old Testament prophecies had predicted. After three days Christ defeated death and the resurrection had become a reality as sin was ultimately conquered and Satan's power permanently
[time=1152] vanquished. As the days then turned into a couple of weeks, a risen Lord appears multiple times
[time=1158] to those who had followed and served him, telling them eventually that they were, that redemptive history would be theirs to fulfill, telling them that God's salvation, what Jesus tells them as he appears to them, as he lets them know his plan is that they are
[time=1174] God's salvation plan for sinful man. They will carry the message. The helper, Jesus says,
[time=1180] the Holy Spirit, will be sent, but they would be the human agents. Now functioning as the body of
[time=1187] Christ, the church, to carry out and proclaim, to embody and represent, to teach and to offer
[time=1195] the gospel. This was their charge. This was their purpose. This was why they would, this was their
[time=1202] life. This was what they were now giving themselves to completely, to represent and embody, to communicate,
[time=1210] proclaim, teach and carry out the gospel to a searching and empty world. Do you understand the
[time=1216] gospel? Someone says to you, you know, that maybe it's your job or your opportunity to embody
[time=1223] and represent and carry out and proclaim the gospel to a lost and empty world. The gospel,
[time=1231] my friends, means good news. You can write that down. It is the good news. It is the good news
[time=1237] of Jesus Christ. It is the good news of what he has accomplished. It's the good news for you and
[time=1244] for me. It's the good news for a lost and empty world of what they can experience in relationship, not in religion, but in relationship with Jesus Christ, the gospel. Watch this. The good news that
[time=1258] in relationship with Christ, sins are forgiven. Shame and regret erased. Hope and purpose are granted
[time=1268] and eternity with God is secured. So there they sit, open to acts. It's just, it's exciting for me,
[time=1279] even as we come to it again here this morning, for me, and I kind of hope I can paint a picture
[time=1286] for you that will excite you as well. I want you just to imagine this in your mind. I want you to try and picture this. 120, the apostles and the 120 or so people, kind of the faithful core of
[time=1300] his followers, who really have put everything on the line. When you come to Acts 2, go to Acts 2,
[time=1306] it says in Acts 2 verse 1, it says, "When the day and actually in honor of God's word, would you
[time=1313] stand?" And let me just read this to you. It says in Acts 2, "When the day of Pentecost had come,
[time=1323] Pentecost," in my study Bible on the note below, it says, "Pentecost means 50th." And it refers to
[time=1329] the feast of weeks or the feast of harvest, which was celebrated 50 days after the Passover,
[time=1337] most likely in the month of May. It was one of the three annual feasts, and I want you to hear this.
[time=1343] This will come back into our discussion in the days to come here soon. It was one of the three annual feasts for which the entire nation was to come back to Jerusalem, back to Jerusalem at
[time=1356] Pentecost, an offering of first fruits was made. And now here at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit comes on
[time=1363] this day as the first fruit of the believer's inheritance. When the day, chapter 2 verse 1,
[time=1371] when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together, it says, in one place. You see that
[time=1378] most scholars and most biblical commentators will tell you that this place, that the 120 are now
[time=1385] gathered in, they were all gathered in one place. Most will tell you it's the upper room. Most will say that they're now back in the very same room where they had experienced the last supper with the
[time=1396] Lord prior to His arrest and beating and crucifixion. Interesting as I read this week that in the
[time=1404] archaeological findings of this culture and this context, this first century culture, you know,
[time=1410] they didn't build rooms for 120. It didn't happen. And I want you to again understand and just try
[time=1419] to imagine what they were feeling. Everything, their lives even was on the line. And they were
[time=1428] told, Steve taught, Steve did such a good job last week of teaching and reminding us that they had been told to what? To wait. So they have no idea what the future holds. They have no idea what's
[time=1440] going to happen to them. They have no idea what the Jewish or Roman authorities, the Roman authorities
[time=1446] and the Jewish leaders, they knew who they were. They probably knew where they were and they huddle in this upper room, scared to death, it's my guess, wondering what's going to happen to them,
[time=1458] but waiting because the Lord told them to wait. And they were together. They weren't scattered.
[time=1466] They didn't have other plans. They did not feel like gathering. No, everything was at stake.
[time=1476] And so they gathered in one place, it says, and suddenly there came from heaven a noise like
[time=1483] a violent rushing wind all through the Scriptures. The Spirit of God is oftentimes metaphorically
[time=1489] looked at as wind and rushing wind. It says here from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind
[time=1495] came and it filled the whole house where they were sitting and there appeared to them tongues as a fire distributing themselves and they the tongues rested on each of them and they were all
[time=1508] filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit was giving them
[time=1516] utterance. So there they sit in an upper room somewhere in Jerusalem waiting
[time=1524] for redemptive history to begin, for the church to begin. And my friends,
[time=1531] does it ever? Does it ever begin? Wow. Father God, what a privilege to just try our best to put
[time=1540] ourselves in their place to sense and to know the anxiousness they must have felt. Maybe the fear
[time=1548] that was rushing through them, but at the same time God, the boldness encouraged that your resurrection had brought and a willingness to sit in a room crammed in there with no space and no
[time=1559] clue of what was to come, but simply the promise of our Lord who had told them the helper was coming.
[time=1565] And so God, as we look through these pages in the days to come, as we consider principles that
[time=1572] we believe really do apply for our efforts today, this great endeavor, this same endeavor that you have them on, God, that we get to share in here at Blackhawk. May you teach us and grow us and may we gain in our understanding of the kind of people individually you'd want us to
[time=1588] be as followers of Christ and the kind of church that you'd want us to be as we give ourselves to
[time=1594] your design for ministry. God, thank you for this time this morning. Bless it, grow us and
[time=1600] teach us in your son's name we pray. Amen. You can be seated. Well, what you see here in Acts 2 and
[time=1610] even in just these first few verses that we've looked at this morning, it really is the beginning
[time=1616] of something absolutely unspeakably amazing. And right from the beginning, we see and Steve did a
[time=1623] great job of beginning to teach and explain this to us last week. Right from the beginning, we see that very prominently right in the center of it all is the Holy Spirit's coming.
[time=1634] There is some Holy Spirit activity here in Acts 2 that really even as Steve taught last week and
[time=1641] even as we looked at emails this week and I had some conversations with many of you that it immediately
[time=1647] brings up questions about the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is an amazing issue. It plays prominently, obviously here in God's design for the church and its beginnings. It continues to play
[time=1658] the Holy Spirit does. He continues to play a prominent role in your life and mind. And so as we thought about it before we jump in this morning to some of these timeless principles and there really are some principles. I want to say this to you. Steve mentioned this last week as we read through and study the early portion here of the book of Acts. There will be some things that we'll notice. There will be some things there in the text that I believe are descriptive as Steve said, descriptive, not necessarily prescriptive. There are some things that we'll see that were just very
[time=1688] special things that God did in a very special way, in a very special place, at a very special and
[time=1694] unique point in time. Things that I don't believe necessarily are prescriptive for us today in terms
[time=1702] of how the everyday of your faith and mind and the everyday of this ministry should function.
[time=1708] But there are some things in Acts that we believe are extremely prescriptive, things that principles
[time=1714] that we should hang on to, principles that really do apply still today to your experience in minus
[time=1721] Christ followers and our experience as a church. So we'll look at those, some timeless principles that I believe we see here in the early stages of Acts that I can't wait for us to look at. But first of all, just as a way of maybe answering some questions and giving us some insights, some of you in the room have never heard any teaching on the Holy Spirit. Others of you in the room may be half but could use a reminder. Maybe it would be encouraging for you to see again how this works according to God's Word. So I just wrote down some questions that I had been hearing
[time=1751] this week, some questions that we jotted down from last week. And let me just do my best to give you some insights here from the Scriptures. Were the apostles, somebody asked as they
[time=1762] read through here the first part of Acts 2, were the apostles baptized or filled with the Holy
[time=1769] Spirit in Acts 2? Were the apostles baptized? Is what we see going on here, in other words,
[time=1776] is what we see going on here in Acts 2, the Spirit of God indwelling the apostles, baptizing them in
[time=1784] the Spirit, or is what we see here somehow a filling of the Spirit. And what's the difference
[time=1790] between the two distinctions? It's a great question. Let me do my best to just kind of talk you through this. What we see in Acts 2 for the apostles is both. It's a very unique setting. And Steve
[time=1804] mentioned this last week. What you see here with the apostles, it's not your experience in mind,
[time=1810] and I'll get to that in a moment. But for the apostles, what we see happening at the beginning of Acts 2 is both the baptism of the Spirit, the indwelling of the Spirit, and we see them also
[time=1822] in that same setting. And the Scriptures even says it, them being filled with the Spirit.
[time=1827] Now, some I remember growing up hearing my dad say again and again, there is one indwelling
[time=1834] in the life of a believer, one indwelling many fillings. Let me just show you how this works.
[time=1842] So as far as the apostles, both things took place. Let's take those two things and let's kind of break it down into how it works for us today. Can I show you this? How does it work for us today?
[time=1852] Let's talk about being baptized or indwelled. And let's turn to Romans 8. Well, you do that.
[time=1858] Turn to Romans 8 verses 9 to 11. Just the next book after Acts, go to Romans 8 verses 9 to 11.
[time=1867] And actually, let's go back to, go to 8, go to 7, just to give you some context, because the mind,
[time=1873] talking about the mindset on the flesh from verse 6 says in 7, because the mindset on the flesh
[time=1880] is hostile toward God, for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able
[time=1888] to do so. And those who are in the flesh, those who haven't surrendered their heart and life to Christ,
[time=1894] those who are not in Christ, those who are not true or genuine believers cannot please God.
[time=1900] However, verse 9, here you go, you believer, he writes to the church at Rome, you who have been saved,
[time=1906] you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit. If indeed the spirit of God dwells in you,
[time=1913] but if anyone does not have the spirit of Christ, the spirit of God, he does not belong to him,
[time=1920] because if you belong to him, when you came to him, you received the spirit. But if anyone does not
[time=1926] have the spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him. If Christ is in you, though the body is dead
[time=1932] because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness, when Christ is in you, the spirit
[time=1940] is alive. But if the spirit, this is great, look at this, verse 11, but if the spirit of him
[time=1946] who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also
[time=1956] give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit who dwells in you. Please don't ever forget that,
[time=1964] my friends, that the very, not a junior apprentice of, not an other team member of, but no, the very
[time=1975] spirit of God that raised Jesus from the dead, the very spirit of God that was at work in that
[time=1984] tomb that day is the very same spirit of God that when you bow the knee of your heart and you fully
[time=1992] surrender your heart and life to him, that's the very same spirit that the scripture teaches
[time=1998] indwells you, comes into you, takes up residence in your heart and soul, very same spirit.
[time=2006] It's an amazing truth and that is what takes place. This is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2013] This is the indwelling of the spirit of God that takes place at the point where you or I come to faith. Titus 3, would you look there? Titus 3, 5, and 6. I think this will be on the
[time=2026] screen. There you go. He saved us. He saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
[time=2032] righteousness, but according to his mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the what?
[time=2040] Say it out loud. Holy Spirit, absolutely. It says in verse 6, "Whom he poured, a holy spirit,
[time=2049] whom he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior." One time, one time that happens,
[time=2059] you may hear people talking about a second baptism. No, there's no second baptism. Nobody gets more
[time=2068] of the spirit than you do. We all get the same amount. When we come to faith in Christ, we are
[time=2074] baptized. We are indwelt with the spirit of God. And what happens with the apostles here in Acts 2,
[time=2082] Steve mentioned this in all the gospels and even back into the Old Testament, the activity of the Holy Spirit. We see the Holy Spirit showing up on the scene many times, but when the Spirit shows up
[time=2093] prior to Acts 2, it's the spirit coming and doing some work, coming and engaging in some setting,
[time=2100] and then coming back. There is never prior to Acts 2 the indwelling, the baptism of the Spirit that
[time=2106] comes when somebody comes to faith. These guys knew the Lord. This is a unique deal. They had known the Lord. These apostles had surrendered completely their hearts and lives to him. It's
[time=2117] just that they hadn't received that baptism, that indwelling yet here in Acts 2, that happens.
[time=2125] Also here in Acts 2, we see the filling of the Spirit. And you and I have heard that phrase used
[time=2131] before. You and I have maybe read about that, the filling of the Spirit. And let me see if I can't
[time=2137] just distinguish for you the difference between the baptism or indwelling that takes place when you come to faith and being filled with the Spirit, which is really something that takes place
[time=2151] for you and for me as we go throughout our walk and our journey with him. Look with me at Ephesians 5.
[time=2157] Go there, if you will. Go to Ephesians chapter 5, and let's pick it up in verse 15.
[time=2165] Ephesians 5, 15. Let's talk about the filling of the Spirit. Therefore, it says in verse 15,
[time=2172] "Be careful how you walk." And that right there gives it away. This is not this filling of the
[time=2178] Spirit that he's about to discuss. This isn't about one coming to faith. This is about how one lives out their faith. He's talking about the way in which we walk, the way in which we live out in the day-to-day, our sanctification, our growing relationship with Christ. Therefore, be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of your time because the
[time=2200] days are evil. So then, verse 17, "Do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
[time=2208] And what's that? "Do not get drunk with wine," he says. "Do not be controlled by. Do not be
[time=2218] filled with. Do not come under the leadership of something other than the Spirit of God. Don't be
[time=2229] drunk. Don't be not sober. Be clear. Stay straight. Embrace that which is good and right and true.
[time=2238] Don't be drunk with wine for that is dissipation. But be," here's the will of God, "be filled with
[time=2246] the Spirit." Be filled with the Spirit. This here is describing, when you look at this in the Greek,
[time=2255] it's describing ongoing and habitual activity. This is something that you and I would choose to submit
[time=2261] ourselves to again and again and again. One in dwelling, many fillings. Don't be drunk with wine.
[time=2270] Don't be controlled by anger. Don't be controlled. Don't be drunk with jealousy. Don't be controlled
[time=2277] by frustration. Don't be drunk with regret. Don't be drunk with curiosity. Don't be controlled by
[time=2285] evil desire. I mean, the list goes on and on. The things that you and I can choose to give ourselves to that will, in essence, when allowed, control us. He says, "Don't do that." No. Be controlled by
[time=2299] make a choice to be filled with the Spirit. What an amazing study. That is just in and of itself.
[time=2307] Don't have the time this morning to get into all of that. But I want to just give you a glimpse.
[time=2311] Can I do that? Let me just give you a glimpse of what that could look like. I want you to see this in your life and mind. Being filled with the Spirit. I think you're going to have a slide. I want to
[time=2326] show this to you. What it looks like when we're filled with the Spirit. We are filled when we are filled with the Holy Spirit. There are some things that take place. Let me read this to you before we jump in there. Being filled with the Spirit is living in the conscious presence of the Lord
[time=2342] Jesus Christ. Letting his mind through the Word dominate everything that is thought and done. I'm
[time=2352] going to read that to you again. Being filled with the Spirit is living in the conscious presence
[time=2359] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Letting his mind through the Word of God dominate everything that is thought
[time=2367] and done. Everything that is thought and done. Look at this with me. When we are filled with the
[time=2374] Spirit. This is just from my own study. This is just from my own experience of the last 20-some years of knowing the Lord. This is from notes that I've taken along the way. This is from those who have invested in me. This is just a working list that I have and I'm familiar with
[time=2390] and I think is absolutely golden. You should hang on to this and give this some thought. When you're filled with the Spirit, not drunk with wine. Look what happens. We are controlled. We are filled with
[time=2401] the Spirit when we are controlled by the Word. Think of what controls you. Think of what it is
[time=2410] in your life that determines where you go and what you do and what you look at. What is it in your
[time=2417] life that controls you, that nudges you and prompts you. What is it that helps you make your plans?
[time=2425] What is it that guides you as you respond in a difficult situation? Think about what controls
[time=2432] your heart and mind. You and I can be filled with the Spirit when what controls us is the very Word
[time=2440] of God. It's an amazing truth and it's why I beg you and ask you and invite you every time I'm
[time=2447] almost with you to immerse yourself in, to spend time reading, to meditate, to memorize, to sing it,
[time=2454] to play it in the car, to have it be around you all the time, to feed it to your children,
[time=2460] to make it a central focal point of your time at home. Because when you are controlled by this,
[time=2468] my goodness, think of all the things in this world. Think of all the things in your life and mind that are trying to get control of your thinking and your mind. We're filled with the Spirit when
[time=2478] we're controlled by the Word. Next, when we are filled with the Spirit, we pursue purity.
[time=2484] I mean moral purity, yes. Appropriate moral relationships, yes. I also mean ethical purity.
[time=2492] We also mean relational purity. That which is good and true and right. See, when you're controlled
[time=2500] by the Word of God, it moves you toward pursuits that are pure. When we're filled with the Spirit,
[time=2508] we're controlled by the Word, we're pursuing purity. Next bullet point, write these down if you have
[time=2514] a pen, continuously confessing all known sin. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit,
[time=2520] watch how this works. We're controlled by the Word of God. It leads us to pursue pure paths
[time=2528] and with the Word of God in us and pursuing purity being our activity. All of a sudden, now we're sensitive like we didn't used to be. When we're not, when we're drunk with wine, when we're filled with anger, we're not sensitive to the things that we're doing or thinking that
[time=2544] are a violation of God's law, but now all of a sudden, filled by the Spirit, sin, all of a sudden
[time=2550] becomes blatant. Now when I say things or think things or do things or go places, all of a sudden,
[time=2556] boom, there it is, Spirit of God. And that leads me to an opportunity to be one who continuously.
[time=2565] Corbin gave us the privileged opportunity this morning to confess our sin. Was that the first
[time=2571] time you confessed sin today? Was it the first time you confessed sin this week? See, when we're
[time=2584] filled with the Spirit, we're led to a sensitivity towards sin that moves us to be, you say,
[time=2590] I'll be confessing sin all the time, every day, all week. Good. Do that. Be confessing your sin
[time=2598] every day, all week, all month, all the time. It's what happens when you're filled with the Spirit.
[time=2604] We're controlled by the Word. We pursue purity. We're continuously confessing sin. Next, it says,
[time=2611] dying to self. You know what happens when you're controlled by the Word? When you're pursuing pure paths and continuously confessing sin, God has your heart and your soul in a very good place.
[time=2624] And now all of a sudden, you start realizing how many opportunities you have in a given day to say,
[time=2630] you know what? You go first. You get the bigger cookie. I'll have the smaller one.
[time=2637] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me, let me, let me do that. I'd be happy to do that. I know a
[time=2643] week ago. I didn't want to do it because a week ago, I was filled with self. Now, I'm in a better
[time=2649] place. Now I'm filled with the Spirit. The Word is continually in me. I'm pursuing these days
[time=2655] pure paths and I'm ready. I'm sensitive to sin. I'm confessing it and it leads me to this place
[time=2661] where with my wife or my kids or my friends are those I bump into, I'd just like to serve you
[time=2669] dying to self, filled with the Spirit next. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit,
[time=2677] we surrender to God's will. Watch how this works. See, when the Word of God is controlling you and when you're pursuing purity morally and relationally and ethically and when there is this
[time=2690] continuous desire, not once every two weeks, but moment by moment, to make sure that you're in
[time=2696] right standing with him so you're confessing and you're dying to self as all of a sudden this other's centeredness begins to dominate your life. Then all of a sudden what you begin to realize
[time=2707] and sense is that there are some things that God would like you to do, things you never used to be aware of, things you were never really open to because you were filled with wine or you were filled with you or you were filled with something else. Now all of a sudden he's nudging you.
[time=2721] Now all of a sudden he's saying, "You know what? I've got some plans for you. I know you thought corporate America was your deal, but I've got some things I want you to do in ministry." Now all of a sudden God has this access to your heart and soul because you're so very open to him and he's saying, "You know what? I need you to break up with that guy. Don't be with that guy. Stop doing what you're doing with that guy because that guy and you and what's going on isn't bringing honor and glory to me." Now all of a sudden the Spirit of God, the will of God's beginning to be
[time=2750] much clearer to you as you think about the house that you're going to live in or the lifestyle you're going to lead or the friends that you're going to keep and then look at the last bullet
[time=2761] because sometimes then when we're nudged by the Spirit of God because we're filled with the Spirit
[time=2767] and all of a sudden we realize there are some things we need to do. There are some decisions we need to make. There are some convictions that we need to start standing on. All of a sudden we realize, "Oh my goodness, I can't do that alone. I need God's what? I need His power. I need His help."
[time=2783] When we are filled with the Holy Spirit we depend on His power in all circumstances.
[time=2790] That's just a good few things to think through there and I hope you'll write those down to that
[time=2801] whole list. There'll be available for you on the website this week. You can just resource it there
[time=2807] and you'll see that there are some things that we need to do. That's what we need to do.
[time=2812] What spiritual functions, what spiritual functions, there's the Holy Spirit fulfill in the life of a
[time=2820] genuine follower of Christ. Wow, this would be a two, three week deal. Let me just show you real
[time=2826] quick. I'll show you all about what spiritual functions are. What spiritual functions there's the
[time=2832] world. Wow, this would be a two, three week deal. Let me just show you real quick. I'll show you all this and we're going to go through it quick. I don't mean to. I don't expect that you're going to get all this. We can talk more about it later. But I wanted you this morning. I wanted you to see.
[time=2846] Many of us, some of you know this. A lot of you wouldn't be able to answer the question. For me
[time=2853] this week, as I looked at this again, I was amazed all over again. What are the functions of the Holy
[time=2859] Spirit in the everyday life of a believer? Can you name a few? I mean, just think about that.
[time=2867] Well, as you think about the few that you and I together could probably name, look at this.
[time=2870] Look at this list. The Holy Spirit is the baptismal agent, 1 Corinthians 12, baptismal agent. When
[time=2878] you and I come to faith in Christ, Christ baptizes us in the Holy Spirit. It's the Holy Spirit
[time=2884] at that point of regeneration that brings us into the body of Christ. He's the baptismal agent.
[time=2891] He calls people to ministry. He's the channel, the channel of divine revelation. God's truth and
[time=2898] God's word came to us through through pens and through prophets. That's true. But all of that was
[time=2904] directed by the who, the Holy Spirit. He is the divine channel of revelation. It's the Holy Spirit
[time=2910] who empowers us. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where as you got into the midst of it, you realized, my goodness, I am so far in over my head. I've no idea how I'm going to get through
[time=2922] this. I have no idea what I'm going to say. I have no idea how I'm going to respond in a way that somehow this isn't going to blow up in my face. And then you walk away going like,
[time=2934] "Who said that? Did I do that? How in the world did I find myself in that situation and somehow
[time=2942] come out of it?" The feeling is if I did the right thing, you were empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2948] The Holy Spirit empowers you, gives you strength, gives you courage. He fills us. We talked about
[time=2955] that. Next slide, ministry of the Holy Spirit. He guarantees our salvation. The Holy Spirit
[time=2961] guards us against many things. He helps us. He illuminates. The Holy Spirit brings to light
[time=2968] truth that is life-changing and eternity-altering. The Spirit of God brings to light. He illuminates.
[time=2976] He indwells. We talked about that. He intercedes. You know what? I was thinking about this first hour and I'm still feeling it second hour, so I wanted to say this to you. I think there's probably a few in the room this morning who aren't aware of the fact that the Holy Spirit of God
[time=2991] loves you so much and is so committed to your good. He so cares about your current situation.
[time=3001] He is so devoted to you being grown and nurtured and cared for that the Spirit of God
[time=3010] right now, it says in the Scriptures, is making intercession on your behalf to God.
[time=3016] You say to me sometimes, "Well, you pray for me," and I do. You say to your small group or your
[time=3022] class, "Well, you pray for me," and they do. You say to friends and family, "Hey, don't forget me this week. Lift me up in prayer," and they do. But don't ever forget that the Spirit of God
[time=3032] Himself, it says in Romans, makes intercession for you groans before the Father, it says for you,
[time=3040] often continuously. He loves you so much. Intercedes, produces fruit. Galatians 5
[time=3050] shows you the fruit of the Spirit. When someone lives a life not drunk with wine,
[time=3056] but instead filled with the Spirit that produces in their life love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
[time=3064] gentleness, self-control. The fruit of the Spirit is produced not by you, but by the Spirit of God.
[time=3070] He produces fruit. Next slide. You say there's another slide. Oh, yeah. He provides spiritual character. Galatians 5. He is the central agent of regeneration in your heart and life spiritually.
[time=3082] The Spirit of God regenerates that which was dead, that which was lifeless, that which was gone,
[time=3088] is made new, has given life through the Spirit of God. He restrains and convicts. You understand
[time=3095] conviction of sin when you say something, when you look at something, when you cop an attitude with your mom or dad, when you steal something, when you commit fraud with your income tax, when you
[time=3106] do whatever it is that you do, that violates God's law and down deep in your gut, you feel it. You
[time=3112] feel that? I know that that's wrong. That's the Spirit of God. And many times you and I
[time=3122] work really hard, really quick to blow right by that voice. That's the Spirit of God bringing
[time=3129] conviction of sin. He sanctifies us, makes us over time more like Christ. Oh, here's a great one.
[time=3137] He seals us. He seals us. Ephesians 1, I think it's Ephesians 1, 14. Yeah, write that one down.
[time=3146] Ephesians 1, 14. When you come to know Christ, when you truly and genuinely bow the knee of your
[time=3152] heart and you come to faith in Christ, the genuineness of that surrender is understood and sensed by God.
[time=3159] And he sends the Holy Spirit to seal that transaction. It's sealed like an envelope or the seal.
[time=3168] Can't mess with it. Can't take it away. Can't alter it. The Spirit of God seals you once and
[time=3177] for all. Is that it? No, I think there's more. The ministry of the Holy Spirit selects overseers,
[time=3184] guides in the selecting of overseers. He's the source of fellowship. It's the Spirit of God.
[time=3190] Think about this for a minute. There are so many of you in this room who shouldn't like me.
[time=3193] You shouldn't. You shouldn't like me. I've got too many issues. I've got too many hang ups.
[time=3200] We have too many different preferences. We like too many different things. There's no way really
[time=3206] that so many of you should like me and there's no way really I should like you, right?
[time=3212] But the fact is we don't just like each other. How does the body have fellowship? How do we
[time=3219] embrace each other? How do we get along? It's the Spirit of God in you and it's the Spirit of God
[time=3227] in me. It's the Spirit of God that brings fellowship and unity. It's the source of liberty, freedom,
[time=3234] source of power. We've talked about that source of unity, source of spiritual gifts, the gifts that God gave the body so the body could be built up, the gift of leadership,
[time=3244] the gift of teaching, the gift of encouragement, the gift of wisdom, the gift of discernment, the gift of helps. All of those gifts given divinely placed into your person so you can use it and
[time=3258] placed there by the Spirit of God. And he teaches, John 14, Acts 15, the Spirit of God teaches,
[time=3267] instructs, equips. Another slide? Just kidding you, that's it. All right, time to go. We'll get to
[time=3278] priority, timeless priority number one next week, I promise you. But I wanted to just remind you
[time=3284] this morning. This Holy Spirit thing is a very important truth and you and I need to understand
[time=3291] how it works, how it worked here in Acts 2 and what it means for you and I today as we have the
[time=3297] privilege of coming to know him, if you haven't done that, you have the privilege of coming to
[time=3303] know him, surrendering your heart and life to him and at that moment God promises to
[time=3309] indwell you with his Spirit. As we then walk in relationship with Christ through our days,
[time=3316] however many he gives us, we have the choice to make each and every moment of each and every day to be a people who would be filled with the Spirit and not with fill in the blank.
[time=3327] Why don't you stand and let's pray together. Father God, thank you for the time this morning.
[time=3337] There are many here this morning that you've brought back safely from time away and we pray
[time=3344] God that it was refreshing and renewing for them. God, there are many in the room this morning,
[time=3350] myself included who at times this past week have not been filled with the Spirit.
[time=3357] God, we've been filled with other things, other pursuits and other desires that have
[time=3367] moved us away from that which is true and right and good and we've confessed that to you
[time=3373] today and God we have been reminded of how sweet and right life is when we are filled
[time=3380] with the Spirit. Oh God, I pray for these friends of mine this morning as we leave this place. God,
[time=3386] I pray that they would make commitments again today. I know we keep making commitments and I know
[time=3393] you're honored by it. I know at times we get weary of it but oh God that we would make commitments again today to spend time with you to read what we need to read, to listen to what we need,
[time=3406] to listen to, to be exposed God to that which we need to be exposed to and that we wouldn't be
[time=3412] exposed God by our choice to that which we shouldn't be exposed to. God that we would make
[time=3418] decisions along the way that would allow us to be filled with your Spirit and not controlled
[time=3427] by lust, wine, anger, greed. Father we we long for that that filling and we long for the life
[time=3437] that it brings and we pray God this morning that you would give a strength to move in that direction
[time=3443] as we look forward to this study God prepare us individually and prepare us as a body
[time=3449] for these principles that even today we can still hang on to principles today that we can still give
[time=3456] ourselves to. Principles God from the early stages here in the book of Acts that we can embody with
[time=3464] your help as we want nothing more than to be engaged in that same endeavor to reach a lost and empty
[time=3470] world with the saving, life-changing, eternity-altering message of the gospel and we'll thank you for
[time=3478] it and your son's name and all the people agreed and said amen.
