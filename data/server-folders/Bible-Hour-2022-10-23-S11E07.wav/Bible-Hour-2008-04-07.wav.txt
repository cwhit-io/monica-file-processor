[time=60] Well hello again everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=62] We're thankful as always that you've tuned in, and I can't wait for you to see what we have for you today.
[time=69] I am so encouraged by what you'll be able to hear and see and take part of today.
[time=75] It's an amazing time that we've had this past week, and we've been studying what took place in thinking about what happened after Easter.
[time=84] And I just want to say this to you, you're going to hear today the first of three priorities that I believe the Book of Acts and the life and the ministry of the early church provides for us even today.
[time=98] I think there were some things that happened in the Book of Acts that maybe aren't necessarily prescriptive for us today, but I do believe there are some things that took place that provide for you in your local church wherever that might be, or for those of you who are a part of the Black Hawk family, a priority, a principle that we really should be today, not only adhering to but embracing deeply.
[time=122] And you'll hear today the very first one, and it is an amazing story of how God literally began his very first ministry in the very first church ever.
[time=134] And it has to do with you and I's willingness to be completely and absolutely willing and ready to be others centered.
[time=142] It has to do with you and I in our willingness to be not about us and not about our place and not even necessarily about our community.
[time=152] While those are things I think that do beat in the heart of God, I think this number one priority has so very much to do with your willingness in mind to be about people in other places, in other nations, where they speak other tongues, other languages.
[time=169] It is an amazing picture in Acts chapter 2 how God begins the very first ministry in the very first church, and it's about going.
[time=179] It's about going other places to other people.
[time=182] And I know many of you have been praying for us as we prepare to go as you watch this broadcast.
[time=188] I'll be in Nairobi, Africa in Kenya with a team of 10 from Blackhawk.
[time=195] And if you've been watching the Bible Hour, you know that God's been growing a heart in me and a heart in us here to be a people who would go and pass along God's compassion and God's love and God's justice.
[time=208] And we're trying our very best even now as you watch this to do that with the orphanage there in Nairobi. We've heard from many of you over the last few weeks, many of you offering to go with us in the future. And I want you to know we're very, very open to that.
[time=224] What we see here in Acts 2 I think is absolutely imperative.
[time=229] A missional church willing to go beyond its four walls to a world that desperately needs the hope and the promise of the gospel.
[time=237] So keep praying for us. Listen today. There may be some things for you as you think about your openness and your willingness in your own life to be one who moves beyond ourselves and goes into the world willing to care for and reach out to others.
[time=253] There may be some things for your church. There may be some things for your ministry. Be a people please who are willing to go and we'll look forward to seeing how God will use us as we give heart and effort to this first priority in the church after Easter in the book of Acts.
[time=272] Thanks for tuning in. God bless you.
[time=296] It was grace that taught my heart to free and grace
[time=308] my fears really how precious did that grace
[time=319] the hour I first beneath the chains are gone
[time=327] my chains are gone I've been set free
[time=334] like God my Savior has ground some need
[time=342] and like a flood it's for seeing the waves
[time=349] but ending love amazing praise. the Lord has brought us to me
[time=375] His Word my hopes if y'alls
[time=382] He will worship as long as life improves
[time=396] my chains are gone I've been set free
[time=403] my God my Savior has run some need
[time=410] and like a flood it's for seeing the waves
[time=417] and ending love amazing praise
[time=425] my chains are gone I've been set free
[time=432] my God my Savior has turned some need
[time=439] and like a flood it's for seeing the waves
[time=446] I've been set free
[time=465] the earth shall soon ease on like so
[time=472] the sun for bear to shine
[time=479] but God who's gone me here below will be
[time=488] forever mine will be forever mine
[time=500] you are forever mine
[time=512] hey as you can see on the stage this morning there are some doors and these doors are just a a representation if you will of some of the decisions some of the choices that we have to make that we get to make in life and the Bible speaks in John 10
[time=532] Jesus himself says I am the door in other places there in the gospel it talks about
[time=538] the gate and how there is a wide gate and a narrow gate this talk of gates and doors reminds us that there are decisions that we make doors that we walk through questions that get asked and thank God questions that get answered that allow us to move through doors at
[time=557] different stages at different places in life watch this morning I'm sure that in a room this size with this many people there are probably many of you here who can relate with some of the questions being asked some of the doors that are being faced some of the choices that need to be made we all have choices in life doors to go through or to shut
[time=585] some are little some are huge sometimes we have more than one door to choose
[time=591] from other times we have way too many doors to choose from
[time=599] this is my door I went through it when I was four years old you see my folks were Christians and they they did their best to model Christ for us I was their first child to get it after praying to let Jesus into my life I went to my mom and I asked
[time=621] mom how long is it going to take for him to get in there and is it going to hurt don't get me wrong my life has been tough
[time=634] you know how it is in life things just happen
[time=642] other times you bring things on yourself yet here I am daily making the choice to follow Christ
[time=654] no matter what here's my door it's one that I slam shut
[time=663] because you see I've already been through all of these other doors
[time=669] just hitting one brick wall right after the next when I was younger I didn't even think there was a god just to come to a dead end and shut that door then I realized I guess there must be a god he's just not the kind that's involved in every day sort of issues one more dead end and then I got to thinking what sort of a god is it who just wouldn't let everybody in I mean we all believe in something so what if we're Hindu or Buddhist or Muslim or Christian we are all believing in that same
[time=711] god right wrong one more shut door
[time=719] so now here I am at this latest door
[time=725] and I just can't help but think I'm never going to be able to work hard enough
[time=731] and I'm I am never going to be good enough
[time=737] to go through this so I've shut it this is the door that I've been facing since I was a kid
[time=749] I go to church every Sunday I was baptized when I was in high school and I gave on a regular basis but to be completely honest with you I feel like such a phony
[time=764] I walk in here with a big smile on my face and I tell you that I'm doing just fine yeah I'm doing great I'm just fine
[time=775] it's just that I know I'm supposed to be different being a Christian means that you're supposed to be really different and I'm not I know that I'm supposed to walk through this door I know I'm supposed to change and grow and be different but I don't want to because deep down inside I really don't want to be different so it's just me and this unopened door and I am fine so this is my door when I walked through with great hesitation
[time=809] I spent my life as a doubting skeptic wishy washy on whether I really needed
[time=815] a relationship with Christ I mean I was a good kid
[time=821] I rarely got into trouble and I was pretty self-sufficient I'm not like one of those people you know who who just hits rock bottom and needs a savior and I got to thinking I grasped the concept that if I believe in Jesus
[time=840] and he's not real I haven't lost anything but if I don't believe in him and he is real
[time=850] well then I've lost everything so I walked through that door I never looked back
[time=863] um hi there well I was here
[time=870] Easter Sunday morning it was my first time visiting and I sat up there I mean it just seemed like a really good place to blend in anyhow the message at morning was very thought-provoking oh okay it was an eye-opener for me I mean think about it Jesus really rose from the dead he did what he said he was going to do and the Bible it's true oh I left there I thought to myself whoa I have so much
[time=897] to learn and so many questions like what comes next and should I go back because I really want to find out I mean what am I missing here well this this is my door
[time=912] and I'm still standing here wondering should I go through it
[time=921] well what a great reminder for us this morning if you were here with us
[time=927] on Easter it was a it was a message that kind of left folks for the most part kind of having to consider three different responses and and we just want to continue to as the weeks go by give everybody here a chance to keep thinking about the responses the choices that we make in response to what God has done and what God has offered through his son Jesus Christ many of the doors that you just heard about maybe again represent some of the situations or circumstances that you've found yourself in I am so grateful for those who I know and I know several right now
[time=966] I know several who would be somewhere kind of along the lines of the gal who we saw up here who kind of just keeps trying to go through doors only to find brick walls keep they keep asking questions they keep trying to figure this thing out they keep engaging me and others in discussion I'm so thankful for those who keep knocking if you will revelation talks about the fact that the Lord he answers those who knock on that door and we want to be a place and we want to be a people that will encourage you and come alongside you as best we can as you continue to consider the door namely the door of Jesus Christ the doorway the gate to salvation
[time=1008] and we're so thankful that we get the opportunity week after week to tell you about that invite you to that and I'll tell you what an amazing privilege it is several in my life just recently have gone through this where they've had the joy of being able to now walk with those who have in recent days walked through that door that that redeeming saving door that that person and work of Christ door it's an incredible privilege and we're thankful for the chance that we get to point you in that direction well hey let me ask if you would to open your Bibles to the book of Acts we want to come back to this study and discussion that we've been in now just over the last couple of weeks it was a phenomenal resurrection sunday it was an amazing event for all of us
[time=1057] that called Black Hawk home we were so thankful for what we got to experience in the weeks leading up to that and so very grateful for the experience of that morning itself as we came away from that morning we began to ask the question what happened after Easter what was it that transpired what took place as you look through the pages of scripture as you follow the story of those faithful few that that ragtag band of Christ followers who found themselves now for the first time in three years without their leader what did they do where did they go how did God move how did they respond what happened after Easter and as we begin to look at that and as you begin to study that and you begin to dive into that you realize you know what there was a great deal that happened after Easter these are some exciting times these are some amazing times in the life of what was now just becoming the church and I tell you last week was a great opportunity for us to jump in and ask chapter two I want to read to you where we were last week before I read that to you though let me just ask you a couple questions when you're putting up when you're putting a new team together whatever team maybe it's a maybe you're coaching a little league team maybe you're putting a team together at work to to work on a project when you're putting a team together when you're when you've been given responsibility for oversight and leadership in an organization when you've been put in a situation where you're responsible for individuals and an endeavor and how that endeavor goes and where it goes and what it accomplishes when you've been put in charge what's one of the first things that that you consider when you're starting a family when you're starting a new company when you're starting a new church when you're starting any new endeavor as you think through the beginning stages of that one of the most important
[time=1173] most impactful most vital things you will do
[time=1179] and anybody who's ever done it will tell you one of the most powerful most vital most impactful things you'll do is the first thing that you do the first thing
[time=1193] that you do that first message that you deliver that first initiative that gets organized that first activity that first thing you do lays a foundation that will never go away
[time=1207] it establishes DNA and values and priorities the first thing you do when leading or giving yourself to any new
[time=1217] endeavor is quite possibly the most important thing you'll do and I want you to just keep that in mind as we jump back in here to the book of Acts let's just look briefly at where we were last week can we go with me if you would to Acts chapter two verses one to four says when the day of Pentecost had come
[time=1239] when the day of Pentecost had come they were all together in one place you'll remember that they were all together refers not just to the immediate 11 the apostles that had been with Christ now we're
[time=1253] talking about the faithful followers of Christ all of them that at that point in time probably numbered about 120 this is a 120 faithful followers of Christ who are now in this upper room doing what the Lord had told them to do which was wait they're waiting for the helper who was to come it's the day of Pentecost Jerusalem has absolutely swelled to probably oh close to four five six hundred thousand it's an amazing statistic I
[time=1285] read it this week Jerusalem in that day was at town with a population of about sixty thousand people when Pentecost took place again all all the Jews in any part of the then-known world all practicing Jews would make a pilgrimage back to Jerusalem experts say that somewhere between 250
[time=1307] to 500 thousand Jews are now coming back to Jerusalem
[time=1313] for this Pentecost celebration so what was normally at town of 60 thousand all of a sudden now has an extra 250 to 500 thousand people
[time=1324] there's people everywhere from every part of the then-known world on the day of Pentecost had come they were all together in one place and suddenly it says in verse two there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting and there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves and they these tongues of fire rested on each one of them and they were all filled all 120 of them were all
[time=1354] filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit was giving them utterance so we have all 120
[time=1365] apostles included in the upper room waiting the Holy Spirit comes upon them it says all 120 of them and they are both we learned this last week they are in that moment in this context in this setting they are both baptized with the Holy Spirit indwelt by him which you and I know now takes place when when anyone comes to faith in Christ when anyone fully surrenders their heart and life to him at that point of salvation we are indwelt by the Spirit they had known the Lord for a few years they had been serving him faithfully I believe they were redeemed prior to this but now is the point in time where Christ in this context where the Lord decides to bring the Holy Spirit baptized them Spirit indwels them and they are filled remember baptism and indwelling different than the filling of the Holy Spirit which takes place often throughout our lives they are both baptized and filled with the Spirit think about it there is now think about it there is now a first community of believers
[time=1437] there is now in that city of Jerusalem there is now at this point in that upper room the very first church remember church
[time=1449] not a building but people now in that upper room in Jerusalem and that day during Pentecost now the Spirit of God has come and now there is the very first recorded community of believers that are filled with the life and very nature of God the helper
[time=1467] that Jesus had promised and predicted would come had arrived and now we come my friends now we come to an unspeakably significant event now we come in our study of these early days now when we
[time=1481] asked the question so what did happen after Easter all my friends now we come to an event that is absolutely unbelievable when you look and think and consider the course that it's set for that very first church what you're about to witness what we're about to read and study this morning is the very first God ordained very first God inspired activity of the local church ever this what you're about to see this morning what we're about to look at is the very first endeavor that God engages his very first church in as it starts to be the church for the very first time think about how significant this was think about how important
[time=1531] this is God knew God knew that he had designed it this way he knew that the church he knew that these faithful followers of his and all who would follow after them you and me God knew as he begins this endeavor called the church
[time=1553] that they would be his only redemptive plan for a lost and searching world God knew from here on out he knew it would be the church he knew it would be the church with with with Christ as their head
[time=1567] don't forget that Ephesians 5 with Christ as their head he knew it would be the church who with Christ as their head and now empowered by the Holy Spirit Christ as the head empowered by the Holy Spirit
[time=1582] with a message now that is clearly articulated around this thing called the good news otherwise known as the what the gospel God knew that from here on out it would be the church that against all odds would carry out and and do his redeeming work and so with all of church history now just waiting we're at the we're at the press here we are next to at the precipice of all of church history now beginning to unfold
[time=1612] it's time so how so how is he going to kick it off so what's that first thing you do so what do you think his plan was
[time=1623] with all of that now getting ready to be rolled out how does God choose to move as he initiates for the very first time the activity of the local church what's he do does he start a chain of home groups in Jerusalem well you know what we he actually he actually does do that but it's not the first thing that we see does he have them build a building
[time=1651] that the first some some folks think you start a church that's the first thing you should do is build a building does God have them build a building no does he establish a program throughout Jerusalem to feed the poor and hungry no no that comes later as well but it's not the first thing that we see him do is he start a men's Bible study or a women's Bible study or a new members class good things great endeavors helpful to many today is that the first thing we see him doing here no no here it is the very first recorded ministry
[time=1690] endeavor in the very first church ever is
[time=1696] he helps them reach out he helps them reach out to people who were different
[time=1703] than they were it's the very first thing he does I know it sounds simple he helps them minister the very first thing is that he helps them minister to people who lived in different places and spoke different languages and came from different cultures very first thing he does is that he takes these faithful few
[time=1731] and in a supernatural unbelievable pretty remarkable turn of events
[time=1737] helps them understand that from the very beginning this thing was going to be about them people different than they look at acts two five to 13
[time=1753] priority number one the first church and it's three timeless priorities here's priority number one look at acts two verses five to 13 now there were Jews living in Jerusalem at this time during Pentecost development from every nation under heaven
[time=1769] I love how it says that it just gives you more of a flavor and more of a feel for what it was like in Jerusalem at this time and it was all God ordained he knew exactly what he was doing he knew what this first endeavor was going to be he knew the foundation that he was going to lay for the church in the future and Jerusalem's packed with every with development from every nation under heaven
[time=1796] and when this sound occurred now referring back to acts two one to four the sound of the rushing wind the sound of the holy spirit coming and when the sound occurred the crowd came together and were bewildered because each one of them what now now each one of the crowd was now hearing the followers of Christ
[time=1819] who had who had been given the the holy spirit and in and in this case it says in verse four they had been given tongues as the spirit was giving them utterance
[time=1830] so each one of them was hearing them speak verse six in his own language all the people in Jerusalem this amazing crowd gathers around this
[time=1843] upper room the 120 begin to make their way down into the street speaking other languages they were amazed and astonished saying why
[time=1855] are not all these who are speaking Galileans and how is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born
[time=1864] Parthians and Medes and Elomites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontius and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene and visitors from Rome both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs we hear them in our own tongues
[time=1885] speaking of I love this the mighty deeds of God and that's what tongues that's what tongues was that's why God gave the gift of tongues I don't know what your history is with tongues I don't know what your understanding is of the spiritual gift of tongues don't know how you've been taught or how you view that I just want to remind you right here that the gift of tongues was given in the public sense the gift of tongues was given so that the gospel could be spread so the mighty deeds of God could be communicated to people all over the then-known world by 120 folks who had no physical or natural capacity
[time=1927] to communicate to the then-known world does that make sense?
[time=1932] Tongues was a language tongues was discernible tongues was the gift that God gave those individuals to speak that guy's language who was from the Arabian region from the Pamphylia region from the Cretan region I mean this was an amazing an amazing statement by God priority number one first priority we see here in the local churches the
[time=1959] priority you've heard a state before the priority of going and what we mean by going we mean a physical going but almost or even more importantly than a physical going my friends it's a mindset that's willing to go it's a mindset and a heart that's aimed at and pointed toward always aimed at and pointed toward others what God does here my friends as you see this unfold the very first thing God does with this ragtag but faithful and willing body of believers is give them languages to speak so that the gospel the truth about God could go to others the first ministry if you want to write this down the very first ministry endeavor of the first local church ever was missions it was missions we call it missions the very you might can call it some other
[time=2018] things you know the very first thing God did was mission ministry missions mission ministry here here
[time=2027] here's the deal taking what you've been given this is what mission ministry is taking what you've been given taking taking what's been deposited in you spiritually taking the blessings and the gifts that God's given you taking this transformation that God has worked in you it's taking what you've had the privilege of receiving and going across the street going across town going across the country going across the world
[time=2057] mission ministry is a mindset that's followed by activity that's all about your willingness in mind to go and to offer and to give to not sit to not settle to not stay to not hunker down
[time=2072] and the very first thing God does with the very first church the very first
[time=2078] time out of the gate is he delivers a message and let me just give you just real simple i know but i want to just give you three things i think it's a clear message that God delivers it's a clear message that gets communicated to this very first church and my friends i think it's a message that still is being communicated it's still a message that you and i need to that we must hear and not just understand but embrace today very first message God delivers to a brand new church number one it's not ever going to be about you very first thing that gets communicated as God does this amazing act with these
[time=2121] faithful 120 is he clearly communicates it is not ever going to be just
[time=2129] about you that's consistent with our lord right our lord wasn't about himself our
[time=2138] christ the head of the church and now as the new church begins to move down this road the very spirit the very attitude that God wants to give it is the attitude of his son who in mark 1045 said i i came what does it say mark 1045 for even the son of man did not come to be served but to what say it out loud to serve to serve
[time=2161] that's that's a that's a missional word it's a missional picture christ didn't exist to get christ existed to give you and i as we follow christ our mindset
[time=2175] and our heart should be that which leads us to a kind of living and a kind of choosing that isn't about us it's not about us getting it's about us giving it's not about us sitting it's about us going it's about us and our minds and our hearts being postured toward others that guy across the room right now
[time=2197] that gal across the street that family across town it's just a mindset it's a spirit that that i believe dwells in you with the spirit of god dwells in you it's the spirit that was in christ that made his whole existence be about giving
[time=2215] this quality in jesus was to now characterize the church and unselfish unrelenting willingness to move beyond comfort
[time=2225] how you doing there because it's not about you it's not about your comfort it's not about that which is familiar
[time=2237] this is a spirit that he that he places into the very first endeavor of the church and unselfish and relenting willingness to move beyond comfort and the unfamiliar and the familiar so that others could be served here in x2 god shows them that his kingdom moving forward was going to involve other zip codes and you and i think about it now we look back and go well yeah no kidding what but they didn't they had no idea what was going to happen imagine the state that they were in they had no clue what his plan was they had no idea where he was going to go but what he shows them and what he communicates to them right out of the gate is that this is going to be about people from other places other tongues other nations other tribes other cultures they would need to now think global not just local the church was going to be inclusive please hear that the church was going to be inclusive Pamphylia you're in Egypt you're in sirene you're in
[time=2301] Christians and Arabs you're in it wasn't going to be about them it was going to be about others what a message he delivers
[time=2314] the very first message god delivers to a brand new church is it's not ever going to be just about you it's always going to be about others you know steve longbreak a few weeks ago took us to ax one eight would you go back there i i think maybe as this begins to unfold for them maybe as the hundred and twenty are now speaking languages they didn't know now is the hundred and twenty are facing a city full of people from other places and other tongues who are now coming to faith in christ maybe now the one hundred and twenty are starting to realize how clear he really was back in ax one eight look what he said in ax one eight it says but you will receive this is great but you will receive what say it out loud and how did they receive power they receive power when they were indwelt by the who say it holy spirit watch this he tells him back in one eight this is just a short time prior to that he says but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and right after that right after the holy spirit comes upon you that line and you shall be my what say it out loud now the holy spirit had come upon them in this upper room and now before they know it they're being what say it witnesses witnesses representatives of the gospel and not only will you be
[time=2400] witnesses right there in your own little world he said but oh no no no hang on you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth
[time=2416] see it was always in the plan it was never going to be just about them it was always going to be about others jesus himself in the great commission many of you know that he said in Matthew 28 he said go into all the what the world they heard him say it I think probably this was all starting to come back to them acts one eight Matthew 28 God's design for his kingdom to move forward is the church and his design for the church my friends has always been
[time=2448] for it to reach out his design for the church has always been for it to extend
[time=2456] itself his design for the church has always been for it to go and serve others remember remember God's redemptive plan has always been from the very very beginning let's just go back just briefly you go back to the beginning of his relationship with the people of Israel you go back to God's original redemptive plan with the Israelites and his plan was always for the Israelites to be this distinct and different people whose love for God was great and deep and in their deep love and devotion to God and in their willingness to obey God God wanted them to be a light that would shine to all the different what nations it's always been on God's heart redemption
[time=2502] for those not just here but redemption for those who are over here it's always been on his heart he always wanted to have priests
[time=2513] that would what go and pass along God to others well
[time=2519] Israel drops the ball Israel drops the ball again and again and again and finally God says that's it I'm going to do this differently I'm going to initiate this amazing thing called the church the body of my son the body of Christ
[time=2537] and I just want you to sense it and I just want you to see it this morning but nothing's changed in the heart of God it had from the very beginning of this church endeavor the very first thing we see is he wants there to be a willingness to move beyond ourselves he wants there to be a willingness for us to be inclusive not exclusive it's why I listen it's why I always I think I have for years I think early on in my life and early on in my ministry opportunity I think maybe it bothered me a little bit I'll tell you what now today it bothers me a great bit now I am very bothered I'm very saddened when I see a church that's all that's all rich
[time=2585] I get bothered when I see a church that's all white I get bothered when I see a church that's all black bothers me it saddens me when I see a church that's all brown or Hispanic or A and I know sometimes I understand in some places in some contexts it needs to be that way my point is this the more and more I understand the heart of God for the church the more and more I understand how from the very beginning it was to be about inclusiveness not exclusiveness the more and more I understand and see the beauty of diversity and the beauty of the body of Christ and all that you bring and all that you bring and all that you offer the more and more I see the diversity of the Arabs and the Phrygians and the folks from Pamphilia and the people from Jerusalem I go wow what a picture it saddens me when I just see a church that's just this
[time=2646] and if you're in this I love you I'm glad you're this I just wish there was I wish there was more a broader deeper representation of all that's out there you know what the cool thing is in Jerusalem when this all went down and you'll see it as you keep reading in Acts and I hope you're reading in Acts daily as you read on in Acts the next big deal that goes on is Peter preaches the first message ever he sets quite a bar 3000 people come to Christ in the very first message ever
[time=2684] but this is the cool part the 3000 most of whom were there on the pilgrimage right most of these folks these are Jews who had come back now they get converted they bow the knee of their heart to the true Messiah you have 3000 people who now get saved and again most scholars will tell you that most of them didn't go back to where they had come from most of them now stay in Jerusalem the church of 120 now goes to 3120 and all of a sudden they're
[time=2717] living together and they're sharing meals together and they're they're giving goods to each other as anyone might have need and now the Arab and the and the Phrygian and the the Pamphylian and the Cretan they're all there together
[time=2733] and it's an amazing picture of this body of Christ people from what did it say early on from from every nation under heaven
[time=2743] together not caring not worrying about the color
[time=2749] of their skin the accent that they carried the the place of their ancestors none of it
[time=2761] it's not ever going to be about just you it's always going to be about others and lastly you can just write this down if you if you follow those two they will always think you're drunk people will people will think if you and I live this way they will they're it will undoubtedly confuse some if you really live if the church really
[time=2790] functions this way they will undoubtedly at times think we're absolutely nuts that we would be that inclusive that we would let them in and we would fellowship with him that we would go down the street and serve her and yet it's what our Lord did again and again and again our Lord confounded them he absolutely confused them because of his graciousness and his kindness his missional spirit that took what he'd been given and he gave it to others and if he had to travel he traveled and if he had to walk across the village he walked across the village we're going to Nairobi on on Thursday
[time=2836] it's incredible to me we were talking as a team yesterday I heard several folks say that they've had people say to them you're nuts what are you going to Kenya for these days didn't they just have riots and
[time=2850] unrest didn't it just get all crazy over there just a month or so ago what are you doing what are you thinking some here that we're going to be working with you know HIV babies and and unsettled you know neighborhoods and with people who are physically and emotionally you know hurting and they think well what do you do you put yourself at risk what are you thinking they say these kinds of things they had somebody even had somebody who I somebody who I know somebody who I trust say to me
[time=2883] a couple months ago what a bad idea it was for us to go to Nairobi
[time=2889] what a bad idea it was for us to invest this much time and resource
[time=2895] into something that in their words at the end of the day really wouldn't provide much bang for our buck and I thought you know you you just you've completely missed it first of all this isn't about a buck in Matthew 25
[time=2914] Jesus said to some people who were confused he had said you know to them that when you when you fed me when you gave me water to drink when you clothed me when you visited me in prison remember that exchange and they're going wait a minute when did we ever you know that's how I know your mind when you did that and they said when did we ever do that to you and he says when you did that to the who to the least of these I'm gonna go hold babies for 10 days
[time=2942] and I might get to do a few other things and I'm going to get to feed them and I'm going to get to encourage those who give their lives to that very endeavor there will be little ones coming into that orphanage rescued from a garbage pit that day while we're there
[time=2959] we'll get to visit the slums we'll get to connect with people who are now engaged in church ministry in the very heart of nairobi I can't wait and it is a sacrifice
[time=2971] I don't like being gone from my family for 10 days I don't like being gone from you for 10 days the folks who are going to join me here on the stage in just a moment it's a huge sacrifice and and hear me and there are babies
