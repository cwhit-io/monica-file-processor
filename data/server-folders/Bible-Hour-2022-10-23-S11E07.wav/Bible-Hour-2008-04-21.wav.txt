[time=79] There are the meadows, there still the woodlands,
[time=90] golden the blue bean,
[time=96] the heart of sin. Jesus is fairer,
[time=107] Jesus is pure, the day of life all hard to see.
[time=120] All right, sing, you are fairer.

[time=336] Oh, he who here, now to his temple, join him, join him,
[time=347] and let adoration.
[time=354] It's a praise to the Lord.
[time=357] Praise to the Lord, who O Lord, thank so wondrously brave.

[time=543] [AMEN] Hi, my name is Sarah Sumner and I'm 19 years old.
[time=550] I go to IPFW and I'm majoring in secondary education.
[time=556] Dancing for him is important to me because in Psalm it says, "Let them praise his name with dancing." Dancing is a big part of who I am.
[time=564] I want to use this gift for him as an offering and expression for my Savior.
[time=571] I was sure by now that you would have reached down and wiped our tears away.
[time=579] Stepped in and saved the day.
[time=583] But once again, I say, "Man, and it's still raining."
[time=592] And as the thunder rolls, I barely hear you whisper through the rain.
[time=600] I'm with you.
[time=604] And as your mercy falls, I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away.
[time=617] And I'll praise you in the storm and I will lift my hands for you are who you are.
[time=626] No matter where I am and every tear I've cried or you hold in your hands,
[time=635] you never left my side and though my heart is torn.
[time=643] I will praise you in the storm.
[time=653] I remember when I stumbled in the wind.
[time=658] You heard my cry to you and raised me up again.
[time=664] But my strength was almost gone.
[time=667] How can I carry on if I can't find you?
[time=674] And as the thunder rolls, I barely hear you whisper through the rain.
[time=682] I'm with you.
[time=686] And as your mercy falls, I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away.
[time=699] And I'll praise you in the storm and I will lift my hands for you are who you are.
[time=708] No matter where I am and every tear I've cried or you hold in your hands,
[time=717] you never left my side and though my heart is torn.
[time=725] I will praise you in the storm.
[time=733] I lift my eyes unto the hills. Where does my help come from?
[time=739] My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
[time=745] I lift my eyes up to the hills. Where does my help come from?
[time=751] My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
[time=770] I'll praise you in the storm and I will lift my hands for you are who you are.
[time=778] No matter where I am and every tear I've cried or you hold in your hands,
[time=787] you never left my side and though my heart is torn.
[time=796] I will praise you in the storm and I will lift my hands for you are who you are.
[time=826] I chose this song "Praise You in the Storm" because we have and will be in storms and if
[time=842] we know his peace then there is nothing to worry about.
[time=848] I want to introduce to you and Kelly's absence, Jeff Carroll.
[time=851] This is Jeff from Union Church in Huntington and he got to be here with us just a few months
[time=858] ago almost for our good Friday service and if you were here you got to meet Jeff then.
[time=864] I'm excited about what God has to share through you this morning and so please welcome Jeff as he shares today.
[time=876] It's so exciting to be with you this morning in June of 2004.
[time=883] The Lord brought my family from Paducah, Kentucky and I remember when Huntington, Indiana,
[time=891] called and I said, "Dear Lord, where is that at?" I was serving in my home church was the church about this size.
[time=898] I was the associate pastor there and got the call one day and it wasn't, you know, I'm
[time=906] thinking, "Okay, we'll go south, you know, we'll go to Florida where it's really warm
[time=912] all the time," but God had other plans and so he brought us in June of '04.
[time=918] About two years ago I met a gentleman named Kelly Bird and we started talking, we continued
[time=929] talking and then the last year probably here in this town he's probably my best friend.
[time=940] We have just, we share philosophies and ministry together.
[time=946] We want to see this community, this region reach for Jesus Christ and this last year I
[time=953] don't know what I'd have done without him and hopefully he can say the same thing and who knows what the Lord has in store for us in the future.
[time=960] We just, he is, he comes to our campuses some and this is my first opportunity to be here
[time=966] and it's just an honor and a privilege but you've got a great pastor and I am just honored
[time=973] to be able to call him my friend.
[time=976] So thank you for this opportunity today.
[time=980] We in church, like I said, we started there four years ago almost now and it is out in
[time=989] the middle of nowhere.
[time=990] If you don't have a Tom Tom, you ain't gonna find it, you just ain't gonna find it.
[time=995] It is in the middle of nowhere and, you know, I come from a church like this and I'm a city
[time=1001] guy and it's like my Lord has a sense of humor.
[time=1006] And I drove up on that place, I said, no, it's my Lord's got a sense of humor.
[time=1010] So we go there and Lord worked it out, that that's where he wanted us to be.
[time=1018] And through that, here we are.
[time=1020] We, God has blessed us tremendously.
[time=1023] We now have four services on the weekend.
[time=1025] We started another campus in January in town.
[time=1030] We have services on Saturday night, two on Sunday morning and then I will do another one tonight in our in town campus.
[time=1036] And the Lord's just blessed and people will come to know Jesus Christ, which is the ultimate thing that God has called us to do and so just continue to pray for us and we're gonna
[time=1048] pray for you and just look forward to what God's getting ready to do.
[time=1054] Have you ever been lost in that awful feeling to be lost?
[time=1061] So one of the things I tell my group is we'll just stop right here and I'll tell you.
[time=1066] This sermon can be really long or it can be really short.
[time=1070] It's up to you guys.
[time=1072] If you talk to me, it's gonna be really short.
[time=1075] If you get into it today, it's gonna be really short.
[time=1077] If you don't, man, it's gonna be really long.
[time=1080] So knowing that, have you ever been lost?
[time=1086] You're getting it, you're getting it.
[time=1091] And when you're lost, it's just an awful feeling, isn't it?
[time=1095] I mean, I gotta ask my rhetorical questions here.
[time=1107] And when you're lost, it's like, how am I gonna get out of here?
[time=1114] I've been lost really one time that I can think of and it was when I was younger and
[time=1120] we had motorcycles and my friend said he knew where he was going, so I follow him.
[time=1125] And then all of a sudden we stop and he looks around and I thought, oh my, we're lost.
[time=1133] I think the good Lord before dark, we got out of there, but it was just an awful feeling.
[time=1139] But one of the things I realized from that is unless you've been lost, you don't know
[time=1149] the true need to come home until you've been lost.
[time=1155] You don't appreciate home until you've truly been lost.
[time=1162] In our text today, we're gonna discover four parables of a lostness.
[time=1169] So if you have your bibles, let's turn to Luke chapter 15 verse 1.
[time=1184] I love to hear the bibles, it's awesome.
[time=1187] It'll be up on the screen too.
[time=1189] Luke chapter 15 verse 1, "Now the task collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear him.
[time=1197] But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered.
[time=1201] This man welcomed sinners and eats with them.
[time=1203] Can you imagine that?
[time=1206] Here Jesus is.
[time=1208] People are eager to hear about him and eager to see if he's a real deal and then we got church folk out talking about it.
[time=1216] Religious people.
[time=1217] I'll say, I can't believe Jesus hanging around with them people.
[time=1220] I cannot believe this, I can't believe that he'd want to hang around.
[time=1224] What about us Lord?
[time=1226] What about us?" Sound familiar.
[time=1231] Then Jesus told them, this parable, "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them.
[time=1237] Does he not leave the 99 in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?
[time=1242] And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home.
[time=1247] Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, "Rejoice with me, I have found my lost sheep." I tell you that in the same way, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who do not need to repent.
[time=1263] The first one is, he uses the parable of a sheep.
[time=1267] I don't know a lot about sheep being raised in the city except when I started to discover
[time=1275] this about sheep is when they're in a pack, what happens is they start eating.
[time=1282] They start nibbling and one of them will nibble away and then when he gets done and gets
[time=1289] full, he looks back and there's no one there.
[time=1294] The other sheep are gone.
[time=1298] I find it interesting that Jesus said that I'm going to leave 99 and go after the one.
[time=1307] Us church people would think, "Hey, if 100 people came and we kept 99 out of 100, man,
[time=1314] we would think we were doing great." Jesus says, "No, that's not good enough.
[time=1321] I want you to go after the one." See, you know why, hey, let's just be honest here this morning.
[time=1325] You know why we don't go after the one?
[time=1328] Because it's messy.
[time=1332] It's messy, isn't it?
[time=1333] Because why? because they don't dress like we do, they don't act like we do, they don't
[time=1340] have the churchy words, they're going to consume our time.
[time=1345] Well, they're just not going to get it anyway.
[time=1350] Jesus said, "No, that's not the attitude I want." See, man has put that attitude into the church, but that's not the attitude of Jesus Christ.
[time=1358] Jesus Christ said, "I love this one.
[time=1361] Go after them." I don't care what you have to do.
[time=1365] See when them sheeps, when they nibble away and when they go off, what happens is a lot
[time=1371] of times before they can find their way back home, they get really messy.
[time=1374] They get really dirty.
[time=1375] And so when you pick them up, that suit's going to get stained.
[time=1380] That pretty dress is going to get messed up.
[time=1383] This stainless glass windows are not going to look the same.
[time=1386] When you go after the one, it will take you places that you really don't want to go.
[time=1391] But Jesus says, "I'm not asking you to be comfortable.
[time=1394] I'm asking you to go and seek and save that which was lost."
[time=1401] He didn't call this church to be comfortable.
[time=1404] He called us to go and reach that one.
[time=1408] We have a lot of them wounds in our church.
[time=1411] Most of the people that we are reaching are a lot of people that's been out of church.
[time=1415] And they're coming to no cross.
[time=1417] But guess what?
[time=1418] That's just the beginning.
[time=1420] They still have some things that we have to address and that we have to work with them on.
[time=1424] And the easiest thing to do is just say, "Hey, go away.
[time=1428] It's okay.
[time=1429] I did my best." No.
[time=1431] Because it's somebody's dad.
[time=1432] It's somebody's mom.
[time=1434] It's somebody's son and daughter.
[time=1436] You know who they are in your family.
[time=1438] We can't give up.
[time=1439] We must go after them.
[time=1446] We need to get back what Satan has stole.
[time=1451] Verse 8 "Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one.
[time=1457] Does she not lot of the lamp sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
[time=1462] And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, "Rejoice with me.
[time=1468] I have found my lost coin." In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God.
[time=1476] Over one sinner who repents.
[time=1480] Here's the parable that Jesus lays out of the lost coin.
[time=1484] This lady has lost one day's wage.
[time=1489] Now for you and I, that's a pretty big deal.
[time=1491] It was a big deal to her.
[time=1493] So she is sweeping her house.
[time=1496] She is looking everywhere because something is lost.
[time=1499] You know in our life, a lot of times we lose our direction.
[time=1503] We lose our priorities in life.
[time=1506] And we start swaying off in the wrong direction and we lose who God created us to be.
[time=1513] We lose who God created the church to be.
[time=1516] There is no plan B.
[time=1518] God says, "We're it.
[time=1520] He wants to use us.
[time=1522] We lose our direction.
[time=1523] We get so caught up in what we want to do and not what Scripture wants us to do.
[time=1528] We lose our direction." So she sweeps, I don't know about you, but my wife and family are here and I got a lot
[time=1539] of church family here and I thanked them for being here today.
[time=1542] But if my wife loses her wedding ring, you think, when she comes and tells me, you think
[time=1550] I'm going to say, "Now honey, let's just find a convenient time to do this.
[time=1557] Let's just sit down.
[time=1558] We'll get to it later." Hey, we're tearing up the house, man.
[time=1563] I mean, we are going and going until we find that ring because when mom is not happy, yeah.
[time=1575] That is for sure in my house.
[time=1578] So we, I mean, we are finding that ring.
[time=1582] She is trying to find what she's lost and then when she finds it, they celebrate.
[time=1589] The church of today needs to celebrate more.
[time=1594] It just happened in our church even four years ago when I remember the very first person that came to know Jesus Christ.
[time=1601] Our church goes to their feet and celebrates because the Scripture says the angels in heaven will celebrate.
[time=1608] You think they celebrate on their blessed assurance?
[time=1612] Y'all ain't with me, are you?
[time=1618] Do you think they just sit down there and say, "Well, it's just wonderful?"
[time=1624] Because they truly understand the sacrifice that was made by our Christ.
[time=1629] They know what He did.
[time=1631] We need to, some of us have been home so long, we forgot what it's like to be lost.
[time=1642] Verse 11, "Jesus continued, 'There was a man who had two sons.
[time=1647] The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.'
[time=1653] So he divided his property between them.
[time=1656] No longer after that, the younger son got together, all he had set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth and while living.
[time=1665] After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country and he began to be in need.
[time=1672] So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country who sent him to the fields to feed pigs.
[time=1679] He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating but no one gave him anything.
[time=1684] I'm going to stop right there and just say this.
[time=1689] When Satan gets done with you, you might have won well of a time and I'm going to tell you,
[time=1695] if you're far from God and you know better this morning and you've been doing things that you know you shouldn't be doing, when he gets done with you, nobody wants you.
[time=1705] Not even the pigs.
[time=1707] What do you remember that?
[time=1710] When he came to a census, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare and here I am starving to death.
[time=1718] I will set out and go back to my father and say to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
[time=1724] I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
[time=1727] Make me like one of your hired men.' So he got up and went to his father.
[time=1732] But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion
[time=1738] for him.
[time=1739] He ran to his son through his arms around him and kissed him.
[time=1743] The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
[time=1747] I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' But the father said to his servants, 'Quick, bring the best robe and put it on him.
[time=1756] Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
[time=1758] Bring the fatty calf and kill it.
[time=1760] Let's have a feast and celebrate.
[time=1762] For this son of mine was dead and is alive again.
[time=1766] He was lost and he is found.' So they began to celebrate.
[time=1770] Meanwhile, the older son was in the field.
[time=1772] When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.
[time=1775] So he called one of the servants and asked him, 'What is going on?' Your brother has come, he replied, 'And your father has killed the fatty calf because he has him back safe and sound.' The older brother became angry and refused to go in.
[time=1790] So his father went out and pleaded with him, but he answered his father, 'Look, all these years I have been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders, yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.'
[time=1805] But when this son of yours has squandered your property with prostitutes, comes home, you kill the fatty calf for him.
[time=1813] This is the lost son.
[time=1815] This son knows he's lost, knows what he's doing is wrong, but see, the greatest thing
[time=1825] about this is the father laid the foundation that he needed.
[time=1831] So he had a reference point to come back to.
[time=1836] Mom and Dad, I have a 22-year-old and a 20-year-old.
[time=1842] I have done the very best I can to lay the foundation.
[time=1846] Now they have to make their own choices.
[time=1849] Mom and Dad, you're the same way.
[time=1850] If you still have kids at home, you are their example.
[time=1856] Lay the foundation where they have a reference point to come home to.
[time=1864] And when he come home, immediate forgiveness was given to him.
[time=1872] Not this.
[time=1873] I can't believe you did this, or I can't believe where you been.
[time=1876] I can't believe you squandered away all this wealth.
[time=1878] None of that.
[time=1880] It was, "Son, welcome home." Not only did he welcome him home, he celebrated 14-years-old.
[time=1896] I got up one morning and it was my birthday, and I was the only child, and I was excited
[time=1906] about the day, and my mom said, "I need to talk to you."
[time=1914] And I said, "Okay." And I said, "What's wrong, mom?" And she said, "I just want you to know that I'm leaving your dad today."
[time=1925] And she said, "I just need some time away."
[time=1931] And so on my first, 14th birthday, all I seen was the back of her walk out of our house.
[time=1940] It rocked my world.
[time=1946] Through that time, I became a very angry person, and I still went to church.
[time=1950] I mean, I was at church.
[time=1951] My dad took me every time the doors were open.
[time=1956] But I became very bitter.
[time=1958] How can someone I love so much do this to me?
[time=1962] Choose my life.
[time=1966] I met Laurie, and we got married, and still a very bitter person.
[time=1975] The first seven years of our marriage was literal hell on earth, and it was because
[time=1982] of me, because I never did really forgive mom.
[time=1987] At 19-years-old, I got an unbelievable job with a drug wholesale company, and did that
[time=1993] for about five to six years, and then one day a multi-millionaire called me and wanted me to run his medical company.
[time=2000] I was only 25 years-old.
[time=2003] He gave me a huge increase in salary.
[time=2006] I traveled the world, had limo to limos, had a driver, had it all.
[time=2011] I had everything that the world had to offer.
[time=2015] And one day, I felt the Lord tugging at my heart, asking me to come home.
[time=2025] I didn't do it.
[time=2026] I went on, and it was about six months or so later.
[time=2032] I'm down at this place called Meghan Airs Island and the Keys, and I'm at this restaurant,
[time=2039] this most beautiful restaurant I've ever been to in my life.
[time=2042] The only way in is by helicopter or boat, we came in by helicopter, and I'm eating.
[time=2048] And all of a sudden, I'm eating clam chowder, and all of a sudden, I get sick.
[time=2054] I mean, sick, sick.
[time=2056] You have all these stars at this place, and I'm getting sick.
[time=2061] I'm thinking, "What am I going to do now?" So I run to the bathroom, and I just tell them, I said, "I've got to go." So I go back to the condo that we're staying at, and it was probably about 500 feet to the ocean, and I just continually, profusely started continually vomiting.
[time=2083] Then they fly me back, long story short, they fly me back to Paducah.
[time=2089] I'm in the hospital for 30 days.
[time=2094] And in all that, when I wanted to throw up my hands in my marriage because I was so
[time=2101] frustrated and I was so mad, I had a wife that would not quit praying for me.
[time=2109] She could write the book, "Pryver, Praying Wife." That was her.
[time=2113] She knew that God had a plan for my life.
[time=2116] She wouldn't give up, even when I told her to leave.
[time=2123] After that, I'm in the hospital for 30 days, continually vomiting.
[time=2126] The only thing keeping me alive is IVs.
[time=2129] My heart starts to fibrillate, and they put me in ICU.
[time=2132] Had a doctor come in one Sunday morning, he said, "Jeff, we've done all we can do.
[time=2137] We're going to have to send you to mail or Vanderbilt you choose."
[time=2143] He walks out the door.
[time=2147] I'm laying there, flat on my back, in my 20s, and I said, "Okay, God, you got me."
[time=2160] Signed myself out and went to church that night.
[time=2165] Laid myself on the altar.
[time=2167] I said, "God, I need to come home.
[time=2172] I know you have a plan for my life.
[time=2175] I know I've rejected it and rejected it and rejected it, but I know I need to forgive my mom, and then I know you want me in the ministry."
[time=2187] At that moment, I instantly stopped vomiting.
[time=2191] I never did have to go anywhere else, regain my health right back.
[time=2199] When God has a plan for you, his way is so much better than your way.
[time=2207] May I say to you this morning that if I wouldn't have went through that experience, I might
[time=2216] not worship like I do today.
[time=2219] I might not be where I am today.
[time=2222] I may not really understand true forgiveness anymore like I used to.
[time=2227] If I wouldn't have went through that, I don't know that I would be the person that I am today.
[time=2237] When you've been to hell and back, when you've been there, you don't care what people think.
[time=2245] You just don't care because you truly, truly appreciate who your God is and what He has
[time=2254] done for you and His miraculous working power that He's done in your life.
[time=2260] When everybody else gave up on you, that's the God that we serve today.
[time=2267] He's a wonderful God.
[time=2273] Jesus was looking for a church that forgives, not condemns.
[time=2280] Listen to me today, you've got to get this.
[time=2284] We are not the judge.
[time=2287] Hello?
[time=2290] Somehow we thought we were.
[time=2292] We are not the judge.
[time=2293] Our job is to love people straight back to the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2299] That's our job.
[time=2301] And when the outside people see that, all them people, I'm going to tell you, Fort Wayne is looking for a God.
[time=2308] Look what's going on right now in Fort Wayne.
[time=2311] We don't have time to sit around in meetings all the time and talk about what color the carpet is going to be.
[time=2317] We've got a job to do and that's to go out and seek and to save that which you lost.
[time=2322] Then people are starving for something and we've got the answer.
[time=2328] We've got it.
[time=2330] We've got to take it to Him.
[time=2335] And lastly, verse 31, 32, my son, the father said, "You're always with me and everything
[time=2344] I have is yours." But we had to celebrate, celebrate and be glad because this brother of yours was dead
[time=2353] and is alive again.
[time=2356] He was lost and is found.
[time=2360] The fourth one that a lot of people don't get is the lost brother.
[time=2365] The brother's lost and don't even know it.
[time=2370] He don't know, he's lost.
[time=2371] See, he's got all that.
[time=2372] He did what he was supposed to do.
[time=2374] Let me tell you this morning, there is nothing we can do to earn our way to the father, nothing.
[time=2384] You can't earn it.
[time=2386] That's why he had to come and die for us.
[time=2390] Do you think, "Well, I'll just work a little bit more or I'll be baptized or I'll do this.
[time=2395] I'll join this church.
[time=2396] I'm a deacon.
[time=2397] I'm an elder.
[time=2398] You can get.
[time=2399] I'm a pastor.
[time=2400] It does not matter.
[time=2401] There's one way to Jesus Christ.
[time=2406] One way.
[time=2410] When I'm sick, when I'm sick, I need someone to come and get me.
[time=2418] I want you to come and get me.
[time=2421] If I call you at home and it's a meal or not, I don't want you to go in and take a shower
[time=2428] and fix your hair and put on your clothes and then come over my house.
[time=2433] I want you to get out of bed, get them clothes on.
[time=2436] I want you coming over my house looking like Auntie Mama.
[time=2439] I want you over there.
[time=2441] I need you.
[time=2442] I am sick, the brother was sick and didn't know it, didn't know it.
[time=2452] How many do we see today that are sick and don't even know it.
[time=2465] What if Billy Graham's right?
[time=2470] What if 80% of the church is lost and don't even know it.
[time=2478] What if that is true?
[time=2483] Scripture says that narrow is the gate.
[time=2486] Narrow.
[time=2487] It's not narrow because it's difficult.
[time=2490] It's narrow because people think other things will get them into heaven.
[time=2499] If man has told them that or whoever has told them that, that's why we got to know what we believe.
[time=2505] In Romans it says that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe
[time=2511] in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.
[time=2519] That's the way.
[time=2522] So this morning in closing, this morning, there's a gift for you here today.
[time=2529] There's a gift.
[time=2534] When somebody gives you a gift, do you usually go and get it?
[time=2542] The gift is no good.
[time=2543] If you just let it sit there, you go and get it.
[time=2550] So he has his gift for you today.
[time=2552] He's paid the price.
[time=2553] The gift is free because the price has already been paid one day on Calvary.
[time=2559] If it is only for you, he would have done it because he loves you so much.
[time=2565] And he knew that there had to be bloodshed for redemption of sins.
[time=2571] There had to be and he was it.
[time=2575] He knew he was the only one end.
[time=2578] And so he did it.
[time=2581] Unashamedly.
[time=2582] He did it for you.
[time=2585] He had you on his mind.
[time=2587] And so today, he's done everything else for you.
[time=2592] And it's not by accident that you're here this morning.
[time=2596] God has brought you here to have an encounter with him today.
[time=2601] Now the choice is yours.
[time=2605] Are you ready to come home?
[time=2608] Some of you have maybe never been home today is your day.
[time=2614] After this prayer, I'm going to ask you to come to say Jesus.
[time=2626] Please forgive me.
[time=2628] I know who you are who you say you are.
[time=2632] And I'm ready to accept you.
[time=2634] Where I know if I take my last breath today or if you come back today, I know where I'm going to go.
[time=2641] Some of you know Jesus Christ, but you've been out there for a long time.
[time=2646] And everybody's giving up on you.
[time=2649] Not everybody.
[time=2651] Jesus is right here this morning.
[time=2653] He has his arms open wide and he's saying, "Hey, come home.
[time=2656] I really love you.
[time=2658] Come home." Maybe you have a burden too big to take home.
[time=2663] Maybe you got a son, daughter, husband, wife that you need to lay down here from active
[time=2671] obedience.
[time=2672] Could you do in your chair?
[time=2673] Yes.
[time=2674] But he didn't die alone.
[time=2675] He didn't die worrying about who was there.
[time=2679] He did it publicly.
[time=2682] And that's what I want to ask you to do today.
[time=2684] That act of obedience.
[time=2685] But some of you need that gift, you need that gift.
[time=2688] I'm going to ask you to stay in right now, please.
[time=2692] No one looking around right now, please.
[time=2694] No one looking around.
[time=2695] I'm going to ask you.
[time=2697] How many would say to me, "Jeff, I am not 100% sure that if I take my last breath, I don't
[time=2707] know where I'm going to go.
[time=2708] I'm just not 100% sure.
[time=2710] Please.
[time=2711] And let's just emergency, please.
[time=2712] No one leave, please.
[time=2714] I'm just not for sure.
[time=2717] I don't know.
[time=2718] I'm 99, but I'm not 100.
[time=2720] I want you to be 100.
[time=2722] Say, "Jeff, please pray for me.
[time=2724] I really need to accept Christ." I want to make sure today with every head back, I'm going to ask you as I scan the audience.
[time=2734] I'm going to ask you just to look up at me and I'll pray for you.
[time=2738] Thank you.
[time=2740] Oh, man.
[time=2741] Thank you.
[time=2742] Wow.
[time=2743] Thank you.
[time=2744] Thank you for your honesty.
[time=2745] Thank you.
[time=2748] Thank you from somebody that everybody gave up on, that he was right there for me.
[time=2756] So today when you come and get that gift, right after this prayer, I'm going to open the altar up to you and the team will sing, "Father, in the name of Jesus right now, I
[time=2773] will just pray that you do what only you can do." Lord, I pray that you would give people the courage to take that first step, you'll take
[time=2784] over after that, and that they would come and just lay it here right before you today.
[time=2791] They're desperate for you, Lord.
[time=2793] We have some desperate things going on.
[time=2794] We have some God-challenged things going on, and we need you.
[time=2799] We can't do it ourselves anymore.
[time=2802] So my Lord right now, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that you would move throughout
[time=2808] this place.
[time=2809] The team is going to sing, "Right now, I'm going to go down if you need someone.
[time=2813] I'll be here if you just need to come and pray," the altar is open for you.
[time=2830] Today's your day.
[time=2832] Don't leave here.
[time=2834] Not knowing for sure.
[time=2843] If you're in the balcony, come right down or I'll meet you.
[time=2854] You're in your tomb today, give it up.
[time=2859] Today's your day.
[time=2860] Don't stay there.
[time=2868] Through the blood of Jesus Christ, what do you really need?
[time=2883] You're in the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2899] Ever host to you, the Lord of all created things.
[time=2922] Without playing, we are free in your sight, holy entering with confidence to the place
[time=2945] of the King, rich and poor and blind, falling flesh to life.
[time=2962] Through the blood of Jesus Christ, we're safe.
[time=2972] Through the blood of Jesus Christ, freely I have come to be for the highest road.
[time=2995] You're in the name of God, holy entering with confidence to life.
[time=3062] I ask so, we plough in an envelope that obeys sure us that we could ever host to you, the
[time=3080] Lord of all created things.
[time=3090] You're in the name of Jesus Christ, holy entering with confidence to life.
[time=3106] Let's go back to at the cross, at the cross, sure.
[time=3135] As others are finishing up, let's just worship a little bit more and then we'll be done.
[time=3139] Let's go back to at the cross and just worship Him this morning.
[time=3148] Is everything okay with you?
[time=3152] Come to me, you guys, others are still here, they're still telling me you.
[time=3170] You hear pictures, not victims, God has got to give for you.
[time=3183] Hey, brother, what do you come for this morning?
[time=3199] You have overcome the grave, glory fills the highest place, what can separate me?
[time=3215] You make a way, when you say that it is done, that you sort of am, you make a way, when
[time=3233] you say that it is done, Jesus, you sort of am, you make a way.
[time=3245] You say that it is done, you sort of am, you make a way, when you say that it is done,
[time=3262] said it was done, you said that it is done, Lord you said that it is done, yes, you said
[time=3281] that it is done, at the cross I found my knee, where your blood was shed for me, there's
[time=3299] no greater love than this.
[time=3306] You have overcome the grave, glory fills the highest place, what can separate me?
[time=3323] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=3350] Hey our God is good, isn't he?
[time=3364] I really felt the Lord's presence here today, and he said if you don't give up, you will
[time=3376] see a harvest, just don't give up, you all didn't give up did you?
[time=3385] Jerry can you stand right here with me, just stand right here, this is Jerry, and today
[time=3392] Jerry accepted Jesus' cross as his personal savior, so now we ain't done, this is an awesome
[time=3420] young couple, come stand with me, tell me your first name, Lydia, Jared, Lady and Jared
[time=3427] just come today and they both accepted Jesus' cross as their personal savior, that's awesome,

[time=3469] and we just pray that God will come down, I can't say enough about being here today,
