[time=59] Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast. My name is Kelly Burt, and I have the privilege of serving here at Blackhawk Ministries as the senior pastor, and I'm so thankful that you've tuned in again to the broadcast.
[time=72] As always, it is a joy to get to spend this time with you, and over the last couple of weeks I've been gone, and I wanted to just take a moment and say thank you to Steve Webster and to Pastor Jeff Carroll. If you've been watching the broadcast over these last couple of weeks, you know that while myself and our team from Blackhawk here, while we were in Nairobi, Kenya, for a 12-day trip that I can't wait
[time=98] to tell you more about, we were blessed at the same time here in the Blackhawk family to have Steve and Jeff come and to teach and communicate from God's word they did a fantastic job, and I am so grateful for those guys.
[time=112] Both Steve and Jeff have become great friends of mine personally.
[time=117] They both mean a great deal to me and have both been a huge encouragement, not only to me but to our ministry here at Blackhawk, so I hope you were encouraged, and I can't wait to have those guys back again, and we'll look forward to seeing more and more of Steve and Jeff in the days to come here on the Bible Hour. Hey I also want to just tell you we had a phenomenal time. Many of you, many of you I know because I've heard from you, have been praying for our trip to Nairobi, to the New Life Home Trust Orphanage, and to the opportunities that God had for us there in Nairobi. It was an amazing experience, and I want to just tell you that today on the broadcast you're going to hear from myself a little bit, and also from two members of our team, and over the next three weeks you're going to hear from different members of our team as they share with you and our family here at Blackhawk the experience that God gave them, the things that God taught them, and the opportunities that He provided. It was an amazing privilege for us to go. You've been hearing us for the last year and a half talk about the priesthood of all believers and how if you know the Lord Jesus Christ the scriptures say that you're a part of a royal priesthood, and as we've studied the priesthood of all believers we've realized that one thing that priests do, or one thing maybe we should say that they don't do, is they don't sit. Priests don't settle. Priests don't stay
[time=204] home. No priests are those who represent God. They pass God along to others. A royal priesthood. A godly priesthood is
[time=214] mobile, and so we go. We go across the street, we go across town, we go across this country, and in some cases we go as it says in Acts 1-8 to the outermost parts of the world and what a privilege it was to go to Nairobi. I can't wait to tell you more about it. I can't wait for you to be encouraged as you hear from those on our team this morning in the broadcast and also over the next couple of weeks. Thank you for praying. Thank you for your support and your encouragement. We're grateful to have you as part of the Blackhawk family and we can't wait to share more with you in the days to come. Hey, God bless you.
[time=250] Thanks for tuning in, and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=275] Hey everybody, it's so good to see all of you, and we want to just
[time=284] myself, Tony, and Hannah, others from our team are here today as a team,
[time=290] and what a team it was. I'll tell you, I was blessed beyond words to be able to be a part of such a special group of people who gave up a great deal and gave a great deal to this unbelievable opportunity that God gave us.
[time=306] To go to Nairobi, Kenya, to give most of our time and effort to an amazing, amazing team of people at a place called New Life Home Trust Orphanage. They have a main campus there in Nairobi, five satellite sites all over Kenya, and they have for a number of years now been giving themselves wholeheartedly to quite an amazing mission.
[time=331] New Life exists really to aid in the rescue of abandoned babies.
[time=336] There are over 300 babies that are abandoned every day in Kenya, most of them thrown out in trash heaps in plastic bags,
[time=346] some dropped into sewer ditches, others left in baskets at police stations.
[time=353] This is not really a cruel thing, although it sounds that way.
[time=357] So many of these little ones are abandoned by hurting mothers who
[time=363] live in a level of poverty that you could never
[time=369] imagine. And so many of these mothers feel hopeless and absolutely feel as if they have nowhere to go. They certainly don't want to try and raise a child at times in those circumstances and so be it a physical poverty issue or the presence of HIV which leaves them hopeless as well in their minds.
[time=389] These babies are being abandoned. New Life Home and others who work with them are doing a phenomenal job of coming to the aid of these little ones, feeding them, holding them, helping them grow up medically and spiritually and personally investing in them and it is something to see.
[time=408] And so we had an amazing 10-11 days or so where we got to know that staff. We got to be a part of that orphanage and I can't wait today. I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that but I wanted Tony and Hannah to come and share a little bit with you.
[time=423] Over the next couple of weeks I'm going to have a few others from our team just come and share as well what God did in their hearts as they were willing to what we've been talking about for a while around here. They were willing to go and to be a priest to pass along God and his attributes to others and I was like I said blessed to be a part of this team and I'm thankful for the chance you get this morning to kind of hear from Tony and Hannah.
[time=447] So Tony and Hannah share with the folks if you would.
[time=450] Thanks for being here. Well first Hannah and I would like to just say it was really an honor for us to get to go over to Nairobi and to serve in this way and we want to say thank you to all of you.
[time=464] Many of you supported the team financially and probably even many more
[time=470] of you and more importantly you supported the team through prayer and so thank you for that. Kelly asked us to come and to share a thought about what God is teaching us as a result of this experience
[time=484] and I think that the most honest answer that Hannah and I could give is we don't know. We are in the process of wrestling with
[time=494] the things that we saw and experienced and we're processing but as we thought and prayed about what to share this morning with you our family here at Blackhawk we realize that the question that we're really asking these days asking each other and asking people that God's putting around us is as a result of the things that we saw and experienced how should we live or how should we live differently
[time=519] than what we have been. You'll get to hear some of the things that we saw playing with people, babies who were abandoned by their parents
[time=531] going to Kibera the second largest slum in Africa.
[time=536] A million people in a 1.5 square mile area with no running water trash everywhere no sewage system I mean it's just the things that we saw and experienced caused us to ask that question how should we live and how should we live differently.
[time=553] Just one short story about a lesson that we learned to help us move in this
[time=559] direction of living differently and this lesson was actually taught to us by an eight or nine year old boy. New life home the place that we were at
[time=570] most of the time has a number of facilities throughout Kenya and the one we were at just has babies zero up to three once they turn three they have to go somewhere else and there's a number of places they go but one of them is called the ARC and it's in Nairobi and right now there's 10 kids from the ages of I don't know five or six to twelve out there and they're there because they haven't been adopted yet and most of them have some kind of disability or their HIV positive or both and so we went there one afternoon hand on eye and we were playing with the kids and having a great time and one of them this little eight or nine year old boy came up to me and I had some old tennis shoes on there kind of bright blue and so he noticed them and I could tell he was looking at him and he came up to me and he pointed to him and the question that he asked me
[time=625] just made my heart sink he said that just this just shows you his
[time=632] perspective on material things he said who gave you
[time=638] those shoes who gave you those shoes because to him everything
[time=646] that he had he recognized that it had been given to him and as we processed that and that's still our processing that we were realizing that he has a better perspective on things on material things than we do and that's really been challenging the clothes that we have on the the food that we'll eat today all the stuff that we have has been given to us really and so this little boy taught us his valuable lesson hopefully that will move us as we wrestle and process move us towards living the way that God wants us to live and Hannah's been God's really been putting some passages from Isaiah on her heart they kind of are related to this she's going to read that but before that I just want to ask a couple really quick questions from what I just said for us to think about
[time=694] for us to think about and maybe for you to think about and it's who gave you the shoes that you're wearing today and what does God want you to do with them Isaiah chapter 58 verse six through eight says
[time=712] is not this the fast that I choose to loose the bonds of wickedness to undo the straps of the yoke to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house when you see the naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh then shall your light break forth like the dawn and your healing shall spring up speedily your righteousness shall go before you the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard hey if you wouldn't mind maybe just uh bow your heads
[time=755] let me close your eyes and just take a moment here and and just think for a moment and then pray with me if you would we are we're a blessed people my friends
[time=770] and you know every time I go away and every time God gives me the privilege of seeing other people in other places
[time=780] every time my eyes get to take in you know scenes that we you and I wouldn't readily see in our everyday life here when I meet people who love God and are doing their very best to serve and honor him in other places every time I go through that it just it grows my heart it expands my soul and my understanding of God and his kingdom and I just pray and my hope is that as we as a family continue to learn
[time=813] and give ourselves to this this biblical idea this picture that the scriptures paint of a priesthood that doesn't sit but a priesthood that goes I know it says in Psalm 46 that were to be still and you and I both know the great value of being still at times and knowing that he is God and relating and living in intimacy with him but then there comes a time each and every day when I believe he
[time=841] calls us to be a people who are willing to extend ourselves we are to be a people that are about others and not ourselves and whether that going and that giving is across the street into the workplace across town
[time=858] across this country of ours or as it says in Acts 1 8 to the outermost parts of the world God's called you and I to go
[time=869] and so let's just as a family today can we just thank God for the the opportunity he gave us it was a unique and special one there will be many others we hope let's thank him for what he did in sending us and bringing us back but let's just also pray and beg God to keep growing us into a people a priesthood that would love and honor him and want nothing more than to go and share that love with others father God thank you for the morning thank you for the worship the privilege of worship that is ours I thank you for Tony and Hannah and others on our team and God their willingness to now come back and begin to think through the implications of what this time means and what it is God that you'd have us do the kind of people that you'd have us be in light of what we've seen and experienced oh God I pray that our family here at Black Hawk would continue to be a family very very given in their hearts young ones and older ones those that have recently come to know your son and those God that have been walking with him for years God may we be more mobile than we've ever been may there be a going spirit in us may there be vision and perspective that you would bring to our hearts and minds and souls and lives that would constantly be looking for the opportunities God to serve to care for to come alongside to pass along your attributes of love and goodness and kindness and gentleness to others we pray this in your son's name and we thank you we thank you for your son for the life and the future and the hope that he has given us and we pray these things and we hope for these things and God we commit to cooperate with you in these things in your son's precious name and all the people agreed and said amen Hannah read from Isaiah 58 that the glory of the Lord will be our
[time=994] rearguard who reminds me of second Corinthians two that says that God always leads us he always leads us in triumphal triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him the Lord okay eternal the day of march has come
[time=1025] henceforth in fields of conquest thy tend shall be our home
[time=1034] through days of reparation thy grace has made us strong
[time=1042] and now will kingdom no we live down by the song
[time=1056] oh lead our new king eternal till since fierce war shall
[time=1064] cease and holiness shall whisper the sweet

[time=1320] of that honor and privilege to be salt and light in the aroma of christ
[time=1326] to our neighbors and our family and our co-workers and around the world in Jesus name
[time=1346] who here among us has not been broken who here among us
[time=1357] is without you to pain slow off to bend and buy our transgressions
[time=1369] if such a thing is great sixes the grace was made for lives like this

[time=1386] no no no no no no no no no no no no
[time=1439] there's such a thing is great sixes and grace was made for lives like this

[time=1562] there are no more fans of God
[time=1592] a lot of amazing experience just to be able to look back at those pictures
[time=1610] I hadn't I've been kind of back into the trying to kind of get back into the swing of things it had been a few days since I had looked at any of them and so to see them again today has been incredibly encouraging there's so much so much on my own heart I think so much on our hearts as a team that we'd love to
[time=1630] share with you we'll do our very best today here a little bit and then even in the even in the days to come I'm going to have some others from our team come in and share
[time=1641] some things with us over the next couple of Sundays and so we'll be I'll be looking forward to giving you the opportunity to hear more from them I will tell you this couple things this morning number one I just want you to know and I do experience this as well
[time=1657] every time that I travel and I'm so grateful for the freedom that you allow me so thankful
[time=1663] for the opportunity that this family provides me to go at times and do my very best with God's
[time=1669] help to be a priest to pass along God to others to encourage others to be encouraged by others
[time=1676] it always happens that way and whether it's in Nairobi or whether it's in Ivanovo or whether
[time=1682] it's in Biloxi wherever it is that we go what oftentimes happens and it happened again this time
[time=1688] is you realize that within this kingdom of God within this family of God to be specific
[time=1696] you really do have and I want you to know this you have some you have some of the most amazing
[time=1703] brothers and sisters that you've that you've never met there are in this family of God my friends
[time=1711] that you and I have the privilege to be a part of there are some of the most gracious some of the
[time=1717] most generous some of the most giving people you have ever ever met people who who have so much
[time=1726] less than you and I you know one of the amazing realizations and I may even told you this after our trip there last June was Tony mentioned kibera 1.5 square miles 1.2 million people
[time=1737] you you you could read my blog 10 times a day I could tell you 30 minutes more of it this morning
[time=1745] and no matter what I wrote or no matter what I said you could never ever imagine what it's like
[time=1752] you've never seen anything you've never dreamt anything you've never imagined anything like
[time=1760] and one of the things that we realized as a team is that in our week at the orphanage as we would
[time=1766] come alongside this the staff gals that are there every day you know morning noon and night this
[time=1773] staff of ladies who come faithfully every day and they serve and they they feed and they change diapers and they they helped us do the same they they clean the place they play with the kids they
[time=1785] oversee the meals they oversee their their nutrition they oversee their medication is the most amazing
[time=1792] team of gals that you've ever been around they worked so hard and not only do they work hard but they work and they give themselves to these little ones with such joy they they we learn we could
[time=1803] sing a few songs for you right now they sing songs you know when they eat they sing songs when it's time to clean up they sing songs when they pray they sing songs at bedtime all the songs and
[time=1814] stilling in their hearts and minds wonderful biblical god-honoring truth these ladies are amazing and
[time=1822] they're professional and they're efficient and they don't miss a thing and then about halfway through the week you realize about halfway through the week you through conversation you come to the
[time=1835] realization that these ladies live in kibera but that's their home and that every day they crawl
[time=1845] out of a hut and they put on their dress and they walk to new life home and they give themselves
[time=1854] away in in a fashion that would just blow you away and they would have you would have I would
[time=1862] have never guessed it unless I had been told you would have never guessed that their life
[time=1869] was completely void of absolutely anything anything nice you would have never guessed that
[time=1882] they've lived every day of their lives in that same hut going to the bathroom in a hole
[time=1890] and having nothing but when you're around them and when you fellowship with them
[time=1898] and when you work side by side with them you're encouraged you're blessed you're built up
[time=1904] it's an incredible experience I can't begin to tell you how thankful I am for the opportunities
[time=1912] that I think and I hope that I pray many of you will have in the days to come they want us to come
[time=1918] back and you know what new life home in Nairobi it's not the only opportunity that God's giving us these days it's one and I can't wait wherever it is that we're able to send you wherever it is that
[time=1930] you end up going whatever it is you end up doing my hope as I wrote in my blog while I was gone was
[time=1936] that you would have the privilege of going somewhere where you can see how big God really is how broad
[time=1943] the kingdom really is the opportunities that exist for you and I to encourage and come alongside and be encouraged in the process and I can't wait for your experience it's very good to be home I
[time=1954] can't tell you how nice it is to see you I'm so thankful for Steve Webster so thankful for Jeff
[time=1960] Carroll heard we had an altar call while I was gone well look at that I thought there'd be an amen
[time=1967] thank you Neil I thought there'd be an amen that's awesome I actually got to listen to the message late last week and was really encouraged and both Steve and Jeff have become very close friends
[time=1978] both Steve and Jeff you know what you'll see you'll see more of Steve and probably Jeff in the days
[time=1984] to come and I'm grateful that they were willing to come so thankful that they did what they did it's good to be back it's good to be my goodness it's good to be it's good to see my family my family
[time=1994] boy coming back was just a yeah it was one of those tests that God gives us we were all
[time=2000] we were all very very very very ready to come home grateful for the trip but really thankful for
[time=2008] the chance to come home we got on the plane around 11 o'clock at night I think it was on a Sunday
[time=2016] night in Nairobi and we sat on the runway in Nairobi for I think almost two hours and so the two
[time=2024] hour delay in Nairobi completely messed up the flight we got to Amsterdam had missed our flight
[time=2030] to Detroit this was a 747 from Nairobi to Amsterdam so there were about 300 not really happy people
[time=2038] and we all got sent to one line and the KLM folks did their best to accommodate but boy there
[time=2046] was a lot of confusion and just a lot of frustration anyway I ended up on a later flight to Detroit
[time=2052] that I think Tony and Hannah ended up getting flown to Toronto I think the rest got flown to
[time=2058] Chicago we all got split up and I ended up flying into Detroit with a five and a half hour layover
[time=2066] before I caught a little you know puddle jumper to Fort Wayne well I wasn't looking forward to it
[time=2072] at all and I landed in Detroit you know whipped out the cell phone called my wife to tell her that I
[time=2079] was there and you know wondered if she wanted to talk for five and a half hours and she says you
[time=2089] know she says you know what we we just watched you land and she had gotten all the kids out of school
[time=2095] and they had gone up to Detroit and I didn't have to wait five and a half hours I got to get my stuff
[time=2101] see my kids see my wife go to where did we go Burger King when the Burger King I had a couple
[time=2109] whoppers and life was good so it is good to be home good to be to see our house good to be in my
[time=2117] bed we you know if we can just be honest and Frank it's nice to be back in my bathroom if you if you travel at all into remote place I'm just learning I'm a novice but I'm just learning
[time=2129] as you travel you're gonna just have to be flexible on the whole restroom thing but it's good to be good to be back but as Tony and Hannah challenged us I think I'm just gonna have to be back now
[time=2140] there's just no getting around it I think I'm just gonna have to be I think I am I think he's
[time=2146] he's changed me in some ways and while I'm thankful to be back I just think I'm gonna be back
[time=2153] different it's just it's just different and he just does something in you when you see it and when
[time=2161] you experience it and when you get the privilege of meeting them and when you live life with them and when you see him at work and when you go through all that something down deep inside of
[time=2172] you changes and so while I am thankful to be back and while I've never felt more called to be where
[time=2178] I am there's just something that he's doing in me and in us I think as a family that I'm so looking
[time=2184] forward to experiencing with you so thanks for your prayers and thanks for your support all right well hey if you brought your Bibles I hope you did we've got some time left why don't
[time=2198] you open up to Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 2 and as I mentioned just briefly a little while ago
[time=2205] over the last several weeks we've entitled our study on Sunday mornings after Easter and we've
[time=2212] entitled it after Easter with the idea being that following Easter as you read through the pages
[time=2219] here in the beginning of Acts the end of the Gospels in the beginning of the book of Acts as
[time=2226] you read through there you begin to realize that some things transpired there were some things that took place there were some events that occurred there were some patterns that started there were
[time=2237] some things that took place that really that very first band of Christ followers some things
[time=2243] they gave themselves to that you and I as Christ followers today can really learn from and I hope that you're about that I hope you're about learning I hope nobody in here has stopped I hope you like
[time=2255] me will continue to give yourself to what there is for us to learn as we study God's word and
[time=2262] especially as we look at how this this this first church gave themselves to what God called them to
[time=2268] do as God and we've kind of talked about this we've talked about how God in these early chapters of Acts he births his new redemptive plan he calls it the church it used to be the nation of Israel
[time=2280] now it's the church his new redemptive plan as he begins to envision his people for their ministry future after Easter as God begins to unfold God's mission what's mission mission is the reason
[time=2292] you hear mission used a lot you hear about mission this mission that you hear about mission statements
[time=2298] mission is our reason for existence why do we exist why do we get up in the morning what is it that
[time=2305] stirs us deeply and God begins to unfold for these first Christ followers these these first
[time=2312] faithful church members his mission for them and there are some questions I think that you and I
[time=2321] should ask there are some questions that should be on our mind as we watch God unfold this first
[time=2327] mission for the church as we watch God unfold his plan for the local ecclesia there are some
[time=2334] questions I think you and I can ask and I think there are some answers to be to be found that will really give you and I a sense of clarity and a sense of purpose and a sense of direction as we give ourselves to that very same endeavor the endeavor of the church how did they respond
[time=2350] as we see God unfold this how did they respond what values think about it what values are embraced
[time=2358] by this very first church what priorities were established what kind of heart do we see what few
[time=2364] things listen to this what few things were they focused and intentional about when it came to the
[time=2372] one thing God had left them there to do I've got to be honest with you the more and more I'm at
[time=2378] this with you all the more and more I give myself to this thing called leadership in the church
[time=2385] the more and more this interests me I have to be honest with you again and tell you there was a time in my life really not too long ago where I felt as if maybe more was best there was a time
[time=2400] in my life where if you were to ask me about ministry when you if you were to ask me about how it is I think the church should function when if you were to ask me about how it is I'd want to come at helping people grow in their faith there was a day I think when I really would have told you
[time=2416] that the bigger the buffet the better the more options the better more classes more groups more
[time=2426] topics more videos more more more more more more more I would have thought that somewhere in all that
[time=2433] more maybe there would have been somehow the opportunity to connect with everybody and move
[time=2441] everybody in the direction that they should at this unique time and they're like I think that's how I would have answered that question for a long long time but I'll tell you what the more I read
[time=2453] the gospels the more I read the book of Acts the more I read the epistles the more I open my heart
[time=2461] to what seems to be God's design for the church the buffet just keeps getting smaller and smaller
[time=2471] and smaller and when you look at what was transpiring here in these early days I want to read that
[time=2477] question to you again what few what few things were they focused and intentional about when it
[time=2488] came to the one thing God left them here to do many of you in the room know what the one thing
[time=2495] is many of you have studied this enough many of you have heard enough sermons some of you in the
[time=2502] room have have really given yourself to your very best effort with God's help to live these
[time=2508] truths out and you know what that one thing is that he said he left you and I here to do others
[time=2515] if you maybe don't and I want to just remind you that he was very clear about it in Matthew 28 Matthew 28 as it's time for our Lord to ascend to go and be with the Father he's leaving the
[time=2526] redemptive opportunity called the church now in the hands of the apostles and with his last parting
[time=2532] shot he says go into all the world and make what if you know it say it out loud disciples
[time=2541] he has left you this is where oftentimes you all start glassing over and you just kind of gave
[time=2547] back at me no he has left you here you have been called you have been called to be a disciple
[time=2562] not an attender not a not a sporadic participant no he's called you to be a disciple a radical
[time=2573] and deeply devoted follower of Christ and he has called you and me together collectively
[time=2581] and given it as the mission of the church to make disciples it's the one thing
[time=2590] that he's left us here to do to bring glory and honor to him glorifying God is always our highest
[time=2597] calling and we do that by responding by being willing to be a people obedient to give ourselves
[time=2603] to that one thing and shame on us shame on me I think at times for maybe getting that a little
[time=2613] bit distracted shame on me or shame on us for I think at times making the buffet a little bit too big
[time=2620] what were as you look at the beginning chapters of Acts what were the few things that they focused
[time=2629] and were intentional about when it came to the one thing making disciples that God had left them
[time=2638] here to do I can't wait to show you it has been an incredible study all over again for me and
[time=2646] like I told you before it's never been clearer in my own heart and I'm more determined I want to say that I want to say to you this morning I'm more determined than ever and the reason I want to say that to you is this is that I'm asking you for accountability it's one thing for me to stand
[time=2662] here and say that we will in the days to come stop at nothing and be absolutely clear and focused and
[time=2668] intentional about inviting you all to help us do that one thing to be a family of priests a family
[time=2675] of disciples who are given to making disciples and honoring God in the process it's one thing for me to stand here and say that I'm asking you to hold me accountable to that and the word of God
[time=2688] here in these early chapters of Acts gives us such clear direction on how that occurred how that
[time=2695] transpired how these people gave themselves to that kind of a mission and I just can't wait for
[time=2701] you to see it and I want you to hold me and others on our team accountable to that a priest one who
[time=2709] represents God one who passes along God to others as a priest as a follower of Christ as a disciple
[time=2719] it is our calling to go beyond attendance and superficial periodic involvement my friends our
[time=2726] calling is a costly I want you to hear this it is a costly deep calling that involves the offering
[time=2733] of our entire lives to this one great cause and I want to show you how these folks as they honored
[time=2740] God and were obedient I want to show you how they came at this I think there's some principles here that I want you to see in chapter two they got the Holy Spirit in an upper room on the on the day of Pentecost we studied that in Acts chapter two God sends them the helper there
[time=2756] were 120 of them originally remember this is like three or four weeks ago and God brings them the
[time=2762] helper that he had promised to give them he brings them the Holy Spirit they are both baptized and in dwelt there in that upper room they spill over down the stairs into the streets Jerusalem is
[time=2773] packed with those from other nations and other tribes and other tongues remember and they come
[time=2779] and they wonder what's going on and there we saw God's heart we talked about it a few weeks ago we see God's initial heart for going we see God's heart for the nations he gives the apostles and
[time=2789] them the 120 the ability to speak in tongues to speak other languages so the gospel could be
[time=2795] communicated to those who wouldn't have unless he had done that who would have had no way of
[time=2801] understanding so the truth gets communicated the gospel gets proclaimed in other languages and immediately the church begins to move immediately we see God's heart for going Peter then we didn't
[time=2813] we didn't look at this in depthly I invited you to read through this but Peter then in that setting
[time=2819] gives his first ever sermon the first sermon of the new church is delivered and I want to show you
[time=2826] what happens at the conclusion of that sermon any preacher any pastor any speaker would love to
[time=2832] have this be the result of their first their first sermon no look at verse 37 now when they heard
[time=2838] this when Peter was done proclaiming he does this masterful job of proclaiming the entire gospel the
[time=2844] story of salvation and redemptive truth and in 37 it says now when they heard this they were
[time=2850] pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles brethren what shall we do
[time=2856] the multitudes respond what shall we do Peter said to them repent and each of you be baptized in the
[time=2864] name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
[time=2870] I love verse 39 for the promise he goes on to say for the promises for you and the promise the
[time=2876] promise of forgiveness the promise of hope the promise of eternal life is for your children and for all who are far off again right there in Peter's words we see that in God's design
[time=2888] this was never going to be just about Jerusalem it was never going to be just about them it was
[time=2894] never going to be a selfish thing it was always going to be an other thing promises for you and
[time=2900] your children and for all who are far off as many look at this as many as the Lord our God will call
[time=2907] to himself who is the author of salvation say it God you don't save yourself I didn't save myself
[time=2919] yes God gives us yes God calls us to respond and yes he calls us to bow the knee of our heart
[time=2926] and we do in submission to him yes when the spirit and the word of God come and bring conviction to us
[time=2932] yes it elicits from us a response but please don't ever be confused on how that all began
[time=2938] always be reminded and know that God is the author of salvation it is God who pursued you
[time=2946] it is the spirit of God that drew you to himself Peter reiterates that right here and with many
[time=2952] other words look verse 40 and with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting
[time=2959] them saying be saved it's good to remember my friends that that's what this is about
[time=2969] this heart of God to see people rescued from their sin to save them what's it say there from this
[time=2979] perverse generation be saved Peter begs them from this perverse generation look at verse 41 so then
[time=2989] so then those who had received his word were baptized and that day there were added about 3,000
[time=2996] souls 3,000 souls in one day the church goes from 120 to 3,120
[time=3004] and I think here is where you and I really need to pay attention I think right here now
[time=3010] as we go to 42 that's 41 as we move to acts 242 I would just beg you in the weeks to come
[time=3018] to come with your to come with your heart open to come with your mind open to come with a readiness
[time=3025] in your spirit to see what the word of God in the spirit of God has for you and me as we look at how
[time=3032] this church from the very beginning responded to the call of God to the call of God there were some
[time=3038] things that they gave themselves to there were some disciplines that they practiced there was a
[time=3044] heart that they had there were some priorities that they set that I think you and I should set
[time=3051] I think there's some values here that they embrace that you and I have got to continue to or begin
[time=3057] to in some ways embrace we have for us friends right here in this passage and as the book of acts
[time=3064] continues such a sweet opportunity to look at this calling that God has placed on you and me
[time=3072] as we give ourselves to the church and just ask oh God are we coming at this the right way
[time=3078] oh God are we coming at this in a way that brings honor to you God are we coming at this in a way
[time=3084] that is consistent with your design forget what others have said forget what the experts might
[time=3091] tell us God are we giving ourselves to this great endeavor called the church in a way that honors
[time=3097] you look what they did I want to show you one thing here this morning before we take off that I think it's just staggering I think it's encouraging I think it's convicting and right out of the gate
[time=3108] God gives it to us right here in 242 it says in it says in verse 42 it says they were continually
[time=3117] okay 3000 get saved now the church is 3120 instead of just 120 and so here we go 42 they were now
[time=3125] continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship to the breaking of bread
[time=3134] and to prayer everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonders and signs were taking place
[time=3141] through the apostles and all those who had believed were together and had all things in common and
[time=3148] they began selling their property and possessions and we're sharing them with all as anyone might
[time=3154] have need day by day they were continually get the picture continually day by day continuing with
[time=3163] one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house they were taking their meals together
[time=3169] with gladness and sincerity of heart they were a people who were praising God verse 47 and having
[time=3177] favor with all the people interesting there where it says that they were a church this faithful band
[time=3184] of Christ followers this very first church it says as they were doing all that continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching continually devoting themselves to each other
[time=3195] breaking bread together fellowshiping praying selling possessions giving to those who might have need it says that they found favor with all the people the all the people there isn't the already
[time=3207] convinced it doesn't mean there that they found favor with all the ones in the family no it means
[time=3213] they found favor what's that mean favor it means they were highly regarded it means they were
[time=3220] observed and what people in the culture there as they watched this first church function the people
[time=3226] in the surrounding culture fought highly of them they had a great reputation folks in the culture
[time=3235] couldn't believe what they saw they were moved by it they were stirred by it the church the body of
[time=3243] Christ in that day in these early days found favor it says with all the people and the Lord
[time=3251] what was the result of that the Lord was adding to their number what's it say say it out loud day
[time=3259] by day those who were being saved all right here's the first thing i want to show you real quick they devoted themselves if you have a pen right underline devoted just circle devoted or
[time=3270] underline devoted or if you don't like writing in your bible right devoted on your on your notepage they devoted themselves my friends this is the first thing i want you to see about these people the word devoted i looked it up this week wow it means this i had to put it on the screen for you
[time=3286] devoted means to persist obstinately in a practice to always constantly do something to be thoroughly
[time=3298] consistent and unwavering in a specific discipline or activity people church do you see that they were
[time=3311] consistent they were obstinately devoted they were obstinately consistent they were unwavering
[time=3321] unbending not going to compromise it not going to give it up not going to alter
[time=3329] any bet at all nothing we will not bend we will not move we will not be distracted from we will be
[time=3339] obstinately committed to some things that we as the church have got to be
[time=3345] committed to they were devoted to what they were devoted to three things and i can't wait to show
[time=3357] it to you what was the church obstinate about what was the church deeply devoted to
[time=3368] from the first thing i just can't wait to show you is that they were a people who were absolutely obstinately committed to gathering they gathered they were a people who stopped at nothing to be
[time=3382] together three gathering principles i want to show you next week they gathered to receive
[time=3390] teaching you can write these down they gathered to receive teaching very important for them
[time=3397] that on a continual basis it says day by day they gathered to receive teaching
