[time=514] (Applause)
[time=520] Well, hi, everybody.
[time=521] Welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=523] Anyways, it is a thrill for us to have you with us.
[time=526] We're so thankful for the relationship that God has given us.
[time=529] And if you've been watching the Bible Hour for any length of time, I think especially over the last couple of years, you know how important it is to us.
[time=539] As we've studied God's Word, we've learned more and more about what it means to be the priesthood of all believers.
[time=546] It's an amazing concept, whereas believers, literally God's Word says that we're priests who do what priests do.
[time=553] They pass along God to others.
[time=556] And I'm so thankful, most of you know this.
[time=559] Whenever I hear about somebody, whenever I meet someone who's actively fulfilling their priestly function, and you've heard me say we can pass along God to those across the street.
[time=570] We can pass along God to those in the workplace.
[time=573] We can be priests here in America.
[time=576] Or as we just experienced, you know, you can pass along God over in Nairobi, Kenya.
[time=581] We get to be priests anywhere.
[time=584] And in recent days, I've come across a family here at Black Hawk and have had the opportunity to become friends with a guy who's being a priest in a really, really exciting setting, and that is at the racetrack.
[time=597] That's right.
[time=598] In the NASCAR world, in the racing world, David Martin, and on-track ministries, they're doing their very best job with God's help to pass along God and His truth to those who have a passion for and for those who are literally involved in racing.
[time=617] And I know many of you out there are huge race fans.
[time=620] We were just talking in the studio here this morning about the race last night, and I know there's a lot of interest, and I'm so thankful, David, for you and thankful for the ministry that you have.
[time=631] Why don't you share with the folks kind of the bigger picture, the big story behind on-track ministries, and tell them about what you do and your passion for it and encourage them in the process.
[time=642] I would be happy to. Thanks for the opportunity.
[time=645] On-track ministries launched back in 1997, I was pastoring over in Columbia City, and our son, Jonathan, started racing go-karts at a bare-filled speedway.
[time=656] And every weekend, we would go out there, and we would just see hundreds of young families, and we thought there has to be some way to reach these young families, to get them involved in church, and that was the beginning of on-track ministries.
[time=670] And from that, we began to be the chaplain for the go-karts, for the stock cars at bare-filled.
[time=676] Eventually, motocross came along.
[time=678] We became a part of the Motor Racing Outreach Association, which is NASCAR's chaplain program.
[time=684] I'm not the NASCAR chaplain, that would be Tim Griffin.
[time=688] But we're a part of what happens there, and therefore, occasionally, we get to work at the tracks.
[time=694] We get to do fan outreach, and in particular, God has opened the door for us at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
[time=701] In fact, I was just down there yesterday to do the fan outreach, and so, coming up just in a few weeks during the running of the 500, we're going to have chapel service outside, parking lot 1A, Coca-Cola parking lot, parking lot 2, for the fans of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
[time=721] And something happened just this weekend.
[time=723] I got a call from one of the IRL owners, Kingdom Racing out of Houston, Texas, Kingdom Racing.net.
[time=730] If you look it on the internet, they are a Christian team.
[time=733] Davey Hamilton is going to be driving for them.
[time=736] Everybody on their board of directors are Christian businessmen.
[time=739] They want to do things right, but they called us to see what can they do to be a part of ministry at the track.
[time=745] Wow.
[time=746] And so, you may be familiar with Dr. Pat Morley from Man in the Mirror Ministries, and Dr. Pat Morley is going to be speaking at our chapel on the Coca-Cola parking lot.
[time=755] Oh, that's cool. That's cool.
[time=757] How long have you had access to the Brickyard and the Indianapolis 500?
[time=761] How long has that ministry down there at the track been going on?
[time=766] This will be our third year of ministry, but actually it's our sixth year of trying to get things launched.
[time=773] It took three years just to get the okay.
[time=776] Wow.
[time=777] And then they gave us one race.
[time=779] After they gave us one race, they came back the next year and said we would like you to do all three events, but not only all three events.
[time=786] We would like you to have two ministry locations, and they've been great to work with.
[time=790] Wow.
[time=791] So, somebody watching this morning who's got a passion for racing and a passion for the Kingdom.
[time=797] They could contact you, and we're going to put David's information here on the screen for you.
[time=802] They could contact you, and if it's here locally out at the racetrack here in town, if it's down at the Indy 500 racetrack, if there's any interest at all in helping in any of those settings,
[time=814] or just to learn more about you and what OnTrack is doing, they can contact you no problem.
[time=819] Absolutely.
[time=820] We have a website on trackministries.org.
[time=823] Great.
[time=824] That's a great place to find us.
[time=826] And one of my passions is this.
[time=828] I deal mostly with local track.
[time=830] And so, there are 12 to 1,300 local tracks, 2,200 motor cross tracks.
[time=836] Our goal is to connect those tracks and local churches.
[time=840] That somebody is ministering there, connecting the world, giving them the gospel and connecting them to a local church.
[time=849] And so, we trained chaplains.
[time=851] I did that yesterday.
[time=853] And we would love to have more people with us at Barefield.
[time=856] If you love motor cross, the carting on Friday night, the cars on Saturday, man, that would be wonderful.
[time=862] Awesome.
[time=863] And one other way you can get involved, maybe you don't like racing.
[time=866] But one of the things that we do at Indy is we give away bottled water.
[time=870] That's one of our tools.
[time=872] If we can give away bottled water to introduce them to the living water, man, it's a great opportunity.
[time=877] Awesome.
[time=878] And so, one of the ways you can get involved is by donating, it has to be Dasani water, just because we're on the Coca-Cola parking lot.
[time=885] But that's one way people can get involved.
[time=887] Anybody connected to Dasani water?
[time=889] Yeah, absolutely.
[time=890] Make sure you contact David.
[time=892] Well, I'm not a huge racing fan.
[time=895] I'm kind of a closet NASCAR guy.
[time=897] And besides the 24 car, my favorite guy is Jonathan Martin, David's son.
[time=902] He's racing hard and earning his stripes.
[time=905] And I think we're going to hear more from him someday.
[time=907] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=909] And thanks for listening.
[time=910] This means a lot to us.
[time=912] And we hope if it's something that means a lot to you, you'll contact David.
[time=916] And we're thankful, thankful for he and his family.
[time=918] Priests that have been willing to go to the track and in the process further the kingdom of God.
[time=924] Hey, God bless you.
[time=925] Thanks for tuning in.
[time=926] We'll talk to you soon.
[time=927] Bye-bye.
[time=928] This morning, Steve Webster, who joined us a few months ago back in January will be sharing with us from the book of Luke.
[time=935] He's a teacher at Black Hawk Christian High School and he teaches a number of Bible classes and some other things too.
[time=941] But I never really learned what those were.
[time=943] So as far as I'm concerned, he teaches Bible class.
[time=945] And he's teaching Luke right now.
[time=947] So not only is he sharing from the book of Luke to us this morning, but he's been studying it and preparing for it for his classes.
[time=954] And so I think we're just in for a real treat.
[time=956] Would you welcome him as he comes?
[time=958] I don't think that saying it's a hard act to follow really covers it, Corbin.
[time=972] But that's pretty awesome.
[time=974] So they are coming back.
[time=976] So we'll do a little half hour interlude here and we'll come back and sing again.
[time=980] Is that okay?
[time=981] And we'll talk about Jesus for half an hour and then we'll sing about Jesus at the end.
[time=986] So let's say it seems appropriate to me.
[time=988] Good morning everybody.
[time=990] There is a long break between Easter and Christmas for us.
[time=996] There's spring.
[time=998] We love spring.
[time=999] It's actually spring-ish outside.
[time=1001] Right now we like that.
[time=1003] I enjoy that.
[time=1004] Do you like that too?
[time=1005] Good.
[time=1006] But what to do in summer and fall?
[time=1009] What do we do then?
[time=1011] When's your time we have Christmas, we make much of Christmas, we ought to make much of Christmas, the great gift of our Savior.
[time=1019] But I got thinking last year what to do in between in my summer months and my fall months.
[time=1025] What do we do?
[time=1027] I submit to you that in Luke 24 this morning we have some really good suggestions from Jesus
[time=1033] as to what we ought to be about, what we ought to be doing.
[time=1038] Luke 24, if you go there with me please, we'll start in verse 36 in just a moment.
[time=1042] Luke 24 starting in verse 36.
[time=1046] What we ought to do in the summer and fall have never been more important than they are now.
[time=1050] We are living in troubling times, my friends.
[time=1054] Troubling times not only in Kenya.
[time=1056] The last time I was here we talked about how in Kenya there was a murderous rampage going on.
[time=1062] And we are right to pray for the safety of our dear friends who are there.
[time=1065] We'll do that later on.
[time=1067] But that murderous rampage has come to our own city.
[time=1071] When I was in Florida with my family on spring break there were eight homicides in the week that we were gone.
[time=1078] Those of you who are here you remember that all too well.
[time=1081] Homicide, suicide this past week at our high schools, violence at IPFW in the recent days,
[time=1088] earthquakes, and Indiana.
[time=1091] And earth really more like an earth shimmy than an earthquake.
[time=1096] We kind of trembled for a moment and that was our version of an earthquake.
[time=1099] But these are uncertain times.
[time=1102] What do we do?
[time=1104] Easter was great.
[time=1106] We're on that high.
[time=1107] I'm on the high from that music.
[time=1109] That's pretty great.
[time=1112] But what to do all summer?
[time=1114] I'm a teacher as Corbin mentioned.
[time=1116] I get anxious about July 4th.
[time=1119] I just really don't know what to do with myself.
[time=1122] I'm glad to offer some suggestions.
[time=1125] And maybe I'll take my own advice today as to what we might do in the summer and fall months together.
[time=1132] God called us and is calling us to share Christ with the world, with Fort Wayne and the world,
[time=1140] in our cul-de-sacs, in our neighborhoods.
[time=1143] We called them subdivisions in Florida.
[time=1145] They called them additions here.
[time=1146] I'm still getting my mind around that.
[time=1148] That's okay.
[time=1149] In your addition, we share Jesus.
[time=1152] We share Him in the world, in Kenya, wherever our feet take us to go.
[time=1157] I want to read the passage with you from Luke 24, verses 30, 60, 49.
[time=1162] And then pray with you about our time together.
[time=1165] I'm excited.
[time=1166] I'm excited to share with you that Jesus really is risen from the dead.
[time=1173] You really did rise from the dead.
[time=1174] That's not something we just talk about.
[time=1176] It's not a metaphor.
[time=1179] It's true.
[time=1180] He was dead, and now he is alive.
[time=1183] Isn't that wonderful?
[time=1185] Luke 24, 36.
[time=1191] As they were talking about these things, Jesus Himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace to you." But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw Spirit.
[time=1200] He said to them, "Why are you troubled?
[time=1203] Why do doubts arise in your hearts?
[time=1205] See my hands in my feet that it is I, myself.
[time=1210] Touch me and see.
[time=1212] For Spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have." And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
[time=1221] And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them,
[time=1227] "Have you anything here to eat?" He gave him a piece of broiled fish and he took it and ate before them.
[time=1234] Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."
[time=1246] Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures and said to them,
[time=1252] "Thus it is written that the Christ should suffer on the third day, rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations,
[time=1263] beginning from Jerusalem." You are witnesses of these things.
[time=1268] And behold, I'm sending the promise of my Father upon you, but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.
[time=1277] Please pray with me this morning as we begin.
[time=1283] God, we are overwhelmed.
[time=1284] We are overwhelmed at your greatness.
[time=1287] And I echo those words, Father, not unto us, but to your name be the glory.
[time=1295] We echo John the Apostle in Revelation when the angels sing,
[time=1301] "Worthy is the lamb to receive glory and honor and power and dominion forever and ever."
[time=1308] They will never stop singing that, Father, night and day.
[time=1313] And we are called by your Son Jesus in this passage to go into all the world
[time=1321] and proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in his name, Lord, to all the nations, to Kenyans, to Hoosiers, and everyone in between.
[time=1332] We thank you for your love.
[time=1334] We thank you for your greatness.
[time=1336] We thank you that we have a chance this morning to hear from you in your word.
[time=1339] God, would you please go before us, go before our conversation, be honored in it.
[time=1344] We pray in Jesus' name.
[time=1347] [AMEN] There will be some notes on the screen behind me.
[time=1352] So if you would like to follow along in that way, you're certainly welcome to do so.
[time=1356] This passage is a fairly simple passage, but it's extraordinary in its simplicity.
[time=1364] The first thing we see in these verses in verse 36 is that Jesus is risen from the dead.
[time=1371] Again, not a metaphor, not a get you through the day, you're feeling down, you're feeling troubled.
[time=1377] It's okay because he rose from the dead as some kind of a, almost like a figure of speech.
[time=1384] The text, every word, friends, of these first eight verses, almost every word makes it plain,
[time=1391] but he was physically dead.
[time=1393] Every early creed always included that he was crucified, he was buried.
[time=1398] And that he was risen from the dead.
[time=1401] Why buried?
[time=1403] Buried insists that he was really actually dead.
[time=1408] And beyond that he was really actually dead, now he really actually is alive.
[time=1413] The wonder of his resurrection sings out to us in those early creeds.
[time=1417] Those followers of the followers of Jesus made it very plain to us.
[time=1422] He really is risen from the dead.
[time=1425] Luke, in his gospel here, watch this with me.
[time=1428] He insists on the bodily resurrection of Jesus that he has a body, and that body was dead,
[time=1435] it was killed, it was murdered, and that body was raised to life by God the Father.
[time=1441] In verse 36 it says, "As they were talking about these things," and so that begs the question.
[time=1447] What things?
[time=1449] Well, before that in verses 3, 2, 3, 5, the road to Emmaus conversation has taken place.
[time=1453] I won't go back there with you this morning, but those verses describe that there's two people on the road to Emmaus, and they see Jesus among them.
[time=1460] He opens their minds, understanding the scriptures, there's that verse again.
[time=1464] Didn't our hearts burn within us, they say?
[time=1467] They go find the 11 in Jerusalem, they described him all things that Jesus did and said among them, and then they're in this room, in verse 40, in verse 36 they're in a room, and then all of a sudden Jesus, in verse 36, stood among them.
[time=1480] Jesus himself, the Mayest Road experience, I would love to have been there like a fly on the shoulder of one of those guys.
[time=1487] Here in Jesus talk about all the things in the Bible, guys are about me, he says.
[time=1493] It's all, can you imagine those stories?
[time=1495] All the way from the law of Moses through the prophets to the Psalms.
[time=1499] All about Jesus, and he explains it to them.
[time=1503] It is no great, is no small encouragement to me that Jesus describes himself as a teacher.
[time=1509] I like that, a good, a good bit.
[time=1511] He is a teacher.
[time=1512] It says in verse 34, if we go through with me in Luke 24, Luke 24, 34,
[time=1518] appearing to these disciples, they say the Lord has risen indeed.
[time=1523] And so on Easter morning when we say, let's try it again.
[time=1526] I look forward all your sayness, and I'm going to say it again because I can.
[time=1529] Okay, here we go.
[time=1530] He is risen.
[time=1531] He has risen indeed.
[time=1533] I love that.
[time=1534] That's where it gets the place from which it comes.
[time=1536] Is that verse?
[time=1537] He has indeed risen.
[time=1539] The word indeed there means actually so.
[time=1542] Really?
[time=1544] Certainly.
[time=1545] In truth, he rose from the dead.
[time=1548] He appeared to be alive, and we were sad.
[time=1551] And then we thought he was alive, and then we felt better.
[time=1554] Hardly.
[time=1555] That's not even possible.
[time=1556] It says in that verse in verse 36 again, that he himself stood among them.
[time=1562] It's emphatic.
[time=1563] It's like they were saying, yeah, the very Jesus they were talking about, he was there.
[time=1567] He was in their midst.
[time=1569] He was among them in verse 36.
[time=1572] He Jesus himself stood among them and said, "Peace to you."
[time=1578] They didn't have peace.
[time=1579] These are guys who are very upset.
[time=1582] Look at the next verse, if you would, please.
[time=1584] Verse 37 with me.
[time=1587] They needed peace.
[time=1589] They were startled and frightened.
[time=1591] They thought they saw a spirit.
[time=1593] In Mark chapter 6, Jesus appears to disciples walking on the sea, and they freak out.
[time=1599] They think it's a ghost.
[time=1601] And he says, "It's okay.
[time=1602] It's me.
[time=1603] Don't be afraid." The same thing is going on here.
[time=1606] They didn't understand.
[time=1607] These are very, very strong words.
[time=1610] The words for troubled here in verse 38 causing inward turmoil, stirring up, being disturbed
[time=1619] or throwing you into a confusion.
[time=1624] I'm persuaded.
[time=1624] Luke is talking, he was not one of the twelve disciples.
[time=1629] And in writing his gospel, he does a careful investigation to talk to all the people who were there who actually heard and saw Jesus and when they were among him, they were among
[time=1639] his midst, if you will.
[time=1640] He asked them questions.
[time=1641] He carefully investigates all these things concerning, Jesus, and he writes it down in his gospel.
[time=1645] Now, why would Luke paint these disciples as these scaredy cats?
[time=1650] Why would he do that?
[time=1651] If he wants to be persuasive, if he wants to be convincing, say, "Hey, these guys were at it, man," these two verses to me, they just scream out, "This is a reliable account
[time=1663] of what actually did happen for that reason." But if you're trying to be persuasive, if you're trying to cook it up, these disciples are really, really strong guys.
[time=1673] In Jesus' name, they went out there and changed the world.
[time=1676] They did, of course, later.
[time=1677] But right now, they're scared and they're troubled and they're frightened and they're cowering, inferior in this room in Jerusalem.
[time=1685] So that just speaks to me about the authenticity of this particular passage.
[time=1690] Wouldn't you make him seem more convincing or more strong or something?
[time=1693] I don't know.
[time=1695] The word there for "doubts," in verse 38, is inter-dialogue.
[time=1700] Like, is he really alive?
[time=1702] I don't know.
[time=1703] Is he alive?
[time=1704] Maybe he is.
[time=1705] Is he not?
[time=1706] I don't know.
[time=1707] Is he really alive?
[time=1708] I don't know.
[time=1709] Dogg with yourself.
[time=1710] The word is broken down.
[time=1711] It means talking with yourself.
[time=1712] What did I see?
[time=1713] Don't know.
[time=1714] Did I see that?
[time=1715] Could it be?
[time=1716] I don't know.
[time=1717] That's doubts.
[time=1718] So it makes sense.
[time=1720] Verse 39, "Please." This is the first time he says this, "See my hands and my feet.
[time=1730] It's I, myself." He doesn't just say it's me, so it's I, myself, it's really me.
[time=1736] Touch me and see, for spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.
[time=1744] In this verse is the first time that he says that he has hands and feet.
[time=1748] So the next verse, Luke says it for Jesus, he says he shows him his hands and his feet.
[time=1754] First John 1-1 is a familiar verse to you.
[time=1757] It says this, "That which is from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands." There are different words for touch in Greek, but the one used here is not this word like touch.
[time=1772] Like, oh, okay.
[time=1774] It's a word that means to handle, to get a grasp on, to really embrace.
[time=1780] And the word he uses for touch here is that second word, isn't like the, I guess it's Jesus.
[time=1785] Is it you, Jesus?
[time=1786] And he kind of leans in like, okay, that's not, it's no handling word.
[time=1790] It's touch me and see.
[time=1793] It's really me.
[time=1795] I would not be too hard for you to imagine hugs going on in this context.
[time=1799] In their fear, right?
[time=1802] A spirit can't hug you.
[time=1803] I don't think a spirit can hug you.
[time=1806] Rick, can a spirit hug you?
[time=1808] I don't think so.
[time=1809] I don't think spirits give hugs or ghosts anyway.
[time=1813] Actual Jesus gives an actual hug.
[time=1814] Jill Caratini is a writer for Robbie Zacharias International Ministries, and she wrote this about this phrase, hands and feet.
[time=1824] Why would he show them his hands and his feet?
[time=1827] Why would he do that?
[time=1831] The scars were on his hands and his feet from being crucified, and he still carries those
[time=1837] scars today.
[time=1838] Listen to what she says in this quote, "Christ was recognized by the scars that marked his
[time=1844] body and shouted of his love." Would you mind writing that somewhere in your notes that Jesus scars, shout of his love?
[time=1855] He is himself insists on his actual resurrection.
[time=1860] I really was dead, guys.
[time=1862] I'm really alive again.
[time=1865] The powerful lyrics of musician Michael Card exclaimed, "The marks of death that God chose never to erase, the wounds of love's eternal war.
[time=1874] When the kingdom comes with his perfected sons, he will be known by the scars.
[time=1880] He still carries them today." Why?
[time=1884] He is a reminder of God's great love.
[time=1887] Like our own, but far beyond this, the scars of Christ point us to a sovereign God who goes great links to touch our disfigured world and scarred souls with his holy hands.
[time=1900] As the prophet Isaiah proclaimed long ago, he was crushed for our iniquities by his stripes.
[time=1907] We are healed.
[time=1908] No doubt.
[time=1910] Because this piercing reality of Christ bearing the scars of our sin, carrying our pain, taking
[time=1916] our shame, the Peter born minus, he dynamically instructed through all your anxieties upon
[time=1922] him because he cares about you, Peter of all people knew.
[time=1928] He knew.
[time=1933] When he had said this, verse 40, when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his
[time=1940] feet.
[time=1941] He says it a second time.
[time=1942] See, my hands and my feet and the Luke instructs it again, he actually does what he goes on to say that he intends to do.
[time=1949] Here's my hands and my feet, guys, it's really me.
[time=1952] It's really me.
[time=1953] Why is he so insistent of his own resurrection?
[time=1958] It's important.
[time=1959] It's a model for us.
[time=1960] They still, verse 41, disbelieved for joy.
[time=1966] What's disbelieved for joy mean?
[time=1969] Where shall I knock?
[time=1970] I'll knock over here.
[time=1973] Mr. Webster?
[time=1974] Yeah.
[time=1975] I'm from publishers clearing house.
[time=1977] I have a $10 million check for you.
[time=1978] I'm like, no way.
[time=1981] That's too good to be true.
[time=1984] That's just it.
[time=1985] Disbelieving for joy is a point at which you say that can't possibly be true.
[time=1990] No way.
[time=1991] $10 million for you.
[time=1994] There you go.
[time=1995] Disbelieving for joy.
[time=1996] That's exactly what it means.
[time=1998] Same way that Jacob felt about Joseph, when after many, many years, he realized he was
[time=2004] alive again.
[time=2006] He disbelieved for joy.
[time=2007] Rhoda, remember her, the servant girl in the book of Acts, Peter knocks in the door.
[time=2013] We're knocking on the door.
[time=2014] Peter knocks in the door and says, "Hey Rhoda, it's me." I'm paraphrasing here.
[time=2018] "Hey Rhoda, it's me." And Rhoda goes, "Oh wow, it's Peter." And she runs away and doesn't even let him in.
[time=2023] She sees him to the people, probably wasn't a people there, but if there was, she looked through it and said, and just ran away and so excited.
[time=2030] She couldn't believe it was actually, because he was in jail, by the way, and he was locked up when he couldn't get out, or so it was thought.
[time=2037] Disbelieved for joy.
[time=2038] Let me put it to you this way for the disciples.
[time=2042] Imagine that you're a rabbi who chose you out of an insignificant little life to create
[time=2048] a new Israel around himself, who called you to be with him, to go out and preach in his name, to have authority over unclean spirits, who does great acts of power that only Yahweh and you'll test them it can do.
[time=2059] This rabbi institutes a new covenant in his blood at your Passover meal just days before,
[time=2066] then he sings with you, prays with you, in your beloved special place, your garden.
[time=2071] He was arrested, rarrowed through a mock trial, beaten, whipped, humiliated, scorned, butchered
[time=2078] on a cross, laid to rest in a real tomb, guarded by real guards, mind you, covered over by
[time=2086] a real stone, sealed with a real seal of a real governor of a real place.
[time=2092] That same rabbi who was dead, he's alive again.
[time=2096] They can't believe it.
[time=2098] They disbelieved for joy.
[time=2100] They were overwhelmed.
[time=2101] They were amazed.
[time=2102] They marveled, it says in that verse.
[time=2106] They marveled.
[time=2107] We marvel too, don't we?
[time=2110] At the reality of the resurrection in our lives today, and in May, and in June, and July,
[time=2120] all through the summer months, he is alive and all his promises are true and that will
[time=2126] sustain you in your life when you have bad days and you will have bad days and there will be tragedy.
[time=2132] It's not just a metaphor.
[time=2135] Makes you feel better, no, but it certainly does.
[time=2140] Encourage us to know that our Savior loves and he lives, as the songwriter says, and he is always there for us.
[time=2147] Isn't that encouraging?
[time=2151] Verse 42, so the end of verse 41 says, if you'll excuse me, says, "You got anything to eat?"
[time=2161] It's funny in the Greek, it says, "You have anything edible?" I don't know, Rick, again, if spirits give hugs, but I don't think they have stomachs, either.
[time=2170] I'm not an expert on that, but he wants something to eat, and he says in verse 41, "The given piece of broiled fish, he took it and he ate it before then."
[time=2180] Would you write down 1 Corinthians 15, it's an entire chapter where Paul lays out the necessity
[time=2186] of believing in the resurrection, and Jesus and Luke records those details.
[time=2192] Why would he include this stuff about fish and eating it?
[time=2194] It's the big deal.
[time=2195] I submit to you, it's a very big deal because he has a body, and you and I are raised, we
[time=2202] are raised with him, to life, we'll have bodies, too.
[time=2206] Not spirits, not ghosts, but actual, physical, glorified bodies like he has.
[time=2211] Amazing, amazing.
[time=2215] The first thing to know from this passage is that Jesus really is risen from the dead.
[time=2219] The second major point for us is these three verses that Jesus fulfills everything in the Scriptures.
[time=2224] There is nothing deficient in any way about his message.
[time=2229] Everything filled in the Scriptures is done through Jesus and because of him.
[time=2234] Everything there.
[time=2235] Look at verse 44 with me.
[time=2236] He said to them, "These are my words, my words." If you're inclined to mark in your Bible, did you underline that?
[time=2244] My words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me
[time=2251] in the law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms, that's the order in the Hebrew Old Testament, must be fulfilled.
[time=2260] Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures and said to them, "It's written that the Christ should suffer on the third day rise from the dead." The word fulfilled in verse 44 means to bring to a designed end.
[time=2275] He isn't figuring it out as he goes.
[time=2279] Like, "Oh, yeah, I probably should go up to Jerusalem, that's where the Messiah is supposed to die." That sounds right.
[time=2284] The good thing I was born in Bethlehem, that's kind of convenient because that's where the Messiah is supposed to be born.
[time=2290] There are people who actually believe that, I am not one of them, fulfilled, designed
[time=2297] to end.
[time=2298] Let's walk through the law of the prophets and the writings real quickly this morning.
[time=2301] Jesus in these verses, if you're taking notes, before everything in the Scriptures, he refers
[time=2307] to his own words, my words among you.
[time=2312] His fulfillment was, we also observed this, it was complete and it was necessary.
[time=2317] It says in verse 44 that those things must be fulfilled.
[time=2324] Beautiful stuff here, friends.
[time=2325] How many of you saw the passion of the Christ?
[time=2327] Would you raise your hand if you saw the passion of the Christ?
[time=2329] Many of you, I would say probably most of you saw that.
[time=2331] Remember in the early scenes when in the garden Jesus crushes the snake's head?
[time=2336] Do you remember that?
[time=2339] Okay.
[time=2340] That's from Genesis 3.15 where the seed of the serpent will strike the heel, the seed
[time=2346] of the woman, and the seed of the woman will crush the serpent's head, fulfilled in Jesus.
[time=2352] That he will cause him to suffer, but he will crush Satan.
[time=2356] That's already taken place.
[time=2358] Satan has been crushed at the cross, rendered powerless to prevent God's salvation from going to the ends of the earth.
[time=2365] That's pretty wonderful.
[time=2366] Genesis 12, 3 says that Abraham's seed will be a blessing to the whole earth.
[time=2372] Law of Moses.
[time=2373] This is a very fast trip through, the Old Testament.
[time=2376] Okay.
[time=2377] Prophets.
[time=2378] Isaiah 50, verses 5 and 6, Yahweh Elohim, the Lord God has opened my ear.
[time=2385] I was not rebellious.
[time=2386] I turned not backward.
[time=2387] I gave my back to those who strike and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard.
[time=2392] I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting.
[time=2396] When Jesus tells Peter, he has to suffer, what does Peter do?
[time=2401] In the famous passage about, he rebukes, Jesus says, "No, no, no, this never happened to you.
[time=2407] That will never happen." And what does Jesus say to Peter in response?
[time=2411] Get behind me, Satan.
[time=2414] He insists that these things must happen to him.
[time=2417] He must suffer.
[time=2418] And friends, he did it anyway.
[time=2421] He knew it had to happen.
[time=2422] His suffering at great cost to himself, he did it anyway.
[time=2427] Unbelievable.
[time=2428] The end of Isaiah 52 says this, "Behold, my servant shall act wisely.
[time=2434] He will be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted, as many as it were astonished at you.
[time=2438] His appearance was so marred beyond human semblance, Isaiah 52, 14.
[time=2443] And his form, beyond that of the children of mankind, so shall he sprinkle many nations.
[time=2448] Kings shall shut their mouths because of him.
[time=2451] For that which has not been told them they see, and that which they have not heard they understand.
[time=2457] Violence has come to visit us, I mentioned earlier, violence has come to visit Fort Wayne.
[time=2463] How does God answer violence?
[time=2465] How does he feel about it?
[time=2467] Habakkuk asked that question, "How long, O Lord, how you can hear it in his voice?
[time=2472] How long must I cry to you?
[time=2476] Violence, and you won't answer." God's answer to violence, to injustice, is the cross, and the death of his son.
[time=2488] God is not immune to violence.
[time=2490] He's not deaf to your cries or my cries.
[time=2494] And through his son's death, he purchased our redemption.
[time=2497] Only through his son's death could it be purchased.
[time=2500] And it only has meaning in the light of those things.
[time=2503] In the Psalms, we read Psalm 118, if you'd go there with me please, this is the famous Hosea passage, Psalm 118 verse 22, "Lav Moses, prophets, Psalms."
[time=2517] Everything was fulfilled about Jesus.
[time=2520] For example, Psalm 118, starting in verse 22.
[time=2526] The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
[time=2531] This is the Lord's doing its marvelous in our eyes.
[time=2535] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[time=2538] Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[time=2542] Save us, Hosea, we pray, O Lord, O Lord, we pray, give us success.
[time=2548] They would sing those Psalms going up to Jerusalem for celebration, and it's about Jesus.
[time=2556] The Old Testament scriptures, everything was fulfilled in the person of Jesus, Jesus himself.
[time=2565] This fulfillment was through himself.
[time=2568] That's the next point I would ask you to write down in the notes.
[time=2570] The Hosea fulfillment was in his own words.
[time=2572] It was complete, it was necessary, but it was also through himself.
[time=2577] All things written about me are concerning me, they were all fulfilled.
[time=2582] So you can't separate Jesus from Christianity and have anything left.
[time=2587] Other major world religions, you can take their leader away and you'll be fine.
[time=2591] You can't take Jesus away from Christianity and have anything left.
[time=2595] It's empty.
[time=2598] May we never do so.
[time=2599] Verse 45, Luke 24, 45.
[time=2606] Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures.
[time=2609] He opened their minds.
[time=2611] Probably less of you have seen this movie, but the sixth sense, and we've seen that movie, the balcony properly, we've seen more and more of that.
[time=2619] M. Night Shyamalan, a movie called The Sixth Sense.
[time=2623] This is a spoiler alert.
[time=2624] Okay, so if you haven't seen it, I'm going to spoil it, the ending for you.
[time=2628] So stay tuned.
[time=2629] He makes very, very hitch cocky in movies, very suspenseful.
[time=2634] So that isn't your cup of tea, then you can disregard this message altogether.
[time=2638] But anyway, in the movie, the main character is dead the whole time.
[time=2644] And you don't really know it until the end.
[time=2646] My wife knows early because she watches films, I'll get that right away.
[time=2648] And I'm like an hour in, I'm like, I don't know what's going on here.
[time=2651] And she's already got to figure it out an hour ago.
[time=2652] But pedestrians like me, we can't figure it out.
[time=2656] But that's the end of the movie.
[time=2657] He's dead the whole time.
[time=2658] You're like, oh, now I get it.
[time=2660] Why can't she see him?
[time=2662] He thinks he doesn't know that he's dead though in the movie.
[time=2665] Very interesting stuff.
[time=2666] In a much greater way, in Luke 2445, he opens their minds to understand what's going
[time=2672] on.
[time=2673] The ending is revealed to them as a 53.
[time=2678] Oh, and now it all comes together for them in this glorious moment.
[time=2684] And we have the benefit of thousands of years of history that they didn't have.
[time=2688] But now we know.
[time=2692] And to you right, as a marvelous quote about this, in his book, The Resurrection of the Son of God.
[time=2697] What the Gospel of Luke is designed to do at a large scale to tell a story of Jesus in the early church.
[time=2703] So it's positioned at the climax, the high point of Israel's scriptural story can be fully understood and appropriated.
[time=2713] Jesus enables the disciples to do close up.
[time=2717] They are to understand the Bible in a whole new way in light of the events that have happened
[time=2723] to him.
[time=2724] And they are to make this we and they are to make this fresh reading of Scripture the source of their inner life of burning zeal and their framework for understanding who Jesus was and
[time=2735] is.
[time=2736] They are in relation to him and what they must do as a result.
[time=2739] That's the whole message right there.
[time=2742] Who is Jesus?
[time=2743] What did he do?
[time=2744] Now what should I do?
[time=2745] That's the message this morning from Luke 24.
[time=2748] The word in verse 45 for open is used elsewhere.
[time=2751] It's used in Mark 7 when a man's ears are open, who is deaf.
[time=2755] It's used in Acts chapter 2 verse 23 where the womb is opened by the first born.
[time=2763] It's used in Acts 16 where the Lord opens Lydia's heart to hear what Paul is teaching.
[time=2769] So the word seems to mean that it was made to do and it was made to do.
[time=2775] It works the way it's supposed to work.
[time=2777] Their minds were opened and they understood.
[time=2781] It's beautiful to watch, ears that were deaf are unstopped, wombs that were closed are
[time=2787] opened and on hearts that could not believe, minds that couldn't understand are opened
[time=2793] to see all by God himself.
[time=2798] The third point, the first point was that he really is risen from the dead in your notes.
[time=2801] The second point was that he fulfilled everything in the Scriptures.
[time=2804] The third takeaway this morning for you, three takeaways.
[time=2807] He is risen.
[time=2808] The Scriptures are all fulfilled about him.
[time=2810] Thirdly, we are commissioned.
[time=2812] We are commissioned together to proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in his name.
[time=2818] That's the takeaway.
[time=2819] That's the go part of the message.
[time=2821] Look at verse 47 with me if you would please.
[time=2826] And that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations
[time=2832] beginning from Jerusalem.
[time=2835] James 1.27 says religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this, to
[time=2841] visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
[time=2846] Religion that is pure and undefiled.
[time=2847] The word for religion there is the word that means what you do in your worship.
[time=2853] What you do in your worship matters.
[time=2856] It's demonstrated by your actions.
[time=2858] That's religion.
[time=2859] It's not something you think up here but as no relation to your actual real life.
[time=2863] That's a very weird idea that we seem to have adopted in America these days.
[time=2866] You can believe it up here but never shows up in your life.
[time=2869] No.
[time=2870] In Africa right now our friends are ministering to orphans.
[time=2877] And they are practicing this verse for all to see their religion and by religion we only mean their expression of devotion to God in worship by visiting orphans and their distress.
[time=2888] We're going to pray for them now.
[time=2891] Doug Crane told me after the first service that Kelly wasn't feeling very well, he's having some stomach flu issues.
[time=2896] Would you join me and pray with them these dear friends of ours?
[time=2900] Please join me in praying for them right now and especially for Kelly's he's not feeling very well this morning.
[time=2905] Let's pause for a moment and we'll pray together.
[time=2907] Would you please?
[time=2908] Oh Lord thank you for today.
[time=2911] Thank you for your word and for your son Jesus.
[time=2914] I pray God as these dear friends minister in Jesus' name to these orphans and widows
[time=2920] in Africa that you would go before them and keep them safe.
[time=2922] God that you give Kelly strength in his body.
[time=2926] Even this moment give him rest, give him strength to do what you've called him to do.
[time=2930] Lord may we be faithful in prayer for these again dear friends as they're gone.
[time=2936] We ask you father to go before us.
[time=2938] Help us to understand your son has risen from the dead.
[time=2943] The scriptures are fulfilled in his name and that we are in all called to go and preach this wonderful message of repentance and forgiveness of sins in his name.
[time=2950] We pray this in his name and for his sake on then.
[time=2959] The passage ends with the Holy Spirit and I want to take you to that if I could please.
[time=2965] Verse 48.
[time=2968] You are witnesses of these things and behold I'm sending the promise of my father upon
[time=2974] you but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.
[time=2981] I want to read you a story or an illustration from Martin Lloyd Jones in his book Joy and
[time=2988] Speakable about what it means to when the Holy Spirit comes upon a person and I'll end
[time=2994] with this.
[time=2996] It's like a child walking along holding his father's hand.
[time=2999] All is well the child is happy.
[time=3002] He feels secure.
[time=3003] His father loves him.
[time=3004] He believes that his father loves him but there's no unusual urge to talk about this or sing about it.
[time=3009] It's true and it's pleasant.
[time=3011] Then suddenly the father throws the child by reaching down and sweeping up into his arms and hugging him tightly and kissing him on the neck and whispering I love you so much.
[time=3023] And then holding the stunned child back so we can look into his face and saying with all his heart I am so glad you are mine.
[time=3031] Hugging him once more, unspeakable warmth and affection puts the child down to keep walking.
[time=3038] This Lloyd Jones says is what happens when a person is baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[time=3043] A pleasant and happy walk with God has swept up into an unspeakable new level of joy and love and assurance and reality that leaves the Christian so utterly certain of the immediate reality of Jesus that he is overflowing as we will be in just a few moments in song in
[time=3058] praise and more free and bold in witness than he ever imagined he could be.
[time=3063] The child is simply stunned.
[time=3064] He doesn't know whether to cry or shout or fall down or run.
[time=3070] He is so happy.
[time=3072] The fuses of love are so overloaded they almost blow out.
