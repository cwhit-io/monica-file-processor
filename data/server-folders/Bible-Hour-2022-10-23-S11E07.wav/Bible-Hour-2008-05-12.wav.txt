[time=452] Well hello again everybody welcome to the Bible hour we're thankful to have you here with us on the broadcast today.
[time=458] I want to just say a couple things about an amazing group of people who I have an enormous amount of respect for and personally an enormous amount of gratitude for and that is the team of people here at Black Hawk that give themselves in the area of student ministries.
[time=476] Jesse Hannah is our student ministry pastor and Jesse and his team many of them volunteers a few of them page staff but I tell you what all of them absolutely phenomenal people who give themselves literally 24/7 most of you know when you're dealing with students it's not just a nine to five thing and I'm so grateful for our student ministry team so thankful for the investment that they make in the lives of kids from all over this community.
[time=505] I'm thankful this morning on the broadcast it was a Sunday just this past Sunday where our worship pastor Corbin Miller I think was at another church leading worship and giving himself in that setting we were privileged to have our student ministry band and our our student ministry folks step in and lead our church in worship and it was as it always is so encouraging not only just to worship God together
[time=534] as it always is but so encouraging in a special sense that to have students literally leading us to sense and to see their passion to sense and to see their excitement for what they're doing it was really really encouraging and I just want you to know as you watch and as you see them
[time=552] God's doing some really really encouraging things very special things here in our student ministries on Wednesday nights at 730 there's a student gathering called 212 and would love for you if you have students if you have friends who have high school age students would love for them to come and be a part of that they would be welcomed
[time=573] and they'd really really enjoyed a great time of worship and teaching on Wednesday nights for students and then liquid is our middle school ministry sixth seventh and eighth grade meets on Sunday mornings first hour at nine o'clock
[time=587] would love for you to encourage any middle school students any parents of middle school students that you know send them our way we'd love to make an investment in those students lives would love to come alongside those families and encourage them so enjoy this morning
[time=602] as our students lead worship thank you so much for your prayers and your support and we'll hope to see you soon God bless you have a great week
[time=632] that saved a wretch like me
[time=640] and I once was lost but now I was blind but now I see
[time=655] it was grace that taught my heart to give and grace my fears were near
[time=670] and I'm passionate that grace will be the hour I first believe
[time=684] my chains are gone, I've been temporary, I got myself your hands on me and light above this mercy range of ending love
[time=709] amazing grace
[time=715] the Lord has promised good to me his word my hope secures
[time=732] he will my shield and for trusty as long as life enters
[time=746] my chains are gone, I've been temporary, I got myself your hands on me and light above this mercy range of ending love
[time=800] amazing grace
[time=808] you shall assume desire to shine but the light who comes with me below will be forever mine
[time=837] will be forever mine
[time=845] you are forever mine
[time=851] watching the love I've been temporary, I got myself your hands on me
[time=866] and light above this mercy range of ending love
[time=876] amazing grace watching the love I've been temporary, I got myself your hands on me and light above this mercy range of ending love
[time=932] but ending love amazing grace
[time=942] as we are and most of you around here, Black Hawk know we are to the biblical concept of the priesthood of all believers
[time=952] we believe God's word is really clear that those that know him, those that have come into a fully surrendered relationship with him
[time=960] have been made by him to be a what the scriptures call a royal priesthood we are designed by God to pass him along his love and his grace and his truth to others
[time=972] and as committed as we are to doing that with our students and I hope that was encouraging for you this morning
[time=978] we are so grateful for these kids and I'm so grateful for the ministry God's given us with them as we try to encourage them and as they respond and as they show us again and again as John Newmeister said
[time=989] their willingness to go change the world and pass him along to others I'm really grateful for that and as thankful as I am for that I'm also grateful that we are trying our best to be priests
[time=1001] that pass his love and compassion and grace along to others not only here but across the world and many of you know that it was just a few weeks ago that I had the privilege of being part of a team from Black Hawk
[time=1012] and I got to go to the other side of the world to a place called Nairobi Kenya and I want to invite Amanda and Stephanie if they'd come up right now too big of a team to get everybody up here but over the next couple weeks I promised you you'd get to hear from a few of them
[time=1030] and I'm so grateful for Stephanie Stephanie Struck is part of our team here at Black Hawk she gives guidance and oversight to our global ministries team Amanda is a senior here at Black Hawk Christian High School and I had the joy and it really was a joy
[time=1043] to be with these gals and the rest of our team one of the great blessings of the trip was getting to know them better
[time=1050] and they got to know me better and I think that was probably a little disappointing form at points along the way
[time=1056] but we had a great great time and I just wanted them to share just briefly with all of you this morning
[time=1062] some of what God taught them and I think they just want to encourage you and thank you for your support so I'll start with Stephanie and then she can give it to Amanda go right ahead good morning I'm so thankful that we had this opportunity and I'm thankful to all of you for your prayers and your support
[time=1077] and encouragement and I can't wait for more of you to go in the next couple years something I realized over the last couple weeks is that somehow the ten of us whose faces are in these fantastic pictures
[time=1089] they picked the best one for today and we get credit for going and for getting out of plane
[time=1095] and doing something big and we seem to get a lot of credit for doing these things but I really have been praying that God gets all the credit and it's because of him that we have anything to give
[time=1105] and it's because of what he's done in our hearts that we have a desire to go and he's given us the hands and feet to serve him and he's given us this relationship with new life homes
[time=1116] and we're so thankful and we just pray that he gets all the credit from our stories and our pictures and that we would reflect who Christ is and his glory and all of this something that God taught me on the trip was through a little girl named Zoe and before the trip God had put on my heart to read Psalm 139 and really be thinking about that
[time=1137] keeping in mind the kids that we were going to spend time with and it says there that he knit her together and her mother's womb and he knows when she rises and when she sits and all of her days are in his book before they ever come to be and we tried so hard every day to remember all of the kids' names
[time=1157] and we felt like we were doing great until the next day when they all had new outfits on and we had to start over and I kept thinking of the song he knows my name and he sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call and God has so much value for each one of those kids and I got really attached to this little girl Zoe and her big brown eyes would just stare at me every time I walked into the crawler's unit where she was she was always on the floor playing by herself and so I'd pick her up and she kind of begged me with her eyes to just cuddle her and I had a really good time with this little girl and a couple days in someone said that she was special needs
[time=1196] and I think it was due to cerebral palsy and maybe I had noticed but I don't think it had really clicked for me that she was bigger than all the other kids and not yet walking and God just gave me his eyes to see her as he does and see how much value he has for her and all the kids in that room the same and through the week we found out she had some medical things and we started to learn about other kids that were HIV positive and God really gave me his heart and showed me that he has so much value for each one of those kids
[time=1228] and they're each created in the image of him and I've just been praying since we are back that our stories and everything that God has done in our heart
[time=1238] that he would use us and continue to grow this church to understand the value that he has for those that the world calls the least and as she gets older and the gap widens between her age and her development the world is going to tell her she has less value but God has so much value for her and I pray that we would really keep growing in that understanding of how much value he has
[time=1260] for those that the world calls the least Well I think you can tell by the picture that I was the youngest one on the team
[time=1269] but I enjoyed it was a little weird at first but I enjoyed getting to know everyone
[time=1276] I've always enjoyed little kids but I've never been the type of person that walks into a room
[time=1283] and immediately kids will be drawn to them and so I was a little nervous about spending a week with kids but the second day we were at the orphanage this little boy named Ken came up to me
[time=1296] and held his arms up and said up and he wanted to be picked up so I picked it up and immediately
[time=1302] fell asleep on my shoulder and I just felt in those five minutes that I got to hold him
[time=1309] while he was sleeping I just felt blessed by God and I just felt the love of God being poured out on me
[time=1316] through this little one and a half year old and in that moment I knew that this is what we were here for
[time=1323] this is what I was here for to show the love of God and return to this little boy for these five minutes
[time=1331] it doesn't matter how far we come how much money it cost but this is what we're supposed to be doing
[time=1337] and I just felt so blessed and it's my hope and my prayer that one day everyone gets to experience
[time=1344] the blessing of the love of a child and the desire of a child to be held it was wonderful I enjoyed it a lot
[time=1354] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1364] really was a blessing and like I said to you a couple weeks ago I can't wait for you to go I can't wait for many of you in the days to come to be given the opportunity to go with us we're going to keep going and while we're as devoted as ever and as committed as we've ever been
[time=1380] to going to Fort Wayne and to the needs that are represented right here in our own community
[time=1386] we're going to continue to do our best to go as it says there in Acts 1 8 you know to the ends of the earth
[time=1392] and we're thankful many in our family have gone many of you are committed to continuing to go
[time=1399] and we can't wait to come up alongside you and support you in that and I think God's got some great things for us
[time=1405] as we give ourselves to his design for ministry hey last week I just kind of posed a question and I want to can't I've been looking forward to this can't wait to jump into this with you this morning the question we asked last week was what can we learn from the first church and more specifically I asked the question last week that someone kind of asked me they said why are you so fascinated
[time=1426] with why recently such a preoccupation with the first church and if you were here last week we just kind of
[time=1434] briefly got into it and the idea basically was this that whether it's a marriage or whether it's a relationship or whether it's a company I mean it usually stands to reason that five 10 15 years into it it might be a good idea
[time=1448] to periodically come back to our beginning back to this point in time where we were clear on who we were going to be
[time=1456] and what we were going to do and the direction we were going to move in the kind of relationship we were going to have
[time=1462] this was this all came clear to me in another really powerful way over the weekend it was yesterday Saturday
[time=1470] and it was time after a morning soccer game to come back to the house and give ourselves to a day of yard work
[time=1478] there was grass that needed to be mowed there were bushes that needed to be trimmed there was a lot that needed to be done
[time=1484] and we got an old John Deere mower and it's pretty old I don't know how old it is but it's old and it's just been kind of plugging along
[time=1493] ever since we moved out to the house we've had it and it really is on the older side and it's done pretty well but I'll tell you what
[time=1501] yesterday I went out and looked underneath it and to say there was a puddle of oil would probably be saying it lightly
[time=1508] and I had just put some in a couple days ago and the oil doesn't drip through this thing it just kind of runs
[time=1516] and it's like literally flowing out of the garage and I know this isn't good and my kids know it's not good
[time=1522] and again I'm in this tension if you know me there's this tension where I'm not really good with fixing stuff I don't really know what I do what I'm doing I keep my tools in a Tupperware container that's a very embarrassing thing to say but it's just true and I'm old and my hair's grey and I'm coming to terms with who I am
[time=1540] and I keep my tools in a Tupperware thing so I get my Tupperware thing out and I'm actually going to look inside
[time=1547] see I want to impress my kids I want my wife to think I'm a man so I go out there with my tools and I'm going to open up this lawn mower
[time=1555] and I'm going to figure this thing out well I have no idea what I'm doing I have no idea where I'm going I just know something's not right in there
[time=1561] well I opened the thing I finally I was very proud of myself I figured out how to get the panel off the side I'm digging around in there I got a rag you know my hands are all oily and I look in there I wasn't sure where to look
[time=1574] I just I saw what looked like an oil filter I saw where the I saw where it was drippy I saw where the nineteen drips were coming down
[time=1583] I kind of looked in that area and it's just covered it's just covered it's covered with oil there's just oil everywhere inside there
[time=1594] and I don't know a thing but I kind of know enough to know it probably shouldn't be that oily everywhere and it looked bad it looked really really bad
[time=1604] and so they're asking me what dad would you find well I you know it's not good you know and I'm acting like I'm diagnosing the thing
[time=1614] here's my here's my thought there was a day I don't know how many years ago when the inside of that John Deere looked sweet it was clean
[time=1627] you know there was a day when that thing wasn't dripping and there was a day when that thing was running really really smooth
[time=1633] there was a day when I could have looked inside that thing and it wouldn't have been all gookie and oily and drippy and sludgy
[time=1641] and and that was a good day and and and it's exactly why I'm so very interested in looking inside the word of God and trying to again see this picture of the church
[time=1657] I'm not saying the church is broken I'm not saying the church is all gookie and sludgy I'm not saying it's dripping oil like a sieve I'm just saying after 2,000 years
[time=1667] might it be a good idea periodically to come back to this original picture and design and see how it is that God designed the first church
[time=1677] and for me it's been incredibly encouraging it's been very challenging and I want to do my very best
[time=1684] to communicate to each and every one of us that calls this place home a picture of God's design before anything got cracked
[time=1693] before anything came loose before anything started to get a little ugly I want you to see what it looked like there were some things that he did
[time=1701] there were some things that this first band of Christ followers gave themselves to there were some priorities there were some values there were some decisions that got made right out of the gate
[time=1713] that provide us with a really really powerful picture of what life was like in this first church this first church my friends what can we learn from the first church as you read through
[time=1725] and I want to just invite you if you were to open up to Acts chapter 2 PowerPoint I'm going to just read through this passage if you can follow along great
[time=1733] and then I want to show you some things that they were committed to some things I believe you and I as a family need to be deeply committed to
[time=1741] in the days to come acts to fall my start in verse 41 would you stand in honor of God's word and can I just read this to you before we begin this morning so then those who had received his word Peter gives his sermon right 3000 people come to faith
[time=1757] and it says in verse 41 it says so then those who had received his word were baptized and that day they were added about 3000 souls
[time=1766] they were continually verse 42 they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching and a fellowship to the breaking of bread and a prayer
[time=1775] everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles
[time=1782] and all those who had believed were what say it out loud together and they had all things in common and they began selling their property in possessions and were sharing them with all as anyone might have need
[time=1795] day by day wow day by day continuing with one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house were taking their meals say it out loud
[time=1809] with gladness and sincerity of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord and the Lord was adding to their number day by day
[time=1818] those who were being saved. Father God we stand humbly before you this morning and we ask God that you would again paint a picture for us many in the room have seen the picture
[time=1829] God many in the room for years have been acquainted with this picture of your design or this first church for others in the room this morning
[time=1838] this morning God this is all new and as we talk about not so much how a church should be formed but instead God how a church should function
[time=1850] as we think about God and as we give our heart and as we're open God to you speaking to us regarding the way in which we should give ourselves to this great endeavor
[time=1859] oh God I pray that you would do a mighty work in our hearts and in our minds God that you would do something special in us individually and God in us as a family
[time=1870] oh God may we understand clearly how it is you designed this church to function and God the role that you have for us in that and God may we give ourselves to that
[time=1882] may we apply these truths in the days and weeks and months to come in your son's name we pray amen you can be seated
[time=1892] well let me just let me just show you some things here as we read through the text as you work your way through not only Acts 2 but the first few chapters of Acts it becomes very clear that the church did a few things number one they gathered my friends
[time=1904] this first church was a gathering church this first church loved to felt the need to be and we'll talk a little bit more about this later but this first church was a church that loved and they were deeply devoted to being together
[time=1920] they gathered they were they were also and I think you'll see on the slides here not only were they a church that gathered but they were at church well actually we're gonna get to that in a moment let me just get back to gathering three things they gathered look at this they gathered to receive teaching
[time=1937] I want you to notice this we're gonna look at this here in the next few minutes they gathered to receive teaching they gathered not only to receive teaching but just to simply be together and they also gathered to encounter God they gathered as a family again and again to experience the presence of God
[time=1955] and I want you to go back to this first I want you to go back to this first point my friends this first church the early church they were a people that gathered to receive teaching
[time=1965] they were a people who gathered because they knew how important it was for them to receive instruction they were a people who wanted desperately to know God's mind and God's heart they realized the stakes were high they knew this was a crucial time and they were a family that gathered
[time=1982] and in their gathering first and foremost we see them engaged in this teaching this receiving of teaching and I want to talk to you just for a moment about that you know and I want to just kind of give you a backdrop here there has always been think about it with me
[time=1995] there has always been from the beginning the beginning of human history a need for us to receive instruction we have always had from the very beginning this need to receive God's instruction to listen to and receive God's words
[time=2013] this need has existed for the most part because there has always been a competing voice as well from the beginning there has always been a competing voice in opposition to God's attempting to move us away from that which is true
[time=2028] if you go back to the very beginning in the garden the garden of Eden as Satan begins his assault on the human heart the one thing he attacked with great intensity was the veracity and the validity of God's words
[time=2043] God had said clearly God knew that Adam and Eve were in desperate need of hearing his words and so God said to them if you eat of the fruit of these trees you'll live he said to them if you eat of the fruit of this tree you'll die
[time=2059] you can eat there you shouldn't eat here he communicates to them he clearly communicates his instruction he gives them direction they were from the very beginning in need of this you and I from the very beginning have been in need of hearing God's voice later
[time=2076] if you start to make your way through the Old Testament as God does his best to establish a redemptive community in the form of the nation of Israel and as we read on in the scriptural account about God's foundational design
[time=2089] for Israel's success we see the same principle at work we see that the passing along of God's truth the passing along of God's words this opportunity for people to be instructed by the very words of God we see it as paramount
[time=2109] in God's plan to have a people who would live with strength and character among the nations and that was God's design for the nation of Israel that they would be a country that they would be a people who would live with strength and character amongst the nations
[time=2126] and in this design to have them do that as you look at the scriptures you see that their foundational in that plan is this notion of those people having the words of God the teaching of God instruction from God passed along look at Deuteronomy 6 if you will Deuteronomy chapter 6 you see it right there in verses 1 and 2 now this Moses here speaking to the people of Israel
[time=2153] he says now this is the commandment the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God has commanded me to teach you that you might do them in the land where you are going over to possess it he goes on in verse 2 to say so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the Lord your God to keep all his statutes and his commandments
[time=2177] which I command you all the days of your life and that your days may be prolonged all of this from the teaching the passing along the people's need to hear the voice of God says in verse 6 he says these words which I am commanding you today shall be on your heart
[time=2196] and in verse 7 it says and you shall there it is you shall teach them pass them along diligently to your sons and you shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up interesting if you go back just go back to Deuteronomy 4
[time=2215] look at Deuteronomy 4 10 remember the day here again Moses talking to the people remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Orib when the Lord said to me assemble the people even back then it was a priority of God's to have his people his redemptive community he wanted them periodically to assemble to be together together he says the Lord said to me assemble the people to me that I may let them what?
[time=2243] let them hear my words so they may learn to fear me all the days they live on the earth and that they may teach their children it has been part of God's design from the beginning that there would be a people that those people would gather that those people having gathered would receive teaching
[time=2264] now fast forward to Acts 2 now we're at God's new redemptive community now the nation of Israel failed in their unfaithfulness they failed to be the chosen race the chosen people the priests that would affect the nations they didn't do so well there so God puts them on the side for a while now comes the church in Acts 2 the new redemptive community and we see the exact same principle at work yet again
[time=2291] look at Acts 2 what has transpired is we turn to Acts 2 what have we seen in recent days in our after Easter study we've seen that there are 3,000 new believers in a church recently indwelt by the Holy Spirit that according to the Lord Himself an Acts 1 8 now has out in front of them this call to witness to proclaim to share to live out the gospel in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and the outermost parts of the world
[time=2320] and with all of that as a backdrop what do we find them first and foremost engaged in the text says they were Acts 2 they were coming together to constantly we looked at that word a couple weeks ago they were obstinate they were persistently obstinate in their devotion to coming together to constantly hear the words of God to constantly subject themselves to the instruction being passed away
[time=2349] and being passed along by the apostles Acts 2 42 we just read it first part there they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching
[time=2360] look at verse 44 again a commitment to gather and all those who had believed were together all of them who believed were on a regular basis together that phrase there that word in that verse has not only connotations in terms of spiritually they were like one but no it also has physical
[time=2378] connotations they were a people who were together verse 46 day by day continuing with one mind in the temple a people who were committed and devoted to being together my friends they sense listen they sense this opportunity
[time=2396] opportunity to affect their world they want it deeply to honor and obey God and they're desperate for both physical and spiritual survival so they begin together to first of all receive teaching I want you to write this down many of you in the room can answer this question I realize that others of you in the room maybe this would be a good chance for you to begin to learn the answer to this question some may need a reminder why is it so important to receive teaching
[time=2425] why is it so important that the body of Christ why is it so important that a family like this would gather have a devotion an obstinate commitment to being together to receive teaching why is that so important
[time=2439] think about this number one the teaching of God's word brings understanding the teaching of God's word brings understanding and application opportunities application of the scriptures life changing truth the teaching of God's word brings understanding
[time=2457] with reference to the scriptures themselves Paul not only do we learn things about God's design for the church in the book of Acts but we see even in the epistles as the early church began to grow we see amazing things there Paul says to the young pastor Timothy with
[time=2474] reference to the scriptures and the teachings of God he says in in 1 Timothy 4 11 he says prescribe and teach these things here's Timothy responsible for a flock Paul says of the utmost importance to you Timothy as a leader is that you prescribe
[time=2491] and teach these things people from the beginning have needed to hear the words of God people everywhere need to hear his instruction I mean you think about it in your you think about it in your everyday life
[time=2506] I mean how many times in a given week are you confused how many times in a given week are you questioning whether or not you're going to make it through a certain circumstance or situation how many times in your week are you frustrated or hurting over your marriage
[time=2520] how many times in your week are you confused and wondering what you should do in terms of trying to give an investment that counts in the life of your 13 or 17 year old how many times in your week are you frustrated at work and how it is you're supposed to deal
[time=2534] as a believer and follower of Christ with those who are antagonistic toward your faith I mean how many times in a given week do you and I at some point sit back and say oh my goodness
[time=2544] I need some help here I need some encouragement I need some direction God's word God's word pro the teaching of God's word the explaining of God's word the application of God's word
[time=2560] gives support and encouragement it brings the scriptures life changing truth to bear in your life and mind 2 Timothy 3 16 Paul same Paul writing to that same young pastor reminds Timothy that all scripture is inspired by God and it's profitable why do we need to gather and receive the teaching of God's word look because it's profitable spiritually it's profitable for you to be taught it's profitable for teaching
[time=2589] take that first one there it's profitable for teaching teaching there is the communication of sound doctrine it's what that means in that context that teaching word there means the communication of sound doctrine we must gather and as a family we must be taught the truth
[time=2608] about God about God's attributes about sin about salvation about the Holy Spirit about daily Christian like doctrinal truth must be passed along to your heart and mind if we are ever going to stand in the midst of this world that he's placed you and I end with strength and conviction
[time=2629] the word of God when it gets taught it's profitable for teaching for doctrine to be communicated look at the second thing there it's good for reproof it's good for reproof sometimes as the family gathers sometimes you come into this room in sin
[time=2648] sometimes you come into this room and you're sinning you're being unfaithful to your spouse you're being a really really poor example of God's patience and love with your kids and you've blown it and you know it and sometimes you come in this room and you've got a horrible attitude toward an employer and sometimes you and I come in this room and we're thinking thoughts we shouldn't think and our minds are going places they shouldn't go and sometimes it's been going on for days or weeks or months
[time=2677] sometimes when the family gathers and the teaching of God's word goes forth sometimes Hebrews 4 12 it penetrates way down deep into your soul and it reproves you the word of God rebukes you and sometimes you and I need to be what?
[time=2696] rebuked or the word of God is living it says in Hebrews 4 the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword it pierces as far as the division of soul and spirit of both joints and marrow and it is the word of God able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart when the body gathers and the word of God is taught doctrine gets communicated sin gets confronted
[time=2723] look at that third phrase back in 2 Timothy 3 16 for teaching for reproop for reproop for correction the correction where their mouth might sound like rebuked but really it's not the correction where there is just the fact that sometimes as you come and gather
[time=2738] and you receive teaching sometimes you hear things from the scriptures that help adjust maybe it's not an area of sin maybe there's just areas in your life like I know there are areas in mind where when I hear the truth it adjusts me
[time=2752] it sets me on a slightly different course there's correction that's brought it clears up some thinking the word of God has the power to do that and for training it says the fourth thing that happens when you and I gather and you receive teaching
[time=2768] your trained it says what does it say there trained in righteousness the word of God is like a coach the word of God is like a drill sergeant in a sense the word of God is like that trainer that comes alongside you and it speaks into your heart and it speaks into your life and it paints a picture of where you can go and it paints a picture of how you can get there and the word of God it trains you it helps you get stronger
[time=2797] it helps you have better vision it helps you be better at what God's called you to do it trains you like an athlete for that which God has called you to compete in this race of life it's a powerful powerful tool
[time=2815] now you can sit here and say some of you have said to me and I've had the discussion for years you can say I agree with all that and I've got some great CDs in my car and that's how I get my teaching
[time=2829] I got some great books at home and I sit there at my desk and there's all plethora there's thousands of great teachers on the internet and I watch them on TV and I can get my teacher I agree with everything you're saying Kelly I can get that on my own but see here's the deal
[time=2845] the deal is that when you come back here to the book of Acts they were a people who love to be where together when you come back to God's design for Christian living when you come back to the biblical prescription for following Christ my friends
[time=2859] nowhere nowhere do we see that that's some individual gig nowhere do we see that somehow that's going to work when you and I try and do that alone everywhere we see in God's design that this was some while there is great benefit to you and I experiencing solitude with him it is clear that in God's design the family there were times when the family is together
[time=2886] why is it so important for us to receive teaching secondly the teaching of God's word brings vision and direction to the life and ministry of a local church
[time=2896] God I believe that with all my heart God wants to teach us God through the teaching of a local fellowships teaching elders basically is how that works where there are teaching elders God communicates the truth the life changing truth of the scripture
[time=2913] and in doing so brings vision and direction to a local family God wants to teach us in the assembly God wants to give us ongoing clarity for our ministry future God wants his words his voice to penetrate our lives collectively
[time=2932] so from the beginning God's design was for those that led in local congregations to teach and communicate his truth to his people who constantly who constantly gathered to receive it
[time=2951] and I I make that commitment again to you this morning I don't think I'm the greatest I don't think I'm the greatest teacher in the world you can find a lot of guys on the Internet who are a lot better at this than I am a lot
[time=2970] I'm okay with that because I don't think this is necessarily about who's the greatest teacher I just want you to know that on our part here in this family we're going to keep doing our best to have men stand here qualified
[time=2984] men stand here and do their very best to teach you what the word of God says to communicate that to explain that to give you opportunities to apply that and I think it's on you just like it's on me when I'm in settings where I'm sitting where you're sitting I can sit there and think gosh I don't really connect
[time=3004] with this guy I can sit where you sit and listen to guys and say huh I'm not sure I'm getting anything out of this it's consumerism it doesn't immediately jive with me so I put the coat back on the rack and I want to move on well sometimes when I'm sitting in settings like you sit in this morning
[time=3025] I realize I might have to roll up my sleeves here a little bit because I might not connect I may have to work at this to get something out of this that God might have for me and I think that's good for you and I think that's good for me
[time=3038] we're going to do our best to keep teaching this as best we can and I think we want to get better and better and better at it but I want to invite you to be a family that receives it
[time=3048] I want to invite us to be a family that gathers to receive the teaching to hear God's voice again and again and again they gathered my friends and not just to receive teaching they gathered as well right this down they gathered to be together
[time=3064] that might just sound obvious to you but we've talked about this in the past and I'm not going to belabor the point this morning but I want to just remind you there was something there was something about their world there was something about following Christ in their day
[time=3077] being together meant something I found a great quote this week let me just read it to you when as a family or community you face death or extreme trial when as a family or community you face death
[time=3093] or extreme trial the one thing that brings hope and strength the one thing that can oftentimes renew courage and calm the troubled soul is simply seeing those you love being in proximity to those you share your life pursuit with touching them hearing their voices being together
[time=3121] my minds have been on the as they should be and our hearts have been with those in China recently I think the last report I read said that that quake was somewhere in the seven point seven seven point eight magnitude
[time=3136] and while I've told you the story before and I'm not going to not going to get into the whole story again this morning you know I can't ever hear a story like that and not go back to January 1994
[time=3148] twenty six in the morning in our little condo in LA we were awoken by a seven point two magnitude quake and it's a long story as to you know what it was like and I can tell you about it if you ever want to know the particulars but here's my point
[time=3163] this morning my point this morning is this when that thing after forty seven seconds stopped forty seven seconds that felt like three hours when that thing stopped and when I was finally able to in the dark find my wife
[time=3177] and my eighteen month old son in a condo that had been absolutely torn apart we carefully gingerly in the midst of now immediate aftershocks we got a few blankets
[time=3188] we got some shoes on and we walked out the door and down the steps of our condo there's sirens going off there's people screaming there's fires that have started I mean it's like a scene from a movie and all of a sudden you realize you're in it
[time=3201] and we're walking down the steps I'm terrified and I want you to know what I didn't say anything to Deborah she didn't say anything to me we just began to walk toward the middle of the complex because we knew in our hearts it's like we just knew that in the middle of the complex
[time=3218] hopefully we would find the Kennedys and the stewards and the millers three friends of ours young couples all of us in the same small group all of us apart of the same church they all lived in that same complex
[time=3234] and it was just like a it was like a magnet I mean because no kidding no sooner had we gotten in the dark now it's like five in the sun starting to crack and you can kind of start to see we make our way into this grass area in the middle of this complex and sure enough
[time=3250] there's three other couples with blankets and everybody's just kind of walking toward the middle all of a sudden we see each other and the walk turns into a sprint and I got a kid in my arm and my wife and before you know we're in the middle of this grass
[time=3263] little area just hugging each other and just crying and and touching and hugging and are you okay and how did how did you get through you know just boom right there real tight and we're disheveled and we're weeping and we're scared
[time=3279] and we're together and the and the point is I think too many times maybe this doesn't mean much to you and I maybe too many times we don't come see we don't come through these doors
[time=3292] disheveled weeping scared so many times the week that you've had in the week that I've had so many times your spiritual existence and mine see the scriptures
[time=3305] normative normative Christian living in the scriptures is it's a battle it's a fight it's a war it's an earthquake it's a it's tumultuous but see too many times my everyday Christian living isn't that
[time=3321] and so there isn't this desperate sense in me that I've got to get to the center of the complex to find my friends and be together because I'm I'm all right
[time=3331] and I don't think you and I can manufacture this but what I do believe with all of my heart they gathered to be together and there was something about being together that was very related to the way they were living in the culture they were in and the way they were living was obedient
[time=3349] it was faithful it was gutsy had integrity read in Acts 5 we're not going to turn there now Acts 5 John and Peter they preach the name of Christ the authorities call them in and say shut up
[time=3362] do not preach the name of Christ they let him go they go back out to the temple courts they gather the people come they preach the name of Christ they haul them in
[time=3371] they said we told you not to we told you not to preach the name of Christ they bring all the apostles in look at verse 40 of Acts 5 real quick I'll just throw it up there
[time=3384] Acts 5 verse 40 they took his advice and after calling the apostles in they flogged them okay this is the culture they lived in they obeyed God and they got flogged
[time=3396] anybody seen the passion of the Christ did you see what happened raise your hand if you've seen the passion of the Christ what happened to Jesus there that was a flogging they get flogged 39 lashes one short of death
[time=3410] and then look what it says they flogged him and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and then release them and it says in 41 so they went out on their way from the presence of the council rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for his name and look where they went
[time=3425] look where they went look where they went and every day in the temple and from house to house they kept right on what teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ sometimes when you and I are willing to obey that much sometimes when we're willing to be spiritually
[time=3444] personally extended that far sometimes when we really give ourselves that really give ourselves to what God's called us to sometimes that gets tough I doubt you'll get flogged for it but I tell you what there are weeks when I've been in that fight
[time=3461] there are weeks when I've been in that battle and it is it is a Sunday morning when I'm really those are the weeks when on Sunday morning I'm really really thankful to see you I hope there would be a willingness in you
[time=3473] a willingness in you to come and be together I hope you'll in the days to come with me make a commitment to gathering to receive teaching and we're going to look at that third point next week
[time=3503] we're going to take a look at that third point we're going to take a look at that third point we're going to take a look at that third point we're going to take a look at that third point we're going to take a look at that third point we're going to take a look at that third point.
