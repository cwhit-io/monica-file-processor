[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=8] And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
[time=15] [MUSIC]
[time=20] Therefore go and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=28] [MUSIC]
[time=36] Teaching them to observe all I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=43] [MUSIC]
[time=47] Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=50] [MUSIC]
[time=59] And the choir and the band have prepared a song for us to sing, or to listen to, excuse me, and participate in worship.
[time=66] Please listen to the words that they're saying today.
[time=68] They're going to challenge each of you to use your voices to sing praise to our God.
[time=74] All over the scriptures, the word commands us to sing.
[time=77] And it might not be your forte, but nevertheless it's still commanded.
[time=81] And we're supposed to lift our voices and praise to our God.
[time=84] So listen as they sing and encourage you to do the same.
[time=91] [MUSIC]
[time=110] Now is the time for all people from every band to come together.
[time=120] Now is the moment for worship.
[time=124] We enter in, because he's worthy, he's exulting, he's high, he's high, and he's fasting.
[time=140] Sing it to the Lord, open up your heart.
[time=145] Hangers are for the Lord, the sanctuary to sing.
[time=151] Come on, ask you with love at the praise of spring, the sanctuary to sing.
[time=161] Come on and sing to the Lord.
[time=166] Now is the time for all people in every land.
[time=174] Come together, now is the moment for worship.
[time=182] We enter in, and for me, not for all people.
[time=187] He's worthy, he's exulting, he's high, he's fasting, he's fasting.
[time=200] Sing it to the Lord, open up your heart.
[time=205] Haters are for the Lord, the sanctuary to sing.
[time=210] Sing it to the Lord, back to shin with love at the praise of spring, the sanctuary to sing.
[time=219] Sing it to the Lord, open up your heart.
[time=224] Make a circle, Lord, the sanctuary to sing.
[time=230] Sing it to the Lord, back to shin with love at the praise of spring, the sanctuary to sing.
[time=242] Come on and sing, praise his name.
[time=252] Now to open up your mouth and give him praise.
[time=258] Open up your heart, give him praise.
[time=293] Sing, sing, sing.
[time=295] Open up your mouth, give him praise.
[time=908] We just want to continue in worship today by letting you guys experience and see something that might happen on Sunday mornings at our kids' church.
[time=915] And I think as we become adults, sometimes we forget about the great truths that are in those stories that we learned about as children.
[time=924] And so I want to experience that with you guys today.
[time=927] So I have my actors back here.
[time=929] First we have our three disciples.
[time=931] The three that were there earlier.
[time=933] One out.
[time=934] Great job.
[time=935] Let me give our disciples a round of applause.
[time=938] (applause) Yes.
[time=941] Next we have our Sea of Galilee.
[time=945] So if you guys want to come down.
[time=947] There you go.
[time=951] I want to give that a little practice.
[time=955] (applause) That's hard being water.
[time=959] Well done.
[time=961] Now in kids' church, it is participation by everyone.
[time=966] And so you out there sitting down are the sound effects.
[time=969] So I'm going to be watching to make sure everyone is doing it because I will do solo sound effects if I have to.
[time=975] So the first one is this.
[time=978] This is the mist of rain.
[time=980] Everybody practice that?
[time=982] Nice.
[time=983] Next is the raindrops.
[time=985] (applause) Then we have thunderstorm.
[time=990] Thunderstorm.
[time=992] There you go.
[time=994] And the thunder.
[time=996] Boo-boo!
[time=997] Boo!
[time=998] Well done.
[time=999] All right.
[time=1000] Let's get our story started.
[time=1003] Jesus had just finished teaching a crowd of thousands.
[time=1007] He stood in a bow all day to teach because the crowd so intent on hearing what he had to say had pushed themselves all the way to the water's edge.
[time=1016] So when he's finished, he turns to his disciples and he asks them to take him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
[time=1022] Now the disciples, many of whom were fishermen before they decided to follow Jesus, would have been expert sailors.
[time=1029] So they would have known how to get him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee easily.
[time=1033] So Jesus walks to the back of the bow.
[time=1036] The Bible says he lies down on a cushion and he falls fast asleep.
[time=1039] All the while, the disciples start rowing him to the other side.
[time=1042] There you go.
[time=1045] Now if you're real faster, you might get there a little quicker.
[time=1049] Like together?
[time=1051] There you go.
[time=1052] Okay.
[time=1053] It's a long way to go.
[time=1054] All right.
[time=1055] So the disciples are rowing Jesus to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
[time=1058] Now imagine how easily it would have been for him to fall asleep.
[time=1062] The bow is gently rocking.
[time=1064] The water is lapping at the water's at the boat's edge.
[time=1067] I would have fallen fast asleep myself.
[time=1069] So Jesus is sleeping and they're rowing.
[time=1072] Together, a little faster.
[time=1074] There we go.
[time=1076] Now the disciples look up in the sky and they see some great clouds.
[time=1080] And they exchange bird glances.
[time=1084] All right.
[time=1086] And freeze.
[time=1087] Now to give you guys a little DVD extra.
[time=1090] The Sea of Galilee is located in a gorge between two mountain ranges.
[time=1094] And they say the wind comes down through the gorge and monster storms explode.
[time=1099] And they say that 10, 20, and 30 foot waves happen during these storms.
[time=1104] So these are monster scary, perfect storm waves.
[time=1108] And the disciples know what that's like.
[time=1110] So they're scared.
[time=1112] Back to our story.
[time=1113] The disciples start paddling even faster because they want to get out of there before the storm starts.
[time=1119] But it does start.
[time=1120] And they hear it.
[time=1121] The mist.
[time=1122] Yeah.
[time=1123] But it's only a mist.
[time=1125] And they look around and relieve that it's only the mist.
[time=1127] But before they can even finish that thought, they hear it.
[time=1130] The clean, clear, crisp, sound of raindrops falling one after another.
[time=1137] The sky grows dark as the black waves pound up against the sight of the boat.
[time=1141] And it hits the disciples coming over the side.
[time=1145] And they are terrified of what is happening.
[time=1148] Boom, boom.
[time=1150] The sky echoes as it lets forth this flood gate of rain.
[time=1154] Boom, boom.
[time=1156] The water is coming over the edge and it's making the boat sick.
[time=1161] Where is Jesus?
[time=1162] Jesus is asleep.
[time=1163] How can Jesus be asleep?
[time=1165] Boom, boom.
[time=1166] The boat is sinking.
[time=1168] They have to wake Jesus.
[time=1169] So the disciples go and they scream, "Teacher, do you want us to die?" Boom, boom.
[time=1175] Jesus opens his eyes.
[time=1177] He looks at the disciples.
[time=1179] He walks to the side of the boat.
[time=1181] Boom, boom.
[time=1182] The thunder echoes and Jesus looks at the storm and he says, "Peace!" Be still.
[time=1212] Peace like a river, a tent with my way.
[time=1223] When sorrows, like sea bellows, rose.
[time=1236] Whatever my love thou hast taught me to say.
[time=1248] It is well.
[time=1251] It is well with my soul.
[time=1270] With my soul.
[time=1273] It is well.
[time=1276] It is well with my soul.
[time=1291] I sing all the bliss of his glory as thought.
[time=1306] I sing not in part, but the whole.
[time=1319] It is well to the cross and I live with no more.
[time=1330] Praise the Lord.
[time=1339] My soul.
[time=1344] It is well with my soul.
[time=1374] And the Lord hast a day.
[time=1381] With my faith shall be sound.
[time=1388] The clouds be rolled back as a storm.
[time=1401] The storm shall be sound.
[time=1407] And the Lord shall descend.
[time=1413] Even soul gives well with my soul.
[time=1426] It is well with my soul.
[time=1436] With my soul.
[time=1439] It is well.
[time=1443] It is well with my soul.
[time=1476] Thanks for that good morning, Corbin.
[time=1484] I have been worshipping on Sunday mornings at state and lay mire for 29 years.
[time=1492] And I have never had a bad morning.
[time=1502] Every worship leader, there have been several.
[time=1507] Every pastor.
[time=1512] Every Sunday school teacher.
[time=1516] Their motives have been good.
[time=1522] Paul and Sharon, I haven't seen you for a long time.
[time=1529] And I'm just really grateful for that.
[time=1534] And this morning, we're going to look at a passage of scripture
[time=1540] that makes it possible for us to enjoy the unity of the Spirit.
[time=1547] Not the unity of Blackhawk.
[time=1551] I was enjoying all those worship times because the men and women were so good.
[time=1557] Because the Spirit of God has been good.
[time=1562] In different forms and different ways, I've been able to worship every time.
[time=1583] I used to teach econ and I taught economics to high school seniors.
[time=1591] Sometimes at the beginning of the semester, I'd say something like, let's think today about what life you'd like to live.
[time=1601] Let's define together what you'd like life to be like for you in the future.
[time=1609] And we'd talk about things like whether they were going to be married or single.
[time=1614] Have kids not have kids.
[time=1616] Where they might want to live.
[time=1619] At the beginning of the period, when we first started the discussion, students would often think about these exotic places that they might like to live.
[time=1627] Outside the country, maybe even inside the country.
[time=1630] What kind of house it might be big and grandiose.
[time=1633] But eventually, we'd start talking about what was best.
[time=1638] What's the best way to live?
[time=1641] If you're going to have a family, what would be the best place that you know of to raise up a family?
[time=1648] What would be the best amount of money that you might make that might make it okay to be able to do the things you want to do,
[time=1656] but not kind of be a noose around your neck in some ways?
[time=1659] What would be the best way to do that?
[time=1661] So we'd talk about where and what kind of family and what kind of house, what kind of things, how much money, and what would be best.
[time=1671] Often, they started with these grandiose ideas and this scope that was really, really wide.
[time=1677] But often, when they really got serious about that, even high school seniors would narrow their focus and talk about things that were really important.
[time=1688] Well, this morning, we get to look at a passage of Scripture that describes for us how to live a life worthy of his calling.
[time=1707] And it's not where, what, or how big. It's about our character and our conduct.
[time=1715] And it describes for us the kind of character we should have and the way we should treat one another in order to enjoy life and be the kind of person in the body of Christ that God wants us to be.
[time=1730] And before we read the passage that I'm actually going to teach, I just want you to listen, because in Ephesians 1 through 3, Paul sets the stage for this passage that we're going to look at in Ephesians 4.
[time=1741] And Ephesians 1 through 3 describes that I was a chosen person by a sovereign God, that we who are part of the body of Christ have been chosen by Him, and we can enjoy that.
[time=1752] He talks about unity in Christ. He talks to us about the fact that some of us are Gentiles and we were chosen and grafted into this royal family that he'd already chosen the Jewish nation.
[time=1767] He describes what Christ's done for us. And at the end of chapter 3, he prays this, and I just want to read it to just listen, don't turn there.
[time=1780] Don't read, just listen to this. He says, "For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name."
[time=1792] I pray that out of his glorious riches, he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[time=1804] And I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power together with all the saints to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.
[time=1816] And to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
[time=1828] Now to him who is able to do a measurably more than all we ask or imagine.
[time=1839] According to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever, amen.
[time=1854] And he kind of concludes that part of the book of Ephesians and he says, "Amen, let's give him glory forever and ever. He deserves it. He deserves our attention."
[time=1866] And then he says this, "Please stand and we'll read Ephesians 4."
[time=1874] And Paul says, "As a prisoner of the Lord then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
[time=1884] Be completely humble and gentle. Be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace.
[time=1894] There is one body and one spirit just as you were called to one hope when you were called, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
[time=1907] Our Father in Heaven, I pray that what you have in store for us this morning from Ephesians 4 would just encourage and change us both.
[time=1923] I pray that we would be a people who could live life in such a way that others would say that's a life worthy of the calling that they've received.
[time=1941] I pray that we would reflect you not us in our lives and that people would see you in us as we love each other.
[time=1951] Please help us to learn that today. In Christ's name I pray. Amen. Have a seat.
[time=1961] Well, a life worthy of our calling isn't about what or where or how much. A life worthy of our calling is who we are in Christ.
[time=1977] It's our character and what gets lived out in our conduct that reflects that very character. And so he describes for us, Paul describes for us the character that would express the kind of conduct that would have people saying, well, that's a life worthy of the calling.
[time=2002] That's a called out one there. That's one who's received something from someplace else. It's not just them doing it.
[time=2012] A life worthy of our calling. Paul at that first verse he says, he says, "I urge you," in verse one.
[time=2020] The NAS says, implore. I like that word too. Urge, implore. It means to beg, to entreat. But what I like best about it is that word really can mean in verse one of chapter four.
[time=2031] He says, "I urge you, I implore you." It can mean, come alongside me while I do this. Or I'll come alongside you while we do this.
[time=2043] "I urge you," he says, "I implore you. I beg you. I entreat you. Let me come alongside you. You come alongside me and we'll live this worthy life out together."
[time=2058] Worthy is another really interesting word. The word really has this meaning of balance in it. It's about this life I have being balanced with this calling that I have.
[time=2076] The calling and the conduct are in harmony and they're balanced. And so he says to us here, there's a life that you can live that's worthy of the calling and it'll express itself in ways that make that calling appear to be balanced with it.
[time=2097] It's equal to, it's worthy of the calling. And I was asking myself, is my conduct equal to my calling? This week, that's a, don't ponder that too long, it's not fun.
[time=2124] He begs us. Then in verse two, he says, well, this is how to do it. Here are the components of a called out lifestyle.
[time=2135] And he says, be completely humble. Be humble is hard enough. I can't believe he said be completely humble like that.
[time=2144] There's a sense in which this means just totally be immersed in humility, be a complete, it's a deep sense of one's littleness.
[time=2160] It's a really good word. It really does mean that. It means I have an understanding about how little I am.
[time=2171] I love to look at the sky where we live. Sometimes at night out there in Zulu, it is really dark.
[time=2181] And if it's not cloudy, the stars are just incredible out there. And I look at how vast that is and I like to read about it.
[time=2190] When I think about how big it is, and this intelligent designer, he created it all and I just get so small when I look at that.
[time=2206] I get so little. And it's really good for me. I read the leadership secrets of Billy Graham last year of the year before.
[time=2219] And there was a section in there that really struck me. It was a section about the team that he was gathering together.
[time=2227] And Cliff Barrows was the guy that led music and was really the MC of Billy Graham's Crusades, an incredible guy.
[time=2234] And I didn't know this about him, but in the 40s, Cliff Barrows and his wife Billy were amazing and amazing evangelistic team themselves.
[time=2244] And God was really using them. And he could sing and lead and she could play the piano and she sang, they sang duets, they sang solos.
[time=2254] They were incredible. And God was using them like crazy. And Billy Graham was having a crusade someplace just getting started.
[time=2261] And at the last minute, their worship leader got called away or sick or something and they had to ask somebody to help them.
[time=2267] On the spur of the moment, they asked Cliff Barrows and he did it. And he did it really well. And then they asked him to go to England with them for six months and he did that.
[time=2275] And he served there with Billy Graham and they had a lot of trials there in England. Things weren't going so well with the Billy Graham team in those days.
[time=2281] They came back home. Cliff Barrows and his wife Billy started to do their thing again and were really having a lot of success.
[time=2288] And Billy Graham called him up and said, "Cliff, I'd like for you to come and join our team." And he didn't say it this way, but in reality, this is what it was, and served me.
[time=2301] And Cliff Barrows made some comments and even wrote in this book, there were some comments about the fact that he had this thriving ministry.
[time=2309] I mean, he was exploding. God was really using him. He probably had a lot more talent than Billy Graham had. Billy Graham would say that today. A whole lot more talent.
[time=2322] He said he and his wife, it was kind of surprised, but they went away and they said they'd pray about that.
[time=2328] So Cliff Barrows and Billy Barrows prayed. And he said he just couldn't get it off his mind.
[time=2335] He said, "I really didn't want to do it, but I just couldn't get it off my mind." And he said, "Finally, we both just agreed. Lord, if that's what you want us to do, we're in."
[time=2345] And so he called Billy Graham and he said, "If you want me to carry your bags, I'll do it."
[time=2354] Little. He knew how little he was. And he didn't go to Billy Graham to decide. He went to the calling one.
[time=2370] And he chose with his wife, Billy, they served with Billy Graham all these years. Sometimes you have to get little.
[time=2383] And you have to know you're little. So are you completely humble? Is there a deep sense of littleness in your life?
[time=2394] Second thing he says there is he says, "Be completely humble and gentle." And I was thinking about gentle and I thought about Keith Moore.
[time=2405] As soon as I started thinking about gentle people, I thought about Pastor Keith. Every time I've ever been with him, there's been a gentleness about him that's attractive to me.
[time=2416] He's so gentle and soft. That word "gentle" is used in Galatians 6, you know, when it says, "If someone's caught in a sin, gently restore them."
[time=2430] We don't go beat people over the head with their sin. We go in gentleness. God wants us to be gentle people.
[time=2439] It's the opposite of self-assertion. It's the opposite of harshness. It's the opposite of rudeness. I can be like that. I relate to the opposites of gentle.
[time=2453] I want to be more gentle. I want to be more like Keith. I believe he's been more like Christ.
[time=2465] Then he says, "To be patient." Oh, you want to live a life worthy of your calling? Be completely humble, be gentle, and be patient.
[time=2478] Patient means enduring, steadfast, constant, persevering. Some of you are naturally more gifted at that than some of the rest of us. I'm not so good at that.
[time=2489] But I got to watch it a lot because my dad had a nature that was pretty laid back, and then he made choices to practice patience a lot.
[time=2499] I remember we used to go fishing in. Typically, dad would choose crappie fishing with a bobber, and we just drift across the lake and kind of hope we bumped into a school of crappies or a walleye once in a while, because they might hit that minnow.
[time=2515] But every once in a while, he'd let me go bass fishing, and we'd go bass fishing.
[time=2521] And when you go bass fishing, instead of just drifting with a bobber, you cast and retrieve, and you cast and retrieve.
[time=2531] In those days, in the 50s and 60s, the casting reels weren't so good. The casting reels were meant -- you had to be good at it. The equipment couldn't make you good.
[time=2544] When you cast, if the lure hit the water before your thumb hit the line to stop it, the line kept going and it got in this tangled up mess.
[time=2555] And it was incredible. It was called a backlash, because sometimes the line would get wrapped around it and just snap it back like that, and it would just create this incredible mess in a reel.
[time=2565] Anybody ever had that happen to them before? Yeah. Most of the men.
[time=2571] My dad would hand me his rod, take my backlash. Now, get this. I wasn't the backlash.
[time=2586] He might even be a little bit frustrated at the backlash, but he wasn't frustrated at me. I wasn't the backlash.
[time=2592] And he'd sit there and he'd take that thing, and I think just to practice patience in front of me, my dad would sit in a boat or on the bank, and he would sit there and mess with that mess until it was fixed.
[time=2607] And I'd say, "Let's cut it off and put some new line on, Dad." No way.
[time=2613] Sometimes he'd even have to get a little needle or a pen kind of pick at that stuff. Good grief.
[time=2619] So patient. But he's the same guy that told me, too, we slept in an upstairs.
[time=2624] The attic had been converted into a bedroom for my brother and me, and it was hot in there.
[time=2629] We had an enclosed stairway. There was one window in our room, and it was just hot, and the summertime was really hot.
[time=2634] I'd come down often and say, "Dad, would you just let me sleep on the floor in the living room tonight?" And this is what Dad would say all the time. "Son, lie still."
[time=2650] It's 108 up there, Dad. Lie still. And my dad would do it.
[time=2657] My dad practiced patience, and he tried to teach me to be a patient man. It's not my nature.
[time=2666] God wants us to be patient. He wants us to endure and be steadfast.
[time=2673] He wants us to be constant and persevering with the backlashes, and don't treat the people like they're the backlashes.
[time=2685] Sometimes I'm a tangled up mess, and I create backlashes for your life.
[time=2692] God wants you to be tolerant with me. He wants you to show tolerance in patience with me, and I need to do the same with you.
[time=2702] That takes us to the next word that tolerance, because the NAS says showing tolerance instead of bearing with.
[time=2710] Look at that. Be patient. Bearing with one another in love, the NIV says.
[time=2715] The NAS says showing tolerance. Tolerance, that doesn't mean put up with it. That's not what it's about.
[time=2721] It's not me just, "Okay, I'll be a spouse, and I'll put up with my spouse again.
[time=2727] I'll be a friend and put up with you again, you backlasher."
[time=2733] No. You know what it means? That tolerance word in the NAS, that bear with word means to hold up.
[time=2743] It means you've created a mess. I'm going to hold you up, and I'm going to go with you through this as we bear with one another.
[time=2756] I've been learning a lot about what it means to be a burden bearer over the years. I call people periodically, and I like to wait a little while.
[time=2766] Maybe a month after somebody's experienced something, maybe they've been bombarded a lot, but if you call somebody and you say, "I just want you to know, I've been begging God to give me some of your burden."
[time=2780] And I want you to know he's been doing it. I've been feeling your burden.
[time=2787] There's a lot of relief. Sometimes we know that's happening because our burden's not as big as it should be.
[time=2793] You ever been there? You move through some kind of drown, you say, "Good grief ought to be feeling worse than this."
[time=2799] I believe my burden bearers have been bearing my burden.
[time=2804] So he wants us to bear with one another in love, the kind of love that says, "I'm not just putting up with you. I'm holding you up."
[time=2821] I've observed that too. I haven't been that so much all the time, but I've observed it.
[time=2829] This week I just learned a fresh one, so I need to tell you because it's good for me to remember this.
[time=2834] I told Nancy when I got home, I went away with a friend to a counseling intensive, and one of the things I learned about myself was this.
[time=2843] For one thing, I learned this. A lot of our behaviors come out of these four quadrants, and psychologists have, I've read this stuff before, and it's different words with different people, but it's basically this.
[time=2854] There's a quadrant in which people have fear, and their behavior comes out of that, and sometimes there's an anger quadrant that their behavior comes out, and sometimes they're just in despair, and their behavior comes out of that.
[time=2866] And then the other one's just called foolishness. Well, I told him, man, I wouldn't mind fear, anger, and despair, because that's kind of, you feel like justified, but just a fool?
[time=2876] But that's where I was. I'm in the fool quadrant.
[time=2880] That's where I've been, and I know that's true, and when I thought about how I've been foolish, I don't really live in anger.
[time=2888] I'm not a person that's fearful. I haven't been saddened down and in despair, but if I've been foolish, and one of the ways that I've been incredibly foolish, it's been a real teary week thinking about this, so bear with me.
[time=2907] And it'll seem small to some of you.
[time=2910] But for years, I have been justifying my foolish financial irresponsibility, my foolish financial behavior, and saying I was trusting God.
[time=2931] I've had two wives. They both needed a little bit of financial security, not something unreasonable. I'm talking about a little bit, a little bit of money over here that's available if something breaks.
[time=2945] I've never been there. I've given it away, spent on vacations, whatever. Financially irresponsible fool.
[time=2957] I've been better lately. Nancy and I have been working. I've been better lately. The last couple years, I've been better, but good grief. I'm 57 years old.
[time=2970] They have been bearing up with me. Nancy has never, you fool. Renee never did it. I bet they had a lot of times where they thought it, but they never did that to me.
[time=2985] They bore up under this foolishness of mine that was very justifiable. And I'm sorry, but I'm thankful.
[time=3000] I've seen that. I've seen that love. That's at home, down dirty kind of stuff. That's what you don't see on Sundays with people.
[time=3009] That's me being irresponsible and them bearing me up and loving me through that and yielding to me who was supposed to be the servant leader in that relationship using my power to give money away what I shouldn't have given away for my sake.
[time=3028] I've seen tolerance. Then it says in verse 3, "Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
[time=3039] Make every effort. Exert yourself. Work at this to keep the bond of peace." We haven't been experiencing a lot of unity around here lately.
[time=3049] I don't think we're working so hard at it.
[time=3057] The unity that in the bond of peace exert yourself, he says, "Make every effort." Then look at what it says.
[time=3065] It says, "Make every effort to keep not make the unity of the Spirit." It's not something I define to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
[time=3076] The unity of the Spirit of God should be reigning here.
[time=3084] Have you been exerting yourself to keep his unity?
[time=3094] Peace, that's an interesting word. Listen to this.
[time=3097] I had to look through a lot of definitions to find the one I wanted, but this is it.
[time=3102] It's not the absence of strife. It's not the absence of war.
[time=3108] Peace is the tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ, fearing nothing from God.
[time=3119] Content with its earthly lot, whatever that is.
[time=3129] Some of you, you've had a lot that hasn't been so easy.
[time=3133] Your lot in life has been pretty hard, but you can have peace in it.
[time=3139] Exerting yourself to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[time=3145] Are you bound to that kind of peace?
[time=3151] I'm going to read it again. Listen closely. The tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ, fearing nothing from God.
[time=3161] I'm at peace with God.
[time=3164] Content with its earthly lot, whatever that is.
[time=3170] I want that kind of peace.
[time=3173] Then the components of this unity that he's talking about, he follows and he goes, "There's one body, one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
[time=3191] We're the channel through which he expresses his unity.
[time=3203] Have you been experiencing life worthy of your calling?
[time=3214] Has Blackhawk been experiencing the life worthy of his calling?
[time=3228] Are we experiencing the unity that we should be?
[time=3232] Well, to the extent that each of us are exerting ourselves to be a person living a life worthy of the calling, we'll be experiencing that collectively.
[time=3245] There's power in that.
[time=3249] Are you humble?
[time=3251] Are you gentle?
[time=3254] Are you patient?
[time=3256] Are you bearing with one another in love?
[time=3260] Are you keeping the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace?
[time=3264] If we do, life, real life.
[time=3277] I know two people live like that.
[time=3280] Demi and Marta came to Fort Wayne from Ethiopia a long time ago.
[time=3285] They started something called Project Mercy here in town.
[time=3288] Demi was a very successful businessman in Ethiopia, exported coffee and a lot of other things.
[time=3294] He's a creative guy.
[time=3296] They're in their 70s now.
[time=3298] Marta was a Senator over there in Ethiopia.
[time=3302] When the Communists took over, the Communists were going to kill Demi and Marta and their family.
[time=3307] Hylie Selassie, remember that name some of you that are old enough to do?
[time=3310] When they kicked him out and their lives were threatened so they got in a car
[time=3317] and they fled Adisababa and they went off into the desert in Sudan and they just about died.
[time=3323] Their kids really were near death.
[time=3325] They drank the water out of their radiator.
[time=3327] Stay alive.
[time=3329] When they came over here, they had nothing.
[time=3331] And they ended up in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3334] And they started again.
[time=3338] And Demi started business and he made money again.
[time=3341] He gave the money to her to give the money to Ethiopia.
[time=3344] And they did all kinds of things.
[time=3346] They've done so much you can't believe everything they've done.
[time=3348] But they decided to build a school and a hospital and a place for some orphans down in Yettabon,
[time=3354] which is a long way from Adisababa on their roads with lots of donkeys.
[time=3361] And they're there living the life worthy of their calling.
[time=3374] And now they could be here living a different kind of life.
[time=3383] There's 75.
[time=3384] I asked him.
[time=3386] I said, "When are you guys going to think about slowing down?" And I think Marta's answer was we're going to think about going part time at 95.
[time=3394] Is that what she said?
[time=3396] 95 years old.
[time=3397] Her dad was 100 and something.
[time=3399] He was old.
[time=3401] "I've watched them.
[time=3404] Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control just come flowing out of them."
[time=3411] Because they are just attached to the life-giver who's called them to that life.
[time=3418] I don't think he's called you to Ethiopia, but he's called you to this life in Ephesians 4 verses 1 through 6.
[time=3428] God help us, please help us.
[time=3433] We want to experience the kind of unity that you have expressed to us in your word here.
[time=3440] We want your spirit to control what we do here.
[time=3445] And I pray that, Lord, we will honor you by trusting you and taking these steps to live a life worthy of the calling.
[time=3457] We received in Christ Jesus.
[time=3459] In His name I pray, amen.
