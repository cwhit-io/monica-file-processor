[time=714] About your heads with me, would you, on behalf of all of us in the room?
[time=726] So many of us here this morning who do know him.
[time=730] And you like me are amazed, grateful, and so appreciative of all the great truth.
[time=738] We've just been able to sing about, oh God, we stand before you.
[time=742] And we proclaim to you as a family today with hearts overflowing with gratitude and amazement.
[time=750] Holy, holy, holy is our Lord God Almighty.
[time=756] God you are bigger, God you are stronger, God you are wiser.
[time=761] God your kingdom is this amazing thing that you keep moving forward and as you do you extend
[time=769] compassion and your justice and your kindness and your truth and you let people like us
[time=776] be a part of that great endeavor and Father we are grateful.
[time=780] We bring our tithes and our offerings this morning.
[time=784] God we bring these sacrificial gifts.
[time=787] We've given and God we've brought these gifts and we know that in bringing them and offering
[time=793] them to you that we're to do so your word says graciously we're to do so with great energy
[time=800] it's to thrill us to come and bring these sacrifices to you.
[time=806] And so we do God and we know that it's an honor and we're grateful for what you've provided
[time=813] and here we give a portion of it back God and can't wait to see what you'll do with it and now we'll get to help inside and outside these four walls and the days to come.
[time=823] We love you Lord grateful for this time of worship and your son's name we pray and all the people agreed and said amen you can be seated.
[time=833] Hey I want to ask Jeff and Sarah if they would come on up.
[time=838] Jeff Harless and Sarah Rogers, friends of mine, friends of ours a part of this family and they
[time=844] were with me over in Nairobi Kenya.
[time=848] Jeff is part of our global ministries team.
[time=851] In fact Jeff really gives oversight to our short-term trips and Sarah is one who is really called
[time=858] to missions to global ministry though she has a nine to five.
[time=863] She saves up and looks for every opportunity God gives her to go and to pass along his
[time=869] love and his truth and his compassion and lately she's been doing a lot of that passing along over in Africa and we were so blessed to have her as part of our team.
[time=878] I've asked them the two of them if they would just take just a minute or two and share with you some of the things that God taught them some of the things that they were able to be a part of there during our stay at the orphanage and getting to do all that we got to do there in Nairobi and I know you'll be encouraged as you continue to hear about what God did
[time=898] in us and through us during our time there. Sarah why don't you go first.
[time=903] Good morning everybody. First of all I want to thank God and give him all the glory honor
[time=909] and praise for this trip. It was successful because he worked through us.
[time=913] He kept us safe not only going there but coming back and through our travel through Kenya.
[time=921] Second of all I'd like to thank those of you who gave and supported us financially.
[time=927] Those who were our prayer warriors not only for us as we traveled but for our families
[time=933] that stayed behind. So thank you to all of you.
[time=938] This past year I've been studying Matthew and Matthew 25 has always been very special
[time=944] to me since God's call in my life to mission work in 1995. I'd like to read it to you.
[time=950] This is Jesus's response to the crowd who was asking him when did we do these things
[time=957] and it reads for I was hungry and you gave me food.
[time=961] I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
[time=966] I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me.
[time=970] I was in prison and you came to me.
[time=973] Truly I say to you as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me.
[time=979] Even though we do a lot of this here in Fort Wayne in our neighborhoods and in our families
[time=986] God showed me over in Kenya that this is what we were doing over there.
[time=992] And this is for many of you too who gave suitcases full of baby clothes that we took
[time=999] over that they were so thrilled to receive.
[time=1002] So you too not only financially supported us and prayed for us but you gave clothing
[time=1008] to feed these babies or to clothe these babies.
[time=1012] We went over and we fed them. We had three sets.
[time=1017] We had babies crawlers and toddlers.
[time=1020] The babies we did feed baby bottles to the rest.
[time=1023] We helped with sippy cups with feeding them.
[time=1027] We encouraged the workers by mopping floors, washing shoes,
[time=1033] drying shoes, making cotton balls.
[time=1037] So we were there encouraging the workers not only taking care of babies.
[time=1042] When I look at this it says I was a stranger.
[time=1045] There were three of us walking back from the orphanage to the guest house and we had an old gentleman following us.
[time=1052] I don't know whether he was homeless or from Kibera begging for money.
[time=1056] And Hannah turned around and said we can't give you money but we'll give you food.
[time=1061] And he was thrilled. We went in and because we had taken snack foods and breakfast bars over we were able to package up a sack full of food for him.
[time=1072] So we were feeding strangers. We were welcoming him.
[time=1076] Four days later when we were getting ready to come back he showed up again.
[time=1082] He had 12 children and that's why he was back again.
[time=1086] And we ended up, Todd and I packaged up all our food that we were bringing back
[time=1092] home and sent on with him.
[time=1095] Of course my prayer the following week was I prayed that there would be somebody there to feed him again because they don't eat but maybe one meal every three to four days.
[time=1106] I was looking at this and thinking well I've communicated with a person in prison but I've not been there. I can really say today that yes I have been in a prison and that prison was Kibera.
[time=1119] And we learned that from Albert. Albert buddied up with Kelly and we realized that he wanted out that really is a prison.
[time=1128] And because we were there and encouraging him and Kelly was showing him what he
[time=1134] needed to be able to get out of that prison we were a blessing not only to him but to many and Jeff will go on about leading others to Christ there.
[time=1145] But we did all of that and I want to thank you as a church for the fact that
[time=1151] we partnered with New Life Home and we are a blessing to them in many ways.
[time=1157] Good morning.
[time=1160] It was a privilege to be a part of the team that we were a part of.
[time=1165] It was a lot of fun to be with Kelly and the others and Sarah it was just a it was really good to have a diversity in age a line.
[time=1173] Yeah it was good.
[time=1175] But the site you know you go you want to have an opportunity to be a blessing but I was blessed in so many ways by everyone on the team by the staff at New Life you know by Nicholas who I'll talk about here just a second.
[time=1189] But there's a lot of stories and there's two people that come to mind one is Benson who's about 11-month-old, 12-month-old who is a real serious little guy reminded me of Mr. T you know he's just real kind of looks just like Mr.
[time=1203] T would have looked as a baby I suppose I don't know.
[time=1206] But he took a few days to get a laugh out of him but he and all the other kids that we'd have a chance to feed and hold and love on.
[time=1216] I guess you know God just made me pray for them the way I pray for my
[time=1222] own kids and as I was doing that it was just such a blessing to
[time=1230] to have that role of you know okay I'm daddy for a few days these couple of kids you know and and and hopefully they'll make a difference in their life you know it's only only a few days but just the reality of where these kids would
[time=1245] have been had it not been for the opportunity to be a new life home and they wouldn't wouldn't have a chance and that's that's the reality of it.
[time=1257] Places like new life that that take these kids in and give them what they need and and the staff is just an incredible blessing as well everything they do is is centered to the the benefit of these children everything.
[time=1271] The other person that comes to mind is Nicholas and he's in the picture up here he's the one in the aqua shirt the second from the left kind of in the middle row Nicholas is 22 years old and he's grew up in Kibera and had a chance to talk
[time=1287] with him quite a bit in our afternoon that we spent there and he has six
[time=1293] there's he has five siblings two older three younger a mother his father has
[time=1299] had passed away didn't really hear that story but they live in a two-room house in Kibera that are each rooms ten by ten and and he shares one room with with all of his siblings and just talking to him you could tell he's very intelligent he knows the scripture he's he's definitely called by God to be a
[time=1320] disciple and he could get out of Kibera he really could but he's choosing to
[time=1327] stay there because that's his Jerusalem that's that's his family that's that's his people that that he wants to give an opportunity to know Christ and I was
[time=1338] just really humbled by that I see people every day here my neighbors my co-workers
[time=1344] and what I've been asking God to do is just help me to see people that don't know
[time=1350] Christ people without Christ in their spiritual poverty that's represented in the physical poverty of Kibera and it's it's that it's that drastic it really
[time=1361] is and and I haven't seen people that way in a long time and God's working on me on that and I want to be a discipler so good it's good stuff good thank these guys would you for coming and sharing
[time=1381] well hey let me invite you if you would to open your Bibles to acts chapter two and as you open to acts to let me just invite all of you back into a discussion that we've been having for a couple of months actually so thankful for the break we were able to have last week so thankful for Steve long break and what he was able to teach and share with us from Ephesians 4 and I want to bring you back if I can to this discussion that we've been in we've entitled it after Easter and the
[time=1410] great Easter the great resurrection celebration that we were able to experience a couple of months ago let us as a family kind of on a journey a discovery of what took place immediately following the resurrection and as we've looked into that and as we've read and as we've studied we realized that a great deal took place right after Easter that there were some significant happenings as it relates to
[time=1435] God's redemptive plan for it was after Easter that God literally births his new
[time=1441] redemptive plan the church and as we think about the church and as we think about our church and as we think about this privileged opportunity that God has given us to be the church you know and I know the church isn't this building you and I know the church isn't brick and mortar you and I know that we as believers are the church and this call that God has placed on us to be his redemptive tool
[time=1466] in this culture in this generation boy tell you as we've looked back at this first church and as we've seen their response to God's call as we've looked for the patterns that they established as we look at the priorities that they began to hold on to as we looked at the values that they began to embrace it's been a it's been a challenging and eye-opening and encouraging study and I want to bring you back to that conversation this morning as we've looked at this first church and we've tried to find some things that we truly can pattern ourselves after as we've asked ourselves the question what are the priorities that we should have today yes we know it was 2000 years ago yes we know it was Jerusalem just following the resurrection but are there things that we can see in that first church that today we truly can emulate that today
[time=1519] patterns and values that we can truly follow and there was a resounding yes as we as we've looked at this and as we've studied this there are some things for us I believe my friends that we need to be reminded of and we've kind of stumbled on to a few here and a couple weeks ago we kind of got started in this and I want to finish that discussion this morning one of the things one of the things that the early church did one of the things they were deeply devoted to we saw in Acts two that they were they were continuously devoted the word means obstinate they were obstinate write this down in their gathering they
[time=1556] gathered the early church over and above everything else there was this deep
[time=1562] and intense commitment to as a body as a family be together and they were
[time=1568] gathered a lot they were continuously devoting themselves to this being
[time=1574] together they gathered and they they didn't just gather there were some things that as we read through Acts two there were some things we saw taking place in the gathering some very important endeavors and I want to remind you of two and then I want to I want to introduce you to the third one this morning they gathered to receive teaching maybe you already have that written down if not write that down this morning the early church gathered and they gathered first and foremost to receive teaching and we talked about that we went all the way back to Genesis and we kind of traced our way through God's redemptive plan we traced our way through God's history his story of his people and how he
[time=1613] functioned with them and we saw again and again and again that in God's plan from the very beginning there is always been this huge priority in God's heart
[time=1624] to speak to his people God's God's people have always needed to hear from God
[time=1631] God's words being taught God's words being communicated to God's people has always been God's priority it's always been that way and you see there in Acts
[time=1642] chapter two that they were from the get go they were continuously devoting themselves to the Apostles teaching because it was through the Apostles teaching that this family this faithful band of Christ followers who were though they didn't know it about to change the world they needed to hear the truth they needed to be reminded of what was on God's heart they gathered to receive teaching the early church also gathered my friends to simply be
[time=1672] together and we talked about that we talked about the earthquake that my wife
[time=1678] and I and son experienced back in 94 we talked about the intensity of it we
[time=1684] talked about the near death experience that some of us have had in different situations and we've talked about how in the crisis and in the heartache and in
[time=1695] the pressure of a near death or crisis experience how oftentimes the one thing
[time=1701] we want to do is be with those we love we want to be together and you and I live
[time=1708] in essence we live the earthquake experience every week where we should be
[time=1715] you and I following Christ you and I being devoted to family you and I being
[time=1722] faithful to spouses you and I choosing obedience rather than disobedience you
[time=1728] and I bearing up under temptation you and I living life in a in an extremely
[time=1734] fallen world with an extremely fallen flesh every single day you and I face
[time=1741] the rigor and the battle and the heartache of all that the enemy brings to me and all the enemy brings to you and after six days of that I've told you before and I'll tell you again it's nice to see you it's good to be together it's good to watch you walk through those doors I miss you when you don't and I
[time=1762] see you and I think praise God we're we're here together again another week another chance to encourage and refresh and renew and touch and give you a hug and encourage you and pray with you and study God's word together there's something very very special and it was that way back then and I think in many ways it's the same way today about being together they gathered to receive teaching they gathered to be together and I want you to write this down my friends this is so powerful they gathered in that early church in those first days they gathered and many many still gather today for this reason they gathered
[time=1803] because it was an opportunity to encounter God they gathered to encounter God you
[time=1814] see in the gathering there was this privileged position as the family of God as they came together and as the word of God was taught and as the spirit of God was present they got to be in the present the believing community when it
[time=1830] together has the privilege of being in the presence of God now you and I know that God's presence never leaves us but there is special and unique manifestations of that and when the body gathers boy it's extremely special and so very unique
[time=1848] and I want to just show you one I could show you many I want to just show you one example of this if you would turn to 1 Corinthians 14 so much to show you 1 Corinthians 14 23 to 25 but let me just read this for you and I want you to see this this is in the church at Corinth 1 Corinthians was written about 50 55 AD
[time=1869] here we have you know 10 20 30 40 were 50 years down the road here and but still
[time=1875] very much in the early stages of God's new redemptive tool the church and I want
[time=1881] you to see what's transpired I want you to see the spirit and catch the flavor of this Paul's writing about in 1 Corinthians 14 he's writing about what should happen how the body should function when we're together in a place just like this and he says there's a way that you can do this that's really confusing and there's a way that you can do this that's really helpful so the people are asking about this because they're hearing all kinds of different ideas and all kinds of churches and gatherings are splintering off and beginning already to do it different ways and Paul says hang on let me say it to you like this therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues there's a lot of
[time=1923] things we can do there's a lot of ways we can cut this up he says let's just pick this example if we all gather and everybody speaks in tongues and ungifted
[time=1932] men or unbelievers enter and he's not really asking there if they do he's
[time=1938] assuming it's so cool I love the fact that it was assumed he knew he knew that ungifted unbelieving people were entering this was already a pattern this
[time=1949] was already a habit this was already established you remember in Acts 2 how it said the believing community had found favor with all the people remember now
[time=1959] we get a glimpse of that people are coming people are walking through those
[time=1965] doors week after week many of them ungifted as it says or unbelievers
[time=1971] people still trying to figure out this faith thing trying to understand what it means to know and walk with the Lord he says so if these are coming and they are
[time=1982] and they walk in and everybody's speaking in tongues will they not say that you are mad they're gonna think my goodness this place is tongues other languages
[time=1993] other languages that God gave to communicate the gospel and settings where other languages were needed and now if all they hear is tongues they're gonna think these people are what?
[time=2003] Flicker verse 24 but if all prophesy if it's not tongues that's going on but if
[time=2010] what's going on in the room is prophecy and that word their prophecy is not the prophecy that means future telling this is not the prophecy that means predicting this word prophecy has to do with simply and clearly and only the proclamation of the truth of this that's the prophecy that is referring to here
[time=2031] he's talking about somebody walking through those doors coming into a gathering where what's going on is that the truth is being sung the truth is being
[time=2041] testimonyed the truth is being prayed the truth is being taught the truth God
[time=2048] is the truth God's word being lifted up if those folks walk in and if all are prophesying and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters he has watched this he is convicted by all that he sees and experiences and hears he is called to
[time=2066] account by all of the truth that's being prophesied and proclaimed and he goes on
[time=2073] in verse 25 to say and the secrets of love this and the secrets of his heart
[time=2079] are disclosed and so he will fall on his face and worship God this is somebody
[time=2087] far from God who's walked into an assembly where the truth is being proclaimed fallen his face and worship God declaring that God is certainly
[time=2098] everybody say it out loud among you that God through the proclamation of what's
[time=2107] true when a body is gathered God is certainly among you the body of Christ
[time=2115] my friends has the unspeakable privilege of when gathering yes to receive teaching and yes to be together but one of the great gifts that he gives us one of the great opportunities my friends is that we get to in those settings encounter be with God well how do we do this I mean let's just try and be practical and
[time=2138] think this through I don't want to get too practical and try and explain the mysterious I know it happens I know it's a reality I see it in the scriptures and
[time=2147] you and I have been privileged to experience that presence in the past and I want to just remind us at least to the degree that we can understand that I want you just to be reminded this morning of how that happens you might want to write a few of these things down because you know what you and I need it you and I need that divine touch you and I need that divine presence you and I
[time=2169] need I know I do after six days that privilege of being with him that sense of
[time=2175] his hand on us that sense of his spirit touching and blessing our efforts the
[time=2182] encouragement that it brings how do we so how do we encounter God in the gathering
[time=2188] how does this work well just a couple things for you number one you explain we've already said it here from 1 Corinthians 14 you experience God you encounter God through the scriptures write that down you encounter God through the scriptures when you and I study God's word when we read God's word at night with our kids when we read God's word alone in our room but but but then when we gather same thing and oftentimes to an even greater degree when we're in the room together and we're studying this or we're singing this this is being lifted up this is being proclaimed we encounter God through his very word it makes so
[time=2225] much sense it's his word it's his truth it's what he said you see as you read it
[time=2231] and as we study it we get to we get to sense and we get to hear and we get to come face to face with his I just wrote a few things down his miraculous nature you and I get to see the miraculous parts of him and the things that he's done
[time=2247] and the things that he's doing and the way that he works at times we see through the scriptures we encounter him and his miraculous nature we we get to we get to
[time=2257] meet his heart through the scriptures you and I get to encounter him we get to bask in his presence because we get to we get to see his heart we see his miraculous nature his heart his will when you and I open the scriptures when you and I study the scriptures when the scriptures are taught and proclaimed the will of God for your life and mine gets revealed his character his miraculous
[time=2285] nature his heart his will his character these are the things just a few things about God that are revealed to us as we gather and take in the scriptures how do
[time=2297] we encounter God in the gathering through the scriptures I'll write this down number two through the praise this is good this is important for us to remember through the praise of his people through the praise of his people when we gather
[time=2315] in this room Psalm 22 in the old King James it says he doth inhabiteth the
[time=2322] praises of his people of Israel he doth inhabiteth the praise of his people and
[time=2330] it's a great picture and it's a great truth and it's one worth being reminded of this morning that God himself the scriptures teach inhabits the word means
[time=2340] to take up residence to to be present in God himself it says is present he
[time=2348] takes up residence in your praise in my praise when the people of God gather
[time=2355] and when we praise him notice that it doesn't say that he inhabits your singing
[time=2361] because you can sing and I've I've seen you do it and you've seen me do it
[time=2367] there are times that we've sung and not praised do you understand that there are
[time=2375] times when you and I come into this room and I think sometimes what comes out and sometimes what goes up isn't praise it's just singing but those times when
[time=2385] you and I are willing to come into this room and willing to truly and genuinely focus our hearts and our minds and our souls on him times when you and I are willing to come into this place and while basking in the privilege of being together be present and completely focused before him
[time=2404] not just reading words off a screen but offering the truth of those words to him
[time=2411] in praise and honor and adoration and when you and I are shamelessly and without
[time=2417] hesitation offering praise to him making much of him boasting about him
[time=2425] shouting and singing his glory and his might see when that's going on the
[time=2432] scriptures say God himself inhabits that and his presence comes and is among us
[time=2441] and we encounter God in the gathering through the praises of his people that the scriptures teach he inhabits we encounter God in the gathering through
[time=2451] times of prayer can write that down when we pray I mean again it makes sense
[time=2458] it's logical but it's also so very mysterious and miraculous when you and I
[time=2464] communicate with him when we offer our prayers of confession when we offer our prayers of thanks when we offer our prayers of praise in all the different ways that all the different times that we pray in settings like this we have the privilege of encountering him coming into his presence coming to the throne of God with great confidence and joy we get to encounter him be with him in our
[time=2489] prayer and our communication with him I even wrote down through the sacraments you can write that down through the sacraments I mean I'm thinking about specifically things like communion you know we're trying to help our kids understand that communion's not about crackers and juice it's not a snack boy
[time=2510] it's a serious thing and while we don't believe the crackers and the juice
[time=2516] are the literal representation that we don't believe they're literally his body and his blood we believe they are a powerful symbol they are a representation
[time=2526] of a powerful representation of his broken body and spilled blood and when we remember his death and when we participate in communion it's really serious and awesome stuff it's a chance for us to there in that moment again encounter and be with in the presence of our Lord this gathering thing my friends it's really serious and it's really sweet
[time=2556] that's really listen it's really transcendent it's what separates us listen it's what separates us from the chamber of commerce this this isn't
[time=2567] this isn't just a meeting amen anybody this isn't just a get together we're not
[time=2575] just hanging out you and I can go do that downtown for lunch one day when we
[time=2581] when when you walk into this place when the body of Christ gathers and whether it's in a beautiful room like this or a or a hut with raw sewage ten feet away when the body of Christ gathers there is this privileged blessing
[time=2599] that that is bestowed in this incredible opportunity that we get to receive teaching and be together and be in the presence of God and he's there he says
[time=2611] he inhabits our praises and so I'm begging you all over again and I'm asking
[time=2617] you as moms and dads and I'm asking you as as as young adults I'm asking you as students I'm asking you that call this place home to be like they were to be
[time=2628] obstinate persistent unending absolutely unbending in your commitment to gather
[time=2639] to be together as a body because we need to see each other and we we need
[time=2645] we desperately need his touch and we need the privilege of being taught and being encouraged and being in the presence of God and I would just ask you again to understand the great benefit that comes when you and I make that kind of commitment when you and I give ourselves to that kind of pattern they gathered to encounter God and then I want to show you this as we as we kind of
[time=2669] make our way through and towards the towards some conclusions here they connected they gathered to encounter God I want you to write this down they connected to engage in growth it's not that God wasn't growing them in the
[time=2682] gathering you know that I believe he was I believe God grows us in the assembly I believe God initiates that process and I believe in the gathering and the larger gathering and assembly I think God can can can begin to further that process of growth but what we see in this early church is that not only did they gather in the larger setting but there was this enormous commitment to gathering in smaller settings they did and it was in those smaller settings and
[time=2714] we'll see it here we're gonna just read it acts to again we're gonna go back to the very same passage we read as we talked about the gathering we're gonna show you that in those smaller settings God furthered their growth what he
[time=2727] began in the in the pew so speak he he furthers in the living room what God
[time=2737] begins in the pew he often furthers in the abf classroom on a Sunday morning
[time=2743] what God begins in the gathering he oftentimes furthers in the accountability group that meets in the restaurant booth there were these smaller settings that
[time=2754] these people were obstinately devoted to while God had a history of mighty works in the assembly in the larger gathering
[time=2765] we see here in the early chapters of Acts the Word of God and the Spirit of God doing amazing things in smaller settings as they gathered in the temple courts
[time=2774] and eventually as the church progressed in the public meeting halls and larger facilities God did amazing things but they also gathered as well the text says from house to house and as committed as they were to being together in the assembly they were as committed to being together in private more personal settings living listen living sharing and experiencing all of life together we find them in these smaller settings growing as
[time=2802] disciples growing as followers of Christ working out their faith in the
[time=2809] practicing of the one another's look at acts 241 acts 241 I mean read this to you
[time=2815] I read this to you a couple weeks ago but now as you read it watch how the watch how the smaller gathering stuff kind of pops off the page so then those who had received his word were baptized this is the conclusion of Peter sermon and that day there were added about 3,000 souls instead of 42 they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer everyone kept feeling a sense of all
[time=2844] and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles and all those
[time=2850] who had believed were together and had all things in common and it says in 45 and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all as anyone might have need day by day day by day continuing with
[time=2868] one mind in the temple in the larger gathering and breaking bread from everybody say it out loud house to house they were asking their meal they
[time=2879] were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart and it says in 47 praising God and having favor with all the people and the result of all that was the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were
[time=2895] being what saved saved church history it's been an amazing study for me in
[time=2903] recent days to go back through this and look back through this and ask some questions and find some answers church history tells us that the you can just take that passage we just read you can kind of just break it out into bullet points church history tells us that the teaching of God's word fellowship breaking of bread meaning communion prayer sharing of possessions taking meals together praising God together and God adding to their number of people coming to faith in Christ all of it church history tells us very clearly all of it happened in both the larger setting and the smaller setting God was
[time=2943] up to those things those people were experiencing and giving themselves to all of that in both the larger setting and the smaller setting and they were continuously doing that they were obstinate and through those settings
[time=2960] those two settings God grew them God matured them now I want to say this to
[time=2968] you I'll light you in on some lingo that we often use around here and we use it in a good way we just we talk about our church and our family we talk about the the challenges we sometimes face we we talk about the things the trends and the patterns that we sometimes see that at times can make ministry really enjoyable at times can make ministry difficult and kind of you know head scratching and there has been probably the last ten years a real some real movement
[time=2999] in this area that I want to describe for you here and it's been very distinct and it's been very obvious that over the years more and more and more of you have become what we call one hour people we talk often about one hour folks
[time=3016] and two hour folks and we're not making one better than the other necessarily
[time=3022] this is not me confessing that we speak ill of you behind your back I'm just saying there is a heart in us to try and provide you with what we believe God's word
[time=3033] says you desperately need to grow and become more than an attender but a disciple and as I've read this again and as I've been going through this in
[time=3043] recent days I'm convinced all over again that these people in the early chapters of Acts what do you think they are as you read it what do you think they are do you think they're one hour or two hour or two there are two now I don't want to make
[time=3060] this about Sunday mornings because it's really not about Sunday mornings it's much more than form it's really about function these are a people who were
[time=3070] involved in the gathering they gathered with the family and they were a people who were obstinately devoted to a smaller setting where relationships were
[time=3081] furthered where teaching got furthered where service got furthered where relationships were were were deep and where intimacy was experienced where the
[time=3092] one another's took place and I want to just encourage you we're you're gonna hear a lot more from me in the days to come we've got some great great opportunities for you even now here on a Sunday morning you can go to any number of ABF classes and smaller settings where people are there and willing and ready to encourage you and provide that for you you'll hear as the summer progresses we're thinking about some some additional Sunday morning smaller community settings where you can get involved and get engaged and
[time=3125] meet some people and have a chance to be furthered in these things but I'm so
[time=3131] so very grateful when I look at acts four thirty four one of the great just one boy there's so much more I can't wait to tell you about in the days to come but acts four thirty four my friends just paints one picture of what happens when people are willing and ready to be connected in the smaller setting there are some good things we can do in the gathering there's only so much that can happen there when you're willing to live life together when you're willing to be be it an ABF class or a or a small home group or an accountability group that meets during the week when you're willing to be in those settings and we're pursuing the right things in those settings here's one here's one picture but what happens acts four thirty four sometimes when I
[time=3177] read this verse I just I can read through this first sentence and I just stop and it just blows me away when I really stop and think and I think it'll blow you away when you really stop and think that there was not for there was not a needy person among them there was not there was not there was not a needy
[time=3198] person among them I looked up that phrase this week this word in the Greek
[time=3207] speaks to both the physical and emotional arenas and it doesn't mean they weren't needy it means that their needs were what met it's the one it's one of the
[time=3217] primary purposes of the smaller setting it's one of the primary purposes of the ABF class it's one of the primary purposes of a of a new Sunday morning
[time=3228] community it's one of the primary purposes of a small group my accountability group of gals that meets at the restaurant an accountability of guys that meets at the at the boardroom downtown in the house church or smaller gathering a large
[time=3243] growing church gets small and people get loved on and people get served and people get encouraged they they as you read the scriptures you realize they ate together they prayed together they confessed their sin together they buried each other's burdens together and they exercised their spiritual gifts together think about it my friends no one had a need there were no needs because every need was getting met because they lived that
[time=3276] close and they talked that much and they cared that deeply
[time=3282] they weren't a place marked by gossip they weren't a place or a people
[time=3288] marked by division they weren't a bunch of consumers who were angry and ticked
[time=3295] putting the product back on the rack because they didn't quite do it the way I wanted they just loved each other so deeply with all their differences and all their struggles and nobody had a need and I wrote this down about a week
[time=3311] and a half ago in a community like this in in a smaller setting like the ones we
[time=3317] see in acts two if I fell down which I do I think you all know that I fall I
[time=3326] stumble badly at times I wrote down in a community in a community like this
[time=3333] when I fell down there would always be someone to pick me up
[time=3339] let's just end our time father we were reminded God as we look back at your
[time=3346] first church as we look back at those dear brothers and sisters who gave
[time=3352] themselves completely to this greatest cause of all God we know because we can
[time=3359] read it in your word that there were oftentimes so many of them that needed to be picked up so many times when they needed to be carried and God there are so
[time=3371] many times in our lives where we need that very same thing with trust that comes through intimacy the willingness and the ability God to walk closely with others sometimes on their backs because of their great devotion and
[time=3387] their great love for you that leads them to have such a great devotion and love for us oh God that relationship that comes in the smaller settings those
[time=3397] opportunities God you give us to live and share and experience the realities of life together while we're grateful for these times God in the gathering may you work in us and may you give us the courage to approach those other
[time=3412] settings and give ourselves to them completely God as we in the days to come
[time=3418] here at Blackhawk in a formal way begin to offer and invite people to that
[time=3424] more and more so God may you be at work there and connect just the right people in just the right places God away from the the formal connecting which is a
[time=3435] good thing God may we be a connecting people may we be kind and gracious and loving and willing to come alongside anyone in need and offer them that help
[time=3447] and that encouragement God our hearts have been stirred and our minds have been reminded of a of an early church that gathered and connected and having done
[time=3458] those two things God may we never forget that they went they were a going people
[time=3464] and they went to Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the outermost parts they didn't sit
[time=3470] still they didn't keep it to themselves God they offered it all over the world and may we do the very same thing everybody in the room agreeing and said Amen
