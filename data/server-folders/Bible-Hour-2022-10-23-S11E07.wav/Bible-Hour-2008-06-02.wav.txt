[time=71] "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth." - Therefore go and make disciples of all men,
[time=84] baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

[time=120] - Well hello again, and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=122] We're really thankful that you've tuned in, and I know you can't really see it all, but we're actually in a new setting this morning.
[time=129] We are in the high school gym, here at Black Hawk Christian High School, and we are actually gonna have our morning worship services here in the gym today, and we're doing that for a couple of really important reasons.
[time=140] One is that it's the kickoff to our new summer teaching series, "God Wants You Happy." And to kick us off in the series, which is a study of the Beatitudes from Matthew 5.
[time=151] We're having Dr. Mitchell Cruz come and teach this morning.
[time=154] We're so thankful, as I know many of you are, from Mitchell, grateful for the five years that he gave us here at Black Hawk.
[time=160] And today's kind of a thank you to Mitch, and a chance for him to come back, and not only teach us, but share with us the things that God's been doing in his life, and I can't wait for you to hear about that.
[time=171] We also wanted to just kind of mix things up a bit, you know, it's nice to do that periodically.
[time=176] We have an incredibly nice and extremely comfortable worship center.
[time=182] If you've been to Black Hawk, you know how blessed we are to have such a wonderful facility.
[time=187] And as I was talking with our team in recent days, we just thought it might be a good idea to periodically maybe be a little uncomfortable, if you know what I mean.
[time=197] It's been a joy for me, and an eye-opening experience to travel around the world.
[time=201] And as I do, I realize there are people like you and I that gather every week in settings to worship that are very, very uncomfortable.
[time=209] They don't have nice buildings.
[time=210] They don't have padded pews.
[time=212] Oftentimes they meet in situations that are not only uncomfortable, but even dangerous.
[time=217] And so we're just symbolically today gonna sit in bleachers and maybe be a little uncomfortable, but in the process be reminded of what a privilege it is for us to have all that God's blessed us with.
[time=230] We also wanted to meet in the gym because sometimes people erroneously kind of kind of take the worship center with church.
[time=238] And we're trying to help our people here at Black Hawk No, and we're trying to encourage you with the reality that church isn't a building and church isn't a pew.
[time=246] Church is where you and I are gathered.
[time=249] And so we're gonna gather here today.
[time=251] And we're gonna thank God for all He's given us, and we're gonna love jumping into this study of the beatitude.
[time=257] Say, I hope you'll come by some Sunday this summer.
[time=259] It's gonna be a phenomenal time together, and we'd love to have you with us.
[time=263] We hope you're doing well, and we'd love nothing more than to meet you and come alongside you in the days to come.
[time=269] Enjoy the broadcast this morning with thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=273] God bless you, have a great week, and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=277] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 383 seconds]
[time=664] - I'm a very good friend of mine, Karen, back to come on up, and I want to just tell you briefly what Karen has done.
[time=671] Raise your hand if you remember going through the preparation before Easter, where you're part of that preparation.
[time=677] You remember the cards that we had, the key chain, with all the Bible Scripture references, and the commitment that we made to read God's Word each and every day.
[time=686] Karen helped us put that together, and I was so thankful for that.
[time=690] Many of you were grateful, I know, for what that did to those six weeks, and what it brought to your heart.
[time=696] I know what it brought to mind was really special, and we've just partnered with Karen again.
[time=700] She's been willing to help us with this series that we begin today.
[time=704] My friends, this will be a series that takes us all the way through the summer.
[time=708] We are going to study the Beatitudes, the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, and this idea of how God wants you and I to be blessed.
[time=717] Blessed are the, and he gives us an amazing 10-11 verses there,
[time=724] and that word "blessed" means happy.
[time=726] God really wants you and I to be fulfilled.
[time=729] It's just that we've kind of redefined, fulfilled.
[time=733] Culture has redefined what happiness looks like, and we're going to look over these next 10-11 weeks at what God says it means to be happy.
[time=743] And we've given you, this is an amazing tool.
[time=745] It's a study guide.
[time=747] It's a Bible scripture reading reference guide.
[time=750] It's a chance for you to memorize scripture.
[time=752] Week one begins today, and I just can't wait for you to take this.
[time=756] I hope you'll be committed to it.
[time=758] I really do.
[time=759] I hope you'll be committed to each day reading through the scriptures, each day answering the questions.
[time=765] Use it with your family, use it with your friends.
[time=767] Do it on your own, but Karen's just going to share briefly this morning.
[time=770] Just a few things to encourage you in that endeavor.
[time=773] Thank you for all your work, and thanks for being here this morning.
[time=777] Share with them.
[time=778] Here you go.
[time=779] It's right here.
[time=780] Go right ahead.
[time=781] When I was praying about these scriptures and putting them together, I want to use these scriptures from 2 Peter to encourage you.
[time=789] It's like, "Why be in the Word every day?
[time=792] Why do we need that?" And Peter's just always been one of my models because he has this great enthusiasm
[time=802] and he's always saying, "Oh Jesus, I'm with you to the end.
[time=805] I'll go with you anywhere you go." And he fell down again and again and again.
[time=810] And God used him in such a mighty and powerful way as this humble servant.
[time=814] And so Peter writes these words, if you have your Bibles in 2 Peter, to Christians that were persecuted, that were being invaded by false teachers.
[time=825] They lived in a culture where they really didn't know what all was true.
[time=829] And so he was encouraging them.
[time=831] And it starts in 1 Peter and he identifies himself as a bond servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[time=838] And he says to those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=846] Grace and peace be multiplied in you and the knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=852] And then these verses are once I use often in discipleship.
[time=855] When people come to me and they say, "Really, is God enough?
[time=858] Is Jesus enough?
[time=859] Is there ever going to be really any change for me?" And Peter goes on to say, seeing that his divine power has granted us everything
[time=868] pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence.
[time=875] For by these he has granted to us his precious and magnificent promises
[time=881] so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.
[time=889] And then he goes on and he reminds them to be diligent in this faith journey and he tells them twice to be diligent.
[time=897] And then he says to them, "I'm going to remind you, even though I know you already know,
[time=903] I'm going to keep reminding you of who God is, of who Jesus is, of what he's done."
[time=909] And then in verse 16 he said, "We did not follow cleverly defies tales
[time=915] when we made known to you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty." So Peter writes with that kind of authority, but with that kind of humility as Jesus' bondservant.
[time=928] And there are four truths that I want us to take away as we embark on this daily discipline of scripture reading.
[time=936] First of all, he said, "God has power for his kids.
[time=942] Everything that you're ever going to face for your growth and godliness, he has power for you to live this life." Second thing he says is that his promises are precious and magnificent, and they enable us to live this life here and escape from the snare of sin.
[time=960] The third thing he says, "I am asking you to be diligent in this journey.
[time=967] It takes perseverance.
[time=969] We can't wake up every morning and say, "Oh God, just please make a difference in my life and use me," and then expect it to just happen without giving ourselves to this journey of knowing him and walking in obedience.
[time=981] And the fourth thing that he says, "I'm going to keep reminding you."
[time=987] I don't care how long you've known the Lord, how long you've walked with Jesus.
[time=991] I know you need to be reminded, and I need to be reminded.
[time=995] Even though I've walked with the Lord a lot of years, I need that time with the Lord every morning to be reminded of who he is and his glory and his power and his holiness, his majesty, his truth.
[time=1007] I need to know that, and I know I'm a sinner, saved by his grace.
[time=1013] And I need to be reminded of that when I read this word. His word is truth.
[time=1017] And the only way we're going to be able to live in this world is to immerse ourselves in this truth.
[time=1025] The only way we're going to be able to change is to surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ and allow him to work in our lives. The Beatitudes are just upside down principles for us.
[time=1037] You can read them. If you read them and you're not a believer, they'll sound like craziness to you. If you know Jesus Christ, there's even a part where you'll think, "I can't do that." God's principles, his holy ways, are so much higher than ours.
[time=1053] And he said, "In me, I will make you what I'm committed to making you be for my kingdom." So my desire, my prayer, our hope for you is you enter into this daily reading, the scripture memorization that you'll have a higher view of God when you come to the end of these 10 weeks, that you'll sense his holiness and majesty in your life, that you will find practical ways to live out these beatitude principles and that in the end as you join together, that there will be a sense of camaraderie, there will be a sense of resolve as a body of Christ to live happy, holy, satisfied, contented lives. And I believe that's what will make a difference in our own personal lives, but a difference for us as a church.
[time=1105] Amen. Amen. Amen. Will you thank Karen for all her work and effort?
[time=1113] Yeah.
[time=1117] As I've been reading and studying for the series, my friends, I'll just tell you, it could be a life-changing, heart-changing experience for you.
[time=1125] I really believe that. I hope you'll be here through the summer.
[time=1129] Hey, it's a great honor and privilege to be back with us this morning a good friend. Mitchell Cruz has been part of our Black Hawk family for over five years and has made an enormous impact.
[time=1141] God has used Mitchell and his gifts and his talents and his heart to teach us and to help grow us and I'm so grateful as I know many of you are. A few months ago when Mitchell felt like and we felt like it was time for that next thing that God had for him, he left and we didn't really get a chance to say thanks and I know he'll be back again and we're going to keep doing this.
[time=1165] He and I keep, we keep meeting every week. Some of you asked what happened with me and Mitch. Nothing happened with me and Mitch. We're still great and I love him. He loves me.
[time=1177] He loves this place and what God's doing here and I can't wait to see what God continues to do with Mitchell, but he's here to give us our first message in this series this morning an overview and some great truth for you and I to hang on to.
[time=1189] Before he starts though, for those five years and for the hundreds of ways that he impacted you and this place, could we as a family just thank him and welcome him back to Black Hawk.
[time=1219] Thank you.
[time=1223] Thank you so much. I'm stunned, but not speechless.
[time=1231] Just to catch up a little bit of what's going on in our lives, I've been looking at my life through the lens of a mission statement that I kind of created back in 1992 through the prompting of my uncle who discipled me for about a decade and has since gone to the other side. And I feel called to connect the culture with Christ, connect the culture with Christ through a teaching, preaching, and writing about the Bible. And so that's the lens through which I came here and that's the lens through which I moved to the next thing. And when I got prompted me to sell our business and pursue a masters in doctorate in theology, he provided a way out that I never really thought could exist. And he brought me here. And one of the things that I valued so much that I kind of had to learn to value because I had abused it so much is my family. And I traveled about every weekend and I traveled much during the week, but kind of during the last seven years of owning a business, I got it more right.
[time=1303] But when I was getting my masters in doctorate, I realized that I just thought I valued something that I learned to really value and that's my family.
[time=1311] And so we thought it would be a wise choice to go back to county line which my great-great-grandfather founded 110 years ago. It's a half mile from our home. My brother is a pastor there. My cousin's a pastor.
[time=1327] And we just attend. And it's where our lifelong relationships are including friends and family.
[time=1335] So it's been kind of a restoration time and what I'm working on now is writing. Some of that's taken place for the worksheets that I developed for a radio show on mid-morning. We're on the third Tuesday of every month usually. It's called Wisdom Works.
[time=1351] And you can listen to that live or download it later. And I prepared a worksheet that at the end of the day is almost like a chapter in a book. And that's just been really good for me to spend that time with God, live it out, and then communicate it there. So thank you so much for having me here today. And I really appreciate what you just did.
[time=1371] And just let me pray, please.
[time=1375] God, I thank you so much for every person here and what the collective whole represents.
[time=1383] And God, I just pray today that your spirit who's alive and here right now would communicate inside the four chambers of every person's heart that somehow our wills would be changed.
[time=1399] That somehow our minds would be changed.
[time=1403] That today our spirits would change.
[time=1407] And that today in our emotions we would be changed.
[time=1411] And God, that that change would make us more like you.
[time=1415] And pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1419] Why do we love good service?
[time=1427] You know, on Wednesday mornings the staff, the pastors, we used to get together at Cosmo, sometimes on Colosseum and sometimes at Canterbury Green. That would kind of be the question of that morning is where we going. Didn't want to figure it out the night before. We want to figure it out that morning.
[time=1443] Kind of live in the moment. And whenever Cosmo's I would walk into when I walked in it was Mitch, here's your diet Pepsi.
[time=1451] They'd hand it to me before I'd get to my table.
[time=1455] And if we go to Canterbury Green, Juan Ponoce would take me to this part if you've been there at the back of the restaurant where it's kind of raised up. And he kind of had this joke with me say, "Bitch, you want the VIP seating today?" And he dushed me to the VIP seat.
[time=1467] And I just felt something kind of special because of their service. You know, where I get my car serviced.
[time=1475] It's amazing how they treat me when I call.
[time=1479] When I call and say, "Can I get my car serviced?" And I fill in the blank with a date.
[time=1483] The answer is always has always been yes.
[time=1487] And I think about that and they treat me so well. I go and they give me a car to use and to drive around instead of my existing, you know, cards getting worked on.
[time=1495] And I think, you know, somebody's trained these guys.
[time=1499] And I said, "No." I always say yes.
[time=1503] Well, I grew up a basketball fan. And I played basketball.
[time=1507] And it was on a team that, when basketball was single-class as God had intended it in Indiana.
[time=1515] And we went to the semi-state championship lost by Juan on a very bad call. And it's kind of feeling it all over again right now as I'm thinking about it. But I loved it all as a kid growing up. I loved the 75 team that made it all the way until Scott May got hurt and then got beat by Kentucky right before the Final Four. I loved the 76 team that then went on then to be undefeated and win the national championship. I remember watching each one of those games and how night would call timeout. And he'd say, "This, this, this." And Wilkerson, Buckner, Benson, and May's were going to do this. And they would go out and do it and they'd win. And then, I was probably using your one when Isaiah Thomas and that team won the national championship again. That was so exciting. And then in '87, my senior year in college, getting my degree from Indiana University, they won again with Steve Offord. And Steve and I got beat the same night in the semi-state championship in different places, or we'd have played each other in the Final Four.
[time=1575] And I've kind of gotten to know him, gotten to know Kent Benson. And the Indiana basketball has just been special to me. Well, a couple of years ago, when Indiana had a bad team, they had players, but they had a kind of a bad team, you know, they were struggling. My professor from Indiana University, Doc Leonard in Ginger, invited me to go to an IU Purdue basketball game in Mackey Arena.
[time=1599] And we would sit at half court just like five or six rows up.
[time=1603] It was unbelievable. And guess what they did? They picked me up.
[time=1607] They said, "Mitch, look, we have Diet Pepsi on ice." They said, "Well, I don't want to drink it. They won't let me finish the sentence." They said, "No problem. We'll stop and you can go to the bathroom as many times as you like." And so, pop up that thing. I started sipping away. They took me to Bruno's on the Purdue campus, which is just some of the best pizza in the world, although I'm loving Lexis right now. And so we had their best pizza world serve. And then we walked into Mackey Arena.
[time=1635] And what I was going to say is everywhere we go on campus at Bruno's, everywhere.
[time=1639] Doc and a ginger.
[time=1643] Yeah. This is kind of like cosmos for me.
[time=1647] Mackey Arena is the Doc Leonard. This is cool. So we go in and everybody knows Doc, and we sit about five or six rows up. And it's a close game.
[time=1655] And Matt painters doing his thing with Purdue, and he's really, really, you know, getting into it.
[time=1659] And they're hustling. And Indiana's just frankly quite some more about two or three minutes in the second half something changed in me.
[time=1669] Guy dies for a loose ball. And the crowd goes nuts.
[time=1673] It was a Purdue Boilermaker dough for a loose ball.
[time=1675] The crowd goes nuts. And I find myself doing something.
[time=1679] Yeah.
[time=1683] And I had to wear black by the way. And so I'm telling that whole second half I started cheering for the Purdue Boilermakers.
[time=1695] It happened. I look back on that and I think well what happened?
[time=1703] And here's what I want you to get today. Service had led to surrender.
[time=1711] Service leads to surrender.
[time=1715] And that's the big idea. Jesus taught this as a pattern.
[time=1719] It's an indistinguishable mark of an authentic disciple.
[time=1723] You know, in the Sermon on the Mount, there's kind of this idea of be-do-go.
[time=1727] Be-do-go. Who I am designed to be determines what I am designed to do, which determines where I'm designed to go, and we tend to get it backwards. We think if I go here, especially as guys, if I go here and do this and I'll be this. And with God it's inside out, not outside and it's different. And so what I want to look at today is where Jesus kind of unleashes this idea right after the be-attitudes of be-do-go and it's who is a disciple?
[time=1755] Who a disciple is designed to be determines what a disciple is designed to do and where a disciple is designed to go. Where does he lead?
[time=1763] Why does he do? So if you want to turn on your Bibles to Matthew 5 verses 13 through 16 we'll see Jesus answering these questions.
[time=1775] Do you want to stand as we read it together?
[time=1779] Is that possible? We'll see how it works.
[time=1783] Jesus said to his disciples in 20,000 people,
[time=1793] scholars think, looking on the mountainside, you are the salt of the earth.
[time=1797] But if salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
[time=1801] It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men. You are the light of the world.
[time=1809] A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on a stand and it gives light to everyone in the house in the same way.
[time=1821] Let your light shine before men that they may see your deeds and praise your father in heaven.
[time=1830] And God may it be so for each one of us today. In Jesus name.
[time=1834] Amen. You may be seated.
[time=1838] Service that leads to surrender.
[time=1842] Who is a disciple designed to be? What is he designed to do?
[time=1846] Where is a disciple designed to go? First we're going to look at the B of the B do go and it's in Matthew 5 verses 13 and 14.
[time=1854] You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men.
[time=1862] You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
[time=1866] Be a servant. Fill that in. Be a servant.
[time=1871] Why is a disciple a servant? Well we can go back to the ending of this passage which we'll talk about more in depth.
[time=1878] That it's about good deeds. Good deeds.
[time=1882] So Jesus uses two substances to describe the identity of a disciple. Write this down. The identity of a disciple.
[time=1892] And he uses salt and light.
[time=1895] Now here's what we got to get out of those verses.
[time=1897] Guess what? Salt doesn't lose its flavor.
[time=1902] Light can't be hidden.
[time=1905] So the command is not to be salt and light.
[time=1908] A disciple of Christ already is salt and light. The command is this. Do not dilute the salt or hide the light.
[time=1920] Write that down. The command is to not dilute the salt or hide the light. These would be marks of pretense, of pretending, of a false disciple, of not getting it right.
[time=1932] You see salt was mined from the earth. You are the salt of the earth.
[time=1935] It was a valuable commodity in ancient Palestine.
[time=1938] Wars were actually fought over salt.
[time=1942] In the Old Testament salt was used for covenants and was also used in the sacrificial system for confessing and repenting of sin and for worshiping.
[time=1954] Salt was used in the sacrificial system as well as covenants and it was used for confessing and repenting of sin and as well as worship. It's an interesting little sidebar.
[time=1965] It's the horizontal side to side, my relationships with other people, coming at the intersection of the vertical, my relationship up and down, my relationship with God.
[time=1973] So a disciple is a servant of the new covenant.
[time=1977] A disciple lives a life of serving and confessing his sin, repenting of his sin, and worshiping God. Now light is scripture's metaphor for spiritual life. Light is scripture's metaphor for spiritual life, for the spiritual vitality of eternal and abundant life. And we know that Jesus is the light of the world and when we surrender to him we reflect that light.
[time=2005] It's John 812. Jesus says so beautifully when Jesus spoke again to the people he said I am the light of the world.
[time=2013] Whoever follows me, whoever surrenders to me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.
[time=2021] Jesus is the light of the world and when we surrender to him we reflect that light. So here's what I want you to get. Salt and light are servants to the masses.
[time=2033] Salt and light are servants to the masses.
[time=2037] Now what's the opposite of a servant? How do I dilute the salt or try to hide the light?
[time=2045] And the way I do that is to lord it over others to dictate it over others to kind of come at relationships and tasks from the top down. But a servant comes from the bottom up. He literally bends the knees of his heart. And Jesus really said this so eloquently and clearly. He said to lead we must serve not lord it over from the top down or dictate it over others. That's 2,000 years ago. It's the same thing that we have today. The same kind of circumstances in that Greco-Roman culture and we're going to see it in Luke 22 verses 25 through 27.
[time=2081] Luke 22 verses 25 through 27. Jesus said to them the kings of the Gentiles lord it over them. And those who exercise authority over them call themselves benefactors.
[time=2093] Hey look at me. But you are not to be like that. Instead the greatest among you should be like the youngest. And the one who rules NASB says the one who leads like the one who serves.
[time=2105] For who is greater? The one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table?
[time=2113] But I am among you as one who serves.
[time=2117] Jesus came as a servant.
[time=2121] Servant is the most frequently used title printed on the business cards of biblical characters.
[time=2129] Abraham a servant of the Lord.
[time=2133] Isaac a servant of the Lord. Jacob a servant of the Lord. Moses a servant of the Lord.
[time=2141] Joshua the Lord's servant.
[time=2145] Job God's servant. Mary the Lord's servant.
[time=2149] And so I started thinking about this for my own life.
[time=2153] Thought about it this week. Thought about it when we did this series in common ground.
[time=2157] So a lot of times in my life where I kind of like to lord it over others. Kind of like if my spouse uses a tone but I am ultra sensitive. I think I don't like that. Or if my teenage children make a relational withdrawal without making a relational deposit. You know there is something inside me or if I am doing an auction and somebody just doesn't get what I'm doing and they try to tell me to do it differently or whatever it is.
[time=2189] I started thinking well what would happen if I would look at this differently if I would look at it from being a servant. And if I would say this I am a servant of Christ. I am a servant of Christ.
[time=2201] So in those challenging moments when you get a little push back instead of having that tension come up inside and starting to lord it over others.
[time=2209] What would happen then if I would just say to myself I am a servant of Christ.
[time=2213] No I might not get an A+ at this.
[time=2217] But I started thinking and these relationships when I would feel a little push back and it started to push back inside me I think wait a minute I'm a servant of Christ.
[time=2229] How can I serve Christ here? Wait a minute I'm a servant of Christ. How can I serve Christ here? That's my identity as a disciple of being in Christ. And I felt differently the people I think who encountered me felt differently and there's something that happens inside the heart of all the people involved when we start to see ourselves as a servant.
[time=2257] Rick Warren said you know if you're a servant when you realize how you feel when you're treated like one.
[time=2265] You know whether or not you're a servant when you realize how you feel when you're treated like one and that's challenging. And so what about you? Maybe you're a dentist and somebody tells you how to do dentistry and they've never had the first credit hour of dentistry school.
[time=2281] What if you said I'm a servant of Christ?
[time=2285] Maybe you're an attorney and you're getting advice from a customer from somebody you represent and they've never had the first law book ever enter their hands and you would say well instead of pushing back and lord nobody say well I'm a servant of Christ. What if you're a weather man and nobody understands whether you think come to you and tell you how you got it wrong? What if you would say I am a servant of Christ? What would happen to you if that perspective would change? What would happen in the relationships around you? That's a discussion question that I want you to ask. I want you to ask this how would your perspective of seeing yourself as a servant change if you sincerely said I am a servant of Christ?
[time=2325] A girl heard this in common ground and she sent me an email that next week and said you know I to remember things I wanted to do that because I do want to lord it over others and to remember things I had to write it down on my hand to remember it and so I just wrote down I realized I had written down I'm a sock.
[time=2341] People started asking me what that means because she wrote down I am S.O.C.
[time=2345] servant of Christ. She said I'm a sock and she said I gotta tell you my life changed and my heart changed the people in relationships with me changed and this is one of the most amazing things I've ever experienced but the problem is that we dilute the salt we try to and we try to hide the light when we lord it over others so in your discussion groups address this question how would your perspective of seeing yourself as a servant change if you sincerely said I am a servant of Christ?
[time=2383] The B of a disciple is to be a servant and so that's the identity of a disciple is a servant
[time=2394] and Jesus uses salt and light to describe that identity they serve the masses
[time=2401] and we are called not to dilute the salt or hide the light and so in those difficult situations your perspective would change and I think people will change around you and it did for me when I say I am a servant of Christ I am a servant of Christ next we're going to pick it up on the do of a disciple what's a disciple designed to do and it's Matthew 5 verses 15 and we'll go to 16a neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl instead they put it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house in the same way let your light shine before men let your light shine before men if you want to write it down the do of a disciple is serve he's designed to serve that's what we designed to do and this is the initiative of a disciple this is the initiative of a disciple the identity of salt has the initiative of flavor the identity of light has the initiative of illuminating it illuminates in Christ our identity and our initiative are inseparable our identity and our initiative are inseparable so serving is this risk or this investment of a combination of the three resources of life my time my talent and my treasure serving is a risk or an investment of the three resources of life some combination there I usually think that it tends to be all three my time my talent and my treasure because you see God designed us to serve we're going to look for this thread of good deeds God designed us to serve in whatever the playing field in whatever it is we do Ephesians 210 Paul writes this for we are God's workmanship God's poem we are God's workmanship God's poem the Greek word for workmanship is where we get our word poem created in Christ Jesus created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do servants serve through deeds of love so if you want to write that down God designed us to serve and write this down servant served through deeds of love James the half brother of Jesus said it this way James 2 verses 14 through 17 what good is it my brothers if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds of love can such faith save him such faith meaning that isn't faith suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food if one of you says to him go I wish you well keep warm and well fed but does nothing about his physical needs what good is it in the same way faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead it doesn't exist it's not really faith at all servants serve through deeds of love a disciple serves through deeds of love and then write this down the light of deeds of love can't be hidden the light of deeds of love can't be hidden look what Paul wrote in 1 Timothy 5 25 it's amazing in the same way good deeds are obvious and even those that are not cannot be hidden it's just like if you grew up in church like I did you grew up singing a song this little light of mine I'm going to let it shine won't let Satan it out I'm going to let it shine hide it under a bushel hide it under a bushel I'm going to let it shine let it shine let it shine let it shine Jesus came not to be served but to serve and give his life scholars think that mark 1045 is quite possibly the theme verse of this gospel and look what it says for even the son of man Jesus said even the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many what just kind of hit me I would like to hit you is that I'd like you to think of somebody who has served you in the power that that has we think that if we lord it over come from the top down that something good's going to happen that we'll get what we want but God's designed this kingdom of heaven this unique expression of God's will in your life to be expressed through you and only you and the power of that comes from the bottom up literally bending the knees of my heart not only to God and Christ but then to the person I'm locking eyes with so here's what I'd like you to do I'd like you to serve if you want to write it down like you to serve I'd like you to this week rather than look for opportunities to be served I'd like you to look for opportunities to serve rather than look for opportunities to be served I'd like for you to look for opportunities to serve and to do that you want to write this down we're going to find the lead the need and the deed say it with me we're going to find the lead the need and the deed I was in sales and marketing so the lead is the person that I was going to prospectively do business with so the lead here is our prospect to serve it's the person in need the need is the time talent or treasures or whatever combination is lacking in a person's life what portion of the three resources of life is lacking what time talent and treasure is lacking in the person's life and then the deed the act of service that you will do the act of service that you will do to meet that need so here's what I'd like you to do in your discussion groups I'd like you to just take an overview of this week's calendar and I'd like you to think about well well who is it who is it I'm going to lock eyes with who is it to find that lead the person in need and say well this is the need this is the time talent or treasure lacking in that person's life and then this is the deed this is the act of service that I'm going to do and you probably won't be able to get around the whole table or through the entire group and the bleachers but I'd like you to address that discussion right now look at your calendar and say define the lead the need and the deed for this week it was fun having that discussion
[time=2837] with my family it's kind of funny but we need to move on the B of a disciple who the disciples designed a B is a servant that's the identity just like salt and light the we're designed what we're designed to do is to serve and that's in any arena and that's the initiative of disciple just like a salt brings flavor that's its initiative and light illuminates and so this week define the lead the need and the deed I mean make it real next is the go where does all this go where does a desire will design to design to go as he serves and fill this in it's surrender
[time=2883] surrender look at the last part of verse 16 as Jesus closes this out in the same way let your light shine before men that they may
[time=2893] see your good deeds that they may see your deeds of love your service your serving and do what and praise your father in heaven and surrender praises this idea of bending my knees and lifting up of surrendering to your father in heaven that's where this goes this is the influence of a disciple salt is a identity its initiative is that it brings flavor and the influence is that it brings out taste light is the identity its initiative is that it illuminates and the influence is that people see the disciple our identity is a servant our initiative is to serve and the influence is surrender service that leads to surrender to a god to our father in heaven this is amazing salt helps others taste and even causes thirst there's light helps others see and we need to reconcile that a minute if your Bible scholar you think well wait a minute and there's sermon on the mount in Matthew 6-1 Jesus said be careful not to do your do these good deeds in front of people so that they see them and what reconciles that with this is the motive if you're doing it just so other people see you then that's not what it's about but if you're doing it with a servant's heart and you're really serving you define the the lead the need and the deed that's what makes it different it all goes back to the heart service helps others surrender to god service leads to surrender the lost surrender look how Peter wrote it first Peter 2 12 the lost surrender when we do good deeds and we serve lives such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day he visits us reveal glorify is reveal God's character and presence on the day he visits us the found surrender the writer of Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and 25 says this and let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but let us encourage bring heart to one another and all the more as you see the day approaching this is God's designed for our gifts Peter wrote it this way in verse Peter 4 10 and 11 becoming two of my favorite verses in all the scripture each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms so people are going to see him if anyone speaks he should do it as one speaking the very words of God and if anyone serves he should do it with the strength God provides so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ to him be the glory and the power forever and ever amen there's this parable that I shared with the group here at black hog before we went out to serve and the parable goes like this a peasant in a kingdom this picture of medieval kingdom a peasant only has a garden to his name and he has this best product the less produce of his garden was this carrot it was beautiful and he desires to take the carrot and give it to the king and the king says thank you isn't isn't your garden adjacent to my land and the peasant said yes he said I'm going to give you a hundred acres peasants said thank you a noble man was looking on and he thought hmm a hundred acres for a carrot I wonder what you get if you give the king a horse so he takes the king a horse and he gives it to the king and the king says thank you and he goes on his way and the nobleman says wait stop king I saw the peasant give you a carrot and you gave him a hundred acres I gave you a horse and you didn't give me anything what what's going on the king looked at the nobleman and said the peasant gave the gift to me you gave the gift to yourself that's the difference of lording it over of hiding the light or diluting the salt and serving coming in with a heart that's from the bottom up and so here's what I'd like you to do when you when you say the servant of Christ and you serve you define the lead the need and the deed I'd like you to do this right this down surrender the opportunity and the outcome to God surrender the opportunity and the outcome to God I want you to look for opportunities to use your gifts to lead someone to surrender to Christ no matter what the arena is this is not something that takes place only in this building I want you to look for opportunities to use your gifts to lead someone to surrender to Christ service leads to surrender because serving illuminates the heart of Christ and draws others to him that's why serving satisfies us more than being served Paul quoted Jesus as saying this in Acts 20 verse 35 he said it's more blessed you're gonna be more happy you'll be happier if you give than when you receive you'll be happier when you serve and rather than be served and here's the big idea Christ in us cannot be deluded or hidden if we have truly surrendered our hearts and lives to him because it's not merely me serving no it's Christ in me and people see him and he can't be diluted and he can't be hidden and then they praise my Father in heaven because they see Christ in me I increase he increases and who we are to be determines what we are to do which determines where we are to go and I I just got to share this with you and I'll close the I'll let you in on a window in my soul some nights when I can't quite fall asleep and Corbin if you want to come up be great some nights when I can't fall asleep by God rings to me in my mind pictures and images of people who I was a part of with you who surrender their lives to Christ and I think well what if what if those scores of people what if we didn't surrender the opportunity to actually lead them to Christ and what if we just didn't surrender the outcome what if we like forced them and pressured them micromanaged it but then I see Vern and I see Deanna and I see Troy and I see Regan and I see all these people whose lives are changed because it was modeled to me through the elders and the staff who had a foresight beyond what I had to be servants and to serve other people that when you're serving those people you surrender the opportunity to lead them to Christ and just surrender the outcome to him and then guess what they do they become servants and they serve and others surrender to Christ because they're surrendering the opportunity and the outcome. The team's gonna sing and I just would love it if you would just pray to God as they sang that you would make this song your prayer and say God reveal reveal the spirit of God Christ the servant in me I am a servant of Christ help me to help me to realize that's my identity this week I'm gonna serve God define and define in me that lead that that need and that deed and God I will surrender the opportunity and the outcome to you because who you've designed me to be is going to determine what I've been designed to do which is going to determine where I've been designed to go.
