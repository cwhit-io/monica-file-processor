[time=251] Well, good morning, and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=253] My name is Kelly Bird.
[time=254] And then I have the privilege of serving as the senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=258] And we're really thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=260] We're going to continue today in our series from the Beatitudes in Matthew 5 entitled, "God Wants You Happy." And we want to continue to remind you that he does.
[time=270] God wants you deeply happy.
[time=272] It's just that our definition of happy and God's definition of happy are sometimes drastically different.
[time=279] And in this series, we're going to try and bridge that gap helping you and those here in the Blackhawk family understand what it means on God's terms to really truly be happy.
[time=289] Before we get into the message though this morning, I can't wait to have a friend of ours join us and tell you more about an organization that we've grown increasingly excited about here at Blackhawk.
[time=302] It was a couple of years ago that we did a series entitled "Kidnapped." "Kidnapped" Satan's attempt to abduct our next generation was what we entitled it.
[time=314] And you know and I know that not much has changed.
[time=318] The enemy's effort to continue to influence our kids away from that, which is right and true and good, has only multiplied.
[time=326] And so I'm so grateful for Remedy FM and my friend Clinton Foppel.
[time=332] Hey, Foppel.
[time=333] Hey, Kelly. How you doing?
[time=334] Good, man. Good to see you.
[time=335] Clinton and his team down at Remedy FM have started an online radio ministry basically that I'm going to have Clinton tell you about here.
[time=343] He was here about six months ago and many of you wrote in saying how encouraged you were by what Clinton and his team are giving themselves to with the students and the youth here in our city.
[time=355] And I wanted Clinton just to give you an update of how things are progressing.
[time=359] Some of you maybe didn't see that six months ago so Clinton give him kind of a brief backdrop and then tell the folks how things are progressing with the effort, maybe even how they can continue to support you guys.
[time=370] It's hard to believe that it was six months ago and eight months ago is when the station actually launched.
[time=375] The story is real simple and yet profound.
[time=378] Charbonkely WBCL radio, one day traveling down 469 with her grandson, heard for the first time mainstream hip hop.
[time=384] You talk about kidnap. This is a genre of music that is literally taking our young men and women captive, over sexualized themes, telling them that really their life is nothing more than an experiment and do everything that they can to be able to enjoy life now because there's not much after life.
[time=399] And so we've been on the air again for eight months talking to young people about the fact that they can live their life on purpose and not by accident.
[time=406] Introducing them to the Bible for the first time and telling them about concepts that they may never otherwise hear about because a lot of these kids are not interested in organized religion.
[time=416] I'm really excited about the series you're doing about happiness because I guess our goal is to tell these kids that happiness is best achieved when you play in bounds and when you do things the way God your creator instructs you to live your life.
[time=428] And so I guess in many ways we're partnering in this series because we want to be able to tell these kids that true happiness is happiness that is finding your purpose and find out who you uniquely created to be.
[time=439] And so we want to be a part of that and so we're grateful to be here at BlackRock again.
[time=443] Awesome, awesome. Now just remind our folks this is an online opportunity.
[time=449] It is an internet only radio station and the reason why is because of the 72 million that this generation has in it.
[time=456] 72? 72 million, it's gigantic. It's the second largest generation ever.
[time=460] Between the ages of 12 and 18, maybe 20 we could stretch it to 20.
[time=466] But 93% of them Kelly spend all of their time interacting socially on the web.
[time=471] Now they find their time at school and of course other places but this is where they really open up.
[time=475] This is where they actually find the answers that they're looking for and of course you know that if your education comes from Wikipedia and the various websites that we go on
[time=485] it's going to be a very mixed up understanding of what their life's all about.
[time=489] So we're internet only at remedy.fm that's www.remedy.fm.
[time=494] Not.com because we are a .fm internet radio station.
[time=498] Awesome, wow. So moms and dads you're not going to find this on your radio dial.
[time=503] This isn't something you listen to in the car. This is something your kids and you hopefully get to listen to.
[time=510] They're on your laptop or your home computer and I'm so grateful.
[time=514] We are so thankful for Clinton and I hope you'll look them up.
[time=518] I hope you guys will tune in as they say and just know that we're partnering with these guys to do our very best to encourage this next generation to be the young men and the young women that God has called them to be.
[time=530] Thank you again for tuning in. Thanks to Clinton and his team and we'll see you next week on the broadcast.
[time=536] God bless you and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=566] [MUSIC - 51 seconds]
[time=622] Let's sing this with us. [MUSIC]
[time=630] [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=784] I know there's a lot of people in this room this morning who, in all honesty and transparency before God, you would too like me say I'm amazed.
[time=796] Amazed God by your faithfulness.
[time=798] Amazed with your patience.
[time=801] Amazed at the second and third and fourth and fifth opportunities you give me day after day.
[time=809] I know there are many of you in the room who are aware of the great truth of Philippians 1-6 where it says he who began a good work in you.
[time=818] Because of his great love, because of his long suffering spirit, he is a God who amazingly continues to walk with you and me.
[time=829] He's going to perfect in us this faith and it's amazing if you ask me and I know you would agree.
[time=837] Oh God thanks for your willingness to walk with broken people.
[time=842] God thanks for your redeeming love that continues to break through our stubbornness and our sinfulness.
[time=849] Oh God thanks for the blessings that you give and know this morning that there are a large number of people
[time=857] here gathered in this room who are truly amazed by your grace and truly thankful for your love.
[time=865] All of those amazed thankful people agreed and said amen amen thank you Chris.
[time=873] Well hey before we jump in this morning to this series that we began last week.
[time=878] And let me just say to those of you who were here last week if you joined us in the gym.
[time=882] Thank you so much for your flexibility and your willingness to do a new thing.
[time=887] It was a joy to be together.
[time=889] I heard story after story of people who met new people, table discussions that were actually meaningful and encouraging.
[time=896] And we'll do that again in the not too distant future and it was a great reminder I think for all of us.
[time=902] That wherever we are, be it in a comfortable room or an uncomfortable gym, the church is gathered.
[time=911] And we're thankful for that and glad you were there as we kicked off our new series from Matthew Chapter 5.
[time=917] God wants you happy.
[time=919] And we're going to talk more about that this morning.
[time=921] Before we do that, I want to just invite all of you guys in the room who are dads.
[time=926] Would you just stand for a moment?
[time=928] I'm going to say a couple things and then we're going to give everybody a chance to kind of respond.
[time=932] I know you may not want to do it guys but just join me and stand here this morning if you're a father.
[time=938] This is a good day.
[time=939] This is a day we set aside to celebrate and thank those of you who are dads.
[time=944] And you may be young dads and you may be old dads.
[time=947] You may be somewhere in the middle.
[time=949] But we think it's worth noting that what you do as a dad, the investment that you make, it's significant.
[time=957] It's important.
[time=958] And whether you've been making it for a few months or for years, we want to this morning encourage you.
[time=963] First of all, I want to say thank you.
[time=965] You, like me, may feel at times that your investment, that your efforts fall short.
[time=972] You, like me, may at times be frustrated by the lessons that you thought you learned, that you continue to repeat.
[time=978] You, like me, may be in need of God's continuing amazing grace and strength as we try our best with His help to love and care for these that God has given us to care for.
[time=990] I imagine most of us are in that boat.
[time=993] Well, I also want to just say thanks even though you and I would admit our frailty.
[time=998] I know most of you are still in the game.
[time=1001] You're still giving yourself to that effort.
[time=1004] You really are trying with His help.
[time=1006] And that's commendable.
[time=1008] And wherever you might need help or wherever you might need encouragement, like me, I hope you'll ask.
[time=1014] I hope you'll reach out to those who maybe could encourage you and hold you accountable.
[time=1018] I hope that you'll continue to live in relationship with us in an honest way.
[time=1023] And I wish this investment, my friends, into their hearts and into their lives is one of the greatest privileges God has given you.
[time=1032] I know you may make money and I know you may have influence and I know you may give yourself to certain endeavors away from that home or those little ones.
[time=1042] But make no mistake, there is no investment of your time and energy and effort that is more eternal, more significant than the one you're making in them.
[time=1052] We're thankful that you're doing that.
[time=1054] We want to stand with you in that process and we're grateful for what you do each and every day.
[time=1059] Thanks for being a dad and accept our gratitude as a family for those efforts.
[time=1065] Thanks, Dad. Happy Father's Day.
[time=1068] You can be seated.
[time=1073] Hey, let me ask you to do something here.
[time=1075] Just take a moment and in the spirit of last week in the gym and I really hope you'll just go ahead and go with this.
[time=1081] Perhaps there's someone sitting next to you that you know and that you might feel comfortable just saying a couple things too.
[time=1088] If you're sitting next to a complete and utter stranger, you could say hello and give it a shot.
[time=1093] It's really not a big deal. I want to just ask you a question.
[time=1096] If you kind of just were honest about it, just being honest as a human being, you know, just like me, we're just going to shoot straight here.
[time=1103] What were a couple things, maybe two or three things you can think of in the last week or so?
[time=1109] Maybe it's just the last couple days. Tell the person next to you or some folks around you.
[time=1113] Just a couple things that you've done in an effort to try and be happy.
[time=1121] You were sad. You were lonely. You were discouraged. You were hurting.
[time=1126] And so you thought really genuinely like you and I do.
[time=1129] You thought if I do this, if I go there, whatever it was, just think of a few things just honestly that we do at times.
[time=1138] In our pursuit of happiness, we want to feel better.
[time=1142] We want to be satisfied. We want to be content. We want some peace.
[time=1146] And so we do this or we do that or we, you know, purchase something or just talk about it.
[time=1152] I know it's embarrassing. Maybe you may be being a little vulnerable here.
[time=1163] It's a good thing.
[time=1169] What is it that you do? Where is it that we go at times in an effort to find happiness?
[time=1181] Here's really the foundational principle of this entire series that we're jumping into here.
[time=1192] The fact of the matter is, this is the deal, for the most part.
[time=1196] I mean, there may have been some of you in the room who went spiritual on me there, which is okay.
[time=1201] But for the most part, most of you answered, you talked about things that you do.
[time=1208] You talked about places you go. You talked about responses you have in your effort to be happy.
[time=1213] Whatever it is you said, for the most part, cross the board here in the room.
[time=1220] What you're going to see and learn in the next 10 weeks is that it didn't work.
[time=1225] It didn't really make you happy.
[time=1232] And what we have here is an issue of definition.
[time=1236] We are going to try our very best with God's help and the help of the Scriptures to redefine happy.
[time=1246] I hear people say sometimes God doesn't want you happy, God wants you holy.
[time=1250] I understand that.
[time=1251] And we say that because we're functioning with this definition of what culture and society have said to us is happy.
[time=1257] Cars, wealth, pleasure, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[time=1262] But understand this morning as we jump into this, that the Scripture is very clear, that there is a definition of happiness,
[time=1270] that is God's definition of happiness, and He wants you happy by His definition.
[time=1276] And that is laid out for us in this amazing passage we find in Matthew chapter 5.
[time=1281] In Matthew chapter 5, 6, and 7 we find what countless scholars and theologians have called the single greatest sermon ever given.
[time=1290] Jesus' overview of true Christian living.
[time=1295] You ever want to know about that? I would encourage you.
[time=1297] You ever want to know about true Christian living? I would encourage you to read Matthew 5, 6, and 7.
[time=1302] It's known as the Sermon on the what? The Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1306] And as you begin to read through this amazing discourse, you see right at the outset, right at the beginning of chapter 5,
[time=1313] you see an 11 verse section that contains a very interesting, a very clear and obvious literary rhythm, we'll call it, okay?
[time=1323] This literary rhythm just jumps off the page, and it's a literary rhythm,
[time=1329] and it has some truth in it that will form the basis of our study and discussion over the next 10 weeks.
[time=1336] I can't wait. Let me read these verses for you this morning, and then allow me some time to make a few comments regarding the backdrop
[time=1343] and context of this teaching, and then we'll jump into our first beatitude this morning.
[time=1348] Would you in honor of God's word stand and allow me the privilege of reading to you this morning, Matthew 5, verses 1 to 12?
[time=1357] It says this, "When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and after he sat down, his disciples came to him,
[time=1365] and he opened his mouth, and he began to teach them, saying, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1374] Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[time=1378] Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.
[time=1382] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
[time=1388] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
[time=1392] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[time=1396] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
[time=1401] Blessed are those who have been persecuted, for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1409] Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
[time=1419] Rejoice and be glad for your reward in heaven is great, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
[time=1431] Pray with me, would you?
[time=1433] Father God, we stand again in this gathering thankful to be able to gather and God humbled by the opportunity again to subject our hearts and our souls and our minds and our lives to you and your truth.
[time=1448] Oh God, as we gather, we gather to receive teaching.
[time=1453] We gather for the privilege of fellowship and God we gather to encounter you and as we encounter you and your truth and this beginning of your defining what it looks like to be one who follows your son.
[time=1469] This beginning of the Sermon on the Mount where kingdom living and kingdom thinking are described, God, we anticipate and we look forward to what you'll teach us.
[time=1481] Oh God, I pray that every heart and mind and soul in this room would be humbled before you this morning, that we would in that humbled state be receptive to what your word and your spirit would have for us today.
[time=1496] Please, God, grow us and teach us and remind us and convict us.
[time=1501] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1504] You may be seated.
[time=1506] Well, a couple of side notes here, important side notes, before we jump into the text in our first beatitude, I want you to see a phrase here at the beginning.
[time=1515] Go back to chapter 5 verse 1 and it says here when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain, he went up on the mountain when he saw the crowds.
[time=1526] What we have here, I want you just to understand the context of that day, this is often how public speaking, this is often how a message that needed to be given was given.
[time=1535] They didn't have auditoriums, they didn't have meeting halls, they didn't have amplification systems.
[time=1540] No, when somebody wanted to make a public speech, they would oftentimes gather on a mountain top.
[time=1546] And the people would gather on the down slope of that mountain, the people would gather in the ravine of that mountain as it started to go up to the next mountain, and they would gather on the mountain side of the other mountain.
[time=1558] Almost amphitheater-ish, if you follow, and on this day, scholars will tell you that probably there in that mountain side, ravine and mountain side, probably 15 to 20,000 people gathered to hear the master rabbi teach and begin to talk about for the very first time this kingdom of God that was coming.
[time=1583] But here's what I want you to see. When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and after he sat down towards the top, his disciples came to him.
[time=1596] He opened his mouth, it says in verse 2, and began to teach who? Who do you think the...
[time=1607] And after he sat down, his disciples came to him.
[time=1613] He opened his mouth and began to teach them. Who do you think the "them" is? The disciples.
[time=1620] It's very important. We're going to come back to this in just a moment. But I want you to see that. I want you to see the 12 of them sit... I want you to see it in your mind's eye.
[time=1629] I want you to see the 12 of them sitting at his feet toward the top of this mount.
[time=1634] And I want you to see beyond the 12, the 15 to 20,000 people listening in.
[time=1640] 15 to 20,000, of whom there you know and I know. There were in that crowd those who were convinced and those who were not.
[time=1648] There were those in that crowd who were hurting. There were those in that crowd who were searching. There were those in that crowd who were religious.
[time=1654] There were those in that crowd who weren't. There were those in that crowd who were part of the religious system.
[time=1660] And they were part of that crowd. I'm sure of folks who had no idea who this guy was.
[time=1666] What an amazing scene. 12 primary audience guys, the disciples, thousands of others.
[time=1675] And as he begins to speak, we immediately see this literary pattern, if you will, blessed are the poor, but blessed are those who mourned.
[time=1685] And blessed are the gentle, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[time=1690] I want you to write this down. That word blessed, it's a word that means happy.
[time=1696] It's a word that means truly, deeply happy.
[time=1701] And I think it's important right out of the gate here in our study to acknowledge the fact that our passage will teach us that the Lord Jesus Christ is committed here in this teaching.
[time=1712] And he's committed in his coming to provide true happiness.
[time=1717] Jesus Christ came into the world to provide for those that know him true, lasting, deep joy, real, complete happiness.
[time=1730] The Greek word is macarias. You can write that down. M-A-K-A-R-I-O-S macarias is the Greek word.
[time=1738] And while we see it used nine times here in these opening 11 verses of Matthew 5, the word is used over 50 times in the remaining books of the New Testament.
[time=1749] The word macarias, blessed, refers to listen. It refers to the blissful and content condition of the soul.
[time=1758] Raise your hand if you'd like to have a soul whose condition is blissfully content. Raise your hand if that sounds good.
[time=1767] And here's good. Here's the point. I know why you raised your hand. You raised your hand. Listen, because that's the way God designed you.
[time=1776] In our original design, before sin ever came in and botched things up, you and I were made by God to live in a relationship with him whereby our souls would be constantly and thoroughly because of him and because of our relationship with him and his relationship with us.
[time=1794] We were designed to be blissfully content at the soul level. That's just you and I functioning naturally, the way we were made to function before sin.
[time=1808] Now after sin, we start going other places and other directions for that blissful contentedness, some of those things you mentioned to your neighbor as you talked a few moments ago.
[time=1823] Macarias blissfully content, lasting, deep joy. We'll come back to that.
[time=1832] Let me now come back to what we said earlier about the disciples. Primary audience, the disciples. Secondary audience, those who were just listening in.
[time=1842] And I want to say this with great sensitivity. Most of you know me and you know my heart. I wouldn't be insensitive about this.
[time=1849] We wouldn't as a people here being sensitive about this issue but we want to say the truth here and I want to say it directly because I think there's great implication but I want to say it with heart as well.
[time=1864] Here I go. The scriptures are very, very clear my friends that this deep lasting blissful happiness is only for the redeemed.
[time=1880] What do I mean by that? Well in other words, and you can just write this down and it's true. Only those who have fully surrendered their heart and life to Christ get to be what?
[time=1892] Say it. Happy.
[time=1897] It's great implications there.
[time=1900] Stuff for you and I to think through. Nowhere in scripture is the word macarias used in conjunction with an unbeliever.
[time=1907] Nowhere in scripture is this word macarias which means deep lasting personal joy and peace.
[time=1913] An inward bliss and a contented soul. Nowhere in scripture is that word used in conjunction with unbelievers.
[time=1919] It is instead used repeatedly again and again and again to describe the happiness and the fulfillment found in knowing and walking with the Lord deeply.
[time=1932] So, so we deduce from that a few things. So you and I can deduce from that that that hitting a game winning home run, hitting the game winning shot, scoring the game winning goal isn't happy.
[time=1949] Culture tells us it is. It's not happy. It's not macarias. It's a good feeling and feelings are okay but feelings are brief and fleeting and passing.
[time=1960] Finally getting asked out on that date, finally getting noticed by that guy you've longed to be noticed by, finally getting a chance to go out and have some companionship that's not happy.
[time=1973] It's not macarias. It's a good feeling and feelings are okay but feelings are brief and futile and fleeting.
[time=1983] Getting that raise, that work, getting that bump and pay, getting that promotion which finally put you in that upper tax bracket that you have long to be in isn't happy.
[time=1997] It's not macarias. It's a good feeling. Feelings are okay but feelings are futile, fleeting. They don't last.
[time=2008] Buying that certain car or acquiring that certain business that you've acquired is important as that might make you feel as legitimate of a reward as that might be.
[time=2020] For certain efforts made it's not happy according to the scriptures. It's not macarias. It's a good feeling but feelings are okay but they're futile and fleeting and they don't last.
[time=2031] Getting in with that certain group of friends, being invited to dinner with that certain group of couples, getting that scholarship that you long to get, it's all okay, it's not happy though, it's not macarias.
[time=2044] See we have a definition issue here my friends when it comes to happiness and what we learn here is this, being saved.
[time=2053] Being redeemed is happy. Knowing him, not knowing about him, knowing him personally, intimately, having bowed the knee of your heart, having given up every part of you to him, an absolute surrender and subjection.
[time=2071] Being saved is happy and here's how I want to say this and again I want to say this with great love but with great forth-rightness.
[time=2081] Here's the implication. So if you don't know him, if you don't or haven't experienced his redeeming love, you'll never ever, ever be what? Happy.
[time=2101] You understand that? You'll never, ever, you'll never, ever, ever be happy. Your soul will never be content. You will never be fulfilled.
[time=2116] You will never experience deep, meaningful, lasting joy unless you know him.
[time=2126] Augustine once said, "Man's soul is restless," which I think is true. "Man's soul is restless until it finds its rest in him."
[time=2144] Macareas, deep joy, real happiness found only in him. Let's look at our verse 3. Jesus begins here, his trip through the beatitudes.
[time=2155] He begins with blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed. Happy are the, here comes the, here comes the, you'll see this as we read through these beatitudes.
[time=2165] They are completely counter-intuitive for you and I as fallen beings. The way we think, the definition of happiness we've been functioning with.
[time=2174] They're all counter-cultural. They're all counter-intuitive. They to the normal person like you and I, without God in the picture, make absolutely no sense.
[time=2185] But he says, "You want to be happy? You want to be fulfilled? You want deep-lasting joy? Blessed are happy are the poor."
[time=2192] We're not physical, poor. We're not talking, homeless, no clothes, like literally on the street, no money in my, no, we're talking about our spiritual personal condition.
[time=2204] And he says, "Happy are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God." Poor in spirit, Jesus in essence says you can't be happy.
[time=2211] You won't ever experience deep-lasting joy and you certainly won't ever enter the kingdom until you recognize what he's talking about here.
[time=2219] His you and I recognizing, admitting and confessing our poorness of spirit, spiritual poverty.
[time=2229] Your bankrupt, and I want you to see it this way, left to yourself, your bankrupt, sinful, broken, shattered spiritual condition.
[time=2241] I read something several times over the past few weeks and was struck every time by its profound implication.
[time=2249] This person asked a great question. They asked, "Why does Jesus?" This is the first we've heard from Jesus in terms of a teaching or a message.
[time=2260] And this person asks, "Why does he start here?" It must be significant. It's the first thing said, the first thing recorded in terms of actual preaching from Jesus.
[time=2270] Why does he begin with this one? Because this person says it is the fundamental characteristic of the true Christian.
[time=2278] It is the fundamental characteristic of the citizen of the kingdom of heaven. All other characteristics flow from this one.
[time=2285] This is where everything starts. This is where happiness and fulfillment begin. This is where entrance into the kingdom begins.
[time=2293] Jesus begins his earthly ministry by saying, "There's a mountain you have to scale. There are heights you have to climb."
[time=2300] But the first thing you must realize is that you are outside the kingdom of God and you can't get there.
[time=2306] You are unable to scale it on your own. The mountain is too high. The heights are too great.
[time=2312] You in and of yourself can't do it. And you have to start, this guy says, with that realization.
[time=2322] Do you have that realization? This morning, are you deeply and personally and accurately aware of the serious and unbelievable limitations that you bring to this mix?
[time=2339] You cannot enter my kingdom. He says, "You cannot be happy until you realize your bankruptcy, your poverty."
[time=2346] For me to say all of that to you today, in our context, for me to just say what I've said so far this morning about poor in spirit to you, in the world you live in.
[time=2356] In the mindset that you and I exist in, I think it makes a lot of sense.
[time=2361] But I've told you for years that we've always got to try our best to understand the scriptures and the context, the direct immediate context that they're communicated in.
[time=2371] And now go back to the mountain top, go back to the ravine, go back to the 15 to 20,000 people, go back to Jewish culture, first century, and think about it.
[time=2384] This would be very significant teaching to the Jews, to the Jews who are very proud about their religious achievements, very proud about their ceremonial accomplishments, very proud about the sacrifices.
[time=2400] They've offered to God very proud about their zeal for the law, very proud these Jewish religious people are about their circumcision, about their identification with the covenant people of Israel.
[time=2413] Very proud about their self-righteousness. They were a self-confident people. They were self-important, some would say.
[time=2421] And Jesus says, "If you're going to enter the kingdom and find true happiness, you've got to recognize that you have absolutely nothing.
[time=2431] You are bankrupt spiritually." And this is where it all begins. Poverty of spirit is the foundation of all other graces.
[time=2441] Poverty of spirit is where everything starts. You may as well, somebody once said, expect fruit to grow without a tree.
[time=2450] As the other graces to grow in your life without this one, nothing happens until this happens.
[time=2459] One author said it this way, "As long as a person is not poor in spirit, that person is not capable of happiness in the sense that God offers it.
[time=2470] That person is not capable of entering the kingdom. As long as I'm clutching my own self-importance, my own self-righteousness, my own accomplishments, and my own religiosity, and my own morality,
[time=2484] as long as I'm holding on to this, as if somehow I'm holding on to this, as if it somehow gained me access to God, as long as my hand is full of that dirt, it can never receive the gold of God's grace.
[time=2503] Happiness is only for those who are what? Say it out loud. Unworthy.
[time=2512] Let me just give you one layer down.
[time=2516] As far as I'm going to go this morning, let me give you one layer down of really, really interesting detail on this.
[time=2523] One layer down, poor in spirit. I want you to see for yourself, because I'll tell you, when I saw this and when I realized this all over again as I studied this, it was just amazing to me.
[time=2536] I want you to see this. There are, in the Greek language, which the New Testament is written in, there would have been two words that God could have in his sovereignty chosen to use for poor, poor in spirit.
[time=2551] Either one, for the most part, would have worked, but watch this. There's a real interesting nuance.
[time=2558] In the Greek, the term "tokos," "tokos" and "pinesse," "tokos" and "pinesse," two words in the Greek.
[time=2567] In the Greek, "tokos" comes from the verb "toso," and "tokos" means to "cower." Watch. It means to "cower" and cringe like a beggar.
[time=2574] It has the idea of shrinking from something or someone. It carries the classic idea of begging out of shame.
[time=2581] It's not talking about a con man here. You're not talking about somebody who's figured out how to get wealthy by falsely with pretense being identified as a beggar.
[time=2592] No, you're talking about a real, cowering, cringing, shrinking person shamed to have to beg, but having no choice.
[time=2601] Classic Greek describes this "tokos" as one who is reduced to beggary, who crouches unwilling to even lift his or her eyes, pleading alms and moving about in wretched conditions.
[time=2615] It says one lexicon. It's a beggar. Somebody with no wealth, no influence, no position, no honor, no respect.
[time=2624] In some cases possessing nothing at all, but the ragged clothes they wear, a real, spiritually bankrupt beggar.
[time=2633] Now, I realize this might seem a bit detailed, but wait till you see this. There's another word.
[time=2638] Panace. Jews in 2 Corinthians 9, 9, and it's a different kind of poverty, and the Greek makes this distinction.
[time=2647] Panace is a poverty that demands diligent, daily labor to earn a living.
[time=2652] It's somebody who doesn't have a stockpile, doesn't have a savings account, has to work.
[time=2657] This person has to work every day just to eat every day.
[time=2661] Panace is being so poor, you have to work hard every day of your life to sustain your life.
[time=2667] Tokos is being so poor and so destitute and so unskilled.
[time=2673] Your poverty is so deep and you are so unable that all you can do is beg.
[time=2680] You don't have the capability to work.
[time=2685] You don't have the skill to work. You are totally dependent on the gifts of others.
[time=2692] With Tokos, everything comes to you from an outside source.
[time=2697] You have no resources, no talent left, no skill, no craft, no trade, no nothing.
[time=2702] Which one does God use? Tokos? Panace? He uses Tokos.
[time=2710] Because he wanted to make sure that those people who would have known the difference between the two words were very clear,
[time=2716] and he would want you and I to be very, very clear.
[time=2719] That this is somebody who is willing to admit that they have absolutely nothing.
[time=2724] I don't care how talented you are, I don't care how gifted you are, he doesn't care how much you've accomplished,
[time=2730] he doesn't care how hard you've worked, we're talking about our spiritual, the most important condition before God,
[time=2736] and he says it's broken.
[time=2740] So you want to be happy?
[time=2744] You want to really, really, really be happy.
[time=2747] You want to be a citizen of heaven, you want to experience deep lasting joy?
[time=2752] Look at the Scriptures. Look what they say.
[time=2755] Listen to God's heart for this kind of spirit and this kind of attitude.
[time=2762] Isaiah 66, you can write these down, please do.
[time=2765] You can go back over them as the week goes on.
[time=2767] Isaiah 66, too, look at it.
[time=2769] For my hand made all these things, thus all these things came into being, declares the Lord,
[time=2775] talking about the greatness of God.
[time=2777] But to this one I will look, who does God look at?
[time=2783] Who is God drawn to?
[time=2785] Who is the one that God's going to pay attention to?
[time=2788] But to this one I will look to him who is what?
[time=2791] Say it out loud.
[time=2793] And contrite of spirit and who trembles, trembles, just trembles at my word.
[time=2804] Psalm 37, Psalm 51, 17.
[time=2809] Sacrifices of God or what? Sacrifices that mean something to God are a broken spirit,
[time=2816] a broken and contrite heart.
[time=2818] Oh God, you will not despise.
[time=2821] It says in Isaiah, I love this.
[time=2824] Watch the contrast in this verse.
[time=2827] It's so beautiful.
[time=2828] For thus says the high and exalted one.
[time=2831] And he is that, right my friends?
[time=2832] He is high and exalted.
[time=2834] For thus says the high and exalted one.
[time=2836] And who lives forever whose name is holy?
[time=2839] I dwell on a high and holy place.
[time=2842] Is that true about God?
[time=2843] Yes or no?
[time=2844] Absolutely true.
[time=2845] But now look, here's his heart.
[time=2847] I dwell on a high and holy place.
[time=2849] I also dwell with contrite and lowly of spirit in order to revive the spirit of the lowly
[time=2861] and to revive the heart of the contrite my friends, the reviving of the spirit of the lowly,
[time=2867] the reviving of the heart of the contrite.
[time=2871] That is happiness.
[time=2875] That's happy.
[time=2877] That's macarias.
[time=2879] That kind of posture filled by God who is drawn to that kind of spirit.
[time=2887] I want to ask Corbin and Tony if they'd come up at this point.
[time=2892] And I want to invite all of you to please stay tuned in here.
[time=2897] This is all part of the message.
[time=2900] I want to say to those of you in the room that know him.
[time=2905] I want to say to those of you in the room who have humbly bowed the knee of your heart
[time=2911] to him, you're a Christ follower.
[time=2913] And I want to remind you this morning that part of being a disciple, part of being in the kingdom of God is even though you've been redeemed.
[time=2922] Even though you've been saved, yes, once and for all.
[time=2925] Now on a daily basis, now moment by moment, my friends, don't you dare.
[time=2931] I can't dare.
[time=2933] We would never want to take that for granted.
[time=2935] We would always want to remember this posture before him.
[time=2939] I want to encourage you this week.
[time=2941] Those of you that know him and as you walk with him and as you live your life and do your thing at work and do your thing at home and do all that God's given you to do.
[time=2948] And as you experience, all that you experience, the moment you begin to think for a second that you're somebody.
[time=2956] I want to encourage you to say to yourself, you might want to write this down.
[time=2960] Who do I think I am?
[time=2962] I want you to say that to yourself.
[time=2964] In humble, appropriate respect before God and in a humble realization of who he is and who you are,
[time=2971] who do I think I am that I would begin to for a moment live in independence, bask in my accomplishments,
[time=2981] actually being to think that I'm somebody, that I'm this or that I'm that.
[time=2985] Who do I think I am?
[time=2987] Remember who you are in your natural state before him, broken, destitute, nothing unworthy.
[time=2995] He comes, he revives that spirit.
[time=2997] He makes it something worthy, all very worthy.
[time=3002] And for those of you that don't know him this morning, you're still trying to understand this thing called faith
[time=3008] and this relationship with him, I want to encourage you.
[time=3011] It begins for you with a moment in time when you're willing to humbly submit yourself to him.
[time=3018] And you may have friends, you may have those in your life who are encouraging you in that direction.
[time=3024] I'll tell you what, we want you to be happy.
[time=3027] I just want you to be happy on God's terms.
[time=3030] I don't want you happy on culture's terms.
[time=3033] And so I would encourage you to come and talk with us, to speak with that friend who you know and trust,
[time=3039] but it is the beginning, my friends.
[time=3041] Poor in spirit is the beginning of entrance into the kingdom.
[time=3046] And this poorness of spirit is a, it's a posture that you and I need to take each and every day.
[time=3051] Please, please listen to what Corbin and Tony have to say to you this morning.
[time=3057] Thanks, Kelly.
[time=3059] We wanted to give you a chance this morning to respond to this teaching on being poor in spirit.
[time=3066] And Kelly mentioned posture a lot. We're going to invite you to take a posture.
[time=3070] And what we mean by that is simply just an external action that would be symbolic of what's going on in our hearts.
[time=3077] You saw the stick figures up on the screen and over here on the stage and in your books.
[time=3084] Every week we're going to take on a different posture that will hopefully remind us of the heart of each of these beatitudes.
[time=3092] So the posture for blessed to the poor in spirit has three components.
[time=3096] The first is about head, our scripture reading for today from the book of Luke mentions, the parable Jesus tells about the Pharisee and the tax collector and the Pharisee who goes away justified at the end of the parable.
[time=3108] His posture is one where his eyes don't even look to heaven is what the book of Luke says, a posture of humility.
[time=3114] And so we took that from the book of Luke and want to use that this morning so we're going to bow our heads.
[time=3119] The second component is hands lifted together and kind of cupped like this over our heads to symbolize this idea of spiritual beggarship.
[time=3128] That we bring nothing to the table when it comes to our righteousness.
[time=3132] That that's completely bestowed on us by God.
[time=3135] And then the third component is a posture of sitting or kneeling whichever you're able to do or prefer a passive action that would remind us again that it's the work of Christ that makes us righteous.
[time=3148] And not anything that we do on our own.
[time=3151] So I'm going to invite you this morning to take this posture.
[time=3154] Either sitting or kneeling with our hands cupped above our heads and heads bowed and we're just going to recite some things together.
[time=3161] So if you would take that posture this morning and we'll say this together.
[time=3167] We'll just start by reciting the attitude and agreeing with God in its truth.
[time=3176] So would you say blessed are the poor in spirit?
[time=3179] Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[time=3181] For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=3186] And our scripture verse for this week is God be merciful to me the sinner.
[time=3192] Would you say that?
[time=3193] God be merciful to me the sinner.
