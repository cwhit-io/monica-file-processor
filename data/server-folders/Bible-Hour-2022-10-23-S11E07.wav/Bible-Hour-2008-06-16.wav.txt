[time=75] May He increase, but you stand please, and let's sing about a God who raises us,
[time=82] and saves us, and lifts us from the mighty clay to set our feet upon a rock.
[time=90] [MUSIC]
[time=99] When I think about the Lord, how He saved me, how He raised me, how He held me with the Holy Ghost,
[time=113] how He healed me to the uttermost, when I think about the Lord, how He picked me up,
[time=124] who turned me around, how He set my feet on the Holy Crown.
[time=135] And it makes me want a shout, hallelujah, thank You, Jesus, for Your worthy of all the glory,
[time=146] and all the honor, and all the praise.
[time=158] Oh, when I think about the Lord, how He saved me, how He raised me, how He filled me with the Holy Ghost,
[time=175] leading me to the uttermost, when I think about the Lord, how He picked me up,
[time=186] who turned me around, how He set my feet on the side of ground.
[time=196] This makes me want a shout, hallelujah, thank You, Jesus, for Your worthy of all the glory,
[time=208] and all the honor, and all the praise.
[time=214] It makes me want a shout, hallelujah, thank You, Jesus, for Your worthy of all the glory,

[time=235] Hallelujah, thank You, Jesus, for Your worthy of all the glory, and all the honor, and all the praise.

[time=277] Thee, will I cherish, thee, will I honor,
[time=302] Thou my soul's glory, joy, and crown.
[time=332] Fairest, Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature, over God, and the Son.

[time=370] thee, will I cherish, thee, will I cherish, thee, will I cherish, thee, will I cherish,

[time=612] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=617] We're so thankful that you've tuned into the Bible hour.
[time=620] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=625] And I wanna just take a moment if I can, so while welcoming those of you who may be new to the broadcast, we're thankful for you and we hope this is an encouragement to you in this next hour.
[time=638] To those of you who are a part of the Bible hour family, part of the Black Hawk family, I wanna just say thank you to so many of you.
[time=645] I met and got a chance to talk with many of you yesterday at our generous living garage sale.
[time=652] If you've been around Black Hawk at all, you know that over the last couple of years, this has become an annual event.
[time=657] And we have a garage sale.
[time=660] We invite everybody that calls Black Hawk home to bring all of their treasures and their stuff from the attic and from that one special room we all have in our house where all that stuff kinda ends up, we bring it all together and we sell it.
[time=675] The parking lot at Black Hawk is just packed.
[time=678] The North Campus gym is absolutely packed with stuff and with people, it's an amazing sight.
[time=684] I don't know what you do for your garage sale.
[time=687] I don't know how much money you make.
[time=690] I know sometimes I'll hear friends saying, "Hey, we made 300 bucks." I'll hear friends saying, "Hey, we made $600." I am so amazed and grateful to tell you that at this year's garage sale, you all, many of you helped us raise $13,000.
[time=705] And while $13,000 is significant for you and I here, again, realize the proceeds of this year's garage sale are going to the new life home orphanage in Nairobi.
[time=716] And in Nairobi, Kenya, $13,000 is almost like 80, 90, $100,000.
[time=723] And all that money is going toward the building of a brand new special needs, orphanage.
[time=729] There are some kids at the new life home, orphanage there in Nairobi who, whether it's because of mental or physical handicaps, probably won't get adopted and we're gonna help them build a place, a new home, a new facility where special needs kids are gonna be loved and cared for and educated over the years.
[time=748] And so thanks, many of you participated and we are deeply grateful for your involvement.
[time=754] I'm also looking forward to the rest of the summer here on Sunday mornings.
[time=758] Whether you keep tuning in or whether you come actually live and join us on a Sunday morning, we're teaching from Matthew 5 and we're talking about and learning about how God fundamentally wants you and I to be happy.
[time=772] That's right, he really does.
[time=773] He really wants us to be happy and deeply fulfilled.
[time=777] It's just that culture has so twisted the definition of happiness that it really is time for us to come back and look at God's definition, happiness on God's terms.
[time=788] And we'll be looking at that each and every week and till the end of August and we hope you'll come and be a part of that with us nine o'clock and 1045 on Sunday mornings.
[time=798] Hey, thank you again for your help with the garage sale.
[time=800] It was an enormous success and something that we believe brought great glory and honor to our God.
[time=806] And as far as Sunday mornings, we hope you'll come and be a part of that with us as we learn more and more about happiness and the way God intended you and I to live life.
[time=816] Hey, have a great week.
[time=818] We hope you come and see us soon and we're thankful for your partnership with us here at Blackoff.

[time=884] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=1026] (upbeat music) - This is the kingdom of God.
[time=1034] Things change and things that are seemingly confusing become crystal clear in the beatitudes.
[time=1043] Things that seem like they wouldn't cause us to be happy do.
[time=1048] That's what Kelly talked about last week and what we're gonna continue to talk about through the rest of the summer, about being blessed in God and being happy in God.
[time=1058] Last week I took you through a prayer posture.
[time=1060] One physical expression that we chose to kind of communicate the heart behind being poor in spirit.
[time=1068] And I'm gonna do that again today with blessed are those who mourn and we're gonna do it all summer long, hoping that by the end of the summer we can move through all nine beatitudes and all nine postures and all nine scripture verses together that we've been memorizing.
[time=1080] How's your memory verse going?
[time=1082] Hopefully last week is a pretty easy one, a pretty short one.
[time=1086] Let me teach you the new posture today and then we'll go through the old posture and the new posture together reciting both the beatitude and the memory verse.
[time=1093] So the new posture today is really similar to last weeks.
[time=1097] The two beatitudes kind of flow really well into the other one.
[time=1101] A posture of sitting or kneeling but this time with hands cupped over the face to symbolize mourning.
[time=1107] And so let's just do that together.
[time=1111] Cut their hands over your face and let's just say blessed are those who mourn?
[time=1115] For they shall be comforted.
[time=1118] Good, let's take the posture of cupped hands for poor in spirit and repeat after me.
[time=1125] Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[time=1130] For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1135] God be merciful to me.
[time=1139] A sinner.
[time=1141] And now the mournful posture.
[time=1143] Blessed are those who mourn.
[time=1146] For they shall be comforted.
[time=1149] And our scripture memory verse for this coming week is this repeat after me.
[time=1156] Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation
[time=1162] and leaves no regret.
[time=1170] But worldly sorrow brings death.
[time=1175] Thank you.
[time=1177] - Well, hey, as Steve makes his way to the podium this morning,
[time=1184] I want to just say how thankful I am for the opportunity to be a part of a place that allows people who have gifts to use them.
[time=1192] I always kind of said to myself as a young man just starting out in ministry, I always said if I ever get the chance to be a part of a place where I actually get to help make some decisions, one of the things that I've always, always promised myself I would do is try my best to allow those with the teaching gift, the opportunity to teach.
[time=1213] And one thing I've always felt like is I've always felt like the church sometimes.
[time=1218] Sometimes the church kind of runs the risk whenever there's just one voice.
[time=1223] Whenever there's just one guy, whenever there's just one personality, whenever there's just one style of communicating.
[time=1230] And I've just always wanted, and it's why I've been so thankful for Mitch Cruz and Steve Longbrake and others in this body who have the gift of teaching.
[time=1239] And Steve Webster has come, he and his wife Jody and their two kids, Hannah and Christian are now a part of our family here at Blackhawk, Steve's part of the Blackhawk team over on the school side of things.
[time=1251] He teaches Bible to our high school kids in just a powerful and faithful way.
[time=1255] And I'm so grateful that he's coming and I just wanna make sure that you have it set in your heart and mind.
[time=1262] We don't do other teachers to try and give you someone that you, this isn't a thing where when Steve gets done, you're supposed to walk out and go, Kyle, like Steve, or have discussions in the foyer about whether you like this guy or that guy or I like Kelly better.
[time=1277] Understand this, my friends.
[time=1279] We gotta keep reminding ourselves of this.
[time=1281] We don't do any of this.
[time=1284] Songs, teaching, drama.
[time=1288] There's nothing that we bring to you for your assessment.
[time=1291] You're not here to assess.
[time=1295] You're here to participate.
[time=1297] Amen?
[time=1299] We are to participate as the body.
[time=1302] We're doing our very best.
[time=1304] Flawed as our efforts are at times.
[time=1306] We are bringing our very best on the worship and teaching front and it's not for your assessment.
[time=1312] It's for your participation.
[time=1314] So participate this morning with a gifted teacher.
[time=1318] God has gifted Steve Webster to teach the Bible in a really powerful way.
[time=1322] We're gonna break halfway through for some worship and I just hope you'll throw your heart and your soul into his teaching, into the worship.
[time=1330] He'll come back and finish up this morning.
[time=1332] Welcome Steve Webster this morning.
[time=1334] (audience applauds)
[time=1341] Good morning.
[time=1342] Let's stand together and as we did last week, we're gonna read through the beatitudes all together.
[time=1350] Get a sense of where we've been, where we'll be today and where we're going these next few weeks together.
[time=1357] I joined Kelly in my excitement for what's going to happen.
[time=1362] Let me set up verses, the beatitudes for you by reading verses one and two.
[time=1366] And if you would join me beginning in verse three and read down through verse 12 together.
[time=1374] Seeing the crowds who went up on the mountain and when he sat down, his disciples came to him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying.
[time=1383] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1389] Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[time=1393] Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
[time=1398] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
[time=1404] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
[time=1409] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[time=1414] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
[time=1419] Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1427] Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
[time=1438] Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
[time=1448] You may be seated.
[time=1449] I invite you to sit as I pray to open our service this morning
[time=1457] and I would also invite you to assume whatever posture the Holy Spirit sees fit to lead you to pray.
[time=1463] Would you please pray with me as we begin our service this morning.
[time=1468] Most holy and merciful Father,
[time=1474] we confess to you into one another that we have sinned by our own fault in thought, word, and deed.
[time=1483] By what we have done and by what we have left undone, we have not loved you with our whole heart, mind, and strength.
[time=1491] We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
[time=1493] We've not forgiven others as we have been forgiven.
[time=1496] Lord, have mercy on us.
[time=1498] We've been deaf to your call to serve as Christ served us.
[time=1502] We've not been true to the mind of Christ.
[time=1503] We have grieved your Holy Spirit, Lord, have mercy on us.
[time=1507] We confess to you, Lord, all our past unfaithfulness, the pride, hypocrisy, and impatience of our lives.
[time=1515] We confess to you.
[time=1516] Our self-indulgent appetites and ways and our exploitation of other people, we confess.
[time=1522] Our anger at our own frustration, our envy of those more fortunate than ourselves.
[time=1526] We confess to you.
[time=1529] Our negligence and prayer and worship and our failure to commend the faith that is in us we confess to you.
[time=1536] Accept our repentance, Lord.
[time=1538] For the wrongs we've done, for our blindness to human need and suffering and our indifference to injustice and cruelty.
[time=1545] Accept our repentance, Father, for all false judgments, for uncharitable thoughts to our neighbors, for our prejudice and contempt toward those who differ from us, Lord, please accept our repentance.
[time=1556] Restore us, good Lord, and let your anger depart from us favorably hear us, so your mercy is great.
[time=1562] Accomplish in us the work of your salvation that we may show forth your glory in the world, but the cross and passion of your son, our Lord, bring us to the joy of his resurrection.
[time=1573] Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, you desire not the death of sinners God, but they would turn from their wickedness and live.
[time=1582] You pardon those who truly repent and with sincere hearts believe your gospel.
[time=1587] We beseech you, Father, we beseech you.
[time=1590] We beg you to grant us to repentance by your Holy Spirit, that those things that would please you are done on this day, that the rest of our lives hereafter may be pure and holy, and that at the last may come to your eternal joy through Jesus Christ, our Lord, teach us to mourn, Father, and beyond our mourning, give us comfort.
[time=1612] I pray with my dear friends this morning in Jesus' name.
[time=1615] [AMEN] Happiness.
[time=1620] Oh boy, happiness.
[time=1624] Would you please imagine in your notes in your bulletin this morning that those underlined words are not there?
[time=1630] So use your imagination to fill them in as we go today, and I'll invite you to do that to participate in that sort of imagination today.
[time=1637] Happiness is the great question confronting mankind.
[time=1643] The whole world is longing for happiness.
[time=1646] It is tragic to observe the ways in which people are seeking it.
[time=1650] The vast majority, alas, are doing so in a way that is bound to produce misery.
[time=1657] Anything which by evading the difficulties really makes people happy for the time being for the time being is ultimately going to add to their misery and problems.
[time=1667] That is where the utter deceitfulness of sin comes in.
[time=1671] It is always offering happiness, and it always leads to unhappiness, and to final misery and wretchedness.
[time=1680] The Sermon on the Mount says, however, if you want to be truly happy, here's the way.
[time=1685] This and this alone is the type of person who is truly happy, who was really blessed.
[time=1692] This is the sort of person who is to be congratulated.
[time=1697] Let me review with you a little bit of where we were last week, and define some terms for you as we proceed.
[time=1703] Corbin mentioned, and he is exactly right, that the attitudes flow very nicely into one another.
[time=1710] The poor in spirit necessarily brings us to mourn.
[time=1714] And so I've seen that just even just recently, and it's revolutionized the way I'm reading this, but let me define some terms for you about being happy in your notes.
[time=1722] To be happy is the blissful and contented condition of the redeemed soul.
[time=1728] These beatitudes are for the redeemed.
[time=1730] They are not for anyone else.
[time=1732] I must say, the beatitudes are called to repentance,
[time=1738] and through repentance to be saved.
[time=1741] If you hear this morning, if you are not a saved person, if you don't know Christ, this is a call for you to turn to him, to repent and to know him.
[time=1752] It's a call for that.
[time=1753] The word macarias doesn't refer to somebody who has received blessing from God, but refers to somebody whose position is to be envied.
[time=1762] Somebody used to be congratulated.
[time=1764] I spent this last week with a good friend in Wheaton at a conference, and I heard all kinds of wonderful accents, British accents and Scottish accents and Irish accents and Australian accents, and my own voice is very unsatisfactory.
[time=1778] I feel very disappointed at the sound of my own voice, my lack of some kind of color to my voice.
[time=1783] Anyway, high of 75, not a cloud in the sky, this beautiful place and these people unpacking these wonderful truths from the word macarias.
[time=1794] Happy.
[time=1796] A person whose place is to be envied.
[time=1799] That's where I was last week.
[time=1800] I had the opportunity to go and I'm so thankful for it.
[time=1803] I ask you two questions.
[time=1807] Please listen carefully to the questions.
[time=1808] We'd like you to respond if you wouldn't mind.
[time=1811] Have you ever chased something down, some kind of behavior or attitude or condition that you thought would bring you happiness that you knew was wrong?
[time=1822] You ever done that before?
[time=1824] Lord knows I have.
[time=1825] Many of you have done the same thing.
[time=1827] Second question, did it work?
[time=1829] Did it work?
[time=1834] No, it didn't work.
[time=1835] It can't.
[time=1836] It cannot, why do we do that?
[time=1839] Would you please listen with me to Thomas Watson?
[time=1844] I could not say it like this and so I will give him the credit.
[time=1848] Thomas Watson, those things which are not comparable to the desires of the soul can never make a man blessed.
[time=1855] Happy, temporary things are not commensurate.
[time=1858] They're not the same to the desires of the soul.
[time=1862] Therefore they can't make him blessed.
[time=1864] Nothing on earth can satisfy.
[time=1866] Would you write that down somewhere in your notes?
[time=1869] I know that you think it but I hope that we believe it this morning.
[time=1871] Nothing on earth.
[time=1873] You guys are embarrassed to really write that down.
[time=1876] Nothing on earth can satisfy.
[time=1877] He that loves silver will not be satisfied
[time=1884] with silver from Ecclesiastes 5.
[time=1887] Riches are unsatisfying for two reasons.
[time=1890] Number one, they're not real.
[time=1892] Isn't that interesting?
[time=1895] They're not real.
[time=1896] The world's called a fashion in 1 Corinthians chapter seven.
[time=1900] That word in Greek is for a mathematical figure but sometimes a show or an apparition.
[time=1906] Riches are but tinned over, he says.
[time=1911] They're like alchemy which glisters a little in our eyes and at death all the alchemy is worn off.
[time=1918] Listen to this.
[time=1919] Riches are but sugared lies.
[time=1923] Pleasant impostures like a gilded cover which has not one leaf of true comfort bound up in it because they are not suitable.
[time=1935] Number two, not real, not suitable.
[time=1938] The soul is a spiritual thing.
[time=1939] Riches are an earthly thing.
[time=1941] How can these things fill a spiritual substance?
[time=1944] They can't.
[time=1945] You may as well fill your treasure chest with grace as your heart with gold.
[time=1950] If a man were crowned with all the delights of the world, if God should build him a house among the stars, yet the restless eye of his unsatisfied mind would be looking ever higher.
[time=1962] Well, this will make me happy and this will make me happy and this will make me happy and it's always one more thing, isn't it?
[time=1967] Maybe if I achieve this station in life, I'll be happy.
[time=1971] We get there to quote Ravi Zacharias, if I might.
[time=1976] The loneliest moment in life is when you just experience what you thought would give you the ultimate and you're let down, the loneliest moment in life.
[time=1985] Looking still higher, he'd be prying beyond the heavens for some hidden rarities which he thinks he had not yet attained to.
[time=1994] So unquenchable is the thirst of the soul till it come to bathe in the river of life and to center upon true blessedness.
[time=2002] Thomas Watson.
[time=2003] Oscar Wilde is famous author and probably the most debauched man ever to live in England.
[time=2010] He purposed in his life to deny himself no pleasure, nothing in the garden of delights he said no to.
[time=2017] He made it his purpose in life to never say no to anything that he wanted to do and in the end, all he found was misery.
[time=2027] In some mean hotel in Paris, France, wasting away withering like a flower.
[time=2034] A wasted life.
[time=2040] By way of review to be happy is that blissful
[time=2046] and contented condition of your soul, of the redeemed soul.
[time=2049] That's happiness.
[time=2050] I saw a commercial last night for this chocolate called bliss.
[time=2054] Have you seen that commercial?
[time=2056] It made my skin crawl.
[time=2058] It was pretty horrific.
[time=2061] This woman is singing very beautifully in the background about truth and destiny and a piece of chocolate.
[time=2067] I'm serious.
[time=2069] If you see it, you'll listen to her voice.
[time=2071] Truth and destiny in a piece of chocolate called bliss.
[time=2074] I was ashamed to even be watching that commercial.
[time=2080] Straight faced bliss in a piece of chocolate?
[time=2084] What?
[time=2087] To be poor in spirit, Kelly mentioned last week very beautifully is to rightly understand our spiritual poverty and bankruptcy.
[time=2094] My hands are outstretched before God in that posture of prayer with nothing in them.
[time=2099] Whatever you have in your hands this morning, guys, that you're giving to God to be impressive, take it out, please.
[time=2104] He is not impressed.
[time=2106] I spent last week at Wheaton College in the company of these brilliant minds, small of the world, trying to be impressive.
[time=2112] Well, you know, I do this and, well, you know, I've done that.
[time=2117] I can't imagine how absurd I look, trying to be impressive with these brilliant minds in the table full of their books and their resources.
[time=2124] I was just trying to be impressive and I'm sure I looked pretty pathetic.
[time=2129] To be poor in spirit, that word "poor" is the word "tokos."
[time=2136] And it means, as Kelly mentioned, not being economically disadvantaged but being spiritually unworthy.
[time=2144] The only other place it's used in New Testament in that sense is the church at Laodicea in Revelation chapter three.
[time=2149] It'll be in the screens before you.
[time=2152] Listen, please.
[time=2153] To the angel of the church at Laodicea, right.
[time=2156] These are familiar things that we read this verse before.
[time=2159] The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation, Jesus.
[time=2164] I know your works, you're neither cold nor hot, whether you were either cold or hot.
[time=2170] So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, that will spit you out of my mouth.
[time=2175] For you say, I am rich, I have prospered and I need nothing.
[time=2182] Not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, tokos, blind and naked.
[time=2191] Down to verse 19.
[time=2194] Notice the call through repentance.
[time=2197] Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline.
[time=2201] So bezealous and repent.
[time=2204] Repent.
[time=2205] Be poor in spirits who rightly grasp our spiritual poverty and bankruptcy.
[time=2210] And lastly, by way of review, those hands outstretched before God are not really empty.
[time=2214] In those hands before Him is a wealth, as your notes say, of wickedness.
[time=2220] All I offer to God in my unworthiness is wickedness.
[time=2223] That's who I am before Him.
[time=2225] And that's where we are to go this morning.
[time=2227] I hope that bothers you.
[time=2228] I hope the prayer that we pray this morning from the Book of Common Prayer.
[time=2233] I hope you were bothered by that prayer.
[time=2234] You found yourself somewhere in there.
[time=2236] You're convicted.
[time=2237] I'm in that prayer.
[time=2240] I have not loved Him with my whole heart, friends.
[time=2242] I have not.
[time=2243] I have envied those more fortunate than myself.
[time=2246] I have done that.
[time=2247] I am that person and in my hands out just before Him, they're not really empty, they're full with wickedness.
[time=2254] Listen to what Paul says in Ephesians chapter two.
[time=2257] And you were dead, in your trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of the world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit which is at work and the sons of disobedience, among whom we all once lived in the passions of our minds, of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind and were by nature, children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
[time=2279] Down to verse 11 of Ephesians two, same passage.
[time=2282] Therefore remember that at one time, you Gentiles in the flesh called the uncircumcision made flesh by hands, remember the Bible's call to remember.
[time=2292] I hope that we do a good job of that, of remembering.
[time=2296] Do you remember?
[time=2297] Stephen Chris Chaben knows something about mourning, doesn't he?
[time=2300] You've heard about what happened to him as little girl run over and is drivewayed by his son.
[time=2306] Cannot imagine.
[time=2307] You wrote a song years ago called Remember Your Chains.
[time=2312] Remember your chains are gone.
[time=2318] Remember your chains.
[time=2319] Remember that you were at one time separate from Christ, alienated from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers, the covenant of promise, having no hope without God in the world.
[time=2329] That's where I am outside of Christ.
[time=2330] That's what's in my hands.
[time=2332] No hope without God, I'm a stranger to him.
[time=2337] The kingdom of heaven is the next part of that beatitude.
[time=2342] Blessed the foreign spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2345] Do you listen to the words of that song that Corbin and Tonya just sang?
[time=2349] This is the kingdom.
[time=2352] When you come, everything changes.
[time=2354] What a beautiful song.
[time=2355] The kingdom of heaven belongs to the foreign spirit.
[time=2359] It's been given.
[time=2360] There is, is, right now, kingdom of heaven.
[time=2364] In Matthew 13, Jesus says that it belongs to children.
[time=2367] I have small children.
[time=2370] Hannah's five and Christian's 18 months.
[time=2373] And they are totally dependent upon us.
[time=2375] Imagine leaving a room of five-year-olds alone for even an hour's time.
[time=2381] What would happen?
[time=2383] It'd be a great little demonstration of total depravity, leaving five-year-olds alone in a room for an hour.
[time=2389] See what happens.
[time=2390] How many limbs they get torn off in a five and an hour of being by themselves.
[time=2394] Kids are totally dependent upon other stick care of them, little children.
[time=2398] And those who have nothing in their hands, I cannot do it myself.
[time=2404] So as I read this, beatitude, Matthew five, verse four, in preparation for now, we're moving on to our beatitude for today.
[time=2413] Blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted to ask myself two questions.
[time=2416] The first one is in your notes.
[time=2417] They're both are actually.
[time=2418] What does it mean to mourn?
[time=2419] It's a good question.
[time=2421] The word for mourn is pentheo in the Greek.
[time=2425] It means to experience, and if you write this down somewhere next to that question, I think it'd be helpful to you.
[time=2430] It means to experience sadness as the result of a condition.
[time=2434] That's what it means to mourn.
[time=2437] To experience sadness as the result of a condition.
[time=2441] To mourn in the Bible, it is used to mean somebody who has lost someone.
[time=2446] When you see the word mourn on the page, maybe you think that you mourn a loved one who has passed on.
[time=2450] It does mean that.
[time=2451] It can mean that.
[time=2452] But mourn in Matthew five, verse four is much more than that.
[time=2458] It's an understanding of where I am before him.
[time=2462] Do you see how poor in spirit bleeds into mourning?
[time=2465] How it's so, it's very much related.
[time=2467] I am poor in spirit.
[time=2469] I have nothing before him.
[time=2470] I am destitute.
[time=2471] I am wretched, blind, and naked.
[time=2473] And that should cause us to mourn.
[time=2476] It should cause us to go, woo hoo, all right.
[time=2479] That's not the proper response.
[time=2481] This is the proper response before him.
[time=2486] In Ephesians, rather than 1 Corinthians chapter five, there's people involved in sexual sin, very grievous sexual sin, and they're arrogant.
[time=2495] They don't even care, this kind of strut around saying, what's the big deal, Paul says you should be mourning.
[time=2500] You should mourn.
[time=2502] You are arrogant, you ought to mourn.
[time=2504] It's the proper response to our sin, our condition.
[time=2507] In Luke's Beatitudes and James chapter four, we're called to be wretched.
[time=2511] Where are those, he says in Luke six, who are happy now, who are flippant now, who are happy, go lucky now.
[time=2519] It's no, none of that.
[time=2521] John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.
[time=2524] I keep, I recommend music to you guys, and now it's books to you, I guess.
[time=2528] Maybe I've ever heard of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.
[time=2531] Raise your hand, please.
[time=2532] If you heard of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, many of you, the most read book in the English language beyond the Bible is Pilgrim's Progress.
[time=2540] We had a lot in the car and the way home from our conference last week, and we only got through about an hour and a half of it.
[time=2544] We couldn't listen anymore.
[time=2546] It was so overwhelming, so convicting.
[time=2549] May I read for you a little bit of the first two paragraphs of the book.
[time=2553] It's incredibly appropriate.
[time=2556] Dare I say wildly appropriate.
[time=2557] As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I came to a certain place where there was a den, a jail.
[time=2565] I laid down in that place to sleep, and as I slept, I dreamed a dream.
[time=2568] I dreamed and behold, I saw a man clothe with rags, since standing in a certain place with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden on his back.
[time=2578] I looked and saw him open the book and read there, and as he read, he wept and trembled, and not being able to contain himself.
[time=2588] He broke out with a loom, the mentable cry, saying, "What shall I do?" In this plight, therefore, he went home and restrained himself as long as he could that his wife and children shouldn't perceive his distress, but he could not be silent because his trouble increased.
[time=2603] So at length, he disclosed his mind to his wife and children, and he began to talk to them, "Oh, my dear wife," he said, "and you the children, you my children, "I, your dear friend, and in myself undone." By reason of a burden that lies hard upon me, I am certainly informed that this city will come to ruin.
[time=2626] He goes off on his quest.
[time=2631] He can't sleep.
[time=2632] He's in misery day and night until he goes in his quest, and his burden is removed as he walks through that gate.
[time=2639] Beautiful story.
[time=2639] Please read it this week.
[time=2640] You can find it online free of charge.
[time=2642] Morning.
[time=2647] In Romans 8, Jesus described as the firstborn of many brothers.
[time=2650] He, we are to call ourselves Christians, to call ourselves little christs, to be like him.
[time=2657] The firstborn among many brothers.
[time=2659] So what is Jesus like?
[time=2660] In that famous prophecy in Isaiah 53, he described as the man of sorrows, quainted with grief.
[time=2668] And G.K. Cheshireson's book, Orthodoxy, at the very end of the book, it's way too big for me to digest, but the very, very end, he says, that something about Jesus was hidden from us when he was on the earth.
[time=2681] And he is sometimes fancy that it was his mirth.
[time=2684] Do you know what mirth is?
[time=2687] It means happiness or laughter.
[time=2690] That we never see Jesus laughing in the gospels, probably 'cause we couldn't handle it, it'd be too much for us.
[time=2694] But we see him crying, don't we?
[time=2697] Often.
[time=2698] Crying over Jerusalem, crying over Lazarus, as friend has experienced the world's brokenness.
[time=2705] Morning.
[time=2707] Man of sorrow is a queen with grief.
[time=2709] To mourn is to be aware of my condition.
[time=2712] Let her A in your notes.
[time=2714] To mourn is to understand the great horror of sin.
[time=2718] Michael Wilkins, commentary, describes being on a combat patrol in Vietnam, and especially bloody battle has taken place.
[time=2723] And his friends lie on the ground broken, bloodied, dead.
[time=2728] He then, that day, describes he's killed young men without conscience, and he's underneath a blanket of stars and he says, what have I done?
[time=2740] And that night he experiences brokenness.
[time=2742] I read here, I had killed gleefully that day.
[time=2747] I'd ripped the life of other young men without a twinge of conscience.
[time=2751] So the bodies of my eight, 19 and 20 year old squad members ravaged by other young men who were our hated enemies, yet probably none of us knew why.
[time=2759] Then that I experienced brokenness.
[time=2763] I became poor in spirit as I recognized the depth of my depravity and shuttered as I recognized as I realized the possibility of my fate before God if he existed.
[time=2772] Remarkable.
[time=2773] Psalm 119 verse 136 speaks to this.
[time=2776] My eyes shed streams of tears because people do not keep your law.
[time=2781] That's a sense of mourning as well.
[time=2783] It is my own sin, but it's also our own brokenness and a broken families and broken marriages all around us.
[time=2790] Morning.
[time=2791] To mourn is to come to grips with the horror of sin.
[time=2796] It's also to express the second point in your notes there.
[time=2799] There are some verses here to give you folks and there's a lot more that I can get to this morning but I invite you to read this week not only in your study guides but also some of the verses in your notes this morning.
[time=2808] To mourn is to express the intense sense as Robert Gulick of loss, helplessness and despair.
[time=2814] An intense sense of what that is.
[time=2820] Godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret but worldly grief produces death.
[time=2828] Second Corinthians chapter seven.
[time=2829] So verse of this week, you can't have one without the other.
[time=2832] Here we are.
[time=2835] Here is our position.
[time=2836] Godly grief leads to repentance which leads to salvation.
[time=2842] There is an unbroken line, friends.
[time=2844] If we have no godly grief, then we have no repentance.
[time=2848] If we have no repentance, we have no salvation.
[time=2852] Are you in that place this morning?
[time=2854] Morning.
[time=2857] Gregory of Nises said it's impossible for one to live without tears who considers things exactly as they are.
[time=2864] Have you, are you in that place?
[time=2867] You mourn your own brokenness.
[time=2869] You mourn your own, your community's brokenness, your family's brokenness.
[time=2874] That's the road to repentance, friends.
[time=2876] If you have no needs, you'll never cry out for your needs to be met.
[time=2880] You understand that and so do I.
[time=2883] Why is the gospel flourishing in the third world?
[time=2885] Because a river of sewage runs through their front yard.
[time=2889] Their front yard, you'll pardon me.
[time=2891] It runs by them, wherever they are.
[time=2895] Some friends of ours that we met this past week talk about Americans living in their little subub and idles.
[time=2902] As I said in their beautiful accent.
[time=2906] A suburban idyll is a idyllic place.
[time=2909] The idyll is the non-form of that word idyllic which means perfect.
[time=2913] You live in these places, she described this.
[time=2915] They live in the inner city of London and you have to drive 45 minutes to see grass from their house.
[time=2920] And we Americans, we have so much need.
[time=2925] What need do I have?
[time=2926] Do you get my grass fertilized again?
[time=2932] It's my need.
[time=2932] To mourn is to experience, lastly, an intense sense of loss, help us to send despair again.
[time=2941] Robert Gillick says that.
[time=2942] A wretched man that I am.
[time=2944] Who will deliver me from this body of death?
[time=2946] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=3009] Let's sing these words from Psalm 24.
[time=3015] [MUSIC - 95 seconds]
[time=3115] - In Romans 7, verse 24, Paul says,
[time=3128] "Wretched man that I am." Who would deliver me from this body of death when people usually stop there in the verse?
[time=3137] And I pray we would never stop with the B'adu, with the first phrase that blessed were those who mourn and not go to the next part about comfort.
[time=3145] Listen to how Paul ends that verse in Romans 7.
[time=3147] But thanks be to God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3152] Who will save me from this body of death, the Lord Jesus Christ?
[time=3157] Amen, indeed.
[time=3160] We talked about what it means to be happy, what it means to be poor in spirit, what it means to mourn.
[time=3165] Let me end this morning with you about what it means to be comforted.
[time=3169] From Isaiah chapter 40, verses one and two, to be comforted is to understand the disciples sins are forgiven.
[time=3178] The word for comfort here is para callejo, which is also shows up with the Holy Spirit called the helper or comforter in the New Testament.
[time=3187] And if you write this in your notes about what it means to be comforted quickly, it means to be to instill someone with courage.
[time=3196] When people share with me after I speak in front of others
[time=3202] and they say thank you, I say most of the time, I hope you are encouraged.
[time=3206] I see that as my responsibility to comfort you.
[time=3210] In 1st Thessalonians 5, Paul is describing the return of Christ and he says comfort each other with these words.
[time=3218] Hope these words have been comforting to you this morning in the right way.
[time=3222] But let's read Isaiah 40 together.
[time=3224] Comfort, comfort, my people says your God.
[time=3228] Speak tenderly to Jerusalem and cry to her that her warfare has ended.
[time=3232] Her iniquity is pardoned that she has received from the Lord's hand double for all her sins.
[time=3240] Let's go to Isaiah 61.
[time=3244] This passage is all over Matthew 5.
[time=3248] You'll see it here.
[time=3249] The spirit of the Lord God is upon me.
[time=3252] Jesus quotes these words of Himself in Luke's Gospel.
[time=3255] Because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor, to the poor.
[time=3261] He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives, the opening of the prison to those who are bound to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all who mourn, to comfort all who mourn.
[time=3278] Be comfortless to know your sins are forgiven.
[time=3280] Be comforted, secondly, is to experience the joy that only comes through suffering.
[time=3285] Only comes through suffering.
[time=3288] Dietrich Bonhoeffer, murdered as a disciple of Christ by the Nazis.
[time=3295] Said this, "The disciples bear the suffering late on them, only by the power of Him who bears all suffering on the cross.
[time=3301] As bears of suffering, they stand in communion with the crucified.
[time=3305] They stand as strangers in the power of Him who is so alien to the world that it crucified Him.
[time=3311] This is their comfort.
[time=3313] Or rather, He is their comfort, their comforter.
[time=3317] This alien community is comforted by the cross.
[time=3321] Only through suffering do we experience joy in John 16.
[time=3327] Jesus describes the pain of childbirth and the joy at the end.
[time=3335] Lastly, to be comforted is to be committed of sin, guided in truth and convinced of the Lord's ultimate victory over death and all evil.
[time=3347] As we conclude this morning, if I could ask you to stand and I wanna read with you Revelation 21 as our benediction.
[time=3364] The happiness, the blissful condition of the redeemed soul, poor in spirit, empty hands aware of my own poverty, to mourn, to rightly understand my condition, to rightly understand it and to respond appropriately, to be comforted, to be instilled with courage.
[time=3386] I comfort you with these words.
[time=3390] Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[time=3395] The first heaven and the first earth had passed away to see was no more.
[time=3398] And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride, adorned for her husband.
[time=3407] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.
[time=3414] He will dwell with them and they will be His people and God Himself will be with them as their God.
[time=3420] He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[time=3424] Death shall be no more.
[time=3426] May I shall be mourning or crying or pain anymore
[time=3434] for the former things have passed away." Lord, as we leave this morning in Your grace, I pray that we would be the people that Your Son describes to us in Your Word.
[time=3449] Your servant Paul, Lord, begs us to be reconciled to You.
[time=3455] Lord, may we first be reconciled to You
[time=3461] and after that be reconciled to our brother as Your son, Jesus, implores us.
[time=3466] Dismiss us now, God, with Your comfort.
[time=3468] Having mourned our sin, mourned the world's brokenness.
[time=3472] Lord, we leave this place now, comforted by Your Holy Spirit, that You will one day wipe every tear from our eyes.
[time=3479] And in that, we agree together and say, amen.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
