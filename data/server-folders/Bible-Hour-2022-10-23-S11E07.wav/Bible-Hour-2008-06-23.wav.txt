[time=0] I'm assuming every person in this room really likes the idea of deep blissful
[time=6] enjoyment, deep lasting satisfaction. I'm assuming everybody in the room is
[time=12] really okay with the idea of really being truly significantly happy.
[time=30] Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour. My name is Kelly Bird and I
[time=52] have the privilege of serving here at Blackhawk as the senior pastor and we're so thankful to have you with us today and grateful for this series that we find ourselves in the midst of in recent weeks here at Blackhawk. The series title is God wants you happy and and I want you to think about that. Many of you have been tracking along with us. Others of you may be joining in for the first time today but I want to just say that to you one more time and I want to ask you a question this morning before you hear the message. God wants you happy. The
[time=84] Bible is clear about that. Now happy is a word that we've defined differently as
[time=90] the years and generations have gone by as culture and society have spoken into
[time=96] that concept. You and I understand that happy has been kind of redefined to mean
[time=102] pleasure. Happy has been redefined to mean wealth. Happy has been redefined to
[time=109] mean power and authority and luxury and God's definition of happy is so much
[time=115] different and that's what we're learning but nonetheless God wants you happy. He wants you happy on his terms. He wants you and your soul deep deeply
[time=127] blissful the scriptures say. I mean he wants every part of you absolutely and fully content thrilled at peace filled with joy and I want to ask you this morning are you are you happy are you really truly like deep down in your soul
[time=146] happy because God's word says the only place you'll ever find that is in relationship with his son. I know like many of you that there are so many
[time=157] opportunities out there calling at us inviting us to pursue happiness in all kinds of avenues through all kinds of means and I want to just remind you this morning that here in Matthew 5 and these first eleven twelve verses God gives us
[time=172] his design for true happiness and it will sound as you listen and as you've been listening these last couple of weeks and as you listen throughout the entire summer here on the Bible Hour it will sound completely antithetical it
[time=186] will sound completely counterintuitive but the fact of the matter is what we're looking at these days in Matthew 5 is God's design for true happiness and I hope I hope you'll listen I hope you'll open your heart today and allow God to speak into it instead of the culture and society speaking in to this definition of what it means to be truly happy we're glad you joined us we're thankful you've tuned in and I hope for each and every one of you watching right now I hope for every one of you God's happiness in your heart and soul God bless you come by and see you soon sometime we'd love to meet you have a great great week I wanted to teach you that refrain today I think it's just full of really beautiful lyrics that communicate who our God is we sang that
[time=232] he's king forever living Savior redeemer Lord of heaven robed in majesty
[time=241] crowned in glory God Almighty forever Lord ever living God truth about
[time=252] who our God is truth about his character and this morning as we move into the
[time=258] next beatitude blessed are the gentle for they shall inherit the earth it's so
[time=264] important to have a right understanding of the character of God gentleness is defined like this the Greek term prious was used to describe a
[time=277] soothing medicine or a soft breeze gentleness was used to describe animals
[time=285] that were wild and then tamed in order to be useful it's a picture of gentleness and for our human heart attitudes gentleness means being gentle of spirit
[time=295] being meek submissive quiet and tender-hearted it's a picture of humility
[time=302] ultimately and this author contrasts the difference between poor in spirit which
[time=309] was also a hard attitude of humility and gentleness another hard attitude of humility the difference he says is that poor in spirit is our response to our
[time=321] own sinfulness when we take inventory of our sin we're humbled by our sinfulness
[time=330] and it ensues poor in spirit but gentleness is a little bit different it's
[time=337] humility in response to God's holiness when we inventory God's greatness and God's character in God's holiness it humbles us because we know that he is
[time=348] those things so they both have are similar in that their humility or humble
[time=355] traits that were to take but they're just a little bit different because that first one is in response to our sinfulness and this one gentleness is in response to the holiness of God so the posture we're going to take today you'll see over there on the pillar is one that still seated as a passive action with a hand over the heart to just communicate that our hearts are going to be gentle in whatever we face but then the other arm is held toward heaven with a fist
[time=382] showing the might not that's our own but the might of God in his power and so gentleness is our response to God's character if you would take this posture
[time=393] and I'm going to lead us in a time of prayer I'll communicate the line of prayer and then you respond with what I say God you are holy and I am not God you are
[time=413] perfect and I am not you are righteous and I am not
[time=422] father you are all knowing and I am not
[time=429] all powerful and I am not
[time=435] ever present and I am not
[time=443] all good and I am not all in all and I am not
[time=451] God you are the creator of the universe and I am not
[time=459] God you are the author of my life and I am not
[time=473] you create in me a clean heart and I do not
[time=479] God you are redeemer and savior and I am not
[time=486] love mercy and grace and I am not
[time=500] the rock of my salvation and I am not the author and perfecter of my faith and I am not
[time=512] you are the same yesterday today and forever and I am not
[time=528] you are infinite and I am not holy and I am not
[time=535] holy and I am not holy and I am not
[time=546] amen this morning let's review the postures that we've taken over the last couple of weeks
[time=558] and we'll take each posture and say the beatitude that goes with each one let's start with poor in spirit blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven

[time=983] hey if you're here this morning uh and you got your bible would you open it up to Matthew
[time=994] chapter five i want to have us jump back into our study of the beatitudes i want to review for a
[time=1000] moment here where we've been so far in our study of true happiness we've entitled the series
[time=1006] god wants you happy and i want to just uh i want to just ask this question before we go any further
[time=1013] because i'm assuming this but it's never good to assume i'm assuming and i asked this a few weeks
[time=1019] ago and there was a a wide you know just an absolutely a majority of people in the room were
[time=1025] with me on this but i want to just make sure nothing's changed i'm assuming all of you want to be happy
[time=1033] i'm assuming every person in this room really likes the idea of deep blissful enjoyment deep
[time=1040] lasting satisfaction i'm assuming everybody in the room is really okay with the idea
[time=1046] of really being truly significantly happy anybody in the room not interested in that
[time=1054] okay good we're still on the same page and uh where we've been so far is that we've seen god
[time=1063] wants you by virtue of what he says here at the beginning of the sermon on the mountain Matthew five god wants you blissfully happy mccarias is the word that he uses there again and again and again
[time=1075] and again and again in those first 11 verses blessed are the blessed are the blessed are that word is
[time=1082] happy deeply content a level of contentment that reaches into the depths of your soul is what that
[time=1090] word means god wants you blissfully happy god designed you to be at the heart and soul level deeply joyful we saw in week one that this happiness this contentedness of the soul begins when you are
[time=1103] tokas many of you wrote that down a few weeks ago tokas poor in spirit is where this begins the honest
[time=1111] and clear realization the admission that in your humanness you have nothing to offer god that's where
[time=1118] all of this began blessed are the poor in spirit we saw that happiness we saw that entrance into
[time=1125] the kingdom we saw that that that participation in the kingdom begins with a spiritual brokenness
[time=1132] poor in spirit pure unadulterated humility we saw in week two how that sense of spiritual poverty
[time=1143] and moral bankruptcy before god should lead you and i to mourn our sinfulness before god
[time=1150] should lead you and i to a godly sorrow a brokenness the realization of how destitute we are the
[time=1158] realization of how broken we are the realization of how depraved in our humanity we really are
[time=1166] steve webster showed us just last week that that leads you and i or should lead you and i to a
[time=1172] morning a godly sorrow which then allows us to receive comfort which is the only way the only way
[time=1182] for you and i to ever be what happy what a great beginning now we come this morning to matthew five
[time=1190] five to matthew five five and our third posture our third principle regarding true happiness
[time=1199] a gentle meek soft-hearted spirit a meek and humble posture before god can i just read matthew five
[time=1208] one to five kind of where we've been so far would you in honor of god's word stand and just allow me to read this for you as we begin our time this morning if you remember back we started
[time=1219] there in matthew five one it says when jesus saw the crowds he went up on the mountain
[time=1225] again we just briefly we noted that this was oftentimes a way that the rabbi or the communicator
[time=1231] or teacher would speak in that day the top of a mountain and toward the top he would stand
[time=1237] and all the way down that mountainside and all the way through the ravine and all the way up the other side of the hill thousands of people scholars would say fifteen to twenty thousand
[time=1247] listened to him on this day when jesus saw the crowds he went up on the mountain and after he
[time=1254] sat down his disciples came to him goes on in verse two to say he opened his mouth and began to
[time=1260] teach them remember the disciples we talked about how this message of matthew five six and seven
[time=1267] the sermon on the mount is for the disciples he spoke to them this is about kingdom stuff my friends this message is for those who are redeemed this was for the disciples and yet thousands and
[time=1279] thousands of others got to what they got to listen in and he opened his mouth and began to teach them
[time=1286] saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are those who mourn
[time=1294] for they shall be comforted and now here today in verse five blessed are the gentle or the meek
[time=1302] for they shall inherit the earth pray with me would you father god we stand this morning
[time=1309] hoping god and asking again for your intervention in this time here god we pray that our hearts and
[time=1318] our souls and our minds and our lives god every part of who we are god wouldn't be laid bare
[time=1327] before you this morning god that your word and your spirit would have their way with every part of who we are where there needs to be change oh god we pray that you bring it so many in the room
[time=1338] this morning god are familiar with these truths and others god are here and for the very first time
[time=1346] learning what it means to be in relationship with you learning what it means to truly be happy not learning what it means to be a citizen of heaven a citizen of the kingdom and so god whether it's review or new truth i pray god that you would work and move in a powerful way and
[time=1363] we'll thank you for that in your son's name we pray amen you can be seated what i want to do is share
[time=1371] with you i want to do three things this morning if i could have if i could just share with you some i think very pertinent and very significant thoughts about what it means or why it was so
[time=1381] important that jesus says to this hillside and valley and ravine and with thousands of people
[time=1388] why it was so important that he talked about being meek i want to just share with you some general thoughts about this be attitude i want to then give you some definition some real clear definition so you and i have something to to work with as we leave this place
[time=1404] today and head into our week and i also want to give you at the end three things three i hope very practical things to take with you that you and i can give thought and attention to so here we go blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth i had a great time over the last
[time=1420] couple of weeks just collecting information and and reading different books and going through
[time=1426] different commentaries and listening to the different teachings i've just tried to kind of
[time=1432] collect as much of that as i can hear free this morning and let me just share some of what i found this this statement blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth my friends i want you to understand that this statement by jesus like the first two blessed are the poor in spirit and
[time=1448] blessed are those who mourn to put it mildly would have been shocking for those who sat there that day
[time=1456] on that mountainside and uh and listened shocking because this statement like the first two called
[time=1462] for a heart attitude that was completely foreign to their current way of thinking they had already
[time=1468] heard him say that a broken spirit and a mourning heart were necessary to enter messiah's kingdom
[time=1474] and now jesus further jolts them he he further alters their thinking he further surprises them
[time=1481] by saying happy are the meek blessed are the gentle it's an absolutely foreign thought to
[time=1489] any jewish person in that day and i want to tell you why let me just share with you some things that
[time=1495] i found that explain to you why this would be in a predominantly jewish context remember that
[time=1501] in a predominantly jewish context why this simple phrase would have been so utterly shocking
[time=1509] so utterly disappointing so very confusing for those who listened in there on that hillside
[time=1517] for the very first time here you go a little over 50 years before jesus was born in the year 63 BC
[time=1523] palestine the jewish nation if you will had come under complete authority had come under the
[time=1531] complete authority of rome this had taken place bringing an end to any and all jewish independence
[time=1537] that same independence which they greatly treasured that freedom to be whoever they wanted to be
[time=1544] as their own nation it was lost completely when they fell under the power of rome from that time
[time=1550] on palestine belonged to the roman's in every way conceivable it was ruled palestine was ruled
[time=1557] partly by the by the herodians by the harrods the kings and palestine was also they they shared
[time=1565] joint leadership between the harrods and the governors and this joint leadership between the
[time=1571] harrods the kings and the governors was to say it mildly mildly just unacceptable and distasteful
[time=1577] to any jew they didn't want to be run by they didn't want to be overseen by anybody let alone a a gentile so it was a tough tough historical context that we find these things
[time=1591] developing and at the same time i want you to know this i know we're at the beginning here in matthew five at the beginning of the new testament understand that that virtually all other lands with which the new testament deals with had also been made subject to rome at this time
[time=1606] the roman empire at this point in time is at its absolute zenith the roman empire covered uh they
[time=1612] had full and absolute control over almost three fourths three fourths of the of the then-known world
[time=1618] they were an absolute superpower the only superpower and so the whole i say this to
[time=1624] you because i i'm trying to give you some history i want to give you some some context i want you to understand the literal setting to which this message gets spoken into the whole story of the
[time=1636] gospels my friends the whole life of jesus the background of it all falls into a framework of a
[time=1642] nation in absolute bondage to rome at the same time the jus had long been waiting for the kingdom of
[time=1652] who the kingdom of god to come they were waiting for their messiah the messiah that was going to
[time=1659] come they knew it they believed that he would establish that kingdom on earth that's right they
[time=1665] believed from what they had heard from what they had been told from what they had been taught they believed with everything in them that he was going to come and that he was going to establish an earthly kingdom he was going to set up the promised kingdom of which the prophets had spoken
[time=1682] their anticipation was heightened all the more as you read more about this
[time=1689] as roman oppression escalates the tighter the roman's held control over them the more they longed
[time=1696] for the kingdom of god to come and when and then think about this so that they've got all this tradition they have all this heritage they have all that they've been taught by their grandfathers and their great grandfathers and the rabbis and and all through their lives they had been told about this great and glorious kingdom that was going to come and not just the kingdom but they were told
[time=1717] prophecy indicates that there would be a king so imagine if you are them what you would begin to
[time=1724] feel when a guy named john the baptist all of a sudden shows up on the scene and this guy named
[time=1731] john the baptist has one clear overarching message and that is that the kingdom has come and not
[time=1740] just that the kingdom has come but the who has come say it loud the king absolutely that the king had
[time=1748] come and the king came boy did he come and what was his message he said in mark mark 115 you can
[time=1758] write it down he said the time is fulfilled this is jesus talking the kingdom of god is at hand
[time=1766] and so they all thought surely this is it it's our time it's what we've waited for this whole
[time=1777] things going to change this is the time of the messiah they thought he is going to come and he
[time=1784] is going to overthrow roman he is going to set up the independent jewish state and he's going to
[time=1790] bring us the glories of the kingdom that have been promised through all the centuries by all the prophets they were as a jewish people in that day my friends they were passionate about this
[time=1803] passionate you could see that passion in a number of different ways let me show you two two groups of people that speak to this one would be called the zealots you can write this down there were those in the jewish community there who were known as zealots and a zealot was somebody
[time=1818] who was absolutely and thoroughly convinced that a the messiah was coming and b he was going to come
[time=1825] and kick some tail and take names they were convinced that this was going to be a military
[time=1832] deal there was going to be some bloodshed there was going to be some fighting there was going to be a physical overthrowing of roman and these zealots were zealots about this they preached it they taught
[time=1845] it they believed it zealots passionate about the king and his return in the kingdom there was
[time=1853] another group you can write this down the Pharisees there was the Pharisees now they weren't so much about the military power the Pharisees were more about the miraculous they were more about the spiritual they believed that the messiah would come and overthrow whoever was controlling Israel
[time=1870] through miracles they were more theologians write that down they were more theologians than they were
[time=1876] soldiers in their mindset and in their in their thinking they were more interested in the fulfilling
[time=1882] of the power of god on a miraculous level than simply a mere military level and they were waiting
[time=1888] for Messiah to set up his kingdom by some incredible wave of the supernatural some miraculous powerful
[time=1897] act or series of acts by which he would decimate the Roman power and take personal control of the land
[time=1906] either way zealots or or Pharisees everybody in here's the point I want you to to sense here
[time=1913] everybody in the room was anticipating some cataclysmic some supernatural takeover some
[time=1921] dramatic intervention and now understand this when Jesus comes onto the scene he comes into this kind
[time=1930] of environment he comes into this kind of expectation the hope of a political or miraculous conquering
[time=1938] of Rome a restoration of the land back to the people of Israel but God's plan wasn't anything anything like what they had anticipated
[time=1955] you think about it Jesus disappoints the zealots because he doesn't bring an army
[time=1961] he doesn't pull off a coup he doesn't come in with swords and with power he disappoints the
[time=1969] Pharisees because this is interesting he disappoints the Pharisees how's your memory we just talked about it Pharisees were looking for the for the what the miraculous
[time=1980] do you think they had seen some yeah oh my goodness they they wanted them they wanted
[time=1987] the miraculous overthrowing of Rome they see Jesus they've watched him heal the they've watched him
[time=1994] give sight to the blind they've watched him give voice to the dumb they've watched him help crippled
[time=2001] people walk I mean they watched him make food with his own hands but they're ticked at him because
[time=2008] he won't use the power to over watch this here's a here's the line I want you to remember for later
[time=2014] he won't use the power to fulfill their agenda because he's meek because he's gentle it's amazing and they're finally so angered by Jesus
[time=2032] that their irritation turns to bitterness and their bitterness turns to hatred he was a tremendous disappointment to them they can't stand him now he has completely
[time=2048] and thoroughly let them down they knew he had spiritual power they knew he had miracle power
[time=2054] and yet he wasn't using it to fulfill their plans that disappointment turned to hatred and eventually because of that hatred what did they do to them they killed him they murdered him
[time=2067] they had him crucified now in hindsight you know what we should because sometimes we carry these
[time=2076] same presuppositions more importantly they should have known better in hindsight we really should
[time=2082] have known that that wasn't the direction that he was going to go it wasn't going to happen the way
[time=2088] they thought it should have happened and you know what in verses like where we are this morning Matthew
[time=2094] 5 5 right at the beginning of his whole ministry they should have they should have sensed it because it's right there in verse 5 I think where everything really everything really gets launched everything gets out there he just puts it right out there on the table their disappointment really started
[time=2111] here in verse 5 when he said blessed are the meek because that's not what they wanted to hear
[time=2118] what they wanted to hear and you probably already know this and we naturally think this way what
[time=2124] they wanted to hear is blessed are the powerful in their minds when they thought about Rome in light
[time=2131] of this context I've just given you in their minds you want to be blessed you want to you want to inherit the kingdom you want to you want to rule it takes might it takes power it takes pride
[time=2144] it takes accomplishment they they were really very ignorant regarding the servant character
[time=2150] and heart of the Messiah one thing you can just write down you could just just for this week or for
[time=2158] this month whenever you might want to give yourself to it write down Isaiah 44 right down Isaiah 40
[time=2165] through 66 it's a lot I know I'm not asking you to read it this afternoon but if you read through
[time=2173] listen if you read through Isaiah 40 through about Isaiah 66 and you just took a chunk at a time
[time=2179] you catch the spirit so much of the prophecy of Isaiah 40 through about 66 gives you and I this
[time=2188] picture of who he was going to be and how he was going to come and what he was going to do and what he was going to be about and what his priorities were going to be and how he was going to conduct himself it's amazing and you read that you realize he was going to come to the poor
[time=2203] he was going to come to the to the imprisoned he was going to come to the downtrodden he was
[time=2209] coming to preach the gospel not wheel of sword all of this indicated something of his humility
[time=2216] rather than him coming as a conquering hero he continually referred to himself as the humble
[time=2222] servant he says in mark he says the son of man did not come to be served but to what say it
[time=2228] serve and to give his life a ransom for many and now watch this watch this now okay now back to
[time=2235] the beatitudes and now here in the beatitudes he says and just imagine how shocking this must have
[time=2242] been his kingdom he says now in the beatitudes his kingdom belongs to people who are broken in spirit who have no self-confidence who don't believe in themselves at all the kingdom belongs to people who are weeping and mourning and now he says to people who are meek and gentle and you're sitting there on that hillside you're sitting there steeped in your jewish tradition
[time=2262] you're thinking how in the world can this be how is the Roman government going to be overthrown
[time=2270] how in the world can the great kingdom of god be established by those who are broken and mourning
[time=2278] and meek it was absolutely the antithesis of everything they would have assumed or hoped for
[time=2285] ever found yourself in that spot what do i mean by that have you ever found yourself in a situation
[time=2295] similar to to theirs have you ever found yourself in a spot where you just knew
[time=2302] god was going to move you knew god was going to do something you were just convinced because of
[time=2308] what you knew about god and because what you knew about this situation you just knew that this is
[time=2315] how it was going to go and it was going to happen at this time and it was going to happen on these terms and this is how the whole thing was going to play out have you ever been in that spot
[time=2327] only only to then realize that you know what he did move and he did act but he did it
[time=2333] over here he did it at this time he did it this way he used these circumstances
[time=2341] and you and i are left shaking our heads with a choice to make and it was the choice that these folks were faced with it wasn't anything like
[time=2352] what they had hoped for for generations and generations in the past and the beatitudes
[time=2360] jesus says it isn't the self-sufficient it isn't the self-righteous it isn't the proud it isn't
[time=2367] the strong it isn't the capable it isn't the courageous it's not the confident it's not the
[time=2373] satisfied it isn't the angry the powerful the rebellious who are going to experience the kingdom
[time=2379] or be happy in the beatitudes we are learning and we will learn in the weeks to come my friends
[time=2387] that that it is for the morning the broken the meek the hungry the thirsty the merciful the pure
[time=2394] the peacemaking the persecuted the reviled and the slandered those are the ones who get to be happy
[time=2403] and those are the ones scripture says that enter into and are part of the kingdom of heaven
[time=2409] let's go to the definition what does it mean to be meek what does it mean to be gentle
[time=2419] what does it mean what are we really talking about when we talk about meekness i want you to
[time=2425] write some of this down i read one commentator last week that said be careful when you look it up
[time=2432] in the dictionary because oftentimes the dictionary really gives you the wrong idea some dictionaries actually say deficient in spirit and courage they say deficient in spirit
[time=2442] and courage it's the definition of meek in a lot of places you and i might turn to it is not the definition of the word corbin mentioned earlier and it is the greek word pross p-r-a-u-s
[time=2454] but before we get to that someone who is gentle or meek write this down someone who is gentle or meek
[time=2460] is someone who does not assert themselves someone who is not consumed and watch how this word agenda
[time=2466] comes back into the conversation someone who is not consumed with his or her own agenda
[time=2472] someone who does not assert themselves someone who could but they don't they're not consumed with
[time=2481] his or her own agenda the person who is broken think about it the person who is broken over his
[time=2487] own condition the person who mourns over his sin is not about to assert himself wouldy
[time=2495] would she someone who is meek or gentle is someone who shows a quiet willing submission
[time=2503] write that down a quiet and willing submission to god and his guess what his what his agenda
[time=2512] this stands in direct contrast to the stubborn wilful rebellious self-centeredness
[time=2518] of you and i in our natural state sometimes that word pross was used to describe a soothing medicine
[time=2526] as corbin mentioned earlier gentleness meekness is you might want to write this i think you should write this one down in fact i think this is probably the one that says it most succinctly and most accurately gentleness meekness my friends is power under control it is a person who has yielded
[time=2542] up control to someone else in this case god all the strength is there all the power is there
[time=2549] it's it's just not self-asserted i had katie just put this on a slide where whenever you have
[time=2557] a broken heart look at this whenever you have a broken contrite heart whenever you have a sense
[time=2563] of spiritual bankruptcy whenever you have mourning over one sinfulness you have submission
[time=2570] and submission a posture of submission an attitude of submission submissive acts submissive thinking
[time=2579] coming under him this my friend submission is meekness that is meekness here's three here's three words
[time=2588] for you um these are just back to that word pross i want to i want you just to have some pictures
[time=2596] of meekness some pictures of gentleness power under control just write these three things down wind
[time=2603] write down wind how many in the room have ever been sailing raise your hand if you've ever been sailing oh i got a few okay decent others of you who didn't raise your hand you can use your imagination and most of you who have been or are imagining it maybe can just picture in your mind
[time=2619] what it's like to be sitting on the top of that deck you and your family you and a loved one
[time=2625] little picnic you know some sandwiches a gentle breeze a breeze that's under submission a breeze
[time=2633] that's cooperating hits the sail and just poof off you go great day now like in the next moment
[time=2641] right now think of a tornado think of the destruction think of the devastation think of the death
[time=2648] think of the absolute decimation that's brought by wind that's not submissive that's not under control
[time=2654] wind that is out of control same wind just showing itself in a much different way
[time=2661] think about water lord would you throw my bottle of water right there thank you so much
[time=2667] don't you hand it to me thank you very much bottle of water just think about water for a moment this water waters water right you think about this water right here your thirsty
[time=2678] it take a drink of water you got a little bottle of water here this water is in submission to right
[time=2685] this water is under control it's water but it's just it's right there just doing its thing it doesn't
[time=2691] disappoint the same stuff this same stuff out of control you know and I know it breaks levees
[time=2700] it breaks levees in New Orleans it breaks levees in Iowa and that same stuff that I just sipped
[time=2709] that brought refreshment same stuff brings death it brings the loss of hundreds of millions of
[time=2716] dollars and crops it ruins people's lives it's absolutely destructive think about fire
[time=2723] think about how nice it is after you mow the lawn I guess it wouldn't really work because
[time=2730] you'd mow the lawn in the spring so forget that think about how nice it is when it's really cold outside and you come in one evening with your wife and or loved one and you get to enjoy the warmth
[time=2743] and the peacefulness and just the relaxation of a fire there in the living room quiet and just
[time=2750] you with me and then just think about that I mean that fire there is under submission to that
[time=2757] fireplace under control and then just think about that fire think about what you and I see on the
[time=2763] news these days as we watch the wildfires again burn through California think about back years and years and years ago the city of Chicago going up in flames the destruction the death you with me under submission under control out of control not submissive peace and warmth and comfort
[time=2784] what's right on the one hand death and destruction on the other meekness power under control
[time=2793] let me remind you what it says in Psalm Psalm 37 write this down which I want you to see this
[time=2801] this is really where you know Jesus as he speaks my friends Jesus as he teaches he always teaches and speaks out of the whole of God's God's truth and really this verse is I think rooted in Psalm 37
[time=2814] 11 but look at Psalm 37 1 turn there if you would or follow along carefully no I want you to as I
[time=2821] read through this I want you to note the phrases note some of the meek see if you can pick them out some of the meek phrases as I read through this try and locate and kind of put your finger on
[time=2833] some of the gentle phrases phrases that indicate a gentle meek spirit at work all right Psalm of
[time=2841] David Psalm 37 1 do not fret do not fret because of evil doers be not envious toward wrong doers he
[time=2849] says for they will wither quickly like the grass and fade like the green herb verse 3 it says trust
[time=2855] in the Lord trust in the Lord and do good dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness delight
[time=2862] yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart commit your way to the Lord
[time=2870] trust also in him and he will do it he will bring forth your righteousness as the light and your
[time=2877] judgment as the noon day rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him do not fret because of him who
[time=2886] prospers in his way because of the man who carries out wicked schemes cease from anger and forsake
[time=2894] wrath do not fret again it leads only to evil doing for evil doers will be cut off but those who
[time=2902] wait for the Lord they will inherit the land yet a little while and the wicked man will be no
[time=2910] more and you will look carefully for his place and he will not be there and here it is my friends but the humble but the meek but the gentle but the lowly will what inherit the land blessed
[time=2926] are the gentle for they will inherit the land and will delight themselves in abundant prosperity
[time=2932] did you see those phrases go back in your bible to verse 3 trust in the Lord go to verse 4 delight
[time=2940] in the Lord trust in him delight in him trust in your agenda or his delight in whose agenda
[time=2947] his verse 5 commit your way to the Lord verse 7 rest in the Lord do not fret is there in verse
[time=2957] 7 verse 8 do not fret again verse 9 wait for the Lord and down in verse 11 the humble the meek
[time=2964] the gentle will inherit the land here's the point my friends and you can write this in your bible you can write this on your notepage all of those are the attitudes of the meek all of those things
[time=2976] you see there in Psalm 37 are the attitudes of the gentle they just they give up everything for the purposes of God they trust in him they delight in him they commit their way to him they
[time=2988] rest in him they do not fret they wait for him patiently this is what it means to be gentle to
[time=2996] be meek you can write these words down to trust the light commit rest cease to trust the delight
[time=3004] to commit to rest and to cease the psalmist is saying be meek don't trouble yourselves when
[time=3012] the wicked prosper don't trouble yourselves when your plans don't come to fruition God's blessing belongs to those who yield up to him and what else can someone do who has nothing
[time=3025] to offer it's a great great truth now I want to make sure we're clear on this
[time=3034] because some people think again even though we've tried our best here in the last several minutes to say it differently some people still think that to be meek means to be wimpy
[time=3045] listen the Lord I read this this week the Lord may call you to do something that's going to take
[time=3053] tremendous courage you understand that don't you God may call you to engage in something even in
[time=3060] the next few days that may take and require from you enormous guts meekness isn't wimpiness the
[time=3068] Lord may call you to do something that's going to take tremendous energy and effort on your part
[time=3074] meekness gentleness it's not a lack of conviction or effort it's not a wishy washingness it's not
[time=3081] some kind of benign human niceness it really is faith in the truest sense that trusts God
[time=3091] that is willing to decrease a faith that's willing to shrink itself and its own strength
[time=3098] to experience the strength and the largeness and the bigness and the might of God I love this you
[time=3106] can write this down in myself nothing is possible the meek gentle person says in myself nothing
[time=3112] is possible therefore I yield to him in whom what say it out loud everything is possible three ways to practically pursue gentleness and meekness this week I hope
[time=3125] you'll do this I hope you'll take this to heart I hope you'll give it some thought individually I hope you'll talk about it with your kids I hope you'll do it in your small group hope you'll talk about it in your class three things number one memorize the verse I hope you got your your
[time=3140] God wants you happy study guide they're available for you out at the guest center daily scripture readings many of us in the black hawk family are committed to faithfully reading through these
[time=3151] scriptures each day of the series you can pick those up there's a memory verse there there's questions for you after each daily reading it's really really good stuff I would encourage you
[time=3162] in light of our discussion today memorize that verse talk about it pray through it
[time=3169] consider the implications of it again on your own or with your family here's one for you identify
[time=3176] a very difficult situation that you know is coming and commit right now to follow God's lead
[time=3183] now I know this won't apply to everybody but a lot of you in the room myself included you know
[time=3192] you're going to have that meeting this week you know you're going to bump into her again
[time=3198] you know that that that situation's going to come up you know it work you know at home
[time=3204] you know in the neighborhood you know in your world there is that specific situation that is
[time=3210] coming this week and in that situation you'll have a choice to make you know it
[time=3216] and you'll either power up you'll either clench your fist and bring to that situation your strength
[time=3223] and your power and your opinion and what you know needs to happen or right now
[time=3229] you'd have the willingness to submit all that to just stop all that and just say you know what
[time=3236] I want to in that situation because I know it's coming I want to submit God to you please help me
[time=3244] help me be as soft and as sensitive as I need to be whatever strength I'm going to bring to it God
[time=3250] let it be yours does it make sense many of you know that that's coming others of you maybe you
[time=3257] don't see anything coming but you know like I know that oftentimes they present themselves and I would hope that you would be willing in your heart this week to take this study and this discussion of meekness and gentleness and apply it right there on the spot to allow him to be strong
[time=3274] to allow him to be mighty and allow you to be under him allowing whatever strength and power
[time=3281] you're going to bring to the situation to be what only he would provide number three find a list find a list of God's attributes you can you can email us somebody even told me first hour you can
[time=3294] Google it it's true I think you can find it a lot of different places it's a great list of God's
[time=3303] attributes and commit that list this week commit it to memory or commit it to discussion
[time=3311] with those in your life and here's why the Corbin's prayer this morning the prayer that Corbin let us in my friends it was so appropriate because you understand what this means okay this
[time=3322] doesn't mean you know I'm not shaking my fist in God's face by any means I'm saying I'm humble
[time=3328] before you God and yet whatever strength I had comes from you and when you look at that list of
[time=3334] attributes my friends here's the thing you and I can be meek and you and I can be gentle we don't
[time=3340] have to be all of that because he's all of that he's strong and he's mighty and he's all knowing
[time=3349] it he's wise I mean just look at that list and then just say to God through the week oh God how
[time=3356] grateful I am that you're going to do and be all that and I just get to come right underneath you and just follow along however you might lead with my humble heart and my willingness to exercise
[time=3369] whatever strength you might offer because you're who you are just look at that list
[time=3377] I hope you'll do it I I want you to be happy I want you deeply happy I just want to make sure
[time=3387] we're happy on God's terms poor in spirit morning gentle and meek let's stand and pray
[time=3396] Father God thank you for the morning and the chance to be together I pray God that your word
[time=3403] as we think about it and as we consider it as we talk with our friends and family about it as we pray on these things oh God please there is a meekness I know in me that is missing
[time=3415] so many times there is a gentleness that is absent from my words and my thoughts so many times
[time=3425] and I pray God that you'd help me and I pray God you'd bring help and encouragement to others in the room who need it like I do we want to be happy and fulfilled God we want to act
[time=3437] and live like those who are a part of your kingdom and so God would you please in the days to come
[time=3444] move us in that direction we look forward to this week to fasting on Saturday noon to noon
[time=3453] Saturday to Sunday God in an effort to just physically be reminded of a hunger and thirst
[time=3459] that can only be met in you teach us and encourage us and grow us through that experience and through
[time=3466] the teaching from your word next week as we gather again to be encouraged to be together
[time=3473] to experience your presence as we have today we love you and all the people in the room agreed and said amen God bless you
[time=3508] you
