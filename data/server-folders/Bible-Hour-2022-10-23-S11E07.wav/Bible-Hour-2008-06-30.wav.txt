[time=0] I'm assuming every person in this room really likes the idea of deep blissful
[time=6] enjoyment, deep lasting satisfaction. I'm assuming everybody in the room is
[time=12] really okay with the idea of really being truly significantly happy.
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=58] It is over, it is finished. Now the battle has been won.
[time=66] Sin is conquered, death is vanquished, with the rising of the sun.
[time=74] Let the darkness scatter, hear the lion roar.
[time=81] The land is over come, the land is over come, the land is over come, we are free, forever free.
[time=99] He is justice, he is justice, he is mercy, he is ever on our side.
[time=109] See the mind, king of glory, swing the gates of heaven wide.
[time=117] Let the darkness tremble, hear the lion roar.
[time=124] The land is over come, the land is over come, the land is over come, we are free.
[time=139] The land is over come, the land is over come, the land is over come, the land is over, we are free, forever free.
[time=160] If the sun has set me free, then I am free, I'm free indeed, and nothing can take that from me when I am free, forever free.
[time=179] There is now no condemnation, there is now no separation, if the god of my salvation says I'm free, forever free.
[time=195] If the sun has set me free, then I am free, I'm free indeed, and nothing can take that from me when I am free.
[time=209] Forever free, there is now no condemnation, there is now no separation, if the god of my salvation says I'm free, forever free.
[time=226] The land is over come, the land is over come, the land is over come, the land is over come, the land.
[time=248] The land is over come, we are free, forever free, the land is over come, we are free.
[time=274] Well, good morning everybody, welcome to the broadcast, again it's great to have you with us, and I hope you've been with us over the last few weeks.
[time=282] What a series God has led us to, what a teaching we've been able to encounter in this study that we've entitled God wants you happy.
[time=290] It's been a study of the Beatitudes in Matthew chapter five, and the fact of the matter is God really does want you and I to be extremely happy.
[time=300] It's just that He wants us happy on His terms. He wants us to define happy the way He defines it, and that's why this study has been so insightful and so encouraging.
[time=312] Hey, if you've missed any of it, don't forget you can go to our website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=317] You can just go down the right hand side of that homepage and click on the link that allows you to view our messages and you can just watch the Bible Hour broadcast right there online anytime during the week.
[time=330] Hey, I also want to say thank you to many of you. While many of you watch, others of you participate in those times when we invite you to come and be a part of whatever God might be doing here at Blackhawk.
[time=342] And recently many of you came and you participated in our generous living garage sale.
[time=347] You brought all your junk, all your stuff, all your treasures, if you will.
[time=352] And I want you to know that after it was all said and done, the garage sale this year raised, I think, over $13,500.
[time=362] Over $13,000 was raised so that we could send all that money to Nairobi to the New Life Home Trust Orphanage to help them build a special needs unit for the orphans there who have special mental or physical needs.
[time=378] I can't say thank you enough. I can't tell you how much it means to us that you would partner with us in something of that nature.
[time=386] So thank you. Thanks for being a part of our family. Thanks for tuning in each week. Again, I hope you'll come by sometime on a Sunday morning at 9 or 1045 and say hello.
[time=396] We'd love to meet you. And I hope this morning will be an encouragement to your heart and soul. God bless you.
[time=402] As always, we hope to see you again soon. A picture of being in right standing with God. So we'll stand for this posture and as a symbol of hunger and thirst, we'll place our hands over our stomach and our throats.
[time=414] And please hold this posture while I lead us in a prayer time. The words will be on the screen for you to read, but before we pray out loud together, let me just remind you of some passages.
[time=426] First of all, the beatitudes says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness." Psalm 42 verses 1 and 2 says, "Is the deer pants for streams of water? So my soul pants for you, O God."
[time=442] "My soul thirsts for God for the living God." Psalm 84 verse 2 says, "My soul yearns even faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God."
[time=458] Let's pray these words together. "Living God, you are the author of life, the author of salvation, and the satisfaction of our souls. We long for you, hunger and thirst for you, and find ourselves in desperate need of you today."
[time=479] One day spent in your house beats thousands anywhere else. We'd rather be lowly servants in your household than be honored guests in the palace of sin.
[time=493] Jeremiah 2.13 says, "My people have committed two sins. They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and they have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns, that cannot hold water."
[time=507] Let's pray this prayer in response to Jeremiah.
[time=511] "Merciful Father, we confess that our hearts have ignored and forsaken you. We are too easily enticed by the cares of this world, the cravings of sinful man, the lust of our eyes, and the boasting of what we have in due. God, please never let us find satisfaction in these things.
[time=534] Make our sinful strivings, leave us unsatisfied and unfulfilled, starving for your righteousness. May our souls pant, yearn, and faint for you alone."
[time=549] The second part of the beatitude promises that those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be filled.
[time=557] Reminds me of John 4 where Jesus is telling the woman at the well, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give will become in him a spring of living water, welling up to eternal life."
[time=576] "Let's pray this together. We praise you Father for devising a way for enemies like us to drink of your thirst quenching water. We honor you Jesus for ushering in the water of life through the power of your death on the cross. We exalt you, Holy Spirit, for residing in us as a spring of living water.
[time=603] Thank you, God, and three persons, for filling us today and giving us hope in ultimate, eternal fulfillment in the age to come. Amen.
[time=616] We're going to sing a few songs together, and I want to invite you to remain standing as we sing. And if you feel led to just hold that posture of hunger and thirst as we sing, I think that would be very appropriate as these songs remind us of our desperate need for God.
[time=631] Let's sing together.
[time=647] How love is your dwelling place, O Lord Almighty, for my soul longs and even faith for you.
[time=671] One here my heart is satisfied within your presence. I sing beneath the shadow of your wings.
[time=691] One thing I ask and I would see, one thing I ask and I would see, to see your beauty, to find you in the place your love be dwells.
[time=719] Better is one day in your courts, better is one day in your house, better is one day in your courts, and thousands of swear, better is one day in your courts, better is one day in your house, better is one day in your courts, and thousands of swear.
[time=742] I'm hearted flesh, my hearted flesh dry out for you the living God, your spirit's water for my soul.
[time=755] I've tasted and I've seen no one's again to be. I will come dear to you. I will come dear to you.
[time=776] We don't need to. You alone will feel, satisfy our souls.
[time=791] Better is one day in your courts, better is one day in your house, better is one day in your courts, and thousands of swear, better is one day in your courts, and thousands of swear.
[time=814] Better is one day in your courts, better is one day in your house, better is one day in your courts, and thousands of swear.
[time=844] Lindsey's going to start this song for us this morning, and as you learn it, please join in and adore God with us.
[time=859] The universe is at your feet, gives you praise evermore.
[time=871] The stars light the sky for you, always, God be praised, and least pleased.
[time=886] It's on high, 40s on high.
[time=892] I adore you.
[time=905] And there's not that compares to your majesty, oh no.
[time=918] I adore you.
[time=930] And I stand in the wonder of your love.
[time=941] Sing that again.
[time=945] The universe is at your feet, gives you praise evermore.
[time=957] The stars light the sky for you, always, God be praised, and least pleased.
[time=970] I adore you.
[time=991] And there's not that compares to your majesty, oh no.
[time=1004] I adore you.
[time=1016] And I stand in the wonder of your love.
[time=1034] We will crown you, King forever, living sailor, Jesus redeemer, Lord of heaven.
[time=1052] Woke in majesty's men, glory, creation, and glory.
[time=1061] Holy, holy, God Almighty, and forever, Lord in sing song and hear the angels.
[time=1077] Shout His angels.
[time=1082] God, we adore you.
[time=1087] Holy, holy, God Almighty, and forever, Lord in sing song and hear the angels.
[time=1102] Shout His angels.
[time=1105] Ever nearly, nearly, I adore you.
[time=1112] We adore you.
[time=1117] This is the year by pre.
[time=1135] Your holy presence, living in me.
[time=1151] This is my daily prayer.
[time=1164] Your very word, spoken to me.
[time=1177] And I, I'm desperate for you.
[time=1187] Oh, and I, I'll all stay down here.
[time=1202] I'm desperate, and I, I'm desperate for you, Jesus.
[time=1216] And I, I'll all stay down here, lost without you.
[time=1230] I've lost without you.
[time=1258] Father, God, we desire to hunger and thirst for you alone,
[time=1266] to be desperate for you, to be lost without you, to find our soul's satisfaction in who you are,
[time=1277] and find our soul's dissatisfaction in the things of this world that fool us into thinking that they're real or eternal or lasting.
[time=1293] And that it would be so for the sake of your name and the sake of your kingdom,
[time=1299] and to honor Christ and His sacrifice and death on the cross, that our lives would be transformed and changed.
[time=1312] We love you, God, and ask that it would be so, and in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1318] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1327] Well, this morning as we transition, I just want to review with you where we've been,
[time=1333] and what brings us to today as far as the Beatitudes are concerned.
[time=1337] Let's, let's take the posture of poor in spirit.
[time=1341] Cut your hands in the air and repeat after me.
[time=1351] Okay, what just happened?
[time=1353] Let's try it again.
[time=1355] Should we just say it all together?
[time=1356] That worked well.
[time=1357] Here we go.
[time=1358] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1363] Amen to your face and your hands.
[time=1365] Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[time=1369] With a hand over your heart and a fist in the air, blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth, and now standing for our new posture, with a hand on your stomach and on your throat.
[time=1382] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
[time=1389] Thanks, you may be seated.
[time=1391] Well, it's me again.
[time=1392] I want to just, one more minute if I could, to just tell you how thankful I am, for the response that we've gotten to our series, this incredible study that God has led us to in Matthew 5.
[time=1403] We've entitled it God once you happy.
[time=1406] And Steve Longbrake comes this morning to continue in that teaching.
[time=1411] I wanted to just say two things.
[time=1412] Number one is I'm struck again and again by the flow of this passage.
[time=1418] It's amazing to me how when someone is poor in spirit, that poorness of spirit, that brokenness leads to mourning.
[time=1428] When you think about somebody who's mourning, when you think about somebody who's remorseful over their sin, that leads to the gentleness and the meekness that we talked about last week.
[time=1439] And you know what, when someone's poor in spirit and mourning over their sin and gentle and meek in their spirit, that person is then set up to hunger and thirst for righteousness, which is exactly what Steve's going to teach you about, and talk with you about this morning.
[time=1456] Let me say this as well.
[time=1457] I just want to say thank you to Steve.
[time=1459] Many of you know what a significant contribution Steve has made to the life and ministry of our church and school over the past 25 plus years.
[time=1469] His wisdom and his insights, his knowledge and his willingness to love and serve you and me and this family for all these years is something that God has used in an incredible way.
[time=1482] And I'm so thankful that he's still a part of our teaching team so thankful for the effort that he gives that and thankful that you get to be the recipient of that effort this morning.
[time=1492] So Steve, thank you for teaching and church family.
[time=1495] Thank you this morning for giving your hearts to our God in worship, and I pray and hope that you'll give your hearts to him this morning as Steve opens up the Word of God.
[time=1510] God wants you to be happy.
[time=1513] He really does, blessed.
[time=1515] He really does.
[time=1517] And he wants you to be hungry.
[time=1522] He says, so be hungry.
[time=1524] God wants you to be happy.
[time=1526] So be hungry.
[time=1528] For what should you be hungry?
[time=1530] Well, that's a pretty important question.
[time=1533] He wants us to be hungry and thirsty.
[time=1536] And we know a little bit about that.
[time=1539] I don't know much.
[time=1541] Some of you may know more about hunger and thirst than I do.
[time=1545] I don't know much about it.
[time=1547] I've been well fed, obviously.
[time=1551] Well fed and water's been available all of my life.
[time=1557] And the closest thing I could come to it in my own experience was to think
[time=1565] about the times I was hungry when mom would let me keep playing through lunch.
[time=1572] I begged for that all the time.
[time=1574] Once in a blue moon.
[time=1576] What is a blue moon?
[time=1578] Once in a blue moon, mom would let me actually keep playing something through lunch that we were excited about.
[time=1585] I'd play through the afternoon and then play late and finally go and eat, and by that time I wanted to eat.
[time=1592] I mean I was hungry.
[time=1595] But that kind of hunger, when you only miss one meal, sort of like what you did here today,
[time=1604] that's not the same as what some people experience.
[time=1607] And so I thought I better do something about that and I'll introduce you to a friend in a little bit that can help there.
[time=1615] Thirsty.
[time=1616] I don't know much about that either.
[time=1619] I got my mind rolling back thinking about when have I been really thirsty and there were times like cross country practices at the end of practice, thirsty.
[time=1630] A couple, if we had two a day basketball practices, thirsty, especially in the summer.
[time=1638] But I remember the time that strikes me most, that I remember being thirsty, was a time I was working in a field.
[time=1645] I learned in a small farm town and the farmers would hire me to work their land sometimes and help them farm.
[time=1651] I remember being on this 40 acre field, I was working the land, probably just disking after somebody plowed.
[time=1658] And it was one of those hot days in the spring.
[time=1662] We don't have those very often but it was a really hot and dry day.
[time=1665] And I'm disking and the dust is rolling and it was hot.
[time=1669] And I was on that tractor.
[time=1671] It was in the afternoon and swallowing the dust and sweating on this tractor with the heat coming off the tractor as you go to -- you know what I'm talking about.
[time=1682] And I got really thirsty and I forgot my water jug.
[time=1688] And every time I got to the end of the field, I came to the end and I knew right on the opposite side of this fence row that I finished at, the drain tile were feeding into this little ditch right there.
[time=1699] The drain tile out of the field.
[time=1701] That's not the best water to drink, you know.
[time=1704] Her herbicides, pesticides, fertilizer of all kinds.
[time=1709] But every time I got to the end, I wanted to get down off that tractor so bad and have a drink of that water.
[time=1715] Finally, I caved in.
[time=1717] And I took the smallest little drink of water you have ever experienced in your life, but man, that was so quenching.
[time=1725] I was desperate for it.
[time=1729] But you know what?
[time=1730] I can think of the time.
[time=1735] I was thirsty.
[time=1737] I can think of the time I was a little hungry.
[time=1742] And so I thought it would be better for me to ask a friend what it's
[time=1748] like to be hungry and thirsty.
[time=1750] Who knows that?
[time=1751] So Jones, would you come up here please?
[time=1753] Would you please stand?
[time=1755] This is Jones and Gertrude Bekimi from Uganda.
[time=1758] Please welcome them.
[time=1759] (Applause)
[time=1768] Great.
[time=1769] (Applause) These are, these are dear friends of Nancy and me, Corbin and Tanya too.
[time=1778] Corbin and Tanya actually showed them around Rome like Corbin and Tanya knew how to get around Rome.
[time=1789] Jones is co-founder, Jones and Gertrude,
[time=1795] are co-founders of a place called New Hope, Uganda.
[time=1800] It's in Luero District, a place called Kasana.
[time=1805] The Lord's been working there.
[time=1807] We know something about that place some of you should, because we just sent Caleb and Lare there last week.
[time=1813] Caleb and Lare Mitchell are going to serve at New Hope, and it was so interesting.
[time=1818] Jones and Gertrude happened to be here when we were sending them there.
[time=1823] So Jones and Gertrude received them when they only had to take about two steps instead of going all the way to Uganda.
[time=1830] Uganda to be received.
[time=1831] The ministry that they have there at New Hope is an incredible ministry.
[time=1837] They have about more than 500 children that are educated and fed, trained.
[time=1842] They learn how to farm.
[time=1843] They learn how to do vocational school.
[time=1845] They learn academic education, really well equipped.
[time=1848] They've done a great job, and they've been doing it for 20 years.
[time=1852] 20 years.
[time=1853] The celebration actually happens this next week, the 20-year anniversary.
[time=1857] And so Jones and Gertrude are going to hurry home.
[time=1862] But in Uganda, hunger and thirst has a little different feeling to it
[time=1873] than it does for me.
[time=1875] So I thought I'd ask Jones, Jones, have you ever been hungry, or do you know, can you describe people that have been hungry, or have you experienced it yourself?
[time=1885] I would say yes.
[time=1887] I've been hungry.
[time=1890] My parents separated when I was a small boy.
[time=1894] And so we were, myself and my siblings were taken to my grandparents.
[time=1900] And there were several of my cousins who also were there.
[time=1905] And shortly my grandfather, who was the provider, passed away.
[time=1911] And we would be served on a train.
[time=1916] And all the kids, about six, seven kids, would be there, and so would pray in the name of Father, Son, Spirit, and go.
[time=1926] And just land there, the one who chewed faster, eight more.
[time=1931] And so that was one meal a day.
[time=1935] And if you missed the chew fast, you definitely starved.
[time=1941] In spite of the one meal, I remember my sister almost starved to death, because the rest of us were boys.
[time=1947] And eventually they had to exempt her from fighting in the trade.
[time=1952] And one day I was still small, and I was going to the nearby church school.
[time=1959] We had not done our homework, our home chore.
[time=1964] And my auntie said, if, since you didn't work, you won't have dinner.
[time=1972] And that was very painful.
[time=1976] And it caught us when I could not go in the neighborhood to pick some raw food.
[time=1983] So we went to sleep without any food.
[time=1987] In the morning we had it at school, so my stomach was screaming.
[time=1992] I was very, very hungry.
[time=1995] And of course, literal food, plus no food overnight, makes it double hunger.
[time=2002] And I remember passing by a sogam garden.
[time=2008] Sogam, some of you may know it, but it's like a millet, or it's a cereal, a crop,
[time=2017] and it puts on hands.
[time=2019] And so I plucked three hands, and two, I put them in my hand and under my arm, and I grabbed one, and I was hurling to the school.
[time=2027] And I just started munching this.
[time=2029] You stole the sogam.
[time=2031] I did.
[time=2032] Yeah.
[time=2033] I had two in order for me to survive.
[time=2035] Yeah.
[time=2036] And so I went munching this, and I was eating so fast so that I could get at least two of them
[time=2043] before I get into, before the bell goes for lining up.
[time=2049] And as the bell went for us to line up the school, I didn't care what was happening.
[time=2057] I just rushed in the line with my sogam, and I was just chewing like there was nothing happening.
[time=2064] I was just saying, let me eat and feel my tummy, because my stomach was really pain.
[time=2072] And the teacher called and said, "John, stop that.
[time=2076] It's school time." And I looked at him and just continued chewing.
[time=2080] He said, "I said, throw that away." And I looked at him and just busting tears.
[time=2086] I screamed.
[time=2087] He was terrified.
[time=2088] He had never seen me like this.
[time=2090] Of course, he didn't know what was happening at home.
[time=2093] And he left me.
[time=2095] And I just went ahead.
[time=2098] I didn't stop until I finished, where until I got something in my tummy.
[time=2104] Now, it's a little bit of the many times I experienced hunger.
[time=2109] How about your potato story?
[time=2111] Tell me about that.
[time=2113] Another day I had come from school.
[time=2116] And there was little food left.
[time=2121] There was about five potatoes.
[time=2123] The smaller ones were about this size.
[time=2125] You never peel those.
[time=2128] And so they just washed them and put them in a saucepan.
[time=2131] Because if you peel, you throw away so much food.
[time=2134] So you just pick it as it is and eat the whole piece.
[time=2138] And so when I brought this, I started off with the smaller ones.
[time=2143] You know, saying, "Let me first eat of the smaller ones.
[time=2146] Then I will finish up with the big one." I had just finished the last small one when my aunt called and said, "Hey, your cousin has not had anything to eat.
[time=2160] So you better leave that one for him." I almost screamed.
[time=2165] Because I knew this was the literal, I had kept aside.
[time=2169] And from that time I said, I will never start from the small ones.
[time=2174] Now, some of you have that.
[time=2177] Up to now, when you serve me, I look for the best piece in the food.
[time=2181] And that's the one I start with.
[time=2184] Have you been thirsty?
[time=2187] Many times.
[time=2190] Particularly, I remember, the place where we are doesn't have rivers.
[time=2196] The water, it's a bit semi-dry.
[time=2201] And the only water is, at least at that time when we went in 1987,
[time=2207] it was through valid dams.
[time=2210] They dug valid dams with the tractors.
[time=2213] So allowed the water to come into this valid dam through just the flow in the valley.
[time=2220] And the rainwater carries every kind of water, everything.
[time=2227] The cows come and drink from there.
[time=2229] The people come and step there and just beat the water like this.
[time=2233] And so on any particular day, and so much that you have no time to think the appearance.
[time=2240] The water looks like, you can imagine, just like soup with some floating stuff there.
[time=2250] So just beat the water and just fall there and drink.
[time=2255] Whether you are going to fall sick or not, but that's what you have to drink.
[time=2259] And I remember one time they did the effort and boiled it and put it in a cup.
[time=2265] And looking into it, I thought they had poured soup in a cup.
[time=2269] But you can't avoid but to drink it because that's the only drink that you have.
[time=2276] One of the things that they've done at New Hope is to drill boreholes.
[time=2281] And there's good water available.
[time=2283] And the whole community has benefited from that.
[time=2285] They come from a long way to carry their water from those boreholes.
[time=2289] That's been a great thing.
[time=2291] Jones, what does it mean to you to hunger and thirst for righteousness?
[time=2298] To me, having lived a life that was searching for value after I had grown up as an orphan
[time=2309] in this hunger environment, and then eventually the Lord saved me.
[time=2315] He put inside me a hunger, a different hunger.
[time=2319] And I know sometimes I get these nice drinks, these nice foods, and I start craving for them.
[time=2326] Inside me there is that yarning, that searching that says I want Jesus.
[time=2333] I don't want anything.
[time=2335] Like I was hungry for that saga and I could not be stopped by anything.
[time=2339] I still crave that I don't want anything to stop me short of tasting my Jesus.
[time=2346] And daily that he is my bread, he's my cake, he's my chocolate drink.
[time=2352] He is the one that satisfied that in a longing because there is nowhere else I have found
[time=2358] it.
[time=2359] [AMEN] Yeah.
[time=2361] Let's pray for them.
[time=2363] Father in Heaven, I thank you for my brother and my sister.
[time=2369] Lord, they've been my brother and sister before I ever met them.
[time=2373] I just didn't know them then.
[time=2376] But now I know them well.
[time=2379] And I know how much they depend on you.
[time=2384] I know how much they long for righteousness and Christ.
[time=2390] And I pray you would bless Jones and Gertrude as they lead and serve there in Kasana.
[time=2398] Please bless them, Lord.
[time=2400] In Jesus' name I pray.
[time=2402] [AMEN] Thank you.
[time=2404] Thank you, Jones.
[time=2405] I wish you had time to hear more of their stories.
[time=2411] They have some really good ones.
[time=2414] In the first service he said his brain was vibrating.
[time=2417] I forget what that was about.
[time=2422] Well, God wants you to be happy.
[time=2425] Blessed.
[time=2426] So be hungry.
[time=2430] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
[time=2441] If you're poor in spirit, if you're mourning the reality of that, if you are gentle meek,
[time=2455] that should cause you to be hungry and thirsty for righteousness.
[time=2464] I hope you listened closely to what he said.
[time=2467] I said, Jones, what does it mean to you to be hungry and thirsty for righteousness?
[time=2473] And he said, Jesus, the righteousness that comes any other way is not righteousness.
[time=2484] The reality is we are not right with God outside of the blood of Christ.
[time=2495] And so seeking righteousness, hungering for righteousness, thirsting for righteousness means
[time=2502] I'm hungry for more relationship with him who is the righteous one.
[time=2508] I'm thirsty. I'm panting like a deer after the righteous one.
[time=2521] One definition for hunger would be appropriate craving.
[time=2527] Cravings, I heard mom and other women talk about cravings a lot when I was a kid.
[time=2533] I didn't know exactly what was going on, but it was pickles and ice cream then.
[time=2537] Cravings, I always wondered why babies didn't get sick from the things those women ate.
[time=2542] Cravings, I've heard about cravings.
[time=2548] This is an appropriate craving.
[time=2551] This is something that has captured me and I can't get it off my mind.
[time=2557] When I've been a little bit hungry, I know what that means.
[time=2561] It's appropriately craving something. It's a strong desire.
[time=2566] An eager desire is what Webster says.
[time=2570] It's interesting, you know, that kind of thirst is the same kind of thing.
[time=2575] Thirst is something that I'm painfully wanting refreshment.
[time=2584] I need refreshed and it hurts. I desire it so much.
[time=2590] It's painful. I'm painfully wanting refreshment.
[time=2593] I'm so thirsty that it totally captures my attention.
[time=2599] I'm so thirsty that I'm longing. It's an ardent desire.
[time=2604] Again, I saw craving listed again when I looked up thirsty.
[time=2607] A vehement craving. When you're really thirsty, you must satisfy it.
[time=2613] You can't get your mind on other things because you demand satisfaction for this thirst that you have.
[time=2626] Are you hungry like that?
[time=2631] Are you craving righteousness?
[time=2635] Are you so thirsty for righteousness that you can't start your day without thinking about the reality,
[time=2643] who the righteous one is that brings you righteousness?
[time=2647] That's what Jesus is saying here.
[time=2649] Here in this beat, he's saying, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness."
[time=2655] It goes in this righteousness that can be satisfied.
[time=2661] Isn't it interesting?
[time=2664] Righteousness was speaking to them.
[time=2669] Psalm 143, 6, it says, "I stretch out my hands to you.
[time=2675] My soul longs for you as a parched land." I'm like a parched landlord, Sela.
[time=2683] I long for you.
[time=2688] It hurts I want righteousness so much.
[time=2693] A person who's poor in spirit.
[time=2698] A person who's mourning the reality of that.
[time=2703] A person who is meek and gentle now can hunger and thirst for righteousness and get satisfaction.
[time=2712] Are you there this morning?
[time=2714] Are you one of these hungry people?
[time=2717] Are you one of these thirsty people that knows your need and longs for the satisfaction that comes
[time=2726] in drinking living water, eating the bread of life?
[time=2730] That's who he said he was.
[time=2735] Righteousness.
[time=2736] I love this.
[time=2737] Righteousness.
[time=2739] Righteousness is as we ought to be.
[time=2744] We created Adam and Eve if sin had not entered in, they were as they ought to be.
[time=2752] And we would be as we ought to be, if not for sin.
[time=2757] Sin separated us from his holiness, his righteousness.
[time=2763] And in my state, in my condition, I'm not as I ought to be.
[time=2771] I'm not in a condition acceptable to God, saved through the righteous one.
[time=2778] So again, it's me remembering the fact that I'm poor in spirit.
[time=2787] Remembering the fact that that grieves me, that causes me to mourn.
[time=2791] Remembering the fact that I'm meek and gentle.
[time=2795] Remembering that and I remember that he is righteousness in me as we ought to be.
[time=2806] Well, what an incredible, incredible passage of Scripture we get to look at now.
[time=2814] Matthew chapter 5, look at this with me, 17 through 20.
[time=2820] Jesus says, "Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets.
[time=2826] I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.
[time=2830] For truly I say to you until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke
[time=2836] shall pass from the law until all is accomplished.
[time=2841] Whoever then annals one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps and teaches them,
[time=2852] he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." The law keepers, the law keepers, were trying to earn their way there.
[time=2868] The law keepers were trying to be righteous.
[time=2873] And Jesus says, "Unless you exceed all of that, unless you exceed the person who has
[time=2881] kept the law the best, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."
[time=2887] Romans tells us that the law is there to help reveal our sinfulness to us.
[time=2896] We know we need help because we can't keep it perfectly.
[time=2904] Our sinfulness is revealed to us, the law does that for us.
[time=2907] He said, "I'm not abolishing it, I'm fulfilling it.
[time=2911] In me," he says, "in me you can exceed that."
[time=2921] For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees,
[time=2927] you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2929] His righteousness does.
[time=2933] Hallelujah.
[time=2936] His righteousness does exceed the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=2944] And in him, satisfaction.
[time=2955] He's the righteous one.
[time=2957] Righteousness is as you ought to be.
[time=2964] And then he says, "You can get satisfied." It's a desire met, it's refreshed.
[time=2974] Oh, have you ever, Jones and I were talking, I don't like to drink cold water when I'm thirsty.
[time=2979] When I'm really thirsty, I just want that room temperature water.
[time=2983] Because then I can drink a whole lot more of it, I don't have to.
[time=2986] And it just goes down.
[time=2987] Do you know that feeling that you get when it's really been hot and you get a cool glass of water?
[time=2996] And you just start drinking it down.
[time=2998] And when you drink that one and you just, it's this.
[time=3002] Oh, yeah.
[time=3005] Wow.
[time=3006] You even hear people say it, don't you?
[time=3008] You hear the awk come out when people drink like that.
[time=3011] That's the kind of satisfaction.
[time=3013] Now, not just multiply that.
[time=3015] And get eternal life.
[time=3018] And just drink of the living water and get, he says, "You can just experience in life.
[time=3025] You don't have to keep striving." When you're hungry and thirsty, for me, you don't have to keep striving because I'll satisfy you.
[time=3037] Do you feel, ah, this morning?
[time=3043] If you don't, you can.
[time=3048] You just receive the gift Christ is giving.
[time=3055] Desire met refreshed.
[time=3058] I love Isaiah 49.
[time=3059] Let's look at that together.
[time=3061] Verse 7 says, "Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and its holy one, to the despised one,
[time=3070] to the one abhorred by the nation, to the servant of rulers.
[time=3076] Kings will see and arise, princes will also bow down, because the Lord who is faithful,
[time=3083] the holy one of Israel, who has chosen you.
[time=3088] Thus says the Lord, in a favorable time I have answered you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you,
[time=3095] and I will keep you and give you, for a covenant of the people, to restore the land to make them inherit
[time=3104] the desolate heritages.
[time=3107] Saying to those who are bound to go forth, to those who are in darkness show yourselves.
[time=3112] Along the roads they will feed, and their pasture will be on all bare heights.
[time=3117] They will not hunger or thirst, nor will the scorching heat or sun strike them down.
[time=3123] For he who has compassion on them will lead them and will guide them to the springs of water.
[time=3130] I have prophesying about the Lord Jesus himself, the living water, he doesn't need to lead us anywhere else.
[time=3136] He is the spring of living water.
[time=3142] I chose an Old Testament passage to talk about satisfied, and then I chose John 6, let's look at that.
[time=3149] John 6, 35, Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life, he who comes to me will not hunger,
[time=3155] and he who believes in me will never thirst."
[time=3162] Corbin mentioned John 4, Jesus and the disciples were on the road, and they got to Samaria,
[time=3173] and the woman came to the well, and disciples went on to get some food for Jesus.
[time=3179] He stood and talked to the woman at the well, and he obviously, as you know, shared with her the reality of the living water that he had available.
[time=3190] And she came to Christ, and she went back to town and she told everybody, and many people got saved, they came out to see him.
[time=3196] And the disciples came back a little later, and they said, "We brought you some food." And he said, "Not hungry." And they said, "Who gave him food while we were gone?" And he said, "You don't know the food, of which I have to eat."
[time=3212] You know what? We do now. It's him.
[time=3216] He is our living water. He is the bread of life.
[time=3223] He is our righteousness.
[time=3228] And I went to an epistle, Philippians 4, 12, and 13.
[time=3232] He says, "I know how to get along with humble means," Paul said.
[time=3236] "I also know how to live in prosperity. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.
[time=3251] I can do all things through him who strengthens me." I hope nobody ever taught you to memorize that verse in the context of you being able to do whatever you want to do.
[time=3265] That verse has been thrown around a lot over the years.
[time=3270] When people want certain circumstances to go away, or they want certain circumstances to become a reality in their life, they might quote that verse.
[time=3279] It could be mishandling the Scripture there.
[time=3282] In context, he's saying, "I've learned the secret. I've learned the secret to contentment. I can do all things through him who gives me strength.
[time=3291] It doesn't matter if I'm well fed or I'm thirsty, if I'm rich or I'm poor, if I'm experiencing plenty or want, I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[time=3303] He is our righteousness.
[time=3308] And then I went to Revelation, Chapter 7.
[time=3315] Then one of the elders answered saying to me, "These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where have they come from? I said to him, "My Lord, you know."
[time=3326] He said to me, "These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb."
[time=3337] For this reason, they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple.
[time=3343] And he who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them.
[time=3348] They will hunger no longer, nor thirst any more, nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any heat, for the lamb, for the lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to springs of water of life, and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.
[time=3370] One day, not only will we not be dissatisfied, longing, because we're in a world here that's filled with hunger, and thirst, and calamity, and trauma, and people looking for answers in other places than in the righteous one, but one day we'll be there with him.
[time=3391] And there will be no thirst and no hunger. My question for you today is, are you experiencing that satisfaction spiritually this morning because you're hungering and you're thirsting for the righteous one?
[time=3406] I hope you are. Are you longing for him?
[time=3414] He makes you righteous before the living God. And in that, knowing that is incredible satisfaction. I'm satisfied.
[time=3436] Would you please? Living God, we are a desperate people.
[time=3454] We are lost people, but you found us.
[time=3462] We raise you for the satisfaction we can experience as a reality as we walk out of this room, because we've been made righteous through the blood of the righteous one.
[time=3479] [AMEN]
