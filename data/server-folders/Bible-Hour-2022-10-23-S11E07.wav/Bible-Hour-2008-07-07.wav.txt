[time=967] We sang a line in that song.
[time=971] It says, "Hast thou not seen all thy desires?
[time=975] Air have been granted in what he ordaineth." It's kind of a funny way to say, isn't it amazing that every desire I've ever had
[time=985] is granted by God in his sovereignty in the way that he ordains each desire to be met?
[time=993] Not desires in my flesh, but desires that his spirit puts on my heart when his spirit reigns and rules in my life.
[time=1002] I think that phrase, "Hast thou not seen how all thy desires air have been granted in what he ordaineth?" I think that phrase aligns a lot with our beatitude for today.
[time=1014] This morning, we're going to be talking about, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy." And by way of review, we're just going to move through all five of the postures and each of the beatitudes.
[time=1027] The new posture for today is just simply this, a hand that's outstretched, symbolizing acts of mercy.
[time=1035] And then just moving our heads to the left and right, symbolic of our eyes being peeled and looking for opportunities to be merciful.
[time=1044] They're all around us, but unfortunately, sometimes our eyes are blinded to needs of merciful acts.
[time=1052] So let's review all five postures together, finishing with the merciful one.
[time=1056] Would you cup your hands in the air and repeat after me?
[time=1060] "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,
[time=1068] and covering your faces, blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted, and place a hand over your heart, and the other one a fist in the air.
[time=1081] Say, "Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth,
[time=1088] and please stand symbolic of righteousness." We learned this last week with a hand over your stomach and a hand over your throat, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[time=1103] for they shall be satisfied." And let's extend a hand for mercy and look to your right and left, saying, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy."
[time=1119] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1123] This morning, Jill's going to sing a song for you.
[time=1127] This is Jill, and her husband Andrew's up there on guitar.
[time=1130] I introduced them to you briefly last week.
[time=1133] Andrew and Jill are full-time missionaries for Campus Crusade, and they're sponsored by Black Hawk Church, and we're really thankful that they're on our team of missionaries that we get to sponsor.
[time=1145] They're with us this summer, and when I found out that Jill could sing like she does, and I knew Andrew played guitar like he does, I invited them to be a part of our team this morning, and they're going to do that again in August.
[time=1156] She's going to sing a song for you this morning that speaks to mercy a lot, and I want you to listen in closely and watch what's on the screens as we kind of experience this together.
[time=1166] But know this about Jill and Andrew.
[time=1168] I asked them to stick around after service today to meet some of you.
[time=1171] I think it would be good for all of you to know them because they're a part of us, an extension of Black Hawk throughout the world as they do music around the globe.
[time=1180] But they're spending summer here partly because they've only been married for seven weeks and probably deserve a break in order to get that marriage thing down.
[time=1188] You've got a few more weeks to master it, and then before they're out on the road again, and they're also raising support.
[time=1196] They have a big financial burden right now, and I can't imagine having to do what they do and all of the spiritual burden on their shoulders to spread the gospel around the world, and then to have a financial need on top of it.
[time=1209] I just think it would be awesome if we as their church family could do whatever we can to help take some of that financial burden off of them.
[time=1217] So if you'd like to meet them after service, they'll be down front, and I'd encourage you to do that.
[time=1221] But Jill, sing for us this song.
[time=1236] [MUSIC] God of justice, save your tool [MUSIC] Came to rescue the weak and the poor [MUSIC] Came to serve and not be served [MUSIC]

[time=1515] (gentle music) - It's hard to look at those pictures
[time=1538] because they're not a reality in my life and I don't think they're a reality in years.
[time=1545] I live in an ice home, I've never been hungry
[time=1553] on my wife and kids are all well fed and too often I just close my eyes and pretend that pictures like that don't exist.
[time=1564] So it's uncomfortable that it might be to watch that this morning.
[time=1568] I think it's good for us to remember that that's real and that happens around the world.
[time=1573] The song that Jill sang said, "Move us into action." What a great prayer.
[time=1579] God just don't let us feel compassionate about those pictures but move us into action so that there would be a way that we could do that.
[time=1587] My prayer is that you would find a way to move into action, to be merciful to people like that.
[time=1596] - Hi everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.

[time=1750] Don't forget August 7th and 8th.
[time=1751] Go to our website, and we can't wait to spend a couple of days together.
[time=1756] If I could ask you to bow your heads yet again as we begin this morning, I want to read some Scripture to you and then pray with you.
[time=1770] Micah, chapter 6, with what shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before God on high?
[time=1778] Shall I come with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?
[time=1783] Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil?
[time=1790] Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression?
[time=1793] The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
[time=1796] He has told you, oh man, what is good?
[time=1801] And what does the Lord require of you?
[time=1804] But to do justice and to love, kindness, mercy,
[time=1810] and to walk humbly with your God.
[time=1814] Almighty and most merciful Father, we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.
[time=1822] We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts.
[time=1825] We've offended against your holy laws.
[time=1828] We have left undone those things which we ought to have done.
[time=1836] And there is no health in us, Father.
[time=1839] Have mercy on us, miserable offenders.
[time=1842] Spare God, those who confess their faults restore, those who are penitent according to your promises declared to mankind, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=1853] Grant almost merciful Father for his sake that we may hereafter live a godly,
[time=1860] righteous, sober, and merciful life to the glory of your holy name.
[time=1869] [AMEN] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
[time=1876] Victor Hugo, in his classic novel, Les Miserables.
[time=1880] Les Miserables translated means something like "the miserable ones" or "the wretched."
[time=1888] It's a story of a convict, Jean Valjean, set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century.
[time=1897] As the story begins, Valjean has been released from prison after 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread.
[time=1903] He is unable to find work as a literally marked man.
[time=1908] At his lowest point of miserable desperation, Valjean is taken in by a bishop and is forced to make a choice.
[time=1919] Valjean chooses poorly.
[time=1922] Steel's from the bishop is arrested again by the authorities and is brought again before the bishop who shows him mercy.
[time=1933] In the wake of this demonstration of mercy, Valjean's life has forever changed.
[time=1938] He turns from darkness, since that's not a new path of integrity, life, and light.
[time=1947] As we begin this morning, it's necessary to review where we've been.
[time=1951] We're five weeks into the study now, and I am more and more persuaded by the day that the Beatitudes build on one another.
[time=1959] There are some notes there to help you follow along.
[time=1962] We'll spend some time at the first year laying out the groundwork where we've been up until this morning.
[time=1967] It's the very much a progressive set, the Beatitudes.
[time=1972] By way of introduction, I'll say this, letter A in your notes.
[time=1976] The Beatitudes are descriptive, not prescriptive.
[time=1982] This is essentially important, and before we get too far ahead of ourselves, I want to make sure we lay it out as carefully as we can.
[time=1988] They are descriptive, not prescriptive.
[time=1991] Let me explain.
[time=1992] The first thing Mitchell Cruz called us to five weeks ago was to be, I have the notes, to be.
[time=1999] For the Christian person, who we are, determines what we do.
[time=2006] It's clear, not the other way around.
[time=2008] In philosophical terms, our essence defines our experience.
[time=2014] For the postmodern humanist, however, our experience defines our essence.
[time=2021] Put more simply, for the Christian, again, who I am, determines what I do.
[time=2027] For the non-Christian, under most circumstances, what I do determines who I am.
[time=2032] Friends that is not in play in the Beatitudes.
[time=2037] I'll take you to Kelly's comments, the week after Mitchell, that the Beatitudes are for the disciples, they are for the redeemed person.
[time=2046] And it is very much the cart before the horse.
[time=2050] If we try to put on these things, pour in spirit, morning, gentleness, hungering and thirsting for what is right, before we know Jesus Christ.
[time=2060] It is futility.
[time=2063] It is meaningless.
[time=2065] You may never achieve blessedness by your achievement.
[time=2069] Quite the contrary, if that were true, the Holy Testament collapses under its own way.
[time=2075] There is no grace if you merit blessing by what you do, then what's the rest of it all about?
[time=2081] That needs to be set up front, friends.
[time=2083] I think we're getting ahead of ourselves, at least I am a little bit.
[time=2085] Need to be reminded of these things.
[time=2088] As Peter says in his letters to be stirred up by way of reminder, that we do not conjure up blessing by what we do.
[time=2098] Because we know Jesus Christ, we are blessed, therefore we are merciful.
[time=2103] Therefore we are hungry and thirsty for what is right.
[time=2107] Therefore we are poor in spirit which leads to morning and gentleness.
[time=2114] Richard Gardner says it like this.
[time=2117] Stavins, like the Beatitudes, seem to suggest that the process of showing mercy begins with us.
[time=2123] That, however, is not the case.
[time=2125] It's God who is merciful and gracious first.
[time=2129] And the people of God are who they are because they have received God's mercy.
[time=2135] Please let that guide you this morning, let it guide every one of us.
[time=2142] Let it be there in your notes.
[time=2144] We'll jump into the actual Beatitudes now.
[time=2146] Having laid that foundation, it's extremely important.
[time=2150] If you are here this morning and you do not know Jesus Christ, maybe you know about Him or maybe you know about poverty of spirit or morning or make your list from Matthew 5.
[time=2162] If you are about that, but don't know Jesus, I plead with you.
[time=2166] I beg you to know Him.
[time=2169] To respond to His offer of salvation by grace through faith.
[time=2174] Today is the day of salvation, my friends, not tomorrow, but today.
[time=2178] Respond to Him in faith.
[time=2181] I would call you to do that.
[time=2182] After the service, find me, find Kelly, find Corbin, find someone that you know knows Him.
[time=2192] Blessed are the poor in spirit who mourn.
[time=2196] You see the progression.
[time=2197] Poverty in spirit, as Kelly mentioned, is a right understanding of our spiritual poverty.
[time=2203] It's the fundamental characteristic of a Christian person, poverty of spirit.
[time=2207] In those hands, right? Nothing.
[time=2211] It is that word "tokos" from the Greek that we used in previous weeks.
[time=2214] It means lacking in spiritual worth, nothing.
[time=2218] I have nothing before Him.
[time=2221] You see how there is no merit, how I don't earn blessing by my behavior.
[time=2226] It's very much there in the text.
[time=2229] Only people who understand their spiritual bankruptcy have the promise from the first beatitude, the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2237] Who gets the kingdom of heaven? Those who are spiritually impoverished.
[time=2241] It's completely counterintuitive, it's not what you would think, and that's the beauty of it.
[time=2246] Of God's kingdom, God's kingdom is not made up of people who are granted entrance meritoriously because they deserve it.
[time=2255] I've got my act together, and so God's going to let me in.
[time=2260] God sure likes me a whole lot, so maybe He'll let me in.
[time=2263] No, the only appropriate reaction to my spiritual beggar is mourning.
[time=2271] The horror of sin, my sense of loss, helplessness, despair, but doesn't stop there,
[time=2278] I move from mourning to comfort because I know that in Christ and only in Christ are my sins forgiven.
[time=2286] I know that one day He will wipe every tear from our eyes, the tears that we shed watching those images this morning.
[time=2294] There will be no more hunger, no more poverty, no more famine or war, any of it, every tear that will be wiped from their eyes.
[time=2303] Praise the Lord.
[time=2305] Those who mourn understand these things, John 16 describes the pain that comes through childbirth, and in the end, there's wonderful comfort when we have the baby.
[time=2315] If we stop with the mourning and never go to the comfort, it seems a little bit backwards, a little bit incomplete.
[time=2321] We move then to, let her see, blessed are the meek who are hungry.
[time=2327] Two weeks ago, Kelly talks about meekness or gentleness.
[time=2331] The word for Greek, the word for meek there for gentleness is "praus" in the Greek.
[time=2338] It's used, fascinatingly, it's used of Jesus in its triumphal entry when he's on the donkey.
[time=2343] From Zechariah chapter 9, it's quoted, "Behold, your king is coming to you, praus, mountain of the donkey." This word has a sense of not being impressed with your own importance, and it's used of Jesus.
[time=2358] Can you get your mind around that?
[time=2360] I can't even imagine.
[time=2362] The king of glory on a donkey described as meek, gentle, humble, remarkable.
[time=2370] It's used in 1 Peter 3, verse 4 of a godly wife who has the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=2378] This Thursday is Jody and I's nine-year anniversary.
[time=2383] And I can only praise God that he gave me a wife that has this imperishable beauty of a quiet spirit, a gentle spirit.
[time=2391] I'm so glad that she said yes, I don't know why she did, but she did.
[time=2397] It is the blessing of a good wife, men.
[time=2400] Who can measure that?
[time=2402] Can the men say amen to that, please?
[time=2407] Kelly described this meekness or gentleness as subjugated power, like fire or water or wind,
[time=2414] out of control, very dangerous, in control, very useful.
[time=2421] In 2 Corinthians, chapter 6, Paul helps us figure out what the promise is of that beatitude, about inheriting the earth.
[time=2428] Listen to what he says.
[time=2431] Listen carefully, please.
[time=2433] Working together with him, 2 Corinthians, chapter 6, verse 1, working together with him, then we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain, for he says, "In a favorable time I listened to you.
[time=2443] In a day of salvation I have helped you.
[time=2445] Behold, now was the favorable time.
[time=2448] Behold, now was the day of salvation." We put no obstacle in anyone's way so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but a servants of God we commend ourselves in every way by great endurance and afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger,
[time=2468] by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love, by truthful speech,
[time=2474] the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left, through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise.
[time=2483] We are treated as imposters and yet are true, as unknown, yet well known, as dying and behold we live, as punished and yet not killed, as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing,
[time=2495] as poor, yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing everything.
[time=2504] Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth.
[time=2508] There you have it.
[time=2509] Possessing everything is a promise given to us in the person of Christ.
[time=2517] Next last week, the other Steve talked to us about hunger and thirsting for righteousness.
[time=2523] Both hunger and thirst in the Greek have a sense of a strong desire.
[time=2527] It isn't like, I like to have it lemonade right now.
[time=2530] It's not like that whatsoever.
[time=2532] It's a strong, almost an urgent desire for hunger, thirst, for food, for drink.
[time=2539] The word "righteousness" is a very, very important word.
[time=2543] The basic sense of it here is rightness, right before God in right relationship to Him.
[time=2550] They strive, they hunger, they thirst, they urgently seek righteousness and they will be satisfied.
[time=2558] The word for satisfied there is not fleeting by definition.
[time=2563] It's an inward satisfaction, truly satisfied.
[time=2567] Listen to what Clarence Jordan says about this.
[time=2571] "One might eat and eat of the superficial cotton candy righteousness, vended by the professional religious hucksters, and never have his hunger, assuaged, fulfilled.
[time=2583] Or he might drink and drink of their holy water and never have his thirst quenched.
[time=2587] But the kingdom righteousness is meat indeed, and drink indeed, rich, nourishing, satisfying.
[time=2596] And all that friends brings us to mercy in the fifth beatitude." What does it mean to be merciful? Who are the merciful? What is mercy?
[time=2606] Let's define those terms together before we launch out.
[time=2609] A mother once approached Napoleon on behalf of her son seeking a pardon for him.
[time=2614] The emperor replied that the young man had twice offended and just as to man did that he be killed.
[time=2622] The mother replied, "I'm not asking for justice, I'm asking for mercy." Napoleon replies, "Well, your son doesn't deserve mercy." The mother replies, "If he deserved it, it wouldn't be mercy." And Napoleon pardoned the son.
[time=2638] Mercy will define this morning, this way, letter A in your notes,
[time=2644] "Kindness or goodwill towards the miserable and the afflicted, joined with a desire to help them." Do you see how when the definition of the word "action" is there?
[time=2658] It never can be just an abstract concept, friends.
[time=2661] It's action. Move us into action.
[time=2666] Could not be a more perfect song this morning.
[time=2670] Matthew 18 is the parable of the unmerciful servant.
[time=2676] Peter came up and said to Jesus, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I should forgive him?" Seven times?
[time=2682] Do you said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven." The important thing with that number, like the other number, is this, that there is no limit to the forgiveness.
[time=2693] Seventy times seven is code, if I can say that to you.
[time=2697] It's a metaphor for endless, boundless forgiveness.
[time=2701] It's not 490 times, it's never stop forgiving.
[time=2706] Therefore, the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.
[time=2711] When he began to settle, one was brought to him, who owed him ten thousand talents.
[time=2718] One talent is equivalent to twenty years' wages for a laborer.
[time=2725] One, and he owes ten thousand talents. I've done some rudimentary math, that's all I'm able to do.
[time=2732] And figured out that's about seven billion dollars.
[time=2738] So what's the point of that figure that he had to write him a check for that much and he'd be done?
[time=2741] No, that he could never achieve that figure.
[time=2745] It's impossible.
[time=2747] If that isn't plugged in here, guys, the rest of the parable makes very little sense.
[time=2751] He could never repay this debt.
[time=2755] And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold with his wife and children and all that he had,
[time=2761] and payment to be made.
[time=2763] So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.
[time=2768] And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.
[time=2774] But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denari.
[time=2779] A denari is a day's wage.
[time=2782] This is three months' salary as compared to ten thousand years of salary.
[time=2789] Ten thousand times twenty years unimaginable.
[time=2794] "Pay what you owe," he says.
[time=2797] His fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, "Have patience with me, and I will pay you." He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt.
[time=2806] When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed.
[time=2810] And they went and reported to their master, all that had taken place, that his master summoned him and said to him, "You wicked servant.
[time=2816] I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
[time=2821] And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant as I had mercy on you?
[time=2826] In anger, his master delivered him to the jailers until he should pay all his debt.
[time=2831] So also my heavenly father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."
[time=2837] Powerful words from Jesus.
[time=2839] Friends, please don't hear that parable in a strictly legal sense.
[time=2843] Again, if we do that, then we're in big, big trouble.
[time=2845] Then the rug is pulled out from underneath the New Testament, and we're in trouble.
[time=2850] Here in this spirit, what's said here is that if I have truly repented, if I've recognized my desperate and pitiful place before God,
[time=2860] I will be merciful.
[time=2862] I have understood the great debt, my seven billion, as it were, dollar debt has been paid, and I am free.
[time=2872] Someone who understands the great weight of their own forgiveness will be that kind of a person to others or ought to be.
[time=2883] How could I not be merciful to my neighbor?
[time=2885] Having rightly understood this, what's a hundred denari three months wages when I've been forgiven a debt far greater?
[time=2894] I am once again indebted to Dee Martin Lloyd-Jones in his book Studies in the Summer on the Mount.
[time=2900] He says this, "If all this is true of me, all these blessings, I no longer see men as I used to see them.
[time=2909] I see them now with a Christian eye as the dupes and the victims and the slaves of sin and Satan in the way of the world.
[time=2918] I have come to see them, not simply as men I dislike, but as men to be pitied.
[time=2923] I have come to see them as being governed by the goddess world as being still where once I was and would be yet but for the grace of God."
[time=2931] So I'm sorry for them.
[time=2933] I don't merely see them in what they do.
[time=2935] I see them as the slaves of hell and Satan.
[time=2938] And my whole attitude toward them is changed.
[time=2941] And because of that, of course, I can be and must be merciful with respect to them.
[time=2947] I differentiate between the sinner and his sin.
[time=2950] I see everybody in a state of sin as one who is to be pitied.
[time=2955] Do we have that mindset to those that do not know Christ, who are caught in sin?
[time=2962] They are slaves to sin and we accuse and say, "Stop sinning!"
[time=2968] The analogy I often use in my students is this, that we turn the light in the room, for example, is dark.
[time=2974] And we yell at the room to say, "Hey, there should be some light in there." And never turn the light on.
[time=2981] That's ridiculous.
[time=2984] Friends, you and I lament the debauchery we see around us every day.
[time=2990] If our reaction is accusation and you should stop doing that before offering them Jesus, then we have failed.
[time=2999] We have failed because they don't need to stop sinning.
[time=3003] They need to know Jesus, who is the only way to stop sinning.
[time=3008] That slavery is broken and on we go.
[time=3011] That's good news.
[time=3015] There you have it.
[time=3016] First of all will be found consorting with publicans and sinners, says Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
[time=3021] Careless of the shame they incur, in order that they may be merciful, they cast away the most priceless treasure of human life, their personal dignity, their honor.
[time=3032] For the only honor and dignity that they know is the Lord's own mercy, to which alone they owe their very lives, their very lives.
[time=3041] John 78 is Zacharias' prophecy after he hears his wife Elizabeth is pregnant with John the Baptist.
[time=3048] And he understands that his son will go on to be a prophet of the most high.
[time=3052] He says this, "Because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise, the day springs,
[time=3060] so visit us from on high." This is my favorite verse in the New Testament, probably.
[time=3065] If you force me to pick, I'll probably pick this one.
[time=3067] The word for tender mercy there is splachnon.
[time=3071] Isn't that a funny word?
[time=3073] The word splachnon means intestines.
[time=3077] It means your guts.
[time=3079] The Greeks and Romans felt like your guts, your intestines were the seats of your very violent passions.
[time=3084] Your splachnon in there.
[time=3088] The Hebrews though believe that your intestines were where your more tender passions lived.
[time=3093] Mercy, because of the splachnon of our God, the guts, so you see the great feeling that's
[time=3101] implied in that word.
[time=3103] The mercy of God.
[time=3107] A simpler definition of mercy, friends, is letter B when I don't get what I deserve.
[time=3112] In Ephesians 2, Paul describes that we are dead in trespasses and sins, that we are children of wrath,
[time=3119] sons of disobedience, and God in his rich mercy loved us when we were dead and made us alive in Christ.
[time=3127] Let her see.
[time=3129] God is the ultimate merciful one.
[time=3135] We don't have time to go back and look at all the mercy of God in the Old Testament.
[time=3140] It's extensive.
[time=3141] And this disarms the objection that we see sometimes.
[time=3144] Merciful people are, as D. Martin Lloyd Jones describes in the objection, well they're flabby sort of people.
[time=3151] They're very loose with sin.
[time=3153] Oh, that's okay.
[time=3154] Do whatever you want.
[time=3155] It's okay.
[time=3156] I'll be merciful.
[time=3158] If God is merciful as he is throughout the Scriptures, he was there in the verse I just read from Titus.
[time=3166] Then that disarms that whole notion of someone who is merciful being loose or careless or flabby about sin.
[time=3173] If God's merciful, no one would accuse him of being flabby about sin as you see his son on that cross.
[time=3181] Sin, not no big deal.
[time=3184] It's embarrassing even to say it.
[time=3186] God feels that way about sin.
[time=3191] How do I show mercy?
[time=3194] This is all very good.
[time=3195] It's all very much up here.
[time=3196] What about down here?
[time=3198] What's the hand outstretched?
[time=3200] How do I do that?
[time=3201] Three things I would share with you quickly.
[time=3204] From Psalm 51, I was sure that we need to be broken.
[time=3208] Someone who understands the great debt that they have been forgiven of will be a merciful person.
[time=3214] David says, "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love, according to your abundant mercy,
[time=3221] blot out my transgressions." He goes on and says, "Create me a clean heart, O God.
[time=3226] Renew a right spirit within me." Second, love your neighbor.
[time=3233] The parable of the good Samaritan follows after that very question.
[time=3239] The Pharisee says, "Who is my neighbor?" He's trying to justify himself.
[time=3245] And he tells a story about a man who has fallen among thieves and the righteous, righteous, walk past, do nothing.
[time=3254] And he helps him, but a Samaritan, a despised Samaritan.
[time=3260] Listen to how it ends.
[time=3263] Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?
[time=3267] The Pharisee replied, "The one who showed him mercy." And Jesus said to him, "You go and do likewise." Peter Creece said, "There are no good people, and the best of us say so the most clearly.
[time=3282] Only fools demand justice." Where we be if we got it?
[time=3289] Mercy is our only hope from God, and our neighbors only hope from us as well.
[time=3295] Love your neighbor, how?
[time=3298] Be merciful.
[time=3300] Lastly, be perfect.
[time=3302] Let's define the word perfect correctly, please friends.
[time=3305] The word there for perfect is teleos.
[time=3309] Listen.
[time=3310] The word teleos means brought to its end.
[time=3314] Finished.
[time=3316] Wanting nothing necessary to completeness.
[time=3323] Full age.
[time=3325] Mature.
[time=3327] I didn't see Kelly this week.
[time=3328] I talked him on the phone a couple of times.
[time=3331] Out of adolescence and to maturity.
[time=3334] Be perfect.
[time=3335] Be perfect means that we are mature.
[time=3338] We have come to a place where we know what we believe and we know why we believe it.
[time=3342] And it can be communicated to our neighbors.
[time=3344] They need, if not from us, friends from who?
[time=3347] Who will tell them if we don't tell them?
[time=3352] This morning I end with Bob Dylan.
[time=3359] In 1989 he released an album called Oh Mercy.
[time=3365] A couple of stanzas of them will pray.
[time=3368] This song is called Ringdom Bells.
[time=3370] Ringdom Bells ye heathen from the city that dreams.
[time=3373] Ringdom Bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams for their deep and their wide and the world on its side and time is running backwards and so is the bride.
[time=3384] Ringdom Bells sweep Martha for the poor man's son.
[time=3387] Ringdom Bells of the world will know that God is one.
[time=3390] The shepherd is asleep where the willows weep and the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
[time=3394] Ringdom Bells for the blind and the deaf.
[time=3397] Ringdom Bells for all of us who are left.
[time=3399] Ringdom Bells for the chosen few who will judge the many when the game is through.
[time=3404] Ringdom Bells for the time that flies, for the child, the cries when innocence dies.
[time=3413] Let's pray together.
[time=3418] Father, it's been good to be here this morning.
[time=3420] We need to be reminded of these things, to be stirred up by way of reminder.
[time=3425] Lord, make us merciful, but more than that, Father, before that, Lord, we need to know you.
[time=3432] If there is a person here, Father, that does not know you, may today be the day of their salvation.
[time=3439] Lord, those of us in this room that know you, Lord, we need to be these things in the side of the world.
[time=3446] Make us merciful, Father.
[time=3449] We have an embarrassment of riches.
[time=3451] Teach us to love others, to be merciful, to go.
[time=3457] Fill us up and send us out.
[time=3460] Father, I pray all of this in Jesus' precious name.
[time=3464] [AMEN]
