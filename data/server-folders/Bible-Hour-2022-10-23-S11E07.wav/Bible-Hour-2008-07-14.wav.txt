[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 49 seconds]
[time=90] (upbeat music) - Amen.
[time=100] - Can we praise God, clap our hands.
[time=102] (audience applauding) We thank Him for He is and for what He does for us.
[time=107] (audience applauding) He is worthy of our praise.
[time=111] - Hi everybody, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=113] Again, this morning we're thankful that you're with us.
[time=115] I want to say something this morning directly and specifically to you, those who are viewing and those who view on a regular basis.
[time=122] You know, I have been for a number of weeks now, really very boldly and very lovingly challenging our people here in the room on a Sunday morning with some very specific questions.
[time=135] You see, we've come to a place in our ministry here at Blackhawk where we have kind of drawn a line in the sand.
[time=141] We've just decided that we are going to invite and encourage our people to make a very, very important decision, will they be a tenders or will they be disciples of Jesus Christ?
[time=154] As they look at their spiritual lives, we're asking them, are they going to be pew sitters or are they going to be priests who pass along God to others?
[time=165] Are they going to view their involvement here at Blackhawk as just this deal that they're a part of that they come and do for 70 minutes on a Sunday?
[time=174] Or are they going to be a part of a revolution?
[time=178] Are they themselves going to be revolutionaries who fight against, really fight against, the direction of culture and claim back the freedom that God intended us to have in relationship with his son?
[time=191] These are life changing, future altering decisions and I was thinking about you all, the Bible our viewing audience this morning as I came in.
[time=202] I'm great asking them these questions.
[time=204] I think I want to ask you this question.
[time=208] I know many of you have church homes that you're a part of.
[time=211] Many of you are very active in ministry and in local churches and you know how we feel about that.
[time=216] We're thankful for that.
[time=217] But some of you are just attending.
[time=222] Some of you are just pew sitting and you're doing it at home and you're watching and we're thankful that you watch.
[time=227] But I wonder if maybe for you personally, I wonder if it's time for you to do more with us and watch.
[time=234] I wonder if it's time for you to participate.
[time=236] I wonder if it's time for you to get up and get dressed and get in the car and come and be with us and put your arms around us and let us put our arms around you and together we can give ourselves to this greatest of all endeavors, this thing called the church.
[time=250] I wonder if it's time for you to come and connect with us so that we can together see what it means to be disciples, to be priests who pass along God.
[time=260] I want, we want nothing more for you than all that God designed you to experience and I know he designed for you to come and give yourself fully to his kingdom work.
[time=273] So think about it, we're here every Sunday morning.
[time=275] You know that nine and 1045 and we'd love nothing more than to have you with us.
[time=280] Think about it, we're thankful for you.
[time=282] Thank you so much for tuning in this morning.
[time=284] I hope your heart is encouraged.
[time=287] This morning, like other mornings this summer, we're gonna review the postures and heart attitudes that we're trying to emulate that are written out for us in the Beatitudes all summer long.
[time=299] We've been talking about how God wants us to be happy.
[time=303] Not in the way the world defines happiness, but in the way the scripture defines happiness, also known as blessed, also known as macarias and we're on that pursuit of being a people who are truly blessed by God and defining that in a new way.
[time=317] It's been one of my favorite studies that we've done ever since I've been around Blackhawk for over six years now.
[time=323] I just really enjoy the truth that we're getting to meditate on together.
[time=328] Our posture for this morning is for blessed or the pure in heart for they shall see God.
[time=334] And we've got hands together.
[time=335] You'll see our stick figure up there and it's just this picture of rubbing your hands clean in that motion reminding us in a physical way of what our hearts should be doing.
[time=345] Our memory verse for this coming week is Psalm 24 and it talks about how those who ascend the holy hill of God have clean hands and a pure heart.
[time=353] And so that psalm for us associates a pure heart with also clean hands.
[time=358] So our physical posture is rubbing our hands clean with our heads lifted to heaven.
[time=364] So would you do that for me?
[time=365] Would you rub your hands and look to heaven and just repeat after me?
[time=369] Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.
[time=375] (audience murmuring) - Great.
[time=378] And every week we've taken some time to review all of the other postures and I kinda wanna take a break from taking all six of the physical postures and just talk a little bit about Jesus and the role that he takes.
[time=393] God in flesh who walked among us, he also inhabited every one of these beatitudes.
[time=399] I was thinking about it earlier this week and thought we could just walk through each one together and talk a little bit about how Christ is those things.
[time=408] The first one, blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.
[time=413] Wait, that was this week.
[time=414] Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[time=416] That was the first week that we had.
[time=417] And I thought about this.
[time=418] The essence of poverty in spirit is an attitude of humility and you think about the person of Jesus and very clearly in Philippians two, it says that Jesus who being in very nature God did not consider equality with God something to be grasped and it describes for us Christ's attitude of humility or Christ's attitude of poverty in spirit.
[time=442] So I think it's important for us to remember that Jesus was poor in spirit.
[time=446] The next one, blessed are those who mourn Christ.
[time=451] It tells us in the word of God was sinless and he never did anything apart from the law.
[time=457] No wrongdoing as long as he lived but we do see Christ mourning over sin.
[time=463] Time and time again, he is mourning over the sin of humankind and he laments it.
[time=468] And so we see Christ as one who mourns over sin like we should mourn over sin.
[time=474] The next be attitude, blessed are the gentle.
[time=477] I can't think of anybody who walked the face of the earth more gentle than the person of Jesus.
[time=482] And as we were reminded about Jesus entering Jerusalem on the donkey, it was prophesied that he would be gentle and riding into Jerusalem on a donkey.
[time=493] Jesus is gentle.
[time=495] The next be attitude, hungering and thirsting for righteousness.
[time=499] Jesus calls us to do that but he also does the very same thing himself and we see over and over in scripture Jesus pulling away and Jesus having quiet moments with the Lord in times of solitude and times of prayer where he is hungering and thirsting for God, his father and hungering and thirsting for righteousness.
[time=519] And then last week, Steve Webster talked to us about mercy and how Jesus was and is merciful.
[time=526] I think it's important for us to remember that Christ is mercy.
[time=529] And then this week, purity and heart like Hebrews says, Jesus was without mistake.
[time=536] He was without sin, without blemish.
[time=539] Jesus was all together, pure in heart.
[time=542] I'm so thankful for what Steve mentioned last week.
[time=545] I don't know if you caught this but he said that these beatitudes aren't about what we're supposed to be doing.
[time=551] These beatitudes are about who we are to be.
[time=555] And as I've processed this this week, I think it's important for us to see the person of Christ as being these things because we get to be filled with the nature of God by his Holy Spirit, the person of Christ gets formed in us and we get to be these things that we're learning as we grow in him.
[time=574] But then also I thought about how it's really important for us to consecrate ourselves to him daily.
[time=581] And so this morning I'm gonna invite you to stand again and we're gonna sing Take My Life and Let It Be.
[time=586] Please do that now.
[time=588] And we're gonna sing about consecrating all of who we are to God, our hands, our feet, our finances, our mouths, our songs, our thoughts.
[time=599] We wanna give it all to God and ask him to transform us into the likeness of his Son, Jesus.
[time=605] Let's sing this together.
[time=607] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 250 seconds]
[time=865] - Well, I wanna say welcome to everybody.
[time=868] It's great to see all of you and what a privilege to be able to gather together.
[time=872] Again, I know most of you in the room never take it for granted.
[time=877] And I know I don't and I know how thankful I am.
[time=881] As I've said to you in recent weeks, there's something about gathering.
[time=884] There's something about seeing your face again.
[time=886] There's something about being together in the same room.
[time=889] You having had the week that you've had and me having had the week that I've had.
[time=893] Learning what we've learned being exposed to what we've been exposed to fighting hard for the faith.
[time=900] Sometimes doing well, sometimes not doing so well at the end of the day to be able to come and gather, to bring our hearts and our lives just as they are before him to be able to, as a family, confess our sin, bring our hearts and lives again to the powerful word of God, to be able to worship Him in spirit and truth.
[time=925] It's a sweet thing.
[time=931] Well, I want to say welcome to all of you.
[time=934] I got to just up front say that this is a special Sunday.
[time=938] I found out, I think yesterday, or it was Friday, and some very, very good friends of ours and some folks that are very dear to this family, Keith and Catherine Moore.
[time=949] I think they've got about 15 kids.
[time=951] I don't know how many kids they've got.
[time=953] Maybe seven or nine, I forget.
[time=956] They got a lot of kids, but I found out that Pastor Keith and Catherine's whole family, all their kids were going to be here today.
[time=964] I wasn't sure what the celebration was.
[time=968] I don't know what the event is that brought them all together, but I just knew, because I know Keith and Catherine, how much that meant to them, what a special day this would be to have all their kids here in the service with them.
[time=979] I think Keith told me there's actually 34 of them right over here in this section.
[time=984] So anyway, I'm getting dressed this morning to come to church.
[time=987] And I've got this really sweet, brand new golf shirt that I'm just getting ready to put on.
[time=994] I had been looking forward to wearing this golf shirt today, all week.
[time=998] It was going to be a little hot.
[time=1001] So I'm getting ready to slide this nice, sweet way.
[time=1004] I wish you could see it.
[time=1005] It's the nicest golf shirt you've ever seen.
[time=1007] And as I'm putting the golf shirt on, I think God gets me to think about Catherine Moore, who always says to me, "Please, please, would you wear a coat and tie." So this morning, I wear a coat and tie in honor of Keith and Catherine Moore and their 34 family members.
[time=1024] (applause)
[time=1032] And I'm absolutely sweating my brains out up here.
[time=1035] There's things about to choke me.
[time=1037] And it's all Catherine's fault.
[time=1041] You're welcome.
[time=1043] I love you.
[time=1044] All right.
[time=1045] Open your Bibles, if you would, to Matthew chapter 5, as we continue in our series, God wants you happy.
[time=1054] And I want to remind you of that.
[time=1055] It's been about seven weeks.
[time=1057] And I want to just remind you where we're coming at on this thing, where we're coming from.
[time=1060] God wants you happy.
[time=1062] As somebody picks up the book of Matthew, you begin to read in chapters 5, 6, and 7.
[time=1068] This thing called the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1070] You realize in these first several verses of chapter 5 that again and again and again, Jesus says to these people, gathered on that hillside that day, blessed are the poor in spirit.
[time=1081] Blessed are those who mourn.
[time=1083] Blessed are the gentle.
[time=1085] Blessed, blessed, blessed, he says.
[time=1088] And that word macarias in the Greek, we've talked about it in recent weeks.
[time=1092] It means my friends happy.
[time=1093] It means a blissful contentment of the soul.
[time=1097] It's talking about a depth of happiness and peace and joy and fulfillment that God wants you to have.
[time=1107] Now, you and I, and maybe not necessarily you and I, but more so culture and the enemy, has completely redefined happiness in our day.
[time=1116] Happiness in this culture, happiness in our society now is closely related to things such as pleasure and lust and personal satisfaction and being fulfilled.
[time=1129] And God says, you know what, time out, wait a minute.
[time=1132] I want you happy, but we need to think this through on my terms.
[time=1136] We need to think this through by virtue of my definition.
[time=1139] And God gives us this definition of real happiness here in this passage that's been called the Beatitudes,
[time=1150] Matthew 5.
[time=1151] And let's just pick it up.
[time=1152] Matthew 5, verse 1, if you would stand this morning in honor of God's word, Matthew 5, we'll just go verses 1 to 8.
[time=1162] When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and after he sat down, his disciples came to him and he opened his mouth and began to teach them saying, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Happy are those who mourn, blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[time=1182] Happy are blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
[time=1193] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
[time=1196] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[time=1206] D. Martin Lloyd-Jones, one of the great biblical scholars and commentators of our day said this.
[time=1214] It was astounding and amazing to read it as I sat and looked at it just a couple of weeks ago with regard to this verse, Matthew 5, 8.
[time=1223] He said, "We come now to what is undoubtedly one of the greatest utterances
[time=1229] to be found anywhere in the whole realm of Holy Scripture.
[time=1234] Greatest utterances found anywhere in all of Scripture.
[time=1239] Anyone who realizes even something of the meaning of the words, blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God can approach them only with a sense of awe and of complete inadequacy."
[time=1255] Let's pray, Father God, we stand before you this morning, God, with that sense of awe.
[time=1263] And that sense, God of complete inadequacy.
[time=1267] We stand before you, God, this morning broken and frail humans
[time=1273] who in our humanness, God, and in our sinfulness again come to you begging for mercy, and God the privilege of clarity as it relates to your word.
[time=1282] We realize, God, we know, that there are words of truth, words of life, here in what we're about to read and study and get thought to this morning, and we pray, God, that your spirit would do what we cannot, that your spirit would bring wisdom, that your spirit would bring clarity, that your spirit would bring conviction.
[time=1302] God, that your spirit would outline for us in our minds and hearts this morning as we take in this truth, God, not only an understanding of it, but God that your spirit would help us apply it, that your spirit would give us direction, that your spirit would give us help in the days to come.
[time=1321] God, we want to be a pure in-heart people.
[time=1325] We want desperately to see you.
[time=1328] And so, God, as we come before you this morning, we pray for your help and your assistance.
[time=1333] Thank you, God, for the privilege of being together in this place in your son's day, and we pray.
[time=1339] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1342] My friends, let me say to you again what I've said to you in recent weeks on a number of different occasions, and I'm going to have to say it to you again today, because it is so appropriate and so applicable for us.
[time=1353] Context, context is so important whenever you study God's Word, whenever you read God's Word, whenever you study God's Word, whenever you in your small group, or you in your class, or whatever it is that you take in the scriptures, whatever setting that might be so important that as you read it, you understand and take in not only the words themselves, but that line or those two or three lines, but the context surrounding those two or three lines.
[time=1384] I've said to you how important it is.
[time=1386] I want to just give you a couple of examples this morning as we start, because as we come to Matthew 5.8, let me tell you, context is huge.
[time=1393] But let's just make sure we understand what we mean by context.
[time=1396] Here's an example.
[time=1397] 1 Corinthians 9, 24.
[time=1399] Many of you maybe have heard this. Some of you in the room maybe have memorized this.
[time=1402] Anybody who just sees this verse, I'm sure would glean or get some sense of understanding or even motivation or inspiration from it. Paul says, in 1 Corinthians 9, 24, he says, "Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize?
[time=1421] Run in such a way that you may win." Paul says to the church at Corinth.
[time=1428] Now you and I can hear that. You and I can read that, and we think, okay, I get it, the Christian life, a race, I got to run, I got to keep at it.
[time=1436] That's good. But when you understand the context, the context being that in Corinth, every couple of years they hosted what was known as the Isthemian games.
[time=1450] The Isthemian games, they were the pinnacle of all athletic competition in that day.
[time=1458] Everyone in the then known world came to Corinth to compete in the Isthemian games. It was huge.
[time=1466] It dominated the games. It was like the Olympics of that day.
[time=1470] And it dominated that city. It dominated their culture.
[time=1474] It dominated their economics and their politics.
[time=1478] I mean, it was all about the games. They're in Corinth.
[time=1482] And so when Paul says, "Run a race," whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, everybody there knew about the race.
[time=1490] He was now speaking a language that they clearly understood because of the context of their day. Make sense?
[time=1498] Woman at the well. Think about that for a second. Look on the screen, John chapter 4. Many of you know the story of the woman at the well. Jesus there tired and thirsty. His disciples have gone into town to try and get some food and bring it back. As Jesus sits at the well, this woman comes to the well and he has this insightful unbelievable dialogue with her. Partway through the dialogue, here's what I want you to see. Jesus answered verse 10 and said to her, "If you knew," he says to her, they're having this discussion about life and meaning and fulfillment. And he says, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, give me a drink," because Jesus had asked her for a drink of water from the well.
[time=1542] You would have asked him and he would have given you living water and in the dialogue he goes on to say, "A water where when you drink of it you will never thirst again." You and I can hear that we can go, okay, that makes sense, but the context is absolutely compelling because in the context what you realize about that woman and that well and that community is that she would be one of many women who would walk upwards to two miles three times a day to go and get water and bring that water back to her family to go and get water and bring that water back to that town. They would walk miles and miles three times a day to come and get water and now he's talking about a water that he could give her where she would never thirst again. Now all of a sudden that passage just goes, "Boom, power and application because of the context," it is always so important that you and I understand it and my friends there is some context for our verse here in Matthew 5-8 that is absolutely imperative that we see and understand. These are words that Jesus speaks in Matthew 5-8 that are not spoken out of a vacuum or simply uttered in an effort to impress. No, these are words that emerge out of a historical and religious context which when looked at closely brings great clarity and great insight.
[time=1630] So under the heading of context you might want to just write down a couple of things. First of all, just so you know in that day politically there was some context, Israel had lost its freedom to Rome. We talked about that a few weeks ago. Economically there was some context in coming under Roman rule. Israel was struggling greatly under exorbitant Roman taxation so they're struggling politically. They're struggling economically.
[time=1654] Spiritually though, and this is where I want you to focus in on today.
[time=1658] Spiritually there is some context here that you've got to see.
[time=1662] Israel was spiritually in grave danger.
[time=1666] Israel was spiritually experiencing the oppression of religion thanks to the Pharisees and the Sadducees who had so misconstrued true faith. From the spiritual side the people of Israel were burdened by the oppressive authority of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The Pharisees were the dominant religious leaders of the day. They had misinterpreted the law of Moses as a legal code which if followed could attain salvation for those giving themselves to it.
[time=1702] They had in addition to the law of Moses added a myriad of other hundreds and hundreds of laws and rules and ordinances and regulations that really imposed nothing more than a relentless rigid system of duties on the people which really were impossible for them to perform. Consequently the people who were under this religious leadership were unable to live up to the expectations or the requirements of these leaders that left the people feeling oppressed, that left the people feeling frustrated, that left them feeling guilty and quite frankly worried. You say worried about what?
[time=1742] Well it left them worried about their salvation.
[time=1746] Side note here that is exactly that is exactly what religious systems do.
[time=1754] Anytime you ever bump in, I promise you this. Anytime you ever bump into a religious system a religious system. Anytime you ever bump into anybody who says to you in whatever words if you're going to get to God, if you're going to get to ultimate fulfillment, if you're going to get here you've got to do this, you've got to do this, you've got to do this, you've got to do that, you've got to perform, you've got to match up, you've got to measure up, you've got to do, do, do. That's religion. And anytime you bump into a religious system you're going to bump into scared people worried people who know down deep in their gut that they're not matching up. This is exactly what was going on with the Pharisees. People worried about their efforts not being enough thanks to the Pharisees. Jesus, first hour I said he had no love for the Pharisees and I got to be careful of it because I think Jesus loved them. Jesus was really really really angered by what they were doing. And you see that anger that holy discontent in Matthew 23, they had so missed the boat. Look at Matthew 23, 25.
[time=1834] Turn there if you would. Here you just get a glimpse of how he felt about these guys. In Matthew 23, Jesus says woe to you, woe to you, Matthew 23, verse 25, six, seven and eight.
[time=1850] He says, it's a powerful phrase. You want to know how deeply Jesus felt about the misdirection that these leaders had given spiritually to his people, woe to you, translated would be, beat would be be damned. Be damned, he says, to these false religious leaders. You scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence. You blind Pharisee, blind Pharisee, blind people can't what? We'll come back to that.
[time=1890] We'll come back to that. You blind Pharisee first clean the inside of the cup and the dish so that the outside of it may become clean also. Woe to you, verse 27, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like white washed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. So you too, verse 28, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
[time=1926] You know what else? I think they were full of these religious leaders.
[time=1934] I think they were full of the very same thing that the people were full of.
[time=1942] The people were full of fear that they weren't matching up.
[time=1946] It always happens in a religious system. I think the leaders were full of fear. And let me show you an example if I can of that. Look at John chapter 3.
[time=1958] It may be a story that you're familiar with. Look at John chapter 3 verses 1-3.
[time=1962] We bump into a guy named Nicodemus. Do you know who Nicodemus was?
[time=1966] Do you understand the role that Nicodemus played? Nicodemus was in that day as it relates to the Pharisees and those religious leaders in that time. Nicodemus was the man. Nicodemus was the teacher. He was one who was in that setting, in that culture of religious leaders. He was viewed as one of the highest in stature, one of the brightest. He was considered one of the rulers of the Jews. This guy, for all intents and purposes, had his act together. And he was right there at the top of this religious system. But he comes in John chapter 3 verse 1. Look what it says. It says, "Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[time=2010] And it says in verse 2, "This man came to Jesus by night." You'll note that phrase there by night. He didn't come to Jesus at night because the line was shorter. You understand?
[time=2022] He didn't come to Jesus at night because he thought maybe at night he could have some quality time. No, he comes at night because he's embarrassed. He comes at night because he doesn't want to be seen.
[time=2034] He comes at night because if the other Pharisees or the other Sadducees knew that he was coming to speak to this great rabbi, his name would be trashed. His reputation would be diminished.
[time=2046] So he comes at night. Why? Because there's something, why does a guy like Nicodemus come at night?
[time=2054] Something's going on inside of him. Now watch this.
[time=2058] I don't know if I ever really saw it like this in days gone by. Maybe you have, but a lot of you are smarter than me so it wouldn't surprise me. But watch what happens here. Look at verse 2.
[time=2070] He comes at night and says to him, "Rabbi, we know that you have come from God in the future, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him." Okay, that's what Nicodemus says. You see it there?
[time=2082] Okay, now look what Jesus says. Verse 3.
[time=2086] Jesus answered and said to him.
[time=2090] Okay, wait a minute.
[time=2094] Jesus answered. You give an answer when someone asks, so what?
[time=2098] Okay, go back to verse 2.
[time=2102] Is there a question there? Yes or no?
[time=2106] Say it out loud. I see you're so much smarter than I was.
[time=2110] I always kind of thought Nicodemus asked a question because I knew Jesus gave him an answer. It's an answer that we've all quoted for years and years and years that a man must be what? Born again.
[time=2122] But then you go back to chapter 2 and you realize the guy never asked a question.
[time=2126] And he didn't ask the question outwardly that Jesus answers outwardly in verse 3. So guess what happened there? What happened was that Jesus in all of his divinity. Jesus with all of his sovereignty.
[time=2142] Jesus with all of his insight. He peers right into this guy's heart. And though the guy said something else Jesus knew he was asking this.
[time=2154] And Nicodemus comes to Jesus.
[time=2158] Conscious I believe of his sin.
[time=2162] Conscious of his guilt and his unworthiness. And he didn't want to miss the kingdom. Jesus answered and said to him truly truly I say to you unless one is born again he cannot say it out loud.
[time=2178] Cannot see the kingdom.
[time=2182] He came asking. Oh he didn't say it.
[time=2186] But all was he feeling it.
[time=2190] He came asking the one nagging question that was most certainly in the hearts and minds of those gathered on that hillside that day. A question I'm sure some in this room this morning some watching on the broadcast are asking.
[time=2206] A question that I hear again and again as I sit and meet with people.
[time=2210] How can I be saved?
[time=2214] How can I be saved from my failure and my sin?
[time=2218] How do I make it into God's kingdom? How can I be guaranteed eternal life with God in heaven? In the end everybody's asking the same question.
[time=2230] How can I what? How can I see God? How can I see God? So here watch this.
[time=2238] Here Jesus on the hillside speaks into all of that context. All of that pharisaical stuff. All of that people of Israel stuff. All of that skewed picture that creates all that fear and all those questions and Jesus says you want to know how to see God you're going to have to have a pure heart. You've got to have a pure heart.
[time=2266] A pure heart by definition it would mean a completely clean righteous and unblemished heart. That's what he means when he says only the pure in heart will see God. He means only those whose hearts are completely and by heart. By heart we mean the deepest part of who you are. The heart is the deepest part of the human soul.
[time=2290] The soul, the mind, the will and the emotions. He says the only way you get to see God is when that heart is completely clean righteous and unblemished. Now this would have baffled this would have baffled many in that day and quite frankly it's problematic for a lot of us in this room this morning because we all tend to measure ourselves up against two. We all tend to when the rubber meets the road when we get right down to it we all tend to measure ourselves up against two. God or each other. Say it out loud each other. I mean if I just went around this room right now and I could I mean as I just eyeball you I could just I could go around and just you know call on a friend or two I see some folks in here who own businesses and I could ask you about your business and we could begin the dialogue and within two to three minutes with just a few probing questions about your business and how it's going you would most likely verbally outwardly say something if not outwardly you would certainly inwardly be thinking and the outward or the inward would have to do with how you're stacking up against the other guy against the competitor it's just how we are we measure ourselves for the most part against others. I could talk to parents or even kids in the room about your grades in school by the way how excited are we at school starts in less than 30 days. That's battering of applause I could talk about grades and you could tell me what your grades were but see not long into that discussion we'll start talking about or you'll start thinking about where you stand in your class are you in the middle of your class are you at the top of your class what kids are you better than with your grades what kids are you worse than with your grades where do you match up with an A, B, C or D but really when it gets right down to it we just measure ourselves up against each other we're always doing it. I could talk to people and hear about personal wealth we could talk to people in this room this morning about talent how talented you are in this or that and you would begin to like I would begin to measure ourselves up against each other morality I could begin to ask you really really
[time=2440] honest probing questions about your moral life
[time=2446] and what you've been thinking and clicking on and watching and fantasizing about and I mean we could get in some really really personal stuff and as I ask those questions or as you ask me those questions you know inevitably though we probably wouldn't do it in here outwardly inwardly we start doing this and inside we're thinking
[time=2479] wow I'm not as bad as him my kids aren't as bad as bad as shape as theirs are least we've got our act together more than
[time=2495] they do it sounds so crass it sounds so heartless and it's so you and so me and we do it all the time and the Pharisees back to context the Pharisees did it all the time they did this to compare themselves with others and assess themselves to be better than others and therefore acceptable to God see how whacked that is the reddit guy this week he wrote about the Pharisaical approach he said it kind of works like this when you compare yourself to someone else you feel better than someone below you and the one below you will then find someone below him so he can feel better about himself and the one below him will find someone below him to compare himself with so he can feel better about himself and it just keeps cascading downward descending until finally the standard is the most sinful person how's that and it just keeps descending and if you're better than him you might be okay so if you do it on the human level then the highest standard is the worst person but that's not how it works my friends with God with God it's not the lowest person
[time=2573] that we are compared to it's who it's who it's God it's God God God sets the bar at his own level it's not the lowest person it's the highest and holiness holiest person he sets the bar at his own level and that level listen that level is an absolutely pure perfect unblemished heart so here's how it works and I know this is pretty simple and I know I could probably just leave it at that but maybe just a visual helps us maybe dial it in and hang on to it so many times in our humanness right we want the bar and we're great with the bar being right there and we're great in our humanness as we think about pleasing and being acceptable to God okay with the bar being right there because again all I got to do is look around this room and I'll find somebody who I've outmatched who I've out performed who I can out do this and out do that and spiritually you know we can start to feel pretty good about ourselves with the old bar right there and the sad truth is that there are so many of us that live life somehow with this is the picture and it leads to nothing but pharacyical pride and a blindness that keeps us from seeing who and what God says is wait a minute he said that's not the that's not the standard God says if you're talking about acceptance for me God says if you're talking about entrance into the kingdom how am I doing up here and I'm doing all this just for a visual I can kind of like see the balcony now. How are you doing?
[time=2687] Look at that. I'm not going to go down again here and show you where we were a few minutes ago but God says you know what wait a minute this is the standard and I don't know how many great athletes we got in the room I don't know who might be game but if somebody wants to come up here and take a jump you can give it a shot you know take a try do your very best to measure up but it's not going to happen. This is the standard God says I love you. God says I made you and I want to live in rich relationship with you. He says I want you happy macarias come and live with me in a life that I designed for you to live and the only way you're ever going to get there he says is with a pure heart because that's the only way you're ever going to see me and this is the standard a pure heart and the point that we make here is this you don't I don't nobody in the room earns a pure heart nobody in the room merits a pure heart nobody in the room performs at such a level as to deserve a pure heart you just can't do it it's not ever going to happen because pure hearts aren't merited pure hearts are given
[time=2765] they're given acts acts 15 I think is the is the passage I want you to look at it's up on the screen acts 15 8 I think it's acts 15 8 and 9
[time=2779] I love what it says here it says in God who knows the what say it out loud when God who knows the heart is justified to them giving them the Holy Spirit just as he also did to us and then look what it says in verse 9 and he made no distinction between us and them cleansing there it is purifying their hearts by what say it out loud when by faith you come to Christ when by faith you surrender your heart and life to him your heart gets purified it is the pure heart of Christ in you it is the work of Christ that cleanses you not the work of you you might want to write these down Proverbs like a Proverbs right down Proverbs 29
[time=2833] Proverbs 20 verse 9 it says who can say Proverbs 20 verse 9 who can say I have cleansed my heart I am pure from my sin who can say that anybody? You can write down Job 14 Job 14 4 who can make the clean out of the unclean he just puts it pretty bluntly no one who can make the clean out of the unclean it doesn't work so in this one be attitude Jesus answers the question who gets saved who gets to see God only the pure in heart for they alone measure up to God standard what an amazing thought first major point here I want you to get really the major point of the morning I want to send you off with one more point but look at this the first major point I want us to understand is that possessing a pure heart is how we see God in the eternal sense in the eternal sense possessing a pure heart is how we see God and it is only through God's gift through faith in his son Jesus Christ that we can ever possess that pure heart so God I believe it's safe to say once you eternally happy but I think it's also safe to say and I want to make sure you catch this I don't want you to miss this today I think it's also safe to say that God wants you happy today if we define happiness the right way I think it's okay for us to say that he also wants you deeply happy today and guess how you and I get to experience that happiness today when our hearts are what pure when today so you see there's this positional you can write that down it's positional doctrinally we say sometimes that there are positional truths things that God has done they are realities that he has accomplished they are true because they're true positionally if you've come to faith in Christ you've got a pure heart and you're happy and eternally in the bigger scheme of things you're gonna get to see who God.
[time=2977] Malvo while that's positionally true there is sanctification all truth sanctification all purity of heart it's a big word but let me just say it in layman's terms there's this opportunity in Christ to be pure in heart daily sanctification as we work out and grow in our relationship with him now with just a few minutes here's and I was thinking about this all week you know this is the point where I think it's really really important what you take away from this because as it relates to application of today's message as it relates to you and I now leaving this place and pursuing daily purity of heart I wonder where your mind goes I mean in some ways this is the point in the message where we start talking about where you shouldn't go and what you shouldn't do and what websites you shouldn't visit and how you shouldn't hold love from your husband and how husbands should love their wives and how you kids should stop talking disrespectfully to your parents right here is where we oftentimes will go to some of the things that we connect with purity of heart and I would say to you all stop doing those things or start doing those things and go go be pure in heart and I don't think that that's all together bad but the more I thought about it and the more I prayed about it and the more I just got to give me something here to help all of us with this the more he brought me back to some very very fundamental truths that I'm going to again encourage you with I just was racking my brain how can a father how can a mother how can a young man or a woman keep his way pure and Psalm 119 you know didn't take long it just came right to the forefront of my mind and I want you to see this Psalm 119 9 how can a young man keep his way pure well we can talk about the things that a young man shouldn't go and do but I'd rather back up a step and talk about what it is that young man or young woman old man or old lady I think I covered us all right there what can we give ourselves to that can keep us from deter us from those things instead of me just saying don't do it look what God's word says how can a young man keep his way pure by keeping it according to your what to your word look what it says in verse 10 in verse 10 it says with all my heart David the Psalmist says with all my heart I have sought you this whole hearted seeking of God in this movement toward purity is connected to what do not let me wander from your word look what it says in verse 11
[time=3155] your your word he says I have treasured in my heart that I might not be impure that I might not sin your word I have treasured in my heart so I can
[time=3169] maintain purity and not sin against you I would just encourage you this week my friends mom's and dad's I don't know how it's going for you with bringing God's word into the daily routine of your life and your kids lives maybe it's just you as a couple maybe there's a couple kids maybe there's a bunch of kids but I'll tell you what you as a as a mother you as a father together if you're a mom or a dad on your own same thing either way we have an opportunity to bring the great truth the life changing eternity altering truth of the word of God it gives guidance it gives direction it gives hope it brings restraint it brings clarity of thought we have the privilege as parents to put this on display morning noon and night and there are ways that you and I can do that individually I want to ask you how it's going on that you know what when we did the preparation I'll just say this to you when we did the preparation before resurrection Sunday remember we took six weeks and we prepared for the resurrection one of the things we did was many of us in the room we fasted from something well I fasted those six weeks from a number of things one of which was the radio in my car in my truck and I fasted from the radio because truth be told there are times when I listen to the radio and thoroughly and completely enjoy it and it's all good but there are times when I listen to the radio and it's not all good there are times when what I listen to on the radio takes me places mentally I shouldn't go and so I just was trying my best to figure out how to maybe move away from that and so I had this idea and Lori my assistant helped me out and I came up with these verses verse after verse after verse just encouraging me from the scriptures in that direction and we cut them out and she laminated them and I had like these cards in my car and I put them there in the tray and so every day for six weeks when I got in my car I didn't turn on the radio I just picked up my cards and I just read these cards wherever I went almost gotten 10 accidents almost got caught for speeding 20 times my mind was completely distracted but I'm telling you it was just different it's all I can say to you it was completely different in here for six weeks and some of that has been maintained and I'm thankful I'm grateful for what God's done through his word in my sinful heart and I've told you before you and I need to be inundated with it you and I need to be surrounded by it you and I need to be absolutely given to it morning noon and night and when you and I are willing to feed on it I believe it's a powerful powerful tool against impurity. The other thing I want to tell you this morning as we leave is that there have been times you know during those six weeks and there have been times since those six weeks where I've not done well or I've sinned and I've needed to confess and I want to just encourage you with that. I think you and I would experience a greater level of heart purity if you and I were experiencing an increased level of confession because when we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to what cleanse us, purify us and our hearts from all unrighteousness so I know it sounds pretty simple I suppose read God's word and confess your sin but I think that's what I got for you today is to read God's word to meditate on God's word, memorize God's word, share God's word with your kids have God's word in your car, have God's word at your desk, have God's word on your computer screen, have God's word everywhere you go and wherever your sinfulness wins out confess it, confess it again and again and again and again and again and again and again all day long and know that in that confession he gives you and I a pure heart and with that pure heart we get to see who.
[time=3429] And the people agreed and said, amen, would you stand?
[time=3433] Father God we close this morning grateful for the vision that you give us, thankful Father for the opportunity to see into your word and realize God what you require of us, oh God we pray for help, we need help on this and we pray as the week goes by that the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the people of God would be just that for each of us, God the help and the encouragement that we need we pray these things in your son's name, amen.
