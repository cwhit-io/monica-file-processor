[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 431 seconds]
[time=466] - Let's clap for God, you praise Him.
[time=475] (audience applauding) I know we've been standing a while.
[time=482] I'd like to sing one more chorus if you can stand with us.
[time=486] It's fine, but feel free to sit.
[time=488] If you need to sit, sit.
[time=490] I was just reading this morning in second Samuel.
[time=491] David sat before the Lord and worshiped.
[time=495] I'm not opposed to sitting.
[time=496] But I love that verse that we just sang, let every kindred every tribe on this terrestrial ball.
[time=503] That's my prayer this morning, that every kindred in every tribe would crown Jesus, Lord of all, that His truth would be known, that He would continue to be the peacemaker that He is, and that He would make peace with the nations.
[time=518] Let's just sing one more chorus together, exalting Christ, and lifting His name together, sing, "We Will Crown Him King Forever."
[time=527] [MUSIC - 98 seconds]
[time=628] [AMEN]
[time=638] - Hi, I'm Kevin, and I'm a computer analyst.
[time=647] I work for a small company.
[time=649] We provide IT services for doctors' offices, and I mentor and train some of the staff.
[time=654] Through my church, I lead a small group in my neighborhood.
[time=657] For the past three years, we've met every Friday night, and I love these guys, and we are doing life together.
[time=664] In 2005, my wife and I attended the Leadership Summit for the first time, and I was blown away by all the different speakers, the content, the leadership styles and the techniques that I was exposed to.
[time=675] I keep coming back to the Leadership Summit because with the new content and new speakers every year, I know I'm gonna walk away with something that I can use right now, whether it's at work or with my ministry.
[time=686] I wanna keep growing in my leadership because every Friday night, there's a small group of people who are looking to me to leave.
[time=695] (dramatic music)
[time=712] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 206 seconds]
[time=937] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 31 seconds]
[time=975] (gentle piano music)
[time=995] (gentle piano music) - Would you pray with me?
[time=1006] - Father in Heaven, we worship you
[time=1014] for making peace with us.
[time=1022] We praise you for being the prince of peace who came into the world to live a perfect life in the body of Jesus.
[time=1036] And we praise you Christ for going to the cross
[time=1042] and being persecuted and killed innocently
[time=1051] so that your spilled blood could wash away the sins of me and of us and of generation upon generation of guilty humans.
[time=1062] We pray that your spirit of peace would give us the opportunity to play the role of peace-maker
[time=1073] in situations that you bring our way.
[time=1076] To the praise of your glory, and to worship you for the great sacrifice that you made on our behalf to make peace with us.
[time=1087] Let me pray this in Jesus name, amen.
[time=1092] - Well, good morning, everybody.
[time=1099] I felt many times these last couple of months as though I get to come up and speak again the sermon that's already been preached in music and as Corbett and Matthew have talked with us this morning, I feel very much as though I'm going to reiterate to speak again what's already been said.
[time=1118] So I'm delighted to have the opportunity to do it this morning.
[time=1121] Kelly is not here today.
[time=1123] I was not here last week.
[time=1124] I listened to Kelly on my iPod, traveling around the Midwest this past week, talk about how he wore a suit last week in honor of some guests.
[time=1135] And so my parents and my grandmother are here from Florida this morning, they're right down here.
[time=1140] Say hello, stay up guys, go ahead.
[time=1142] Larry and Patty Webster and my grandmother Maybell Roy.
[time=1145] So I am wearing a suit for them today.
[time=1150] My mom likes that, I think.
[time=1154] It's very easy to get ahead of ourselves when we're talking about the Beatitudes.
[time=1160] And I want to take a moment.
[time=1161] We've prayed many times this morning.
[time=1163] I'd like to pray with you again.
[time=1165] My prayer will be Psalm 85.
[time=1168] And just to quiet our hearts again and remember the good things that God has done for us.
[time=1174] If you have the study guide that you've been given from the church these last few months together, this is one of the readings from this past week.
[time=1183] And I found it a very appropriate prayer to begin our time with this morning.
[time=1187] So let me read this prayer with you.
[time=1189] If you want to follow along with your Bibles as I pray it as our prayer, you're welcome to do so.
[time=1193] If you'd like to listen as I read and pray, that's fine too.
[time=1197] Please pray with me.
[time=1199] Lord, you were favorable to your land.
[time=1204] You restored the fortunes of Jacob.
[time=1207] You forgave the iniquity of your people.
[time=1211] You covered all their sin.
[time=1212] You withdrew all your wrath.
[time=1215] You turned from your hot anger.
[time=1218] Restore us again, O God of our salvation.
[time=1222] And put away your indignation toward us.
[time=1225] Will you be angry with us forever?
[time=1228] Will you prolong your anger to all generations?
[time=1233] Will you not revive us again that your people may rejoice in you?
[time=1238] Show us your steadfast love, O Lord, and grant us your salvation.
[time=1243] Let me hear what God, the Lord, will speak.
[time=1247] For he will speak peace to his people, to his saints.
[time=1250] Let them not turn back to folly.
[time=1253] Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him that glory may dwell in our land.
[time=1260] Stead fast love and faithfulness meet.
[time=1264] Righteousness and peace kiss each other.
[time=1268] Faithfulness springs up from the ground and righteousness looks down from the sky.
[time=1274] Yes, the Lord will give what is good and our land will yield its increase.
[time=1281] Righteousness will go before him and make his footsteps away.
[time=1287] Father, I pray this morning would not be Steve Webster's teaching time, but that the Lord would speak.
[time=1293] You would speak to us, Father, as the Psalmist prays here.
[time=1297] We offer these things to you, Lord, in Jesus' name.
[time=1301] [AMEN] On the screens before you, behind me, is gonna be a responsive reading.
[time=1309] We don't do that very much in church anymore.
[time=1311] Responsive, you guys remember those from years and years ago, responsive readings where I say you say, I like that.
[time=1317] So we're gonna try it this morning.
[time=1318] From first John three, verse one, we'll do it maybe a couple more times in the service if I'm feeling it, if I feel like we're getting it.
[time=1327] We'll do it maybe a couple more times.
[time=1330] Before I do so, I wanna be very careful.
[time=1332] Last week, we did communion.
[time=1334] Is that right?
[time=1335] I wasn't here.
[time=1336] There's a very appropriate warning in the scriptures about communion and about who should and who should not partake of communion.
[time=1345] And I won't go into that this morning, but it's in the scriptures and I would invite you to take a look for it yourself as to who should and should not partake in the very, very same way.
[time=1354] From first John chapter three, I say this to you.
[time=1358] The second part of first John chapter three, verse one, is, and so we are.
[time=1365] The children of God, behold what manner of love the Father has given unto us.
[time=1371] You don't know that chorus.
[time=1373] That we should be called the children of God.
[time=1375] And the last part of the verse says, and so we are.
[time=1379] And this morning, if you're here and you are God's child, say those four words with enthusiasm and so we are.
[time=1388] There is a lie and I'll call it what it is.
[time=1392] It's a harsh word, I know that, but it's true.
[time=1395] There is a lie in the world that says that we're all, all of us are God's children.
[time=1401] The uncomfortable truth is that that is not the case.
[time=1407] That I am by nature a child of wrath.
[time=1411] God made each one of us.
[time=1414] He's responsible for us in that capacity, but if we're gonna go that far, we should say that I'm a child of Adam and Adam fell.
[time=1424] And the disastrous consequences of sin entered the world because of Adam and Eve's sinfulness.
[time=1429] I am their child.
[time=1431] I am not God's child, left to myself.
[time=1434] By nature, I am a child of wrath.
[time=1436] I am a son of disobedience.
[time=1438] So all of us are God's children is just simply not true outside the shed blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=1446] Nobody can be his child.
[time=1448] And so this morning, I invite you, if you are God's child to say those words and so we are within, like a redeemed person would say it.
[time=1458] Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[time=1459] Let's, but that'd be the case this morning.
[time=1462] Here we go.
[time=1463] First John 3-1 says, "See what kind of love the Father has given to us "that we should be called children of God." - So we are.
[time=1475] - Wonderful.
[time=1476] Let's go back and review again.
[time=1478] There's some notes in your bulletin.
[time=1479] If you wanna follow along and fill in the blanks, they're there for you.
[time=1482] I know how much we love to fill in blanks.
[time=1484] They're there.
[time=1485] Please indulge yourself on the blanks.
[time=1487] The first question I have for you this morning is this.
[time=1490] Are you a disciple?
[time=1491] The very beginning of the sermon on the Mount, Jesus says the disciples, it says there, the disciples gathered to Him.
[time=1499] He tells them all these things.
[time=1502] All these things are for the disciples.
[time=1503] They're not for just anyone.
[time=1505] Kelly mentioned that before, it's worth repeating.
[time=1510] There may be two reactions.
[time=1512] In the course of this series.
[time=1515] The first reaction could be what Peter talks about in his letters, about stirring you up by way of reminder.
[time=1521] If you are a child of God this morning, then maybe you've been stirred up by way of reminder about your blessed situation.
[time=1530] Maybe that's been the case.
[time=1531] And so you've been stirred up.
[time=1532] The word for stir up in Peter there, in second Peter one is to wake up, to rouse all parents of children can identify, to rouse children, get up, let's go.
[time=1546] Maybe you've been roused.
[time=1547] Maybe you've been encouraged or stirred up to remember how great your salvation really is.
[time=1553] How great a salvation we have in Jesus.
[time=1558] A great salvation.
[time=1559] Peter says this, therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities.
[time=1565] This is second Peter chapter one verse 12.
[time=1568] Though you know them and are established in the truth that you have, I think it right.
[time=1573] And so do I.
[time=1574] As long as I'm in the body to stir you up by way of reminder.
[time=1578] And so the many of us in the room who are redeemed persons by and only by God's grace, maybe you've been reminded, you've been encouraged in that way.
[time=1586] But maybe you're not a child of God today and you're here.
[time=1590] Maybe you think you are and you're really not.
[time=1593] I was in that place for many, many, many years.
[time=1597] And today you'll have an opportunity to respond to become a child of God, to be born again, to be a new creation.
[time=1606] John Piper preached a sermon on this Beatitude
[time=1612] 22 years ago, I was listening to it last night.
[time=1614] And he said this, it'll be on the screens before you.
[time=1617] This is absolutely my heart for you today.
[time=1620] I want to impress upon your consciences this morning with as much earnestness as I can that in the Beatitudes, Jesus is not making optional suggestions.
[time=1632] And this sermon is not a series of suggestions on how to make the world better.
[time=1637] On the contrary, Jesus is describing the pathway to heaven.
[time=1641] And this sermon is a message from God to urge you to get on that pathway and stay on that pathway so that you will be called sons of God at the last judgment.
[time=1653] That's what's at stake this morning.
[time=1656] If you are on the narrow path, which leads to life, his purpose and mine is to help you stay on it.
[time=1663] And if you are still in the broad way that leads to destruction, our purpose is to direct you to the path of life.
[time=1670] That's my prayer today for this Beatitude.
[time=1672] God has made peace with man to the blood of his son's cross.
[time=1677] And today is your opportunity to respond, maybe for the first time by faith, or to be encouraged to know what manner of love that God has shed upon us by killing his son that you and I should be called his children.
[time=1693] It is overwhelming.
[time=1695] Have we rightly understood this happiness, this macarias that Jesus talks about?
[time=1703] I don't know, my dear, dear friend, Greg Weaver, emailed me this quote a couple of weeks ago.
[time=1708] And I had it in my email and didn't really check it out.
[time=1710] I read it for the first time a couple of days ago.
[time=1712] Really read it, I'll pass it on to you.
[time=1715] This is C.S. Lewis as only he could say it.
[time=1717] This is unhappiness now.
[time=1721] If we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the gospels, not least of which being the children of God, it would seem that our Lord finds our desire, not too strong, but too weak.
[time=1736] We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy, happiness, is offered us.
[time=1747] Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea.
[time=1758] We are far too easily pleased.
[time=1761] Maybe so.
[time=1762] Happiness awaits, friends.
[time=1766] The beatitudes are not a prescription for a better life.
[time=1769] This is not an infomercial by Jesus.
[time=1772] Plug these things in and you'll be better.
[time=1774] You'll feel better.
[time=1776] You'll have more money.
[time=1778] You'll have a better business.
[time=1780] Have you read the beatitudes?
[time=1781] Poor in spirit, morning, meekness, pure in heart.
[time=1787] Today, peacemaking, Kelly has spoken into the situation in first-century Palestine.
[time=1795] A disaster.
[time=1796] The Romans had the Israelites under their thumb and they were loving it.
[time=1801] They made sport of their abuse of the Jewish people.
[time=1806] They crucified them.
[time=1807] There are famous stories of the Roman centurions crucifying thousands of Jews and finding new ways to do it to amuse themselves.
[time=1816] They did align the streets with crosses.
[time=1821] Into that world, Jesus says blessed are the peacemakers and the whole world turns on its head.
[time=1828] What?
[time=1829] Peacemakers, have you read the newspaper?
[time=1832] I can see the objection rising even now.
[time=1836] The second thing I would say, this is just by a quick way of review, is blessed are the merciful.
[time=1841] We'll take a very quick couple of week review here.
[time=1845] We defined mercy two weeks ago as kindness or goodwill toward the miserable and the afflicted, joined with a desire to help them.
[time=1854] Mercy, kindness or goodwill toward people who cannot help you, who are miserable and afflicted, join with a desire to be a help to them.
[time=1865] The children of God friends are merciful people.
[time=1870] And I look at the debauchery around us in our society and I lament just like you.
[time=1877] I say, how can this be?
[time=1880] God, man, it's for so much more than this.
[time=1882] But don't do this to the world.
[time=1885] How dare you be involved in sin?
[time=1887] How could you do that being angry?
[time=1890] If you say stop sinning and never offer them, Jesus, what have you done?
[time=1896] You've enforced a new law on them.
[time=1900] You haven't given them the cross.
[time=1901] Don't do that.
[time=1904] People who are caught in sin friends are just like we used to be.
[time=1908] But we were washed.
[time=1910] First Corinthians chapter six, I'll read these verses with you.
[time=1913] Merciful people see those people caught in sin as those to be pitied, not scorned or rejected or despised, pitied, helped.
[time=1924] Listen to this, first Corinthians six verse nine.
[time=1926] Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit God's kingdom?
[time=1930] Do not be deceived.
[time=1932] Here are all the enemies on the screen before you earlier in the service.
[time=1937] Here's a list.
[time=1938] Sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who practice homosexuality.
[time=1943] Thieves, the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will not inherit, those people not inherit God's kingdom.
[time=1952] And such were some of you.
[time=1957] But you were washed.
[time=1959] You were sanctified.
[time=1960] You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God.
[time=1966] A merciful person sees these people caught in those sins and says, I used to be like you.
[time=1971] But I was washed, but by the grace of God, go I.
[time=1977] Friends, the church needs to be a merciful church.
[time=1981] But mercy is not flabby.
[time=1983] Like D. Martin Lloyd-Jones says, ah, do what you want, and that's okay.
[time=1988] And you'll find your way through it.
[time=1990] Don't worry about it.
[time=1991] I disarmed that if you remember two weeks ago by saying this, that everywhere you go in the Old Testament, God is a merciful God.
[time=2000] And is God flabby about sin?
[time=2002] I think this makes that very much impossible.
[time=2005] God is not flabby about sin.
[time=2008] Jesus became sin.
[time=2011] It says Corinthians.
[time=2014] So that could be washed.
[time=2016] He became, the one who knew no sin became sin overwhelming.
[time=2024] Are you a disciple?
[time=2026] Is the first question.
[time=2027] Second thing I would say by way of review is defining mercy.
[time=2030] And from last week, blessed are the pure in heart.
[time=2033] The word for pure there is katharas, which means free from moral guilt.
[time=2040] Now let me put this together with you.
[time=2041] This is pretty amazing.
[time=2042] I would go so far as to say it's awesome.
[time=2045] It's a very abused word, but I'll say it.
[time=2048] I'll play my hand.
[time=2049] It's awesome.
[time=2051] Pure in heart, what's the promise in that beatitude?
[time=2054] Bless the pure in heart for what?
[time=2056] Let's say it again with enthusiasm.
[time=2059] Bless the pure in heart for, they will see God.
[time=2063] Pure in pure there, the word for pure means free from moral guilt.
[time=2068] Now who among us would not hear that truth and say and be over what takes your breath away?
[time=2077] Free from moral guilt?
[time=2079] My list of guilt is down the street.
[time=2084] It's gone in the person of Christ.
[time=2087] It's gone, pure.
[time=2090] Now beyond that, it says that we'll see God.
[time=2093] Every human heart's longing is unpacked in that beatitude.
[time=2097] Bless the pure in heart.
[time=2098] They will see God.
[time=2100] Wow.
[time=2103] Kelly talked about this very clearly last week and I have the transcript, I read it.
[time=2106] Here's what he said.
[time=2108] He said, the only way you're ever gonna get there, he says, to see him is with a pure heart.
[time=2114] That's the only way you're ever gonna see him.
[time=2117] That's the standard, a pure heart.
[time=2119] The point we make here is this.
[time=2120] You don't, I don't, nobody in here earns a pure heart.
[time=2124] When by faith you surrender your heart and life to him, your heart gets purified.
[time=2131] It's the pure heart of Christ in you.
[time=2133] It's the work of Christ that cleanses you, not the work of you.
[time=2138] Today you're gonna have an opportunity at the end of the service to respond by faith to Christ.
[time=2143] I'll give an invitation to you to ponder your soul's condition.
[time=2150] 16 years ago this September, I bowed the knee to Jesus Christ.
[time=2154] And I was in a church, my parents are here, my grandma this year, I have a very godly heritage in my family, but my pedigree did not save me.
[time=2161] God has no grandchildren.
[time=2166] They're only first generation Christians.
[time=2169] And so I'll give you an opportunity today to respond by faith to Christ.
[time=2172] If you are his child, they'll give you opportunity to pray for strength to face whatever's coming your way this week.
[time=2178] It's not gonna be an easy week for some of you.
[time=2180] I know that.
[time=2181] The God will give you the grace and the peace to face what's in front of you.
[time=2186] Okay, Roman room rule two.
[time=2188] What's a peacemaker?
[time=2190] We have to answer that question.
[time=2191] I'll define it for you letter A this way.
[time=2193] A peacemaker is one who endeavors to reconcile persons who have disagreements.
[time=2205] And the key word there friends is reconcile.
[time=2208] It is a beautiful word.
[time=2210] One of my favorite words as a matter of fact.
[time=2214] Peace indicates completeness and wholeness in every area of life, including your relationship with God, with your neighbor, and with nations.
[time=2225] I'm not gonna go there.
[time=2227] I'm not gonna go the international intrigue United Nations route.
[time=2231] I'm not gonna go there.
[time=2233] I could.
[time=2234] The text took me in a different way.
[time=2236] But I'll say this to you.
[time=2239] You might object and say, well, doesn't God care about war?
[time=2243] Doesn't God care about dictators, oppressing helpless people?
[time=2248] Isn't that important to God?
[time=2250] Isn't international affairs important to God?
[time=2253] Isn't the election important to God?
[time=2255] I would say this to you.
[time=2258] As clearly as I can and as compassionately as I can, of more import to God is your soul than all those things.
[time=2266] All those things.
[time=2269] What good is it to have peace between nations and a bunch of people who aren't redeemed?
[time=2274] What good is that?
[time=2275] If there's no repentance, what good is it?
[time=2279] If we are the greenest people in the world, and we love the environment and we spare it and we conserve and all those fine things, but in our hearts we are wicked.
[time=2290] So what?
[time=2292] White washed sepulchres, Jesus said.
[time=2295] So there you have it.
[time=2297] Let's take a little journey.
[time=2298] I just took a little trip from the prophets in the Old Testament to the gospels to Paul's letter to the Romans.
[time=2305] In Zechariah chapter nine, about 500 years before Christ was born, this prophecy was spoken.
[time=2311] And I offer it to you as a gift.
[time=2315] It is beautiful.
[time=2316] Zechariah chapter nine, verses nine through 12, I read this verse a couple of weeks ago in review talking about meekness and how Jesus is meek.
[time=2326] Listen, rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem, behold your king is coming to you.
[time=2334] Righteous and having salvation is he humble.
[time=2338] Meek, gentle, that's the word there.
[time=2340] And mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the full of a donkey, I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim.
[time=2347] Ephraim there is another way of saying the northern kingdom of Israel and the war horse from Jerusalem.
[time=2354] The battle bow shall be cut off and he shall speak, what?
[time=2359] Peace to the nations, the Gentiles, his rule shall be from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth.
[time=2368] As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit, return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope.
[time=2380] Today I declare that I will restore to you double.
[time=2385] Jesus has begun that rule.
[time=2389] He has a kingdom and you and I, by God's grace, as his children are part of it.
[time=2395] Wow, okay, now Luke 19, Luke 19 is Luke's account of what we all know is the triumphal entry.
[time=2402] And listen carefully to what Jesus says upon this taking place.
[time=2407] Listen carefully, he was drawing near verse 37 of Luke 19.
[time=2411] He was drawing near already on the way to the down the mount of Olives.
[time=2415] The whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying, blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=2427] Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.
[time=2431] Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples." He answered, "I tell you, if these were silent, "the very stones would cry out.
[time=2440] "When he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it." Jesus as mourner, saying, "What that you, even you, had known on this day "the things that make for peace." But now they are hidden from your eyes.
[time=2459] Jesus came to Jerusalem friends to die.
[time=2463] That's why he was entering into Jerusalem.
[time=2467] His triumphal entry was only a triumph insofar as he turned all the leader's expectations over.
[time=2475] We're gonna get rid of him.
[time=2476] We're gonna silence him and the exact opposite took place.
[time=2480] By his crucifixion, by his resurrection, God's ultimate plan for humanity was enacted in the person of his son.
[time=2488] Okay, so Zechariah 9 fulfilled in Luke 19.
[time=2490] Now watch this.
[time=2491] Romans 5, verse one.
[time=2494] Therefore, having been justified by faith,
[time=2501] we have what?
[time=2505] Peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2510] A peacemaker, let her be friends, is absolutely unlike everybody else.
[time=2515] And I wanna read a quote for you from Robert Gulick in one of his books about this whole situation.
[time=2522] Kelly's been talking about this, the situation, the political situation.
[time=2526] Let's just unpack it for just a moment.
[time=2528] The peace intended is not merely that of political and economic stability.
[time=2532] Those things are important to God.
[time=2533] I paid 3.57 for gas last week.
[time=2536] And I was like, whoa, 60 cents less.
[time=2540] I was like, wow, it's amazing.
[time=2542] I'm not a terribly old person.
[time=2544] But I went to college, 1991, and I paid 79 cents a gallon for gas.
[time=2552] That was about 17 years ago.
[time=2555] And my grandma can tell you stories about how much she paid for gas.
[time=2558] Much less than that.
[time=2559] I rejoiced at 3.57 a gallon for gas.
[time=2562] Hard even to imagine that.
[time=2563] Economic stability matters to God.
[time=2567] It does matter to him.
[time=2568] Political stability matters to him.
[time=2571] I believe that, but what matters more?
[time=2572] Listen, the peace intended is not really that of political and economic stability as in the Greco-Roman world, but peace in the Old Testament's inclusive sense of wholeness.
[time=2583] All that constitutes well-being.
[time=2586] The peacemakers, therefore, are not simply those who bring peace between two conflicting parties, but those actively at work making peace, bringing about wholeness and well-being among the alienated.
[time=2599] There are people in every one of our lives who are cut off from God, aliens.
[time=2604] And the best way for you and I to make peace this week is to speak the gospel to them.
[time=2610] The good news.
[time=2611] That Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.
[time=2614] And he saved me.
[time=2617] Not because of my own goodness, because he loved me, why?
[time=2620] I don't know.
[time=2621] It's a mystery, mystery of mercy.
[time=2624] Stephen Chris Chapman said.
[time=2625] Luke 1.79, Zechariah's prophecy spoken over his son,
[time=2632] who would be a prophet for Jesus.
[time=2633] He says this, to give light to those who sit in darkness in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
[time=2642] Jesus is the one who would do that.
[time=2644] And only Jesus.
[time=2649] Friends, today, there is a feeling in the world, and it's out there, it's in the air almost.
[time=2654] There's a feeling that religions are multiple choice.
[time=2658] Wherever you see fit to land on, good for you.
[time=2661] Let me offer you this today to think about for this week.
[time=2665] Consider this.
[time=2668] If you take away Jesus from Christianity, everything goes away.
[time=2674] There is nothing left.
[time=2675] In other systems, I won't name them.
[time=2678] I don't need to.
[time=2679] If you took away their founder, their key figure, and kept their precepts in place, you'd be just fine.
[time=2686] In many circumstances, not so with Christianity, come to a person today, friends, not to a system of teaching.
[time=2694] Just come to me, all you who are weary and heavily burdened, and I will give you rest, Jesus says.
[time=2701] Not my teaching.
[time=2702] My yoke is easy, my burden is light.
[time=2706] Why?
[time=2707] It's Jesus, it's him.
[time=2709] Luke two, let's have Christmas in July.
[time=2714] Can we do that?
[time=2716] We're going to, whether you want to or not.
[time=2717] Luke two, 13 and 14.
[time=2719] Suddenly there was the angel, a multitude of the heavenly hosts, praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on earth, peace among those with whom he is pleased.
[time=2734] They pronounced peace, John 14, 27.
[time=2738] Jesus says, peace, I lead with you.
[time=2741] My peace, I give to you, not as the world gives.
[time=2746] The world gives cheap gas.
[time=2749] That's not real peace.
[time=2751] He gives real peace.
[time=2753] A peacemaker is absolutely unlike everybody else.
[time=2757] It's a curiosity to the world.
[time=2760] Lastly, let us see a peacemaker is a child of the Prince of Peace.
[time=2766] We were been traveling all of the Midwest this past week from here to North Michigan to Detroit to Ohio and then back yesterday, our whirlwind tour of the Midwest.
[time=2775] We're seeing cousins and aunts and uncles and sisters and it was great, it was really, really great.
[time=2781] Well, guess what they all said about our kids?
[time=2784] Oh, it's just like you Steve, it looks just like you.
[time=2788] Chip off the old block, just like you Steve.
[time=2790] I can see in his face, poor kid, looks like me.
[time=2793] We go to Jodi's family in Ohio, my wife Jodi and everyone says, oh, it looks just like you, Jodi.
[time=2800] A child of the Prince of Peace, a chip off the old block
[time=2808] is the person who knows Jesus.
[time=2811] The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace,
[time=2818] friends, it's not the fruits of the spirit, it's the fruit of the spirit, it's a package deal.
[time=2823] When you come to know him, you are given that as a guarantee
[time=2829] of what's to come, the Holy Spirit, living within you, making you a peacemaker, making you poor in spirit, a mourner and all the rest.
[time=2838] I encourage you with those words.
[time=2841] I tell my students, if they're here this morning, my students, I beg their pardon.
[time=2844] The apple trees in my backyard don't strain to produce apples, there's the apple.
[time=2850] Doesn't happen like that.
[time=2853] Sorry about that noise.
[time=2855] The pear tree in my backyard doesn't strain to produce pears, just there it is in season, there's the pear and a child of God doesn't have to strain to look like Jesus, he just does.
[time=2867] Many, many years ago, there was a band called Out of the Grave and have you ever heard of them?
[time=2873] Old school, they had a song called, I want to love like breathing, spontaneous and freely.
[time=2881] Love is like that for a person who knows Jesus.
[time=2885] So there's the question, does that describe us today?
[time=2889] William Alexander Percy, the peace of God makes the peacemaker distinctive, he says this, the castor, nets and galley, just off the hills of Brown, such happy, simple fisher folk before the Lord came down, contented, peaceful fishermen before they ever knew, the peace of God that filled their hearts brim full and broke them too.
[time=2913] Young John who trimmed the flapping sail, homeless and Patmus died, Peter who hauled the teaming net head down was crucified.
[time=2922] The peace of God, it is no peace, but strife closed in the sod, yet brothers, pray for but one thing, the marvelous peace of God.
[time=2935] Peace of God is not like the world offers.
[time=2938] And peace isn't, again, flabby, like, oh, let's not have any problems, it's gonna be okay.
[time=2943] And that's not what he's talking about here at all.
[time=2946] There is a peace that can only be known on the other side of war.
[time=2951] And for you and I, the purchase price of our redemption
[time=2957] was the life of Jesus.
[time=2959] And there is peace and it's real and it's offered to you in him this morning.
[time=2965] But without the cross, friends, there's nothing, there's nothing there without the cross.
[time=2971] The cross should always be front and center to us.
[time=2977] Let's try the response of reading again.
[time=2979] It seems right to do that.
[time=2981] See what kind of love the Father has given to us that we should be called children of God.
[time=2992] Some things to take with you, again, this morning on the way out, Romans 3.
[time=2997] A peacemaker knows the one who is our peace.
[time=3000] Ephesians 2, verse 13 says, but now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off had been brought near by the blood of Christ.
[time=3009] Verse 14, "For he himself is our peace." He himself is our peace.
[time=3015] Colossians 1, 19, "For in him all the fullness of God,
[time=3022] was pleased to dwell, that is Jesus, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace, making peace by the blood of his cross." The one who is our peace, it's a person.
[time=3040] Secondly, a peacemaker is a minister of reconciliation.
[time=3045] Kelly talks about priests that go, and you and I, if we know him, are ministers of reconciliation, that is my responsibility, that is my charge, my call, my response, we have been entrusted with this ministry, says Paul in 2 Corinthians chapter 5, verse 18, "All this is from God, this new creation from verse 17, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, that is that in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, purity.
[time=3081] Note, free from moral guilt, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation, entrusting to us, I have not been forgiven of my sins to have a trophy on my mantle.
[time=3095] I'm going to heaven.
[time=3097] Whew.
[time=3097] God, that's over.
[time=3100] Students, if that's your mentality about your salvation, I beg God that he would change your mind about that.
[time=3107] You have not been set free for yourself only.
[time=3110] You have a ministry of reconciliation in your family, in your school, wherever your feet take you to go.
[time=3116] And so do we.
[time=3117] And our workplaces, anywhere our feet take us, how beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness.
[time=3131] Happiness.
[time=3134] Who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns." Lastly, friends, a peacemaker speaks the truth in love.
[time=3145] Please, please, please, don't only be truthful.
[time=3150] And don't only be loving, be both truthful and loving.
[time=3156] Many churches, many people are very truthful,
[time=3162] extraordinarily truthful, not very loving.
[time=3164] Many are very loving, not so truthful.
[time=3169] We are called to both.
[time=3172] Always be ready, Peter says.
[time=3174] Always be ready to give an answer for what you believe, but do it with gentleness and respect.
[time=3179] So peace making for you and I this morning, first and foremost is speaking the truth, preaching the gospel, proclaiming the truth about you and I, to the world, however it's seen fit to do.
[time=3195] There is a place guys for lifestyle evangelism, for being good example and maybe not saying anything, but if only ever is that we've gone to, we've not gone far enough.
[time=3205] Likewise, I'm very good at speaking.
[time=3209] My love language, Kelly mentioned a couple weeks ago, my love language is words of affirmation.
[time=3214] So guess what I do to Jodi all the time?
[time=3216] I talk to her, oh honey, I love you.
[time=3218] Oh, you're so beautiful.
[time=3220] I believe those things, those things I do love her she is beautiful, but if I never marry my words with my deeds, what is it?
[time=3227] It's nothing, same for us.
[time=3230] Isaiah 57, in conclusion, verse 17.
[time=3238] Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain, I was angry, I struck him, I hid my face and was angry.
[time=3247] He went on back sliding in the way of his own heart.
[time=3250] I have seen his ways, but I will heal him.
[time=3253] I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners, creating the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, to the far and the near, says the Lord, and I will heal him.
[time=3264] Corbin's gonna come and play softly.
[time=3267] I'm gonna read this poem from Oscar Wilde, the same Oscar Wilde that lived a life of complete debauchery.
[time=3274] It talked about him a few weeks ago who died in a pathetic hotel in Paris somewhere.
[time=3279] He was a Christ haunted man.
[time=3281] And at some point in his, he was in and out of dementia, he wrote this poem.
[time=3286] And thus we rust life's iron chain degraded in alone.
[time=3292] And some men curse, and some men weep, and some men make no moan.
[time=3296] But God's eternal laws are kind and break the heart of stone.
[time=3300] And every human heart that breaks in prison, cellar, yard is as that broken box that gave its treasure to the Lord, and filled the unclean leper's house with the scent of costliest nard.
[time=3311] Ah, happy.
[time=3314] Day whose hearts can break and peace of pardon win.
[time=3321] How else may man make straight his plan and cleanse his soul from sin?
[time=3327] How else but through a broken heart may Lord Christ enter in?
[time=3332] Would you buy your heads?
[time=3334] Close your eyes with me this morning.
[time=3335] I am burdened by week after week, the call in my heart to impress upon you the importance of a response.
[time=3345] This morning I invite you to be the person that Oscar Wilde describes, a broken hearted sort of person.
[time=3354] Poor in spirit, I have nothing, Father, nothing to offer you.
[time=3359] If you hear this morning and you don't know him, if you're not his child, I'm inviting you to pray where you are.
[time=3365] Father, I am your enemy.
[time=3370] My sin has separated me from you, and the only way I may know you is through your son Jesus.
[time=3379] So, Father, forgive me of my sin.
[time=3383] Set me on the path of life and give me strength.
[time=3392] Friends, this morning, if you prayed that prayer, to be forgiven of your sins, would you please stay afterwards and see me and talk to me, talk to Matt, Roars, talk to Corbin, someone?
[time=3402] As we dismiss this morning, Father,
[time=3409] I pray your Holy Spirit, we just have room.
[time=3414] Just have room to roam and to seek out your children here who were not children when they walked in the door.
[time=3422] Lord, the many who are before me, your children today, give them strength and grace and peace to go out into the world and be peacemakers, those who speak the truth and love, ministers of reconciliation.
[time=3435] Lord, I pray now that we would do what your son Jesus did when the disciples were afraid, that we would be speakers of peace.
[time=3443] Help us, Father.
[time=3448] I pray that you would breathe life into dead hearts this morning and breathe encouragement into the hearts of your children.
[time=3453] I pray all of this in the name of Jesus, our peacemaker, and all the people of God said.
[time=3459] Go in peace.
[time=3462] (upbeat music)
