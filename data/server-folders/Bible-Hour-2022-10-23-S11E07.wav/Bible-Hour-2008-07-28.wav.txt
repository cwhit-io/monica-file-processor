[time=208] - Well hello again everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour Broadcast.
[time=214] We're so thankful that you're here and so thankful for this time that God gives us together each and every week.
[time=220] For those of you who may be tuning in, my name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege.
[time=224] And it is that, it's an absolute privilege and joy to serve on the team here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=229] And we're so thankful for this chance to share with you from God's Word.
[time=234] That really is the purpose behind the Bible Hour.
[time=237] We gather every week here at Blackhawk.
[time=239] We gather as a family to encounter God, to encounter Him through our worship, to encounter Him through the scriptures and to encounter Him through the fellowship that only He provides and the joy is ours to try and share that experience with you each and every week through this broadcast.
[time=259] And I wanna just remind you, all of you who are watching of this one central theme that you've been hearing for the last seven or eight weeks.
[time=267] We've been in the midst of this study from the Beatitudes in Matthew chapter five.
[time=272] And we've entitled our study, God wants you happy.
[time=276] And I wanna just say this to every one of you listening in today.
[time=280] I know that there are many of you watching and you have experienced true happiness.
[time=286] You understand what it means to be at the soul level, really, really content.
[time=294] You know, because you know the Lord, what it means, to be absolutely and thoroughly satisfied at the deepest level.
[time=302] And I wanna just remind those of you watching who to this point in time, you haven't fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ.
[time=310] You may know about God.
[time=311] You may have been involved in religion over the years, but you know in your heart, you have yet to fully and absolutely surrender your heart and life to a personal relationship with Christ.
[time=325] And I just wanna remind you, you'll never be happy.
[time=329] Happy in the way that God defines it.
[time=332] Now you can have a nice car and you can have a good family and you can have great trips.
[time=338] You can own lots of stuff, but God doesn't define happiness that way culture does.
[time=345] You'll never be satisfied.
[time=347] You'll never ever experience the kind of lasting gratification that God designed you to have until you know and live in intimate relationship with his son.
[time=357] And that's been the message of this series.
[time=360] And I hope as you watch today, I hope you'll open your heart and your mind.
[time=365] Maybe today is the day that as you listen, the spirit of God would move you towards surrendering your heart and life to Christ.
[time=374] If there is anything we can do to help you in that process, if there's someone that you'd like to talk with, if just talking with someone would help you think these things through, if there's questions that you have, please don't hesitate to shoot me personally an email.
[time=389] You can reach me at our website and I can get you in touch with those who could come alongside you in your faith journey and really give you some help and encouragement.
[time=398] God wants you happy.
[time=400] We want you to be satisfied in this life that God has given you.
[time=404] And it's in his son that you and I find that happiness.
[time=408] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=409] Thanks for being a part of our family.
[time=412] And I hope you'll come by sometime and see us.
[time=414] We're grateful for each and every one of you.
[time=416] God bless you.
[time=417] Have a great week.

[time=440] The family of man has an album
[time=446] where our names are written beside our brothers and sisters.
[time=457] The events of our lives fill its pages.
[time=460] The family of man has an album.
[time=468] We're the moments that shape our family's lives are witnessed
[time=474] where sorrows and joys are shared in the pages that bind us together.
[time=486] The family of man has an album.
[time=489] An open record before God and man of how we treat one another.
[time=496] And the chapter now unfolding records more Christians being persecuted than at any time in history.
[time=505] More than 200 million Christians worldwide face persecution
[time=514] only for what they believe.
[time=516] What is our response when our children
[time=524] are sold in the slavery?
[time=525] What do we say when our sisters are raped?
[time=530] When our sons are imprisoned?
[time=533] When our family members are tortured and beaten to death?
[time=546] The family of man has an album.
[time=548] Will it remember this is an age
[time=554] when our family was killed for Christ and we did nothing to help them?
[time=559] We must do what we can
[time=566] and the least we can do is the most we can do.
[time=575] Pray.
[time=576] # When the eye of God and night #
[time=592] # We'll see you clearly # # One day all who deny # # Will finally # # We believe # # One day hearts make a stone # # We'll break in pieces # # And one day chains once unbroken # # We'll fall down # # With your feet # # So we wait # # For that one day # # Come quickly # # We want to see your glory # # Every knee falls down before me # # Every tongue offers you praise #

[time=811] # Oh, sing glory # Do you know what the last words of the Bible are?
[time=828] Do you ever just look at the very last thing that gets said in all of Scripture?
[time=838] Revelation 22 verse 20, "He who testifies to these things"
[time=844] says, "Yes, I am coming quickly."
[time=852] Amen. And John, the apostle there, just adds the very last line, "O Lord Jesus, come.
[time=861] Come quickly." And Father God, we would just echo that prayer this morning.
[time=870] We would with great thanks and with great gratitude in our hearts.
[time=875] God, we would just ask that you would, at the right time and at the right place,
[time=881] we know that's all up to you, that you would come.
[time=884] And in the meantime, Father, we pray that you would give us while we wait.
[time=889] God, the strength to wait well. God, may we serve you while we wait.
[time=895] God, may we give to you while we wait.
[time=898] God, may we love others deeply and patiently while we wait.
[time=905] While we wait, Father, may we be the community of believers that you've called us to be
[time=912] with the willingness, God, to open our hearts and our arms to those in our world.
[time=918] Father God, we love you. We give to you now out of hearts and lives that have been given so much.
[time=925] We give graciously, willingly, happily knowing that even these gifts that we bring today
[time=934] go to those far, far away who face a reality much more difficult than ours.
[time=940] God, thank you for the ministry of this church.
[time=943] Thank you for what these gifts allow to take place.
[time=947] And God, we pray that as we give it, God, we pray that you would be honored in your son's name.
[time=953] [AMEN - 4 seconds]
[time=964] Well, it's good to be together. I do want to say thanks to Steve Webster who was here last week,
[time=975] so very thankful for the opportunity that you had last week with Steve as he continued to take you through this series. I want to say thank you to many of you who over the summer months have
[time=988] continued to in real significant ways. You've rolled up your sleeves around this place. You've given
[time=994] yourselves to two and three and four and five-year-olds. Some of you have helped with our student ministry. There's a handful of folks who have been so active in helping us with our North Campus
[time=1005] Project. I was just over there the other day. I got back from being away on Friday, came by the
[time=1012] office and got to see the remodeling and the refurbishing that's been going on across the street with our school and our offices. And it's just really, really encouraging. And I know there's a number of folks who have been a part of that. And I want to say thank you to them as well.
[time=1026] I'm really thankful for what I see God doing around Black Hawk in recent days and so thankful
[time=1032] to get to be a part of it. And I can't wait for these next couple of weeks as we begin to
[time=1038] prepare for a new season of school, a new season of ministry. So many things to share with you in
[time=1044] the days to come, but we've got some work to do still here as we make our way through this series.
[time=1050] And I'm looking forward to it. Hey, if you brought your Bibles this morning, would you open up to Matthew chapter five and we are going to jump back into our series that we have entitled God wants you happy? We find ourselves here in Matthew five, which as many of you know
[time=1065] is the beginning of Matthew five, six, and seven, the Sermon on the Mount, one of the classic
[time=1071] treatments, one of the classic messages ever given as God allows us to see in a very clear way the
[time=1078] practical everyday implications of what it means and looks like to follow his son, to follow Jesus
[time=1084] Christ. At the beginning of that message in Matthew five, especially in these early verses, we see what has become known as the Beatitudes. And here is where we have come to this place of
[time=1096] realization that God wants you happy. He really does. We've looked at that word blessed, blessed
[time=1103] are the poor in spirit, blessed are those who mourn, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, blessed are the gentle in the meek, blessed, blessed, blessed. We've seen it throughout the entire passage and we learned early on that that word blessed is the Greek word macarias.
[time=1117] It's a word that means happy. It's a word that means deeply happy. It's a word that describes
[time=1123] the deep, joyful, blissful contentment of the soul. And that, my friends, is how God designed
[time=1130] you and I to live life, blissfully content at the level of the soul. God wants you happy and we've
[time=1138] learned that God delivers that happiness. When your heart and life strike a certain posture,
[time=1145] we've had these, these postures for you and I to take over the last eight weeks, we've had these
[time=1151] physical postures as an outward representation of these inward realities. He delivers this happiness
[time=1158] when your heart and life strike a certain posture. You will be macarias blessed when you are poor in
[time=1166] spirit, when you mourn over your sinfulness, when you're gentle, when you hunger and thirst for what's
[time=1172] right, you'll be blessed. You'll be macarias when you are merciful, when you are pure in heart,
[time=1178] when you're a peacemaker. And while all that's true, I think the most important truth we've taught
[time=1184] you so far, the one principle that we must keep in mind is that these postures, the physical
[time=1191] postures, yes, but that internal posture is absolutely impossible for you and I to strike.
[time=1198] We can't strike those postures on our own. No, these postures are not attainable by mere human
[time=1205] effort and you can see this in your note sheet and you can fill this in, this blessedness, my friends, this happiness isn't the result of our efforts. There's nothing we can do in and of
[time=1217] ourselves to strike these postures and then by striking these postures experience the blessings
[time=1223] that come, no, instead it is the result of his grace and his grace alone. This happiness isn't the result of our efforts but instead is the result of his grace. The Beatitudes describe a reality
[time=1236] a happy future, if you will, available only to the redeemed. We saw this, we saw this very important truth at the very beginning of our study in Matthew 5 2. You can go
[time=1248] back to 5 1, if you will, where this whole thing began. Look there with me. Let me just remind you
[time=1255] of this. Matthew 5 1, when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain after he sat down,
[time=1261] his disciples came to him and then here it is in verse 2. He opened his mouth and began to teach them. This entire message is for the disciples. This entire message, this entire series, we've been
[time=1275] in all of these truths that we've hit upon. This is a message for the redeemed and the real,
[time=1282] I think eye opening and significant reality that we stumbled upon early in the series is that it
[time=1288] is that at the end of the day, really when it's all said and done, the only people who ever truly get
[time=1295] to be happy in this life are those that know him. The only people who ever get to really be sad,
[time=1305] I'm not talking about cars and I'm not talking about homes, I'm not talking about trips, I'm not talking about even, you know, I'm not talking about any of those things that culture has defined as the pursuit of happiness. No, we're talking about a contentment, a blissfulness of the soul.
[time=1319] The only people who ever get to experience that are those that have fully surrendered their hearts
[time=1326] and lives to him. Only the saved get the kingdom of God. It makes sense when you look through the
[time=1333] attitudes, when you look at not only the first statement in each verse, but when you look at the second resulting statement in each verse, it really makes sense. Only the saved get the kingdom of God
[time=1344] only the redeemed get comforted, only the redeemed inherit the earth, only the saved are satisfied,
[time=1352] only the saved get to receive mercy, only the saved will in the end see God, only the redeemed
[time=1358] will be called sons of God. The beatitudes are for the disciples. Another fascinating principle
[time=1367] that we've seen at work over these past eight weeks is how one beatitude, and I want you to write
[time=1373] this down, how one beatitude flows into the next. We've seen this all along. From the very beginning
[time=1381] with poor in spirit, we've seen how as we look into one beatitude, sure enough, as we come then
[time=1388] and look at the next beatitude, we see how the two beatitudes are connected. I mean, really simple.
[time=1394] If you go back to the beginning, we learned that when you see your bankrupt spiritual condition,
[time=1401] blessed are the poor in spirit. Those who have a very clear sense of how spiritually and personally
[time=1408] and sinfully depraved we really are, when somebody sees that, when they realize their
[time=1415] sinfulness, they're then ready to next beatitude mourn. Mornin comes right on the heels of one's
[time=1423] realization of their sinfulness. Then one who mourns, we can just keep going, one who mourns,
[time=1429] one who's truly and genuinely remorseful, who sees their sin and has broken over it, broken
[time=1436] that broken remorseful person then is set up to be what, prideful? No, gentle. Blessed are the
[time=1443] gentle, the meek. You with me, we've seen it again and again and again, how one beatitude flows
[time=1450] into the next. Well, this morning, I want you to think back to last week and the beatitude,
[time=1458] Steve Webster, unpacked for you. Blessed are the peacemakers. And with this pattern established of
[time=1465] one beatitude flowing into the next, I want to ask you a question this morning. I want you to be willing just to ask yourself the question. Here it is. What happens to peacemakers?
[time=1479] What happens to people who really give themselves to doing their very, very best to make peace?
[time=1490] If poor in spirit flows into mourning, what does, and if you look at the text, you know the answer,
[time=1501] what does peacemaking flow into? Watch the screens, if you would, just for a moment,
[time=1508] a powerful example of what peacemaking flows into.
[time=1522] I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
[time=1532] cream. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created each other.
[time=1546] I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia,
[time=1556] sons of former slaves, and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together
[time=1564] at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state
[time=1573] sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into
[time=1584] an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live
[time=1596] in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of our skin but by the content of that character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious
[time=1621] races, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and
[time=1628] nullification. One day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able
[time=1635] to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today.
[time=1647] On April 4, 1968, Dr. King stepped out onto the balcony of his motel room in Memphis,
[time=1656] where he had been meeting with Ralph Abernathy, Jesse Jackson, and others.
[time=1660] From across the way, a single shot was fired. Martin Luther King fell dead, murdered at the age
[time=1670] of 39. James Earl Ray was convicted of the murder of Martin Luther King.
[time=1675] Would you stand in honor of God's word, and let me read this to you.
[time=1683] I'll back up to verse 9. What happens to those who try and make peace?
[time=1692] It says in Matthew 5, 9, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
[time=1703] Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the
[time=1709] kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say
[time=1716] all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice," Jesus says, "and be glad for your reward
[time=1725] in heaven is great, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
[time=1736] Father God, we would as a collective group here this morning confess that on this topic of persecution
[time=1742] we stand a bit perplexed. Father, we have been reminded this morning of the sad and disheartening
[time=1752] reality at times, the level of persecution God that those in this world face because of you.
[time=1759] God, there are those in this world that know you. There are fellow brothers and sisters of ours
[time=1765] who are giving themselves so faithfully to you, God, that they are facing imprisonment. They are facing the end of a knife wielded by a terrorist. God, there are those who are being beaten and
[time=1777] even killed. And we admittedly, God, have no concept of what that's like. And yet we read the
[time=1785] very same scriptures that tell us the very same thing, that this is something that should be a
[time=1791] reality, God, that this is something that should be present, that this is something, God, that we should experience. And so we would just humbly and expectantly ask you today, God, to help us
[time=1802] understand how. How in the world to experience the kind of discomfort that we should as we live
[time=1810] our lives, God, the way that we should give us insight and understanding, God, give us courage to apply what we see. And we'll thank you for it in your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=1820] So as you watch the clip there of Dr. Martin Luther King, as you think about others in past
[time=1829] history who have tried to pursue peace, we're really not surprised, are we, that we come to this
[time=1835] be attitude. Peacemakers will be. Peacemakers always have been. Peacemakers are today and
[time=1843] peacemakers always will be in the future persecuted. It's what happens to people who try to bring
[time=1849] peace. It happened to Dr. Martin Luther King, it happened to Gandhi, it happened to Mandela, the ultimate of all examples, our Lord Jesus Christ, it happened to him.
[time=1858] Peacemakers will be persecuted. And here in this passage this morning, two verses really,
[time=1867] verses 10 and 11, we've got them these two verses, we've got one beatitude, three blessings really
[time=1873] if you will, persecuted those who are persecuted, those who are insulted and those who are slandered.
[time=1880] The beatitude kind of stretches out over these two verses with one promised result,
[time=1886] those who are persecuted, those who are insulted and those who are slandered,
[time=1892] theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And on your note sheet, under number one you can just fill
[time=1898] in the blanks, the persecuted and insulted our blessed my friends, the persecuted and insulted
[time=1905] our blessed. And I want you to think about it, I want you to think about this because it really does make sense in light of all that we've just said about these beatitudes. These beatitudes describe
[time=1915] the true believer, right? This is a description of one who knows the Lord. This is the posture
[time=1923] of a true believer's heart. And to say it very bluntly to you this morning, I don't want to mix words at all, those who are truly devoted to Christ and his kingdom,
[time=1934] guess what will happen to those who are truly devoted to Christ and his kingdom? They will be
[time=1940] at odds with who? Who? Satan. Somebody who is truly and genuinely a child of God by virtue of that
[time=1955] relationship and by virtue of all that that relationship calls him or her too, they will be
[time=1962] at odds with Satan. Look at 2 Timothy 3.12, I think it's there on your note sheet. Look what it says
[time=1968] here. Paul, very important here to hear this. And we're going to come back to Paul here in just a
[time=1974] moment. Paul, whether it's to Timothy or a couple of other churches that we'll see and some references
[time=1981] coming up, he's got this burden. He gets very important to Paul that people who he writes to,
[time=1987] he really wanted them to understand this truth. He says that in a number of different places, in a number of different ways, here's one of them. He writes to the young pastor, his young son in
[time=1998] the faith, Timothy, and he wants Timothy to know, 2 Timothy 3.12, indeed, Timothy, all who desire
[time=2004] to live godly in Christ Jesus will be what? Say it out loud. Persecuted. Not might be. Not
[time=2012] could be. He says if you're going to live, what's it say? Live godly in Christ. You can fill in the
[time=2018] blanks there on your note sheet. Godly living produces persecution. It's not a maybe. It's not an if.
[time=2026] It's not a, I mean, maybe sort of, no. Godly living produces persecution. And you could put in
[time=2032] said instead of Godly, you could put obedient living. You could put faithful living. You could put God honoring living. No one who truly loves and follows Christ. No one who lives, very important
[time=2043] here. No one who lives in direct opposition to Satan. Nobody who lives in direct opposition
[time=2056] to Satan and his sinful system can expect to do so without antagonizing Satan and that system.
[time=2066] Say it this way. If you're really going to stand against the things that he stands for, Satan in
[time=2075] mind here. If you're really going to, as an individual, if you, as a family, if we're going to,
[time=2083] as a community of faith, if someone's really going to stand against greed, if we're really
[time=2090] going to stand against lust and sensuality and illicit behavior, if we're going to really stand against laziness and hatred and prejudice and bigotry, if you and I were to take a really serious
[time=2104] stand against materialism and cheating and lying, if you're going to, if you're going to care more
[time=2110] about, if you're going to take a stand and care more about giving than you are about getting.
[time=2116] Somebody said it like this, if you're really going to an essence, pick a fight with Satan,
[time=2123] which that would be picking a fight. He is so for those things that when you and I stand against
[time=2131] those things, it's picking a fight. And this guy goes on to say, if you're going to pick a fight with Satan, he'll throw a punch back guaranteed every time. And the scriptures are incredibly clear
[time=2147] that this is, that this is exactly when you raised your hand, so to speak, when you bowed the knee
[time=2154] of your heart, when you responded to the call of God on your life and you fully surrendered your
[time=2160] heart and life to him, when you and I signed up for this thing, the scriptures are clear. It is exactly what we signed up for. We didn't sign up for ease. We didn't sign up for leisure. No,
[time=2170] look at Philippians 1.29. You can turn there or you can look at it on the screen. Philippians 1.29,
[time=2176] 4.2. Now here Paul writes to the church at Philippi. Paul wants the Philippians to know this.
[time=2180] For to you, it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in him and believing in him,
[time=2190] in essence, that's the easy part, not only to believe in him, but to also, what? Say it out loud,
[time=2197] suffer for his sake. Suffering, my friends, has been assigned. It's an assignment that you've
[time=2206] been given. It's just part of what comes with knowing him. Look at 1 Thessalonians 3.3. Paul
[time=2212] wants the Thessalonian church to know this. 1 Thessalonians 3.3. So that no one would be
[time=2218] disturbed. They were experiencing all kinds of afflictions. They're experiencing all kinds of persecution. And Paul doesn't want them confused so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we have been, what a word. Say it out loud,
[time=2234] destined for this. Paul says to the church at Thessalonica, and Paul says to you and I,
[time=2241] this morning, my friends, this is this suffering, this discomfort, this difficulty, this persecution.
[time=2250] He says it's your destiny as a believer. Shouldn't be surprised by it,
[time=2258] shouldn't be shocked by it, and shouldn't be trying to avoid it. Because it is our destiny,
[time=2266] he says, as believers. Corbin mentioned in his prayer earlier, 1 Peter 2, where it says it's our
[time=2273] calling. We've been called to suffer. And you know what I thought about this first hour,
[time=2280] I'm glad I could find it. It just kind of popped in my mind, and we took a chance and went there, and now I know it is here. Go to Acts 9, if you would. I don't think, maybe on the screens.
[time=2289] Go to Acts 9. There was a Acts 9, 10. I want to start there. I want to just show you this,
[time=2298] because I've shown you a number of references here where Paul has been really clear with these folks that he's written to. He was really clear with Timothy. He was really clear with the Thessalonians. He was really clear with the Philippians. Paul had this message.
[time=2311] He wanted them to understand. I want you to understand how it is that Paul was so clear about this, and I want to take you back to the very beginning. It was still Saul at this point.
[time=2322] The name change hadn't happened, but here is where Saul is called into ministry.
[time=2327] And it says there in verse 10, now there was the disciple at Damascus. Remember the road to Damascus, the light, Saul's blinded. God comes and makes himself real, calls Saul to himself.
[time=2338] There was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias,
[time=2344] he said, "Here I am, Lord." And the Lord said to him, "Get up and go to the street, called straight and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul,
[time=2354] for he is praying, and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands
[time=2362] on him so that he might regain his sight." But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many
[time=2368] about this man how much harm he did to you, to your saints, how much harm he did to your
[time=2374] saints at Jerusalem." Most of you know, Saul was murdering Christians. Saul was persecuting
[time=2381] Christians in those early days. And here he has authority, verse 14, from the chief priests
[time=2391] to bind all who call on your name. So Ananias isn't quite feeling it. Not quite sure how he's going to do this, but the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine
[time=2402] to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel, for I will show him
[time=2408] how much he must, what? Say it out loud, suffer for whose name's sake, for my name's sake."
[time=2418] Paul knew all about this. It was the life and it was the reality. It was the existence that God
[time=2424] had called him to. And if you follow the life of Paul, if you read about what he faced and what
[time=2430] he experienced, you and I know. It was city after city after city of persecution after persecution
[time=2437] beating after beating imprisonment after imprisonment because it was what happens to those who took a
[time=2446] stand for that, which was true and right. One first century church father, as he looked back at the
[time=2453] scripture's description of normative Christian living being marked by persecution. This first
[time=2461] century church father said this when assessing the state of one's faith, the absence of persecution
[time=2467] and its subsequent discomfort should be cause for alarm and great concern. Are you alarmed?
[time=2477] This morning, is there great concern in you? Is there the presence or the absence of persecution
[time=2487] and its subsequent discomfort? And really, you know, it's what, and I want to reiterate this,
[time=2494] my friends, it's what happens. It really is. It's what happens when you choose to make decisions in
[time=2500] life in your relationships. It's what happens when you choose to make decisions in life in your
[time=2506] business. It's what happens when you choose to make decisions in life with your kids, with other people and your social circuits. It's what happens when you choose to stand for what's
[time=2519] right. As I read through this book, as I track from the very beginning pages of Genesis all the way
[time=2526] through the end on this theme of persecution, you see it again and again and again. It really is.
[time=2533] It really becomes in your mind as you read normative. It's just what happens. You go to Genesis 39,
[time=2540] you can write that down. Genesis 39, read it tonight. Go over it yourself. Talk about it with your kids. Genesis 39, you find Joseph in prison. In Genesis 39, you see Joseph in prison, in the
[time=2552] dungeon, in Pharaoh's dungeon, in an absolute world of hurt being completely and absolutely and
[time=2558] totally mistreated. And if you know the story of Joseph at all, you realize the dungeon prison
[time=2564] experience of Genesis 39 is due to the fact that as a young man with great character and with great
[time=2571] courage who'd been sold into slavery by jealous brothers, he found himself in Egypt. He'd come under the care of this guy named Potiphar who was a high-ranking official in Pharaoh's government.
[time=2584] Potiphar had taken a liking to Joseph because of his character, because of his obedience,
[time=2591] because of his faithfulness. He put him in charge of his entire estate and Potiphar went to play golf with some guys for the weekend. I don't know where he went, but he goes away for a few days and
[time=2602] Potiphar's wife thinks Joseph's hot. Potiphar's wife thinks Joseph's it and she comes after him.
[time=2610] She seduces him. She wants to sleep with him and she lets it be known right there. And there's
[time=2617] nobody around. There's nobody in the house. Nobody there. And he just does what you do
[time=2626] when you're committed to following and honoring and obeying God. He runs. He leaves this jacket
[time=2636] in her hands and he splits. And she gets fired up and she accuses him of attempted rape and the
[time=2642] officials come in and throw him in jail. Daniel, Daniel 6, you can write that down. Daniel 6,
[time=2648] Daniel 6, similar story young man. Daniel taken away from his family and friends 1500 miles away to a place called Babylon with a crazy king named Nebuchadnezzar. And already in the story in Daniel 1, 2, and 3, you see tremendous character in the face of great persecution. In Daniel 6,
[time=2664] you see it again where jealous peers of Daniel. Daniel had been elevated because of his character
[time=2671] and his faithfulness. Now under King Darius, Darius loved Daniel. These guys were jealous of Daniel's
[time=2678] rise to power. They coerced Darius into passing a new law that says nobody can pray to any other
[time=2685] God but the God of the Babylonians because these guys knew every day, a couple of times a day, Daniel dropped to his knees, opened his window, prayed toward home and the God of his people,
[time=2695] the true and living God. So Daniel hears about the law and does what you do when you're devoted
[time=2702] and fully surrendered to honoring and obeying God. He opens the windows, gets on his knees.
[time=2709] It's a trap. They come out. He's busted and he doesn't get tossed in a prison. He gets tossed in a cave with a bunch of lions. Many of you know the story.
[time=2721] It's just normative. Lions, dens and dungeons, not normative for you and I today, discomfort
[time=2728] and difficulty because you're willing to do what's right. Nothing's changed on that front.
[time=2736] All of this I think leads us to a few questions. A few questions that I believe every one of us
[time=2742] in the room this morning must be willing to ask. Let's just first start with the obvious one and I hope you'll ask it. Am I experiencing persecution? You can write that on your notesheet. Am I experiencing persecution? Now clearly you may not be in danger of being kidnapped, beaten or
[time=2758] murdered because of your stand against Satan, but, but, but you are susceptible to the discomfort.
[time=2765] You are susceptible to the possible social alienation. You are susceptible to the things that might be
[time=2775] said about you. You are susceptible to the, to the, to the view that people might begin to have of you
[time=2782] if you chose to do or chose not to do certain things. If you and your family,
[time=2788] if you as an individual or you as a couple or, you know, you as a family really took a very strong
[time=2795] stand against those things that you felt like and the scriptures teaches or bring dishonor to God.
[time=2801] A few and I took a stand against Satan and his system. What would that look like? What would that bring?
[time=2809] Are you experiencing persecution? Question one, question two, is your entire life being lived in
[time=2816] direct opposition to Satan and his system? Is your entire life being lived in direct,
[time=2823] opposite, direct, absolute opposition to Satan and his system? Now I wonder if I had you in your
[time=2831] mind's eye take a highlighter or a pen and, and if I just told you to look at that question and if I said to you, okay, there's one word in that question that's really, really telling. There's one word in that question that I want you to circle in your mind's eye that's really, really
[time=2847] important as it relates to the answering of that question and the implications of that answer.
[time=2852] How many of you think you know what the word is? Raise your hand.
[time=2856] A few brave souls. I think it's entire. I think it's the word entire.
[time=2864] And I want you to ask yourself that question this morning. Is your entire life
[time=2874] being lived in direct opposition to Satan and his system? I know I'll date myself by using this
[time=2882] illustration, but here's what comes to my mind when I think about entire or, or not my entire
[time=2888] life. When I was a kid growing up, sometimes when we'd be on the run or sometimes just for fun
[time=2894] because I liked him, my mom would make us TV dinners. Anybody remember TV dinners? At least
[time=2900] that's what I called them. You with me the really the little tray type thing all covered with plastic
[time=2909] and you had your your entree in one compartment and your couple of vegetables and your your desserts kind of sick when you think about it. You just threw it all in the oven and it got hot and they took the plastic off and the kids would be like wow this is a great TV dinner.
[time=2921] Different compartments, right? Or I loved these as well and these are still around.
[time=2931] TV dinners may be around too. I don't know. I haven't had one in a while, but these I always love to. Pot pies. Remember chicken pot pie? Turkey, I liked him not cooked very long. I loved it when
[time=2942] the edge was still doughy, but we'll get into that later. Pot pies and the thing about pot pie
[time=2948] that was really so different than the TV dinner was really in essence all the pot pie was was the
[time=2955] whole TV dinner thrown into one deal, right? You had your chicken, you had your vegetable,
[time=2961] you had your dough, your breads, the whole nine yards. And see here's the point. See,
[time=2967] see the pot pie. So that's how God's called you live your Christian life. It's just all one big deal.
[time=2973] There are no compartments. There are no rooms off limits. There are no arenas
[time=2982] that kind of get left over. It's just all it's one big deal my friend and yet you and I try to TV dinner our faith. And I'm asking you this morning, is your entire life being lived in
[time=2995] direct opposition to Satan? And I just know that there are some in the room this morning. I know there are some of you watching on the broadcast, others of you listening online. I just know the
[time=3006] answer is no. I just know there are some in the room in this morning and all honesty you would say no. My entire life, my entire life isn't being lived. And if you'd allow me, I'd just ask
[time=3020] another question or two. What part of your life really? What part of your life isn't being lived
[time=3029] in direct opposition to him? Be honest. And why? It gets interesting. Why? Why isn't it?
[time=3044] Why are you with that one compartment? Why are you in that one arena?
[time=3054] Why are you holding out? Why do you hang on to the one arena of sin and rebellion,
[time=3061] that one segment of your life where you know down deep in your soul that God is not being honored?
[time=3067] Why do we do that? Well, I'll tell you one thing, 45 years of life and 22 years or so
[time=3076] of ministry, I've learned this. I've learned over the years that oftentimes when you don't give up,
[time=3082] when you choose to try and hang on to, you don't give up that last part of your life, that one compartment. I've learned that a lot of people don't do that. They don't give it up because when they do, when they do give it up, they know that life will get very, very uncomfortable.
[time=3098] They know that if they choose obedience in that arena, they know if they choose to follow him in that arena. They know if they take a stand against what's wrong in that arena, that
[time=3109] their very well may be in their reality that day, that week, that month. They know something
[time=3116] difficult or painful or hard may come. And we as humans don't want to face that. So oftentimes, we just keep moving on down that road. You know, Joseph, he could have just slept with her.
[time=3132] There wasn't anybody there. He could have TV dinnered this thing. But he understood,
[time=3139] and you and I are growing in our understanding of the fact that all compartments, all rooms
[time=3147] of your heart and life, every part of your life is to be lived in direct opposition to him.
[time=3156] Are you prepared? Write this down. Are you prepared to pick a fight with Satan?
[time=3161] Are you prepared to pick a fight with Satan? I just tried to be really, really practical. I'm just going to run through these. I hope as I just run through these, I hope there's something that you can connect with. And if in my efforts to give you something to connect with here, if it doesn't quite connect with you, I bet if you think about it. I bet you can come up with something. I bet you could come up with a few things that might represent picking a fight. I wrote down a few. What if you said no to your boss? What if you said no to your boss when he or she asks you to do something unethical? What kind of discomfort might that bring?
[time=3194] Satan would want you to not say no to them. Satan would want you to just say yes.
[time=3198] Are you ready to pick a fight with Satan? What if, what if due to the exorbitant amount of
[time=3206] sexual and illicit content which it contains, plus the enormous waste of time it often represents,
[time=3212] what if you unplugged your TV for two months? Seriously. What if you unplugged your TV for two
[time=3220] months and with the time you spent watching TV played outside, played games, read books,
[time=3226] had conversations with spouses or with family or with friends? What if you did other things?
[time=3231] What if you unplug that thing for two months? Satan wouldn't want you to unplug it because Satan
[time=3238] really likes the messages but it continuously transfers into the hearts and minds of you
[time=3245] and the younger ones in your home that watch it. Just an idea. What if you resisted Satan's
[time=3252] financial temptation? He's tempting us in all arenas of life. What if in the financial arena
[time=3258] you resisted Satan's financial temptation toward pleasure, you know, more pleasure, trips and more stuff? And what if instead you put it all on hold until your budget,
[time=3270] until your family or your personal budget was balanced, your giving became regular and sacrificial
[time=3276] and your savings account was growing? Because Satan wouldn't want you to have a savings account
[time=3282] that was growing. He wouldn't want you to be responsible and prudent. Satan wouldn't want you having a balanced budget. He wouldn't want you paying all your bills and he certainly doesn't want you giving. So what if you picked a fight and said I'm going to absolutely stop at nothing
[time=3297] to deal with this in my life? What if you didn't let a, you can add this one on, what if you didn't let a week go by? What if you individually, you as a couple, you as a family, you as a small community
[time=3308] or class? What if you just drew a really big line in the sand and didn't let a week go by without
[time=3314] going out of your way, going out of your way to serve someone in need? Satan doesn't want you going
[time=3321] out of your way to serve anybody. You draw a line there and you say I'm going to not think of myself,
[time=3327] I'm going to think of them, I'm going to go out of my way to meet a physical need, he'll punch back.
[time=3332] There'll be some discomfort. What if you, what if you told a gossip? What if you bumped into somebody
[time=3342] who was gossiping? What if you decided to tell a gossip to shut up? Oh, sorry kids, be quiet.
[time=3352] We don't say shut up. What if you told a gossip to be quiet?
[time=3356] What if you just said you know what, I'm not going to, not only am I not going to listen to it,
[time=3364] but I'm going to confront it? What if you exposed a whole line of gossip? What if you,
[time=3371] because of what you were aware of, were able to approach those saying things that weren't true or
[time=3377] saying things that weren't appropriate? What if you drew a line and just you know what, no more, not going to listen to it, I'm not going to put up with it, I'm going to do everything I can to encourage them and call them to a proper way of communicating. She's Satan doesn't want that.
[time=3392] Satan likes the disunity and Satan likes the critical spirits that get bred in a gossip
[time=3400] environment. So if you're willing, and I'm willing to say, you know what, no more, and he's going to punch back, and you're going to have, and I'm going to have a fight on our hands.
[time=3410] I wonder what you're willing to do this week. I don't think you'll be kidnapped,
[time=3418] but I bet you could find an arena or two in your life where if you stood, really stood for what
[time=3425] was right, you might feel some discomfort. There may be some heat. I hope you'll give it some thought
[time=3432] and I pray to God he'll give you the strength to live that out. Would you stand and let me pray. We're going to come back next week with part two of this message on what it means to be insulted and slandered for his namesake. Father, God, we love you, and we are so grateful for times like this
[time=3448] where we can look to your word, and it's great truth. God, our prayer today is that this great truth would stay with us. God, I pray that you would give every one of these individuals in this room today that knows you and is leaving today with a desire to be open to whatever persecution,
[time=3464] whatever suffering, whatever difficulty may come our way as we stand for you. Help us to know, God,
[time=3471] what to stand for. Help us to know what that looks like, God, and give us real courage to live
[time=3477] it out. Well, thank you for it in your son's name and all the people agreed and said, amen.
