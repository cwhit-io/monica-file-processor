[time=108] - Amen, you may be seated.
[time=119] - Every Sunday in September, I'm gonna just do my best to teach and share with all of you what we as a leadership have been learning.
[time=127] I've been telling you about our study of the Gospels and the Book of Acts in our attempt to be reminded and to get clear again on what followers of Christ lived like to look at that first church in Acts and get clear again on how that very first church did what they did, what they valued and how they did ministry and as we've been looking at our Lord and if we've been trying to look at those that followed him, there's just been some amazing things that have jumped out at us all over again and I can't wait to share with you in September but I was thinking the other day about the people that Jesus, when you read through the Gospels the people that Jesus was drawn to again and again and again and again it just that you read it wherever he went, whatever town he walked into whatever you know what was going on as he moves in and through this three-year span of ministry he seemed to be drawn to these people again and again and again and again I got some names on the screen for you, Zacchaeus the woman at the well Nicodemus and Peter and this is just four, I could have given you 16 but take Zacchaeus Zacchaeus was this swindler, he was this crooked tax collector, very unlike our own Bob Lee, I have to mention that first hour the guys in the back were killing Bob Lee, you may not know Bob Lee but he's a tax collector here in town, he does a great job and he's very ethical we love Bob, everybody say thank you Bob Zacchaeus was no Bob Lee, Zacchaeus was this swindler, he was this unethical cheat who took people for all they were worth and he was happy doing it it's a short little guy, remember, he hit up in a sycamore tree that day Jesus came into town and you might want to just put next to Zacchaeus his name, you could just put unethical and Jesus as he walks into this town, places absolutely packed, there's people everywhere, I mean they're on the street, they're on the sides, everybody's wanting a piece of him and he stops in the middle of it all, he looks up into this tree to the swindling unethical cheat and says dude I want to have dinner with you, dinner was a big deal back then I want to, I want to commune with, I want to fellowship with, I want to be, would take me to your house I look at that second one there, woman at the well, you know you could just put unethical next to Zacchaeus, you could just put immoral next to her she'd been sleeping with five men the man she was sleeping with in this conversation with Jesus as he meets her there at the well that day, the guy she's sleeping with, the sixth guy he's not her husband either, her life has just been filled with promiscuity, sinfulness, and immorality she is, you know, by standards in that day and by standards in our day, she's dirty and he, it's an amazing story, I can't get into it all but he went out of his way, when you study that passage you realize he could have gotten he and the disciples could have gotten where they were going a much quicker way he chooses to go the long way so he can, I believe stop at that well, have that conversation with that immoral, confused, dirty woman and offer her life Nicodemus was a Pharisee, you could just put proud, you know he's showing some humility in this conversation with Jesus late at night but he's a Pharisee, he looks great on the outside but on the inside he's you know, he's all dead and confused and nowhere near what God had wanted and yet Jesus makes time for him, Jesus makes time Jesus pursues, Jesus has this radar that just seems to be bent toward the unethical and the immoral and the prideful and then you got Peter who just what? Peter just failed Peter just screwed up, he just flat out failed and what you see coming from Jesus, post tomb, post resurrection what you see coming from Jesus toward this failure is what?
[time=399] Grace, what do you see coming toward the unethical tax collector? Grace, what do you see coming toward the immoral, dirty woman?
[time=407] Grace, what do you see coming toward the prideful? Grace, what if you and I what if we gave more grace?
[time=415] What if our radar were you know, set up like his, what if we were drawn to unethical, immoral, dirty, confused, lost, hurting prideful, failing people?
[time=431] What would that lead your life to look like? What would this place begin to look like?
[time=439] Food for thought last little bit of food for thought. Before the greeters come down, don't forget and if we're all going to shoot straight, right? All those people are already in this room.
[time=455] Agreed? Yeah.
[time=459] So we ought to be grace filled with each other because we're all up there and we ought to be grace filled dishing it out to those we bump into. What an amazing thing he could do with hearts that were bent that way.

[time=1315] as Adam plays would you just bow your heads
[time=1321] and maybe just close your eyes and I thought first hour and I just kind of felt the same thing sitting down here this morning this hour there are probably some in the room this morning and in whatever way and it may look different but it may be raining in your life today right now you may be here this morning filled with confusion and sorrow you may be tired and weary of fighting that same old sin you may have had something done to you somebody may have left somebody may have said something a relationship may be in turmoil your home might be in turmoil your soul might be in turmoil for a number of reasons but it's raining you're sad and you want to have faith but your faith feels weak you want to make sense of it you can't you're not quite sure what to do and I'm reminded of that passage in James 1 it says consider it all joy my brothers when you encounter various trials knowing this that the testing of your faith produces endurance and lead endurance have its perfect effect that you might be perfect and complete lacking in nothing and you believe that and you know that that's true but truth be told you sit here this morning and it's just so hard for you to consider it joy and so if that's you I just wanted to give you it we wanted to give you the chance you know this is a family and we're trying our best to love each other well and part of that means just coming alongside and so if you'd be willing to just stand quietly where you are if it's raining in your life today and you could use some encouragement and you just would be willing to let me pray for you this morning just stand just quietly right where you are thank you just stand just stand there and be still before God and know that he loves you and just give us the privilege of praying for you this morning we'll just take a moment here father those that are even still standing as I speak father they inspire me and they encourage me this morning with their honesty and their vulnerability God they stand before you this morning confused and hurting to some degree and we don't know all that is going on in their lives but the great truth this morning God is that you do and so God with great confidence and with great hope and with great boldness as you've told us to we come before your throne this morning and we lift these brothers and these sisters up to you they love you God they are trying to trust you and walk humbly and faithfully and obediently and God where they are weary and tired we pray that you would give them strength and courage God allow the word of God the spirit of God and the people of God to come alongside them in whatever ways we might be able to to speak hope and truth back into their tired hearts God may we do our very best with your help to paint a picture for them once again of what it means and what it looks like to follow after you God in your time and in your place when it's just right would you remove the rain and would you bring the sunshine once again and until then God would you faithfully please lift these dear friends up and give us the privilege God of helping in whatever ways we can and all the people in the room agreed and said amen amen all right open up to Matthew chapter 5 if you would and what we're going to jump into this morning is really last week was really the first part of a message today we basically get to the second part of last week's message regarding the blessing of persecution in the life of a Christian in our study of true happiness we've been talking about for eight nine ten weeks now God wants you happy and in our study of God designed happiness from the Beatitudes here in Matthew 5 we came last week to Matthew 5 verses 10 11 and 12 and we saw there in Matthew 5 10 to 12 that contrary to what some may think the believer actually experiences macarias it's that word blessed that we see all the way through that passage and contrary to what many people might think we saw last week that the genuine believer actually experiences macarias blessedness happiness true deep joyful bliss at the soul level when they are willing to face and endure persecution or mistreatment for righteousness sake Matthew 5 10 to 12 let me read that for you again can I do that it says there in Matthew 5 10 blessed happy joyful are those blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness and I think it's good to stop there just real quick I had a great conversation with a good friend this week and I want to make sure we're all all on the same page here don't mistake persecution for righteousness sake don't mistake that with discipline by God for your disobedience sake sometimes you'll bump into folks and they'll be going good not I'm getting absolutely slaughtered here I'm getting killed I mean what's God doing and then you have a conversation with him and you realize what God's doing he's not allowing persecution for righteousness sake he's disciplining them because they're disobedience it says here blessed happy are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the what for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you Jesus says when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me rejoice and be glad for your reward in heaven is great for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you we saw last week my friends and I've included it again in your study in your notesheet for this morning just for brief review we saw in 2 Timothy 3 12 that godliness births persecution whenever you desire to live godly scripture says you will be persecuted godliness births persecution Philippians 1 29 we saw there that our assignment it's almost as if we're in god's classroom and our assignment is to suffer we are going to as believers suffer it's our assignment first thessalonians 3 3 powerful verse we saw there that persecution is our destiny our destiny is to be persecuted our destiny as true believers is to live life in such a way that we stand in contrast to Satan thus opening ourself up to the attacks that he will most assuredly bring we saw last week in summary that the suffering and difficulty that comes when one's entire life is lived in direct opposition to Satan should be viewed not as a surprise but as normative now we didn't get to a couple things last week let me give you one quote can I do that I want to give you one quote and a warning a quote and a warning from the scriptures that we didn't get to last week and let me just give you some brief backdrop before we get to the quote and the warning we talked last week about actually picking a fight with Satan we talked about the willingness that you might have or I might have to have this mentality that is so completely for what is true and right and good that we're actually looking for opportunities because of that mentality because of that willingness to take that certain stand we're actually looking for opportunities to stand against what's wrong what's what's not honoring to the Lord what goes against his prescribed will we're so completely for what is right that we're looking for opportunities to stand against we're willing to be talked about we're willing to be ostracized socially we're willing to have even our kids or our families viewed as different because of certain commitments that we might give ourselves to but one author reminds us that we can always go the other way I read it last week one author reminds us that we have a choice in this matter and we can choose to go the other way you don't have to be persecuted you can actually live life in such a way as to escape it he says if you want to avoid persecution you can simply approve of what the world does instead of standing against the world's morals or standing against the world's ethics or the world's values just affirm them or even if you don't want to affirm them just ignore them point being don't stand against them don't call sin sin don't confront sin in the lives of those you love and then turn a blind eye to your own sin don't separate yourself from the world's system around you go along with it blend in to it don't stand out from it laugh at its debauchery enjoy its immoral entertainment and smile when it mocks God and those that follow him he goes on to say here's the bottom line be ashamed to take a stand for what's true and you will most certainly escape persecution now I mentioned a quote and a warning I'll just get to the warning real quick here because it's so connects to what that one author just said Luke 926 Luke 926 for whoever is say it out loud ashamed for whoever is ashamed of me this is Jesus speaking and he says forever who is ashamed of me and my words the son of man will be what say it out loud ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels in other words if you're ashamed of Christ if you're ashamed of Christ the text there says basically if you're ashamed of Christ and or his words these these very words of his that we have recorded for us right here in the scriptures then at the end of the day you might be well you might be one who at the end of the day he ends up being ashamed of when it's all said and done think about it this really does it begins to speak to the validity and it's where we're going this morning it begins to speak to the validity of one's professed faith I mean think about it if you if someone's heart in what they choose and what they value and how they live if someone's heart is characterized by being postured toward the world if someone's life evidence is not spiritual fruit but let's say worldly system or worldly value if someone's life produces worldly fruit but no spiritual fruit if someone's heart is postured toward the world if someone's really not inclined at all to stand against evil while passionately aligning one's heart and life to what is right then what leads that someone to believe they're a saved redeemed and transformed child of God says in Matthew 5-10 we just read it blessed are you when people blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness when the heart is bent toward righteousness when the life is postured toward righteousness blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness because those are the ones who are redeemed for theirs is the kingdom of heaven it's a powerful warning and it really does flow right into our second point I've got it there on your note sheet for you last week persecution is a blessing today persecution is a test persecution is a test and would you please turn to first Peter and we're going to look at this passage here first Peter chapter 1 if you would back toward the back of your New Testament first Peter chapter 1 we're going to begin in verse 3 and just kind of make our way down through verses 3 4 5 6 and 7 and the real the real important point and the thing I want you to see really is in verse 7 but stay with me and let's get there I want you to kind of have it build up I want you to see how Peter moves into this passage I want you to see what is so on his heart to remind you of and to allow you to consider before he takes you to this place in verses 6 and 7 it's a really really powerful passage blessed be the God and Father you see it there blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to his great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away reserved in heaven for you now just stop right there and just be so grateful this morning I hope you followed me there when you look at those two verses when you read those two verses when we take a look at just the truth in those two verses when you consider what he's done for you when you look at where he has how he has blessed you when you realize that he has given you great mercy he has given you new life and being born again he has provided you an eye a living hope he has given us an imperishable inheritance reserved in heaven that will not fade away all of that is true all of that is given all of that is yours to experience and mine to experience from here until eternity because of what God did by his great love and mercy through his son Jesus Christ he's given you all of that what a salvation you and I possess now watch this look at verse look at verse five he goes on and says who are you know he's talking about believers who have been given all of that are protected by the power of God you realize that right you're protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time in this you greatly rejoice now watch out here he goes here comes the here comes the shift in this you greatly rejoice even though now for a what say it out loud little while little while it's a relative term right little while in comparison to what eternity even though now he says you've been given all that look how I mean your faith is a stout faith you have been given so much and there comes with it so much hope and blessing now he says for a little while if necessary you can greatly rejoice for you have been distressed by various trials it says in verse six you have been distressed by various trials so that and here's why why the trials so that the proof huge word underline it make note of it so that the proof remember I said this is about validity so that the proof of your faith being more precious than gold which is perishable even though tested by fire your faith may be found to result in praise the result of your faith praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ you see your faith is tested and proven my friends in the midst of tribulation in the midst of the fire when the rain comes down the hardest when the persecution hits Peter reminds us that your faith is being tested and in the testing it's being proven and there are times I believe when God senses the need for your faith and mind to be strengthened and the way James won the way he strengthens your faith is he tests it and some might want to make that out to be cruel and some might want to make that out to be mean spirited and some might want to make that out to be whatever they may want to make it out to be the fact of the matter is God loves you deeply God knows that it is your faith that will see you through and he knows your faith in mind need to be strengthened and so to strengthen that faith he tests you he tests our faith church history is amazing on this particular subject many of you know this church history tells us that there were actually as Peter writes to the church in a time of great persecution church history tells us there were actually two groups of people for the most part that had made their way into the church at this time this time was AD 65 while the Christian church had experienced enormous growth the Christian church also found itself an enormous persecution in AD 65 for the most part at the hands of a crazed ruler who oversaw Rome and his name was what do you remember Nero and in AD 65 in this region as Peter writes these very words to the church Nero is absolutely going crazy there were two groups I said let's talk about the first group there were many in that day as there are still today very willing to be identified with Christ there were many in the church at that time in AD 65 who if you ask them hey raise your hand if you're in they're just quick to raise their hand there there were many in that day as there are in these days who were really okay with raising their hand they kind of liked the idea of being identified with the body as it were as long as it didn't cost them anything as long as the raising of the hand was free as long as the raising of the hand didn't inject into their lives the difficulty and the challenge and the heartache of pain and you know as we've studied the scriptures you know I've told you about our elders and our staff reading through the gospels and the book of Acts I'll tell you as you read through the gospels and as you watch Jesus and how he said what he said and what he called his followers to and what he stood for and what irritated him and what moved him and stirred him I'll tell you what Jesus didn't stand for this Jesus wasn't one who took lightly some shallow or some you know back and forth maybe I am maybe I'm not no he didn't stand for it Peter who watched Jesus not stand for it Peter's not going to stand for it either he's so direct he's so forthright here in his writings his message was clear his message was clear then my friends and his message is clear to you and I today real faith will be tested and real faith will endure real faith will be tested and real faith will pass the test so that verse 7 you're going to go through the various trials so that the proof of your faith being more precious than gold which is perishable even though tested by fire may be found to be valid may be found to be real now I mentioned two groups of people that had made their way into the church the second group there was this first group that got exposed to say it that way when tested their faith failed they compromised they caved there was another group though whose faith testing went extremely well so well that they passed the test so well that they not only passed the test but they passed from this life into the next you see in eighty sixty five Nero hated Christians in eighty sixty five Nero was so threatened by this inner power that he sensed they had in eighty sixty five Nero and all those who served Nero were absolutely petrified of this loyal faithful band of people who seemed to be willing to stand up to anything and so in eighty sixty five they were tortured and they were martyred and they were murdered by the thousands and as I read last week I came across a ceremony that I had learned about back in the seminary days years ago and it all kind of came rushing back to me there was a ceremony that Nero soldiers and those in his government would perform a ceremony they would force people to go through anybody who had been suspected of following Christ anybody who's allegiance to Nero had been suspected of waning they would put them through the ceremony where they would be ordered to light an incense stick and while the incense burned they would simply but clearly declare that Caesar was Lord and divine ruler of all and they would declare with incense burning their love for him and in that case Nero upon completing the ceremony they would receive a certificate called alabellis a-l-l-a-b-e-l-i-s alabellis they would receive the certificate called alabellis the the the Nero worshiper would then carry the certificate around at all times so as to indicate his loyalty and allegiance to anyone who would inquire of course then faithful followers of Christ had no alabellis and when they refused in those settings or on the street when approached when they refused to articulate loyalty to anyone other than the Lord they were labeled revolutionaries which is what they were they were revolutionaries they stood up against the system they tried with all their heart and might and gods helped to take back what was true and right it's what revolutionaries do and they got labeled by Nero and his cohorts revolutionaries or rebels they were a threat to Nero and his empire and so without their alabellis Nero wrapped Christians and dipped them in pitch and set them on fire and used them as living burning torches to light his garden parties he sewed them and usually the younger ones in the skins of wild animals they would kill wild animals take the skin off the wild animal so the young Christ follower smaller in stature inside the wild animal skin and then Nero would stick his hunting dogs upon them to tear them limb from limb they would be tortured on the rack for their refusal to follow Nero they would be scraped scraped was a process by which molten lead would be poured over their entire bodies hot brass plates were affixed to the tenderest parts of their bodies eyes were gouged out parts of their bodies were cut off and roasted before their eyes their hands and feet were burned while cold water was poured over them to lengthen the agony and so it goes on and on and on mothers fathers and sons and daughters young and old Christ followers who refused to compromise from all walks of life persecuted and receiving the kingdom of heaven because that's what happens to those who stand they're persecuted and those who are persecuted for righteousness sake the Lord said in Matthew 5 received the kingdom of heaven now that was that was Rome 80-65 and I told you last week and I just got to tell you again it's so hard for me to stand here in this moment right here because everything in me as maybe everything in you at this point feels as if we ought at night you know we feel like we ought to be able to come up with something you know that we'd have to face we ought to be willing to come up with some scenario where somehow good night couldn't we show the same kind of faith and the same kind of guts that these people showed and I'll tell you what I could sit up there in my office for a month and I can scratch ideas on a pad and I'm just confessing to you I've come up with nothing you're just you're just not going to get your foot cut off this week it's just not going to happen nobody's going to say a word to you for the most part that you came here today you are in no danger whatsoever and you won't be for the most part in terms of this society and those that govern and so as I think about it and I think oh god please I want to give our family you know something practical you know that practical word starts coming in and this all seems so impractical this seems so enormously significant and then I I'm going to talk to you about what you watch and I'm just I'm admitting to you that there's a part of me that feels like anything from Nero and 65 AD on now in our next couple of minutes it's just going to feel like we're skating by but let me just say something to you I don't think you're going to get scraped this week I don't think anybody's going to take your kids away and kill them in front of your eyes I don't think you and I are going to face in any way shape or form the physical persecution that they faced but here's but here's the thought that I believe the Lord gave me on this I don't know that it's so much about the physical persecution I think it's more about the fact that they wouldn't compromise and if we're going to make it about whether you're going to compromise or not then I think we have something to talk about amen if we're going to talk about beheadings and the rack we got nothing to talk about but I don't think that's what's at the heart of this I think Peter writes to you and I today to say hey wait a minute these people didn't compromise so our practical list of things you know what I think if you and I gave ourselves to some of these things I think it could move us in our lives to a place of no compromise that then who knows what we might encounter then believe me Satan's arsenal is deep and so let me just give you a few things to think about and you can just write these down and we're gonna go and I don't say that in a quick and dismissive fashion but these are things I believe that would allow you and I to give attention not to are we gonna get murdered but are we gonna compromise and if you're not gonna compromise if you're gonna draw that big of a line in the sand and put that big of a stake in the ground then hang on because I believe like I told you last week when you pick a fight he'll punch back so here's a few things commit to sexual purity in a culture today that could care less about God's design for sex commit to absolute no holds barred complete sexual purity in a culture today that could care less about God's design everywhere you go you will be pointed in the other direction everything you turn on will point you in the other direction most everything you turn to most all the stuff we hear on the airway it's gonna point you and I in a different direction commit to purity in a culture that could care less and hang on commit to complete honesty and integrity in the workplace I mean complete complete honesty and integrity in the workplace are you a supervisor then supervise with integrity and complete honesty if you're an employee underneath a supervisor follow him or her with complete honesty and integrity if you own a business run it in such a way as to evidence complete and absolute honesty and integrity commit to raising kids commit some of us in the room we're still in the throes of trying our best with God's help and the help of others to raise kids to raise a next generation that might follow after God not because mom and dad did but because their hearts have been lit on fire by the spirit of God we're trying our best to raise kids commit to rate you want to fight with the enemy then commit to raising kids that aren't over indulged over entertained or under disciplined commit to raising kids and maybe you like me need to just ask for help on this which is what I've done because I need it commit to raising kids that aren't over indulged over entertained or under disciplined I've heard quotes along these lines for the last few years heard one again two weeks ago never according to one expert has there been a lazier generation than the one we're raising and that's not their fault just so we're clear on that because you and I are doing the raising commit to spending only what you have and giving enough to stretch your faith one of the ways we avoid compromise one of the ways that you and I lose our strength one of the ways that the church loses its ability to impact is because of the financial issues in my own life and in your own life and in our life as a family commit to spending only what you have and giving enough to stretch your faith watch what God will do with that kind of commitment and watch what Satan will do to try and thwart it commit to confront sin in the lives of those you know and love and I want to make sure you read that last part in the lives of those you know and love I'm not saying hey look go be a zealot and pin some guy against the wall downtown who you don't know and tell him what a sinner he is I'm talking about people you know I'm talking about people you love I'm talking about people you're close to and are you close enough and do we love each other enough all of us on ethical immoral prideful people are we willing I'll tell you what if you are if you're willing to confront in love with appropriate grace yet with appropriate force the sin in my life or the sin and a friend of yours life then you know what Satan's not going to like where that's going see that's going toward unity and strength and health and he'll try and keep you away from that just some practical things to consider I hope you'll come back next week I can't tell you we've already been praying about it Steve Webster and I are going to stand here next week and take you back through line by line each be attitude with one practical application for each and we're going to spend the last part of the message next week giving anybody in the room the opportunity to for the first time in their life maybe find happiness we're going to give people a chance next week to meet the one who brings the happiness we're going to give people a chance next week to come and receive Christ and understand maybe for the first time what it means to know him and I hope you'll pray about that I hope you'll come bring your friends bring your family and we'll see what God does would you stand let me pray for us as we go don't forget the meeting afterwards we need you here for about five ten minutes we'll just break for about five minutes and then we'll we'll gather back in here for our our special meeting God thank you for the morning and we mean that God thank you for this time that you've given this family to consider and think about this truth and we need courage to live it out and we need the spirit of God and the word of God and the people of God to make progress with this God in our lives and I ask God on behalf of everybody here who's open to it that you'd bring that kind of help and that kind of guidance we love you we were so inspired God and so thankful for our brothers and sisters who who faced a much different reality than we do and I just beg you God to give us the kind of strength the kind of strength that they had to not compromise and God to hold on to what's true to pass that along to others as priests and God we pray that is you give us the strength to do that God that you'll grow your kingdom and that you'll grow your church and all the people agreed and said amen.
