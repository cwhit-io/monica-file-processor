[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - We're just going to review what we've been learning together this summer.
[time=34] We've had some physical postures to represent each one of the truths in the beatitudes.
[time=40] God wants us happy, we're learning how key defines happiness.
[time=46] It's not how the world or the United States of America defines happiness.
[time=52] And if we truly want the happiness that God offers, we need to have some postures in our hearts.
[time=57] And so we've just come up with these external expressions that hopefully will lead to heart transformation as we internalize the truth of each one of these beatitudes.
[time=68] So this morning's our last chance to do that together.
[time=70] And I just want to go through all the postures and say the beatitudes and hold each physical posture.
[time=77] Let me just mention something briefly about this one at the center.
[time=80] This was originally our posture for insulted because later on in the next verse, Jesus says that we should rejoice and be glad when we're persecuted and insulted and falsely accused.
[time=93] And Kelly ended up teaching both of those together and really all of them are the same, that insulted and falsely accused and persecuted.
[time=103] And so then we kind of changed and just felt like this posture was the best overarching posture to encompass all of the gladness that comes from poverty and mourning and gentleness and hunger and thirst for the righteousness of God.
[time=118] And so when we get to the end, we're just gonna lift up our arms in a posture of gladness and read that verse together that says rejoice and be glad for great is our reward in heaven.
[time=130] But let's move through each one together.
[time=132] Would you cup your hands, please?
[time=134] Bow your heads and lift them to heaven and repeat after me.
[time=137] Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[time=143] For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=145] And symbolic of mourning, would you cover your faces?
[time=151] Blessed are those who mourn.
[time=153] For they shall be comforted.
[time=157] Would you put a hand over your heart and raise a fist to heaven?
[time=164] Blessed are the gentle.
[time=166] For they shall inherit the earth.
[time=172] Now, would you stand symbolic of righteousness?
[time=175] With a hand over your stomach and a hand over your throat.
[time=179] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[time=182] For they shall be satisfied.
[time=188] And symbolic of merciful acts, would you reach a hand forward and look to your right and left and say, blessed are the merciful.
[time=200] For they shall be shown mercy.
[time=202] And the next beatitude, rubbing our hands together,
[time=209] symbolic of purity.
[time=210] Blessed are the pure in heart.
[time=214] For they shall see God.
[time=216] And would you extend your arms to the right and left
[time=222] as if making peace.
[time=224] Blessed are the peacemakers.
[time=227] For they shall be called sons of God.
[time=233] And then with your wrists together as if in chains.
[time=236] Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness's sake.
[time=241] Blessed are those who mourners who are here in righteousness's sake.
[time=245] For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=250] And now would you raise your hands toward heaven and just say the promise, which is this.
[time=256] Great is your reward in heaven.
[time=259] Rejoice and be glad.
[time=263] Thank you.
[time=266] You may be seated.

[time=573] I believe in you, I believe in you, I believe in you.
[time=587] Father in heaven we praise you, and we sing hallelujah.
[time=592] Praise the Lord the Almighty, the God who sits enthroned above the circle of the earth who devised a way to make his enemies, his friends,
[time=604] by sending your son Jesus to die in our place so that we could live and live for righteousness.
[time=614] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise you God. Praise you forever and ever and ever. Amen.
[time=629] Well hello again everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour broadcast. We're really thankful that you've tuned in, and I want to say just a few words this morning about an extremely special group of people that I am just growing in appreciation for
[time=643] and so very excited about what God's doing in their midst.
[time=647] And I want to invite you to maybe think about those in your life who could come and be a part of this amazing community of people.
[time=656] This group that I'm referring to is our student ministries here at Blackhawk under the leadership of Jesse Hannah and Mike Baker
[time=665] and a number of people who are involved in giving oversight and leadership to our students.
[time=672] This ministry has just in recent days exploded I think with not only numbers of kids but it has exploded
[time=680] in its appreciation for and its sensitivity to the spirit of God.
[time=685] God is really moving in the hearts and lives of these kids and whether it's our middle school ministry on Sunday mornings
[time=691] that we call liquid or whether it's our Wednesday night high school student ministry gathering that we call 212 from top to bottom across the board these kids are excited about their faith.
[time=704] Many of them have just come to faith many of them are exploring their faith and others have been walking with the Lord
[time=711] for you know a few years but either way it's an amazing group of kids that are giving themselves to the pursuit of God's word
[time=718] to the pursuit of loving and knowing him to the pursuit of knowing and loving each other and when you see high school kids
[time=726] and middle school kids who are passionate about their faith and passionate about living it out
[time=732] you know I have to confess I find myself oftentimes inspired by them inspired by our 14 and 15 16 year olds who are taking seriously
[time=743] this call that we've put out to follow Christ with a whole heart so if you know some high school kids that are looking for a place to connect
[time=752] if you've got a high school kid or middle school kid in your home Black Hawk would love to be a place that they could call home
[time=759] it's a safe place to hear a life changing very dangerous message and I'm so proud of Jesse and his team and so thankful for what I see God doing in that setting
[time=770] I hope you'll check it out Sunday mornings they meet middle school meet Sunday mornings at 9 o'clock and then the 212 high school gathering is on Wednesday nights at 730 across the street from our worship center
[time=782] in our north campus setting if you have any questions at all about student ministries here at Black Hawk please call the office
[time=789] they'd love to talk with you they'd love to answer any questions or you can reach them on our website at BlackhawkMinistries.org
[time=796] hey thank you so much for tuning in pray for our kids pray for our students this next generation of Christ followers that we believe have the potential to change the world
[time=826] and part in life with those who agree joy that those dreams are stolen and the prison souls are made
[time=836] will you come please be changed when you speak even the darkness has
[time=848] when you step to our friends in Jesus you restore every broken life and everything changed
[time=873] nothing to the poor and spirit and praise for all in need aside from those who live in darkness and innocence we need
[time=884] when you come with great big changes
[time=890] when you speak even the darkness has when you step to our friends in Jesus you restore every broken life
[time=908] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=938] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 73 seconds]
[time=1027] (upbeat music) - Hey, I'm thankful that Steve Webster's with me this morning.
[time=1040] Steve's one of our teaching pastors, and we have, Steve and I have had the privilege this summer, of doing our very best to take you as a family through this study of the Beatitudes, those first 12 verses there in Matthew 5.
[time=1053] And we entitled our series, "God Once You Happy," and I wanna just start this morning by saying, we're gonna do our very best today, Steve and I, to take you back through where we've been this summer, and there's a reason why we're going back through it, and we'll get to that a little bit later in the morning.
[time=1068] But we're gonna just do a kind of a quick review.
[time=1071] And as Steve and I thought about a way to kind of just kick off the review, I think it's safe to say that what we've discovered over the last several weeks is this.
[time=1079] God wants you happy.
[time=1082] He designed you to be happy in relationship with Him.
[time=1086] God wants you happy.
[time=1088] We've seen in our study that happiness, when we define it on God's terms, is not available in power.
[time=1098] Happiness is not available in food.
[time=1101] Happiness isn't available in pornography.
[time=1104] Happiness isn't available in stuff.
[time=1108] Happiness isn't available in all the ways in which society and culture today want you and I to think that it's available.
[time=1115] It's not.
[time=1116] Happiness, the way God designed it, macarias, that deep joy of the soul is available only in relationship with Him.
[time=1127] And if there's ever been one who's walked the face of the earth, and truly experienced macarias, if there was everyone who walked the face of the earth and truly knew what it meant to be an intimate relationship with the Father, that was who, Jesus.
[time=1142] So we thought we would just take the Beatitudes kind of real quick, not too quick, but sort of quick and just take each Beatitude and show you this morning how Jesus exemplified, how Jesus Himself lived out each of these truths that we've looked at over these last few weeks.
[time=1158] And so let's do that.
[time=1159] Turn in your Bibles to Matthew chapter five.
[time=1161] If you would, Steve, you gotta quote for us as we start.
[time=1164] Yes, I do.
[time=1165] Read that for us.
[time=1167] There's a few quotes this morning from a Blaze Pascal.
[time=1170] I hope you go check Him out today.
[time=1171] I hope you go home and Google Him.
[time=1174] He's a pretty fascinating guy.
[time=1176] Scientist, theologian, remarkable.
[time=1179] Blaze Pascal said this, it's on the wall of my classroom.
[time=1182] Some of you guys upstairs have already seen that.
[time=1184] You'll see it again tomorrow.
[time=1185] Go up there and look for it.
[time=1187] If man is not made for God, then why is he not happy, happy, except in God?
[time=1197] So it's, he lays bare my needs.
[time=1201] I cannot be happy outside of a personal relationship with the God who is pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.
[time=1213] And the only appropriate way for me to ever find happiness is to sing that word that we sang this morning over and over again, hallelujah.
[time=1220] There is no other way to be happy, friends, except to sing, hallelujah.
[time=1227] [AMEN] Hey, throughout the morning, we will say this.
[time=1229] Steve and I talked about this.
[time=1231] Very important throughout this morning, we're gonna ask you a question again and again and again.
[time=1236] We'll ask it probably in different ways, but you'll hear it very clearly again and again and again.
[time=1241] Are you happy?
[time=1243] Are you really?
[time=1246] And we would just wanna encourage you this morning to just make a commitment right now.
[time=1252] I mean, maybe you came in with this commitment already if so, that's great.
[time=1255] But if not, make a commitment right now to be honest with yourself today.
[time=1260] To just be brutally, absolutely and completely truthful with yourself.
[time=1267] Ask God right now to give you the strength and the courage
[time=1273] to be absolutely honest with yourself as you assess the happiness, fulfillment, satisfaction,
[time=1283] peace, level in your life, all right?
[time=1287] And we'll make that commitment together.
[time=1289] Here we go, Jesus and the Beatitudes.
[time=1292] Jesus and the Beatitudes number one, Jesus as poor in spirit, Steve and I immediately realized we had a problem on this one.
[time=1300] He exemplifies all of the Beatitudes except this one.
[time=1303] As we define poor in spirit, you'll all know, you'll remember we define poor in spirit as being acutely aware of your deep and utter absolute sinfulness.
[time=1314] Being poor in spirit is bankrupt in spirit.
[time=1317] It is one's realization of how absolutely depraved we are apart from God.
[time=1323] And so obviously Jesus didn't model this one for us.
[time=1327] But we felt like as we talked about it, what we would do is we would show you one individual who was very close to Jesus, who Jesus spoke very highly of who truly exemplified this very spirit in attitude, John the Baptist.
[time=1341] In fact, Jesus said what, Steve, about John the Baptist?
[time=1344] - He said in Luke seven, he said, "Among those born of women, none is greater than John." That's a remarkable statement to make.
[time=1354] Nobody in the world greater than John and then John makes these statements about himself in comparison to that compliment and it really begins to make a difference.
[time=1361] - Here's the humility, here's the attitude we want you to see on this poor in spirit.
[time=1366] John 127, write it down on your note sheet.
[time=1368] If you will, John 127, it is he who comes, John speaking here, John the Baptist speaking, he says, "It is he who comes after me," referring to Christ, "the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie." See right there you catch it.
[time=1383] In comparison to Christ, in comparison to the Lord, his view of himself, your view and my view of ourselves should be absolute and complete unworthiness.
[time=1394] Unworthy to even mess with his sandal.
[time=1399] Look what John 3.30 says.
[time=1402] Later in the Gospel of John, very simple, very profound.
[time=1406] He must, John referring to the Lord, he must increase, but I must what, say it out loud, decrease the spirit, this posture of poverty.
[time=1417] You will be happy, the Lord said, when you are poor in spirit, when you see and sense your unworthiness before him, are you happy?
[time=1431] Are you happy this morning?
[time=1436] The phrase that we came upon, Steve and I were talking, he was talking about just bringing application to this point and we were talking about culture's obsession with self as steam and Steve brought up a great phrase, what was it?
[time=1451] - God as steam.
[time=1453] I'm sure I didn't get that, I'm sure I took it from somebody.
[time=1456] - I will give it to you, it's right.
[time=1458] - God as steam, if I'm throwing myself a pity party all the time and then my focus, if I feel badly about myself, if I'm poor in spirit and I take that to mean that I'm a wretch and I'm always gonna be a wretch and I'm just pathetic and awful, then I've grown even more selfish 'cause my focus is still on me.
[time=1478] And Isaiah 41, there's this beautiful promise of the poor and needy seeking after water and God meeting them and satisfying them.
[time=1487] I love it, the poor in spirit is the first behind you 'cause if you don't begin there then I'm not sure the rest of it is gonna really fall into place.
[time=1493] If your starting point is, I've got my act together, then the rest of it doesn't seem to really have the same sort of force with it.
[time=1502] Speaking of John the Baptist and again, just put it together with me real quick.
[time=1505] John says, I'm not worthy to untie Jesus' shoes.
[time=1509] Now why would John untie Jesus' shoes do you think?
[time=1512] To wash his feet.
[time=1515] John says, I can't even hold that job.
[time=1517] I don't have the qualifications for that job.
[time=1519] And Jesus says, among those born of women there's no one greater than John.
[time=1524] What does that say about Jesus?
[time=1526] I mean, how great is he?
[time=1527] Do you see that?
[time=1528] Remarkable.
[time=1529] Last week, Kelly talked the second time about being insulted and persecuted for righteous and the sake.
[time=1536] And John is a wonderful example of that.
[time=1538] John was thrown into prison by Herod Antipas just for yelling and screaming by the fact that you shouldn't be married to your brother's wife, which he had done.
[time=1547] And all John had to do is just say nothing.
[time=1550] And so Kelly says, last week, if you want to avoid persecution, then just keep your mouth shut.
[time=1556] And that's all John had to do is keep his mouth shut, but he didn't.
[time=1560] And a dancing girl at a party asks for his head and Herod delivers.
[time=1567] All because he wouldn't compromise to truth this.
[time=1570] So the applications friends are multiple.
[time=1574] But for you and I today, if we esteem him and put him in his proper perspective, then my life comes into focus.
[time=1580] If I become my focus, if I become the one who is esteemed, even through feeling sorry for myself, everything goes sideways, honest, everything.
[time=1589] Well, so let's keep moving, okay?
[time=1592] Jesus says, write this down.
[time=1593] Jesus point number two, Jesus as mourner.
[time=1596] Here we see an example, Luke 19.
[time=1598] Look there, if you would, Luke 19, 41.
[time=1601] Jesus as mourner, as we taught this several weeks ago, we talked about our willingness to mourn, to grieve, to be remorseful, deeply, over sin.
[time=1610] Sin of the world, our own personal sin.
[time=1613] Look at this great example from the life of our Lord.
[time=1616] When he approached verse 41, Luke 19.
[time=1618] When he approached Jerusalem, it says he saw the city and wept over it, saying, if you had known, if you had known in this day, even you the things which make for peace, me in other words, if you had accepted me, if you had bowed the knee of your heart to me, if you had listened to what I had offered, if you were open in your heart and life, the things I had called you to, if you had known in this day, even you the things which make for peace.
[time=1646] But now, because you haven't, because you rejected me, but now they have been hidden from your eyes.
[time=1654] Jesus approaches Jerusalem any weeps.
[time=1657] What makes you weep?
[time=1658] What makes you, what makes you cry?
[time=1662] Does sin question there really is?
[time=1664] Does sin, does that which is contrary to God?
[time=1668] Does that which is postured against what's true and right and good?
[time=1672] Does that make you cry?
[time=1674] Is your heart stirred that deeply?
[time=1677] Is mine over the sin that you and I experience and see
[time=1683] and live in the midst of?
[time=1684] Why doesn't it mean that much to us?
[time=1690] Why in essence would we just conclude, you know, I mean, I'm kind of answering for you, I'm sort of answering for me, but the bottom line is it's not that big a deal to us.
[time=1700] Not that, it's not that big a deal.
[time=1702] It was that big a deal to him.
[time=1704] He mourned, he wept over the state of these people.
[time=1709] He says you'll be happy when you mourn.
[time=1712] What do you think, Steve?
[time=1715] Jesus in Luke 19 goes on to say that they didn't know the time of their visitation and the Romans are gonna come in 80, 70, not 30 some years later and leave not one stone upon another 'cause they did not know the time of their visitation.
[time=1730] I have another quote from Blaise Pascal that didn't get you in the first service, bonus coverage for you guys, no extra charge.
[time=1739] God is none other than the savior of our wretchedness.
[time=1743] So we can only know God well by knowing our iniquities.
[time=1746] Those who have known God without knowing their wretchedness have not glorified him, they've glorified themselves.
[time=1753] Two mourn is to experience sadness as the result of a condition and Jesus sees the condition of Jerusalem and he weeps because they will shout crucify him, probably not many hours from that very moment.
[time=1769] He did not know the day of their visitation.
[time=1774] In John's gospel Lazarus dies before Jesus gets there and he weeps.
[time=1780] The source verse in the New Testament, Jesus wept.
[time=1782] Why did he weep?
[time=1784] Death, destruction, hardheartedness, ears that would not hear that makes him weep.
[time=1790] And I believe very much friends that as mourners we have to understand that those in our lives that do not know that very same Jesus, we ought to mourn over their sin for them and beg God that he would work his miracle of reconciliation in their lives.
[time=1807] He's very good at doing that.
[time=1809] He does it every day, all the time.
[time=1811] So the application for us by way of mourning is to be like Jesus, to be solemn, humble and serious minded people about the things that he was serious about.
[time=1821] He wasn't flippant about any of these things.
[time=1824] He took them very, very seriously.
[time=1827] Moving forward friends, to Jesus as the one who is meek or gentle.
[time=1833] In Zechariah chapter nine there is a prophecy fulfilled in Matthew 21 of the triumphal entry.
[time=1840] Now read one verse of it for you and then that Kelly talked to you about it.
[time=1843] Matthew 21.5 says this, quoting Zechariah nine.
[time=1847] Say to the daughter of Zion, behold, your king is coming to you, humble and mounted on a donkey and on a colt, the full of a beast of burden.
[time=1861] Kelly, Jesus is meek.
[time=1863] Meek the word there is, and we told you this several weeks ago, the word is Prowse, P-R-A-O-S, but it's pronounced Prowse, not being, listen, not being overly impressed with oneself, not being overly impressed with one's accomplishments, one's status.
[time=1881] This is a meekness, this is a softness in spirit, this is one who wants to, doesn't have to, but wants to fly under the radar.
[time=1890] This is somebody who postures themselves with a gentle spirit, with a quiet behind the scenes doing whatever they can, but not flaunting it.
[time=1900] And I want you just this morning to realize, first he says you'll be happy when you take that part, you'll be happy when your meek and gentle culture says the other, you'll be happy when you're behind the scenes, you'll be happy when you're back in the back serving.
[time=1917] And I want to say this to you, man, who watched the opening ceremony of the Olympics?
[time=1926] Raise your hand, raise your hand if you saw the opening ceremony of the Olympics, unbelievable, absolutely amazing what they did there in those three or four hours.
[time=1937] I mean, the pageantry and the lights and the splendor and the choreography and the beauty and the magnificence.
[time=1946] I mean, I sat there and watched most of it, not all of it.
[time=1949] And I was absolutely, I've been around for a while, we've all seen special effects, we've all seen stage stuff.
[time=1955] I sat there that night, absolutely floored by the absolute beauty and majesty and grandeur of the thing.
[time=1965] And I think about him, I think about our Lord and how he came into Jerusalem on a what?
[time=1971] On a donkey.
[time=1973] And he was so much bigger than the Olympics, right?
[time=1981] He was so much more important than the gold medal.
[time=1984] He was so much more majestic.
[time=1987] He had such capacity in that moment, he could have come into Jerusalem.
[time=1992] I mean, my goodness, folks, it could have blown them away.
[time=1996] But he's meek and he's gentle and he comes in on a mule.
[time=2002] And in doing so gives you and I a great example of how we're to harness and hold back that desire to self-promote.
[time=2013] And he says you'll be happy when you're gentle.
[time=2017] And that's something for you and I to hold on to.
[time=2020] Jesus says, "Hungry and thirsty." Steve, go ahead.
[time=2023] I would say about meekness, Kelly.
[time=2026] It says they'll inherit the earth.
[time=2027] That's better than eight gold medals, I would say.
[time=2029] Yes, inheriting the earth.
[time=2030] Inheriting the earth is a bit better.
[time=2032] Yeah, hats off to the eight gold medals.
[time=2034] No kidding, no doubt about that.
[time=2036] But yeah, keep it in perspective.
[time=2038] Haring the earth is pretty cool.
[time=2039] Yes.
[time=2040] Anyway, Jesus as hungry and thirsty.
[time=2043] John chapter two, go ahead and write that down.
[time=2046] John chapter two versus 13 through 17.
[time=2050] The scene is the clearing of the temple.
[time=2053] Jesus is walking through, there's a portion of the temple in the outer course where the Gentiles and could walk, the only part they could come through, the core of the Gentiles and they'd set up shop, literally, set up shop in that part of the temple and the Gentiles could not worship there.
[time=2069] Physically could not worship and so this is his reaction.
[time=2072] The Passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[time=2076] In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons and the money changers sitting there.
[time=2083] Making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple with the sheep and oxen and poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
[time=2091] He told those who sold the pigeons, "Take these things away.
[time=2095] "Do not make my father's house a house of trade." His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will consume me."
[time=2110] This has been going on for a long time, this temple court behavior, but Jesus sees it and he goes, "Absolutely not, no way.
[time=2118] "Another way he could have avoided conflict "and once everybody beat fine and it's no big deal." It was a big deal.
[time=2124] Both the words for Hungary and Thirsty, their friends in Matthew five, have to do with this strong desire, this urge to be met.
[time=2133] And I was talking with a friend of mine recently about his life and what he is trying to do to meet the goals that every one of us has to be fulfilled, to be satisfied.
[time=2146] I discovered that in his life there is a tremendous break between what he wants and needs and the ways he's trying to get to what he wants and the ways he's trying to get to what he needs.
[time=2159] He'll never get there.
[time=2162] What a beautiful promise that they'll be satisfied.
[time=2167] In the person of Jesus, all those strivings cease.
[time=2173] In the person and only in the person of Jesus.
[time=2177] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be satisfied.
[time=2184] I read this quote a few weeks ago.
[time=2186] I'm gonna read it again quickly for you, Clarence Jordan and cotton candy righteousness.
[time=2191] Here we go.
[time=2193] One might be the superficial cotton candy righteousness vended by the professional religious hucksters and never have his hunger assuaged, satisfied.
[time=2203] Or he might drink and drink of their holy water and never have his thirst quenched, but the kingdom righteousness is meat indeed and drink indeed rich, nourishing and satisfying.
[time=2215] Psalm 84 says, "Better is one day in your courts "than a thousand elsewhere." Say amen to that.
[time=2223] Tell me, moving on, Jesus is the merciful one.
[time=2226] - Yeah, and just real quick before we move on, just a reminder to all of us, and I'm sure many of you have seen this and heard this and maybe even experienced it yourself, but in 22 years of ministry, I can't tell you how again and again, it's so powerful and so unbelievable to sit in conversations with people, and I have for years to sit in a conversation with someone who's an alcoholic and to talk with them about why they drink and to be able to articulate to them as they talk about the real reasons why they drink, to be able to articulate to them how those real needs and those desires that lead them there can be met in him, to talk to somebody addicted to eating, to talk about why they eat food when they do and to the extent that they do and to help someone stuck on food, understand that a physical hunger and a move toward the refrigerator can actually come back and be tied to things that Jesus can provide in relationship with them.
[time=2291] Just incredible, the everyday issues of life, my friends, money, pornography, power, to talk with people and to help them connect their desire for those things and that which Christ can do to fulfill every part of that need.
[time=2308] Jesus is merciful, would you look at Luke 23, Jesus is merciful, Luke 23, what I pass, so many examples of this, my friends, so many places that we could go to give you an example of his merciful spirit, but none as powerful as what you see on the screen there, Luke 23, 34, Jesus was saying, but Jesus was saying, Father, Jesus was saying this as he hung on the what, as he hung on the cross, Jesus is on the cross, Jesus has been whipped, Jesus has been spit on, Jesus has been punched, Jesus has been beaten, he's near the end of his physical life here, he's gonna die any moment, these things come into a bloody gruesome ending and Jesus was saying, Father, what, say it out loud, forgive them, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing, Father, forgive them, for they do not know, for they do not know what they are doing, forgive them, you and I, as we think about this, you and I, as you think about your posture, and as I think about my posture, when I encounter ignorance and all that it does, when I encounter hatred and all that it does, when I encounter jealousy and all that it does, when I encounter division and strife and gossip and all that it brings, what's your posture, what's your response and mind going to be, when we bump up against, they do not know what they do, and he forgave them, and you and I, here we go, you and I can be happy, it's completely counterculture, it's completely counterintuitive, but the fact is we can be happy when we forgive, again, and again, and again, and what, and again.
[time=2413] Peter asked Jesus, remember Matthew 18,
[time=2419] Peter asked Jesus, Jesus, Lord, how many times should we forgive someone who sinned against us?
[time=2425] And Jesus' response, do you remember?
[time=2427] His response to Peter was 70 times seven, was what he said there in Matthew 18.
[time=2432] You're to forgive 70 times seven, and Stephen and I were talking about it this week, and we wanted to just remind all of you again, that that was a, that was just an expression that Jesus used, he wasn't meaning 490 times.
[time=2445] In the, in the vernacular of that day, 70 times seven would be for us today, it would be like him saying a gazillion, you know, quadruple billion, when you're a kid, you used to talk about, you know, big numbers, and you'd come up with all kinds of ways of saying, you know, that, well, that's what Jesus is saying here.
[time=2463] Your willingness in mind, a gazillion times to forgive, and when we're willing to take that posture, he says our souls will be blissfully content, macarias.
[time=2477] Jesus is pure in heart, let's keep going.
[time=2481] Jesus as pure in heart, what a great example.
[time=2485] He gives us of this in a number of different places.
[time=2488] My friends, when we talked about pure in heart several weeks ago, we talked about one's willingness to run from sin.
[time=2493] We talked about one's willingness to distance ourselves from the sin, or even the things that lead to sin.
[time=2500] We talked about this freedom that comes and this purity that exists when we posture ourselves in ways that are far away from sin as we can possibly get.
[time=2511] And I love what we see in our Lord.
[time=2515] I love how he handled the temptation.
[time=2518] Turn there if you would to Matthew chapter four.
[time=2520] Here we see him and his pure heart at work.
[time=2524] Not only do I love this beatitude, I love the promise of it, for we shall, the pure in heart shall see God, I love that.
[time=2532] But look at Matthew four.
[time=2533] It says in Matthew four, one and two, you see it on the screen there.
[time=2538] It says, "Then Jesus was led up by the spirit "into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil." Verse two, it says, "And after he had fasted 40 days "and 40 nights, he then became hungry." I always love that, it's like no kidding.
[time=2552] Really, he got hungry.
[time=2556] And sometimes we read past that kind of quick.
[time=2558] Stop and don't read past that quickly this morning.
[time=2560] Stop and think about that.
[time=2562] This encounter with Satan himself comes on the heels of 40 days with nothing.
[time=2570] And he's hungry, hungry for what?
[time=2575] Hungry for food, yes.
[time=2577] But I think he's hungering and thirsting after what's right as well.
[time=2582] Keep going, verse three.
[time=2583] It says there in verse three of Matthew four.
[time=2585] It says, "And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the son of God, commandment, "these stones become bread." And what does he say?
[time=2590] Go to verse four, it says in verse four.
[time=2592] But he answered, "Instead it is written, "'Man shall not live on bread alone, "but on every word that proceeds "out of the mouth of God." Temptation one, dealt with, boom.
[time=2601] Keep going, verse five.
[time=2603] We're gonna pick up the pace here a little bit.
[time=2605] Then the devil took him into the holy city and had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple.
[time=2609] Way, way, way up there.
[time=2610] Keep going, verse six.
[time=2612] Says to him, "If you are the son of God, "throw yourself down, for it is written, "he will command his angels concerning you, "and on their hands they will bear you up "so that you will not strike your foot against the stone." Satan using a little bit of the scriptures there to kind of counter punch.
[time=2626] But Jesus says to him, "On the other hand, "it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord, "your God to the," what?
[time=2633] To the test.
[time=2634] Temptation two, boom, dealt with.
[time=2637] Distancing himself.
[time=2638] Temptation three comes, and again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
[time=2644] And in verse nine said to him, "All these things I will give to you "if you fall down and worship me." Jesus, fall down and worship me Satan.
[time=2653] And Jesus said to him, "Go, enough of you.
[time=2658] "Be gone, Satan, for it is written, "You shall," and I certainly will, as if he's saying that, "You shall worship the Lord, "your God, and serve him only." Before Steve says something about this, I wanna just say this, do you notice how with each temptation he had a, what?
[time=2678] A response.
[time=2681] With each temptation he had something to say.
[time=2685] Do you have something to say?
[time=2687] You will be tempted today.
[time=2691] You and I will be tempted tonight.
[time=2693] Sometimes we even know where it's gonna come from.
[time=2695] We've talked about that.
[time=2696] Are you prepared?
[time=2697] Do you have what you're going to say ready?
[time=2702] Jesus didn't mull it over.
[time=2704] Jesus didn't ask for a timeout to go think it through.
[time=2708] He had a response.
[time=2710] He had something to say and what he said was the truth.
[time=2713] Steve, what are you thinking?
[time=2716] I'm thinking that he quotes, what place are the three quotes from?
[time=2720] I'm Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy.
[time=2723] He knows Deuteronomy like that.
[time=2726] We can cop out and say, "Well, he's Jesus." Of course he knows it.
[time=2729] Well, that's not, that's too simple.
[time=2731] He got high marks in Awana.
[time=2732] He did.
[time=2733] Maybe really grace.
[time=2735] Lots of patches.
[time=2736] I have one thing to say with regard to application from Second Timothy, I'll read these verses with you.
[time=2741] Second Timothy chapter two verses 22 through 26 and please in the balcony, you guys over here, the young youthful people in the audience, just listen carefully, especially you guys.
[time=2752] So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
[time=2763] Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies.
[time=2767] You know they breed quarrels and the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness?
[time=2778] God may perhaps grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil after being captured by him to do his will.
[time=2791] There's a lot in those verses about being serious and about being sober minded and about being peaceful and all the rest, but pure in heart friends, the application is flee youthful passions, juvenile passions.
[time=2804] That's what not to do, what do I do?
[time=2808] Pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace.
[time=2811] If you only say no to things, never put anything in its place, you're gonna block around one leg, spiritually speaking your whole life.
[time=2818] Why don't you do any of that?
[time=2820] I must be good, no, no.
[time=2823] Peace maker, Jesus as peacemaker, moving right along.
[time=2830] In Luke 19, we have the story of Zacchaeus who was a wee little man.
[time=2835] In Zacchaeus, Jesus says to Zacchaeus, Zacchaeus, I must come to your house, I was telling the color of that.
[time=2842] I must come to your house today.
[time=2844] I love that about him.
[time=2845] I must come to your house today.
[time=2848] The story of Zacchaeus ends in Luke 19, starting in verse nine.
[time=2851] And Jesus said to him, that is Zacchaeus.
[time=2853] Today, salvation has come to your house, Zacchaeus.
[time=2857] Since you're son of Abraham, the son of man came to seek and to save the lost.
[time=2864] Second Corinthians five, some of my favorite verses in the New Testament.
[time=2867] I'm gonna go to second Corinthians five, starting in verse 16.
[time=2871] Write that down if you would please and go back and take a look at it this week.
[time=2875] Peace making is about reconciliation, reconciling people who have disagreements.
[time=2880] From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh, even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.
[time=2889] Therefore, if anyone's in Christ, he's a new creation.
[time=2893] The old is passed away, hold the new is come.
[time=2896] All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.
[time=2905] That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not kind of their trespasses against them.
[time=2912] And entrusting to us the message, the ministry of reconciliation, peace.
[time=2918] We've been entrusted with that ministry.
[time=2920] So being a peacemaker, friends, the application for that, the takeaway for you and I is to be a peacemaker in so far as we are ministers of reconciliation.
[time=2930] The world is alienated, cut off from God outside of Jesus.
[time=2935] They have to know that from us gently, respectfully, truthfully, lovingly, all of it.
[time=2943] I wanted to show this quote when I spoke on peacemaking earlier in the summer.
[time=2948] I've been honored to be a part of this series.
[time=2949] I must tell you, it's been a tremendous, tremendous blessing to me.
[time=2954] John R.W. Stott, he wrote a book called The Cross of Christ, which is a transformational book I recommend it to you, highly, it's from a different book on the sermon and the mount, but I offer it to you quickly.
[time=2967] Now peacemaking is a divine work for peace means reconciliation.
[time=2972] And God is the author of peace and reconciliation.
[time=2975] So it's highly surprising that the particular blessing, which attaches to peacemakers, is that they may be called sons of God.
[time=2981] For they are seeking to do what their father has done, loving people with his love, peacemakers.
[time=2989] Last two weeks, tell us when talking to us about those who are persecuted, insulted, falsely accused, because of what's right.
[time=2997] And he's gonna end up just unpacking that force again this morning.
[time=3002] I'll get right to it.
[time=3003] Let me just ask you this.
[time=3004] Again, he says you'll be happy.
[time=3007] You'll be really, truly happy.
[time=3011] When you're one who gives yourself to bringing things together, when you're one who gives yourself to bringing people together, when you're one who gives yourself to bringing spiritually speaking people toward God, when you're one who doesn't make things worse by what you say, you don't make things more destructive by what you continue to pass along.
[time=3035] No, you're one who brings peace and makes things better.
[time=3039] You'll be happy.
[time=3041] See, sometimes we think we'll be happy when we feel, sometimes we think we'll be happy when we further something because we're mad at somebody and we want them to hurt and we want this thing to get messy so that somehow we think we're gonna be happy when they're not happy.
[time=3060] And kids do that and adults do that, we all do that.
[time=3065] And he says you're gonna be happy when you bring peace, when you help restore and reconcile and make strong again.
[time=3073] So be happy and be engaged in the process of bringing things together.
[time=3080] Lastly, Jesus is as insulted.
[time=3083] And if you would, just for time's sake, I wanna have you write down Mark 23.
[time=3087] I'm sorry, Mark 3, Mark 3 22 and 27.
[time=3093] And we won't read the whole thing, but I'll just tell you quickly.
[time=3096] I mean, if there was one thing somebody could have said to Jesus, if there was the worst thing he could have ever imagined having someone say to him.
[time=3105] I mean, you think about it.
[time=3106] Think about the worst thing somebody could ever say to you.
[time=3109] The thing that would be to you most offensive.
[time=3112] The thing that to you would be most hurtful.
[time=3114] The thing to you that would just get the furthest under your skin as anything could possibly get.
[time=3124] And they said to him and Mark 3, they said, "You're Satan." Jesus, they said, "You're Satan, that's who you are." And the Scriptures say happy, content blissfully joyful
[time=3142] at the level of the soul are those who are insulted or righteousness sake or his sake.
[time=3151] And whether it's persecution or slander or mistreatment, we've learned over the last couple of weeks that there's an opportunity for you and I in the midst of that to be truly, truly at peace.
[time=3161] But the only way that we're ever gonna be at peace, the only way we're ever gonna be, listen now, the only way we're ever gonna be truly happy is when we know him, is when things are right with him.
[time=3176] And I wanna give you a chance this morning.
[time=3180] We wanna give our family an opportunity.
[time=3182] To give some thought, we're gonna give you a few minutes here.
[time=3185] I'm gonna have Corbin come on up and I'm gonna ask you if you would, did you just sit still for a moment?
[time=3189] Maybe just sit quietly.
[time=3191] And as Corbin comes up, I want Steve to read this quote to you.
[time=3193] You can follow along on the screen if you would.
[time=3196] Steve, read this quote to him and then I'm gonna invite all of you to give some thought to some things that we wanna do here this morning.
[time=3201] - Well, he's Pascal again.
[time=3205] What does this desire and this inability of ours proclaim to us but that there was once in man, a genuine happiness of which nothing now survives but the mark and the empty outline.
[time=3219] And this he vainly tries to fill from everything that lies around him, seeking from things that are not there, the help that he does not get from those that are present.
[time=3229] Yet they are quite incapable of filling the gap because this infinite gulf can only be filled by an infinite and immutable object.
[time=3239] That is God himself.
[time=3242] - Well, here's what I wanna, Steve and I wanna just say to you this morning, just two things, kind of two groups of people that we wanna address and give you a chance to respond to all of this that you've heard over this entire summer.
[time=3257] There are some in the room this morning and you really do know him.
[time=3263] I mean, there are many of you in the room this morning and there was a time in your life and maybe it was recent, maybe it was two, three years ago and maybe it was 30 years ago but there are some in the room and you know the Lord, you bow the knee of your heart and you fully surrendered your heart and life to him and you made a commitment to follow after him.
[time=3284] And we've spent nine weeks talking about how in relationship with him you can be truly and absolutely happy.
[time=3293] And the truth of the matter is you're here today and you're not.
[time=3297] Be truthful.
[time=3301] You're not.
[time=3304] You're just not.
[time=3307] You're not content and you're not at peace and to cut to the chase this morning for time's sake, you and I understand that that happens when there's things in between us and him.
[time=3319] It happens when we've made choices and when we've made decisions.
[time=3324] It happens when sin inhabits that have formed block that intimacy with him, that intimacy within which we get to be happy.
[time=3333] And so we wanna give you an opportunity this morning with great honesty and with great courage.
[time=3339] We wanna give you the chance to make that right.
[time=3341] And if you know him this morning but you're not experiencing that happiness at all, we're gonna give you a chance to come on down front here and we're gonna have our elders and deacons and staff people and others just willing and ready to pray with you.
[time=3354] You willing to come down and say, hey, I'm not happy and I know why.
[time=3360] It's this and you're not confessing your sin to us.
[time=3365] We confess our sin to God but we find great strength and encouragement when we confess those sins with each other and we pray for each other and we identify with each other and we stand with each other.
[time=3377] So come this morning in a moment and do that in all honesty and with all the courage that God will give you and be happy again.
[time=3386] Others of you in the room, you know what?
[time=3390] We're so thankful that you're here and you've been here on a journey and you're trying to figure out what it means to live in a relationship with God and you haven't surrendered your heart to him and the truth is you haven't had a day in your life of being happy.
[time=3408] Or you've tried this and this and this and that but as you've listened, you've come to this realization that you've never been happy at all and that the one thing that God offers you in order to experience that happiness is his son and this morning you can come.
[time=3422] You know, walk right down here and we'll talk with you and we'll pray with you and we'll introduce you to the happy one who can make you happy, who can fill every part of your heart and soul and we can help you today and in the days and weeks and months to come Lord willing know what it means to walk with him.
[time=3440] Thank you for being here this morning.
[time=3441] It's been a joy and a privilege.
[time=3442] Father, we're grateful for your truth.
[time=3445] Thankful for the example of your son, the one who was truly happy and God as we give ourselves to following after him.
[time=3454] Oh God, we pray that you would give a strength and courage to do that with great obedience and faithfulness.
[time=3462] Thank you for the gift of your spirit and the help that he brings.
[time=3467] God, thank you for the gift of your word and the direction it brings.
[time=3471] And oh God, thanks for your people and the encouragement that they offer.
[time=3475] We love you God, we're thankful for you and we look forward to being together again soon.
[time=3481] Your son's name, we pray, amen.
[time=3484] (upbeat music)
