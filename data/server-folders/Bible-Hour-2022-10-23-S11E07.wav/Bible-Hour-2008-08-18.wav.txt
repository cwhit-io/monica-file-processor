[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again everybody, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] My name's Kelly Bird and I serve as senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and we're so thankful that you've tuned in again today.
[time=41] The message that you're going to hear today is really a powerful message.
[time=45] I'm so thankful for Tony Opeliger, one of the young men on our elder board and a graduate of Black Hawk Christian School years ago who now is married and leading his own family and a part of our family here at Black Hawk and on the staff over at Taylor University Fort Wayne.
[time=63] He's a terrific young man, a great friend and a gifted teacher and I'm so thankful that Tony joined me for this message and the message is about the deep love and commitment that God has for his people, this love that God has, this commitment he has to make things new.
[time=82] It's a message about the justice of God and justice oftentimes in our minds means retribution.
[time=89] It means righting a wrong and in a sense that's very true biblically but there's also another part of justice which has to do with God's heart for that which isn't right, for God's heart for that which is broken or shattered and there's this great picture throughout all of scripture of God coming along and wanting to make whole again and healthy again and right again that which has been made wrong.
[time=114] So I hope you'll be encouraged and as I thought about it this morning, it really leads us into a discussion and a series that I want to invite you to come and be a part of and listen to.
[time=126] When God makes a person whole, when spiritually God makes someone new, we say that they've been saved.
[time=134] We say that that person is now a Christian, a follower of Christ and I want to ask you this question, what does a follower of Christ, what does a Christian look like, really think about it, what is a Christian?
[time=149] I mean, it sounds very basic I know but I'll tell you what if you talk about it at the lunchroom table today, if you talk about it with your family, if you ask that question to any number of people today in your world or in mine, you would get a number of different answers, what is a Christian?
[time=167] What do they look like?
[time=168] How do they live?
[time=169] What do they value?
[time=170] So many times I think we turn to other sources, other places of opinion for the answer to that and I want to just tell you at Blackhawk in recent days, we've come back to this question.
[time=181] What is a true genuine follower of Christ really look like?
[time=185] What's really true about them and their priorities and their heart and their values?
[time=191] And we've gone not to opinion but we've just come back to the scriptures and beginning Sunday, September 7th, I'll begin a series describing those things that we found.
[time=200] The basic foundational traits of one who genuinely is following after the Lord.
[time=206] Obviously it's not perfection but I think there are some things we've seen in the gospels and the book of Acts that have reminded us here at Blackhawk of what a true genuine follower of Christ looks like and I can't wait to share that with you.
[time=221] So tune in, beginning September 7th or better yet come and be with us.
[time=224] We'd love to have you here as we tackle this incredibly important question of what it looks like to truly and absolutely follow Christ with one's heart in life.
[time=234] Thanks for tuning in.
[time=235] I hope you're encouraged today and as always, we'd love to see you soon, we'd love to meet you and get to know you better.
[time=241] God bless you and have a great week.
[time=243] - Oh, like I said, it's great to be together again.
[time=246] I want you all to just give me a couple minutes here to just welcome this young man standing next to me.
[time=253] He is not only a good friend but part of our elder team here at Blackhawk and his name is Tony Opleger.
[time=259] Everybody say hi, Tony.
[time=260] (audience laughs) - Hi church.
[time=263] - Tony's been literally, Tony's been around here since the day he was born.
[time=268] It's the honest truth.
[time=269] His folks were here at Blackhawk.
[time=273] He was born here, he grew up here.
[time=276] God did some great things in his life, brought a lot of great people along to invest in him.
[time=282] Went off to college, grew up a little bit, came back, got involved in this community.
[time=288] He's now currently the campus chaplain at Taylor University.
[time=294] God's doing some really, really encouraging things through Tony and that team with those college students and he loves what he gets to do.
[time=302] He's been married for how long?
[time=303] - Two years.
[time=304] - Married for two years to Hannah and we're so thankful that he and Hannah are part of our family and he serves you as an elder.
[time=312] He loves what he gets to do as do I.
[time=315] He has a number of ministry involvements around here over the years and even currently but he's also gifted, God's gifted him as a teacher and we are in the business around here of doing everything we can to help people use their gifts and so I'm really thankful that Tony's here this morning and I'm really, really looking forward to what we're gonna be able to talk about this morning and let me say this to you about that.
[time=339] You need to hear this.
[time=346] I know most of you.
[time=348] I don't know all of you but I know us.
[time=352] Does that make sense?
[time=353] I know us and we need to hear this.
[time=358] You and I need to hear this individually and this church needs to hear this as a family.
[time=366] What God has put on Tony's heart and he's allowed me to kind of share in it with him.
[time=371] This is a message that we were privileged to do together over in Kenya in Nairobi this last April and he put it on both of our hearts to just come back and when the time was right be able to bring this message to our family and so for those of you in the room, for those of you listening online, for those of you watching the broadcast, I believe down deep in my soul that this is a message that you and I need to hear today and this is something that we need to as a family give great thought and attention and I think activity toward him.
[time=400] So please listen and Tony's going to get us going with a question.
[time=406] - Yes, but first I'd like to say thank you for those kind words and I'm-- - You're welcome.
[time=411] - Over the last few weeks I've thought about this and prayed about it a lot and I really, I have not been able to find the words to describe what an honor it is for me to serve our body in this way.
[time=424] One thing Kelly said that was a little bit wrong is my family moved right next door to Black Hawk in 1978 and through the ministry here, through the Christian school and the church family, we all came to give our lives a following Jesus.
[time=441] So it is an unspeakable honor for me to be standing serving this way today.
[time=446] So I want you to know my heart is humbled and filled with gratitude and I also want to say that God is faithful, but we do want to start with a question this morning and we're actually just with the people right next to you when I have you interact for 30 seconds to a minute and the question is this, what does God love?
[time=466] What does God, what does our God love?
[time=470] I want you just to jump right in 30 seconds to a minute with the person right next to you and start brainstorming answers to that question.
[time=476] What does God love?
[time=482] Keep in mind the things that you just heard and the things you just said in answering the question, what does God love?
[time=490] Hold on to those.
[time=491] We're going to come back to it in a moment, but before we do, I want to have just a really brief history lesson.
[time=496] I want to go back in time to the timeframe between 750 and 700-ish BC during the time of the prophet Isaiah.
[time=506] And during that timeframe, God's people had been divided into a northern kingdom and a southern kingdom.
[time=511] The northern kingdom was known as Israel and the southern kingdom as Judah and they'd been that way for a couple centuries.
[time=518] And if you were to pick up a newspaper from that timeframe, you would see that it was a time of darkness and brokenness.
[time=526] It was a time of darkness and brokenness certainly from the outside of their land, specifically the Assyrian empire was gaining in military strength and power and was taking over peoples and lands.
[time=538] And in fact, in 722 BC, the Assyrian empire conquered the northern kingdom Israel and exiled most of the people out.
[time=547] And then for the next couple of decades, they threatened to do the very same thing to the southern kingdom, Judah.
[time=553] But it was also a time of darkness and brokenness from the inside of their society.
[time=561] Their society was filled with evil and rebellion.
[time=563] It was filled with all kinds of wrong worship and it was filled with injustice.
[time=570] The rich and the rulers of the land were proud and the poor and the marginalized among them were being abused.
[time=579] And so it wasn't to this context of darkness and brokenness that God sent some of his prophets.
[time=586] He sent Amos, Micah, Hosea, and he sent Isaiah during this timeframe.
[time=592] And these prophets, including Isaiah, really spoke two kinds of words.
[time=597] They spoke words of rebuke to the people and of a warning of a coming judgment.
[time=605] But they also spoke words of hope and of the promise of a restoration.
[time=612] Words of rebuke and words of hope.
[time=616] And Isaiah 61 is one of those places in the prophet Isaiah where we can go and see a beautiful picture of the promised restoration that God has in store.
[time=627] And so to honor God and just in recognition of the fact that we are about to read his very words, would you please stand with us and we're gonna read from Isaiah 61.
[time=640] And as I read this, just keep in mind the context,
[time=648] the darkness and the brokenness and think about God restoring in this way.
[time=654] Isaiah 61, starting in verse one.
[time=656] "The spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me "because the Lord has anointed me "to preach good news to the poor.
[time=663] "He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted "to proclaim freedom for the captives "and release from darkness for the prisoners.
[time=670] "To proclaim the year of the Lord's favor "and the day of vengeance of our God.
[time=675] "To comfort all who mourn and provide "for those who grieve in Zion.
[time=679] "To bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, "the oil of gladness instead of mourning, "and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.
[time=688] "They will be called oaks of righteousness, "a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.
[time=695] "They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore "the places long devastated.
[time=701] "They will renew the ruined cities "that have been devastated for generations.
[time=706] "Aliens will shepherd your flocks.
[time=707] "Our foreigners will work your fields and vineyards.
[time=710] "And you will be called priests of the Lord.
[time=714] "You will be named ministers of our God.
[time=716] "You will feed on the wealth of nations "and in their riches you will boast.
[time=720] "Instead of their shame, my people will receive "a double portion, and instead of disgrace, "they will rejoice in their inheritance, "and so they will inherit a double portion in their land, "and everlasting joy will be theirs." And here we go, verse eight.
[time=737] For I, the Lord, love, justice.
[time=742] The Lord, our God, loves justice.
[time=747] I don't know how many of you as your brainstorming answers to that question, what does God love said, justice?
[time=753] But here in Isaiah 61, eight, and then in a couple places in the Psalms, it explicitly says that our God loves justice.
[time=761] And so this morning we wanna talk about the kind of justice our God loves.
[time=766] So let's pray together and ask Him to bless the rest of our time.
[time=769] Father, we come to you together,
[time=775] and we ask that you would please give us a clearer picture of who you are.
[time=782] Please stir up our hearts to be the people you want us to be.
[time=787] And please, God, we want to have a real encounter with you
[time=794] so that we might be transformed.
[time=796] May it be to the praise of your glory.
[time=798] In the name of Jesus, our King, we pray.
[time=801] [AMEN] You may be seated.
[time=803] - Well, you see there in a powerful way, just in that one phrase in Isaiah 61, how our God loves justice.
[time=811] Let me just take a minute if I can, grab your pens and follow along on your notes sheet.
[time=815] If you would, I wanna just show you, Tony, and I wanna show you a few other places in the Old Testament scripture, specifically where we get this notion and we see this great truth of our God's love for justice.
[time=827] Right down Psalm 11-7, would you Psalm 11-7 says this, for the Lord is righteous, he loves justice.
[time=835] Upright men will see his face, Psalm 33-5, the theme continues, it says he loves righteousness and justice.
[time=844] The earth is full of the loving kindness of the Lord, and Psalm 99 verse four, same thing there, the strength of the King loves justice, the strength of the King loves justice, Psalm 99-4, you can fill in the blank there, God my friends, he loves justice.
[time=862] Deuteronomy 10-17, turn there if you would, what a powerful picture this is, of this idea of God's love for justice, Deuteronomy chapter 10, and we're gonna pick it up in verse 17 where it says, "For the Lord your God is the God of gods, "and the Lord of lords, the great, "the mighty and the awesome God who does not show partiality." It's a very important concept, and as we move on this morning you'll see this coming back again and again and again, not only in God's heart, but we hope in yours and in ours as well.
[time=897] He doesn't show partiality nor take a bribe, he executes verse 18, he executes justice for the orphan, and the widow, and shows his love, their love and justice being used synonymously, shows his love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.
[time=914] You can fill in the blank there, Yahweh executes, God executes justice.
[time=921] And then we won't read from there, but you can note Psalm 89, 14 and Psalm 97, 2, where it says in so many words that righteousness and justice are the foundations of his throne, it says.
[time=934] The very foundations of his throne, the writer there, the psalmist, uses that figurative language, the foundations of his throne to show that justice is part of the very underpinnings of who he is, his character, his kingship, he is a God who loves, he is a God who executes justice, he is a God who's throne.
[time=956] The very seat of his authority is established with righteousness and justice.
[time=963] Here's the concern, and I hope you'll just stay with us here.
[time=967] I really think while most of us would nod our heads to all that we've said so far, we've really, we have really, you have really, and I have really, and the church has really missed what this really, really, and I'll say fully means.
[time=983] So as Tony takes you into a full definition of what it means that God loves justice, more specifically what justice means, please listen,
[time=996] please listen.
[time=997] - The Hebrew word that is often translated justice
[time=1003] is michpot, michpot, or at least that's as close as I can get to pronouncing that Hebrew word correctly.
[time=1010] - It's a very good, very good pronunciation.
[time=1011] - Thank you.
[time=1013] It's used 41 times just in the prophet Isaiah alone, but it is really used clear throughout the Hebrew scriptures, which we call the Old Testament.
[time=1020] And as I have read some scholars and done some research and done a word study on this word michpot, the most basic definition I have found for michpot is this, michpot equals the restoration of a situation or environment.
[time=1036] It's used a number of different ways michpot is, but the most basic definition is the restoration of a situation or environment.
[time=1046] And really there's two parts to michpot.
[time=1049] Maybe what we wanna call a positive side and a negative side, and we as 21st century Americans when we hear the word justice, we tend to, I tend to think of the negative side of this word michpot, and that is punishment for evil.
[time=1067] Someone getting what they deserve for the evil they have committed.
[time=1071] That's what we think of when we think of justice.
[time=1073] Well, that is true, but it is not complete.
[time=1077] There's another positive side and a really significant side to this word, this concept of michpot, which we might call biblical justice, and that is this, fixing that which is broken.
[time=1089] Punishment for evil and fixing that which is broken.
[time=1095] Both of them must be brought together for a right understanding of justice as we read it in the scriptures.
[time=1103] We've got an illustration this morning that we're gonna show you here that I think we'll bring these two parts together.
[time=1113] If I were to take this-- - I just barely recovered from first hour on this.
[time=1117] - If I were to take this bat right here to Kelly's knee, actually he told me to be more aggressive this time.
[time=1123] So if I were to take this bat to his knee-- - To a certain point.
[time=1127] - Okay.
[time=1128] Well, I think I probably should confess that there's part of me that wants to really do this.
[time=1132] - Believe me, if you do, there's part of me on everyone.
[time=1137] (audience laughing) - Okay, so here we go.
[time=1141] If I just wind up, get loosened up, and I just hit Kelly in the knee.
[time=1145] The question is this, what is michpot?
[time=1149] What is biblical justice?
[time=1153] There's two parts to it.
[time=1154] First, yes, there's punishment for evil.
[time=1156] There's me getting punished for the evil I have just committed.
[time=1160] But that's not the whole picture.
[time=1163] The other part of justice, as we're talking about here today, the kind of justice that our God loves, is Kelly's knee being fixed.
[time=1172] Both of those must be brought together for a right understanding, for the restoration of a situation or environment.
[time=1180] Kelly's gonna talk a little bit about that first part of michpot, punishment for evil.
[time=1185] - Punishment for evil, judgment, justice defined.
[time=1188] You can write some of this down, justice defined.
[time=1191] Judgment against and punishment for evil.
[time=1194] Very good, very accurate definition of that side of the justice definition.
[time=1200] You might wanna write this down, retribution.
[time=1202] Oftentimes, when we think about justice, we think about retribution.
[time=1206] We think about the delivering of a consequence.
[time=1209] And when something evil has happened, when something wrong has taken place, and the retribution occurs, that the consequences get delivered, we oftentimes say it, justice has been served.
[time=1221] And this is not an inaccurate view.
[time=1223] This is a biblical view, but it is part, just part of the definition.
[time=1228] Some examples for you.
[time=1230] From the scriptures, you can write down Genesis 19.
[time=1232] Write down Genesis 19.
[time=1233] And Genesis 19, you and I read about a lady, Lot's wife.
[time=1238] Some of you know the story, some of you don't.
[time=1240] Lot and his family, his wife included, had been taking residence in a place called Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1246] God had chosen in his time and place that it was time to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1250] He gives Lot and his wife and their family a chance to run for the hills.
[time=1254] He gives them a chance to get out.
[time=1256] But God tells them very specifically, he says to them, do not what?
[time=1261] Do not look back.
[time=1264] It was a very serious thing to God.
[time=1265] And God was very serious when he said it.
[time=1267] And God was very clear when he said this very serious thing.
[time=1271] Do not look back.
[time=1273] And so they run for the hills.
[time=1274] God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah, and Lot's wife looks where?
[time=1279] And she becomes a pillar of, really, becomes a pillar of salt.
[time=1285] The delivering of a consequence.
[time=1289] An evil had occurred.
[time=1290] God had not been obeyed.
[time=1292] And justice, in that sense, is served.
[time=1296] You could write down Acts 5.
[time=1298] In Acts 5, we hear the story.
[time=1300] We read about Ananias and Sephira, this couple who had sold some of their property.
[time=1305] And they come before the apostles to give their money.
[time=1307] And in their heart, they're deceiving, attempting to deceive the apostles and ultimately God.
[time=1312] And whereas they say this is what we're bringing and it is a representation of our gift.
[time=1316] And we've held nothing back.
[time=1317] They did hold some back.
[time=1319] They lied to God.
[time=1320] They lied to the apostles.
[time=1321] And that day both Ananias and Sephira meet their death.
[time=1327] Die, right there.
[time=1329] God takes them on the spot for their deceitfulness.
[time=1333] Justice, in that sense, on that side of the definition, is served.
[time=1339] Retribution, the delivering of consequences.
[time=1342] But my friends, my friends, again, this is what we've missed.
[time=1345] The flip side of this powerful word.
[time=1348] The other part of the story, the other part of the definition.
[time=1352] And Tony's gonna take that and give it to you right now.
[time=1355] - Yeah, so again, the basic, most basic definition from each pot is the restoration of a situation or environment.
[time=1362] Kelly spoke about the first part, punishment for evil.
[time=1365] We've already mentioned this other part, fixing that which is broken.
[time=1370] And I think this fixing that which is broken makes a lot more sense when we kinda take a step back and look at the big picture.
[time=1378] We might call it the big story.
[time=1379] It's the story in which we find ourselves.
[time=1381] And be reminded here today, brothers and sisters, that our God created a world that was good and right and perfect.
[time=1391] It was completely filled with peace and with justice.
[time=1395] Everything was right.
[time=1397] And then in Genesis three, we have the account of humans entering into the rebellion against the good creator God.
[time=1405] And the result of that has been the world caught up in the downward spiral of evil and rebellion and brokenness.
[time=1414] And we can see that all over our world today.
[time=1417] If we were just to look at the paper, this is the Sunday morning paper from today, Sunday, August 24, 2008.
[time=1424] Doesn't take us long to look in here and see that our world is broken.
[time=1429] Page two has two articles, both of them about war, one of them in Georgia, the country of Georgia, and the other one in Iraq.
[time=1437] If you go to the metro section right here in our very own city and area, go to page two, you see the obituaries, our world is broken.
[time=1445] Go to page three, you see the felony report.
[time=1447] Our world is broken.
[time=1449] But we also need to be reminded here today, brothers and sisters, that our God is a redeemer and a restorer.
[time=1459] I heard two amends.
[time=1462] I wanna do that again.
[time=1464] And I would ask you to spontaneously say amen at the end of it.
[time=1468] (congregation laughing) We need to be, we also need to be reminded here today, brothers and sisters, that our God is a redeemer and a restorer.
[time=1480] - Amen. - Amen.
[time=1481] All throughout scripture, we see God's mission of redemption and restoration.
[time=1485] We see him, his mission to redeem a people and to restore that which has been broken.
[time=1491] Isaiah 61, which we read a few moments ago, is one of those many places that we can go to see God's heart to fix that which is broken.
[time=1500] So I think with this more full understanding of justice, biblical justice, to me, it makes more sense then, Isaiah 61, 8, that our God loves Mishpat, he loves justice.
[time=1513] And part of that, he loves to fix that which is broken.
[time=1517] Deuteronomy 10, which Kelly read from, God executes this kind of justice for the orphan and for the widow, he fixes that which is broken.
[time=1527] And it makes more sense, I think, in Psalm 89 and 97 that righteousness and Mishpat are part of the very foundations of our God's throne.
[time=1537] So biblical justice is important, first and foremost, because it's part of the very heart and character of our God.
[time=1545] But it's also important because it is something that God requires for his people.
[time=1552] He required, he has always required his people to do justice.
[time=1560] I mentioned that the prophets, including Isaiah spoke words of hope and of coming restoration, but they also spoke words of rebuke.
[time=1568] Well, Isaiah jumps right in in the very first part of his prophecy in Isaiah one with words of rebuke.
[time=1574] And he says this, starting in verse 13, stop bringing meaningless offerings.
[time=1580] Your incense is detestable to me.
[time=1582] New moons, sabbaths and convocations, I cannot bear your evil assemblies.
[time=1589] It's a strong language and it keeps getting stronger.
[time=1591] Your new moon festivals and your appointed feast, my soul hates.
[time=1596] They have become a burden to me.
[time=1598] I am weary of bearing them.
[time=1600] When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you.
[time=1604] Even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen.
[time=1608] So God's people can be doing a lot of religious things.
[time=1611] And he could still have this reaction if we're not doing certain things that he cares about continuing on.
[time=1619] Your hands are full of blood.
[time=1621] Wash and make yourselves clean.
[time=1623] Take your evil deeds out of my sight.
[time=1625] Stop doing wrong.
[time=1627] Learn to do right.
[time=1627] And here we go with the pinnacle of that.
[time=1629] Seek justice, seek mish pot, comma.
[time=1634] Encourage the oppressed.
[time=1637] Defend the cause of the fatherless.
[time=1639] Plead the case of the widow.
[time=1642] So God, through the prophet Isaiah, rebuked his people for not doing justice, especially for those who are in need in their society.
[time=1651] And throughout scripture, we see a really strong link between biblical justice and those who are oppressed and widowed and fatherless and in need.
[time=1665] And I think that this makes more sense again when we take a step back, like many other individual passages of scripture, when we step back and look at the big story.
[time=1673] Because in a sense, these people who are in need and who are marginalized are those who have been hardest hit by the Genesis three fall.
[time=1683] These are the people who have the most pain and the most brokenness and the most need.
[time=1689] And at the same time, and this is key, they are the ones with the least power to do anything about it.
[time=1696] So God sent his prophets to rebuke the people and to instruct them, do justice.
[time=1703] Do this kind of justice that I love.
[time=1706] It was his desire then for his people to do justice and it is his desire today that his people would be about this kind of justice.
[time=1716] And we could go all around the world.
[time=1719] I'm thankful to say and see followers of Jesus doing justice, doing mish pot.
[time=1724] Back in April, Kelly already referenced this.
[time=1728] Back in April, my wife Hannah and I, Kelly and a team of people got to go over to Nairobi, Kenya to work in new life home.
[time=1735] And we got to taste and see, and I mentioned the first hour, even smell, biblical justice.
[time=1742] You see on the screen here, a picture of a little guy named Dwight.
[time=1747] - Dwight.
[time=1748] - And somewhere around a year ago, Dwight was found in a field.
[time=1752] He was three days old, they think.
[time=1755] His umbilical cord was still attached.
[time=1757] It was obvious from the wounds on his body that his mother had tried to abort him and left him in the field to die.
[time=1764] Somehow, miraculously, he was still alive after three days.
[time=1769] But he was in very bad shape.
[time=1771] The statistic is that in the country of Kenya alone, there are 300 babies a day who are abandoned.
[time=1780] Some of them are abandoned in hospitals and some in at the police station, but others like Dwight left in fields to die.
[time=1793] Most of these little people, like you and me, have diseases, many of them are HIV positive, and here's the thing, they have no power, literally no power to do anything about it.
[time=1807] And so, in steps in organization like new life home, led by followers of Jesus, and they work to rescue as many babies as possible.
[time=1818] They feed them and clothe them, provide shelter for them and care for them, and they've actually found that in the first 12 to 18 months of life, if a baby is HIV positive, that if they have the proper nutrition and medicine and love, being held and played with and cared for, that they can actually become HIV negative.
[time=1841] Isn't that amazing?
[time=1841] In fact, 75 to 90% of the babies who come to new life home
[time=1847] who are HIV positive become HIV negative.
[time=1853] Then, many of them are fostered or adopted into loving, caring homes.
[time=1859] They are given a new life.
[time=1862] That right there is a picture of restoration, a picture of fixing that which is broken.
[time=1869] That is a picture of biblical justice.
[time=1872] Let me, if I can, just jump in here with just a couple of thoughts.
[time=1878] As I listened to Tony describe that, and I listened to him first hour, described that whole process at new life home.
[time=1886] This is all kind of raw.
[time=1888] I may say this better a few months from now, but I'm gonna try my best to say it as best I can this morning.
[time=1896] I think I grew up in churches that believed that God loved the truth.
[time=1903] And raise your hand if you think he does.
[time=1910] [AMEN] I think I grew up in churches that believed God loved the truth.
[time=1915] And it's really a both-and, but I think in some cases it became an either-or, because I grew up in my day, I kind of grew up in places where when we would hear about soup kitchens, and orphans, and poor people, somehow those things often got labeled almost as the liberal pursuits of a church off-track, because somehow that church got all involved in social stuff.
[time=1941] Now, I may not be making any sense to anybody, but I'm making a lot of sense to me as I think this through.
[time=1946] I grew up in a church that was really, really committed to the truth.
[time=1951] And so because of that, that church and its activity was all about teaching those principles, and teaching that truth, and teaching that doctrine, and the teaching of those principles, and that truth, and that doctrine is good.
[time=1967] But God loves justice.
[time=1970] It's both-and.
[time=1972] And it's not a liberal bent, and it's not some misguided social humanitarian pursuit, because my friend's the gospel.
[time=1983] The gospel is all about the transforming, radically transforming power of Christ, who came and did what he did so people's lives could be radically changed.
[time=1996] The rich people, and the poor people.
[time=1999] The black, and the brown, and the yellow, and everybody, every walk of life, every circumstance.
[time=2004] This is to be about you and I, truth, yes, and justice.
[time=2009] And I'm so thankful that with the encouragement of so many of you, we have started to in recent days take steps, not away from the truth, but steps with the truth undergirding us, and giving us a foundation, steps toward, I think, living out in this ministry, inside and outside these four walls.
[time=2029] A commitment and an effort to try and be the people.
[time=2032] God's called us to be those that, while loving truth, because of that truth, do justice.
[time=2038] Restoring and fixing that which is broken.
[time=2041] And I think it's something we've got to pay very close attention to.
[time=2044] Jesus did.
[time=2047] We've also over the years, I'm sorry.
[time=2049] Let me just say this real quick.
[time=2050] We also, over the years, got enamored with the epistles.
[time=2054] And we forgot about the Gospels.
[time=2056] And it's not either or it's both and.
[time=2059] And when you read, really read the Gospels.
[time=2063] And why wouldn't we want to just read what Jesus did,
[time=2069] and what Jesus said, and how he taught his followers?
[time=2073] When you immerse yourself in the Gospels, you realize there's this picture of Jesus, and Tony's going to tell us about that right now.
[time=2080] There's this picture of Messiah.
[time=2082] There's this picture of our Savior, my friends, who was all about the truth, but boy, oh boy, oh boy, was he about justice.
[time=2089] Fixing that which was broken.
[time=2092] Yeah, and that's right.
[time=2094] And I mentioned a while ago that the prophets spoke words of rebuke, and of a warning, and a warning of a coming judgment.
[time=2102] And they also spoke words of hope, and of a promised restoration.
[time=2106] Well, along with those two things, many of them also spoke words about this coming king.
[time=2113] They called him the Mashiach, the Messiah.
[time=2115] And throughout the prophets, including Isaiah, we see a really strong link between the prophecies of this king and Mishpat.
[time=2127] We could go to Isaiah 9.
[time=2129] We're actually going to skip over that.
[time=2130] We'll go right to Isaiah 42, verse 1, it says, "Again, this is one of many places we could go." And he says, "Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one, in whom I delight, I will put my spirit on him, and he will bring Mishpat justice to the nations.
[time=2149] He will not shout, or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets.
[time=2154] A bruised read, he will not break, and a smoldering wick, he will not snuff out.
[time=2158] In faithfulness, he will bring forth justice.
[time=2162] He will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes Mishpat on earth.
[time=2169] In his law, the islands will put their hope." So the prophecies were that this Messiah would come.
[time=2176] And part of what he would bring is this kind of justice that we're talking about this morning to the nations.
[time=2181] And so when Jesus came, when the Messiah came, toward the beginning of his ministry, in the very first part of his ministry in the region of Galilee, he went to his home village of Nazareth.
[time=2194] And on the Sabbath, he went to the synagogue, and he took the scroll and what did he read from.
[time=2199] He read from Isaiah 61, beautiful words of restoration.
[time=2205] And he rolled up the scroll, and he handed it back, and he sat down with all the eyes on him.
[time=2209] And he said, "Today, in your hearing, this scripture is fulfilled." And throughout really all of the gospels, like Kelly said, we see Jesus doing this kind of justice, fixing that which is broken.
[time=2223] One of the places we see this are in the miracles of Jesus.
[time=2228] One way to look at his miracles is that they are mishpaht in action.
[time=2234] In the gospels, there are 33 specific miracle accounts.
[time=2239] That's not including the passages where it says Jesus healed a bunch of people, and he cast out a bunch of demons.
[time=2245] 33 specific individual miracle accounts.
[time=2249] Only one of those 33 is punishment for evil.
[time=2254] It's where he curses the fig tree.
[time=2256] The rest of those miracle accounts are Jesus fixing that which is broken, and often in the very most broken places.
[time=2264] We've been, as a family, spending the whole summer, really,
[time=2270] in Matthew's gospel, and the very first part of the Sermon on the Mount, which is found in Matthew chapters 5, 6, and 7.
[time=2277] We've been in the Beatitudes right there at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2281] Well, in the next two chapters, Matthew chapters 8 and 9, Matthew strings together this beautiful picture of 10 miracles of Jesus.
[time=2290] And Kelly and I are going to go back and forth here in a minute.
[time=2293] We're not going to read through all of Matthew 8 and 9.
[time=2295] We're just going to highlight those miracles.
[time=2297] And I want to ask you to do two things as we go back and forth.
[time=2301] First of all, think about this understanding of justice and see Jesus fixing that which is broken.
[time=2308] And then second, and most importantly, perhaps this morning, take this opportunity to worship our Lord Jesus.
[time=2317] Think about the fact that he actually did these things.
[time=2321] And if it helps you to shut your eyes and just take this in and imagine it happening, do that, do whatever it takes.
[time=2326] Let's worship him together this morning as we go back and forth with these 10 miracles in Matthew chapters 8 and 9.
[time=2333] So the first one, Jesus comes down from a mountain and a leper comes to him and throws himself at his feet.
[time=2341] And a leper in that day, as many of you know, a person who has a skin disease who is unclean.
[time=2346] And because of that, not allowed to touch anybody, not allowed to enter into most towns or villages or cities.
[time=2352] And when people walk by them, they have to yell unclean, unclean.
[time=2358] And Jesus touches this leper and he was made completely clean.
[time=2363] He was completely healed and he was completely restored.
[time=2367] It says in Matthew 8, verse 5, 6 and 7, it talks about a Roman centurion who came to Jesus.
[time=2379] And you got to stop right there and just think about that for a moment.
[time=2382] Roman centurians didn't come to Jesus.
[time=2385] But this guy, the scripture says, in essence had faith.
[time=2387] And this Roman centurion comes and he has a servant, one of his household who's paralyzed.
[time=2394] The text actually says, "Fearfully paralyzed at home and fearfully tormented
[time=2400] is the servant." And so this Roman centurion comes and says to Jesus, "In essence, I know you can heal him.
[time=2407] I believe you can heal him." And Jesus says, "I'll come to your house." And the guy says, "No, no, no, no, don't come to my house.
[time=2414] Don't do that. That would not go well.
[time=2416] I believe you can heal him just by your very word." And there's a long discourse there, but the gist of it is Jesus says, "Wow, the faith of this man is amazing." And Jesus speaks that word of justice, that word of healing.
[time=2430] He fixes that which was broken, that servant.
[time=2433] It says in that very moment Jesus spoke, his paralysis was lifted.
[time=2437] And then Jesus goes into a home and there's a woman who is sick with a fever and lying
[time=2443] in bed. In fact, it's Peter's mother-in-law.
[time=2446] Jesus walks over to her, touches her by the hand, and she is made completely well.
[time=2451] She's completely restored and she gets up and begins to serve those in the house.
[time=2456] He stops a potentially dead storm.
[time=2460] If you read on in chapter 8 of Matthew, you come to verse 25 and there we see him and the disciples getting into the boat.
[time=2466] They start making their way across the sea.
[time=2467] Jesus falls asleep.
[time=2469] They're awake.
[time=2470] Storm comes.
[time=2470] It's going to be deadly.
[time=2471] It's going to be horrible.
[time=2472] It's going to be absolutely awful.
[time=2474] And they scream and cry and wake him up.
[time=2476] And with a word he does mishpah.
[time=2479] With a word he stops that which was deadly and out of control and potentially dangerous.
[time=2484] Comes the storm and stills the sea waters in an amazing, an amazing example of his power
[time=2493] and his ability to bring calm and peace where it was about to get ugly.
[time=2500] So when they get to the other side of the sea, Jesus and his followers, the welcoming committee that's there for them is to violently demon possess men.
[time=2509] So under the power of these demons that the people of that region couldn't pass through that area.
[time=2515] And so Jesus with the word cast out the demons and these men were restored completely
[time=2523] to their right minds.
[time=2524] Following that in chapter 9, getting into a boat Jesus crossed over the sea
[time=2530] and came to his own city.
[time=2531] He goes back now and when he gets back they bring him a paralytic lying on a bed.
[time=2536] Seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take courage son your sins are forgiven."
[time=2542] And he heals this paralytic.
[time=2545] This young man whose body didn't work.
[time=2548] This young man whose body was broken.
[time=2550] Jesus heals him.
[time=2553] Jesus brings wholeness to that which was shattered.
[time=2558] And this next one I think is probably my favorite.
[time=2561] It's a woman, many of you've heard this story, the woman who had been bleeding for 12 years, 12 years of pain and suffering and discomfort, 12 years of being an outcast because of the uncleanliness that resulted from her 12 years of bleeding.
[time=2575] And she basically crawls up to Jesus and touches the edge of his cloak.
[time=2583] The edge of his cloak and she was made completely well. She was completely restored.
[time=2589] You think it was amazing that a Roman centurion came later on in 9, Matthew 9,
[time=2595] unofficial one of the rulers from the synagogue comes.
[time=2600] Now these are the guys that didn't think too highly of our lord but this guy's little girl.
[time=2604] Later we learn his name to be Jarius and his little girl somewhere probably under the age of 12.
[time=2611] If you're a little girl in the room, under the age of 12, raise your hand.
[time=2615] Real high, way up in the air.
[time=2616] If you're a little girl in the room, under the age of 12, raise your hand.
[time=2619] Give us a visual.
[time=2620] All right, any girls under the age of 12?
[time=2622] I see you back there.
[time=2622] Good, good, good.
[time=2623] All right, think about it.
[time=2624] There you go, thank you.
[time=2625] Little girls under the age of 12.
[time=2628] Jarius, the synagogue official, his little girl was dying and had actually passed.
[time=2634] And he comes and asks the lord if the lord would come because he's so worried and
[time=2640] stirred in his heart over the condition of his daughter and Jesus comes.
[time=2643] And Jesus walks into the room and says that she's asleep and they laugh.
[time=2649] And he says, you know, in essence it's no laughing matter.
[time=2653] He walks over and he touches her handy, speaks to her and she wakes up.
[time=2658] She was dead and now she's alive.
[time=2661] And Jesus in that moment exercises Mishpa.
[time=2664] He brings life and he brings wholeness to that which was broken.
[time=2670] And then two blind men cried out to him.
[time=2672] They said, son of David, have mercy on us.
[time=2675] And Jesus went to them and with a word and just by touching their eyes, their sight was completely restored.
[time=2682] They could see again.
[time=2683] And then speech is restored.
[time=2687] There's a mute demonized man, a demon possessed guy who's obviously struggling.
[time=2694] As they were going out, a mute demon possessed man was brought to him.
[time=2697] After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke and the crowds were amazed.
[time=2701] Jesus takes this guy and brings wholeness, brings healing, brings peace to a heart
[time=2708] and soul and life that had obviously been disrupted a great deal.
[time=2712] He brings healing to that which was broken.
[time=2715] So when Jesus came, when Jesus the Messiah came, he did Mishpa.
[time=2723] The reality is that we probably don't need to be reminded this morning that our world is broken.
[time=2730] We know that.
[time=2731] We see it all around us.
[time=2733] But we probably, I know I need to be reminded this morning of those things that the prophets did, the rebuke and the hope.
[time=2740] I think maybe we and I certainly know I need to, in a certain way, be rebuked this morning
[time=2747] because I need to do just this kind of justice. Micah 6-8, one of these prophets that was
[time=2753] prophesying at the same time as Isaiah said, "What does the Lord require of you, O man?
[time=2759] Do Mishpa. Do biblical justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God."
[time=2769] So my question, one of my questions here is where do you see brokenness and need
[time=2775] around you? Maybe it's in your family, your neighborhood, here in the city of Fort Wayne, around the world. Where do you see it?
[time=2782] And are you trying to take steps to fix that which is broken?
[time=2787] One of my dreams for us as a family is that this would become biblical justice,
[time=2793] will be part of the heartbeat of who we are.
[time=2796] Yes, holding on to truth, raising that up, but also this kind of justice.
[time=2801] We're not talking about the social gospel here, but when you read God's word, the gospel is social. It has these implications.
[time=2811] Secondly, words of hope. Be reminded this morning that God will restore all things.
[time=2819] Revelation 21 says that he is making all things new and he loves it. What does God love?
[time=2829] God loves justice.
[time=2831] Well, we need to think about this by friends. You and I need to give thought. Our mission
[time=2843] is to do justice. Our hope is that a day will come when justice will completely be
[time=2849] experienced. Restoration will be final. Until then, God invites you and God invites me to
[time=2856] participate with him in this endeavor. And I want to just this morning give you an opportunity to respond. I want to ask Corbin and the band if they come up. And I want you all to just that we've got a few minutes left here. So stay with us, please. I want you to give some
[time=2870] thought to the opportunities that maybe God has put right in front of you. Tony mentioned going across the world. He talked about our trip to Nairobi. I can't wait to go back. I want to go
[time=2880] to some of these places where there's opportunities for you and I to meet new people and be in new cultures and new places and give ourselves to this kind of ministry, this ministry of justice and
[time=2892] restoration. It's a good thing and many of us should go and be exposed to that and be encouraged
[time=2898] as we do so. But I'll tell you what, there's maybe a fence about three blocks down the street
[time=2905] from where you live that you've been driving past every day for the last six months and it's broken.
[time=2912] It needs painting. There may be a widow lady down the street. There may be somebody in your office
[time=2918] that you work with. There may be opportunities right in front of you and me where things are
[time=2925] broken. And my friends from a fence that might need to be painted to a friend who's struggling
[time=2933] with addiction who might need you to come alongside in a powerful way and encourage him or her.
[time=2940] There are these opportunities and Tony and I talked about getting really specific with you this morning. But we kind of just felt led to say, you know, what we're going to trust that you'll consider and you'll give thought and you'll give prayer and you'll do it individually or even as a family to how you can be those who would carry out justice. Those that would seek to
[time=2959] restore that which is broken. And as Corbin plays, let me just also invite you to think about this.
[time=2965] There may be some in the room this morning and you may know him. You may have met the great healer.
[time=2973] There may be a time in your life where you surrendered your heart and soul to him and he he fixed that which was broken and you're so thankful that he did that. But today,
[time=2984] today something may have occurred. Something may have happened or transpired in recent days or
[time=2991] weeks or months or years. And the truth is your heart today, your soul isn't right.
[time=2999] It feels scattered. It feels broken. It feels heavy. And you maybe today could just use the
[time=3008] encouragement of an elder or pastor or friend, one of us, to just pray with you and just connect
[time=3014] you again to the one who wants to fix it, wants to heal it, wants to not just patch it up but make
[time=3021] it new. And so this morning, as Corbin sings, we're going to invite you to come down and we would love nothing more than to pray with you to encourage you. Those of you that know him, but your heart is heavy. Your life is scattered. Something's gone south and you really could use some help and some encouragement. Others of you in the room, you know what? Truth be told, you've never ever bowed the knee of your heart to him. You don't know him personally. You've never surrendered your heart and life to him and maybe today would be the day you just want to come and we could pray with you and talk with you. And for the first time ever, your heart could be healed.
[time=3054] Your broken soul could be mended and he could give you today this new life. It's what it says in
[time=3063] Revelation. He's making things new and I believe he's doing it right here this morning in this room.
[time=3071] There are others of you in the room and you need to be rebuked. Tony and I need to be rebuked from time to time on this issue. There are some in the room and you need to be admonished because you've been driving past that fence for months. You've known of that lady who needs help and you've done not a thing. There's a family down the street and you know if you put your heads together, you as a family could do something to help make something that's not right at least a little bit more toward whole and healthy. And so we've got to be careful and maybe you as an
[time=3101] individual or a family need to come down and just make that commitment. Maybe you just need to come down and say you know what, I'm going to do something. I know what it is. I know who she is.
[time=3109] I know who he is and would you pray for me to have courage to do it. So if you need some encouragement you know him but your heart's heavy let him restore that heart. If you don't know him and you'd like
[time=3120] to meet him today, let us introduce you to him. Or if you just need some accountability to go
[time=3128] and do justice this week. Come on down and we'll pray with you. Thank you for being here. Would you
[time=3134] stand? Would you not leave? Would you stay? And as Corbin sings, "Come down and let our elders, let our staff, let Tony and I pray with you and encourage you along these lines."
