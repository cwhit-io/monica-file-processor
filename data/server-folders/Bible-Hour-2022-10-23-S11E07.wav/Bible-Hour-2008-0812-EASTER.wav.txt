[time=116] One of the amazing first 20 minutes or so, Jamie Choir, thank you.
[time=122] Hey, one of my great memories.
[time=125] I have a few hard memories of seminary.
[time=129] Most of you know, seminary is where you go, doctors go to med school, and lawyers go to law school.
[time=135] Sometimes if you want to do this for a living, and I think especially if you want to try to do your best to teach and explain this with as much accuracy as possible, a lot of folks go to grad school, and in the ministry profession it's called seminary, and in seminary, boy, it's a tough road.
[time=153] A lot of work, a lot of reading, a lot of tests.
[time=156] Boy, you get stretched personally and academically, and it's just quite a three years.
[time=161] Anyway, a lot of hard memories.
[time=163] One of the great memories for me in seminary was in one of my classes over a period of time they dedicated.
[time=171] We dedicated in our course of study.
[time=174] We dedicated a specific segment of time to a study of the resurrection.
[time=179] And what an amazing thing for me, as a young guy going into ministry, as a guy at that time who had been a believer for about four, five years,
[time=189] for me to take that time with those men and that professor and to study, to study God's Word, to study all the arguments, all the theories, all the ideas that are out there, all the things that people say probably did happen instead of what this book tells us happened and to look at those carefully, to be diligent in our study and our look at those things.
[time=214] In fact, I think it was four, maybe five years ago on a resurrection Sunday morning here, we preached a message that just kind of threw out there, all the options that over the years people have tried to support as an answer or an alternative to what God's Word says happened on that morning.
[time=230] That message four or five years ago here on a Sunday morning kind of just flowed out of the study and the experience that I had in that class over those several weeks, it was unbelievably gratifying and it was incredibly fortifying in my own heart in life as a Christ follower.
[time=249] And to be able to stand here today and to tell you that through the teaching of God's Word and what it really literally says to place through books like evidence that demands a verdict by Josh McDowell, a case for Christ and a case for faith by Lee Strobel, you can today do your own scholarly look into this issue of the resurrection
[time=271] and you can, as God's Word leads you and me in that study, come to the very same conclusion that I came to in that class some 22 years ago, which is it happened.
[time=283] It happened like God's Word says it happened.
[time=286] And there isn't any other theory, there isn't any other idea, there isn't any other thing floating out there that makes any sense, physically, politically, medically, nothing.
[time=298] It happened.
[time=300] It's as much a part of history.
[time=303] It is as literal and factual as the signing of the declaration of independence
[time=309] as the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
[time=312] George Washington was the first president and Jesus historically and literally and actually defeated death.
[time=320] And that tomb was empty on this morning, some 2000 years ago.
[time=325] And so I'll never forget that professor, you know, there in class, and I heard him say it then and I heard him say it for years and years since, that the truth about the resurrection demands, it invites, it begs a response.
[time=340] You know, I think if there's going to be a question asked when you and I go before God, I think if there's going to be a question asked at that moment, I think the question that gets asked isn't, did you go to church?
[time=356] I don't think the question that really gets asked is how good of a person were you.
[time=360] I don't think the question that gets asked is how much money did you give.
[time=364] I think the question, really, my friends, the question of all questions is what did you do?
[time=372] How did you respond to a risen Lord?
[time=377] What are you going to do with Jesus?
[time=380] And this morning we want to give you a chance to just look with us into the scripture, your response to the resurrection.
[time=387] There aren't many, I want to show you three responses to the resurrection.
[time=392] And I think in this room this morning, probably with all of you that are here, I would guess that every one of these three probably is symbolic.
[time=400] But every one of these three is present in this room this morning.
[time=406] And I want to just start out here with response number one.
[time=409] And as we make our way through response number one, response number two, and response number three, I would invite you this morning.
[time=416] I would beg you this morning to, in these moments, honestly and sincerely before God, do your very best with great authenticity and transparency to say this is my response.
[time=430] This is where I am today as it relates to the resurrection, and we want to give you a chance here today to think that through, and maybe take some steps forward in your spiritual journey with him.
[time=440] Response number one, for many of us in the room, it is victorious joy and elation.
[time=447] For many of us in the room who know him, for those of you in the room this morning who have at some point in time, you have come to grips with that picture we drew a couple weeks ago, that bridge picture that we drew.
[time=459] You at some point in time came to the point where you realized your sin separated you from God.
[time=465] You came to this place where you fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=469] The spirit of God was drawing you to God the Father.
[time=473] You responded by bowing the knee of your heart and giving yourself completely to him.
[time=479] That may have been a few months ago, that may have been a few years ago, that may have been 30 years ago, but there are those of you in the room this morning, and your heart this morning is filled with joy.
[time=489] It's been welling up for six weeks, and you come into this place today, absolutely ready to express to him your victorious joy and elation.
[time=499] That is your response to the resurrection.
[time=503] We see it in a number of different places.
[time=505] We see it played out in a number of different passages.
[time=508] Look with me at Matthew 28, if you would.
[time=511] Matthew, chapter 28, in the first gospel at the end of that gospel,
[time=519] having taken us through the account of his trial and his persecution and his crucifixion, now we come to Matthew 28 verses 1 to 8, and it says, "Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,
[time=535] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.
[time=540] And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and set upon it, and his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
[time=555] The guards, verse 4, shook for fear of him and became like dead men.
[time=560] The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified.
[time=568] He's not here.
[time=571] Everybody in the room, read these next four words with me out loud.
[time=576] For he has risen." Just as he said, "Come see the place where he was laying." Verse 7, the angel says, "Go quickly now, and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead.
[time=590] And behold, he is going ahead of you into Galilee.
[time=593] There you will see him.
[time=594] Behold, I have told you." And then there it is in verse 8.
[time=597] And they left, Mary and Mary, having encountered this angel, having seen what they encountered there at the tomb with these soldiers laying on the ground and the stone rolled away, and this message having been delivered by the angels.
[time=611] And they left the tomb, it says, "Quickly with fear and great joy."
[time=617] And ran to report it to his disciples with fear and great joy.
[time=623] Why fear?
[time=624] Well, the fear is pretty easy to understand.
[time=626] I mean, the fear for these two gals who had been through what they had been through, were feeling compelled and obligated to go to the tomb that morning with their spices, having no idea what they would encounter.
[time=637] All of a sudden there's an angel.
[time=639] All of a sudden the stones rolled away.
[time=641] All of a sudden there's the soldiers.
[time=643] Again, most of the time in our pictures that we got painted for us as little kids in Sunday school, nothing wrong with those pictures.
[time=649] But most of the time you see a picture of a guard.
[time=652] You know, most of the times there's that Roman dude with the spear and the helmet deal with the feathers or whatever those things are.
[time=659] And he's standing there by the tomb.
[time=661] Well, in actuality, as you study this, scholars will tell you that more than likely what had been deployed to the tomb that day was a group of 20 to 50 soldiers.
[time=672] So what they had encountered was this scattering of bodies.
[time=676] It says they were laying there as dead.
[time=679] These gals are freaked out.
[time=682] Are they scared? Sure, they're scared.
[time=684] But they're not just scared.
[time=685] They're filled with, along with the fear.
[time=687] It says great joy.
[time=689] When you study that phrase, you find that it means exceeding happiness.
[time=693] You find that it means outward exuberance, a maintainable excitement, and a mixture of deep relief.
[time=702] Deep relief. You understand that, right?
[time=705] You understand that these gals and those that followed him had walked out so very far on that limb.
[time=710] You understand that in their following of him, they had in so many ways excluded themselves from a society that hated him.
[time=718] You realize that by their testimony and by their faithfulness and by their obedience to him, they had been labeled.
[time=725] They had been marked.
[time=727] And so here he was gone.
[time=729] Now all of a sudden, the tomb's empty.
[time=731] Here's an angel.
[time=733] Maybe they didn't at that point figure it all out, but it says they're filled with great joy, exceeding happiness, outward exuberance, a sense of deep relief mixed with expectant anticipation.
[time=746] Imagine, if you came this morning, imagine what it must have been like for those two women as they experienced this amazing scene on that amazing morning there at the tomb.
[time=760] This is so hard.
[time=768] I don't want to see him like this.
[time=770] I don't want to do this.
[time=771] We have to do this.
[time=773] After all he did for us, we have to do this.
[time=776] We have to be strong.
[time=778] Mary, how will we ever move that stone?
[time=781] We've got to find someone to help us.
[time=783] Well, maybe we can find Peter and John, but that will never be enough.
[time=790] It would take so many men just to move that stone.
[time=795] What?
[time=798] What happened?
[time=802] They've taken him away.
[time=805] What happened here?
[time=807] I don't know.
[time=808] I'm going to find out.
[time=810] Hey, it's all right.
[time=812] Don't run away.
[time=814] I know what you're looking for.
[time=816] Jesus, who was crucified.
[time=818] Don't worry, he's not here.
[time=820] He has risen just like he said he would.
[time=823] Now go ahead.
[time=824] We'll take a look.
[time=826] I know.
[time=828] Careful.
[time=830] He's gone.
[time=835] Now go.
[time=837] Tell the disciples they need to get to Galilee.
[time=839] Jesus will meet them there.
[time=842] He did it.
[time=844] Oh, he really did it.
[time=845] We have to tell everyone.
[time=847] We have to run.
[time=848] And tell Peter and John.
[time=850] Mary, you're going to be so excited.
[time=852] Mary, wait.
[time=854] Where is he?
[time=859] He is alive.
[time=863] He really did it.
[time=865] He's alive.
[time=866] You're right, like he told us.
[time=868] He is alive.
[time=870] Go on, let's go, go on.
[time=872] Mary, we have to tell them.
[time=874] Come on, come on.
[time=878] Amen?
[time=879] Isn't that great?
[time=880] Yeah, you can clap.
[time=881] (applause)
[time=887] I told them I could have just explained all that.
[time=889] But they thought maybe it'd be a good idea to just show you, which I agree with.
[time=894] I think there's nothing like just being able to see it.
[time=897] You know, if that's exactly how it went.
[time=899] But I hope you sensed in them.
[time=901] I know it was there in those two gals.
[time=903] This victorious joy and elation.
[time=907] Well, you know what?
[time=908] They weren't the only ones.
[time=909] Let's look at Peter and John.
[time=911] Fascinating.
[time=913] Again, compelling passage.
[time=915] Go to John, if you would.
[time=916] Go to the Gospel of John, chapter 20.
[time=918] It says in John, chapter 20, verse 8.
[time=922] Excuse me, in John, chapter 20, verse 1.
[time=925] It says, "Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was still dark and saw the stone already taken away from the tomb.
[time=933] And so she ran, it says there in verse 2, and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved.
[time=940] You and I know that to be John, the author of this very Gospel.
[time=945] She ran to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb.
[time=952] And we do not know where they have laid him." So Peter and the other disciple went forth.
[time=958] Watch this now, it's interesting.
[time=960] So Peter and the other disciple went forth and they were going to the tomb.
[time=964] He could have left it at that, but no, watch what he does.
[time=967] And there's a reason he does what he does here.
[time=969] The two were running together.
[time=971] See, he doesn't just say they went forth to the tomb.
[time=973] He says the two were running.
[time=975] And what you need to understand was that in that culture, they didn't run a lot.
[time=980] They weren't a running people.
[time=982] A lot of it had to do with their dress.
[time=984] A lot of it had to do with how they would have the robes and the tunics and all of that.
[time=989] It took a lot to get them to run.
[time=993] And he wants you to see that not only did they go forth to the tomb, he wants you to understand they ran.
[time=1000] And there was a reason that they ran and the reason that they ran is they were filled with victorious joy and elation.
[time=1007] But look at this, I love this too about John.
[time=1009] We don't talk about this much, but it says the two were running together.
[time=1012] And the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first.
[time=1018] I just like that about John.
[time=1020] He just wants you to know that he's faster than Peter.
[time=1024] It wasn't really needed.
[time=1025] The text didn't call for it.
[time=1026] He just wants you to know that Peter's slow and old and he's young and fast.
[time=1034] Stooping in and looking in, he saw the John.
[time=1037] He saw the linen wrappings laying there, but he did not go in, just like John, John the cautious one.
[time=1044] And so Simon Peter, the get out of my way, one, also came following him and entered the tomb.
[time=1051] And he saw, Peter saw the linen wrappings laying there and the face cloth, which had been on his head, Christ's head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself.
[time=1064] So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered and he saw and believed.
[time=1073] And the disciples down in verse 10, it says the disciples went away again to their own homes, but I want you to see in Luke 2412.
[time=1080] In Luke 2412, what it says is that they left marvelling, but Peter got up and ran to the tomb, stooping and looking in, he saw the linen wrappings only and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened.
[time=1093] Marvelling, running again, marveling, marveling, the word meaning, an emotional, an astounded amazement.
[time=1102] They were amazed at what they saw. They were astonished by what they saw.
[time=1108] It's welling up in them, marveling in the vernacular of our day.
[time=1113] It would be as if you and I were running home going no way.
[time=1117] No way. I can't believe this. I mean, I can't believe it, but I can't.
[time=1121] There's no way you've just got to be kidding me.
[time=1125] Unbelievable. And you think about those two, you think about what was on the line for them, you think about what they had been experiencing over the last 48 hours or so. John was the one whom Jesus loved.
[time=1137] Many of you know the story between John and Jesus. There was a special relationship between the two. Christ had impacted his heart and life like none other. Peter, my goodness Peter, Peter had in those two, three days prior to, oh my, what an opportunity Peter had to stand and represent. What a chance Peter had been given to confess his love and his devotion and his faithfulness to Christ. He had the opportunity to stand as high as he's ever stood, but instead he falls.
[time=1169] He falls to the deepest, lowest level of failure and abandonment and rejection and discouragement as he cowers in the face of those who asked him that night if he knew the Lord. So here's Peter living with all of that.
[time=1185] Here they are missing their friend.
[time=1189] For Peter and John, the experience, the experience that morning might have looked something like this.
[time=1197] Hey, where do you think we're going?
[time=1201] Peter, John, he's gone!
[time=1205] He's gone! We went to the tomb to prepare the body and we didn't know how we were going to roll that stone away, but it was already open.
[time=1213] Yes, and the soldiers were lying all over the ground, and there was this man, this huge man was inside of the tomb. I heard his voice inside of me saying we have to go to Galilee. We dropped all of his things.
[time=1225] We came right here. He's gone! Go on, who took him?
[time=1229] Jesus! Jesus! He's gone!
[time=1235] He's gone! He did it.
[time=1241] He did it. Just like he said he would. Let's go.
[time=1245] Check this out for ourselves. He said something about this during the Seder. Remember the other night?
[time=1249] He said John, he's going to go ahead of us in Galilee. John, John, wait!
[time=1253] I was there. He died.
[time=1257] If he can raise Lazarus from the dead, can't he raise himself?
[time=1261] Go!
[time=1265] He's gone! He is gone!
[time=1275] He's gone!
[time=1283] He said that in three days he would rise.
[time=1287] That means he's alive!
[time=1291] He's risen! I've got to tell the others. We must go to Galilee.
[time=1295] Matthew! I get to tell Andrew. Andrew, Thomas is not going to hate Peter Waite.
[time=1299] Oh God!
[time=1303] He's alive!
[time=1315] Like I said, I told him I could have just explained that to you.
[time=1319] But we thought maybe it might just be helpful to see it, to experience it, to be reminded of what it might have been like. And you know what? I just want to say this.
[time=1327] I know there's many of you in the room who know him.
[time=1331] Many of you who have placed your faith in Arisen, Lord, I would hope for you this morning. I would hope for you right now. I would hope for you each and every day, really. That level of elation, you and I should be that thankful. Amen? That's the reality that we live with. He is alive. He did it.
[time=1355] Death has no sting. The tomb was empty.
[time=1359] And as they realized it that morning, you and I have the joy and the privilege of realizing it again this morning. Victorious joy and elation. You know what? There's one more scene I want to show you though.
[time=1371] Before we move away from the victorious joy and elation.
[time=1375] And as I read it to you, maybe what you could do is just take a moment. I don't know that you'll get a quiet moment again today. Maybe just take a moment and just close your eyes. Can you do that?
[time=1383] Maybe just close your eyes. Let me read to you what it says in verse 11.
[time=1387] Verse 11 through 17 of John 20 because as Peter and John went off home marveling and running, it says in verse 11, "But Mary was standing outside the tomb." Mary standing outside the tomb, she stays behind and she's weeping.
[time=1403] And so as she wept, she stooped and it says looked into the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting. One at the head and one at the feet.
[time=1415] Where the body of Jesus had been lying and they verse 13 said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him." You can just maybe in your mind's eye you can just see her. She just wants desperately to know what has happened. She realizes that he's not there. She realizes the body's gone, right? But she wants to understand where he is. When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there and did not know that it was Jesus.
[time=1451] And Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?
[time=1455] Who are you seeking?" Supposing him to be many of you know this, supposing him to be the gardener. She says to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away." And all I love this, Jesus said to her, "Mary.
[time=1475] Mary." He says her name.
[time=1479] And she had heard him say her name so many times. And he says, "Mary." And she turned and said to him in Hebrew and the text here in the passage it says, "Robonai." R-A-B-B-O-N-I exclamation point in quotes. She says "Robonai," which means teacher. Jesus said to her, "Stop clinging to me, for I have not yet ascended to the father.
[time=1507] But go to my brethren and say to them, "I ascend to my father and your father and my God and your God." And here with your eyes closed, as you just think about that scene, I just want you to understand that she didn't say "Robonai." She didn't say "Robonai." She says in the original language here, the use of the exclamation.
[time=1531] I probably shouldn't do it here in the room. I don't want to hurt the mic.
[time=1535] But it's "Robonai." It's like from way down deep "Robonai." And the depth of emotion and the welling up of her excitement and her joy. The elation that comes out of this phrase, as she realizes it's him because he says her name. This "Robonai," if you're trying to picture what it looked like physically, well then just look at what he says in the next line. He says, "In a very appropriate way, I can only imagine as I see it, get off me." Don't hold on. Get off me. Let go.
[time=1571] Okay, back up. I'm here and I'm going to be here for a bit. I haven't ascended yet. Can you see that? That deep elation, that victorious joy, that shout, it's you, the hug, the grasp, the clinging to, like a loved one you haven't seen in years.
[time=1591] We thought about depicting that scene for you as well, but you know what? There's no depicting that.
[time=1599] The level of emotion that's there in that word, "Robonai" exclamation point is enough. And we want to give you the opportunity this morning, those of you in the room that know him, to just in these next few moments, express your victorious joy and your deep elation.
[time=1615] Let's stand and worship him together.
[time=1619] We're going to sing the song "Christ the Lord" is risen today.
[time=1623] So we're going to start by teaching you an easy chorus. It goes like this.

[time=2140] and her sister and Lazarus. Do you remember the story of Lazarus being raised from the dead?
[time=2146] Lazarus was a good friend of our Lord's. Our Lord loved Lazarus and he loved Mary and he had gotten
[time=2153] word that he was sick. It says, so when he heard that Lazarus was sick, Jesus, he then stayed two
[time=2160] days longer. It was confusing for them. He loved him so much, but he doesn't go right when he hears
[time=2166] he's sick, stayed two days longer in the place where he was. Then after this, two days, he says
[time=2173] to his disciples, Thomas being one of them, let's go to Judea again. And we won't read through the whole passage, but here's how it unfolds. The disciples freak out. They go, no, no, no, no.
[time=2183] You can't go back there. See, politically, in that day now Jesus' ministry had come to a point
[time=2189] where if he went back there, they disciples feared for his Jesus' life. They said, you can't go back
[time=2196] there. Look at our boy here. Look at verse 16. After all of that, back and forth, Thomas,
[time=2207] who was called did him, that's our guy, said to his fellow disciples, let us also go so that we may
[time=2215] what? Say it, die with him. Thomas has got some, he's got some guts, he's got some strength to him.
[time=2226] And it's Thomas who says, hey, settle down. We're going to go with him if he says that's where he's
[time=2232] going to go because we're followers of him. And if we die, we die and they went there and many of
[time=2238] you know the story as Jesus comes and rolls away the stone and calls out from the tomb. Sound familiar?
[time=2247] Calls out from the tomb Lazarus and they all watch Jesus raise Lazarus from the what? Say it.
[time=2255] So why is he doubting? Is he doubting? You think it's this basic bottom line? I just don't think
[time=2265] it can be done. I don't. Do you think this was outside the realm of the probable in Thomas' heart
[time=2277] and mind? I really don't. I don't think Thomas doubted. I think he was, and I don't, this might not be
[time=2284] the right phrase, it's the best I could come up with bear with me here. I think he was fearfully hesitant, fearfully hesitant. I think though it sounds like doubting,
[time=2295] I ought to put my hand in his side before I believe. I think though it sounds like doubting when you
[time=2302] take all of what Thomas had experienced and all of what Thomas knew, I think he's scared.
[time=2310] I think he's scared. I think sometimes we mask our fear with caution or doubt.
[time=2318] Think about it. He had seen so much, my friends. He had heard so much, but he knew, he knew that this,
[time=2325] the resurrection, he knew this was the ballgame. He understood that clearly. Thomas knew that if
[time=2331] it was true, if Jesus had defeated death, then everything Jesus had said was true. Everything Jesus
[time=2338] had taught was true. Thomas knew that if that tomb was really empty and he was really alive, everything Jesus had taught about the kingdom, everything Jesus had said about following him,
[time=2348] everything that Jesus said would happen in the days to come. Thomas knew it had to be true.
[time=2354] And on top of that, Thomas knew that if he was really alive, the implications for the world was
[time=2361] absolutely enormous. Thomas knew more than that though, that if Jesus really had come back to life, that the implications for him, for him, because now we're talking about Thomas,
[time=2372] I think he knew that if it was true, if he had really risen from the dead, the implications for him were staggering. That if he was alive, then everything now was different and that the commitment
[time=2388] that would now be called forth from him would be absolutely life sacrificing. I think Thomas
[time=2395] knew that if Jesus had come back to life, that he would have to give his, I think it was 26. After eight days his disciples were again inside,
[time=2408] they were spending a lot of time inside those days. You get that feeling? And Thomas was with
[time=2415] them this time and Jesus came, the doors having been shut and stood in their midst and said again, "Peace be with you." Then he turns and just dials right in on Thomas and he says to Thomas,
[time=2426] "Reach here, watch this." And the picture, I think we've had a picture up there for a while this morning. It's a classic traditional picture that we oftentimes see of Thomas and his hands,
[time=2436] you know, and him touching and I understand that. But it was interesting, look at this, reach here with your, Jesus says, "Reach here with your finger and see my hands and reach here your
[time=2448] hand and put it into my side." And I love this. "And do not be unbelieving but believing."
[time=2456] And does verse 28 start out by saying, "So Thomas reached his hand into his side." Does it say that?
[time=2464] Does the text say, "I know Jesus said do it." So I suppose we could just assume that if Jesus
[time=2471] said do it in that state, you know, okay, so maybe he did it. I understand that. I just think it's interesting. It doesn't say he did it because I don't think that's what this is about.
[time=2483] It doesn't say he, it doesn't say he put his hands into his side. It just says that there's Jesus,
[time=2491] Jesus speaks, Jesus says, "Okay, Thomas, go ahead." And Thomas answers and said to him,
[time=2497] "My Lord and my God," which is an amazing statement. It is a theologically packed,
[time=2504] powerful statement. "My Lord and my God is his response."
[time=2511] I think it's interesting. He doesn't say, "Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay." So, okay, touch, touch, hand, and okay, so you did survive the cross. He doesn't say that.
[time=2521] It's not his posture. It's not at all what we, what we sense or see there. You know what his response is? His response is, "Oh Lord," that phrase there, that phrase, "My Lord and my God,"
[time=2533] it's as if Thomas says, "Oh Lord, you are God," and I worship and surrender to you here in this moment.
[time=2542] It is a declaration and recognition of the deity of Christ, and it is Thomas in a statement
[time=2549] declaring that he is king and that Christ is king and that he, Thomas, will now serve and follow.
[time=2556] Anybody here in the room this morning hesitating?
[time=2561] Anybody here in the room this morning? And like Thomas, my opinion here, I think Thomas deep down
[time=2571] inside, well, forget Thomas for a moment, God's word says in Romans 1 that every one of us knows deep down inside that it's all really true. We were all created. Romans teaches us in the image
[time=2585] of God. Scripture teaches that every one of us knows deep down inside that it's all true, that he really is the king, that he's worthy of our praise and our following. He's worthy of our lives.
[time=2598] And I think Thomas knew it. And I don't think Thomas just flat out said, "I don't think it could
[time=2606] be done." I think Thomas hesitates because he realizes what's true. If in fact, he has risen.
[time=2613] Anybody here in that boat? Fearful because you know like Thomas that following Christ will be
[time=2620] costly, that honoring God fully, not coming here a few times a year, not trying to be a good person.
[time=2629] I'm not talking about reading a few books. I'm not talking about attending a Bible study now and that I'm talking about what Jesus calls you and I to, which is fully and absolutely and completely
[time=2641] following, surrendering ourselves, devoting ourselves with his help and the strength that
[time=2647] he provides to a life in relationship with him. It'll affect everything about you. The way you
[time=2654] think, the way you choose, the values you have, the places you go, the stuff you give yourself to, the stuff you don't. And I wonder if there are any this morning and your response to the
[time=2665] resurrection is, "Oh my goodness." I know, I know down deep inside it's probably true, but wow.
[time=2672] If I say yes to this, he's going to want all of me. There's another response I want to show you.
[time=2680] Kind of takes us to similar places. You've got victorious joy and elation. You've got the doubting
[time=2689] or the, actually let me read that. Let me read the end of that passage. It's amazing. I love this.
[time=2693] Thomas answered, said to him, "My Lord and my God, Jesus said to him, because you have seen me, right? Because you have seen me. Doesn't say because you touched me. Doesn't say because you put your hand inside me. Because you have seen me. Have you believed blessed are they who did not see
[time=2710] and yet believed?" Guess who that is? That's you. If you're here today, the Lord said, "You're blessed
[time=2722] because you've believed. You've surrendered your heart and life to him. And did you get to see him
[time=2728] in a room? Did you get to see the nail pierced hands? Did you get to see the hole in his side?" No, no, but you because of the truth that has been exposed because of the spirit of God that drew
[time=2741] you toward him, because of your understanding of what was true and your willingness to bow the knee of you. Are you believed not having even seen? And the Lord calls you blessed. Response number
[time=2752] three, conviction. What an incredible picture this is. Who are we talking about? The Roman soldier,
[time=2759] oftentimes referred to as the centurion. Go to Luke. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. Go to Luke 23,
[time=2766] if you would. Luke 23, the Roman centurion, Luke 23, 44. Luke 23, 44. This guy,
[time=2776] this Roman centurion, this is the guy again, as I read about it over the last few weeks, as I've looked at this in the past, most would agree that this guy likely had been involved
[time=2787] himself from the very beginning of the torture and the beating and the murder that had occurred.
[time=2793] This guy had seen it all. He saw the spitting. He saw the crown of thorns. He saw the slapping,
[time=2799] the slugging, the whip, the Jesus collapsing, the walking up the hill, the spikes, the spear
[time=2805] on the side, the whole thing. He had been intimately involved in this process. And now he stands there
[time=2814] at the foot of the cross in 44. It says it was now about the sixth hour and darkness fell over
[time=2820] the whole land until the ninth hour because the sun was obscured and the veil of the temple was torn
[time=2826] and the veil of the temple was torn into. And Jesus, verse 46, crying out with a loud voice,
[time=2833] said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." Having said this, he, Jesus, breathed his last,
[time=2840] his last human breath right there. Boom, it's over. He's dead. And now at this point, verse 47,
[time=2849] when the centurion saw what had happened, a phrase there, not referring to the last breath,
[time=2856] the phrase there, referring to all that had happened, all that they had done,
[time=2862] all the blood that was now on their hands. When he saw what, this is just unbelievable,
[time=2869] it's almost like too unbelievable to grasp, but look what the text says. When he saw what had
[time=2875] happened, he began praising God, something spiritual, something personal, something,
[time=2884] something redemptive, actually, according to the text here, watch, takes place in this guy's heart.
[time=2891] He began praising God, saying, "Certainly this man was innocent and all watched this,
[time=2899] and not just him." And in other gospels, it talks about those guys who were other soldiers
[time=2905] with him, and now here in Luke, it goes even beyond that and says, "And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, when they observed what had happened,
[time=2916] they began." Look what it says, "To return, they had started to come away, they see this whole thing conclude, and then they returned beating their breasts." And all his acquaintances and the women who accompanied him from Galilee were standing at a distance seeing these things. Do you see what happens?
[time=2934] "Beating their breasts." In the Greek, that phrase means the show of remorse,
[time=2942] the show of deep anguish, and the show of regret. They can't believe what they've done.
[time=2950] In other passages in watch that here's so important that you get this, in Matthew and Mark,
[time=2956] while here in Luke it says, "Certainly this man was innocent." In Matthew and Mark, he says, "Truly this was the what? The Son of God." Another declaration of belief,
[time=2970] another declaration of deity, another declaration of kingship, another declaration,
[time=2976] another person in this scene standing there realizing, "Oh my goodness, look what we've done."
[time=2983] And in the, "Oh my goodness, look what we've done," the realization that he was the Son of God,
[time=2989] that centurion realizing that that man they just killed was the source of his own salvation
[time=2999] and regeneration. And here in this moment it says he's praising God and others are coming back.
[time=3005] Can you imagine that scene beating their breasts realizing what they had done and the implications
[time=3012] of what they had done? And here's my question for you today as the team makes their way back up.
[time=3018] Please listen. I bet there are some in the room this morning and when you realize maybe this morning
[time=3024] and maybe you've realized it before, maybe this morning's just another reminder to you of how true this all is, how right God and his redemptive plan for you is. Maybe this morning you sit in
[time=3036] this room or you watch at home as you watch the broadcast or you're listening or watching online
[time=3042] and your thought is conviction. Your response is the centurions. You watch. You can't believe what
[time=3051] you've done. You look at what you've done. You look at where you've gone. You think about for a
[time=3058] moment the choices that you've made and you think, "My goodness, this is all true. Look what I've done."
[time=3066] It's like the biggest nickel in the world dropping and this eternal light coming on and maybe
[time=3072] this morning in the midst of this conviction or realization, it's time for you to fully and
[time=3079] absolutely surrender your heart and life to Christ. Maybe for you this morning, maybe your doubt
[time=3086] isn't really doubt. Maybe it's fear being masked by speculation and questions.
[time=3094] Maybe the places you've gone, maybe the stuff that you've done, maybe the sin that you carry today and the shame that comes with it has kept you at a distance, unwilling, at least to this point
[time=3105] to really bow the knee of your heart and surrender your heart and life to him. You're right when you
[time=3111] say, "Gosh, then he may have some things for me. He may call me to a life that at points might be
[time=3117] costly." I'll tell you that's true, but it's what we've been praying for in these weeks. It's what
[time=3124] we've been hoping for that God would bring people today. We're so grateful for those of you whose response is elation and victorious joy, but those of you who hesitate, those of you who this morning
[time=3137] feel the conviction. I pray that as you take in this last song, that your heart and your soul and
[time=3143] your spirit would be humble enough and willing to say to God in your own words, "Oh God, I'm a sinner and I know it and I know my sin separates me from you and you gave your son to die so I could
[time=3154] live. And I accept that gift. God, I accept your son and I commit myself fully and completely to
[time=3163] honor him and follow you. And we'll be down here at the front afterwards. We'd love nothing more,
[time=3169] you know, trusted friends of yours who you know here. They'd love nothing more. We would be available to you to talk and to think these things through. We want to come alongside you in the days to come. And what a great, great day this day of all days to begin that in your
[time=3184] heart and mind. Be encouraged. Stand if you would quietly. Don't leave. Stand if you would quietly.
[time=3189] And just bask in the great joy and truth of this song.
[time=3209] More than a baby in a manger two nobles would humbly bow their knee for the young man who
[time=3224] heaven knew as Savior. He is alive in thee for the many who walk in water. For the one who calls
[time=3244] blinded eyes to see greater than all the signs and wonders he is alive in me.
[time=3263] He lives. He lives. He conquered the grave, covered our sin. He lives. He lives.
[time=3282] Death could not hold the promise within. He lives.
[time=3296] More than a man. From the same who cried crucified the king. Freely he gave his day to man,
[time=3314] and still he's alive in me. More than a man kind of rich and tender with nails in his hands,
[time=3332] and through his feet. But the end told much more than they expected.
[time=3342] For everyone knows. Free days he rose with power forever too. Free day. You and me.
[time=3359] He lives. He lives. He conquered the grave, covered our sin.
[time=3373] He lives. He lives. Death could not hold the promise within.
[time=3385] More than a man. He lives. He conquered the grave, covered our sin.
[time=3398] He lives. He lives. He lives. Death could not hold the promise within.
[time=3413] He lives. Death where is your secret reigns forever and ever.
