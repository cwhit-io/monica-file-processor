[time=31] - Hi everybody, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] Again, we're thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=35] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving as the senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and we find ourselves at Blackhawk, embarking on a brand new Sunday morning teaching series that you'll see today.
[time=49] It's a series that we're calling Elemental.
[time=52] And let me explain it to you briefly, if I can.
[time=55] I think it's something that you'll want to be a part of.
[time=57] I really think it's something that's going to be not only intriguing, but I think very significant for you, whoever you are in your spiritual journey.
[time=66] Elemental, it's called, here's the idea.
[time=69] Part of what I believe the church has suffered from in the years gone by.
[time=74] Part of the struggle that the church experiences today, when I say the church, I mean the church, the big sea church, the church everywhere.
[time=82] And I think here at Blackhawk, we've struggled with this as well.
[time=86] Part of what happens is this, people begin to think, church leaders can begin to think, church members can begin to think that the end game, that the goal of all this is to see people converted.
[time=100] We'll use that word.
[time=102] Some people begin to think that we do all of this in an effort to see people come to faith.
[time=109] And you might hear me say that and think, well, that's obvious, isn't that why we do what we do?
[time=114] And I wanna just challenge your thinking for a moment on that.
[time=118] I think the scriptures are really clear in the gospels, in the book of Acts and the epistles, all through the scriptures, we see how God's desire for those who come to faith is that they become complete in their faith.
[time=133] Colossians 128 says that we teach and we admonish Paul talks about the purpose of the church being one that has people coming to a place of completion.
[time=143] Jesus wanted those that followed him to be fully devoted disciples.
[time=148] And I think what happens sometimes is that we get excited about conversions and we fail then to move people from that place of conversion to full spiritual maturity.
[time=160] I hope that makes sense.
[time=162] As we studied the gospels in the last year and a half as an elder board and staff here at Blackhawk, we saw Jesus calling those that followed him to a kind of living, to a level of commitment that went far beyond just their initial belief.
[time=177] He called them to a life of absolute sacrifice and service.
[time=182] And there are some elements.
[time=184] There are some components to that life of service, that life of sacrifice, that life of a true disciple that we wanna share with you in the next few weeks.
[time=194] We've discovered five elements and we're gonna look at those elements.
[time=198] Over these next several weeks, we're gonna teach on them and discover together what it means at a very elemental level, at a very foundational level, to be those who follow after the Son of God, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=212] So join us here on the broadcast or come join us in person on Sunday mornings at nine and 1045.
[time=219] We can't wait to see what God's going to do as we give ourselves to this elemental series.
[time=225] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 57 seconds]
[time=291] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=388] (audience applauding) - Beginning this morning, we begin a new series
[time=404] and the intent and hope and purpose of this series is to give you as a family some very, very specific direction and some very, very specific understanding of who it is that we believe God has called you to be and who it is God has called us to be as a church.
[time=426] This has been a discussion and this has been a study that elders and staff over the last year and a half have given themselves to a careful, meticulous, prayerful study of the gospels in the book of Acts and our question had been from the very beginning and our prayer had been from the very beginning.
[time=442] God show us again.
[time=444] We weren't asking for anything new.
[time=445] We were asking for something to be renewed and our prayer was, oh God please show us from your scriptures how it is that you want us to live our lives.
[time=456] Show us how it is you want us to be as individuals and as a body and as we studied the gospels in the book of Acts, he in that way that only he can do, spoke and revealed truth in a powerful, powerful way and we can't wait to beginning today.
[time=472] We can't wait to tell you about it.
[time=474] Share what he revealed and what he brought us to here in his word with you and I want to begin this morning by sharing with you a verse, a verse that in this process of ours as we thought about you and as we thought about this place and its ministry and its reach and our desire for it to be all, hear me, our desire for it to be all that God intended it to be.
[time=497] As we thought about that and prayed about that and sought him over that, there was a verse that we came back to again and again and I want to read that verse to you this morning.
[time=507] It really serves as a foundation for our study.
[time=510] It serves as a foundation for the last year or so of our study as an elder and staff board, its Colossians 128 and it says, and we proclaim him.
[time=520] Remember Paul writing to the church at Colossae.
[time=523] Paul needing to communicate some very foundational stuff to them, they needed some help.
[time=529] So Paul is reminding them how he did what he did and how he wants them to follow suit and Paul says, remember people at the very bottom of this thing, at the very foundation of this thing called the church, we proclaim him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom so that, and here's the kicker, here's the great bottom line on this, so that we may present every man and everybody say that last word out loud, say it, complete.
[time=564] So that we may present every man complete and I want you to think about that.
[time=571] Our hope and our efforts are to be aimed
[time=577] at doing all we can do with God's help, to be the kind of place and to have the kind of ministry that helps you become complete.
[time=586] We're talking spiritually here.
[time=589] Complete, think about the word, complete.
[time=594] The word in the Greek talks about being grown up, talks about being spiritually as mature as you can possibly be.
[time=603] This is a word that describes somebody who has gone through a process of growth and maturation and has come to a place where they are at the end of that process finished.
[time=617] And I mean finished, we mean finished in a good way.
[time=619] God says, Paul says to us here that this process that we're in, this ministry that we're engaged in, is to bring you to a place of spiritual completion, maturity.
[time=630] And probably everybody in the room would agree, wouldn't you?
[time=634] That it's always a better place to be, is it's always better to be grown up than young in some ways.
[time=641] It's always better to be mature than immature.
[time=644] There is such great gain and there is such great perspective and there is such great opportunity that comes with being grown up, mature versus immature and not grown up and not completed.
[time=658] We had a laugh at the night at the house, it was dinner time and everybody scurried in, last minute, grabbed their seat, it was time to pray.
[time=666] We pray, amen, food starts getting passed and nobody had noticed, Jake, my eight year old, kind of just slithered into a seat very inconspicuously.
[time=675] And as soon as we start passing stuff and as soon as we actually start looking at each other, we just absolutely lost it 'cause Jake, just a few minutes earlier had done what many of you have seen happen, this is not a new thing, it's just always funny when it happens.
[time=688] He had found himself right before dinner in the bathroom, staring at himself in the mirror, bored with a pair of scissors looking at his hair.
[time=698] So about 15 minutes later, it's time for dinner, Jake comes sliding into his chair, we pray, we all look up and there's Jake and I'm telling you, that hair, he had taken that hair and he had pulled that stuff up as far as he could pull, he had cut across the hairline.
[time=714] I mean, and it was like he took a ruler, I mean, it was as straight as you can imagine, there were no more bangs, it was absolutely just straight across, you could have put suspenders in a blue shirt on the kid, dropped them off in Harlan, he would have been a great Amish little boy, no problem, I mean, it was just straight, we started calling him Jedidiah instead of Jake.
[time=737] And we just laughed and I thought to myself, you know what, it's just, you know, it's just part of growing up, you're not at 45, not that I'm there, all the way, but you know, at 45, at 36, you know, wherever, you know, you're just at later in life when you're more mature, you don't walk into a bathroom with a pair of scissors and look at your hair in the mirror and go, gee, I think I should cut my hair off across my hairline.
[time=760] We just don't do these kinds of things when we're grown up.
[time=764] We don't do these kinds of things when we're mature.
[time=767] And God reminds us through the words of Paul that our efforts here are to bring you to a place of absolute complete maturity.
[time=776] You are to be completed in this process.
[time=783] Spiritually, here's a picture for you that's not spiritual.
[time=787] Here's a picture for you that's physical, but I just love the picture.
[time=791] I just think it speaks volumes, look at that.
[time=794] Many of you know, many of you have been, all of us who know the Lord were at one time little saplings, just little tiny trees, right?
[time=802] And that's a good thing, God has a great purpose for that.
[time=805] But Paul tells us again that our purpose in ministry here is to help you grow from that to this.
[time=813] Boom, look at that.
[time=814] Isn't that amazing?
[time=817] Isn't that just a great picture?
[time=820] Completion, spiritual completion.
[time=824] Let me come at this from another angle.
[time=827] Let me tell you a story of a situation where this didn't happen.
[time=833] Some friends of mine, don't live locally.
[time=835] They're not here, just some folks I'm aware of who about 10 years ago had a real genuine, and I think God honoring vision to start a church.
[time=843] And their vision to start a church was just born out of their desire, this huge desire in them to see people far from God come to faith in Christ and be saved, and be redeemed and be transformed.
[time=853] So they start this little church and this little church of about 20 or 30 folks with this enormous passion and strategy and plan and prayer, and I mean, they just did their very best to do it in a way that would honor God, but they wanted to see people come to faith, and about 20 or 30 folks turned into about 75 to 100 in the first six months, and in the first year and a half to two years, that 100 turned into about 500, and they just kept retooling and retooling and re-energizing their efforts, and they just stayed so committed to this plan to do their very best to week after week after week, see people come to faith, and the gospel was presented, and it was presented in a number of different ways, and the gospel was taught again and again, and soon, three or 400 became 1,000, and five years into it, it was 2,500, and the thing had absolutely exploded, and they're scurrying around doing their very best to keep up with all this.
[time=915] They changed buildings, went to a bigger high school, hadn't even built their own place yet, and about six, seven years into it, something happened.
[time=925] As they had presented the gospel, and as they had passionately pursued seeing people come to faith in Christ, year after year after year, and as God had blessed that effort, and thousands had responded, there was something that they weren't doing.
[time=941] And at about the seven, eight year mark, attendance began to flatline.
[time=947] The energy in that room, the energy in that family began to fade, giving which had started to climb somewhat in the early years, now had completely bottomed out, serving and volunteerism went down.
[time=964] Relational strife on the staff began to occur.
[time=968] Families were breaking apart.
[time=970] There were factions and divisions and disunity and gossip in the church and to make a longer, sadder story short within about 18 months of their, I think their eight or nine year anniversary, the church had completely and absolutely and utterly imploded.
[time=986] It was gone, absolutely destroyed.
[time=992] And it was an amazing thing and a sad thing to watch, and as I talked with my friends in the days that followed, there were a lot of lessons learned.
[time=1004] There was a lot of wisdom, I think, that God gave them.
[time=1007] I think they wished he would have given it to them earlier, but nonetheless he gave it to them in time.
[time=1012] And I think if you asked them what happened, they would tell you or they would draw a picture for you like this, and I wanna just show you quickly.
[time=1019] What happens so many times is we've got people out in the world, you know 'em and I know 'em, you work with them, they're in your family in mind, they're in your neighborhood.
[time=1026] There's a lot of people out there, my friends who don't know the Lord, and they have questions, spiritual questions.
[time=1032] And so you have spiritually searching people trying to make sense of life who meet you, or they meet me, or they come to a church, or they go to a Bible study or get invited to somebody's home group, and there they meet the person of Christ.
[time=1047] There they meet the Lord, and they learn and understand what it means to bow the knee of their heart and surrender their hearts and lives to Christ, and they experience what we call conversion.
[time=1057] They're saved, they're redeemed, they're changed.
[time=1060] And it's an amazing thing, it's a very, very cool thing.
[time=1063] And oftentimes what happens after they come to faith in Christ, they experience this period of time that we just wrote down crazy, not crazy bad, but like crazy good, they're just so excited, they're so energized, they're so full of this new life and this new hope and this new forgiveness, and they're immersing themselves in God's Word, and they're immersing themselves in prayer like they never did before and they're meeting new people, and the trajectory of their spiritual life begins to just catapult up and to the right.
[time=1094] I mean, they're on their way.
[time=1097] But then something happens, and it happened to those that were in this church that I described to you, and it happens in a lot of other settings too.
[time=1109] What happens is that while God would have wanted, and I believe God designed for them to continue that trajectory up and to the right, as they spiritually grow toward maturity, I think up here we put on their way to being consumed with Christ, on their way to being completed in Christ, they end up two, three years down the line just being cool, comfortable.
[time=1139] They're crazy about Christ and His Word and serving Him,
[time=1145] and they're on their way to being consumed with Him, and yet somehow along the way something goes south, and they end up just being here around, doing their thing, going through the motions.
[time=1164] What happened?
[time=1165] It was interesting as I talked with my friends and it's been interesting as I've watched other situations like this.
[time=1172] I've seen some of that very dynamic, my friends here over the years.
[time=1177] What happens?
[time=1178] How do we get to that?
[time=1180] Well, as I talked with my friends, they said they learned the hard way that they had lacked a clear biblical strategy to move people from crazy about Christ to consumed.
[time=1190] I know that makes a lot of sense.
[time=1192] I know it may sound very basic to you.
[time=1194] They had a great strategy.
[time=1196] They had a great plan.
[time=1197] They had great effort in terms of trying to see people come to faith in Christ.
[time=1202] They lacked a clear biblical strategy and commitment to help people move down that road.
[time=1207] First Colossians 128 to this place of completion.
[time=1212] My friends, church began to struggle.
[time=1214] I think if you just look at that and we could replace crazy, cool and consumed, you could say that in a number of different ways.
[time=1222] You could put thankful on their way to all in, something happened and they just became familiar.
[time=1229] You could say, after coming to faith in Christ, they were newly surrendered and on their way to fully surrender, they ended up, for the most part, surrendered.
[time=1239] You could say after conversion that they were off to a fast start, heading toward Colossians 128, completion, and after a little while, they just ended up flat out spiritually stuck.
[time=1249] And here's my point.
[time=1250] And this is what my friends learned.
[time=1252] Their church was full of stuck, cool, familiar, for the most part surrendered people who had never been grown in their faith.
[time=1264] And when you have a church spiritually full of cool stuck for the most part surrendered people, at the end of the day, those folks don't serve.
[time=1275] They don't give sacrificially.
[time=1276] They don't even get along in time.
[time=1280] And they certainly don't circle back and repeat the process.
[time=1284] That's the great thing about those who are consumed.
[time=1290] They wanna come back and they wanna start that thing all over again.
[time=1294] They wanna influence and impact others.
[time=1297] And those that are in that middle column, my friends, those churches that are filled with stuck, cool, sort of surrendered people, they don't do that.
[time=1306] They're too busy.
[time=1308] They got too many other things going.
[time=1312] There's just too many other distractions and there's just too many other pursuits.
[time=1317] Because somehow along the line, they didn't get grown up.
[time=1322] They didn't get completed tragically.
[time=1325] Listen, tragically people in that church that I'm referring to, and again, we've seen it in other places, they really believed that the church was about conversions instead of completions.
[time=1338] And you can write that down.
[time=1340] They really believed that the church was about conversions instead of being about completions.
[time=1346] And really that forms the basis of what I wanna share with you today, and I sure hope that your heart and your mind and your life are open.
[time=1354] So what God has shown us as a leadership and what we wanna share with you this morning along these lines, let me pray for us and we'll jump in.
[time=1361] God, thank you for the morning and thank you for all of those who are here today.
[time=1365] God, we thank you for this family.
[time=1368] We're grateful for Blackhawk and all that you have done in and through this body for so many years.
[time=1374] And God, as we move toward a renewed vision and a renewed picture of the kind of people you really want us to be individually and God, the kind of family, the kind of ministry you really want us to be.
[time=1387] God, I pray that there would be a humility in this room and a willingness God to listen.
[time=1392] In your son's name, we pray, amen.
[time=1394] Well, hey, in recent days, I have been reminded that in the world of chemistry, chemistry, I know not a word that you would think would come out of my mouth, but bear with me here.
[time=1407] In recent days, I've been reminded that in the world of chemistry, there is something very important known as an element, an element, many of you may be very schooled and well-versed in chemistry and science.
[time=1419] This all may be absolute review for you.
[time=1421] For me, it was kind of, I had to kind of go back to the basics.
[time=1425] I learned that there is something very important known as an element.
[time=1430] An element is a foundational and very strategic component in the world of matter.
[time=1437] In fact, scientists will tell you that elements are the primary constituents.
[time=1442] I love that phrase, write it down.
[time=1444] Scientists will tell you that elements are the primary constituents of any substance.
[time=1451] Very, very important stuff here.
[time=1453] I've learned all over again that in the world of science and substances, elements are absolutely essential.
[time=1460] Absolutely essential.
[time=1461] Take the substance of water, for example.
[time=1465] Take water, cool, refreshing, thirst quenching, life-giving water.
[time=1470] Water is made up of two elements.
[time=1473] Most of you in the room passed chemistry so you can answer the question, what are the two elements that water is made of?
[time=1481] Oxygen and, gosh, you're so smart.
[time=1485] It's a very intelligent church.
[time=1486] Well done, hydrogen and oxygen.
[time=1490] Now, here's where it gets interesting.
[time=1492] Now, if you take away or remove the element of oxygen, let's say, then you no longer have water.
[time=1499] All you have now is this thing called hydrogen.
[time=1503] And let me just give you a visual on this, okay?
[time=1505] This is what you get.
[time=1506] Watch the screens.
[time=1507] This is what you get with both elements present.
[time=1510] The substance you're after here is water.
[time=1512] Here's what happens when you have both elements present.
[time=1515] Hydrogen and oxygen, you get this.
[time=1518] (water splashing)
[time=1527] (water splashing) It's very refreshing, isn't it?
[time=1533] Kind of makes you want to go to sleep.
[time=1535] Those waves, he'd easily listen to at night.
[time=1538] But there it is, water.
[time=1539] Cool, refreshing, life-giving, thirst quenching water.
[time=1544] That's the substance.
[time=1545] Hydrogen, oxygen, boom, you get that.
[time=1548] Here's what you get when you take one, just one of those elements away.
[time=1552] Let's take oxygen away.
[time=1554] And here's what you get.
[time=1557] It's practically standing still now.
[time=1559] They've dropped ropes out of the nose of the ship.
[time=1562] And it's been taken a hold out down on the field by a number of men.
[time=1567] They back-motors of the ship are just holding it just enough to keep it.
[time=1572] (water splashing) It works in the plane, keep it.
[time=1575] Wait, wait.
[time=1576] The other side, it gets it started.
[time=1578] It's right, it's right, it's right.
[time=1580] It's right, it's terrible.
[time=1581] Oh, hi, get out of the way, please.
[time=1583] It's running, pressing in the plane.
[time=1585] And it's falling on the morning fast.
[time=1587] All the folks that need it, that's as terrible.
[time=1589] This is the one of the ones who stands for me.
[time=1591] Just as well.
[time=1593] (water splashing) More 500 feet into the sky.
[time=1597] If that's horrific, great, ladies, gentlemen, that spoke of the slaves now, and the famous stranger to the crowds.
[time=1604] It's not great for the morning fast.
[time=1606] Oh, the humanity, it's all the first.
[time=1608] (mumbles) I told you.
[time=1611] (water splashing) I can't even talk to people.
[time=1614] Those friends are out there.
[time=1616] (mumbles) Oh, I can't talk, ladies and gentlemen.
[time=1621] (water splashing) On it, it's his leg down fast.
[time=1624] (mumbles) One element removed.
[time=1629] Oxygen leaving hydrogen.
[time=1631] And many of you know that clip.
[time=1632] That was the clip of the what?
[time=1634] The Hindenburg.
[time=1636] It took place the year my mom and dad were born.
[time=1638] 1937, May 6th.
[time=1640] Manchester Township, New Jersey.
[time=1642] When a German Zeppelin, they called them, filled with what?
[time=1647] Hydrogen.
[time=1651] Listen.
[time=1652] All matter is made of elements.
[time=1656] And these elements combine to make substances like water, salt, or sugar.
[time=1664] And if for whatever reason, you don't have all the elements, then not only will you not have the substance you're after, but in some cases, like with the Hindenburg, you might even end up with a disaster on your hand.
[time=1682] And I didn't show the Hindenburg thing there to be just dramatic.
[time=1686] It was a disaster of epic proportions.
[time=1690] But I showed it to you because of this.
[time=1692] I believe in some places that a very significant level, the church has encountered a disaster of epic proportions.
[time=1702] And what I mean is this.
[time=1705] And please follow me here.
[time=1707] God's only redemptive plan to reach the world, my friends, is the church.
[time=1712] That's right.
[time=1713] It says it right here in the Scriptures.
[time=1714] God's only redemptive plan, redemptive, redeeming, saving, life, God's only plan to redeem and save a lost and dying world is the church.
[time=1725] Just follow along here on your note sheet.
[time=1727] And for the church to function powerfully, anybody here in the room interested in the church functioning powerfully, for the church to function properly and powerfully, it must be comprised of a specific substance.
[time=1744] Just like a thirsty person needs the substance of water with its essential elements to survive.
[time=1750] So to the church needs a specific and particular substance with its essential elements in order for it to survive, in order for the church to prevail, in order for the church to be and reach its full redemptive potential.
[time=1764] So here is the question.
[time=1768] What is this essential substance?
[time=1771] Write this down.
[time=1772] What is this essential substance that the church must be comprised of?
[time=1779] If it's going to be effective.
[time=1781] What's this essential substance that the church must possess if it's going to be all that God's called it to be?
[time=1789] Some of you in the room, if I just asked you that this morning, you could give me a pretty good answer, I would suspect.
[time=1795] Others of you may be at this point now just really wanting to know.
[time=1798] I could tell you right now, but let's do it this way.
[time=1800] Let me just show you. Can we do that?
[time=1802] Let me just show you from the very pages of Scripture, the answer to that question.
[time=1808] What is the one specific substance and all of its needed elements that the church must possess if the church is going to be all that God called it to be?
[time=1820] 1 Corinthians 11. Would you turn there?
[time=1822] 1 Corinthians 11, chapter 11, verse 1.
[time=1827] It says in 1 Corinthians 11 1, it says, "Be imitators of me." Paul, writing to the church at Corinth.
[time=1834] Paul says to the people, these people that he's responsible for, these people who he wants to see grow, these folks who he wants to see completed.
[time=1843] He says, "Be imitators of me just as I also am of Christ."
[time=1849] Paul says to the church at Corinth, imitate the Lord, imitate Christ.
[time=1856] That phraseology there in the Greek means to be a copy of him.
[time=1860] Be a replica of him. Look and live just like Jesus.
[time=1865] Imitate Christ. Romans 8, 28 and 29.
[time=1871] We find more here in this passage.
[time=1873] Romans 8, 28, very familiar verse.
[time=1876] It says, "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called." That's who this passage is referring to, those who know him, those who have been called, those who are in relationship with him, to those who are called according to his purpose.
[time=1894] And then look at 29, for those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to become, here it is, conformed to the image of his son,
[time=1907] so that he would be the firstborn among many brethren.
[time=1910] It's God's plan. Romans 8, 28 and 29 says, it's God's plan.
[time=1914] And his desire from eternity past, that the church be made up of those who are being conformed in the Greek that means to make into a copy of the image of Christ.
[time=1929] 2 Corinthians 3, 18.
[time=1932] 2 Corinthians 3, 18 says, but we all, very interesting verse, but we all with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror, picture yourself looking into a mirror.
[time=1944] Picture yourself looking into a mirror that just shows you everything.
[time=1948] Everybody in a hotel room where they have those, or maybe you have one in your bathroom, I don't know, I don't have one in my bathroom, but in a hotel room bathroom, sometimes I see these mirrors, they're attached to the wall and they're circular and you kind of pull them out and they're like magnifying.
[time=1961] Raise your hand if you know what I'm talking about.
[time=1963] Wow, like when was the last time you looked into one of those?
[time=1966] I looked into one of those the other day and it was scary.
[time=1970] It was scary, it was embarrassing.
[time=1972] I don't want to tell you what I saw, it was horrible.
[time=1974] It was so disappointed in what I saw.
[time=1978] Hair, okay, I'll just tell you, a hair, not in my nose, but growing on top of my nose.
[time=1985] That's too gross, sorry.
[time=1988] But we all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror, looking into a mirror, the glory of the Lord are being transformed as we look into this mirror into the same what?
[time=2000] Say it out loud.
[time=2001] Image, from glory to glory, just as from the Lord the Spirit uses the illustration of a mirror to point out how over time and with an unobstructed and intimate view of Christ we are being transformed into the same image, his image.
[time=2016] First Peter 1, track with me here, stay with me.
[time=2019] 1/14 through 16.
[time=2021] 1 Peter 1, 14 to 16.
[time=2023] Peter reminds us, as obedient children, 1 Peter 1, 14, as obedient children do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance.
[time=2035] He goes on to say in 15, "But like the holy one who called you, but like the one who called you which was the Lord, be holy yourselves." He says, "In all your behavior," and here it is in 16, but as it is written, "You shall be holy," because why?
[time=2052] For I am holy.
[time=2054] Imitate me.
[time=2056] Copy me.
[time=2057] Come after the image of me.
[time=2062] Peter reminds those in the church who were suffering under Nero's persecution, that if the church was going to persevere, then they had to imitate the Lord and his holiness.
[time=2072] 1 Thessalonians 1, 6 through 7.
[time=2077] He says, "You also became imitators of us." Paul talking to the church at Thessalonica, a church which had done really, really well.
[time=2085] Thessalonica was probably the best church of all the churches we see in the New Testament.
[time=2090] Thessalonica, God did something really special there and they had progressed and they had made movement that just thrilled and brought joy to Paul's heart.
[time=2099] 1 Thessalonians 1 is a celebration of this great church in Thessalonica and one of the things that he celebrates.
[time=2106] You church also became everybody say it out loud.
[time=2110] Imitators.
[time=2112] When I say everybody say it out loud, do you think I'm kind of suggesting that you say it out loud?
[time=2119] Are you asleep?
[time=2120] Do you care?
[time=2123] You also became everybody say it out loud.
[time=2126] God, thank you.
[time=2132] And of the Lord, not just imitators of us, but imitators of who?
[time=2136] Of Christ.
[time=2137] Now you're good.
[time=2138] Thank you.
[time=2139] See?
[time=2141] Having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit,
[time=2147] Paul describes what was according to most scholars, the most effective, most successful church of their time.
[time=2152] And he describes how they were able to become impactful and effective.
[time=2156] They had become imitators.
[time=2159] Let me ask you the question again.
[time=2161] What's the substance?
[time=2163] What's the one substance that a church must be comprised of in order for it to experience
[time=2171] its full, redemptive potential?
[time=2175] You could ask it this way.
[time=2177] A church must be or you could say it this way.
[time=2179] A church must be made up of those who are, boom, in order for that church to grow and flourish.
[time=2186] You know, Jesus knew all about this as well.
[time=2189] Paul wasn't the only one who understood this great truth.
[time=2191] Jesus himself said it in a number of different ways again and again and again.
[time=2195] Just a couple of instances where we see it in Jesus' life.
[time=2199] Look at John 13.
[time=2201] John 13, 12 to 15.
[time=2204] Jesus says, you see it there.
[time=2208] So when he had washed their feet and taken his garments and reclined at the table, he said to them,
[time=2214] do you know what I have done to you?
[time=2218] You call me teacher and Lord and you are right for so I am.
[time=2223] If then the Lord and the teacher washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
[time=2230] And here it is.
[time=2231] For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you.
[time=2239] Copy me, imitate me.
[time=2243] What I did, you do.
[time=2245] I left you this example, he says.
[time=2250] There's another place later in the Scriptures in 1 Peter 2 where he leaves us yet another example
[time=2257] and leaves us with that same call.
[time=2259] Look at 1 Peter 2.
[time=2262] It says in 1 Peter 2 21, "For you have been called," Peter says to the believers as he writes this letter.
[time=2267] He says, "You have been called for this purpose since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you in a what?"
[time=2274] Say it.
[time=2275] An example for you to follow in his steps.
[time=2279] For you have been called for this purpose since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to imitate.
[time=2288] An example for you to follow.
[time=2292] Let's just get it out on the table here.
[time=2294] My friends, a growing, fruitful, effective church.
[time=2297] A church that experiences the fullness of what God's designed, the church to be, is comprised of Jesus' imitators.
[time=2304] I hope you'll write it down.
[time=2307] I hope you'll begin today to hide this in your heart.
[time=2310] I hope this is something that today you'll begin to interact with with us.
[time=2314] I hope this is something that you'll hang on to.
[time=2316] A growing, fruitful, effective church.
[time=2319] That experiences the fullness of what God designed the church to be is comprised of Jesus' imitators.
[time=2327] The prerequisite substance, then back to our chemistry, right?
[time=2331] The prerequisite substance required for the church to prevail and succeed is it must be made up of those who are all in.
[time=2340] Those who are fully surrendered.
[time=2342] Those who aren't stuck, not those who are familiar or cool, but those who are on their way toward completion.
[time=2348] Christ followers, disciples, my friends, disciples of Jesus.
[time=2353] Remember, there are some who think that this is all about conversion.
[time=2357] What we learn from our Lord is that this is all about completion.
[time=2361] The conversion is a wonderful thing.
[time=2363] The conversion is a cause for joy and celebration, but there begins the process.
[time=2368] The process of completion, which, and I want to tell you this, and this is hard for me to read to you.
[time=2377] In some ways, it really is.
[time=2379] What I'm about to read to you is hard for me to read to you.
[time=2385] It's hard to read it to you because there is so much about what I'm about to read that me personally, I haven't gotten figured out yet.
[time=2397] I'm still working on it.
[time=2399] There's so much about what I'm going to read to you here.
[time=2401] These are Jesus' words about being a disciple.
[time=2406] These are Jesus' words that I'm about to read to you from Luke 14, where he describes what this life that we've been talking about this morning, what this life's supposed to look like.
[time=2419] This is Jesus kind of raising the bar on what should be normative for you and me, and sometimes I get scared.
[time=2428] You know, I shouldn't be.
[time=2429] I should be bold and confident.
[time=2431] Sometimes I get scared to say all this to you because I know for some of you you won't like it.
[time=2437] I know there are some who have left, you know, even in recent days, who have even told me they sensed the bar being raised way too high.
[time=2446] I know that there is enough sinfulness in you, like there is enough sinfulness in me, to hear this, and instead of being drawn to it,
[time=2458] there can be thoughts, and there can be reactions in you and me that make us want to run a thousand miles an hour in the other direction.
[time=2465] But you know what, my friends, it's the truth.
[time=2467] It really is the truth.
[time=2468] And here's what Jesus said about discipleship.
[time=2473] He says in Luke 14, 25, he says, "Now large crowds were going along with him."
[time=2479] And he turned, that was a very significant phrase there, "large crowds," Jesus loved the people, but he often knew that in large crowds there was the ability to just kind of skate.
[time=2491] In large crowds, there's sometimes the opportunity for folks to just kind of blend in.
[time=2499] And it says here, "Large crowds were going along with him, and he turned." Can you see him?
[time=2505] He turns and stops and says to the large crowd, "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters,
[time=2524] yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my what?" Say it out loud.
[time=2532] "Whoever does not carry his own cross," a phrase indicating and referencing great suffering and the payment of a price, "Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my what?"
[time=2547] Say it out loud.
[time=2554] For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and, and I want you to write this down, calculate the cost.
[time=2562] Calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it.
[time=2567] Now I don't think for a moment my friends that Jesus was saying there that you shouldn't love your mother.
[time=2572] I don't think Jesus is saying you shouldn't love your father. I don't think Jesus is saying you shouldn't love your spouse.
[time=2578] He's not saying you should really hate your kids.
[time=2581] What he's saying is that in comparison to your kids and your spouse and your mother and father, you should love him what more.
[time=2591] That's what he's saying.
[time=2593] And that's how a disciple thinks, and that's how a disciple lives, and that's what a disciple pursues, loving him that much.
[time=2601] Loving him being that important, that doing what's right, and doing what's honorable, and doing what's obedient becomes the highest and most attractive call, not keeping family members happy.
[time=2619] This is what he called his followers to, and this is what he calls you and I to this morning.
[time=2625] And I've got to stop right here before we go any further this morning or before we go any further in these next five weeks.
[time=2632] And I've got to ask you, those of you that are here, those of you that still have ears to hear and are willing to listen, I've got to ask you, do you want to be a disciple?
[time=2644] Do you want to be really young people, 15, 16 year olds, do you really want to be a young man or a young woman that follows after our Lord?
[time=2655] Because there's a cost that you're going to have to calculate.
[time=2659] Moms and dads and single adults and senior adults, I mean everybody in the room, if you know him, I just got to ask you right here, is this really what you want to be about?
[time=2669] It's really what we're going to be about in the days to come.
[time=2676] Now back to our chemistry and science lesson.
[time=2679] What we've learned today about substances is this, you only get the substance Jesus imitators.
[time=2688] You only get the substance you're after when you have the right elements.
[time=2692] And just like with water and it's required elements of oxygen and hydrogen being a Jesus imitator, being a disciple requires certain, very specific.
[time=2705] Right here we get to read about them and study them elements.
[time=2710] And it's why we've entitled our series Elemental.
[time=2713] Let me just invite you to read this with me.
[time=2715] Would you please?
[time=2716] One studies the Scriptures. One sees clearly that there are some elemental disciplines and pursuits that Jesus called his followers to embrace.
[time=2728] Jesus taught about these elements.
[time=2731] He modeled the practice of these elements.
[time=2735] He rebuked those he loved when these elements were missing from their lives and he encouraged them when these elements were present.
[time=2743] Jesus in essence said that for those who would follow after or imitate him, these elements would need to be the, here it is, the primary constituents of their faith and practice.
[time=2759] And I want to be really upfront with you here.
[time=2761] We by no means as a leadership stand here before you this morning and say there are five and only five.
[time=2768] And in all of Scripture there are just five elements. No, there could be eight, nine, ten, twenty seven as we hear me, as we honestly went before God over the last year, year and a half.
[time=2779] We begged him to show us so that we could teach you.
[time=2784] We begged him to reveal to us so that we could communicate it to you.
[time=2788] We begged him to make very clear to us the elements he wanted us to latch on to and pursue and give ourselves to.
[time=2797] And he gave us five really, really clearly as we studied what disciples did and as we read and watched how they lived.
[time=2806] And most importantly as we watched our Lord and how he lived and what he did, five elements.
[time=2812] And I want to just list him for you this morning and I hope as I list these elements these are the things we'll teach about in the weeks to come.
[time=2820] I hope as you listen, I hope your heart and mind begin to expand with what this could be like for you individually as a disciple.
[time=2829] And I hope your heart and mind will begin to expand as to what this could be like for our church and for this ministry that God's given us.
[time=2837] As we studied the Gospels in the Book of Acts and really the Epistles as well, the whole New Testament as we looked at those who followed after Christ,
[time=2845] we found that disciples, we found that Jesus' imitators were deeply committed to prayerful abiding.
[time=2854] Would you write that down? To prayerful abiding. This element speaks of one's personal and intimate connection to the Lord.
[time=2863] This prayerful abiding talks, the word abiding is a great word, we'll get into it next week. It talks about being very intricately and intimately woven and intermeshed and solidly connected.
[time=2876] Abiding is in, abiding is there, I'm with you, you're with me, we're together abiding. And the disciples and our Lord modeled this in amazing ways, this prayerful, thoughtful desire to be with the Father.
[time=2894] And again and again we see Jesus slipping away from the crowds to prayerfully be with whom? God.
[time=2902] Again and again we see the early church, again and again we see in the life of Jesus and the disciples as they ministered for three years this value, prayerful abiding.
[time=2913] In our study we saw that those who followed after Christ, those who imitated Him and Christ Himself were deeply devoted to the Scriptures.
[time=2921] There is in the life of a Jesus imitator going to be a deep and unbroken commitment to the authority and the power of God's Word. Jesus modeled this in a miraculous way as He goes into the desert.
[time=2938] Remember the desert and the temptations from Satan and how Satan tempts Jesus and again and again. Jesus responds to Satan with the very words of who? God.
[time=2949] With the very words of Scripture, that first church in Acts 2 and Acts 3 and Acts, we see the first church whenever they would gather, wherever they would go, they were devoted.
[time=2960] Remember that word we talked about it a few months ago, they were obstinately committed to the teaching of God's Word.
[time=2967] God's Word, the Scriptures. Prayerful abiding, devotion to the Scriptures, missional serving. We saw in our study that those who imitated Jesus and Jesus Himself, it was like breathing my friends.
[time=2982] It wasn't even like an effort, it was just wherever they went and there's the missional component because they were always on the move, they were always going, it was always about others.
[time=2992] There was this mission that they had and it was about other people so as they went to other people they just served. They just met needs.
[time=3001] They just went out of their way to do whatever they needed to do to meet the needs of these people both physically and spiritually, missional serving, transformational community.
[time=3012] We saw again and again in our study that those that followed after Christ were those who were engaged in community, they were engaged in a depth of relationship where there was intimacy and honesty and accountability.
[time=3027] And they were those that followed after Jesus and those in the early church, they were committed to community because guess who taught them about community? Jesus taught them about it and Jesus modeled it, he did it with them.
[time=3044] He lived in relationship with them and it was a level of relationship, there was a depth of relationship that God uses to change you, to transform you.
[time=3056] When you experience the one and others together, when sins are confessed and when needs are shared and when encouragement is given and when accountability is really practiced, God uses that kind of community to be transformational in your life and mind.
[time=3074] As we studied, we saw also that those who followed after Jesus and Jesus himself, obviously on this one, they were deeply devoted to making other disciples.
[time=3086] Imagine we've walked our way down these list of five, the picture I want you to have is having experienced prayerful abiding and having experienced the commitment to God's word and having served missionally and having been engaged in transformational community.
[time=3103] Now the Jesus imitator gets to this point where he kind of looks back and he just can't wait and Jesus did it all the time, he just can't wait to come back here.
[time=3113] Remember the question mark and the confused picture up on the screen, they're just going to reach out, redemptively build relationships with others and experience the joy of making disciples, of walking others through this very same process.
[time=3132] So that's where we're going, can you imagine, can you imagine your life with these five elements, completely and absolutely in play?
[time=3145] I mean, can you imagine my life, can we imagine a place, a people, completely devoted to growing in these five elements?
[time=3155] I can and I get very, very excited about it and I can't wait to tell you more, I'm going to ask Corbin in the band to come up, please don't leave, please stay and we're going to just respond to this and worship this morning.
[time=3167] I hope you'll lift your voices, I hope you'll cry out to God, I hope you'll thank him, I hope with our voices lifted and a song of praise on our lips as we close.
[time=3178] I hope that God can be honored and I want to just ask if you would stay seated and go ahead and stand and let's worship our God together.
[time=3188] Just challenged as I was listening to Kelly's words, that if I need to be a Jesus imitator, then I need to know Jesus and I challenge you with that too.
[time=3199] What can you do to know him better, what can you be reading and studying to know our Jesus as we attempt by God's grace to imitate him?
[time=3208] We're going to sing a song together here that we'll be singing several times throughout this series.
[time=3212] It's called Jesus Messiah and a chance for us to just sing about who he is in our attempt to know him and imitate him.
[time=3220] So join me in any place where you feel like you know the song.
[time=3250] Jesus Messiah, name above all names.
[time=3269] Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel.
[time=3280] The rescue for sinners, the reigns of brotherhood.
[time=3292] Jesus Messiah, Lord of all.
[time=3304] His body, the prayer, His blood, the wine, broke it and poured out all for them.
[time=3316] The Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[time=3336] Jesus Messiah, name above all names.
[time=3347] Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel.
[time=3358] The rescue for sinners, the reigns of brotherhood.
[time=3370] Jesus Messiah, Lord of all.
[time=3382] What I love is in you, but what love is in you.
[time=3394] What love is in you, God.
[time=3402] The light of the world, Jesus Messiah, name above all names.
[time=3420] Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel.
[time=3431] The rescue for sinners, the reigns of brotherhood.
[time=3443] Jesus Messiah, Lord of all.
[time=3454] Jesus Messiah, Lord of all, the Lord of all.
[time=3482] [AMEN]
