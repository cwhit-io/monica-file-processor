[time=31] - From Romans 5.8, this reminds us that we have forgiveness when we sin.
[time=36] But you, O God, demonstrate your own love for us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=45] And to remind us of the freedom we have over the power that sin can hold in our lives, Colossians 2, verses 11 and 12, let's pray this.
[time=56] In you, O Christ, I was circumcised with a circumcision made without hands.
[time=63] In the removal of the body of the flesh by your circumcision, having been buried with you in baptism and raised with you through faith in the working of God who raised you from the dead and from Philippians 1.
[time=80] I eagerly expect in hope that I will no way be ashamed
[time=86] but will have sufficient courage so that now as always you, Jesus Christ, will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
[time=97] For to me, to live in you, Jesus Christ means everything and to die is game.
[time=104] And then this verse from 2 Corinthians that I love, let's pray that the spirit of Christ would manifest itself in and through us.
[time=115] Thanks be to God who always leads in triumph in you and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of you.
[time=126] Just take a minute to be still and quiet and reflect on these truths in your own hearts.
[time=132] And maybe, Katie, you can just flip through these different scriptures as we pray and just ask Christ to complete the work in you and to make your heart be like his as we attempt to imitate his ways.

[time=516] - Well hello again everybody, welcome back to the broadcast.
[time=519] We're thankful that you've tuned in today.
[time=521] I am so grateful for the Bible hour and every week the opportunity God gives us to encourage and speak truth into the hearts and lives of people just like you.
[time=532] I want to take just a moment today and invite those of you who have children and they may be really young kids and you may just have one or you might be in the throes of adolescents and you may have a few teenagers running around your home.
[time=548] Whether you've got some little ones or some older ones.
[time=551] If you've got kids, I just want to run this by you and I want you to listen today to the message.
[time=557] I really want you to open your heart and your mind to what you're about to hear because it is absolutely in many respects I think staggering.
[time=566] Absolutely convicting, unbelievably encouraging in some senses, but my studies in the last couple of weeks on this topic of discipleship, which we're now in here at Blackhawk on Sunday mornings.
[time=581] It has led me to the understanding of how parents back in first century Jewish culture and how children prepared to be disciples.
[time=593] There was this amazing process that parents would have their kids go through at the age of five, six years of age, this process would begin.
[time=603] And I don't want to tell you everything right now that you're going to hear in the message, but here's the point I want to make.
[time=608] I really want you to be honest today.
[time=610] Will you do that?
[time=611] Will you be honest with yourself?
[time=614] And will you be honest and sincere about the way you are depositing, the way you are investing God's truth into the heart and life of your child?
[time=625] I don't think you need me to sit here and tell you.
[time=627] I think all of us for the most part understand that the degree to which our children have the truth, the degree to which our kids, yours and mine, have the truth of God's word deposited and invested into their hearts and lives is the degree to which they will, Joshua says in chapter one, experience success.
[time=647] That's right, when the word of God is something that they're able to feed on, when the word of God is something that they're able to hide in their hearts, when the word of God finds its way into the deepest part of who they are, then you and I can be encouraged, you and I can be hopeful that the life they will lead and the experience they will have will be one that honors and brings great glory to God.
[time=673] The way the Jews did this with their little ones, the way they prepared their little ones to hopefully be disciples is absolutely amazing and I want you to listen and I want you to open your heart and mind and as you hear the message today, think to yourself, oh God, pray, oh God, how can I as a parent?
[time=693] What can we do as a mom and a dad?
[time=696] Maybe you're a mom on your own, maybe you're a dad on your own, maybe you're a grandma and grandpa and you have unbelievable opportunities with your grandchildren that today as you listen, maybe your prayer could just be, oh God, please help me see how I could invest more of your truth into the heart and life of my little one.
[time=716] Hey, thank you so much for these few minutes.
[time=718] Thanks for listening.
[time=719] Thank you for being a part of our family.
[time=721] We'd love to have you come and meet us.
[time=723] We'd love to put some names with some faces.
[time=726] We're here every Sunday, nine and 1045 and we'd love to have you with us.
[time=730] God bless you.
[time=731] Have a great week.
[time=732] [MUSIC - 102 seconds]
[time=839] - So I'll stand together and sing this next verse.
[time=851] (upbeat music)
[time=858] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=915] (gentle music)
[time=945] (singing in foreign language)
[time=975] (gentle music)
[time=1004] - Lord God our hearts are full of hallelujah's.
[time=1008] Praise it belongs to you.
[time=1011] You are the risen lamb,
[time=1018] the perfect spotless righteousness.
[time=1020] You who knew no sin became sin on our behalf
[time=1026] so that we might become the righteousness of God and our hearts will sing hallelujah today and tomorrow and forever you are worthy.
[time=1037] Amen, you may be seated.
[time=1042] - Well, all right, if you were here last week,
[time=1053] then you know that we've recently jumped into a brand new series here at Blackhawk.
[time=1058] And as I told you last week, I'll tell you again today, it is a very, very important series, my friends.
[time=1065] As your pastor and friend and as a spokesman for those who lead and love this place on behalf of our elder team and our staff team, I just wanna tell you, there has been a great deal of thought and time and prayer that has gone into what you will hear in these next several weeks.
[time=1083] And what you will hear, we believe, is extremely important to the life and to the future.
[time=1090] This place and these people that God has gathered in this ministry that He has given us.
[time=1095] And I for one am extremely looking forward to what lies ahead as we have the privilege of sharing with you kind of the results, if you will, of a study, a prayerful look at the scriptures that we as a leadership have been giving ourselves to over the last year and a half.
[time=1110] And we jumped in last week and I tried to begin to describe for you where we were headed.
[time=1116] And if you weren't here, let me just catch up.
[time=1119] If you were here, quick review, you all who were here kind of endured a very brief, very simple chemistry lesson.
[time=1127] And in that chemistry lesson, we tried our very best to communicate to you something very, very important, something very, very foundational to this study and the weeks to come.
[time=1138] As you can see on the screen, we've entitled this series, "Elemental." And here's how we started and this is where we're headed.
[time=1145] In our chemistry discussion, we begin to talk about substances and we begin to talk about how substances are made up of elements and it went something like this.
[time=1154] Take water, for instance.
[time=1156] We said if you're thirsty, if you need your thirst quenched, then you and I, when we get thirsty, we need the substance called water.
[time=1166] And in the chemistry, you know, scientific world water is a substance and we noted that the only way you can possess the substance called water is if you have the right elements, the right elements of water being hydrogen and what?
[time=1181] Oxygen, great job and thanks for speaking up.
[time=1184] I hope I didn't come down too hard on you last week.
[time=1187] You guys are great.
[time=1189] So if you're thirsty, you need your thirst quenched.
[time=1192] If you need your thirst quenched, you need the substance called water and the only way you're gonna get water is if you have something that has the right elements and if you got the right elements, you got water.
[time=1200] And if you don't have the right elements, you don't have water.
[time=1205] Now let's move from the physical arena to the spiritual.
[time=1208] Maybe it's not that you're thirsty.
[time=1213] Maybe you've got some real strong yearnings and desires for the church, let's say.
[time=1218] Let's come at it that way.
[time=1219] If you long to see God use the church to redeem and restore a broken world, and let me just stop right there because sometimes guys like me say things like that and we just assume everybody in the room feels about that the way we feel about that.
[time=1235] Do you feel that way about that?
[time=1237] Do you really long?
[time=1241] I mean, do you really down deepen your gut, really down deep inside want to be a part of a church?
[time=1246] Do you wanna see the church?
[time=1248] Do you wanna see God use his bride to redeem and restore?
[time=1253] To bring justice.
[time=1256] Stony and I talked about a few weeks ago.
[time=1258] Does it run deep in you?
[time=1259] Do you really long to see God use the church to redeem and restore a broken world, a broken, cracked, absolutely far from what God designed world?
[time=1271] Do you long to see God use the church to do that, to redeem and restore?
[time=1278] Do you really?
[time=1279] If you do, then what we learned last week is that you need the church then to possess, the church then if it's going to fulfill that kind of mission, the church has to possess the substance called disciples.
[time=1297] The church must be comprised of the substance called Jesus imitators and the only way you get a disciple, the only way you get a Jesus imitator is if you have the right elements.
[time=1311] And this my friends is where we come to elemental, prayerful abiding.
[time=1318] I'm glad they got the banners up this week.
[time=1322] Just a visual reminder, prayerful abiding in our study of the gospels and the book of Acts, my friends, we saw again and again that those who were deeply devoted to our Lord.
[time=1334] We saw again and again that the Lord Himself was deeply devoted to these elements.
[time=1341] Prayerful abiding, a commitment to the word of God,
[time=1347] a deep and ongoing commitment to serving, serving those above you, serving those below you, serving those on your side, serving wherever you go missionally as God sends us a willingness to serve and to give ourselves away for the sake of others.
[time=1364] Five elements, prayerful abiding, a commitment to the scriptures, serving community, transformational community, life together at a level and with a purpose whereby God transforms us as we live and experience the one and others of scripture together.
[time=1385] Disciples, those that followed our Lord experienced that in spades.
[time=1391] It was everywhere because Jesus taught it and Jesus modeled it.
[time=1395] And then lastly, the fifth symbol you see up there making disciples, making disciples.
[time=1401] Five elements and these are the truths, my friends.
[time=1404] These are the disciplines that we wanna do our very best to teach you and communicate with you about, to model for you these five elements we will do our very best to keep it the forefront of all we do and all we're about in this place in the days to come.
[time=1420] And before we jump in though to the first one, before we jump into prayerful abiding, this morning I wanna just take a few minutes and we'll see how far we go here.
[time=1430] I want us to understand a couple of very important truths about being a disciple.
[time=1436] If discipleship, if being a disciple is that the absolute foundation of this endeavor as I read this week and as I was reminded on several fronts this week about the unique calling and the unique privilege of being a disciple.
[time=1452] I wrote some things down and I wanna share them with you this morning.
[time=1455] Some very important truths about a disciple of Jesus Christ, disciple.
[time=1460] Just say that word, everybody say that word out loud right now, disciple, go.
[time=1463] Yeah, see, I don't know what do you think when you say that word?
[time=1468] Honestly, you just go with me here for a moment.
[time=1471] Sometimes when I say the word disciple, sometimes in the years past it's just felt kind of a little, I don't know, a little out there.
[time=1479] It's just felt kind of removed from the everyday of our vernacular, say it again, disciple.
[time=1484] Sometimes I feel like it's, you know, something my grandparents used to talk about.
[time=1490] Sometimes I've noticed in our culture today we've kind of tried to replace that term by coming up with other terms that kind of communicate the same thing.
[time=1499] So we're not saying disciple, we're saying, you know, something else, but yet I feel like the more and more I'm at this and the more and more I keep reading and studying this.
[time=1508] I feel like it just keeps coming back again and again to say it, disciple, disciple.
[time=1516] So it might be a phrase that kind of feels a little out there for you.
[time=1519] It might be a phrase you don't feel real comfortable with.
[time=1521] I just hope, I hope today, especially as we talk more about what it meant to be a disciple.
[time=1527] I hope today and I hope in the weeks to come it's something that your, I hope God does something in your heart and soul that allows you to hang on to that phrase and to hang on to what it means and to hang on to what you and I are called to in our pursuit of it.
[time=1542] I hope the whole disciple thing becomes something that you and I become very, very, very comfortable with and thankful for.
[time=1550] It's a very Jewish Hebrew concept that was reminded of that again this week.
[time=1556] And when you really take the time to understand the first century cultural backdrop to the notion of disciples and rabbis when you really look into that then you get to see the full depth of meaning and application that's really there for you and I to grab hold of today whenever we talk about being disciples.
[time=1576] So just real quickly here, two things I wanna make sure that you and I are on the same page about two things about disciples and where this whole notion came from.
[time=1584] The motivation and commitment to be one which you'll see in a few minutes was absolutely huge.
[time=1590] Again, this is all kind of under the context or under the umbrella of the first century cultural backdrop.
[time=1597] The motivation and commitment to be one.
[time=1600] And secondly, I wanna just make sure you understand who got to be, who got to be one?
[time=1605] Who got to be a disciple?
[time=1607] Let's start with the motivation and the commitment to be a disciple and it was interesting.
[time=1612] It was mind-boggling all over again for me to read through church history accounts of this endeavor.
[time=1621] It was incredible to read guys like Dwight Pryor and Ray Vanderlawn.
[time=1624] It was interesting again to break open some of the books in my library having to do with the customs and traditions of the first century church and all that was going on in Jewish culture.
[time=1636] The word for disciple and the Hebrew language is the word Talmede and then you can write that down and I hope you picked up a note sheet on your way in.
[time=1645] The word for disciple is the Hebrew word Talmede and it's a word that meant student, it meant learner, it meant follower.
[time=1652] And here's the deal you guys, okay, here we go.
[time=1655] Watch this.
[time=1656] In that day, in that culture, in that first century cultural backdrop, every little boy wanted to be one.
[time=1667] It was just the way it was.
[time=1671] It was the way life just kind of rolled out in those days.
[time=1674] It was what was at the top of the ladder in terms of what every little boy hoped someday he could be.
[time=1682] Every little guy in Jewish first century culture grew up and every little guy's mom and every little guy's dad and every little guy's uncle wanted that little boy to somehow someday hopefully grow up to be a disciple.
[time=1696] There were no Bill Gates.
[time=1698] There was no Peyton Manning.
[time=1700] There was no Michael Jordan.
[time=1702] There was no American idol.
[time=1704] All those little guys wanted to be when they grew up was they wanted to be a disciple.
[time=1712] And if they were fortunate enough, I mean really fortunate enough, they might even someday become a rabbi.
[time=1719] And the rabbis in that culture, as I read again this week, I was reminded the rabbis in that day were it.
[time=1726] The rabbis were at the top of the pyramid.
[time=1729] The rabbis were, as one author said, and I noted it here, the rabbis were gods.
[time=1736] And isn't it amazing that God and his choice to come to earth actually came in human form as a what?
[time=1743] Rabbi.
[time=1745] So here's how it worked.
[time=1749] And we talked briefly about this about three years ago at Christmas.
[time=1754] And so some of you may remember this, others of you may not.
[time=1757] But let me just, let's dig in a little deeper this morning.
[time=1760] At the age of six, here's how it worked.
[time=1762] At the age of six, raise your hand if you're the parent of a six year old boy or girl.
[time=1768] Raise your hand if you've ever had a kid who was six.
[time=1772] All right, thank you.
[time=1772] So we're all in the same ballpark here, right?
[time=1775] Think about your six year old.
[time=1777] Think about the one who was most recently six in your home, or think about the six year old that you have now.
[time=1783] At the age of six, little boys and girls began their spiritual religious education, their preparation for the future, in what was called Betz Affair.
[time=1794] Betz Affair.
[time=1795] And what those little, this was the class, this took place at the synagogue, this was run by the rabbis, and they would enter into Betz Affair.
[time=1805] And what these little six, seven, eight, nine year olds in Betz Affair would do is they would memorize word for word and concept for concept, don't miss that.
[time=1816] Not just word for word, but concept for concept.
[time=1820] And that would happen, yes, through rote memorization, but the concept by concept would happen through dialogue and discourse about the things that they were reading.
[time=1830] Those little guys and girls starting at the age of six in Betz Affair would memorize the Torah.
[time=1836] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, numbers, Deuteronomy.
[time=1842] All of it, word for word, concept by concept,
[time=1849] day after day after day.
[time=1852] Thinking about your six year old, or your seven year old, I was struck by an example I read in one of the readings that I had this week, as I was thinking about this, one of the scholars said that they would at a very early age, at six, seven, when they were first starting.
[time=1870] The rabbis would often with these little guys and gals as they would come in and sit down and they'd have their slates, the little things they would write on.
[time=1879] And some of you may have heard this before, but the rabbi would literally put a dollop of honey, dollop of honey on the top corner of their slate.
[time=1889] They would do it midday when the child was hungry and looking for something to eat and they would put the honey on their slate.
[time=1898] And then that rabbi would in the moments that followed,
[time=1904] teach that little six, seven year old heart from places like Psalm 1910, where it says the word of God is sweeter than what?
[time=1913] Honey, and sweeter than the drippings of the honeycomb.
[time=1916] They began at a very early age to instill into the hearts and minds of these little guys and gals, the absolute strength and beauty and satisfaction that came with knowing and understanding and taking in God's word.
[time=1932] Bates of Fair, six on up to about the age of 10.
[time=1938] Around the age of 10, the rabbis who ran the schools would then have to tell many of the young boys and girls that their time was up.
[time=1948] As the rabbis would watch them and as the rabbis would interact with them, it would be clear to the rabbis that they were good boys and girls.
[time=1956] They loved God and they had a respect for the scriptures, but they probably just didn't have what it was gonna take for them to really progress in their pursuit of someday possibly maybe being a rabbi's disciple, so they would be sent home.
[time=1973] They would be sent home to begin the process of learning the family trade.
[time=1978] They would at age 10 as boys and girls begin to learn about what it is they would be doing now for the rest of their lives as they came alongside their moms and their dads and their families.
[time=1989] But to the highly gifted and the highly talented, they would say, let's keep going.
[time=1998] If they felt like in their heart of hearts that that young man actually might have what it would take to actually someday be a disciple, then they would give that young man and in this middle stage, even some young ladies that chance to move forward.
[time=2015] And at this point, they would enter into what was called Beit Talmud.
[time=2019] At this point, they would enter the next level of the rabbis, spiritual and religious preparation, Beit Talmud.
[time=2025] And in Beit Talmud between the ages of 10 and 14, raise your hand right now if you have a child and you're home between the ages of 10 and 14.
[time=2034] All right, think about those.
[time=2037] Raise your hand if you've ever had a kid between 10 and 14.
[time=2039] All right, thanks.
[time=2040] I just don't wanna leave anybody out.
[time=2042] I hate leaving people out.
[time=2043] And Beit Talmud between the ages of 10 and 14, they would memorize, you ready for this?
[time=2049] They would memorize the rest of the Hebrew scriptures.
[time=2054] Genesis to Malachi.
[time=2061] Hey, do this.
[time=2062] You got your Bibles?
[time=2064] Of course you do.
[time=2065] Go in your Bible and just put your hand in it, Genesis.
[time=2069] All right, go ahead, everybody.
[time=2071] Go ahead, open your Bibles and put your hand in.
[time=2072] I did this first hour.
[time=2073] It was just shocking.
[time=2075] Go to Genesis and put one hand in there and then just go to Malachi chapter four.
[time=2082] Go to the end of Malachi four and then just kind of put your hand in there and just hold that baby in your lap and then just kind of just do this.
[time=2092] You with me?
[time=2093] Just kind of just go.
[time=2094] Malachi's, Hagiai, Ozeia, Daniel, Ezekiel, lamentation, Jeremiah is a proverb.
[time=2105] Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
[time=2106] You just keep going.
[time=2107] Just sit there, look at your Bible, hold it in your hands and then just go back from Malachi.
[time=2112] Just keep flipping kings and first kings and Samuel.
[time=2116] For keep going Joshua, now we're back to the Torah.
[time=2119] You with me?
[time=2119] Genesis to Malachi.
[time=2124] Age 10 to 14, word for word, concept for concept.
[time=2130] And this was a grueling, extremely demanding process
[time=2140] at the conclusion of which, boy this is where it gets even more interesting, at the conclusion of which.
[time=2149] And even larger number of young boys and at this point, all girls.
[time=2153] At this point, an even larger number of young boys and now at this point, all the young girls would be sent home to now again learn the family trade and begin apprenticing with their family.
[time=2167] If their family was into construction, they began to learn how to build.
[time=2171] If their family was into fishing, they began to learn how to fish.
[time=2174] If their family was into agriculture and crops, they began to learn how to plant them because although they were good kids and they obviously loved God and they had a respect for his scriptures, the rabbis who had spent the time with them, would look at them and there would be something in that rabbi that would look at that boy or a girl and say, I don't think they have what it takes to really, really become what down deep in our hearts.
[time=2202] We really want them to become that being a disciple and so they would be sent home.
[time=2207] Interesting note there.
[time=2210] When we talked about this three years ago, the reason we were talking about it, it was at Christmas time and we were studying Mary's, the Virgin Mary, mother of our Lord, we were studying her, the Mary's Magnificat, that unbelievable response that Mary has.
[time=2228] You can look there sometime in Luke 1.
[time=2230] I mean, look at it again today.
[time=2232] When we touched on this back then, when you look at Mary's Magnificat, when you look at the response of Mary in those, I forget how many verses that thing takes up, that response of Mary, Mary, the probably the 14, 15, 16-year-old.
[time=2247] The response of Mary when you read in Luke 1 is all the whole response is quoting the Old Testament.
[time=2258] The whole response is just verse after verse of her intertwining passages and great truths from the Proverbs and from the Psalms and from the Torah and from the Proverbs, just an amazing indication of how much she understood and knew and how do you think she understood and knew all of that?
[time=2279] Because she was a young lady who had been through this process and yet at this point now, at the end of Beit Talmud, many of them, many of the boys and all the girls are sent home.
[time=2290] And I want you just to stop and think about that for a moment.
[time=2293] Remember what I told you earlier.
[time=2295] Remember about the culture.
[time=2296] Remember about what every young boy wanted to be.
[time=2298] All they ever wanted to be was a rabbised disciple.
[time=2302] And yet at this point, most of them were, let's just use the phrase, cut.
[time=2308] You ever been cut?
[time=2314] You ever been in a situation where you didn't make the team?
[time=2319] Ever been in a situation where you just weren't good enough?
[time=2325] Maybe it was for you growing up.
[time=2328] Maybe for you, it's still today.
[time=2329] I don't know.
[time=2331] Anybody here in the room identify with that feeling that some must have had at this point, that feeling of they're always just somebody a little bit better than you.
[time=2341] There's always, there just always seemed to be somebody a little bit smarter than you.
[time=2345] There was always somebody a little bit cuter than you.
[time=2347] There's always somebody who just seems to have it a little bit better than you have it.
[time=2352] You know, do you know today, as you said here, what it's like to have that feeling of not being good enough, being told to go home, being told that in essence, you won't ever really live up to what maybe you had deep in your heart hoped you would live up to.
[time=2371] See, the only ones who made the team were the best of the best, the cream of the crop, the remarkably gifted, the incredibly bright, the ones with great potential.
[time=2385] Can you hear them?
[time=2386] Can you hear them saying it to them?
[time=2388] We believe you have great potential.
[time=2391] You, you go home and plant crops.
[time=2394] And the ones that were good enough, the ones with the great potential, they would now enter into a phase of the disciple-making process known as bait midrash.
[time=2405] You can write that down, bait midrash and in bait midrash, the young man would literally watch how this works.
[time=2412] In bait midrash, now it becomes very personal and now it becomes very deliberate.
[time=2417] The young man would literally apply, like fill out an application for a certain rabbi.
[time=2424] Young men would now apply to be with and part of a certain rabbi's posse, I don't know what they call it, but you know what I'm saying.
[time=2433] And the rabbi would sit the young man down
[time=2440] and this young man would sit there with the rabbi with the hopes of that rabbi possibly, hopefully choosing him to be one of his, what, say it out loud, disciples.
[time=2456] And it's really important that we understand something at this point.
[time=2459] Most of the time we think of disciples as learners and students and followers, but a Jewish young man didn't just wanna know what a rabbi knew.
[time=2467] He wanted to be like that rabbi.
[time=2471] He wanted to, don't miss this, he wanted to do what that rabbi did.
[time=2479] He wanted to become just like him.
[time=2487] This is where the concept of yolks comes into this discussion.
[time=2492] You're saying, wait, you just started talking about eggs?
[time=2494] No.
[time=2496] Some of you understand yolks, others of you may not.
[time=2498] Let me just help you with that.
[time=2500] A yoke, in fact, I think maybe a lot of you in the room can remember a passage where Jesus talked about his yoke being what, do you remember?
[time=2510] Easy, yeah, not over, easy, just easy.
[time=2516] Just seeing if you're with me.
[time=2517] Yolks, watch this.
[time=2520] Yolks were, see all the, there were a lot of rabbis.
[time=2524] There were many rabbis, and the rabbis would travel around to the synagogues and they would teach and they would communicate truth about the Torah and the scriptures and Jehovah.
[time=2535] And all the rabbis kind of had their own personal bent, their own personal interpretation, their own kind of personal translation of how all that should be worked out and what all that should sound like and look like.
[time=2550] And so a rabbis specific set of teachings or interpretations would come to be known as that rabbi's yoke.
[time=2559] And so when the young man would apply to the rabbi, the rabbi would grill him with all kinds of questions about his yoke because he wanted this young man to be able to be one who could represent his yoke.
[time=2574] He wanted that young man to be one who knew everything there was to know about his yoke.
[time=2581] And their yokes were huge, their yokes were complicated, their yokes were tremendously, they were voluminous, they were just massive and these boys, they got grilled to the cows came home and they got asked questions and they got put on the hot seat because that rabbi wanted to know if down deep inside that boy had what it took to actually be a disciple and watch this, this is so cool.
[time=2608] I just sat there in my office this week, I'm digging through and I'm reading and I'm discovering this stuff all over again and I come to this and it was just one of those, whoa, it was one of those, you gotta be kidding me moments.
[time=2619] Tradition, this is like Jewish tradition, you know,
[time=2626] it's like in the books, it's like what, it's just known, this is what would happen at the end of Bateman Rash if that young man had what it took.
[time=2635] The concluding statement that rabbi, whoever he was, would make, if he felt like the kid had what it took to come and be one of his disciples, the rabbi would look the young man in the eye and say to him, come, follow me, they would say that.
[time=2659] Every young boy in that culture grew up hoping and dreaming, that one day a rabbi would look him in the eye
[time=2678] and say, come, what, follow me.
[time=2687] Well, when the rabbi would say to the young man, you're in, come, follow me.
[time=2693] Here's the other like unbelievable, cool thing that I learned again, looking at this stuff in recent days, when he would say, come, follow me, guess what that young boy would do.
[time=2702] What do you think he'd do, follow him?
[time=2707] When do you think he would follow him?
[time=2709] Would he say to that rabbi, let me chew on it for a little bit.
[time=2715] Do you think that young boy in that culture with all those dreams and hopes?
[time=2718] Do you think he would say, let me chew on it?
[time=2720] Let me go talk to my folks about it.
[time=2722] You know what, I'm gonna talk to my friends and I'll get back to you, rabbi dude.
[time=2726] Anybody in the room think a young boy in that culture with that kind of a backdrop would say that.
[time=2733] Anybody?
[time=2735] No, no, no, no, no.
[time=2736] Again, history tells us, tradition, it's just right there, I was just reading it.
[time=2740] History tells us that that young boy would leave immediately.
[time=2745] Sound familiar?
[time=2748] He would drop everything and he would go and he would follow that rabbi.
[time=2754] He would leave his family, he would leave his friends, he would leave his village, he would devote the rest of his life from that point in time forward.
[time=2764] The moment he heard the words, come, follow me.
[time=2766] Everything would be devoted for the rest of his life to being like that rabbi.
[time=2772] The rest of his life to doing what that rabbi did.
[time=2776] Now, on this side, on that side of that discussion
[time=2783] in terms of the historical backdrop, in terms of how those rabbis, all of them did what they did, that's how that happened, that's the motivation and the commitment level.
[time=2794] The first thing I wanted to show you, and it also answers the second thing I wanted to talk about was who got to be one?
[time=2799] Who got to be one?
[time=2800] You all just saw the process.
[time=2802] Who got to be one, the ones who got to be disciples were the best of the best, the cream of the crop, top of the heap, most gifted, most talented, most capacity, greatest potential, unbelievably sharp, bright, talented young men.
[time=2819] Well, who got to be one in Jesus' program?
[time=2826] I wanna show you this, this is equally amazing.
[time=2831] Who got to be a disciple?
[time=2833] Interesting, historical, no, you might wanna just write this down.
[time=2836] Again, historically, what you learn as you study rabbinic tradition and the Jewish faith, rabbis in that day would begin their public ministry.
[time=2846] Rabbis in that day, having gone through their training
[time=2854] and their preparation in that culture, rabbis would begin the process of traveling from synagogue to synagogue at the age of, anybody wanna take a guess?
[time=2864] Say it loud, 30.
[time=2866] 30 is when, by virtue of rabbinic tradition, rabbis began to do their thing.
[time=2873] And guess who shows up as a rabbi at 30 to begin his public ministry?
[time=2882] His name was Jesus.
[time=2886] All right, I've been waiting all morning for this.
[time=2889] It really have.
[time=2891] And I know this just might be me, okay?
[time=2894] Realize, sometimes I walk up here knowing I'm a little bit more jacked up on this stuff than you are.
[time=2900] I've been thinking about it all week.
[time=2902] I've been all week long, I've been waiting for this moment.
[time=2905] So I hate to like overdo it because it may incredibly disappoint you.
[time=2908] But to me, I mean, first hour I hardly got through it because to me, this is the great beauty of studying the Bible.
[time=2915] Because I'm about to read to you some verses that are great verses that many of us have read our entire lives.
[time=2922] But I wonder, I wonder if maybe now that we have the backdrop that we have this morning.
[time=2929] I wonder if having studied the context of that culture and that day, I wonder if knowing what you now know about how these boys were raised and what they used to think about and what they used to dream of.
[time=2943] I wonder how hearing these verses that I'm about to read to you, I wonder how it's gonna impact you.
[time=2950] We'll see.
[time=2952] You ready?
[time=2953] Mark one, 16.
[time=2955] Mark one, 16 through 20.
[time=2960] I got goosebumps, I'm sorry, I'll be quiet.
[time=2962] As he was going along, Jesus now, okay?
[time=2966] As he was going along by the sea of Galilee, at the age of 30, he's stepping onto the scene.
[time=2972] He saw Simon and Andrew, Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea for they were, everybody say it out loud, they were fishing.
[time=2987] These young men, they were fishermen.
[time=2992] And Jesus said to them, and Jesus said to them,
[time=2998] follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.
[time=3003] A rabbi says to them, as they're fishing,
[time=3011] follow me, I'll keep going.
[time=3018] Going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat, mending the nets, which meant they were what?
[time=3031] Fishermen, in the boat, mending nets.
[time=3034] Immediately, he called to them, implied, come, follow me, and they left their father's Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went away to what?
[time=3044] Say it out loud.
[time=3045] Some of you know this, you've already heard it and you've studied it yourself for others of you though.
[time=3053] Let me just try to be as clear as possible and just allow you to see this in the context of all we've just learned.
[time=3059] They were Jewish young men and they were fishing.
[time=3065] If they were fishing, then they weren't following
[time=3071] another rabbi.
[time=3072] If they were fishing, it meant they weren't following another rabbi, and they weren't following another rabbi because they were fishing.
[time=3080] And if they were fishing, it meant that somewhere at some point in time, they had been deemed not good enough.
[time=3087] At some point in time, they had been cut.
[time=3094] At some point in time, a rabbi had looked them in the eye and said, I'm sorry, Simon, you're a good kid, but you do not have what it takes to be a disciple.
[time=3104] Go home and learn the family trade.
[time=3107] And Jesus comes along and he calls out to them
[time=3113] in the midst of them doing their job, come follow me, and they drop their nets and they follow him when, immediately.
[time=3121] Can you imagine what that must have been like for them?
[time=3133] for them having grown up the way they'd grown up and having heard all that they had heard and having been taught, all that they had been taught?
[time=3142] And I think there's enormous application, my friends, in that scenario right there, more than we can even get to this morning.
[time=3148] But let me just say this, Jesus chooses them and I wanna make sure you understand this.
[time=3152] Jesus chooses them because his movement is for who?
[time=3156] Jesus' movement is for all.
[time=3160] Jesus' movement is for the not good enough.
[time=3163] Jesus' movement, the kingdom that he's about to lead, the progress that he's about to make, it's for those who didn't make the cut.
[time=3170] It's for especially those who weren't the best of the best.
[time=3173] Jesus' movement was for men and women.
[time=3176] His movement was for the poor and the rich.
[time=3178] His movement was for the educated and the uneducated, the red, the yellow, the brown, the black, the white.
[time=3185] His movement was for everyone who would follow after him.
[time=3190] And I wrote a couple things down here.
[time=3198] And I just want you to think about 'em.
[time=3200] And then we're gonna sing and we're gonna get out of here.
[time=3204] But bear with me here.
[time=3205] In light of everything that we've said this morning, there are a number of things that just immediately come to the forefront of my mind.
[time=3215] First of all is this, when you stop and think, my friends, about the level of investment that was made in those children in that day.
[time=3224] When you think about the capacity of a six-year-old to a 14-year-old, when you think about what they were actually able to do, when you think about the values that were deposited into them by those who led them and guided them and taught them.
[time=3240] When you think about the life of a six-year-old to a 14-year-old, and you look at your six-year-olds and I look at my 14-year-olds, when we think about the disciplines that our kids are pursuing.
[time=3256] When you and I think about the kind of investment that we're willing to make and the level of work we're actually willing to give, and you look at these kids, I have to just stand here in front of you this morning and say, I've felt convicted.
[time=3270] I've been reminded of the capacity
[time=3277] that a young boy and a young girl has if given the right kind of guidance and if given the right kind of opportunity, and if led properly and strongly and carefully and with great sensitivity by a mom or a dad, I think there's an enormous amount that our kids can experience that they're not today because they're not that disciplined because we don't ask that of them.
[time=3302] Another thing I wrote down was James and John.
[time=3308] I wanna have you turn to Luke 14.
[time=3309] I'm gonna have Brendan come on up if he would and I'm gonna ask Natasha and Doug to come on up and as they're coming up, I want you to look at Luke 14 26 to 28.
[time=3320] I took you here last week.
[time=3323] I wanna just show this to you, my friends.
[time=3324] I'm gonna just keep showing this stuff to you.
[time=3326] Luke 14 26 to 28.
[time=3329] Last week we saw the cost of discipleship.
[time=3332] Last week I showed you.
[time=3333] Jesus is very words about the cost, the kind of and the level of commitment that you and I in our effort to follow after him, there are some decisions that we'll have to make.
[time=3347] Luke 14 20, now the rabbi and the large crowds were going along with him and he turned and said to them, verse 26, "If anyone comes to me "and does not hate his own what," say it out loud.
[time=3358] Father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, even his own life.
[time=3364] He cannot be my what, say it.
[time=3367] Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which one of you when he wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it.
[time=3383] Jesus didn't say don't love your mom.
[time=3386] Jesus wasn't saying don't love your dad.
[time=3388] Jesus wasn't saying hate your family completely.
[time=3391] He was saying love me and be willing to follow me more than anything.
[time=3398] James and John leave Zebedee in the boat.
[time=3401] Interesting, studying this week, it said hired servants were in the boat, which would indicate that Zebedee's fishing business was kick and tail.
[time=3411] He was making some, he was doing well.
[time=3415] So they leave a lucrative family fishing enterprise.
[time=3418] They drop everything because a rabbi said, come follow me.
[time=3422] The rabbi, listen, the rabbi, Jesus, uses the phrase, come follow me 17 times in the gospel accounts.
[time=3431] And in doing so, not only did he communicate to those in his day, but he leaves for you and for me a very clear, very powerful invitation.
[time=3440] He knew those young men had spent their entire lives hoping that one day they could follow someone who would bring divine meaning and purpose to their life.
[time=3452] And he knows today that you and I long for that very same thing.
[time=3458] You and I long to be engaged in something that's beyond us.
[time=3463] You and I long to be a part of something that is transcendent.
[time=3467] And he says to you and me today, you wanna do that, come follow me.
[time=3473] And so in these next few weeks, you and I will have the opportunity to count those costs and consider that kind of commitment.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
