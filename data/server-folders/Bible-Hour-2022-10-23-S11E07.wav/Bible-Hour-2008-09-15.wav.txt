[time=261] (upbeat music) - Well hello everybody, welcome again to the broadcast.
[time=266] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving as senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I am thankful to be a part of this Bible Hour team.
[time=275] I've told you before, we're so grateful that we have this opportunity to bring you week after week, this broadcast, it means a great deal to us, and the reason it means so much to us is the things we hear from you, the things we see God doing, the encouragement that we receive when we bump into you, when we get letters from you, when you send us your emails.
[time=297] I was just last night at a gym watching my son play basketball, just sitting there kind of by myself, and just a very kind family who came up and the wife spoke with me, and she said that for years, every Sunday, she's watched the Bible Hour, and that a friend of hers, maybe even her sister, the two of them, they both watch it independently of each other and every Monday, they get together and compare notes, and God uses that time to encourage them, God uses that time to prepare them for their week, and it just meant the world to me, and it reminded me again that periodically there is a team of people here at Blackhawk who give themselves each and every week to this broadcast, and periodically it's great for them to get to hear from you, and so I want to invite you if you would this week, really just if you'd take a minute, would you do that, would you take just a minute or two, go to your computer, maybe send us an email, you can find our email address at our website, you can send it directly to me if you'd like, my email address is right here at the bottom of your screen, and anything that you write to me about the Bible Hour and its impact in your life, anything you'd like to share with us about what God's doing in you as he grows you in your faith, or as he draws you closer and closer to faith, either way we would be absolutely encouraged and really thrilled to get to hear from you, so do that yourself if you know of others who appreciate and enjoy this broadcast, encourage them to write in, we'd love to hear from you in the next couple of weeks, and I'd love to take all of those notes and share them with our team, it'll mean a lot to them.
[time=403] Hey, thank you for tuning in today, we continue in today's message in our elemental series, and we get to the first element actually in this series, "Praerful Abiding", "Praerful Abiding", a very, very important concept for you and I as disciples, followers of Christ to understand, so I hope you'll open your heart and I hope you'll open your mind to what God will have for you today.
[time=427] Thank you so much for being a part of the Blackhawk family, thank you for tuning in, and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=449] [MUSIC]
[time=479] He has asked that we give with an attitude of joy.
[time=483] It is a chance to rejoice in a life rich with blessing, and at the same time recognize the generosity of our Creator. It is an opportunity to let go of something dear to us in an active worship to the one who generously provides for all of our needs. In doing this, our gift becomes much more than our money.
[time=503] It becomes a contribution to the heart of Christ.
[time=509] [MUSIC - 4 seconds]
[time=517] You are the source
[time=523] of life I can't be left behind no one else will do.
[time=535] [MUSIC]
[time=539] I will take hold of you [MUSIC - 280 seconds]
[time=827] [APPLAUSE]
[time=831] Hey, as Chris plays, just think for a moment, I don't know when it was, that you were rescued. I don't know when it was, that
[time=841] you sensed God's redeeming hand in your life, as he reached out to pull you out of
[time=847] whatever it is you were in. It was sin.
[time=851] It was that way for all of us, but it may have been years ago, it may have been just recently. And then even having been redeemed, you know, having been saved, there are times when
[time=861] he rescues us again, you know, because you and I, even though we know better at times, we get ourselves into spots. And so if you're here this morning and you've been rescued, if you're here this morning and you know what it's like to have been saved, say amen. Amen. It's a great, great song.
[time=877] I'm so thankful for our team and the work they do. Thank you, Chris.
[time=881] Thank you for family to you, for lifting your voices, and what a great beginning. Let's dive back in to our discussion. Can we do that? We have started a series that we have entitled Elemental, God's Design for the Life of a Disciple.
[time=901] And I asked you last week, I encouraged you to be willing to get familiar with that term again. Disciple.
[time=909] I had you say it a few times. Go ahead and say it again.
[time=913] Disciple. I tell you what, if you're a, if you're a man or a woman, a young man or a young lady, a boy or a girl in this room, if you're somebody who has fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ by virtue of what God's word says, you are a disciple. You are one who is seeking to imitate Jesus. You are wanting to be an individual who follows after the Son of God, and that's what's known as a disciple. And as our leadership, our elders and staff over the last year, and a half have studied God's Word. And as we've come together prayerfully and thoughtfully and looked specifically at the Gospels and the Book of Acts and even on into the Epistles, we've seen that there are some patterns. Those that followed after the Son of God. Those that imitated Him.
[time=961] And the Son of God Himself, Jesus Christ, as we looked at His life, there were some disciplines, there were some elemental pursuits that we find there that we just have to do our very best with His help. We want to pass those along to you in these weeks that will follow. Elements, you know, we talked, we gave you a little chemistry lesson a few weeks ago. The substance that we're after is a disciple. And disciples, when you look at the Scriptures, there are clearly some elements that go into a true and genuine disciple. And we want you to see those elements, prayerful abiding and a commitment to the Scripture and missional serving and transformational community and a commitment to make other disciples as well. Five elements and we begin today as we jump into that first element of prayerful abiding.
[time=1013] But before we do that, I want to pass along a couple things to you that I thought were really really exciting. First of all, I've got to note this week that there's a high school gal in our family here who seems to have gone a bit elemental. She has come up with or actually she didn't come up with it. God put it on her heart, which is so encouraging to see young people being willing to respond like this. This gal and I think she's going to have some others helping her. She felt God calling her to have a car wash today at the ridders, right down here on state from one to five. And this young lamb, and I'm just reading here, this young gal will be putting the money that is earned from the car wash to buying, to purchasing Bibles for local churches and ministries that cannot afford to purchase Bibles for their congregations and outreach ministries. How cool is that?
[time=1065] Along with the purchasing of Bibles, she's going to take 10% of whatever they earn and put it towards supporting students who are under resourced and want to go to fall blast.
[time=1077] It's the high school ministry's big fall getaway. She wants to make sure kids who couldn't afford to go can go. So 10% of all that's raised today is going to go toward helping under resourced students get to fall blast. And they're going to be washing cars from one to five at ridders. So I'm just encouraging you to take your clean car, your dirty car, whatever car you can take, take it twice. But head down to ridders between one and five and let these kids, let these kids wash their cars. Isn't that encouraging? That was great to hear.
[time=1109] Also, it's very cool. There will be also, there's a new, we've got, we're blessed to have a number, several Sunday morning, first hour and second hour. There are Sunday morning classes that any adult can be a part of. These are great opportunities for people to connect classes that are a home for folks of all ages and all stages of life. I'm so thankful for those classes. There's a new one, a new Sunday morning community that will be starting next Sunday morning the 28th. Listen to this. I think this is a great idea. Starting September 28th during the first hour, during first service, starting next week, 9 a.m., over in the north campus across the street room 126. There will be a new Sunday morning community that is open to any adult, any adult. Single, married, younger, older, doesn't matter who you are.
[time=1161] If you're looking for an opportunity to connect with others in a smaller setting and learn more about incorporating the elemental series, this teaching that we're in on these five elements, this Sunday morning community is going to be given in its early stages to helping people bring application to those truths, to their very own lives. And I couldn't think of a better way to do that than to do that with others. And so I want to just encourage anybody. If you don't have a place to connect, you need to.
[time=1193] This isn't enough. There has got to be a smaller setting of some kind in your life where you live life with others and you're able to continue to flesh out the truth that we touch upon in this setting. And I want to just encourage you to think about that. Next Sunday morning the 28th North Campus Room 126. Okay.
[time=1213] Elemental. God's designed for the life of a disciple. We jump in this morning with the first one, prayerful abiding.
[time=1221] Three things though before we do that. Three things I want to make sure you hear me say. Number one, somebody asked me this week if elemental is Black Hawk's newest program. And they asked it very honestly and they asked it very sincerely. They wanted to know if this was kind of the new thing we're doing.
[time=1237] And I understood the question because oftentimes you know church leaders go away to conferences and come back with great new ideas. And before you know it, your church is doing it because he saw it somewhere else and thought it'd be great for your church.
[time=1249] And I want to make sure all of you understand that this is not a new program.
[time=1253] If you want to use the word program, this is actually a very very old program. This is an ancient program that we're simply revisiting. And I want to just show you, if I can, where we got this program, this elemental idea. I want to just show you an example of where we came up with this. We actually didn't. God did and he birthed it in his very first church. Would you turn to Acts chapter 2? Acts chapter 2, verse 41. Let me show you where we got this elemental idea and why it is. We're so excited about this.
[time=1289] It says in Acts 2, 41, so then those who had received his word were baptized and that day they were added another 3,000 souls. This is what is going on in the very first days of the very first church that God ever birthed. 3,000 souls coming to faith in Christ.
[time=1309] They were, verse 42 says, continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching. If you listen closely, my friends, you'll see very easily the five elements just jumping off the page as we read through this. It says they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles and all those who had believed were together and had all things in common and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all as anyone might have need and they were even doing car washes.
[time=1353] It's incredible what goes on when these things are in play day by day, verse 46, continuing with one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart, praising God and having favor or finding favor with all the people and the Lord was adding to their number. People were being saved, the church was growing. God was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
[time=1389] My friends, that's the program that we're interested in. That's the model that we want to follow after. And I want to just remind you, I don't think I have to, but that right, what I just read to you right there, that place, those people, that church was filled with disciples.
[time=1413] That place was filled with those who were imitating Jesus. I mean, in many respects, many of those folks had been with him.
[time=1421] Very imitation was one that had come from an up close and personal exposure to the Son of God himself. That church and those endeavors and what you see there, in those words, that was a place filled with disciples.
[time=1437] And we want to be a place and a people. We want this to be a ministry filled with, not attenders and not few sitters and not folks who are part of a deal, but priests, disciples, those willing to be part of a revolutionary force. And we're going to do our very best in the days to come to help you understand these five elemental pursuits and disciplines. Secondly, I want you to write this down before we start.
[time=1466] Write down, and again, my apologies for not being a note sheet this week. I know many of you enjoy that.
[time=1472] We'll get back to that next week, but just let me, I'll give you a few things as we go through the morning to write down. I want you to write this down. Write down the words pattern and then next to pattern, just write the word example.
[time=1484] A couple of words that came up in my study in recent weeks, I think this is a good place to insert this again, just to continue to set the stage for what it is we're trying to pursue here. Pattern. Let me talk to you about this for a moment. Our belief is this. Somebody shared this with me a few weeks ago. I thought it was very pertinent. Our belief is this, that the disciples and all the other early believers along with them tried their very best to pattern their lives after the things they saw Jesus do and teach. In Acts chapter 1, and you can write that down, in Acts chapter 1, Luke writes that in his first book, most of you know this, some of you don't, but the first book Luke wrote, Luke wrote the book of Acts, but his first book was the gospel of Luke. And in Acts chapter 1, verse 1, Luke writes that his first book, the gospel of Luke, was about all the things that Jesus began to do and teach. And the inference is that as time went by, the Lord in essence continued to do and teach these things through the Acts of the Apostles and the early believers as they patterned, there's that word, as they patterned their life after and the power of the Holy Spirit. A few examples of this, write this down, Acts chapter 3. Would you do that? Acts chapter 3, here's an example of early believers patterning themselves.
[time=1568] Peter, in Acts 3, heals a cripple. You can read about it, it's an amazing story. Peter heals one who was crippled and it's amazing as Peter heals the cripple, he says, stand up and he says, stand up and walk. And Peter says, stand up and walk because just a year and a half, two years before, he had seen probably more than once, who had he seen do that very thing, whom had he watched, heal crippled people, and whom had he listened to, say to them, stand up and walk.
[time=1600] Peter had watched his Lord do that. Peter patterning himself after his Lord. Later in Acts, as Stephen, many of you know this story, as Stephen has dragged out of Jerusalem and stoned to death, beaten by an angry mob, as he breathes his last breath, as Stephen lays there under this pile of rocks that have been thrown on him, as he's getting ready to die. Stephen, when this last breath says, oh God, forgive them. Patterning the forgiving spirit of one right near death, patterning the very words of his Lord, who did the very same thing.
[time=1640] Please write this down. A disciple is one who patterns his or her entire life after the things Jesus did and taught. A disciple is one who patterns his or her entire life after the things Jesus did and taught. Another word for pattern in the New Testament, my friends, is the word example. And I think you already wrote that word down.
[time=1664] Another word for pattern is example. Look at 1 Peter 2.21.
[time=1668] 1 Peter 2.21, several places in the New Testament where we could go and see this word used. I want you to see it here in this context. For you, it says 1 Peter 2.21, for you have been called for this purpose. Peter writing to a church who was under great persecution. He says, you have been called for this purpose since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example. This word example is a very, very powerful word and I want to just give you a brief insight
[time=1698] on its meaning in the original language. In the Greek, it referred to, watch this, this is so cool.
[time=1704] It referred to a symbol of the word of the word of the word of the word.
[time=1712] This is a very, very powerful word and I want to just give you a brief insight on its meaning in the original language. In the Greek, it referred to, watch this, this is so cool.
[time=1720] A symbol, or some insignia, or some raised writing.
[time=1728] And the word example is the word used for tracing.
[time=1732] And we did it as kids and your kids do it, my kids do it.
[time=1736] It's the idea of taking a thin piece of paper and putting it over that object.
[time=1744] And that object is Christ. That object is Jesus. And we take this thin piece of paper and we put it over Jesus. And we take our pencil and we draw that picture.
[time=1760] We draw that shape. And because we're tracing something that's there, you remember, as a kid, right? I mean, we would draw pictures and they looked horrible and then we wanted to impress somebody so we'd go and do what?
[time=1772] We'd trace it and we'd trace it and we'd go to our friends and say look at my tree and they'd go yeah, right? You trace that.
[time=1780] And why would they know that you traced it? They know you traced it because it was such a good drawing. It was a replica, right?
[time=1788] And that's that word. He says that we are to be replicas. Not like shady, like bad pictures, like really, really good pictures. Like almost like just like right there because we just trace. We just lay ourselves down over him. And what he did, we try and do. And what he taught, we try to understand in the way he valued, we do the same. This is the idea, my friends, of a disciple. Third thing, and we'll jump in.
[time=1820] Third thing I want you to know is we cannot continue this discussion without mentioning the fact that this entire endeavor that we're about to jump into, what we've already jumped into it. But we can't go any further down this road without acknowledging the fact that there is no way we can make any progress toward the five elements and the discipline of those five elements and the pursuit of those five elements without the involvement of the Holy Spirit in that endeavor. It just won't happen. You know what?
[time=1852] I could, well, you know what you could, honestly.
[time=1856] I could rent a Tiger Woods instructional DVD video thing. Any of us could sit down. And if we wanted to copy Tiger Woods swing, and I know some of you are thinking well, I'm not a great athletic. But you know what? If you watched it, week after week after week after week and month after month after month after month if we just sat down and watched that thing and over time just kept practicing and practicing and practicing. I'll tell you what, you give it a year, we'll put you on tape. You could get really close to replicating Tiger Woods golf swing. Really, really close.
[time=1892] In and of yourself, your own effort, your own discipline. You and I can give ourselves to this endeavor all we want. We can try and practice this and do these things all we want. We will never come close to prayerful abiding and a commitment to God's word and missional serving and transformational community and making that we will never come close to these five things without the help and guidance and strength and leadership of the Holy Spirit in your life and mind in this process. I want you to know that and I want to pray that for you right now as we jump in. Let me read this before we pray. Look at this great passage in John 14. Now Jesus talking about this very thing. Jesus says, in John 14 15, if you love me, disciples, if you love me, you will keep my commandments. Huge task, great opportunity.
[time=1952] If you love me, you'll keep my commandments. So I will ask the father and he will give you another helper that he may be with you for how long?
[time=1964] Forever. And it says in 17, "That is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it does not see him or know him but you know him because you know me." Jesus is saying. "But you know him because he abides with you and will be in you." Pray with me. Would you father God as we jump in here this morning?
[time=1988] We would ask that very thing that you would send your helper.
[time=1992] We know that you did when we came to know you personally. We know that you gave us your spirit but oh God we want to make sure that we would be out of the way completely, absolutely yielded and submissive to whatever leading, whatever conviction, whatever he may want to do in us as we begin to think about our pursuit of these five elements.
[time=2016] God we love you. We thank you for the helper. We thank you for the spirit of God and the word of God and we pray this morning that they would do their work in us. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=2028] All right, element number one prayerful of biting.
[time=2032] Couple of definitions for you and by definition I mean I want to just give you definitions for those two words and I think as we define those two words I think it gives us a great, great start and some very practical understanding into what we're talking about and what we mean by the fact that disciples, followers of Christ, Jesus, imitators, they are people who are given deeply devoted to prayerful abiding because their Lord was. Let me show you. To be in communication with God prayerful. What does it mean to pray?
[time=2068] Many of you think this is a very tricky thing. Many of you think this might be a very complicated definition. Let me just put your minds at ease. To pray is to be in communication with God.
[time=2080] To be willing to share with God, speak to God, talk to God those things on your heart, those feelings that you have, those questions that haunt you, those desires that you want to make known to him, the confession that Corbin let us in early. Communicating with God is to be prayerful. To communicate with God in act, and we'll talk about this, in act and in attitude.
[time=2104] Very important and again we'll make that distinction later.
[time=2108] Abiding. Okay, prayerful abiding. What does it mean to abide? This my friends is a very, very powerful word. It is a very, very powerful concept. I hope you'll write some of this down.
[time=2120] Abide. To abide means to remain and listen to the definition.
[time=2124] The definition brings some very clear implications.
[time=2128] It means to remain.
[time=2132] Abiding is to stay in.
[time=2136] Abiding is to not depart from. To be fixed and connected. Did you get that?
[time=2144] When the Scriptures talk about abiding, when we talk about it here in the context of this discussion, we're talking about someone who doesn't leave. We're talking about someone who doesn't depart. We're talking about someone who doesn't back away, but instead someone who stays fixed, someone who settles in, someone who remains, who is connected.
[time=2168] Interesting, sad, kind of funny, all at the same time story.
[time=2172] I told you last winter about our dog, Laker.
[time=2176] We love Laker at our home. Laker fell under jumped into the pond. You'll remember it was iced over. She went through the ice, came up where there was no place to come up.
[time=2188] It was a very sad story. The long and short of it was that we almost lost her. She eventually made her way to the shore. My wife did a little CPR. She actually might sound kind of gross. She didn't do CPR.
[time=2200] Like mouth to mouth. It was just the pumping on the chest, the water coming out. Don't get confused there.
[time=2208] The kids and my wife Laker on the shore pounding on the dog's chest. All the water comes back out. She ends up at the vet hospital for a week. They like a couple times she was almost dead and they kind of brought her back. So seven days later she was home and we're thrilled. The fact of the matter is about six months later we're pretty sure she's like maybe half brain dead. She gets along fine. I've watched her walk into walls to be honest with you.
[time=2236] She eats great. She plays with the kids. It's really not a big deal but she's just not all there but I'll tell you this. Even though she might not all be there, she recovered from all of that in a kennel.
[time=2248] We went to see her at the hospital a couple times.
[time=2252] She recovered from all of that in a kennel. That's where they treat dogs and there's a lot of dogs there and other animals. They keep them in these kennels and she recovered from all of that in a kennel. We've got a kennel in our mud room right there near the garage.
[time=2268] Our dogs are outside dogs. They get in every once in a while into that mud room. That's about it. But I'll tell you what, ever since that day if that dog sees a crack in that door and if it's kabra or any of the kids, she will literally just bulldoze them. She will run full steam ahead and run them over to get past them into that house, quick right hand turn into the mud room and into that kennel. It's just the most amazing thing and she gets into that kennel and she burrows into the back of that thing and she plants herself in that kennel and you just try. You try and go in there. I've watched kids try. I've watched my wife try. I've taken a crack at it a few times.
[time=2312] You can drag her by her nose. She will not get out of that kennel. She is stuck to that thing. She wants to be in that thing. She finds comfort in that thing and she abides.
[time=2324] You with me? She abides.
[time=2328] She is abiding in that kennel.
[time=2332] Connected, fixed. Doesn't want to depart.
[time=2336] And that's exactly what the word means. I am not leaving this place.
[time=2344] Prayerful abiding, put the two definitions together, an intimacy with God that is fostered and furthered by the act and attitude of prayer. It really is a great phrase to take all of that and just bring it together.
[time=2360] Intimacy, it is being in an intimate place with God and refusing to be disconnected. An intimacy with God that is fostered and furthered by the act and attitude of prayer. And all how prayer can foster that and further that intimacy with him.
[time=2380] So, if as we learned last week, our calling as disciples is to come follow Jesus if imitating the Lord is the substance needed for a fruitful, anointed, and powerful church, then to this point of prayerful abiding, here's the question I want you to ask this morning.
[time=2400] What kind of pattern, and that's a word we've used already today, what kind of pattern did Jesus establish?
[time=2408] What kind of pattern did Jesus leave for us to trace over when it comes to this issue of abiding with the Father? What pattern did the Lord establish for us to follow after regarding intimacy with God?
[time=2424] This idea of abiding. Well, go to Matthew 14. Let me just give you, and I mean this, let me give you a shortened, I'll give you the short version of this.
[time=2436] It's a really, really amazing thing to see. I want you to watch as we read through this, and I just want you to see for yourself Jesus and his own approach to this idea of prayer, Jesus and this approach, this commitment he had to abiding being with and not wanting to depart from the Father, look for yourself at the example, the pattern Jesus leaves us. Look at Matthew 14, Matthew 14, 23. We'll start in 22. Sorry, that's Mark.
[time=2472] I'm just, I'm too proud to go down there and get my glasses that I left on the front row.
[time=2480] Sorry, 14, 23.
[time=2484] It says, immediately 22 is immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side while he sent the crowds away. After verse 23, after Jesus had sent the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to what? Say it out loud.
[time=2504] And when it was evening, he was there what?
[time=2508] Say it alone.
[time=2512] Go to Luke. Jesus, going up away from the crowds to the mountain to pray, to be with God the Father alone. Go to Luke 5.
[time=2524] Go to Luke 5. And aren't I glad there are no more books in the Gospels that start with L. It's just Luke.
[time=2532] I can see it right there. It's an L.
[time=2536] Luke 5, 16. Seriously, it's okay. I was just kidding.
[time=2540] Thank you, Dean. Gosh, I hate this.
[time=2544] All right. How you doing?
[time=2548] Luke 5, 16. Watch this pattern.
[time=2552] It says, but Jesus himself, it says, look at 15. And I hope you're turning here as we go. I want you to read this for yourself. Look at 15. But the news about him was spreading even farther. And large crowds were gathering to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. But Jesus himself would, what's it say? Often. But Jesus himself would often slip away to the what?
[time=2580] Say it. Wilderness. And do what? Pray.
[time=2584] Yeah. Luke 5, 16. Look at Luke 6. Just go over page or two. Go to 6.12. It was at this time, it says in Luke chapter 6 verse 12, it was at this time that he went off to the what? To the mountain, to do what?
[time=2600] And he spent the whole night in prayer to whom? To God the Father.
[time=2608] Prayerfully abiding. Communicating with God in a place where he was fixed and remaining and wanting to be. It was at this time that he went off to the mountain to pray. Luke 6, 12. Look at Luke 9. Go over to Luke 9, 18. Turn your Bibles to Luke 9. I hear those pages turning. Good job.
[time=2632] Luke 9, 18. It says in Luke 9, 18, and it happened that while he was praying what? Alone. It happened that while he was praying alone. The disciples were with him and he questioned them saying, "Who do the people say I am?" Go on in that same chapter Luke 9, go to 28. Go to Luke 9, 28, and 29.
[time=2656] Luke 9, 28, 29 says this, "Some eight days after these sayings he took along Peter and John and James and went up on the where? Went up on the mountain to do what?
[time=2668] To pray. And while he was what? Praying.
[time=2672] The appearance of his face became different and his clothing became white and gleaming.
[time=2676] Look at Luke 11. And I'm telling you folks, I promise I'm giving you the condensed list here.
[time=2684] Luke 11, look 11-1. It happened that while Jesus was what? Praying in a certain place after he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray." Just as John also taught his disciples. He had so modeled this idea of praying. He had so modeled in his own life this commitment to slipping away, to be with the Father, to be remaining in him, to be connected to him. He had so modeled this at this point now, the disciples say, "Look, would you please teach us to do that very thing?" Luke 22. Go to Luke 22.
[time=2724] Luke 22-32.
[time=2732] Dealing with Peter here, Simon, Simon, Behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat, but he says in 32, "But I have what? But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail and you, and once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers." Look at verse 40. Luke, same chapter.
[time=2756] Luke 22, go to verse 40.
[time=2760] When he arrived at that place, 39, and he came out and proceeded as was his custom to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him. When he arrived, verse 40 at the place, he said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation and he withdrew." There he goes withdrawing again.
[time=2780] There he goes slipping away again. "And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw away, and he knelt down and begin to do what? To pray, saying, 'Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me, yet not my will, but yours be done.' Now an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him and being an agony. He was praying very fervently and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down upon the ground.
[time=2808] And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow.
[time=2816] John 6, go to the gospel of John.
[time=2820] You go to John 6, 15.
[time=2824] So Jesus, you see it there? John 6, 15.
[time=2828] So Jesus perceiving that they were intending to come and take him by force to make him king withdrew again to the mountain by himself, what?
[time=2840] Alone. My friends, if you ever wondered about, there may be a lot of things you wonder about with regard to the Lord. If you ever wondered about his humanity, we talk about his deity and the fact that he was 100% God.
[time=2856] But we also teach you because the Scriptures teach you that he was 100% what? Man. And in his humanity, he leaves a great example for you and I to follow. Because I tell you, if I would have taken the time to go through every one of those passages, in every one of those passages, he's facing the issues of life.
[time=2880] He's facing the challenges of his ministry. He's facing the ups and the downs of living in a fallen world with fallen people. And again and again and again and again and again we see him going, you know what? I have got to be with the father.
[time=2896] I have got to get away from this. And it may be morning, it may be noon, it may be night, but I have got to prayerfully abide with him.
[time=2908] And he does it. And I want to just ask you today.
[time=2912] I want to ask you, how is that discipline?
[time=2916] You that know him. What's that discipline look like in your life today? How willing are you? How ready are you?
[time=2924] How drawn are you to that idea of that kennel and being in there with him and listening to him and being comfortable there in that place with him and sharing with him what's on your heart and confessing those sins and begging him for guidance and saying back to him those things that are true about him. How regular? How often he did it all the time. He did it situationally.
[time=2952] I mean he not only did it in discipline I believe, he did it in times situationally where he would just come upon something and boom there he goes again. Where's he going? To the mountain.
[time=2964] What's he going to do? Pray.
[time=2968] Let me just real quick give you the act and the attitude of prayer. For many of you in the room this may be review for those of you in the room who this may be review for be careful you don't dismiss this too quickly. I wonder how you're doing with this even if it is familiar for others of you you may have never heard this. Let me just give you some encouragement to pursue the act of praying. A lot of ways you can do this.
[time=2996] This is something that I learned years and years ago into this day in my own personal time with God to this day in our times with our elders to this day as we gather as a staff and pray when I pray with my kid we work on this I give myself to this in many many settings and it's just an acronym A-C-T-S acts.
[time=3020] A-C-T-S and it's just a way that I think really it honors God as we give ourselves to times of prayer and sometimes if you can kind of have just a way to do it it just helps you keep going so let me just offer this to you adoration. You should get on your knees you should slip away you should on your own and you should with your spouse and you could with your kids and you can with your friends and you can as a class I mean in whatever setting but we're talking about here more the personal time you you end him and you can begin that that act of praying by adoring him people say what's it mean to adore God here you go write this down God you are and then put a blank door God is to say to God oh God you are so what is he you're so wonderful you're so good you're so faithful you're so unbelievably huge and big and powerful God you're so patient I mean whatever might come to your mind you could read through here as I hint for you read through the Psalms read through the Psalms as you adore God Psalm 27 1 you could write that down Psalm 30 verses 1 to 3 you could write that down Psalm 34 1 to 3 you could go through the Psalms 27 30 34 and you can see the Psalmist adoring God begin your times of prayer by adoring him teach your kids to adore him God you are so well fill it in a adoration see confession see confession Nehemiah 1 6 Nehemiah 1 6 says this it says in Nehemiah 1 6 let your ear let your ear now be attentive in your eyes open to hear the prayer of your servant which I am praying before you now day and night on behalf of the sons of Israel your servants let your ear confessing the sins of the sons of Israel I have sinned against you I and my father's house have sinned confession Psalm 32 5 write that down look what it says in Psalm 32 5 it says I acknowledge my sin to you just imagine yourself on your knees in that place it may not be a mountain for you it may not be the wilderness for you it may be your back deck it may be in your closet it may be on the floor next to your bed but how important it is that we acknowledge like the psalmist I acknowledge my sin to you and my iniquity I did not hide I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin salah my friends we can't go we can't go very far in this following after him you and I can't get very far down this elemental journey my friends we can't go very far as a ministry if there is in your life or in mine if there is individually and even corporately sin that hasn't been what confessed every day morning noon and night if you're like me it's more than morning noon and night there is almost seemingly a constant need to be saying to him oh god please forgive me for that thought please forgive me
[time=3228] for those words please forgive me for how I handled that please forgive me for what I did just a real need in your life in mind as we pray to confess thanksgiving thanksgiving specific request is S and let me just read Philippians 4 6 and 7 to you turn there if you would Philippians 4 6 and 7 kind of a passage that kind of brings both of those things really brings the whole idea of prayer in the in the context but it mentions there the thanksgiving and the specific requests it says in in verse 6 be anxious for nothing Paul says be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God and if you do that the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus what do you think could you give yourself this week to the discipline of A C T S could you do that couple two three times a day could you do it on your own could you incorporate it with your family I really hope you would give it some thought it's what disciples it's what followers of Christ do they imitate the Lord and the Lord prayed and the Lord slipped away and the Lord wanted to abide with the Father there's also the attitude of prayer and if you would just open in your Bibles to 1 Thessalonians 5 17 and we're going to close with this you see I can't spend my whole day on my knees next to my bed right I can't get out there on my back deck and go through A C T S from 6 in the morning till nine at night I can't do it I can't do the act of prayer but I can live each day I can I can go through the rest of my day with an attitude of prayer what's the screen say everybody together just read it oh sorry there it is say it again pray without ceasing don't ever stop he says and what he's referring to there my friends is a mindset it's a mindset that's being guided by the Holy Spirit it's a mindset that's being guided by the truth it's a mindset that begins with you on your knees A C T S in it but then you get up and you go and you are mindful of him you are sensitive to him all the conversations all the business decisions all the times with friends out on the weekends with your buddies we can do all of that in this mode of praying without ceasing with this attitude of prayer this attitude this realization that I am connected to him and I want to encourage you this week as we go today to stay connected to him there are some things that you and I can do to help that and as you stand and would you do that as you stand this morning just look at the screen you can stick around if you want to jot these things down as you go but some praying without ceasing ideas and I'll just let you look at the screen as we leave this morning go ahead and put them all up there and you may want to write a few of those down you may want to talk about that with some friends but there are some just some practical ideas there for you praying without ceasing keeping the scriptures front and center engaged in accountability avoiding the avoiding the people avoiding the places avoiding the traps avoiding the circumstances that take us out of the kennel I want you to be in that kennel with him and I want you to avoid that stuff that draws you away from him and I pray this week and I will as I abide with him I'll pray that he gives you the strength to prayerfully abide and to experience that intimacy with him that only that only comes with him Father God thank you for your word and thank you for the example of your son as he prayerfully prayerfully was abiding with you may we abide with you God in that same way in your son's name we pray amen
