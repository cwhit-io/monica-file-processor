[time=31] [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=224] - Well hello everybody, welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=226] We're thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=227] If you've been watching for the last few weeks, you know that we find ourselves here at Blackhawk in the midst of a series that we've entitled "Elemental." And the reason we've called it "Elemental" is because of a study we did recently in the world of chemistry or science, if you will.
[time=243] We found out that whenever somebody's after a certain substance, and that's the word they use, substance, a substance is like water or sugar or salt, whenever you're trying to arrive at a certain substance, you have to have certain elements for that substance to be realized.
[time=262] And so as we've looked at the word of God, and as we've studied the scriptures, we've realized that for the church to be all that God intended the church to be, for the church to be full of vision, for the church to be full of strength, for the church to be able to reach not only those inside, it's four walls, but especially those outside it's four walls, for the church to be powerful and anointed and fruitful, the church must be comprised.
[time=288] It must be made up of a certain substance.
[time=291] And that substance we've determined is a disciple.
[time=294] The church, my friends, must be comprised of disciples, Jesus' imitators.
[time=300] And as you look at the Gospels, and as you look at the Book of Acts, and especially as you look at the life of our Lord, you realize that the pattern he set for those that followed him is that their life would be comprised of certain elements, certain disciplines, certain patterns that would go into being a disciple.
[time=321] So we're taking those elements, if you will, one by one.
[time=325] And last week, we looked at the element called prayerful abiding, intimacy with God that is fostered and furthered through prayer.
[time=332] And today we come to element number two.
[time=334] And as you listen to the message this morning, I want to just ask you right now to please, open your heart and mind to what I believe the Spirit of God will have for you today because this second element is a deep commitment to the Word of God.
[time=348] That's right, a disciple, a true and genuine Jesus' imitator will have a huge commitment to the Word of God in his or her life.
[time=357] And by that, we don't mean just that they believe it's true while we mean that.
[time=363] A disciple believes God's Word is true, but more than that, we understand that a disciple takes the Word of God and applies it to the every day of their life.
[time=373] They believe it's true and they go to great lengths to incorporate it into the every day of how they live, the decisions they make, the places they go, the time they spend, a genuine follower of Christ is radically devoted to having the Word of God infiltrate every component of their life.
[time=393] And so I hope as you watch today, you'll give thought to how you could do a better job of that, how you might be able to improve in terms of bringing that Word, the Scriptures to the lives and hearts of your kids.
[time=406] I hope as you listen that God will encourage and grow your heart.
[time=410] We're so thankful for this series.
[time=411] We want to be a place comprised of disciples.
[time=415] And today as we talk about element number two, our hope is that you will be encouraged.
[time=420] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=421] God bless you.
[time=422] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=452] We're on your throne, you reign.
[time=458] You're in the high still reign.
[time=464] Our creation testified by your own reign.
[time=470] Everything will bond every time, proclaim.
[time=477] Jesus reigns.
[time=485] Even before your hand made the heavens.
[time=491] Even before the breath of all mankind.
[time=497] Even before we had to be forgiven.
[time=503] You were on your throne.
[time=506] You were on your throne, you reign.
[time=512] You're in the high still reign.
[time=518] Our creation testified by your own reign.
[time=524] Everything will bond every time, proclaim.
[time=531] And Jesus reigns.
[time=535] Yesterday, today, and forever.
[time=542] You are God who was and is.
[time=549] And it's to come.
[time=556] You reign.
[time=560] For in the high still reign.
[time=563] You reign.
[time=572] For in the high still reign.
[time=577] That creation testified by your own reign.
[time=584] And everything will bond every time, proclaim.
[time=591] And every time, proclaim.
[time=603] And Jesus reigns.
[time=618] [APPLAUSE]
[time=624] [MUSIC]
[time=631] Many of you know this.
[time=633] Maybe some of you don't.
[time=634] But every single time that God gives me the privilege.
[time=638] And it really is that.
[time=639] I hope you understand that I view it that way.
[time=642] It is an absolute privilege to walk up those steps right there.
[time=648] And to stand here with you in this setting.
[time=651] And every single time I do that, you know, I just, and I told you this.
[time=654] I started this years and years ago.
[time=655] I just pray 1 Peter 4, 11.
[time=658] My kids and my wife wrote it in my Bible years ago.
[time=661] And it's on my mind every single time I stand in front of anybody anywhere.
[time=667] But especially it's my prayer here, each and every week, let him who speaks speak as if it were the very utterances of God.
[time=678] And I hope you understand that, you know, if I'm willing to do that, if I'm willing to try and get out of the way, if I'm willing to try my very best to just allow what's said to be the words of God and the truth of God,
[time=690] and I hope you're equally blown away by the opportunity you get each and every week to receive not my words but whose.
[time=699] God's words.
[time=701] And I hope that means a lot to you.
[time=703] And I hope you take it very seriously.
[time=705] As many of you know, in recent days, we've started to take a close look at what we've identified as the five elements that comprise or make up the substance known as a disciple.
[time=720] And here, this is how we've said it.
[time=722] If you're just thinking your mind's for a moment about being thirsty, we talked about this a few weeks ago.
[time=727] If you think about being thirsty, you're dying.
[time=729] Someone's dying of thirst.
[time=731] Somebody dying of thirst needs to have what?
[time=734] Say it out loud?
[time=735] Water.
[time=736] So if the substance in the chemical scientific world that water is called a substance, the substance needed for that person to survive is water.
[time=745] But you don't get water unless you have two elements called hydrogen and oxygen.
[time=751] You've got to have the elements if you're going to have the substance.
[time=754] And if you don't have the substance, somebody's going to die of thirst.
[time=759] In the spiritual arena, the way we've said it is this, the church.
[time=763] If the church is going to be all that God designed the church to be.
[time=767] If the church is going to be this reconciling, redemptive force, if the church is going to serve the needs of people inside and outside these four walls.
[time=779] If the church is going to be all that God designed the church to be, it needs a substance called.
[time=785] It has to be comprised of a thing called a disciple.
[time=790] The church has to be filled with, the church has to be comprised of Jesus' imitators.
[time=797] And you don't get the substance disciple unless you have the appropriate what?
[time=802] Elements.
[time=803] And so we've entitled this series Elemental, a year and a half long study, a prayerful, careful study by our elders and staff searching the scriptures, looking for those disciplines, looking for those patterns, looking for those examples.
[time=819] That those very first Christ followers left us.
[time=825] More importantly, the pattern, the example that Jesus himself left us.
[time=830] This picture of what it means to be one who follows after the son.
[time=835] He patterned it for us.
[time=837] We talked about that word example last week.
[time=839] What a great picture that was.
[time=841] Jesus left an example for you and I.
[time=845] When Jesus said to them, "Come follow me." When Jesus says that very same thing to you and I today, he doesn't leave us stranded.
[time=853] No, he leaves for us this example.
[time=856] The word in the Greek meant something that you would place a piece of paper over and what?
[time=860] Trace.
[time=862] We trace over this example.
[time=866] We trace over these patterns that he left.
[time=870] And as we trace over it, we lift the page up and there we have a duplicate.
[time=875] There we have a replica.
[time=876] There we have our copy of who he was and what he did.
[time=881] The way he thought and the way he taught, the way he lived.
[time=885] Last week we came to element number one.
[time=888] These five descriptive phrases, these disciplines that we're going to be talking about and teaching
[time=896] about in the days to come and last week was element number one, prayerful abiding.
[time=900] We've had some great discussions around here this week on prayerful abiding.
[time=904] I've heard from many of you and I'm so thankful for what God did and is doing in your lives
[time=910] as you think about how we defined it intimacy with God, closeness, abiding, staying in,
[time=916] not departing, being fixed.
[time=919] Like Laker in the Kennel, you and I, residing with him, not departing.
[time=925] And we talked about last week how that intimacy is fostered and furthered through the act and the attitude of prayer.
[time=933] And I tried to get you, I got you an email out midweek.
[time=936] I'm going to try every week through the series to get you an email and post it on my blog.
[time=940] A chance for you midweek and a chance for me midweek to think some things through, pass on some things that maybe have come to us in the days since we met.
[time=950] If you're not on that email list, please get on there.
[time=952] It's just go to the website. If you go down the, I think the right-hand side, you can see where you can sign up for that.
[time=958] But today we come to element number two.
[time=961] Element number two, a disciple of Jesus Christ, my friends, is deeply devoted, not only to prayerful abiding, but a disciple of Jesus Christ is deeply devoted to the Scriptures, to the Word of God.
[time=975] A disciple, just like the one He followed, was deeply committed to God's Word.
[time=983] And we won't go back through it all, you know, we won't go back and say it all to you again, but I want to reference the message a couple of weeks ago where we talked about the tradition that was in place in Jewish culture.
[time=996] Remember how the young boys and the young girls, there was such a devotion and such a commitment on the part of their parents that moms and dads sent their five-year-old boys and girls basically to rabbinical training.
[time=1010] We talked about it. Remember Bates' affair and Bait Talmud and Bait Midrash and simply by just hearing what we heard that week and chewing on it, like many of you have been chewing on it along with me, were reminded of the fact that a disciple is devoted to the Scriptures.
[time=1028] And from the earliest of days in their life they learned to be devoted to the Scriptures.
[time=1034] They were committed to its truth.
[time=1036] They were committed to hiding that truth in their heart.
[time=1039] They were thoroughly and absolutely devoted to the Word of God.
[time=1044] The Word of God was primary and central, and you can follow along here in your notes.
[time=1049] The Word of God was primary and central in the life of a disciple.
[time=1055] I read it, my friends. They went to great links to better understand it.
[time=1060] They listened to others teach it. They memorize it.
[time=1063] They recite it. They'd apply it to the everyday of their life.
[time=1067] They treasured it. The Scriptures.
[time=1072] Yes, the scrolls. Yeah, the book.
[time=1075] I mean, yeah, the, you know, the physical. Yes, but more than that, what they represented.
[time=1080] They treasured God's Word. Think about those things seriously.
[time=1086] Think about some things you treasure in your life.
[time=1090] Think about something you always know where this is.
[time=1093] If you lose this, you go nuts. You go to bed. You know where this is.
[time=1098] Maybe your family gives you a bad time about it. I don't know, but just think about something that you absolutely treasure.
[time=1104] You're never without it. You're all, some folks are thinking cell phone right now, I know.
[time=1109] Think about that something in your life that it means so much to you.
[time=1114] You know exactly where it is. You have deep feelings about it.
[time=1118] And understand that is how they felt about the Scriptures.
[time=1124] Disciples were absolutely drawn to it. It was their right to stand. It was their authoritative guide.
[time=1131] It was their authoritative guide through life. Their only source of absolute authority.
[time=1137] And I want to stop right here. I'm not actually stopped. I want to keep going, but I want to just pause here and get us two together this morning here in this room. Give some thought to this very concept.
[time=1148] It was their only source of absolute authority. It was their authoritative guide through life.
[time=1156] It is how they navigated all that they faced and all that they encountered.
[time=1162] All decisions that were made. The Scriptures so filled them.
[time=1167] And the Scripture was something they were so committed to. It was their authoritative guide.
[time=1172] Is it with you? Is it really with you? Are the Scriptures the final authority in your life?
[time=1185] In all of life's circumstances, in all of life's choices and decisions, is God's Word for you really truly?
[time=1193] I mean like really, truly. The bottom line.
[time=1198] Are you willing to abide? Remember that word from last week to remain in, to not depart from, to be fixed and attached to?
[time=1205] Are you really willing to abide in God's Word?
[time=1212] As you face the real, and I underlined this, the real, everyday issues of life.
[time=1218] Is the Word of God something that comes into your life on Sunday mornings at 11.23?
[time=1225] Is the Word of God something that you tinker with? Is the Word of God something that's peripheral?
[time=1231] Or is the Word of God central and primary? And do you hang on to it?
[time=1236] Do you treasure it? And is it the bottom line authority for all that you would face and see in the everyday of life?
[time=1244] Because you understand, right? You understand that His Word.
[time=1249] You understand that the Scriptures do speak to the real, everyday issues of your life in mind.
[time=1258] This could be a two-week series right here, but we'll just make it a few minutes.
[time=1262] But I had to write just a few things down for you. Real, everyday issues, alright?
[time=1266] Let's just make sure we're all on the same page. This is by no means an exhaustive list.
[time=1271] This is just 15 minutes scribbling some things down that came to my mind that seemed to me to be so blatantly clear for you and for me.
[time=1280] Real, everyday issues addressed in God's Word. Real, everyday issues that you, real, everyday issues that I have to deal with.
[time=1291] These are things you and I have to deal with, make decisions on, posture ourselves toward or again.
[time=1297] I mean, these are things we have to wrestle with all the time.
[time=1301] And where does God's Word in your life stand as it relates to how you deal with, think about, and choose on these fronts?
[time=1311] Just a few. Sexual activity before or outside of marriage.
[time=1317] The whole, the whole sexual realm that you and I are bombarded with each and every day doesn't matter how old we are.
[time=1328] Doesn't matter where we go to school. Doesn't matter what kind of family we come from. Doesn't matter where we attend or don't attend.
[time=1335] This is something that you and I see each and every day. We see it, we hear it.
[time=1341] And how are you allowing God's Word to guide you through that kind of course 1 Thessalonians 4?
[time=1349] Would you look there? 1 Thessalonians 4, just one of a dozen places we could go in our effort to have the Word of God be the final authority with an issue such as this.
[time=1362] 1 Thessalonians 4, we'll start in verse 3.
[time=1372] This is what God wants, your sanctification, big word for spiritual growth.
[time=1378] That is that you abstain from sexual immorality, sexual activity, sexual involvement, sexual dealings outside of the parameters that God has established.
[time=1391] Before or outside of marriage.
[time=1397] That is that you abstain from sexual immorality, that each verse 4, that each of you know how to possess his own vessel.
[time=1405] What you think that word means is what it means.
[time=1409] Your own body and that body's functions in this arena.
[time=1416] That each of you know how to possess self-control, maintain his own vessel in what?
[time=1424] In sanctification and honor, not in lustful passion, not out of control, but in control.
[time=1432] Not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God and that no man transgress or defraud his brother.
[time=1441] In this arena of sexual activity, what happens is that people cross over lines.
[time=1447] There's lines that have been clearly established for our benefit and for our health and for the glory and honor of God.
[time=1454] And when you transgress as the text says, it means to step over a line, a line drawn by whom?
[time=1460] God.
[time=1461] And defraud, we step over lines and then in this discussion that we're in here,
[time=1468] in the activity that surrounds this discussion, what happens is we step over lines and then folks start taking things, literally, physically.
[time=1477] That aren't theirs to take because they're outside the parameters of what God established, which is inside of marriage.
[time=1484] And so we get prior to or outside of marriage and then we step over lines and we take stuff.
[time=1490] It's not ours to take and we defraud.
[time=1494] And the text here says, "And that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things."
[time=1504] I read all that to you, just to trigger in your mind the question, is that the bottom line for you?
[time=1511] You and I have to deal with this.
[time=1513] You and I have to make decisions as it relates to this.
[time=1516] What is the final authoritative guide for you and me as we navigate these waters?
[time=1524] Parenting.
[time=1527] Real everyday issues addressed in God's Word.
[time=1530] Believe me, I need help with this. Believe me.
[time=1533] We continually come before God and others asking for advice and direction, but we're so thankful God's Word speaks to this.
[time=1541] Left to myself, all right, if I was just going to be honest with you, left to myself, I pretty much would just want my kids to be happy.
[time=1548] I would just want to smile back at me.
[time=1550] I would just want there to be no conflict.
[time=1552] I'd want there to be no tension.
[time=1554] I want everybody to get along and for the most part left to myself, I'd just probably just say yes, yes, yes, and yes, as long as it just made them happy.
[time=1562] But I've understood over the years through the pages of God's Word and wise counsel that happy kids who get told yes all the time oftentimes end up being selfish, spoiled, self-centered, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 38 year olds.
[time=1582] So we're trying our best and not just on our own, but with the guidance given from God's Word.
[time=1589] I want our kids to be mature.
[time=1591] You want your kids to be respectful.
[time=1593] We wait long for a day when one day they can stand before their God and in the community of faith that they're a part of and be humble, be servants, be others-centered.
[time=1604] Well, how is that going to happen?
[time=1605] Thank God for His Word.
[time=1608] So many things, just a few things that came to my mind, you go to Proverbs.
[time=1613] You go to the book of Proverbs, Proverbs 13, Proverbs 13, 24.
[time=1621] Proverbs 13, 24 says this.
[time=1625] It says, "He who withholds his rod, hates his son, he who withholds the rod of discipline, hates his son."
[time=1634] You see that? The parent, the mom, the dad, who doesn't take the time to discipline, who won't go the extra mile, even though it's inconvenient, even though you don't have time, even though it's going to completely mess up the evening.
[time=1650] The parent who doesn't take the time to lovingly bring the rod of discipline, hates his son or daughter, but he who loves him, disciplines him every so often?
[time=1664] No, diligently, persistently, lovingly, yes, but diligently, nonetheless, goes on in 22, 22, 15, so many places we could go.
[time=1677] And again, I'm just reading this to you to ask you, is the Word of God your bottom line?
[time=1681] It speaks to the everyday issues of life.
[time=1684] 22, 15, foolishness, it says, is bound up in the heart of a child.
[time=1689] The rod of discipline will remove it far from him.
[time=1693] God's Word says that if, in fact, you and I don't want our kids to end up being fools, then we're going to have to be willing and disciplined ourselves to with God's help.
[time=1706] And this agent of correction called discipline, remove, it says it removes the foolishness from them when you and I are given and willing to walk that road with them.
[time=1717] Ephesians 6, 1 to 3, classic passage, love what it says, children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is what?
[time=1728] For this is what?
[time=1731] To say 18-year-old children, we won't get into that. It's an amazing passage because it really has implications for all of us.
[time=1737] Anybody in the room have a parent raise your hand.
[time=1740] Yeah, see, it's like it's really, really important. Honor your father and mother.
[time=1744] And there's a longer discussion we could have on that, but I want you to catch the spirit of this.
[time=1748] Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, so that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.
[time=1758] Ephesians 6, 1 to 3, parenting, is it your bottom line?
[time=1763] Is that what you're teaching your kids? Is that what you're modeling for your kids?
[time=1768] Serving, here's one for you, serving.
[time=1771] You and I, every single day, face opportunities, sometimes we take it, sometimes we don't, but in the life of your family and the life of my family and the life of your kids, we have this opportunity to serve.
[time=1786] What is your response? What is my response to the poor, to the marginalized, to the weak, to those in need?
[time=1793] Look at James 1, 27. Go back toward the back of your New Testament. Hebrews, James 1, 27.
[time=1801] Actually, we're going to start at 26.
[time=1803] If anyone thinks himself to be religious, spiritual, godly, and yet does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion, this man's spirit.
[time=1815] This man's spirituality, this man's godliness is worthless.
[time=1819] Pure and undefiled religion. Sound interesting?
[time=1823] Pure and undefiled godliness.
[time=1826] Pure and undefiled spirituality in the sight of our God.
[time=1831] Forget about what I might think. Forget about what the person next to you might think.
[time=1835] This verse tells you what God thinks. And God thinks that pure, undefiled religion is to visit orphans and widows.
[time=1845] To visit orphans and widows in their what? Say it out loud, everybody.
[time=1850] They're distressed and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
[time=1856] Pure, what's your bottom line as you face opportunities each and every day?
[time=1863] As you face, as you hear about, as you're aware of those who are in distress, what guides you there?
[time=1872] How do you make those choices? What will you do?
[time=1875] Is the Word of God your authoritative God had an amazing privilege this week?
[time=1881] I don't use, I use that word and I mean it, my friends. It was an amazing opportunity this week.
[time=1888] There were some folks from our family here and there were some people from some other local churches who came collaboratively together
[time=1896] because of a common love they have for a family, a family that's been a part of our church for a while
[time=1903] and their 16-year-old daughter, Cassie. Cassie hooks her name.
[time=1907] Cassie's been fighting about a two-year battle with leukemia and it's not been going well.
[time=1912] Recently they did get some good news with respect to remission but now treatments are beginning
[time=1918] and it's going to be a long brutal fight and these folks saw her distress.
[time=1923] These people were aware of the need that was there, this family.
[time=1927] Because of their attempts to try and keep Cassie away from germs and infection and things that would complicate the situation
[time=1935] they haven't been to church, they haven't been in a corporate setting, they haven't been gathered with the body for a long, long time.
[time=1942] And so these folks thought it would be a great idea if they would give, they would serve that family.
[time=1948] So they put together a worship service, they put together, they asked me to come and speak and they had that worship leader from Brookside came and there were some other really, really close friends
[time=1960] and then probably, I don't know, 80 or so folks and they did it in the back yard so you couldn't get close to her, right?
[time=1967] Or they didn't want a lot of folks close to her, so we had it in the back yard and they had kind of a grassy area
[time=1973] then with a short fence around their back yard and everybody came and stood at the fence.
[time=1979] Everybody just came in and they just stood at the fence and they had signs and they all had pictures of Cassie tape
[time=1988] and they pinned to their shirts or their coats and said pray for Cassie and this guy led us in worship, it was just really simple but really, really sweet
[time=1999] and these people are singing their lungs out, the family's out in their back yard sitting on their lawn chairs,
[time=2005] the family's kind of standing and Cassie's sitting and they're just weeping.
[time=2010] They're just weeping because it meant so much to them that in their distress the body of Christ would come and serve.
[time=2020] This body of Christ guided and navigated by the truth of God that says pure, undefiled religion is when you help meet the needs of those who are hurting.
[time=2031] And I shared a little bit from the scriptures and then we wanted to lay hands on her and pray but we couldn't touch her
[time=2037] so they all just stood at the gate, they all just stood at the fence and everybody just reached their hands out and I put my hands on the mom and the worship leader from Brookside, he kind of put his hands on the other end of the family line
[time=2050] and we just lifted her up and it was one of the sweetest experiences I've been a part of in a long, long time.
[time=2057] Sexual activity, parenting, serving, what we choose to expose our minds to, there you go.
[time=2064] Write that one down, what we choose to expose our minds to, there isn't a person in this room who isn't making a decision on that front 20, 30, 40 times a day because there are so many things clamoring for your mind's attention.
[time=2081] Bottom line, what's your bottom line on how you're going to navigate that?
[time=2086] Look at Philippians 4 8 9, Philippians 4 8 9, Paul writes to the church at Philippi, they were having issues, they were having struggles with what they were dwelling on
[time=2096] what they were thinking about. Paul tries to, God tries to, through Paul's pen, move them in a good direction.
[time=2103] Finally, brethren, he says, whatever is true and I want you to think about your iPods.
[time=2110] I want you to think about your computer, I want you to think about the radio and your car, I want you to think about the books you read, I want you to think about the shows you watch.
[time=2120] I just want you to think about every single input that exists in your life and ask yourself the question, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right,
[time=2137] whatever is, everybody say that word. Whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, watch it.
[time=2151] Listen to it, click on it, take it all in, surround yourself with it.
[time=2157] But if it doesn't, if it doesn't have those things, if those things are not consistent with, if those things don't describe it, then stay away from it.
[time=2167] Move away from it, delete it, get it off of what I mean, just don't go there, don't expose your mind and your heart and your soul to it.
[time=2178] Real everyday issues in God's Word, God's Word speaking to those things, here's the point my friends, genuine disciple, a true Christ follower, navigates the everyday issues of life with the word of God illuminating.
[time=2194] I love that phrase and I love that picture because you know and I know sometimes it gets really dark.
[time=2201] Sometimes these decisions get really hard, sometimes you and I find ourselves in situations that are very difficult to navigate, sometimes it gets really cloudy and we need help and look at Psalm 119 105.
[time=2214] Many of you know the verse, others of you maybe have never heard it before, what an amazing picture it paints on 119 105.
[time=2224] You see it there? Your Word is a what? Say it.
[time=2229] Your Word, the Scripture is my friend, a disciple knows that the Word of God is a lamp for his feet and a light to my path.
[time=2241] You'll notice it's the second symbol up here. On our five symbols, the Word of God illuminating and you've got to be reading it, you've got to be studying it, you've got to be hiding it in your heart.
[time=2252] It's got to be nearby, you've got to have access to it for it to light your path in the everyday real issues of life.
[time=2262] Let's keep going. The Word of God was central and primary in the lives of those first Jesus imitators back in the gospels in the book of Acts.
[time=2273] It was central and primary in their lives and there are a number of things that point toward this.
[time=2279] I just got a couple here for you this morning. Number one, they gathered to hear it taught.
[time=2284] It meant that much to them. It was that important to them. They gathered as a body. They gathered as a community to hear it taught.
[time=2293] Acts 2.42. We read it last week. They were, everybody read this out loud. Everybody just write, you can look at the screen or read it from your NASB.
[time=2302] Everybody go. They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[time=2314] They were continually, later in that passage, continually gets defined day by day.
[time=2325] They gathered every single day because it was that important to them that their minds and their hearts and their lives be saturated with the scriptures so they could make the decisions they needed to make in the everyday of their life.
[time=2343] The singular and foundational content for the believers in that day, for the believer's spiritual growth and maturity was the scriptures.
[time=2354] God's revealed truth which the apostles had received and now they were teaching it faithfully, daily in the temple courtyard and even house to house.
[time=2365] This was the source. The scriptures were the source of their spiritual progress.
[time=2372] Paul knew this later. Saul who used to persecute Christians becomes Paul who plants churches. Paul becomes an apostle.
[time=2382] Paul becomes one who with God's help, births church after church after church, encourages and strengthens, believers all over the land.
[time=2391] Paul knew the great value of God's word. If you look at 2 Timothy 3 16, somebody told me after 1st hour, the second most,
[time=2401] the second most popular 3 16 in the New Testament.
[time=2406] I think referring to John 3 16, well then don't forget 2 Timothy 3 16.
[time=2411] Here Paul lays out what is so very important for you and I to understand.
[time=2416] It says all scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training.
[time=2426] A disciple in that day knew, a disciple understood that the scriptures were good, the disciple understood he needed God's word for teaching,
[time=2436] the disciple needed to be reproved by God's word, the disciple needed to be corrected by God's word,
[time=2443] the disciple needed to be trained in God's word so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.
[time=2453] And I'll tell you what, one of the great concerns, one of the great nightmares of my life, one of the things that would trouble me the most,
[time=2462] would be to think that somehow in the midst of us doing this on a regular basis, somehow you would walk out of this place someday,
[time=2471] that somehow you would go to your place of work, somehow you would go and be with those that you're with each and every day and not be adequate,
[time=2480] not be equipped, not be built up in the very truth that gives you the strength to be who God's called you to be in those places and in those settings.
[time=2494] They gathered together to hear it taught every single day.
[time=2501] They passed it on to their children, I don't want you to miss this, they passed it on to their children.
[time=2507] And I just, as I studied this week and even a little bit last week, I was reminded of the fact of this, my friends,
[time=2514] most of you in the room know that when Jesus came, when Jesus comes and lives and dies and defeats death,
[time=2522] in the coming of Messiah, the law, the law of the Old Testament, you and I know was fulfilled.
[time=2529] And so those who follow Christ then and those of us who want to follow Christ today, we know that we're not bound by the law.
[time=2538] We know that we're now free in Christ, He is the fulfillment of that law and we are no longer slaves to the particulars of what we saw there in the Old Testament.
[time=2549] But I want to tell you this, as you study the early church, you realize that these folks, while they realize their freedom,
[time=2556] there was still a great commitment to some of the really, really healthy traditions that they had learned
[time=2563] and that they had been exposed to because they were of that Jewish faith and culture.
[time=2568] One of those is something called the Shema.
[time=2571] Many of you may know the Shema, but I want you to understand that Christ followers in the early church
[time=2578] when it came to their parenting and when it came to them passing along this commitment to Scripture,
[time=2584] I want you to understand they were very, very devoted to and very mindful of what it says in Deuteronomy.
[time=2591] Turn there, would you back to the beginning of the Old Testament, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy 6?
[time=2600] It says in Deuteronomy 6, let me just first read verses 1 and 2 and then I'll get to what's known as the Shema.
[time=2605] Now this is the commandment, referring to the Scriptures here.
[time=2609] Now this is the commandment Moses says, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God has commanded me to teach you,
[time=2619] that you might do them in the land where you are going over to possess it, so that you and your son and your grandson
[time=2628] might fear the Lord your God to keep all his statutes, all the Scripture that God gives and his commandments,
[time=2636] which I command you all the days of your life and that your days may be prolonged.
[time=2642] Now look what it says here in Deuteronomy 6 and think about this.
[time=2646] Moms and dads, think about this. Grandmas and grandpas, think about it.
[time=2649] Older brothers, older sisters, think about it. Sunday school teachers, anybody in the room who has the privilege of investing
[time=2656] in someone younger, look at the role the Scriptures played in these people's hearts.
[time=2662] Moses said, these words, verse 6, which I am commanding you today, parents,
[time=2671] shall be on your heart, mom and dad, you shall, you, mom and dad, shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them, interact with the kids about them,
[time=2683] explain them the words to the kids.
[time=2687] Go back and forth and dialogue with them, you shall talk of them when you sit in your house,
[time=2695] when you walk by the way, when you lie down and when you rise up,
[time=2702] you shall teach them diligently and you shall talk of them.
[time=2706] The difference between teaching and talking, it's an interesting study.
[time=2709] When you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down and when you rise up, you shall bind them, these words, mom and dad, you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, right, right there.
[time=2721] The visual, the imagery is amazing. You'll have the word of God right there so that you won't forget
[time=2728] to pass it along to them, to teach them and talk with them.
[time=2734] They shall be as frontals hanging off your forehead right in front of you.
[time=2740] You shall write them on the doorpost of your house and on your gates.
[time=2746] How are you doing on this one?
[time=2749] Moms and dads, we've talked about it before and I'm going to keep talking to you about it.
[time=2753] It helps me to keep talking about it, it helps us to keep pursuing the discipline of regular times
[time=2760] with our kids where we're teaching and talking, younger ones and older ones.
[time=2766] Is the word of God in your morning routine?
[time=2772] Is the word of God in your drive to school?
[time=2774] Is the word of God in your weekend?
[time=2777] Please, please give some thought.
[time=2779] The word of God was also central and primary to the Lord Jesus.
[time=2784] The word of God, the scriptures, my friends, it was central and primary to the Lord Jesus as well.
[time=2791] Jesus, write this down. It's an amazing statement, but it's true.
[time=2794] Jesus himself relied on the scriptures.
[time=2799] Jesus relied on the word of God.
[time=2801] Jesus, the Son of God, needed the scriptures to face and endure the challenges of life,
[time=2807] specifically the temptation of Satan.
[time=2810] We referenced this a couple of weeks ago, but look at Matthew 4 real quick.
[time=2814] First book there in the New Testament, Matthew chapter 4 verse 1.
[time=2821] I know this is Jesus, but again, Jesus said, "Come follow who?" Jesus said, "Come follow me." So let's you and I think about following him in the way he dealt with temptation.
[time=2833] Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
[time=2838] And after he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he then became hungry and the tempter came
[time=2844] and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
[time=2851] I could take you back through the everyday issues of life we talked about earlier.
[time=2857] You and I know the tempter comes to you every day saying to you as it relates to sexual activity,
[time=2864] saying to you as it relates to parenting, saying to you as it relates to serving those in need.
[time=2871] The tempter comes to you and says, "Hey, how about this?"
[time=2877] And our response can be just like the one whom we follow, just like his response.
[time=2885] But he answered and said, "Duturonomy 8 is where he's quoting from.
[time=2890] It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
[time=2896] Jesus' response directly and immediately to the temptation with Scripture.
[time=2902] And the devil took him into the holy city and had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, "If you're the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written." Now Satan comes.
[time=2912] This is a battle. This is like a battle. This is like a cage deal.
[time=2916] They have those cage fights. I mean, these guys are going at it.
[time=2921] And now Satan's bringing the word to combat Jesus.
[time=2925] And now Jesus is going to just strike back.
[time=2929] He says, "For it is written, He will command His angels concerning you, and on their hands they will bear you up
[time=2935] so that you will not strike your foot against the stone." So jump.
[time=2939] And Jesus said, "On the other hand, it is written, boom, counterpunch, you shall not put the Lord your God to the test."
[time=2947] Deuteronomy 6.
[time=2948] Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all their glory
[time=2954] and said to him, "All these things I will give you if you fall down and worship me." Satan.
[time=2960] And Jesus said to him, "Scripture." Jesus says, "Word of God, go Satan for it is written, you shall worship the Lord your God and serve him only." I love this.
[time=2970] Then the devil left him.
[time=2972] Wouldn't you love for the devil to leave you?
[time=2979] Wouldn't you love it?
[time=2981] In the midst of that dark deal that you deal with, whatever that is, for him to just leave you alone.
[time=2989] And not only did he leave, it says that the devil left him and behold angels came and began to minister to him.
[time=2997] How would that be?
[time=2999] For not only the devil to leave you, but then for you to be ministered to by the angels.
[time=3004] It's what happens when you and I stand on truth in the face of temptation when the Word of God is central and primary.
[time=3013] It's an amazing thing.
[time=3015] One way you can describe the Scriptures, and I often do is this, and I want to just invite the band to come on back up
[time=3023] and I want you all to listen please as they do.
[time=3025] One way you can describe the Scriptures, and I often do describe them this way, is that they are life.
[time=3033] The Scriptures have the capacity to be life restoring.
[time=3037] They restore and renew the disciples' heart.
[time=3041] Have you experienced that?
[time=3043] The Scriptures restore, they have the capacity to restore and renew the disciples' heart.
[time=3050] They can, they can on the one hand, they can, they have the power to keep you and I from sin.
[time=3055] Jesus, in His interaction with Satan, they can keep one from sin.
[time=3059] But here's what I want to make sure you hear this morning.
[time=3062] Sometimes you make choices as do I, and we move into sin.
[time=3068] And I want to remind you this morning that the Scriptures, while they have the power to keep you from it, they also have the power to rescue you from it.
[time=3077] They have the power to revive you out of it.
[time=3081] And if you don't think so, just follow along here real quick.
[time=3086] I love that word revive, something's dead and now it gets brought back to life.
[time=3090] Something's really broken and now it gets fixed.
[time=3092] Something's absolutely just strewn all over the place and God comes along and revives it and puts it back together.
[time=3100] Look at Psalm 119, look at verse 37, "Turn away my eyes from looking at vanity and revive me in your ways."
[time=3108] The way is another word there for Scripture.
[time=3110] "Behold, I long for your precepts revive me through your righteousness."
[time=3116] He goes on in 88 to say, "Revive me according to your loving kindness so that I may keep the testimony of your mouth.
[time=3123] I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have what?" Say it.
[time=3129] Revive me.
[time=3130] Maybe you're here in the room this morning and you've experienced that.
[time=3133] Maybe you've gone to the Word of God in your darkest moment and felt its reviving power.
[time=3140] I'm exceedingly afflicted.
[time=3142] Revive me, O Lord, according to your Word.
[time=3146] Hear my voice according to your loving kindness.
[time=3149] Revive me, O Lord, according to your ordinances.
[time=3153] Plead my cause and redeem me.
[time=3156] Revive me according to your what?
[time=3158] Say it.
[time=3159] Your word.
[time=3161] Great are your mercies, O Lord.
[time=3163] Revive me according to your ordinances." There it is again, and then 1.59.
[time=3168] Consider how I love your precepts.
[time=3171] Revive me, O Lord, according to your loving kindness.
[time=3176] My friends, disciples have a deep devotion to God's Word.
[time=3180] And I am so thankful for these words of God and the hope and the promise and the strength
[time=3186] they bring.
[time=3187] Listen, would you?
[time=3188] Just take a moment and listen to these words that are sung and then in a moment we'll have a chance to respond.
[time=3206] Holy words, love is set for walk in this world.
[time=3218] They reside with God's own heart, only the ancient words in mind.
[time=3230] Words of life, words of hope, give us strength, help us go.
[time=3240] In this world where we roam, ancient words will guide us home.
[time=3250] Each and Earth's ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=3260] We have gone with all the hearts, for let the ancient words imply.
[time=3285] Holy words of our faith handed down to the search,
[time=3294] came to us through sacrifice, He put forth words of Christ.
[time=3306] Holy words come preserved for our walk in this world.
[time=3316] They reside with God's own heart, only the ancient words in mind.
[time=3326] Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=3335] We have gone with open hearts, for let the ancient words imply.
[time=3347] It is called the word.
[time=3350] The book of the covenant.
[time=3351] The sword of the spirit.
[time=3353] The holy scripture.
[time=3355] The truth.
[time=3356] It is divinely inspired, written by over 40 different people.
[time=3361] Unalterable.
[time=3363] One work, one author.
[time=3365] Written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.
[time=3368] It is inscribed by the finger of God himself.
[time=3372] It's been translated.
[time=3373] Examined, expounded, commentated and criticized.
[time=3378] But his word has never, ever changed.
[time=3382] We are called to diligently study the scriptures.
[time=3385] We are to hide it in our hearts.
[time=3387] We are to write his words on the door frames of our houses and our gates.
[time=3392] We are to read his law aloud so that everyone can listen and learn to fear the Lord our God.
[time=3399] We read this book to know him more fully.
[time=3403] To attain wisdom and discipline.
[time=3406] Because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and from his mouth come all understanding and knowledge.
[time=3413] We are to read them all the blessings and the curses.
[time=3417] We shall not let the book of the law depart from our mouths.
[time=3420] We are to meditate on these words of his day and night.
[time=3423] We are to teach them to our children.
[time=3426] We are to talk about them when we sit at home.
[time=3428] And when we walk along the roads.
[time=3429] And when we lie down.
[time=3430] And when we get up.
[time=3432] It is our fixed point of reference.
[time=3435] Our standard to which everything is judged.
[time=3438] It convicts us of our sins.
[time=3440] It is the belt of truth in the full armor of God.
[time=3444] It is our defense against the enemy.
[time=3447] The word of the Lord is perfect reviving the soul.
[time=3454] Trustworthy making wise the simple.
[time=3456] Right.
[time=3457] Giving joy to the heart.
[time=3459] Radiant.
[time=3460] Giving light to the eyes.
[time=3462] All together righteous.
[time=3464] Precious than goals.
[time=3466] Sweeter than hunting.
[time=3468] Ancient words ever true.
[time=3470] Changing me and changing you.
[time=3473] We have come with open hearts.
[time=3476] Let the ancient words impart.
