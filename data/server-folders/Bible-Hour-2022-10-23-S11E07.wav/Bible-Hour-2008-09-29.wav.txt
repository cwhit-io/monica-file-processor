[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Hey, everybody, welcome to the broadcast today.
[time=34] I wanna thank you for tuning in, and I want you to know how important it is that we get these few minutes each and every week.
[time=40] It's very important to me, and I'm thankful for a number of reasons.
[time=44] One of the reasons is in these few minutes, sometimes I get to share with you things about the message that you're about to hear.
[time=50] It gives me a chance to kind of get you thinking and prepare your heart for what I know the broadcast will bring to you that day.
[time=58] On other occasions, I like to use these few minutes to tell you about things that are going on here at Blackhawk.
[time=64] We view you as part of the Blackhawk family, and we want you to be aware of the opportunities that are here for you.
[time=70] Today, I wanna do just that.
[time=72] And I wanna speak to those of you who have the opportunity to be raising children.
[time=76] Maybe they're your own kids, maybe you're an aunt, an uncle, maybe you're a grandmother, a grandfather, to any of you who have the opportunity to be influencing young ones today.
[time=88] I wanna tell you about our children's ministry opportunity here at Blackhawk.
[time=92] Janice Morese is the gal who gives oversight to our entire children's ministry effort, and Janice and her team do an unbelievable job each and every week.
[time=102] You may not realize this, but there are literally hundreds of kids here on campus each Sunday morning, and from the lessons that are taught, the crafts and the games that are played, the relationships that are formed.
[time=117] I mean, the staff does an incredible job of investing God's truth and God's love into our little ones, from the nursery, from the newborn all the way up through fifth grade.
[time=128] Janice and her team have put together an amazing Sunday morning opportunity that I don't want you or your kids to miss.
[time=135] So give some thought to that.
[time=136] Maybe you're not coming on Sunday mornings, or maybe you're just coming to the worship service.
[time=140] I'll tell you what, come and bring your kids and let them be filled up with the truth of God's word, and let them be loved on by some people who are absolutely amazing at what they do.
[time=151] Hey, a quick note on children's ministry, they also run seasonal opportunities, like the one coming up now in the fall called Hot Shots.
[time=159] It is a basketball ministry.
[time=161] Hot Shots is a great tool for us at Black Caught to connect with our community.
[time=166] It's a great chance to teach kids more about basketball, a great chance for them to be involved at a competitive level, but also a chance for us while playing basketball coaches and staff people are investing God's word and God's truth into their lives.
[time=181] If you have questions about Hot Shots, if you have questions about any of our children's ministry opportunities, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=187] You can call the church office here at this number on the screen and ask to be connected to the children's ministry office.
[time=194] You can also go online and look at some of the children's ministry options there as well.
[time=199] We are thankful for you and we're really thankful for the chance that God gives us with your children.
[time=205] They are our next generation and we want to do everything we can to invest in them and build into them in ways that would make a difference in their life.
[time=213] Hey, thank you so much for tuning in today.
[time=215] We're thankful that you're here.
[time=217] God bless you and have a great week.

has come to faith in Christ [MUSIC] A disciple is one who has fully surrendered himself [MUSIC] or herself, all of them to him [MUSIC] To follow after him and his teaching [MUSIC] In my reading this week I was reminded why [MUSIC] I was reminded why all over again [MUSIC] I am so interested in re-embracing this term [MUSIC] I was reminded this week as I read [MUSIC] It was a book called "The Spirit of the Disciplines" [MUSIC] by Dallas Willard [MUSIC] And as I read it just struck me all over again [MUSIC] Why it is I would want for me in my own life and experience [MUSIC] And why I would want for all of us [MUSIC] To truly and really re-embrace this idea of being disciples [MUSIC] As I read I was reminded that for years Christianity has been criticized [MUSIC] For being impractical and ineffective [MUSIC] When it comes to issues of justice, peace, compassion, and transformation [MUSIC] People will ask does it really work? [MUSIC] Maybe they've asked you that, they've certainly asked me that [MUSIC] I couldn't begin to recount for you the conversations I've been in with people [MUSIC] Who genuinely look me in the eye and ask me this Christianity that you talk about [MUSIC] This Christianity, this movement that you're a part of [MUSIC] Is it really effective? Does it really work? Does it really make a difference? [MUSIC] They oftentimes will say, if it's so effective [MUSIC] Then why to us? Does it seem as if it's not affecting very much these days? [MUSIC] They'll ask me if it's so transformational [MUSIC] Why does it seem that even within your own group, you know, they'll kind of point to the church [MUSIC] Not many people seem to be being transformed [MUSIC] What's the deal with this? They ask. ♪
[time=592] Well, Dallas Willard in his book says this, that criticism, according to Willard, is largely justified when applied to the posture usually taken by those in the Christian faith throughout history.
[time=606] More often than not, that faith has failed, sadly enough, to transform the human character of the Christian masses
[time=614] because that faith has been for so long unaccompanied by everybody say it out loud.
[time=621] Discipleship and an overall discipline that faith has for so long been unaccompanied
[time=627] by discipleship and an overall discipline of life such as Jesus himself practiced and what?
[time=635] There's our word, patterned.
[time=639] Jesus leaves a pattern. Jesus gives himself over and over again to these elemental disciplines in his life.
[time=649] And you know what, my friends? As Jesus gave himself to these elemental disciplines, as Jesus practiced these things, as he leaves a pattern, the word there in the Greek, for example,
[time=660] is to trace over, to take your life and my life and lay it down on his life and trace over what he did
[time=667] and where he went and how he lived. And we duplicate it. We replicate it.
[time=672] We're to be like him. And he was, I've been reminded all over again this week. He was, my friends, he was effective.
[time=681] He was transforming. And he says, and we keep coming back to this week after week in this series,
[time=690] he says to you and he says to me, like he said to those young boys on the beach that day, come, what?
[time=697] Follow me. Practice what I practiced.
[time=704] Follow after, trace with your life my pattern that I have left for you. Jesus practiced.
[time=711] He established a pattern of prayerful abiding. Prayerful abiding was the first element we looked at,
[time=717] intimacy with God, staying in that posture, staying being committed to remain in intimacy with him.
[time=725] But intimacy with God oftentimes fostered and furthered through prayer, the active prayer and the attitude of prayer.
[time=731] We talked about that a few weeks ago. Jesus models for us and those that followed after him modeled for us,
[time=738] this discipline of prayerful abiding, to who they were, it's what they did, it's what they gave themselves to.
[time=745] Jesus practiced my friends and he established a pattern of devotion to the Scriptures.
[time=750] We talked about that last week, element number two, a deep commitment to the Word of God, a commitment to the Word of God.
[time=756] Besides God, over and above all other commitments, my commitment is to His truth.
[time=761] It guides me, it brings light to my path. Jesus practiced, He established a pattern of prayerful abiding, devotion to the Scriptures.
[time=772] We saw the early church, we saw the early church with great aggression and with great persistence.
[time=779] It says they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching of the truth of God's Word.
[time=788] Thirdly this morning, I want to take you to a new element. One that I think is a little risky in some ways.
[time=796] You'll understand that as we get into it. I think it's very challenging.
[time=800] I think maybe of all the elements that we'll study here, this one I think has the potential to turn this place,
[time=806] to turn your life and mind, to turn our fellowship, this community of believers, absolutely upside down.
[time=813] This element, as I watch Jesus leading us a pattern of it, as I watch the early church giving themselves diligently to it,
[time=825] this element, my friends, is potent. This element, my friends, is absolutely powerful.
[time=831] And I want to get into it this morning with you. Jesus practiced, He established a pattern of transformational community.
[time=839] Would you write that down? Transformational community, let me just speak to the word just for a moment.
[time=847] When we talk about transformational community, there is a sense where we as believers experience community
[time=853] in that we are together in our commitment toward Christ.
[time=857] There is a sense of commonality. There is a sense of being together.
[time=861] And we could be together as a thousand. We could be together as ten thousand.
[time=865] We could be together as fifty thousand people committed to and given in our hearts to Him.
[time=871] And there would be, in that sense, a sense of community. We understand that.
[time=877] What we talk about here is what Jesus modeled though, where He takes the community as a whole and He breaks it down
[time=883] and there was a practice. There was a pattern that He had of experiencing community in a smaller setting.
[time=891] While Jesus was committed to the masses, and He really was, I want you this morning to be reminded of that,
[time=897] He was committed to the masses. He spent time with them. He was willing and ready to teach them.
[time=901] He was willing and ready to heal them in large settings. He was willing and ready to stand on the side of a mountain
[time=907] and encourage them and exhort them. While He was willing to be with the masses, He was deeply devoted, my friends, to the smaller setting.
[time=917] A smaller community of followers.
[time=921] A smaller community of disciples that He transparently lived and shared His life with.
[time=929] While He did engage the many, He poured an enormous amount of heart and energy into the few.
[time=937] And you see that as you read through the Gospels, there's Jesus with the many. There's Jesus with the masses, but then there's Jesus with the twelve.
[time=944] And not only the twelve, at times there would be Jesus with the three.
[time=949] And there was even the one that Jesus loved, the one.
[time=954] I mean, you can make a really good case for the fact that He went from the masses down to the one.
[time=959] But there was in that picture this distinct and powerful commitment to the smaller setting.
[time=967] I want you to think about this for a moment. I think this is helpful.
[time=971] It was good to go through this first hour with the folks at nine o'clock.
[time=975] I want you to think, like, really think now with me on this one and begin in your minds to imagine the power of imagination.
[time=983] What it must have been like to be a part of Jesus' small group.
[time=990] I mean, you couldn't have asked for a better small group leader, amen?
[time=994] So Jesus has this huge commitment.
[time=997] I mean, when it's time for Him to do His thing and the three years of public ministry comes, yeah, He's on the mountainside, but He's also over here investing in some guys and some gals.
[time=1006] I mean, there was the twelve, but there was also a group of folks that went with Him wherever He went.
[time=1011] And think about this morning what that must have been like.
[time=1014] And as you think with me about what it must have been like, think about how, if it were you, what you would have seen and what you would have learned and what you would have experienced.
[time=1023] They traveled together.
[time=1026] You understand that?
[time=1028] You read through the Gospels and you realize that Jesus and those who were with Him in His small community, they went from village to village.
[time=1038] They went from city to city.
[time=1040] They went from region to region.
[time=1042] They're going north.
[time=1044] They traveled together.
[time=1045] Road trip.
[time=1046] You've been on them.
[time=1047] You know what it's like to travel with people and to travel with them a lot.
[time=1051] You understand the dynamic that takes place.
[time=1053] These guys traveled with Him frequently.
[time=1056] They found lodging together.
[time=1058] They ate together.
[time=1059] They shared meals together.
[time=1061] Oftentimes they slept on the ground together.
[time=1064] Faced opposition together.
[time=1066] It's worthy to note right there that as they went from city to city or village to village or region to region, the reception wasn't always warm.
[time=1074] It wasn't as if wherever they went folks were always glad to see them.
[time=1078] Sometimes they weren't.
[time=1079] And sometimes the reception not only was cold, sometimes it was demonic.
[time=1084] Sometimes they encountered demonic attacks.
[time=1087] Sometimes the reception they received was one filled with hatred and demons.
[time=1096] They faced opposition together.
[time=1098] They taught and served together.
[time=1100] Think about that.
[time=1101] Think about being in that small group.
[time=1104] Traveling around living and sharing your life intimately with Jesus Himself.
[time=1109] Think about the day that you and those in the group served the fish and the bread.
[time=1114] Think about what that must have been like.
[time=1118] To just be hustling your tail off back and forth.
[time=1121] He's over here, Brian.
[time=1122] There's more fish.
[time=1123] There's more bread.
[time=1124] There's these thousands of people in the meadow and on the hillside.
[time=1128] And you're just sitting there looking at this thing, transpire going, "Oh my goodness." And you're serving and you're serving and you're giving the bread and giving the fish.
[time=1136] And then you're all done and then there's more left over and you're just absolutely amazed at what you've been able to see and experience right there in that small community.
[time=1144] They wrote in boats, walked down dusty remote trails together.
[time=1149] They prayed and worshiped together.
[time=1151] They saw demons cast out together.
[time=1153] They watched Jesus heal and make new.
[time=1156] The sick, the disease, the dying and even the what?
[time=1159] The dead.
[time=1160] They watched Him in community.
[time=1162] They were with Him as He raised people from the dead.
[time=1167] All that taking place together.
[time=1170] And in time, and in time they did the same together.
[time=1176] They experienced the miraculous.
[time=1179] They got baptized in the spirit together.
[time=1182] Acts, very beginning.
[time=1183] Up in that room, huddled together, waiting.
[time=1185] Jesus said, "Go wait for the helper whom I will send." So there they are, all huddled together.
[time=1191] Waiting for the helper and together the helper comes and together in community and relationship and closeness and proximity.
[time=1198] They get baptized in the spirit together.
[time=1201] They preach their first sermons together.
[time=1203] Experienced jealousy and conflict with each other together.
[time=1207] It wasn't always good.
[time=1210] It was friction at times in their humanness.
[time=1213] They watched Jesus be arrested, tried, tortured, crucified and buried together.
[time=1222] Experienced His resurrection together.
[time=1227] The joy of that, the happiness, the relief of that, all experienced together.
[time=1233] And then, then, together they were told to go and change the world.
[time=1238] Told by Jesus Himself to go and make more what?
[time=1244] Make more disciples.
[time=1246] Told in essence to go and make more disciples who would do and experience all the above together with others.
[time=1254] What a pattern.
[time=1256] What an example He left for them.
[time=1260] What a pattern. What an example He left for you and I to follow after.
[time=1264] Sometimes I think about it this way.
[time=1266] It may work for you, it may not.
[time=1268] It's just something I think of often.
[time=1270] BC.
[time=1272] I think about these guys.
[time=1273] I think about those 12 before community.
[time=1276] Before they were welcomed in.
[time=1279] Before they lived and shared life together with Jesus at an intimate level.
[time=1283] Before all the stuff we just talked about happened, these guys remember?
[time=1287] They were workers.
[time=1289] They were fishing.
[time=1291] One was a tax collector.
[time=1293] I mean, before community, their life looked a certain way.
[time=1297] We saw a few weeks ago how basically they had found themselves in a demographic of young men who were not good enoughs.
[time=1303] Other men had gone on, other young guys had gone on to rabbinical further rabbinical training.
[time=1308] Other guys had been labeled good enough, smart enough, bright enough, sophisticated enough, not them.
[time=1316] Before community they didn't make the cut.
[time=1318] Now after community AC, after living and sharing life together, after living and sharing all that Jesus their rabbi had brought them all that he had invested in them all that they had experienced, they changed the world.
[time=1334] They changed the world and altered the course of human history.
[time=1339] They wrote almost half the Bible, they birthed the church, they died for their faith.
[time=1347] Bottom line, through community, these guys had been transformed.
[time=1355] They had been changed, their lives and their hearts and their souls and their futures and their valley, everything in them had been altered.
[time=1363] Because you see, Jesus was about transformational community.
[time=1369] Life together, being with Jesus and each other, do you hear me?
[time=1374] Being with Jesus and each other, engaged together in a kingdom mission that changed them.
[time=1383] Being with Jesus transformed them. Look at Mark chapter 3, I got to show this to you, I was talking with a good friend this week.
[time=1389] And the simplicity of this passage, the simplicity of really just this one phrase in light of all that we've just looked at in light of all that I've just said, it absolutely blew me away.
[time=1401] Mark chapter 3, here we get this really brief and very concise definition.
[time=1408] This explanation, if you will, as to why Jesus brought the 12 together.
[time=1413] Pretty heady stuff, you want to ask that question?
[time=1415] So why Jesus did you bring the 12 together?
[time=1419] And as you read it, you look there in verse 14 and he appointed 12 so that they could be with him and that he could send them out to preach and to have authority to cast out demons.
[time=1430] And oftentimes when you read that, oftentimes as I've read that, when I think about why he brought the 12 together, what was the purpose of this?
[time=1438] My eyes and I think my mind and my heart immediately go to, well look, he wanted to send him out to preach, it says, and to have authority to cast out demons and they did.
[time=1449] And like I said, that's pretty heady stuff, pretty ominous, pretty huge endeavor there to be giving these guys, but you look at 14 and you realize, wait a minute, I missed one, the first one.
[time=1465] And he appointed 12 so that they could be what, say it out loud, with him.
[time=1473] He brought the 12 together, I know it's basic, but just catch that so that they could be, he knew there would be transformational value in them being with him and he invites you and I to be with each other as we live our lives with him.
[time=1493] It was important to him, biblical community.
[time=1496] Here's a definition for you, I don't think it'll be on the screen, you might want to just jot it down, sharing and living life together, sharing and living life together in a way.
[time=1505] This may be you and five guys, this may be you and four gals, this may be you and seven couples, I mean the smaller setting, it could be anything, it could be an ABF class, it could be a home group on a Thursday night, it could be an accountability deal with you and some buddies on a Saturday morning.
[time=1522] We're talking about these opportunities that God gives us in smaller settings to live and share life together, sharing and living life together, here you go, in a way that is oriented toward the pattern of Jesus.
[time=1535] In a way that is oriented toward the pattern of Jesus, this kind of biblical community my friends is transformational.
[time=1543] And I want to just give you a couple real quick components, there's probably eight, nine, ten, eleven I could think of, I'm going to just give you this morning a few and then I'm going to give you one at the end that I think is absolutely powerful.
[time=1556] Here's a couple, just to start out, some clear components of transformational community, what I mean is you know you're in the midst of, you know that what you're in the midst of has the capacity to be transformational when you're in one of those smaller settings when some of these things are taking place.
[time=1577] Again, we could talk about the study and the taking in of God's word, it's all over the gospels in the book of Acts, clearly a part of transformational community.
[time=1588] We could talk about prayer, we could talk about times of prayer together, on our knees together, we could talk about how Jesus used that and we will talk about it more in the weeks to come with his disciples and those that followed after him.
[time=1601] And there are a number of things we could speak to, here's just a couple real quick, disciples fellowship, disciples who were in transformational community, they fellowshiped with each other.
[time=1614] Write that down, they fellowshiped with each other, Acts 2, 42.
[time=1619] We kind of keep coming back to this and we probably will keep coming back to this as a jumping off point for our discussion on those that followed after Jesus.
[time=1628] It says in Acts 2, 42, they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship.
[time=1637] Ever stopped and just looked at that word?
[time=1640] The disciples in this transformational community, they gave themselves to fellowship.
[time=1647] What does that word mean?
[time=1649] Fellowship.
[time=1652] The word means partner, the word means to share with, to be close to.
[time=1657] Look at Romans, go to Romans chapter 12 if you would.
[time=1662] Go to Romans, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, right after Acts comes Romans 12, go to Romans 12, look at Romans 12, 10.
[time=1671] It says in Romans 12, 10 it says, "Be, and this is," I'm going to show you some passages here where this word, the Greek word for fellowship or the Greek concept for fellowship is used or referred to.
[time=1684] We see it show up here in Romans 12, 10.
[time=1686] Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.
[time=1691] Be devoted.
[time=1693] Be committed to me.
[time=1696] I'm to be committed to you, this you being committed to me and I'm being committed to you and for your commitment to me and mine to you to be wrapped in this thing called brotherly love.
[time=1709] This is the idea of fellowship.
[time=1711] We are in this together and no matter whether you're black or brown or yellow or poor or uneducated or educated, whether you own or rent, whether you lease, whether you're new or I've been around here for 50 years, it doesn't matter who you are, who you know, what you do.
[time=1731] We're in this together and there is this fellowship that we're to experience. It's what disciples experience in community, we are in this together.
[time=1742] Romans 15, just go over a page or two. Romans 15, 5 to 6, I didn't finish Romans 12, 10, sorry.
[time=1749] Be devoted to each other in brotherly love.
[time=1752] Give preference to one another in honor, same idea, same spirit, you before me.
[time=1759] I love you, you matter.
[time=1763] Romans 15, 5.
[time=1765] Romans 15, 5 says now, it says now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus, so that with one accord,
[time=1781] you may with one voice, you get the picture?
[time=1785] Glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1789] Fellowship, my friends, that word in the Greek brings the connotation of unity.
[time=1794] We're one, we have different personalities, we have different preferences, but when it gets right down to it, you're so committed to me and I'm so committed to you and we're so committed to him that we are going to go about this together in unity, harmony.
[time=1810] 1 Peter 4, 9 and 10.
[time=1815] 1 Peter 4, 9 and 10, you can write that down.
[time=1818] It says be hospitable to one another.
[time=1821] Part of fellowship, part of that, that you're committed to me and I'm committed to you and we do that all in brotherly love shows up here in 1 Peter 4, 9, be hospitable to one another without complaint.
[time=1834] As each one has received a special gift, employ that gift in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
[time=1844] So you have been given a gift up there.
[time=1848] By God, you've been given a gift.
[time=1850] You, everybody in this way, you and you, and you, you've all been, if you know him, you've all been given a gift.
[time=1856] A spiritual gift and he gave you that gift to use that gift to minister to me and he gave me a gift so I could use it to minister to you.
[time=1865] And when you use your gift and I use my gift because I want to minister to you and you to me, we all get built up.
[time=1873] And there is in that a sense of fellowship when you don't use your gift or if I don't use mine, the whole thing breaks down and there is none.
[time=1881] Fellowship gets hindered when gifts aren't used.
[time=1888] They fellowship, disciples fellowshiped with each other.
[time=1891] Here's the bottom line.
[time=1892] I just wrote this down.
[time=1893] You know what? They're friends.
[time=1897] We're friends.
[time=1899] We love each other.
[time=1900] We may not get to spend time together.
[time=1902] We may not, you know, do things together every weekend, but because you are who you are and we're committed to who we're committed to and we're a part of this family.
[time=1912] We are friends.
[time=1914] And we treat each other that way.
[time=1919] They broke bread together.
[time=1921] Disciples broke bread together.
[time=1923] Just briefly, something that almost probably everybody in the room, you know, understands that as a church, you know, as a family corporately in this larger gathering, we will once a month remember the sacrifice of our Lord.
[time=1939] And we will remember that by virtue of, you know, kind of how the scriptures guide us to do that.
[time=1946] And we usually, you know, we do that as a family.
[time=1949] But I want to remind you that Jesus broke bread.
[time=1953] Jesus, in essence, you know, led the disciples to communion in the smaller settings as well.
[time=1960] It's a couple of times where we see Him doing that with them.
[time=1963] One really cool time.
[time=1964] If you look in Luke 24, He had already been crucified.
[time=1967] We know that before He was crucified, He led them in an example of communion there in that upper room.
[time=1975] If you look at Matthew, Mark, Luke, go to Luke 24.
[time=1980] If you go to Luke 24, after He's defeated death, a resurrected Jesus interacts with the disciples here towards the end of Luke 24, Luke 24, 30.
[time=1996] Do you see it there? It says when He had reclined at the table with them, He took the bread and blessed it and breaking it.
[time=2004] He began giving it to them.
[time=2008] Corporately and in community, my friends, there is this sweet opportunity God gives us to remember the sacrifice of His Son.
[time=2019] A lot of other places we could go, but I want to just stop here this morning and introduce you to one more.
[time=2023] It may take a little bit of time here to get through this so not bear with me, but enjoy this.
[time=2029] I think this is rich stuff for you and I to think on and contemplate and give ourselves to.
[time=2036] I think this one's very, very powerful.
[time=2038] It has the capacity to do something I think very, very special here among us.
[time=2044] And it's a little risky and I say that because of my own struggle with this discipline, my own hesitancy for years and years and years to really give myself to this specific discipline.
[time=2066] But the more and more I read and the more and more I study and the more and more I live this life and bump into folks, people I'm so thankful for that God sends my way who are further down this road than I am.
[time=2077] And so I glean from them and I learn from them.
[time=2081] I realize how absolutely imperative this discipline is.
[time=2087] My friends, the Scriptures are really, really clear that in this transformational community that Jesus built and in the transformational communities that came after his small group, there was a huge commitment.
[time=2103] Disciples confessed their sin to each other.
[time=2110] Followers of Christ confessed their sin to each other.
[time=2117] It's a number of places we can go to look at this and give thought to it.
[time=2121] I want you to see from the very beginning how it was happening in the movement that Jesus was about.
[time=2127] If you go to Matthew chapter three, you see in Matthew chapter three, this is at the very beginning of what was going on there.
[time=2136] They were baptizing and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, it says.
[time=2141] Jesus is baptizing and they were being baptized by him as they confessed their sins.
[time=2148] Part of baptism in that culture and that time as Jesus gave himself to that and as the disciples gave themselves to that is, people would come, I read about it this week, people would come into the water and there would be a confession there in the water of their sins.
[time=2164] They wanted it to be known, they wanted it to be heard, this kingdom of darkness that they were passing out of into this kingdom of light.
[time=2173] They wanted to, before God and those witnesses, confess their sin and it was public.
[time=2181] There were people listening and they loved him so much and they were so grateful to be in that place, to be able to proclaim their commitment, they confessed it.
[time=2193] If you go to Luke, excuse me, Mark chapter one verse five, you see the same thing and I show you the same thing, but I want you to catch the first couple of lines because it just gives, I think, further credence to the fact that this was a public deal.
[time=2206] And all the country of Judea was going out to him and all the people of Jerusalem and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River confessing their sins.
[time=2221] Wasn't a private deal in a hot tub, all right?
[time=2225] All of Jerusalem and all of Judea.
[time=2230] If you got baptized in a hot tub, I'm sorry, don't take that personally, it's okay.
[time=2235] Point is publicly people were confessing their sin.
[time=2240] Acts 19, turn there if you would.
[time=2244] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, go to Acts 19.
[time=2247] You see in Acts 19, 17 to 20.
[time=2252] Acts 19, 17 to 20.
[time=2258] This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks.
[time=2263] This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks who lived in Ephesus and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.
[time=2274] Many also of those who had believed kept coming confessing and disclosing their practices.
[time=2282] This was in the early church, my friend's commonplace.
[time=2285] People were willing to say, "You know what? I've got it wrong.
[time=2289] I've been where I shouldn't have been. I've been doing what I shouldn't have been doing.
[time=2292] My heart and my mind have been engaged in this and I don't want to do it anymore.
[time=2297] I've come to faith in Christ and I want to not only confess Him, but I want to confess this stuff as well."
[time=2303] There was a willingness in the fire of their faith.
[time=2307] There was this willingness to be transparent and honest and real and authentic.
[time=2313] James 5, 16.
[time=2320] Therefore, everybody read that out loud.
[time=2324] Confess your sins to one another.
[time=2327] There you go.
[time=2328] Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed.
[time=2336] The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish month.
[time=2339] Therefore, confess your sins to one another.
[time=2345] Well, let me say this to you.
[time=2349] It was a Thursday night back in the spring, maybe March, that I experienced in a way that
[time=2366] I never had ever.
[time=2369] I experienced the intersection, if you will, of the confession of sin and the life of a community.
[time=2382] It was one of the most amazing things I've ever, ever taken part in.
[time=2387] I've got some friends here. You're going to meet them in a little bit.
[time=2390] Lloyd and Kate and Steve and even a few others who had in recent months been encouraging me
[time=2398] and our leadership here at Black Haught to consider a ministry opportunity.
[time=2402] And the ministry opportunity that they were encouraging us to consider was something called Celebrate Recovery.
[time=2410] And Celebrate Recovery is a phenomenal opportunity for people who are in the midst of or trying
[time=2419] their best with God's help to recover from addiction.
[time=2423] People who have been lost in their sin, people who have found sin to be a habit in one way, form or another.
[time=2432] Celebrate Recovery is a ministry that gives people who are trying to move away from addiction,
[time=2438] the support and the encouragement and the love and the truth.
[time=2443] It's the unique thing about Celebrate Recovery is that it's a ministry that's founded and based in, absolutely covered by a commitment to help people back toward health based upon the truth
[time=2454] of God's Word and who God is.
[time=2457] And so I'd heard about Celebrate Recovery.
[time=2460] I've known of many places where it's been in existence and I've heard the stories of thousands and thousands of lives
[time=2466] that have been touched and changed and transformed through this thing.
[time=2470] So I wanted to go and observe.
[time=2473] I thought it would be good and they thought it would be good for me if we were thinking about maybe giving ourselves to pursuing it here, they thought you should go.
[time=2481] And so I thought I was just going to observe.
[time=2483] I was going to sit in the back and take a few notes.
[time=2487] Well, so here's what's happened.
[time=2489] So I go out to fellowship on a Thursday night and I walk into a room with about 200 people.
[time=2497] And let me tell you about the room of 200 people.
[time=2501] As I walk in and I'm a little bit late, shocker, I know.
[time=2506] I did slide into a back row seat.
[time=2508] I met Lloyd and Steve and they sat with me and I immediately begin to scan the room.
[time=2514] And what strikes me about this room is the level of authenticity and realness
[time=2521] that you could already sense just being in the room.
[time=2524] Because all the people are in the room, because all the people have admittedly up front,
[time=2531] kind of waved their hand and said, "I got a problem.
[time=2535] I'm addicted to something.
[time=2537] I'm living in a pattern of sin.
[time=2539] I don't want to do it anymore.
[time=2541] It's destructive.
[time=2542] It's killing me and my friends and my family, so I'm here." And by virtue of walking in the door, you lose all your pretense.
[time=2552] You lose all the facade.
[time=2555] I mean, there were people in this room, my friends.
[time=2557] There were guys with coats and ties.
[time=2561] There were guys that came there from downtown.
[time=2565] Coats and ties and $200 shoes, some of the sharpest folks you've ever seen, sitting right there in the front row.
[time=2572] There were moms and there were dads and there were young adults.
[time=2576] And there were folks sitting over here with ankle bracelets on, because they had been told to go by the legal system.
[time=2584] And they were there.
[time=2586] And a lot of them, some of them looked good and some of them didn't look good and some smelled bad.
[time=2594] You understand?
[time=2596] Some were there having barely gotten there that night from the absolute bottom of the barrel.
[time=2604] Some of them sort of kind of looked like they had it together.
[time=2608] Some were young, some were old, some were black, some were brown, some were yellow, some were educated, some were uneducated.
[time=2618] And I was in the first 15 minutes absolutely blown away.
[time=2622] Mostly because in the first 15 minutes they worshiped.
[time=2628] And I sat there in the back row of that room and I listened to that room full of centers,
[time=2636] full of addicts, full of folks with major struggles.
[time=2642] Some of the situations I heard about and some of the folks I even met afterwards, it just, it just boggled my mind, you know, that they were even there.
[time=2652] But they sang.
[time=2653] And let me tell you something, there is absolutely nothing like the worship of a broken,
[time=2660] no more pretense, no more facade, no more faking it, no more sitting in a pew,
[time=2667] hoping to God nobody ever finds out what you do.
[time=2673] There's something about sitting in a room like that and worshiping with people with all the pretense gone, except mine, because I was just there to take notes.
[time=2687] I was just there to observe.
[time=2691] And they sang, and it wasn't real fancy, they had a projector that shot words up on a wall without a screen.
[time=2698] No, no, there was a screen, there was a screen and there was a DVD thing playing, which showed the words up on the screen.
[time=2705] And I'm telling you every single one of them, ankle bracelets to coat and tie, and everybody in between absolutely lifted the roof off that place,
[time=2716] because they were singing to one whom they had experienced in a very, very real way.
[time=2723] And the worship was sweeter than I had ever ever.
[time=2726] And you know me, I've been around for a while.
[time=2728] I've been in a lot of gatherings.
[time=2729] I've sat with thousands of people and worshiped God.
[time=2732] I had never been in a sweeter worship setting than in that room with all those broken, honest people.
[time=2743] And I said to myself, sitting there, you know, in the back row, in the far corner,
[time=2750] I thought to myself, you know what, this, this is church.
[time=2756] At least it's the kind, at least it feels to me like church ought to feel.
[time=2762] And there was this moment where though I was so unbelievably grateful to have been able to be there,
[time=2768] this moment where my heart just broke, because I realized we were in this room.
[time=2775] We weren't in this room.
[time=2778] And that I would go back to a place where week after week after week, we keep walking through doors, hoping to God you never find out what I really struggle with.
[time=2790] Where pretense hasn't been left at the door, where the facade is still up, and we just struggle along doing our best to kind of look like we're supposed to look and do what we're supposed to do.
[time=2803] And I sat there that night in that room just thanking God.
[time=2807] I just thought, "Oh God, I wish I could take this." And then it was so interesting to talk to a gal.
[time=2813] You're going to hear from her in just a moment.
[time=2815] She's a gal from Fellowship who said to me, "You know, one of the great, one of the great ways God's used Celebrate Recovery there at Fellowship is that those folks have come.
[time=2827] And what began with the group that meets on Thursday night down here, and then there's the church that meets down here in the big room on Sundays.
[time=2837] What's been so amazing is to see these people as they grow in their faith and as God does lead them toward wholeness and health, they begin to come and they begin to want to be with.
[time=2848] You know, they don't know any better.
[time=2850] They just think they should be with the family.
[time=2852] And so the family has welcomed them and their authenticity and their lack of pretense has impacted this family and given them the freedom to be more and more the kind of people that God's called them to be.
[time=2867] And so I want to just have you watch this clip real quick.
[time=2870] Rick Hawks and Becky from Fellowship were willing to come by and just shoot a quick clip.
[time=2877] Celebrate Recovery is in a number of churches here in our community and there is a movement afoot these days between the church of Fort Wayne to have Celebrate Recovery opportunities.
[time=2888] Each night of the week, think about that.
[time=2891] Think about people in recovery.
[time=2893] And again, I hope you'll start.
[time=2896] I hope today you'll start thinking of people in recovery as not so much them,
[time=2902] but us.
[time=2904] And we're going to give you a chance in the days to come to think through some of the things that you probably need some help with and some freedom from.
[time=2911] But I want you to think about this.
[time=2913] A place in this community every night of the week, chapel and Fellowship Missionary and Blackhawk and others where folks can come and be encouraged.
[time=2922] They have a gathering and then they break into small groups or further accountability and encouragement takes place.
[time=2929] Roll the clip if you would and Kate and Lloyd and Steve join me up here, would you?
[time=2934] We all have hurts, habits and hang-ups.
[time=2937] Celebrate Recovery is a powerful presentation of how God's Word and the Holy Spirit can give us healing and can give us hope.
[time=2946] Some of us struggle with an addiction to drugs or to alcohol or to sex.
[time=2951] Some of us have more socially acceptable addictions like approval.
[time=2956] But no matter who we are, Celebrate Recovery speaks to the core need of being connected with God in such a way that we can overcome our hurts, our habits and our hang-ups.
[time=2969] I think sometimes there's a stigma of people who are struggling, who have lived really destructive lives.
[time=2975] Whether it's someone that's coming out of the court system or maybe a woman that's dealing with a life of prostitution.
[time=2982] There's often a separation that we create as church people sometimes
[time=2988] of mingling with people and really living out with people who are struggling in different ways.
[time=2994] And it's been so amazing to see folks who have grown up in the church
[time=3000] that are wrestling with real things and maybe see other people struggling as those people to understand they're the same.
[time=3008] And that's been a really neat part of our community growth is to see people, doctors and people who maybe have lost their children
[time=3017] because of harm they've done, share in the same group in the same setting.
[time=3022] And so it's one of those things I think that's been really beneficial to our whole community.
[time=3029] Let me read this to you off the screen if I could.
[time=3032] Just a description of Celebrate Recovery.
[time=3034] Celebrate Recovery is a ministry for all of us who suffer from the struggles of addiction, that stem from life's hurts and the resulting sinful habits that often follow.
[time=3046] If you just take that statement right there, for all of us who suffer from the struggles of addiction that stem from life's hurts and the resulting sinful habits that often follow, that's a lot of us.
[time=3063] More about that later.
[time=3065] It's a program led by average people like you and me who have the life experience needed to share their stories of recovery, their strength and their hope with others in a profound and personal way.
[time=3077] It's a program that brings people together to take off their masks and share their life struggles in a safe and receptive environment.
[time=3085] These people are real with each other and they speak loudly to each other about God's truth and its impact on their own journeys toward wholeness.
[time=3096] I am this morning honored and very privileged to have some friends up here with me.
[time=3101] You guys scoot on over here a little bit. This is Lloyd and Kate and Steve.
[time=3104] Everybody say hi Lloyd, Kate and Steve.
[time=3107] There we go. Lloyd's got the microphone, he's a little nervous, so it helps him if you just interact with him.
[time=3113] I'm honored to have him here because these three stand before you this morning and in essence, as they stand before you, they are saying to all of you
[time=3123] that they're supportive of this ministry.
[time=3126] They long to be a part of it, not only here in Fort Wayne, but here in our own family.
[time=3132] And they love it and they want to be a part of it because it has impacted all three of their lives.
[time=3137] Is that right?
[time=3138] So the three of them stand here today with the guts to say to all of you, we're in recovery. And they love what God's doing in them.
[time=3149] I'm so thankful they've shared it with me.
[time=3151] I've even started to share with them at times some of the things he's been exposing in my own heart and soul. It's been a rich experience for us.
[time=3160] And before we talk specifically about the opportunity that's coming in the months to come, I wanted Lloyd just to share a little bit with you, just briefly Lloyd about your past, some of the struggles that God in his perfect timing and perfect way has freed you from.
[time=3175] Hey, thanks.
[time=3176] You're welcome.
[time=3177] I just want to share that God used the struggle of my alcoholism, my addiction to alcoholism to bring me to the bottom of myself to begin a relationship with me.
[time=3187] I wasn't sure what was going on, but when he did that and I recognized that my life was unmanageable, then he started a relationship with me. They're free to be from my alcoholism.
[time=3197] That's awesome.
[time=3198] As I've listened to you talk about that, it was the freedom from alcoholism that really led him to expose even other things in your heart in life.
[time=3207] Is that true?
[time=3208] Actually, to use that to expose my heart, having an addictive personality, there was some really deep issues in my heart that he wanted to really bring out, and you celebrate your recovery to bring those issues out.
[time=3220] And I've watched Lloyd in his imperfect, human, honest way
[time=3227] over the last several years struggle through, and with God's help and progress in the recovery opportunity that God's given him.
[time=3237] Again, Kate and Steve have been giving themselves to that same process, and it's their hope and our hope as a leadership, as elders, we've met with these guys, and we want to begin to explore what it would be like to provide a night here.
[time=3251] I think we're talking about maybe Friday nights.
[time=3253] Friday nights.
[time=3254] Yeah, Friday nights, maybe being a night.
[time=3256] Can you imagine Friday nights in the life of those trying to work through recovery?
[time=3261] Having a home for them here on a Friday night, and one of the things we want to say to you all this morning is that we need your help.
[time=3268] I think there's going to be some verbiage on the screen, and I want Lloyd to just kind of tell you, we're asking for some initial feedback this morning.
[time=3275] Maybe some of you in the room who would have some experience in this that might want to come alongside these guys and give thought to the leadership process.
[time=3283] Yeah, we're looking for people with 12-step recovery experience.
[time=3286] We're also looking for people that just have a passion for hurting people, that want to come to a -- we're going to have an informational meeting, the 24th at 7 o'clock in room 257.
[time=3297] And we really encourage anybody that has a passion for this to come and see if God can use you in a powerful way to walk alongside other people.
[time=3305] That's awesome.
[time=3306] Anybody for the passion for hurting people?
[time=3309] Anybody in the room, God has through His people and His Word and His Spirit.
[time=3314] God has freed you over the years and given you a new opportunity.
[time=3319] We'd love it if you would, whoever you are, if you'd come and meet with this team, and we will as a leadership continue to give thought to what it looks like to come alongside
[time=3329] and walk through life with people in a very intimate, honest, God-honoring way.
[time=3334] Let me read this to you, and then we're going to close.
[time=3336] Back to confession, which is where this all started.
[time=3340] In confession, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, in a book called Life Together,
[time=3346] in confession the breakthrough to community takes place.
[time=3350] Sin demands, you see, to have a man by himself.
[time=3355] If it withdraws him from the community, the more isolated a person is,
[time=3362] the more destructive will be the power of sin over him, and the more deeply he becomes involved in it.
[time=3369] The more disastrous is his isolation.
[time=3373] Sin wants to remain unknown.
[time=3375] It shuns the light in the darkness of the unexpressed.
[time=3380] It poisons the whole being of a person.
[time=3385] This can happen even in the midst of a pious community.
[time=3389] In confession, the light of the gospel breaks into the darkness and this occlusion of the heart.
[time=3398] My friends, would you stand with us this morning, and let me just encourage you.
[time=3404] Let me encourage you to take advantage of every opportunity you have.
[time=3407] We'd love to help you connect with those in a smaller setting, and we would love our smaller settings, be it an ABF or a home group or an accountability group.
[time=3418] We want those settings to more and more so in the days to come, be marked by a willingness to live life together at a level of honesty, without pretense, willing to confess so that the light of God's Word and the light of God's Spirit can expose things that need to be exposed so that not so that we can embarrass people, but so that we can help and encourage and walk with people.
[time=3439] God, thank you for the morning.
[time=3441] Thank you for the great truth of your Word and thank you for the opportunity that you seem to be giving us in the days to come, to be a place that would have its arms open wide to those in need of help and encouragement.
[time=3454] God, we want to be people who pursue recovery or repentance.
[time=3459] We want to be people who move away from autonomy or addiction and rest in your loving arms, long to embrace us relationally, arms that long to embrace us with the grace and the mercy that only you provide.
[time=3474] God, I pray that we would be a people courageous enough to walk that road with you and others.
[time=3479] In your son's name we pray. Amen.
