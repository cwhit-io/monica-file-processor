[time=325] - Hey everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=327] Once again, my name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving a senior pastor here at Black Hawk, and I am so grateful for these few moments that we have prior to you watching the message.
[time=338] And before you watch today's message, I wanted to get you thinking about a certain phrase, a concept, if you will, and that concept, that phrase, is identity.
[time=349] That's right, identity.
[time=351] We hear a lot about identity these days.
[time=353] We hear about identity theft.
[time=355] We hear about identity crisis.
[time=357] We hear about people or organizations searching for their identity.
[time=362] And I want you to know how very important one's identity is.
[time=367] I want you to understand that when we talk about who you are at a very foundational level, the way you answer the question, who are you?
[time=376] What do you do?
[time=378] When people ask me that, I often say I'm a pastor or I'm a father or I'm a husband.
[time=383] But you see, who you are at the very foundational and core level, what you think yourself to be, the way you view yourself, this is very important stuff because the way I view myself has a lot to do with how I act and how I choose and how I think.
[time=401] And so this morning, I hope that you'll open your heart and your mind to this idea of who it is you really are.
[time=408] And what we've been learning in recent days is that if we've bowed the knee of our heart, if we have surrendered fully, our hearts and our lives to Jesus Christ, and the scriptures say that our identity is a disciple.
[time=424] That we are disciples.
[time=425] We are followers of Jesus Christ and his teaching.
[time=430] And we're followers of Jesus Christ.
[time=432] We're disciples before we're lawyers, or doctors, or machine operators, or nurses, or mothers, or fathers, or even pastors.
[time=444] Who are you?
[time=446] Really, at the very foundation of your life.
[time=450] Who are you?
[time=451] I hope this morning, as we learn more about what it means to be a disciple that you can and I can, along with you, answer that question.
[time=459] I am first and foremost a follower of Jesus Christ.
[time=464] As you answer that, and I hope you can answer it in that direction, as we answer that together, as we learn more about being a disciple and that being our identity, we'll see that there are some things.
[time=476] There are some elemental disciplines that God has given us to pursue and embrace.
[time=482] This is what a disciple does.
[time=484] I'm so thankful for the series and so thankful that we can continue today to share what we've been learning with you.
[time=490] Thanks so much for tuning in.
[time=493] God bless you.
[time=494] Have a great week.
[time=495] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=497] [MUSIC - 188 seconds]
[time=712] (gentle music) - Maybe we'd just take a moment here,
[time=726] and I hope you heard the words of that song, and I hope you sensed its message, and I wanna just give you a moment to just bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=737] Would you do that right where you sit?
[time=740] And I know first hour I just sensed a strong nudge from God to give people the opportunity to do this,
[time=749] having experienced the morning and the great truth that God's put before us, and then the great, great truth of that song, and I just wanna give you the chance there and the quietness of your heart to confess.
[time=763] We talked about doing that last week, and I wanna give you the chance to confess as I've confessed already this morning, the great sin of yearning for and longing for
[time=778] and pursuing other things, other endeavors.
[time=784] Other pursuits besides a yearning and a longing for him.
[time=791] And I would say along with the writer
[time=798] of that song, and I know many of you would, truth be told, there is in many a heart in this room, the longing to learn to yearn for him and him alone,
[time=812] to be passionate, to burn with passion for him, and yet so many times we are distracted, so many times pulled away, so many times enticed by the enemy to yearn for other stuff, and so I wanna just give you the moment to just pray, and to just say to God, oh God, I confess my yearning for other gods, I confess my longing and my pursuits toward other endeavors, God-empty endeavors that leave me empty and longing and yearning for more, and oh God, this morning, would you fill me up?
[time=850] Would you fill me with your great truth?
[time=853] Would you fill me with your word?
[time=855] Would you fill me God with your spirit?
[time=857] And would you remind me this morning God what it's like to be satisfied and to be fulfilled completely in you?
[time=865] Oh God, we wanna yearn, we wanna burn with passion
[time=872] for you and for you alone, and God may it be so.
[time=877] This morning amongst your people and your son's name, we pray amen.
[time=882] All right, elemental, why don't you get your Bibles out, grab a pen, get ready to write some things down, elemental, I wanna invite you back into this discussion that we started weeks ago, a study of really the gospels and the book of Acts and much of the epistles.
[time=899] This is a study, our leadership, our elders and staff have given ourselves two over the last year and a half, and what a kick, it's been for me to share this study with you in recent weeks.
[time=910] What we looked for as we studied the gospels were marks or characteristics, if you will, elements of those that followed after Jesus.
[time=920] Really, what we looked for was the pattern, the example that Jesus left himself, and as we studied, we found quite a pattern, quite an example.
[time=928] And what a joy it's been to try our very best to just take five of those.
[time=932] Again, there could have been 25, it could have been 18, we've just taken five of the traits, five of the characteristics that as we read and studied kind of came to the top again and again and again, elemental disciplines that Jesus himself was deeply devoted to, elemental pursuits that the early church, those that followed him at the very beginning were deeply devoted to, and we've entitled to study elemental, God's design for the life of a disciple.
[time=961] Now, I don't know how in your mind, maybe when you think about what I do or kind of what we do, I'm not sure, when it comes to a message series title, what we put up on the screen, you may think somebody comes up with it on a Friday afternoon before a series is gonna start.
[time=978] It's not how it works.
[time=979] And I wanna just share with you this morning just a few things before we jump into our fourth element, a few things about what you see on the screen, because what's on the screen is there with great purpose and forethought.
[time=991] What's there on the screen wasn't just thrown up there.
[time=994] Elemental, God's design for the life of a disciple.
[time=999] I want you to think about this with me for a moment.
[time=1003] Take that first word to that first phrase, God's design.
[time=1007] I asked him to kind of highlight that word there for just a few moments as I talk about it.
[time=1011] And I want you to think about this with me, my friends.
[time=1014] God, God, God himself, the God,
[time=1021] has a design for your life.
[time=1026] Do we understand that?
[time=1029] God has a design for your life.
[time=1033] Now, some of you have experience in architecture.
[time=1036] Some of you have experience in engineering.
[time=1038] Some of you have experience in that kind of arena and because of how you've been trained and because of what you've experienced, you are absolutely clearly aware of the great benefit of a design.
[time=1051] One that's been carefully thought through.
[time=1053] Others of you maybe haven't had architectural or engineering experience, but you're really smart and you get all that stuff and you see it clearly as day.
[time=1060] Some of you like me haven't had experience there.
[time=1062] You're not very smart, but over time you figured it out through your mistakes and failures.
[time=1068] You've learned like me that a bicycle put together on a Christmas morning freelance.
[time=1075] Forget the paper, forget the directions, forget the design, that bike's not going to be in too good of shape come, oh, 6 p.m. that night.
[time=1085] Let alone a couple of weeks later.
[time=1087] We've learned in life, haven't we?
[time=1090] That when a home is built, when a building is constructed,
[time=1096] when something's put together and it's put together according to the design that that building or that home or that bicycle came with, then when the winds blow hard, when the waters rise, when difficult time comes, when that object be at a home,
[time=1115] a building or a bike is put under the scrutiny of the things that life brings.
[time=1119] Oftentimes it holds up.
[time=1121] Oftentimes it withstands those pressures because it was built according to the design.
[time=1126] My friends, God has a design for your life.
[time=1132] A way your life should be put together, a way your life should be constructed, a way in which your life should function.
[time=1139] A design for your life that when followed allows for optimal durability, stability, longevity, and all of that comes when you and I are willing
[time=1156] to live life and do life according to his design, what we're trying to give you here.
[time=1163] In these weeks that we've been discussing elemental, in this study we've done of Jesus and the pattern that he left and these early followers and the example that they've left, we wanna give you this design that they've left that God gave us a way to live life.
[time=1179] Elemental, God's design for the, what, say it out loud?
[time=1186] The life, is this something else I wanna just mention briefly.
[time=1190] We're not talking about here in this study.
[time=1195] This isn't about God's design for your Sunday experience.
[time=1199] This isn't about God's design for your life at school
[time=1206] when you're with those who believe what you believe.
[time=1208] No, no, no, this isn't a study about God's design for your life, the two or three days a week, you find yourself in the company of people who believe pretty much the things you believe go where you go and do what you do.
[time=1220] This is not about that.
[time=1223] No, my friends, this design that we just talked about is a design for your life.
[time=1228] How much of it do you think?
[time=1229] All of it.
[time=1231] Every single component, every single compartment, every single room of your life.
[time=1245] 24/7, it's an overused phrase, but I like it.
[time=1248] And this, this teaching, these elemental disciplines,
[time=1254] it's not for the two one, I wrote this down this week, I didn't know if it made sense, then I said it first hour and it did.
[time=1259] It's not for the two one, two hours, one day a week, but for the 24/7, 24 hours, seven days a week.
[time=1269] So many times I bump into people who somehow think this is about what happens in here.
[time=1275] And this design, my friends, is for your life.
[time=1281] Every part of it, the way you think, the way you live, the way you choose, every hour of every day, your work hours, your late weekend night hours, and your private hours in the private places where no one's looking.
[time=1298] Elemental, God's design, look at that title again, elemental, God's design for the life of a what?
[time=1306] Say it, a disciple.
[time=1308] And I wanna just make sure we're clear on this.
[time=1311] This design that we're trying to communicate, this picture that we're trying to paint of the life that Jesus lived, this pattern, and these elemental pursuits, these five things that scripture has identified, this is God's design for the disciple.
[time=1331] This is God's design for the disciple, the one who has dropped his nets, if you will, the one who has left everything, and everyone in order to follow Jesus, this is who the design is for.
[time=1345] And I've said this before, I wanna say it again, and I'll say it as lovingly yet straightforwardly as I can say it, God's design is for the disciple and only, only for the disciple.
[time=1357] If you haven't dropped your nets, if you haven't fully and completely surrendered and devoted your heart to him, his design's not for you.
[time=1367] Drop your nets, you're thinking, what do you mean by that?
[time=1370] Well, it's a reference to a passage a few weeks ago.
[time=1372] Look at Mark chapter one.
[time=1374] Look at Mark chapter one, let me just read that to you again, just a powerful picture of how this works when Jesus says, when Jesus invites you and I, when he calls us to follow him, to give ourselves completely to him.
[time=1388] Look how it plays out here in Mark one.
[time=1391] Mark one, 16, as he was going along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea for they were at that time, they were what, say it, fishermen.
[time=1403] And Jesus said to them, follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.
[time=1410] In essence, follow me, and I'm gonna turn you into a disciple.
[time=1414] Immediately, look at that, immediately they left their nets, immediately they dropped their nets and followed him.
[time=1420] And that's the great picture we painted a few weeks ago.
[time=1425] People willing to drop their nets, people willing to love him, people willing to follow him, people willing to value him over and above everything and everyone else in their life.
[time=1434] Design doesn't work.
[time=1440] The design does not work for the one who hasn't fully surrendered heart and life to Christ.
[time=1446] You don't take these five elements.
[time=1451] You don't take God's design for living and try to insert it somehow into a life that hasn't been redeemed.
[time=1458] It doesn't work.
[time=1459] Sometimes it's so frustrating for me.
[time=1465] I mean, frustrating at a heart level, not at like an irritated level, but just sometimes down deep in my heart.
[time=1472] It absolutely just kills me to watch people.
[time=1476] People I know, people I know who haven't, people I know who have not, bowled the knee of their heart to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1486] I watch them and I rub up against them and we're together and I see their lives and I watch as days and weeks and months go by as they stumble and hurt and implode all over themselves and their families and those that they love.
[time=1502] I watch their life without Christ and I want to let times, I want to just wave this, at times I want to lovingly kind of wave his design.
[time=1512] This design we've been talking about.
[time=1514] There's times I want to just wave his design out in front of them and beg them to stop we're getting to an issue of identity here, follow me.
[time=1522] I want to beg them to stop trying to be cool.
[time=1528] I want to beg them to stop trying to be fulfilled, rich, accomplished, pretty, sexy, successful, athletic, smart, powerful, popular.
[time=1539] 'Cause so many of them are just racing after that stuff a thousand miles an hour and I want to just wave his design in front of them and beg them to instead follow Jesus to instead be a disciple.
[time=1553] It would throw them.
[time=1555] Again, the phrase theology is a little different for some, but I hope as we talk about it and as you begin to think it through, you understand what an answer that is, what hope there is and what promise and what fulfillment there is in being a disciple.
[time=1572] Let me ask you right now, let's meet you in the room.
[time=1574] Many of you in the room I know have dropped your nets.
[time=1578] You've given yourself fully to him.
[time=1582] Some of you in the room maybe haven't yet.
[time=1585] And I just want you to know how thankful I am that you're here and how thankful we are that you're engaged in that process and how much it means to us that you're thinking that through.
[time=1596] And I want to just invite you again to a life that you've never ever experienced.
[time=1600] I'm in a place of fulfillment and love and joy and obedience and acceptance in Christ that will transform you and change you.
[time=1609] And as we continue to teach and as we continue to do our best
[time=1615] to allow you the chance to see that life, and the King, our Lord who offers that life, our hope is that you'll come to a place where you're willing to do that very thing, to give your life and your pursuits and your yearning and your longing to him.
[time=1633] You know, sometimes on that same note and again on this issue of identity and who we are and how this is a design for the life of a disciple
[time=1648] in fact, I'll do it this way.
[time=1650] If I just said to you right now, who are you?
[time=1653] Now I'm talking to those of you, many of whom I know, who know him.
[time=1658] And if I was talking to you about your life, just think about your life.
[time=1663] And if I just said to you, who are you and what do you do?
[time=1666] Who are you and what do you do?
[time=1671] It's a common question, you know, we bump into folks, we get into conversations.
[time=1675] Folks, they people ask you, who are you and what do you do?
[time=1678] Take just a moment with the person right next to you.
[time=1681] If you're okay with that, if you're not, then just sit there and that's okay too.
[time=1686] But, you know, break out a little bit.
[time=1689] Have some fun, get a little crazy.
[time=1690] Just with the person next to you or behind you in front of you, just ask them, who are you, who, what, who are you, what do you do?
[time=1699] And you're thinking about everyday life, go ahead with the person next to you, who are you and what do you do?
[time=1704] Go right ahead.
[time=1707] You're a what, you're a what and you do this.
[time=1738] (congregation laughing) The conversation, the conversation kind of goes like, kind of goes like this.
[time=1746] I'm a blank and I do this, you know what I mean?
[time=1750] And here's my point, thanks for doing that.
[time=1753] Here's my point, I know many of you in the room who have bowed the knee of your heart.
[time=1761] You have placed your faith in Christ.
[time=1764] And on the topic of identity and who we are, there's times I wanna wave his design in front of you as well.
[time=1773] There's times I wanna wave his design out in front of you and beg you to stop seeing yourself first and foremost as a, what do you all hear, lawyer, doctor, mom, dad,
[time=1795] machine operator, truck driver, administrative assistant, musician, sales clerk, student, nurse, manager, retail.
[time=1803] I mean, there's times I wanna wave his design out in front of us and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.
[time=1810] Because first and foremost, you're not any of those things.
[time=1815] First and foremost, according to what we've been studying and reading, you are by virtue of your commitment to Jesus Christ.
[time=1823] God's word says that you and I are disciples.
[time=1827] I am a disciple of Jesus Christ.
[time=1830] And what do you do?
[time=1831] I follow Jesus in his teachings.
[time=1833] Now I know we'd get laughed out of the break room.
[time=1835] I know that wouldn't go too well at the ball fields.
[time=1838] But it is a little counter-cultural.
[time=1843] Feels a bit, sounds a bit revolutionary, doesn't it?
[time=1849] And God's word teaches you and I that as those who have placed our faith in Christ, we are disciples.
[time=1855] Now watch this, when you come to that place, when you're really sure about that, when you come to that place, when you're really devoted to that, when you come to that place in your life where you're really okay with and given wholeheartedly to being first and foremost a disciple, a child of God, a follower of his son, then guess what?
[time=1876] Then you get to be a doctor.
[time=1878] And then you get to be a sales clerk.
[time=1880] And then you get to be a mom or a dad.
[time=1882] Then you get to be all that stuff that you do wherever you go each week, wherever I go.
[time=1887] Then all of that begins to make sense.
[time=1890] Because then you get to be a sales clerk or a student or a doctor or a nurse or a machine operator whose very foundation is the fact that they are a follower of Jesus Christ committed to his teachings, living life according to the design that God gave them.
[time=1908] [AMEN] For your information too, I read this this week, the word disciple when characterizing those that followed after Jesus, the word disciple in the New Testament's used 270 times.
[time=1921] The word Christian, how many of you would raise your hand if you would call yourself, if someone asked you, are you a, how many of you would use the phrase Christian?
[time=1930] Raise your hand.
[time=1931] Yeah, we all would.
[time=1932] We've used it for years and years and years and years and years and years and years.
[time=1935] The word, disciple, the word disciple used 270 times.
[time=1938] The word Christian used three times.
[time=1939] Three times in the New Testament.
[time=1944] The New Testament somebody said as a book about disciples, by disciples, for disciples of Jesus Christ.
[time=1951] So let's recap where we've been.
[time=1954] Just real briefly, elemental disciples we learned in our study of the gospels and the book of Acts and most of the epistles we see it everywhere.
[time=1962] We go disciples are devoted to these five things.
[time=1967] Prayerful abiding was where we started.
[time=1969] There's this deep and ongoing commitment to be those who abide in our relationship with God that speaks to intimacy, it speaks to closeness and it speaks to not leaving, not departing, staying fixed like my golden retriever, Laker in the kennel.
[time=1983] Remember just not going anywhere.
[time=1986] I'm staying here with you.
[time=1988] Prayerful abiding, abiding an intimacy that is oftentimes furthered and fostered through the act of and the attitude of prayer.
[time=1997] If you missed any of that, I just, I'd invite you to go online and listen to that message.
[time=2002] You can pick up a DVD, whatever you need to do.
[time=2005] But if you missed it, I would encourage you to kind of get back in there and listen to what we talked about and what we taught that Sunday.
[time=2013] A disciple, a follower of Christ was deeply devoted, as was Jesus himself to the scriptures, element number two, the scriptures, the word of God, our great guide, our great light, our great comfort, our great authority.
[time=2025] And as somebody mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago and it was a great, great point, while not only do we find principles by which to live by in God's word, again, be reminded, my friends, it's in the word of God that we find who, God himself.
[time=2044] It is in the word of God that we go to see our God, to understand better his attributes and his characteristics, his heart and his character.
[time=2054] A disciple is deeply devoted to the scriptures.
[time=2058] A disciple is deeply devoted to transformational community and a disciple, a follower of Christ is so devoted to community living and sharing life together because of the model, because of the pattern that Jesus left for us, because when Jesus came, what Jesus did was he didn't live life alone, he didn't live life as an island, he wasn't detached or separate from intimacy, no, Jesus surrounded himself with a few while he ministered to the many.
[time=2086] Jesus lived in shared life together in an intimate and personal and honest way and in that intimacy and in that honesty and that accountability, those disciples' lives were completely and utterly transformed because that's what happens in community, in biblical community, lives are changed.
[time=2107] And Jesus left for the early church and you see it all through the book of Acts in the early in that first church people living, gathering in large settings, yes, but living intimately and honestly in smaller settings.
[time=2121] I hope you're making an effort these days.
[time=2125] Those of you here in this room, if you're not connected to a smaller setting, you know, we've got those for you, we've got people that would be willing to invite you in to a smaller setting.
[time=2137] We've got a number of opportunities for you on a Sunday morning.
[time=2140] We just started a new community on Sunday mornings first hour.
[time=2145] If you're here today, second hour and you just got up an hour ago, or an hour and a half ago, if you weren't here first hour, maybe you weren't sleeping, but maybe you were getting breakfast, I don't know, but let me just tell you this first hour, there's a new chance for you to be in a smaller setting and the intent of that smaller setting, is to provide practical application to the five elements that we've been teaching on and discussing in our Sunday morning gathering.
[time=2170] Love to get you connected to that, if that would be a desire of yours.
[time=2173] There's other smaller settings around here.
[time=2175] We'd love to get you connected.
[time=2177] God transforms people in smaller settings.
[time=2181] From this morning, we come to our fourth, missional serving, missional serving.
[time=2189] I'm not quite sure what runs through your mind.
[time=2190] When I say the phrase to you, missional serving.
[time=2194] Had some great conversations with people as of late.
[time=2197] And I think the phrase, honestly, I think it does conjure up some questions in the hearts and minds of people.
[time=2203] So this morning I want to take a few minutes and just kind of talk you through that before we jump into the rest of that element.
[time=2212] Let's talk about the word first of all, missional.
[time=2215] I think it's caused some people to just ask some really good questions, missional.
[time=2220] In a conversation recently I had with somebody, they said this, they said if serving, if serving is helping others or meeting the needs of others, then is there a type or form of serving that somehow wouldn't be missional?
[time=2237] They asked.
[time=2238] They in essence asked, is an all service really missional?
[time=2243] And I want to just help you think that through.
[time=2246] I want you to understand what we mean by this because the answer to that isn't all service really missional, is not necessarily.
[time=2253] There can be service that's not missional and really it all depends on how we understand and define this word missional.
[time=2262] You see the phrase, and you can write some of this down if you'd like, the phrase missional speaks first and foremost to the motivation, don't miss this, it speaks to the motivation behind the serving.
[time=2277] Oftentimes we want to talk about what the serving looks like and then give it a definition, no, no, no, no.
[time=2284] We're going to back you up a bit here and get you to think about in here, okay?
[time=2288] So this isn't really something I can just immediately gauge in you, nor you and me.
[time=2294] This is really something that has to do with motivation and it has to do with you and him and what's going on in here and why you do some of the things that you do on the serving front.
[time=2304] We think that's very, very, very important.
[time=2307] It speaks to the motivation behind the serving and at the core level of true motivation, some service, yours and mine can be at time selfish.
[time=2317] You understand that, right?
[time=2319] There can be service that can also be extremely selfish.
[time=2324] Sometimes there can be service that's really only altruistic or humanistic in its purpose.
[time=2331] Let me just explain that briefly.
[time=2334] There's a type of service and I think we've got three things to jot down here.
[time=2339] There is a type of service that can be done.
[time=2342] Here's non-missional serving.
[time=2345] There's a type of service that can be done just to be noticed.
[time=2349] Sometimes you can, sometimes I can.
[time=2353] You know what, I'll just say me for now.
[time=2354] I'll tell you, I'll confess to you this morning that there have been times in my personal and ministry life where I have done things in smaller settings where not a lot of people were aware and there are times where I have done things in very large public settings serving type things where everybody was aware and I did it because I wanted to be noticed.
[time=2377] I did it because I wanted you to think well of me.
[time=2382] I did it because I wanted attention.
[time=2387] There's times in our lives where we do a good thing, serving, but we do it with motivation that's completely whacked.
[time=2396] There is a type of service that can be done
[time=2402] just to be noticed.
[time=2403] There is a type of service that can be done to make one feel better about who, about oneself.
[time=2410] There is a type of service that can be done to simply better or further the human condition.
[time=2419] I was really, really thankful and I mean this because of what I'm capable of.
[time=2426] I was really grateful for the motivation.
[time=2430] I mean, for the most part.
[time=2432] I don't know that we ever do something completely 100% purely, but I'm just saying, I was really grateful for the motivation God gave me and the ability he gave me to manage that motivation with his help on my last trip over to Nairobi.
[time=2449] The chance to be at that orphanage there, that new life and to be with those babies and to work with that staff and to meet with church leaders there in Nairobi, Kenya.
[time=2461] That was an absolute privilege.
[time=2463] And there were some good things going on in my heart as God gave me the chance to do that.
[time=2468] I want you to know I'm not above and it would be very like me in my sinfulness to have gone to Nairobi and held those babies to be noticed.
[time=2480] It would be very much like me and I'm very capable in my sinfulness.
[time=2487] Maybe you are too, I don't know, I won't speak for you.
[time=2490] I could have gone to make myself feel better.
[time=2494] You know, you can go and give yourself to something.
[time=2497] I could have come back, gotten that plane and said, "Phew, there." All right, I fed him.
[time=2503] I held him or I gave him water or we planted food or whatever we did.
[time=2510] There's times in our sinfulness where we can go and it's about feeling better about ourselves.
[time=2515] Look what I did, look what I accomplished, look what we provided.
[time=2519] And I did hold a baby who's probably gonna die in six months and isn't that humanitarian of me?
[time=2530] And look how we furthered the human condition.
[time=2532] We brought medicine and that's a good thing.
[time=2535] But what I want you to understand this morning is that by definition, we want you to see missional serving as a bit different.
[time=2544] Any service motivated by any of the above would be non-missional because missional serving begins with a completely different set of motivators.
[time=2554] Missional service is a service that seeks to make who noticed?
[time=2558] Who, say it louder?
[time=2562] Yeah, it's a serving, but it's not about serving so that you'd notice me.
[time=2567] It's a serving that's done with great humility.
[time=2570] It's a serving that's done in essence very quietly.
[time=2573] It's a service that's done so that God and what's true and right and good will be noticed.
[time=2581] Not you, not me.
[time=2584] You see, missional serving is a service that seeks to help others.
[time=2589] Not me feel better about myself.
[time=2591] No, missional serving helps others feel better both physically, both physically and spiritually.
[time=2599] Missional serving, missional service is a service that I love this, that improves or furthers, not the human condition necessarily.
[time=2609] I mean, I think that's involved in it, but ultimately, again, at the motivational level, I'm doing this because I get to partner with my God in furthering his kingdom.
[time=2622] And I've come to this place where I finally get it.
[time=2627] I've come to this place where I finally understand what Tony and I stood here and tried to teach you several weeks ago that in the bigger design of things, in the bigger plan that God has, he has from the beginning and he still is today, and he will be until the very end about this thing called mishpat.
[time=2648] He's about this thing called justice.
[time=2650] He's about this thing that takes what is broken and fixes it.
[time=2655] It's about him taking that which is sick and dying and healing it.
[time=2659] It's about God's great heart and desire to take what's been diminished and to take what's been marginalized and to take what's been cast aside and he brings it back to health and wholeness.
[time=2672] And when we understand that that's God's big design, when we understand that we've been asked to and get to partner with him in that, then our serving isn't just a further humanitarian good, our serving isn't so that we get noticed, our serving is so that God will get noticed and that through our efforts as feeble and weak as they may be, he'll take them and do something redemptive through them.
[time=2700] Does that make sense?
[time=2701] Amen, anybody?
[time=2703] That's it.
[time=2705] So you get to partner with God and he can do something huge when you paint the fence down the street
[time=2716] of the widow lady who hasn't been able to paint it in years.
[time=2720] When you go to Nairobi and hold a baby, when you go down one of these halls and work with three-year-olds, all of a sudden when your motivation is this,
[time=2732] all of a sudden that's a serving that God can use and that's a serving that can bring great glory and honor to him.
[time=2739] Missional serving, with missional serving I'm not just serving because I have to, I'm not serving because good people do so I better.
[time=2747] I'm not serving because this world needs my benevolent humanitarian effort.
[time=2752] No, I'm serving because I'm on the word says it.
[time=2755] I'm on a mission, are you?
[time=2757] Is that how your life has lived?
[time=2761] Are you on a mission, are you living in subjection too and in relationship with your king?
[time=2768] And as your king has charted his course, is that the posture of your life and heart?
[time=2773] I belong to him and I am on a mission from him to help him restore and fix that which is broken whether it's a chance to invest in a three-year-old paint offense, rake some leaves or hold a baby.
[time=2789] That's missional serving.
[time=2791] The king has come to make things new and so I get to partner with him in that endeavor.
[time=2799] Real quickly, write this down.
[time=2800] We're gonna start this this morning and we're gonna finish it up next week.
[time=2804] But I want you to at least sense where we're going.
[time=2806] This is really, really good stuff.
[time=2808] Jesus the disciples and their pattern of serving.
[time=2811] Here we go.
[time=2811] We didn't make up this stuff.
[time=2814] Missional serving comes from our study of Jesus and his disciples and the way they did what they did.
[time=2820] Here you go.
[time=2821] Jesus the disciples and their pattern of serving.
[time=2824] Number one, Christ modeled servanthood for his disciples and demonstrated that people's physical needs provided an opportunity for spiritual ministry.
[time=2837] Two things that we, too many times, keep really, really far apart.
[time=2842] Jesus was a master of bringing together.
[time=2846] He demonstrates that people's physical needs provide an opportunity for spiritual ministry.
[time=2851] Look at Matthew four.
[time=2853] Look at Matthew chapter four.
[time=2856] Turn there on your Bibles, would you?
[time=2858] Matthew chapter four, verse 23.
[time=2864] It says this, read closely.
[time=2868] It says Jesus there in Matthew four, 23.
[time=2871] Jesus it says was going throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom.
[time=2880] Stop right there.
[time=2881] There's some pretty spiritual stuff going on right there.
[time=2884] There's some spiritual endeavor right there.
[time=2887] Jesus going all over the country, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and comma, not a big distinction, just one sentence teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.
[time=2907] Physical and spiritual needs being met, really in essence in one endeavor.
[time=2914] The news about him, look at 24.
[time=2917] The news about him spread throughout all Syria and they brought to him all who were ill.
[time=2923] Watch and see if you notice something.
[time=2925] Those who were ill, those suffering with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics, and he healed them.
[time=2936] Do you notice something?
[time=2939] Who'd they bring to him?
[time=2943] They heard his message.
[time=2946] They'd heard him all over the region.
[time=2948] They hear him proclaiming the gospel.
[time=2951] They hear him teaching great truth in the synagogues and they bring to him, I'm looking at this the other day and I'm realizing they bring to him those who were ill, those suffering with various diseases and pains, ill, disease, pain, epileptic, that makes sense, paralytics, that makes sense.
[time=2972] But look at that word inserted there, demoniacs.
[time=2977] Do they bring to him those who are just physically ill?
[time=2982] Yes or no?
[time=2983] No, they bring to him those who are spiritually sick,
[time=2989] spiritual and physical.
[time=2991] They hear one man, his message, his ministry, the physical and the spiritual, large crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan, I believe in part because of the missional nature, the redemptive activity that touched both spiritual and physical.
[time=3015] Hey, go over to Matthew eight, if you would.
[time=3018] Go just a few pages over, open up your Bibles, go ahead and flip through some pages here with us.
[time=3024] Matthew chapter eight, go to chapter eight verses one to four.
[time=3028] This is just, this is fascinating to me.
[time=3031] This was so exciting to see this in recent days, a story I've read, a passage I've studied for years and years but look this, when Jesus came down from the mountain it says in Matthew eight, large crowds followed him and a leper, physical need, physical disease, a leper came to him and bowed down before him and said, "Lord, Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." And Jesus, I love this, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him saying, "I am willing, be cleansed." And immediately his leprosy, immediately his physical condition.
[time=3075] Is rectified, so many times we stop there.
[time=3079] But look at verse four and Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one, but go now.
[time=3086] Show yourself to the what?" Say it, to the priest.
[time=3090] See that you tell no one but go instead, show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded as a testimony to them.
[time=3101] And here in this moment of physical healing, what Jesus is concerned about is not him telling everybody about the physical public side of this thing.
[time=3111] Instead, Jesus in the midst of this physical healing encourages this guy to spiritually go and worship, to make an offering, to go to the priest.
[time=3121] Because he's always, he's always again and again and again bringing the two together, the physical and the spiritual.
[time=3130] Look at 14.
[time=3131] 14 through 17, same chapter.
[time=3134] Matthew eight, there's so much here.
[time=3137] I can't wait for next week.
[time=3138] We're gonna jump in and kind of keep going with this.
[time=3141] Steve Longbreak and Steve Webster are gonna be with me and together the three of us are gonna get a chance to just kind of continue to show you some things about this pattern of missional serving that is left for us.
[time=3153] Let me give you one more this morning, verses 14 to 17.
[time=3155] When Jesus came into Peter's home, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever.
[time=3163] In verse 15, it says, he touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and waited on him.
[time=3170] When evening came, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed, here we go again, many who were demon-possessed and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were ill, spiritually and physically healing those they brought to him.
[time=3187] This was, watch this, verse 17, this was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet about Jesus himself.
[time=3195] He himself, Isaiah prophesied, speaking of Messiah.
[time=3199] He himself took our infirmities and carried away our diseases.
[time=3206] Jesus was the one Isaiah said, who would come and take away our infirmities?
[time=3217] That a physical reference or a spiritual reference?
[time=3220] Could it be both?
[time=3223] Yes or no?
[time=3225] Yeah.
[time=3226] Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years before, Isaiah says of our Lord and our Savior, the King who we follow, that he would be one who would come and take away our infirmities, both physical and spiritual and carry away our disease.
[time=3244] Our blindness, he did that, how about our lostness?
[time=3249] Amen, he did that.
[time=3252] Christ modeled servanthood, my friends, there's much for you and I to see here in this.
[time=3260] And in his modeling of servanthood, he shows his disciples and demonstrates that people's physical needs provided an opportunity for spiritual ministry.
[time=3272] And that is something that you and I have got to get, we have got to with God's help and with his encouragement, we have got to get that one figured out.
[time=3284] We have got to in the way that we live and the way that we see things as we interact with people, as you and I leave this place in just a few minutes, I want us to be disciples, disciples who follow after the pattern of their Lord, a King, our Savior, who when he interacted with people, the antenna were always up and they were always sensitive to how one situation could again and again lead to another.
[time=3311] How one physical infirmity, how one physical need could lead to an opportunity for you and I in the meeting of the physical need to bless people, to encourage people spiritually, we'll talk more about that.
[time=3326] I hope you'll come back next week, not only will we continue with this teaching on missional serving, but it'll be a Sunday where we get to celebrate new life.
[time=3334] People coming into the waters of baptism to stand here to proclaim their love for the Lord and their commitment to this local body and their desire to be in community with you and I hope you'll be here to celebrate that with us and we'll also remember the sacrifice of our Lord by celebrating communion together and it'll be a real, real special time.
[time=3356] So I hope you'll be here.
[time=3357] Would you stand?
[time=3358] Let me pray for you this morning as we go.
[time=3360] Father God, we would simply ask this morning that in our effort, God, to follow after your son, he has left for us an example.
[time=3373] That word in the Greek means that we lay down a thin piece of paper.
[time=3377] We lay down our lives over his and we trace, it says, we trace around it, leaving a pattern that we can then follow and as we look at your son, as we look at Jesus Christ, Father, we realize that he was one who came not to be served, not to be waited on, but God, he came to serve, to care for and meet the needs of others.
[time=3406] In whatever town he went, in whatever village he was in, as he walked down roads, as he found himself in smaller settings and larger settings, God, we see this example of one who existed to because of his mission and what he was about, God, serve and meet the needs of those who had them, those who had the need, oh, God, may we be sensitive this week to those who have needs.
[time=3433] Would you please, God, would you please raise our antenna?
[time=3436] Would you shift our eyes in the directions they need to be shifted in?
[time=3441] God, would you tune our hearts in the direction that they need to be tuned?
[time=3447] May we walk through this life this week with a sensitivity, God, to the physical needs of others, and may we realize that in our willingness to meet them, we just very well may have the chance to in that engagement, God, in that encounter, point them toward the one who can meet every need and make whole any life.
[time=3471] God, give us the strength and the courage and the vision to do that.
[time=3475] God, may we yearn for you.
[time=3478] May we burn with passion for you.
[time=3481] (upbeat music)
