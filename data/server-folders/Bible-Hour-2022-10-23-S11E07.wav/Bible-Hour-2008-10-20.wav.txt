[time=339] Well, hello again, everybody. Welcome to the Bible Hour. I'm Kelly Bird, Sr. Pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=345] And it's great to be with you this morning as we continue on in our series Elemental, God's Design for the Life of a Disciple.
[time=353] I want to ask you a question this morning before you actually watch the message.
[time=357] And I think it's a question that is so very important for you and for me to ask ourselves.
[time=363] It's important for us to ask ourselves this question individually.
[time=367] And it's very important that we ask ourselves this question as a church.
[time=371] And the question is simply this. What are you making? That's right. What are you making?
[time=377] What are you producing? And I don't mean vocationally. I don't mean at the factory.
[time=383] I mean, in the New Testament, as we read about those that followed after Jesus,
[time=389] as we read about Jesus Himself, we see that spiritually He was very, very committed to making something.
[time=397] And what Jesus made wasn't money. What Jesus made wasn't so much a reputation.
[time=403] What Jesus made wasn't vocational progress. What Jesus made wasn't any of those things.
[time=410] What Jesus made was disciples. Jesus made disciples.
[time=415] And those that followed after Him, they made more. And in Matthew 28, He stands there at the very end of the day when He's getting ready to leave them and go and be with the Father when His time on earth is finally finished.
[time=430] And all of redemptive history is about to unfold.
[time=434] He looks His disciples in the eye and says, "Go make more. Go make more disciples."
[time=441] And it's something for you and I to think about. Are we making disciples?
[time=445] Are our spiritual efforts producing the fruit of discipleship?
[time=451] And I want you to think about your life. I've been thinking about mine.
[time=455] I've been thinking about the life of our ministry. So many times, my friends, we can be distracted.
[time=461] So many times, we can, with great intentions, begin to make other things.
[time=466] And God's Word says that as those who are following after the Son of God, you and I need to be making more disciples. And so I hope this morning, as you think about that, and I hope this morning as we teach and discuss that very issue, I hope your heart will be open. And I hope you, along with me and those here at Blackhawk, would be willing to give real honest thought to that which we're making.
[time=489] God's Word says, "Make disciples." I hope you and I can do that in the days to come in a way that would bring great glory and honor to the Father.
[time=519] [MUSIC - 159 seconds]
[time=707] [APPLAUSE]
[time=714] Hey, it's good to see all of you welcome this morning. It's good to have you here at Blackhawk.
[time=718] So many faces that are familiar to me, and that's a good thing.
[time=725] I've told you before, I look forward to this. I look forward to every week getting to be with this family,
[time=731] and to see so many of you here is encouraging other faces.
[time=734] I don't know, and that's encouraging as well. We're thankful that you're here.
[time=739] You may have come on your own. You may have come with some friends.
[time=742] You may have come by way of the Bible hour. A lot of different ways that folks get here on a Sunday morning, but we're thankful that you're here. There is a guest card in the Pew Rack right in front of you.
[time=752] And as a guest, we'd love for you to fill that out and drop that off at the guest center on your way out this morning.
[time=758] They'd love to meet you, answer any questions that you might have, and even they have a gift for you.
[time=763] And we're really, really thankful to get to spend this time with you.
[time=767] Hey, I want to say something before we get started this morning.
[time=769] A couple of things. First of all, anybody who knows me and anybody who's been around here knows that I don't talk often about my kids in terms of details or, you know, family specifics,
[time=779] but something happened this weekend that I'm just incredibly thankful for.
[time=783] Our son, Russell, who many of you have prayed for, and as I mentioned in an email to all of you a week ago
[time=790] or so, you all have helped raise our kids in many ways.
[time=795] And you all have many of you have been praying for Russell as he's thought through a college decision.
[time=801] He has a great, great opportunity to play basketball in college over the course of the last year and a half.
[time=807] Had 15 scholarship offers from major Division I colleges all over the country.
[time=813] Mom and Dad were a little worried about the all over the country part of that, but we kept our mouths shut and God and Russell together.
[time=822] I'm so proud of how Russell's handled this.
[time=825] He has thought this thing through, prayed it through, and sought wise counsel.
[time=829] And we got to be a part of that, but others in this family were a part of that wise counsel as well.
[time=835] And Friday, he committed to attend and play basketball at Michigan State University for Tom Izzo.
[time=841] And that being about an hour and 40 minutes from our front door, we couldn't be happier.
[time=846] And I know how much it meant to him to come to that place of decision.
[time=850] And he even said to us that while he was willing to go other places, the fact that he'll be so close
[time=856] means a lot to him and that he knows many of you love him and want to continue to support him.
[time=862] And we're so grateful for the relationship you've had with him over the years and we can't wait to see how God will continue to use him.
[time=869] So thank you for your support and your love.
[time=873] Also, it's been just a joy these last few hours, last night my dad and his wife Loretta came into town
[time=879] and we're so thankful to have them with us.
[time=882] I'm going to have dad, would you and Loretta just stand?
[time=885] And would you all welcome my dad and his wife Loretta Berg?
[time=897] I sat in a pew like that for years and watched him do this.
[time=905] And anybody who has ever said to me, "Gosh Kelly, you have a way with people.
[time=914] You have a way of making people that you're talking to feel special.
[time=918] You have a way of making people feel encouraged.
[time=921] You have a way of walking into a room and putting people at ease.
[time=925] I've heard for years people say kind things like that to me and all of that is his fault.
[time=933] I learned all that from him.
[time=935] I watched him do that for years and years with individuals.
[time=939] I watched him do it with groups of people.
[time=942] I watched him do it in churches and I'm so grateful for all that he invested in me and it's great to have you here dad. Welcome.
[time=950] Well, hey, seven weeks ago, we jumped into this series that we're currently in called Elemental. God's designed for the life of a disciple.
[time=960] And seven weeks ago, I tried my best to kind of set this elemental thing up like this.
[time=965] I said, "Here's the deal. You've been running. You've been on a long walk.
[time=969] You've been working out and you're thirsty. You're thirsty and you need you long for your thirst to be quenched.
[time=978] And when you long for your thirst to be quenched, when I long for my thirst to be quenched, what we need is the substance known as water." We did a little chemistry lesson that day if you'll remember.
[time=990] The substance known as water is what we need.
[time=994] And what we learned is that you don't get real water to quench your real thirst unless you have the right elements, water, the substance made up of two elements, hydrogen and oxygen.
[time=1007] Well, in the spiritual arena, we realized it was the very same thing.
[time=1010] If you long to see, and many of us in this room do, if we long to see an ignited church,
[time=1017] if we long to see an effective and fruitful church, if we long to be a part of something
[time=1024] that is truly divine and transcendent, that reaches into the very fabric of our culture
[time=1030] and changes it and transforms it, if you long to be a part of an ignited, effective, fruitful church, then you need, just like a thirsty person needs water
[time=1042] in the spiritual realm, you need disciples because disciples are what comprise.
[time=1047] When a church is made up of, when a church is comprised of, when a church is full of disciples,
[time=1056] a church can be ignited, a church can be effective, a church can be fruitful.
[time=1060] And you don't get real disciples just like you don't get real water unless you have people
[time=1066] engaged in the right elements.
[time=1069] You don't get disciples without the spiritual disciplines, the spiritual patterns, the spiritual rhythms established by Jesus Himself left for those who followed after Him
[time=1083] to follow, elements, five elements that we've discovered in our study of the Gospels
[time=1089] in the book of Acts, these elements that when embraced these five elements that when pursued allow us to experience all that God designed for a disciple to experience.
[time=1099] We've called it God's design for the life of a disciple.
[time=1102] We've been through the four elements, the first four already in our study, and today we come to the fifth element.
[time=1109] And let me paint a picture for you if I can that I think will lead us in a powerful way to this fifth element.
[time=1116] Here's how we're going to do it.
[time=1118] Most of you will just identify with this immediately.
[time=1121] Oftentimes at the end of someone's illustrious or prominent career,
[time=1127] we gather up all their stats, all their accomplishments, all their achievements, and we make a very long list.
[time=1134] We like to do that.
[time=1135] We make lists of all the things that people have done and all the things that they've achieved.
[time=1140] Lists that capture their great success and the difference they made in their field of expertise.
[time=1145] We love these lists with athletes will list out their MVP seasons, their personal records, how many times they were all pro, all American, and how many championship rings they have with businessmen or women.
[time=1157] Now entrepreneurs are those in the world of high finance.
[time=1160] We'll talk about how much they made, how many companies they bought and sold, their net worth, stock values, successful mergers and acquisitions over the years with actors or entertainers.
[time=1171] We'll talk about how many Oscars they want, how many Grammys they want, how many Emmys they pocketed, gold records, platinum records, or attendance records for their concerts over the years.
[time=1181] Long lists of the achievements of those that made a difference.
[time=1186] So I'm thinking about that this week.
[time=1190] And I'm thinking this week about the most prominent, most influential, most impactful person who's ever lived.
[time=1200] Jesus Christ, Jesus of Nazareth.
[time=1203] And I'm realizing as I'm looking at his life, this pattern that he has left for us,
[time=1209] this great redemptive story and this great look into the ministry and the life that he lived.
[time=1215] I'm thinking about Jesus of Nazareth and I realized something very profound about his list.
[time=1224] And I realized it wasn't a very long list. I realized in fact that it was very short.
[time=1232] It was a very, very short list. Think about it with me.
[time=1235] He didn't make a dime. You understand that, right?
[time=1239] He didn't make a dime.
[time=1243] He didn't sell or buy anything of significance. He didn't build anything.
[time=1247] Didn't organize any movement or organization.
[time=1250] Didn't write a book, didn't run for office.
[time=1252] Didn't set up a headquarters. Didn't market himself in any way, shape or form.
[time=1256] Didn't hang with the influential or the dignitaries of his day.
[time=1259] The more I read and thought about it, the more I realized that Jesus, when it was all said and done, had really accomplished one thing.
[time=1268] And I'm referring to his time here on earth.
[time=1271] I know he died for the sins of the world.
[time=1274] That's significant.
[time=1276] We'll talk about that more later.
[time=1278] And as it related to his time on earth, as it related to the day to day of his existence,
[time=1284] when you look at everything, when you tally it all up, he did one thing.
[time=1290] Jesus made, what? Disciples.
[time=1297] That's what he did.
[time=1299] Jesus, the Son of God, God in the flesh.
[time=1303] Think about that, with all of redemptive history, right there on the horizon,
[time=1310] with God in his heart and his desire to redeem and reconcile mankind to himself,
[time=1316] with all the earth, with all the people, with all the nations, with all that was involved in that.
[time=1322] You and I could begin to think of complicated and unbelievable plans that God could have construed in his mind to bring about this redemptive movement.
[time=1332] But God sends his son in the form of human flesh to the Middle East and says, "Hey, I want you to invest in twelve nobodies." And that's it.
[time=1343] That was his plan.
[time=1345] Twelve absolute nobodies.
[time=1347] Twelve guys, remember our talk about disciples and Jewish culture and young boys in that day.
[time=1352] Twelve guys that weren't good enough.
[time=1354] Twelve guys that had been told to go home and ply the family trade.
[time=1357] Twelve guys that were tax collectors and fishermen, day laborers doing nothing in comparison to those who lived around them.
[time=1367] As for his days on earth, my friends, Jesus had been used by God when it was all said and done
[time=1373] to completely transform the lives of twelve men.
[time=1377] And then watch this.
[time=1379] And then these disciples, the twelve that Jesus made, were given one, not five, not four, not three, not two.
[time=1388] These guys were given one primary overarching task.
[time=1393] These guys were given one very clear, very significant calling.
[time=1397] And you see it right there in the pages of Matthew 28 verse 19.
[time=1401] Turn there if you would.
[time=1403] Jesus at the end of his time here on earth, giving his disciples one final bit of direction
[time=1410] and instruction and oh, what a final bit of instruction and direction it was.
[time=1415] Matthew 28 in 18 Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, all authority has been given to me in heaven on earth.
[time=1424] It's another way of him saying, listen, what I'm about to say is really, really important.
[time=1429] What I'm about to say is authoritative.
[time=1432] What I'm about to say to you has great scope and significance.
[time=1436] All authority in heaven and earth, by God to his son, all authority had been given to say this next line.
[time=1446] Here you go. This is it.
[time=1449] Verse 19, go. He says, get out of here.
[time=1452] Do not sit still. Do not stand here. Do not hunker down.
[time=1456] Do not stay comfortable. Do not stay in Jerusalem.
[time=1460] Go, he says.
[time=1463] Therefore and make everybody say it out loud.
[time=1467] Everybody say it out loud, a little louder.
[time=1470] How do you go?
[time=1473] Look my friends at the text.
[time=1475] Look at the one thing he told them to be about.
[time=1480] The one thing he wanted them to do, the one thing he wanted them to engage in, the one thing he wanted to be as their priority, the one thing that meant the most, the last thing he tells them, go, make, say it out loud.
[time=1496] I want you to know what he didn't say.
[time=1498] It's important I think sometimes to do that.
[time=1500] Look at what he didn't say.
[time=1502] Think about it with me. He didn't say go make converts.
[time=1506] Did he? No, he said go make what?
[time=1510] Yeah, he didn't say go make attenders.
[time=1513] He didn't say go make Christians.
[time=1515] He didn't say go make supporters.
[time=1517] He didn't say go make theologians. He didn't say go make social activists.
[time=1521] He didn't say go make religious people.
[time=1524] He said people, disciples, maybe even called them by name, go make more of you.
[time=1534] Everything I've tried to do, everything I've taught you, everything you've seen, all that you've learned and experienced, go make more.
[time=1543] Jesus in essence said, hey guys, everything hinges on this.
[time=1547] And I think today my friends, everything still does.
[time=1552] I'm convinced now more than ever, everything hinges on this.
[time=1556] Go make disciples.
[time=1560] He knew then and he knows today that making disciples is what changes and
[time=1566] transforms the world. And I think he knows that today because his 12 did.
[time=1574] They changed and transformed the world.
[time=1577] Now, as I've thought about this a lot in the last couple of months,
[time=1585] and as I've been chewing on this this week especially, it really leads me to ask some very, I think very pertinent, very important,
[time=1594] very at times even difficult questions.
[time=1598] And I'm not going to hold back this morning.
[time=1600] I'm going to share with you those questions.
[time=1604] We'll probably just get to one today.
[time=1607] But we're going to keep moving down this track here in the weeks to come.
[time=1610] So I hope you'll stay with us.
[time=1612] But this leads me to ask and I'll just kind of start with the first one here.
[time=1618] And let me just explain a little bit.
[time=1620] Then we're going to jump into some discussion on this.
[time=1623] Jesus made it really, really clear, my friends.
[time=1627] And the first church in the book of Acts made it really, really clear.
[time=1630] Jesus said, "Go make disciples." You see those that followed after him and you see the church that they were a part of.
[time=1639] And it was ignited. It was fruitful.
[time=1642] Go back to just, let's just do it one more time here.
[time=1645] Go back to Acts 2. I know we've read it before.
[time=1648] I don't mind reading it again and I want to just remind you of what this looks like because this is what happens when disciples comprise a local body.
[time=1659] We could tell you story after story after story of what happens when attenders or pew sitters comprise a local body.
[time=1667] Here's what happens when a church is comprised of disciples.
[time=1671] And they were continually 42, Acts 2.
[time=1674] They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship and to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[time=1682] There you see a commitment to God's Word.
[time=1684] There you see a commitment to transformational community.
[time=1687] Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe.
[time=1689] And many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.
[time=1693] And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common.
[time=1698] And they began selling their property and possessions and sharing them with all as anyone might have need, missional serving.
[time=1708] Day by day they were continuing with one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house.
[time=1715] They were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people.
[time=1724] And to that picture, to that picture, God was adding to their number
[time=1732] day by day those who were being saved.
[time=1735] So Jesus said, "Make disciples." The first church listened and they did.
[time=1742] They made disciples and you see what God did with that.
[time=1746] So here's question number one for us.
[time=1749] For us, you me right here today.
[time=1754] And for us, even as the church.
[time=1757] I think today's discussion is both big picture, big sea church.
[time=1761] Over the last couple, two, three hundred years, you know, I had the privilege and seminary of studying.
[time=1768] And every once in a while we'll go back and look through different church history books and it's an amazing picture.
[time=1774] And in that history of the church, especially the last couple, two hundred years or so, there are some very interesting dynamics that have taken place, very, very pertinent to this discussion we're about to jump into.
[time=1786] So I'm going to ask a question.
[time=1787] Here it is.
[time=1788] Jesus said, "Make disciples." The first church did.
[time=1791] What have we been making?
[time=1799] Because make no mistake, we make something.
[time=1803] We don't make nothing.
[time=1807] We have always and we do today and we always will make something by virtue of how we do what we do and why we do what we do.
[time=1815] We're going to make something.
[time=1817] What have we been making?
[time=1820] Have we been faithful to Colossians 128?
[time=1823] Turn there if you would.
[time=1825] We gave you this verse.
[time=1826] We told you that as elders and staff over the last year and a half, this has been the foundational verse of our study of the Gospels and the Book of Acts.
[time=1834] The elemental series was based on this verse, Colossians 128.
[time=1839] Paul, giving to the church at Colossae, the foundational purpose behind their ministry, says this, "We proclaim Him Christ, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom so that we may
[time=1853] present every man." Everybody say that word.
[time=1857] Complete.
[time=1858] Complete in Christ.
[time=1861] Every man, Paul wanted every man to become a disciple.
[time=1865] Paul wanted every man to grow up.
[time=1867] Paul wanted every person in that ministry to experience the full maturity of being completed in their relationship and walk with Christ.
[time=1876] Have we been about, here's the questions again now, have we been about that?
[time=1882] Has the church been about making disciples?
[time=1885] Has the church been about completing people or has the church been about trying to keep people?
[time=1894] See, these questions begin to be awfully penetrating.
[time=1897] These questions for me personally begin to be awfully personal.
[time=1903] You know what I'll say this, as it relates to Blackhawk, we've made some disciples over the years.
[time=1910] God has been gracious.
[time=1912] God has blessed efforts here at this place for years and years and years.
[time=1917] Many disciples have been made.
[time=1919] Let me be clear on that.
[time=1920] God has used the teaching of His Word.
[time=1922] God has used the people of God and the Spirit of God and through settings like this and smaller settings like the ones many of you are a part of.
[time=1931] Over the years, God has grown up and God has made many a disciple.
[time=1935] That's true.
[time=1937] But, but let me say this.
[time=1940] When I think about, when I personally think about all the people, the enormous number of people that have come through this place in the last 12 years, I've been here 12 years so I can really just speak to, probably should just speak to the timeframes that I feel connected to and responsible for.
[time=1960] And when I think about the enormous number of people in the last 12 years that have come through this place, and I think about the making, the intentional making of disciples, the intentional and purposeful producing
[time=1974] of deeply devoted followers of Christ, sometimes to me personally, it seems to have been more the exception than the rule.
[time=1983] Sometimes it seems to be more unintentional than it was purposeful.
[time=1987] I'm thankful that God did it.
[time=1991] But when I think back over the years too many times, it seems as if it hasn't been as intentional as it should have been.
[time=1999] What have we made?
[time=2004] Well, let me just give you one answer, and this would go back over years and years and years of church history, my friend.
[time=2011] And this also, I think, has to do with things you and I have experienced in recent days here.
[time=2017] Write this down.
[time=2018] I think the church has made consumers.
[time=2021] Write that down, would you?
[time=2022] I think the church has made consumers.
[time=2025] You say, "What's a consumer?" Well, let me just give you a brief definition of a consumer.
[time=2030] A consumer is someone who sees it as their role and their purpose, to come into a worship service, to come into a gathering, to come into even the life of a church.
[time=2041] A consumer is one who sees it as their role and their purpose, to come into the life of a church and continually, not just for a couple of weeks, because for a couple of weeks, whenever anyone comes to a church, they always do this.
[time=2057] But see, a consumer is one who continually tests it out or tries it on.
[time=2064] A consumer is one who sees it as their role and their purpose.
[time=2068] They see themselves as customers.
[time=2070] They see themselves as evaluating the ministry and those that minister.
[time=2076] I hear the word, I've heard it for years, I keep hearing it, I wish I heard it less, but you hear people talking about church and shopping, and they actually talk about church shopping.
[time=2085] People going around from place to place, just seeing if that place and those people have what they want, because over the years, they've grown to see themselves as consumers.
[time=2100] Somebody actually said recently, I read in a book, we've made church about spiritual retail.
[time=2105] We've made church about spiritual retail.
[time=2109] Now there's a reason why the church has made more consumers than they have disciples.
[time=2114] Let me give you a couple of those reasons this morning.
[time=2116] One would be the unbiblical distinction between clergy and laity.
[time=2121] I know it's a lot, but write it down, would you?
[time=2123] The unbiblical distinction, the unbiblical clergy-laity distinction, this distinction that we've made for years and years and years.
[time=2132] And we addressed this in our series a year and a half ago called, "I'm a priest." There is this distinction that's been made for hundreds and hundreds of years between the paid ministry professional.
[time=2144] That would be me.
[time=2146] And there has been this gap, this gulf created between the paid clergy, the paid ministry professional, and the Pew Sitter, the church member.
[time=2157] And what happens is, as long as you continue to support this notion, as long as there continues to be this gap.
[time=2165] And that can be unintentional, that can be intentional, that can be a spoken thing, it can be an unspoken thing, it can be the way you do things in a room, it can be the way you function as a church, but as long as that gap continues to exist.
[time=2179] And people in that place continue to look at the paid professional and the Pew Sitter,
[time=2185] then what happens is this, people in the Pew over time begin to feel as if the paid people do the ministry.
[time=2194] And the people who sit in the Pew receive the ministry.
[time=2198] And the paid people better do a good job of doing the ministry because the customer in the Pew is listening, because the customer in the Pew has an opinion.
[time=2208] Paid people do the ministry and the consumer sits in the room and receives it because it's become all about the customer.
[time=2218] And you know what? Hear me. This is not a slap on the wrist.
[time=2222] This is not me slapping you on the wrist.
[time=2226] This is what leadership has done for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[time=2230] They have allowed this distinction, they have allowed this gap to exist. It's how you've been led.
[time=2238] It's how people in the church have been led for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[time=2242] And I've told you before, there are times where even there's nothing in me at all that resonates with it.
[time=2250] And yet sometimes I feel stuck in it. I told you a year and a half ago there's times I don't like being up here. There's times I walked out here a year and a half ago and I'll do it again. There's times where really just the way we build a room just the way we function in a room. I've said it in recent years, I've said if, and I mean if, I don't plan on it at all, like being with you, I want to be here.
[time=2278] But if, just hypothetical, if I were starting all over again, really I'd build a pole barn and get a piano. And we'd all get coats and bundle up and open the windows in the summer.
[time=2290] If I were doing it all over again, I'd just have a big room in a piano and I'd figure out a way to sit somewhere in the middle.
[time=2298] And I'd just sit on a chair and I'd have my Bible and we'd just figure out a way for everybody to just kind of all be around in one big circle. And I would get to use my gift because don't forget there's a gift issue here because there's gifts that God gave me and there's gifts that God gave you and the gift He gave me was I'm supposed to do my very best to teach you and encourage you and build you up.
[time=2322] And He's given you gifts that you're supposed to use. But somehow some way we get into this, you know, a room like this and you get me up there a stage, even listen to the words, a stage you know, a platform, lights and I'm thankful for the lights because the lights allow us to produce a broadcast that reaches thousands of people and I'm grateful for that. But today I'm just talking about this dynamic, are you with me?
[time=2350] Just the way the room is sometimes continues to support this distinction because you've got people on the stage and people on the stage do.
[time=2362] They perform. So then you get folks like Corbin and you get people like our musicians and our band and our choir and our vocalists who God's given enormous capacity and ability to. And they do that as an act of service to the body but sometimes because they do it on a stage people feel like it's a performance and it's not. It's an offering of worship.
[time=2386] And if Corbin was sitting here next to me, if I had a stool and Corbin had a stool and we had a little piano for him to play and there were no stage and there were no lights, we'd all go, "Now that's great. See that's simple and that's real and that's authentic." But we think somehow that's not authentic and real because there's a bunch of lights and they practice a lot because they want to do well because they want to make an offering to God. You see, sometimes it gets a little confusing.
[time=2414] I don't think we're going to bulldoze this room and put up a pole barn.
[time=2418] So I suppose we're going to kind of just keep at it. You know what I mean? But I hope we can keep at it and we're working on this. We're working on keeping at it in this ministry endeavor in ways that will just abolish, absolutely abolish this distinction between the paid professional and the pew-sitter because you're not supposed to be a pew-sitter, you're supposed to be a disciple. You're supposed to be, as it says in 1 Peter, a kingdom, a body of priests, all of us equally engaged, all of us equally important, all of us equally significant in this effort to be an ignited, fruitful, impactful body of believers. And sometimes the clergy laity distinction has hurt that. We've switched out discipleship for consumerism and in the process, dismantled and sometimes diminished. The church and its effectiveness, and again please hear me. I think that's more of a leadership issue.
[time=2486] That's our fault more than it is yours.
[time=2490] And we're going to keep working on that. There's another reason why the church has made consumers and not disciples and that would be poor ecclesiology.
[time=2498] I know it's a big word, but it's okay. Learn a big word today.
[time=2502] Ecclesiology has to do with church governance. Ecclesiology is how a church is structured in terms of its leadership functions.
[time=2510] And for years and years and years, alright, I'll just address one. I mean there are many ways, there are many aspects to ecclesiology and there are many ways that churches have been governed and led over the years. I'll just speak to one this morning that had a huge impact on the making of consumers versus the making of disciples.
[time=2534] And that is a form of governance called Congregational Rule.
[time=2538] Congregationally led. You hear it talked about in a lot of different ways. I grew up in churches.
[time=2546] I remember sitting with my dad in annual business meetings. I remember them. A lot of them weren't a lot of fun.
[time=2554] A lot of them got really, really uncomfortable.
[time=2558] I've served in churches that were functioning under this Congregationally led Congregational Rule model where basically the way it boils down is the membership those who are members have a vote. And for hundreds of years, again this isn't just about us. We're not structured in this way today. But I can think back, I can read back in my books and I can think back to my own experience and my friends we for in the church, we have voted for years.
[time=2590] We have voted. We have voted on everything.
[time=2594] For years and years the way it worked was you were a member and you voted.
[time=2598] You voted on everything from the carpet color to staff, from budgets to bathrooms, from music to missions, from paint to the way a parking lot got put together. And guess what happens?
[time=2610] When people, after, guess what happens to people after years and years and years of voting.
[time=2618] After years and years and years of voting people become evaluators. People become critiquers. People begin to feel entitled. They become consumers. It happens all over again. Now it's just come in from a different angle. They become entitled and they become evaluators, not disciples. They begin to view the church in terms like do I like it?
[time=2642] How many times have you sat there and said that?
[time=2646] Did I like that? Do I like it?
[time=2650] Do I approve of that? Is that acceptable to me?
[time=2654] Because I'm a member. Or is it what I want? Do I like it or is it what I want? And if it's not I'll use my vote or my voice either way to change it because I'm in charge. I have a vote and my church should be done the way I want it.
[time=2674] And that form of governance got fed to the church for hundreds of years and people began to think that was how it should be.
[time=2686] And it really creates quite a dilemma. Watch this because unbiblical, unbiblical clergy lady distinction leads to you all saying, not that you're saying this because I'm really grateful for where we've come on this. We're making progress and I'm really, really grateful.
[time=2706] In general, the clergy lady distinction leads to you all saying to me you do it.
[time=2714] And then the unbiblical ecclesiology then leads you to say and if you don't like how I'm doing it, you'll let me know.
[time=2722] You'll leave.
[time=2726] You'll stop giving. You'll gossip in the hallway about what's not the way it should be according to you.
[time=2734] And it gets really, really ugly. And it's not your fault.
[time=2738] In essence, I'm saying for years and years leadership in the church because of ecclesiology and clergy lady distinction have created an absolute hotbed for consumers to be grown up and birthed and fed and taken care of.
[time=2758] Consumerism is a deadly deal. Think about it. Think if.
[time=2762] Because I don't think this is the case today, but just think if this place was filled with consumers, people who simply thought that your job and your role was to evaluate things that went on, thumbs up when you liked it, thumbs down when you didn't.
[time=2778] Think about this place being filled with folks who saw it as their purpose in life to come in and critique, evaluate, and assess. Think about how that affects serving. Because of the clergy lady distinction and the massive sense of consumerism, what happens so many times as folks sit and they say no I don't want to serve. My role isn't to serve.
[time=2802] People of serving is that of the paid professional or the staff that they hire.
[time=2806] Let them serve, that's their job.
[time=2810] I mean it really gets out there. Think about giving. See you give to something that you're passionate about. People give enormous amount. People sacrificially give to that which they own and love and feel connected to.
[time=2830] But what happens is if you've got a room full of consumers, they're not passionate about it. They don't really own it. The paid people are the ones who are supposed to do it. The paid people are the ones who are rolling their sleeves up on it. They're just evaluators and evaluators don't give. Family give. People unified together in a common cause give. Priests and disciples who have an arm in arm with paid and unpaid are giving themselves to the greatest endeavor of all they give. Consumerism just chips away. Service giving worship. Back to the performance thing.
[time=2874] If you were all a bunch of consumers then so many times consumers come in and they just sit because they're there to be entertained.
[time=2882] They're there to see how good the music is that week.
[time=2886] Instead of walking in through those doors with this anticipation of the privilege that we all have together to participate in this great act of worship together.
[time=2898] So consumerism is a bad deal.
[time=2902] It affects serving, it affects giving, it affects worship. It affects our going.
[time=2910] If, if you were a consumer, you think you'd show up Saturday for the day of caring and roll up your sleeves and rake some leaves for an old widow? You think if you're a consumer you want to spend the money take the time and make the effort to go to an Irobi and hold a dying baby?
[time=2930] You think you want to go downtown Fort Wayne and put soup in a bowl of a guy who hasn't eaten in three days?
[time=2934] No, see consumers aren't moved by that.
[time=2938] Consumers aren't engaged in that. Consumers just want to come in for their 75 minutes. Hopefully have it be what they want it to be.
[time=2946] And off they go to the other compartments of their life of which church attendance is just one.
[time=2954] And that is not your fault. That is our fault to a large degree because that's the very setup that we've given you. And I'm so thankful we're not giving that to you anymore. But understand why there is a battle sometimes. Understand why there is a struggle sometimes as we keep trying to move away from making consumers and instead move toward making disciples.
[time=2982] Real simply put, instead of a clergy-lady distinction there ought to be a body of priests, a community of disciples.
[time=2990] Instead of poor ecclesiology there should be, and I'm thankful there are here today, and there are. Godly elders.
[time=3002] And if you don't believe this, if you question this, if you've got concerns about this then you should voice them and we should have a talk.
[time=3010] We really should. It's a good thing to do if you've got questions.
[time=3014] But I'm telling you from my experience, especially over these last couple, two, three years, there are godly elders who have taken what God's word says in terms of how a church is to be governed. A church isn't to be governed by a vote. God's word says the church is to be governed by godly men who have your best interest at heart and who are engaged in the process of shepherding you and loving you and coming alongside you. And there are today a black-hot godly elders who are leading and loving this place today toward this great endeavor of making disciples. And I couldn't be more thrilled, more encouraged, more excited about where God has us going.
[time=3058] And I'm so thankful that more and more so today we can say we're giving ourselves to making disciples and not consumers or other things.
[time=3070] Amen. Amen.
[time=3074] Fifth element, making disciples. That's the one thing I want you and your family to bump into. You hear me? Making disciples.
[time=3086] This obsession with disciples. This obsession with making them and developing them and encouraging them. It's the one thing I want you and your family to bump into everywhere you go around here. I want you to sense and see and hear that we want to make disciples. That we want to make you a disciple. That we want to make your third grader a disciple. That we want to make you as a young married couple, disciples. That we want to make you as a senior adult, a disciple. Because we're convinced that so much of what we see going on today, so much of the struggle and so much of the dysfunction, so many of the marriages that are falling apart are falling apart because you got two people in the midst of that who aren't disciples. We can make long lists of things that they are, but they're not coming at it from that perspective.
[time=3134] And we could just go right down the line. Parenting. I'm understanding more and more so than in my parenting. If I'm about growing up disciples, that's different than growing up happy kids.
[time=3146] Everywhere you go, everything you hear, wherever you are, inside or outside these four walls as it relates to us, we want you to know that you're going to bump into this more and more and more. And I hope that's encouraging to you. In the weeks to come, let me just say this, in the weeks to come, we'll not begin a new series, we're actually just going to continue this series. And here's how we're going to continue this series. There are, I've been keeping a list for eight weeks. There are so many implications, my friends. All that we've said, there are some implications that have great relevance in your life personally and in our life as a church. And I just want to take the next several weeks, basically between now and December. And we're going to come back and we're going to talk very honestly as a family and look very closely at God's Word. There are some implications if we are going to be an elemental people, if we are going to really pursue individually and as a church, these disciplines and these patterns that Jesus left for his followers, then there are some discussions and conversations that we're going to have to have. And I'm really excited about it.
[time=3218] And I hope you'll be here. Hey, as we go today, 1202, look at that.
[time=3222] Anybody want to say amen?
[time=3226] See, if you were disciples, you'd say, just keep going, Kelly.
[time=3230] Just keep going.
[time=3234] Sorry, I know my dad's hungry.
[time=3238] So I'll be a good son. Hey, I want to ask two disciples, two followers of Christ, good friends and a part of this family. Val and Lily, would you say these come up? And I'll ask all of you to stand quietly, if you would.
[time=3254] I'm going to have Val and Lily come up here.
[time=3258] We are so thankful for what God has allowed Val and Lily to be a part of. Some of you might recognize Val.
[time=3266] Val has been a part of our deaf ministry for a number of years. She has been used by God in this community.
[time=3274] She's been used by God here in this family. She is a speech therapist.
[time=3278] She works with families and individuals and kids and does all kinds of stuff and she's a kingdom gal as she does all of that. And we've benefited from her exercising her gift and passion here. Lily is incredibly gifted on the technology front and is a huge support to Val in this effort. They're going to Chile.
[time=3302] They're not going across town. They're going to Chile. And they're very excited about it.
[time=3306] They leave the 31st and they're going down to a pastor's conference in Chile. Six, seven hundred pastors are gathering there are other speakers and presenters but they've asked Val to come and speak through a translator to all these pastors about the great benefit and potential of deaf ministry and the kind of impact God can have on families and kids through this kind of endeavor. Lily's going to help her out.
[time=3334] We're both very excited and very nervous and Val's not much for public speaking but they're giving her the mic and all those guys are going to get a chance to hear what's on her heart. So we've been talking for a long time and we're never going to stop talking about priests who go.
[time=3350] Priests who disciples who are mobile because God told those guys on that hill, go. Do not sit still.
[time=3358] Do not hunker down. Do not get comfortable. And so we go.
[time=3362] Go across the street, right? We go across town. We go across the country.
[time=3366] Sometimes we go to Chile and we pass God along to others and I just want all of you to pray with me for these gals and I want you to pray with me as we thank God for our day and would you just in a sign of appreciation and support, would you just reach your hand out towards these gals and as if we were just putting our hands on their backs let's pray for them. Father God, we are grateful for Lily and Val.
[time=3390] So thankful for the gifts that you've given them. And thankful God for the way they're choosing to use them. They would both stand here and say that they're broken vessels. They need your help. They need to continue to grow and be stretched. And God, I'm so thankful that they're doing that. God, they're evidencing their willingness to be used by you. I know they love you and I know they want to be an encouragement to those in Chile. So God, be with them as they go. Give them protection and safety.
[time=3418] And God, give them the words to speak and the heart to express as they find themselves with dear brothers and sisters down there. God, we're thankful for our family and we're thankful God for the privilege that you've given us. To be a place that's about one thing.
[time=3434] To be a family that has a really short list.
[time=3438] Got a place where at the end of the day they'll look back at us and say, you know what?
[time=3442] They just basically did one thing. They did everything they could with God's help to make disciples. Young ones and old ones.
[time=3450] Black ones and yellow, red, white ones. Uneducated ones.
[time=3454] Rich ones, poor ones. God help us to be a place.
[time=3458] A diverse community of disciples where all differences are lost in our relationship with you and our mutual love for each other.
[time=3470] God, grow us please in that direction. Thank you for these two gals.
[time=3474] Come back to us soon and allow us the privilege of rejoicing over how you use them. And all the people in the room agreed and said,
[time=3482] [AMEN]
