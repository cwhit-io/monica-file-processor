[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 224 seconds]
[time=262] And everyone who agreed said, "Amen, you may be seated." [MUSIC - 329 seconds]
[time=599] - Amen, good morning, everybody.
[time=617] It's good to see all of you.
[time=618] I wanna just take a, or you wanna say good morning back, go ahead.
[time=622] Thank you, it's great to see you.
[time=623] I wanna just, if I can, just steal a couple more minutes.
[time=627] I'm so grateful for what Corbin shared, and I'm so thankful for the way in which he did it.
[time=631] I have been struck in recent days by the fact that so many times in a political atmosphere, like the one we find ourselves in, so many times the response of the church, so many times the response of those who follow after the king, capital K, I think too many times, the posture and the response is one of detachment.
[time=652] I've heard from too many places, and I've heard too many folks, kingdom people, capital K, believers, who seem to think that somehow in times like this, our best posture is one of disassociation, almost a apolitical approach, and while I think some people think that to be maybe highly spiritual, I think the scripture paints that out to be highly unbiblical.
[time=674] God has a lot to say about the way you and I would conduct ourselves, the way you and I would think, and the way you and I would act in a time like this as it relates to issues, like the ones we're facing these days on the political scene.
[time=690] I think this morning, if you'll just give me a moment, I want to read some things to you that just made a lot of sense to me this week.
[time=695] I pass them along to you just by way of reminder, if it encourages you, I'm thankful.
[time=700] If it convicts you, I think that's a good thing.
[time=703] If it raises questions and you're hard in mind, I'd be happy to talk with you about it, but I found it to be very, very true.
[time=708] I found it to be extremely appropriate for this time.
[time=711] And let me just share a couple of things with you.
[time=713] I do think there is a place for you and I in this discussion.
[time=717] I think there is a posture that you and I should bring to it.
[time=721] And I think it's important that we understand what God's word says.
[time=724] Let me just say a couple of things here.
[time=726] First of all, let me preface what I'm gonna read by asking you if you would have turned to Matthew 22.
[time=732] I want you to see here what it says in the Gospel of Matthew.
[time=737] Matthew 22, turn there.
[time=739] If you've got your Bibles this morning, I want you to open up them and see it there for yourself.
[time=744] In Matthew 22, it's an interesting context.
[time=746] The leaders of that day, the Pharisees, are plotting against the Lord.
[time=752] And in essence, what happens in this passage is that they're trying to get Jesus to kind of trap himself.
[time=759] They're wanting Jesus to address this issue of how one lives in Jesus' mind, how he would want people to live in both the political and spiritual arena.
[time=769] And they think they're gonna trap him and yet he comes away with a very clear, very concise statement for each and every one of us, I think, to consider and give thought to.
[time=779] Matthew 22, 15 and the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap him in what he said.
[time=786] And they sent their disciples, interesting, the word we've been talking about for weeks now, they have their disciples as well.
[time=794] They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians saying, "Teacher, or Rabbi, "we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God "in truth and deferred to no one, "for you are not partial to any.
[time=809] "God's the most important thing in your book," they're saying.
[time=813] You have elevated God, you are all about God, you are about the spiritual.
[time=818] So they said to him, "Tell us, then, what do you think?
[time=822] "Is it lawful to give a poll tax to Caesar or not?" What are you gonna do, they said?
[time=829] You're all about God, you're all about the spiritual.
[time=832] Well, what do you say about paying taxes to Caesar?
[time=836] And many of you know the response of our Lord.
[time=839] Jesus perceived their malice and said, "Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?
[time=843] "Show me the coin used for the poll tax." And they brought him a denarius.
[time=848] And he said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription "is this as he held up the coin?" And they said to him, "Cesar." Then he said to them, "Then render to Caesar "the things that are Caesar's and to God "the things that are God." Jesus here in this passage gives us a really clear roadmap on how you and I are to navigate this often difficult roadway.
[time=873] He says, "In essence, be supportive of your government." And I want you to think with me just a moment about supporting our government.
[time=883] I want you to think with me just for a moment this morning about what it looks like for you as you give thought to your posture, your attitude, your mindset toward this whole issue of our country and our government and the way in which you and I view it and interact with it and think about it.
[time=900] I wanna take you back just for a moment.
[time=902] I read this and was really, really profoundly impacted by it.
[time=906] Listen, just for a moment, July 4th, 1776, Philadelphia.
[time=911] Our founding fathers, as many of you know, signed a document declaring our independence from the tyranny of those who would enslave the minds, the souls and the lives of men.
[time=923] But what many Americans don't realize is that with the same document, we not only declared our independence from Great Britain, we just as strongly in that very document declared our dependence upon Almighty God.
[time=938] For the declaration of independence begins by proclaiming that we are subject only to the laws of nature and that nature's God.
[time=947] And some of you in the room might remember how it ends.
[time=951] It ends with these words with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence.
[time=957] We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.
[time=964] Some of you know what the word reliance means.
[time=968] The word reliance means dependence.
[time=971] The signers of the declaration were staking everything on God watching over them and seeing them through in their struggle for freedom with a firm reliance upon the protection of divine providence.
[time=986] Now, don't miss this.
[time=988] He goes on to say our founding fathers did not believe in the separation of God from government.
[time=994] They believed that this nation was founded by God, protected by God, preserved by God and prospered by God and God alone.
[time=1004] And based on that belief, they were willing to pledge their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor.
[time=1011] They put it all on the line of those 56 men who signed the declaration of independence.
[time=1018] Nine died of wounds suffered during the war, a war in which they fought for the very freedom you and I possess today.
[time=1026] Five were captured and imprisoned and in each case subjected to severe torture.
[time=1031] Several lost wives, children or entire families.
[time=1034] One of the signers lost his 13 children in one brutal attack.
[time=1039] Two wives of the signers were brutalized by British officers all were at one time or another victims of man hunts and driven from their homes.
[time=1050] Twelve signers of the declaration had their homes completely burned, 17 lost everything they owned.
[time=1058] Indeed, these men not only pledged but gave their lives and their fortunes and sacrificed so much in the everyday of their life so that we today could possess freedom.
[time=1071] And they never once, never once went back on their sacred honor.
[time=1077] As we like to sing, God has truly blessed America.
[time=1081] This brings it to you and me and the here and now.
[time=1084] If these patriots willingly laid it all on the line for this nation, can we do more than simply sing patriotic songs, remember the fallen and wave the flag?
[time=1094] We think so.
[time=1096] Jesus himself said so.
[time=1097] And in this text in Matthew 22, 15 to 21, he says all citizens, including his followers, are obligated to support their government.
[time=1109] Render to Caesar, that which is Caesars.
[time=1113] How can we do this?
[time=1114] Just a few things for you to write down.
[time=1116] I thought this was very profound.
[time=1118] Seek God for your government.
[time=1119] Corbin already mentioned this.
[time=1121] I think seek God for your government.
[time=1123] You might want to just write that down.
[time=1125] Paul encourages in 1 Timothy 2, I urge then first of all that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone, for kings and for those who are in authority that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
[time=1143] We just read that.
[time=1144] You just heard that.
[time=1144] This is good and pleases God our Savior who grants our God our Savior who wants all men to be saved and come to knowledge of the truth.
[time=1154] Seek God for your government.
[time=1155] We don't pray that they would continue in their wickedness but we do pray that God would give them wisdom.
[time=1161] Wisdom to lead our nation according to the principles this nation was founded upon.
[time=1167] I love what it says in Proverbs 21.
[time=1169] You might want to write down Proverbs 21-1.
[time=1171] The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord.
[time=1178] He directs the Lord.
[time=1180] He directs it, the heart of a king like a water course wherever he pleases.
[time=1186] Bottom line, the burden for the health of our nation does not rest on the White House or on the State House.
[time=1192] It rests in you and me, on the church.
[time=1196] The Bible says if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves just as we read earlier and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear them from heaven and forgive their sin and will heal their land.
[time=1211] Seek God for your government.
[time=1214] Support your government, write that down.
[time=1216] Would you support your government?
[time=1218] We pay taxes, that's one way that we support our government.
[time=1222] Obviously we could talk for days and days about that.
[time=1225] There's a lot of waste and questionable spending I realize when it comes to the whole issue of taxes but God says clearly.
[time=1232] He says in Romans 13, Paul speaks of the government's responsibility to punish evil doers and instructed this.
[time=1240] He says this is why you pay taxes, Romans 13-6.
[time=1243] This is why you pay taxes for the authorities are God's servants, no authority in place that God didn't put there.
[time=1251] This is why you pay taxes for the authorities are God's servants who give their full time to governing.
[time=1259] Paying taxes is a way that you support but I thought this was important.
[time=1263] You support your government by taking pride in your nation and again sometimes I hear people in the Christian realm talking about patriotism as if somehow what's more important is that we would simply just show our spirituality and let patriotism wane.
[time=1277] Paul says in Romans 13 that we should respect and honor our government.
[time=1281] It's okay in essence to take pride in our country.
[time=1286] Listen to what the Psalmist said in Psalm 137.
[time=1288] The Psalmist proclaimed, if I forget you owe Jerusalem may my right hand forget its skill.
[time=1294] May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth.
[time=1296] If I do not remember you, if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy, it's really okay to be patriotic.
[time=1305] It really is.
[time=1307] Don't let anyone tell you that as a Christian you can no longer be a red blooded American that you shouldn't express appreciation for men and women in uniform.
[time=1316] That you shouldn't get a lump in your throat when you see the stars and stripes waving but you shouldn't stand and sing with a quivering chin and a tear in your eye as this author said, God bless America land that I love.
[time=1329] You can support your government by being patriotic and passionate about all that's gone into it being what it is today.
[time=1336] You can be patriotic and give honor where and when honor is due.
[time=1340] You can take pride in your country as well as pay taxes to your country and in that way support your government.
[time=1346] Thirdly, submit to your government.
[time=1349] Submit yourselves, Peter said, first Peter two.
[time=1353] Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men whether to the king who is the supreme authority or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.
[time=1366] Peter goes on to say later in that chapter that we are to show these authorities respect.
[time=1372] Show proper verse 17, show proper respect to everyone.
[time=1376] Love, the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.
[time=1381] Having said that, let me just mention this to you.
[time=1386] Having said submit to your government, I think it's important to note as it relates to this political discussion that God's word is clear that we are to stand up to our government.
[time=1396] If the government commands what God condemns, just remember that.
[time=1400] If the government commands what God condemns, then you are obligated to disobey the midwives, disobeyed pharaohs command to kill the Hebrew baby boys.
[time=1411] Daniel disobeyed King Darius, when King Darius told Daniel not to what?
[time=1416] Not to pray.
[time=1418] The same Peter who wrote that we should submit to the government's authority and respect the king as the same Peter who boldly in Acts five, when they said to him, hey Peter, John, shut up.
[time=1429] Stop preaching about Jesus.
[time=1432] They said what?
[time=1433] We must obey God rather than man.
[time=1436] Moses, petition pharaoh for the liberty of God's people.
[time=1440] Nathan confronted King David for his sinful actions as a leader, Elijah faced off against King Ahab.
[time=1447] Isaiah condemned moral decay in the culture.
[time=1449] Amos spoke out against the injustice in society.
[time=1453] Daniel pronounced judgment on King Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=1456] There are times when you and I must stand up and let our voices be heard in the same way and persuade our government of the eternal and infallible truth of God's word.
[time=1470] There are times when standing up and speaking is called for.
[time=1474] Lastly, just write this down, select your government.
[time=1478] Select your government.
[time=1479] Let me just say this about voting.
[time=1481] Now there are times in my own experience I would confess to you I have been apolitical.
[time=1485] There are times in my experience where it's just seemed too complicated, too confusing and I've defaulted back to my God's in control.
[time=1493] He's got it all worked out thing and just skipped the whole deal.
[time=1497] But you and I don't wanna do that.
[time=1499] I really don't believe God calls us to do that and I really don't think in a day and time like this that it's the wisest thing for you and I to do.
[time=1507] I was reading here this week on the voting front in the year 2000, maybe you knew this.
[time=1514] In the year 2000, a little over half, 53% of eligible Americans voted.
[time=1520] In the 2002 midterm elections, the numbers were even more staggering, 39% of those eligible to vote in America voted.
[time=1529] 2004, back up to 60%, but the number fell back in 2006 to 40%.
[time=1536] Listen to this, of the self-described evangelical Christians numbering about 70 million, the percentages are worse.
[time=1543] In 2000, only 25% of those 70 million voted while nearly 50% voted in 2004 with the number falling back to about 30% in 2006.
[time=1556] An old proverb says this, "Bad politicians are elected by good people who don't vote." Certainly the Bible says when the godly, Proverbs 29, too, write this down, when the godly are in authority, the people rejoice, but when the wicked are in power, they groan.
[time=1574] My friends, we've learned in recent days that Christ has called us to penetrate our culture as salt and light.
[time=1582] I am not of the opinion that you and I voting is the only way to do that, nor the most effective, but I think it's a way that you and I have an opportunity to speak and to represent what's true and right for you and I to vote according to the values that we hold dear to, the values that we've learned and we believe are present here in God's word.
[time=1604] I would encourage you while voting has a way of penetrating our culture.
[time=1608] Don't forget that raking a yard or fixing a fence or bringing a meal to someone who's hurting is equally, I believe, is powerful.
[time=1619] And I hope that you and I will continue to give thought and attention to these things in the days to come.
[time=1625] But I think it's important that we not sit back.
[time=1627] I think it's important that you and I step forward with a great appreciation for this country that so many have sacrificed for and a deep willingness to represent what's true and right in the way we would vote and in the way we would conduct ourselves in the process.
[time=1642] Well, hey, let me, before we jump into our discussion this morning about elemental and the implications of elemental, I gotta just tell you about the week ahead.
[time=1654] That was an amazing week and not enough time to get into all of it, but I wrote just a couple things down that I wanted to make sure I talked to you about.
[time=1662] First of all, I had the chance yesterday afternoon, just to go and stop by and kind of pay my respects and just share with Rosalind Corn how happy we were that she turned 90 years old this week.
[time=1679] I don't know if Rosalind's here this morning, but Rosalind and Steve Corn, if my memory serves me right, we're part of the original six or so families that came and started Black Hawk years and years ago.
[time=1690] And Rosalind's been a faithful part of this family and Steve was while he was with us and it was so amazing to see family and friends and celebrate a gal's 90th birthday who's been so faithful.
[time=1702] I wanted to just mention that and if you know Rosalind, make sure you say hello to her and congratulate her on 90 years.
[time=1709] Here's the other thing that happened and this was really, really powerful.
[time=1713] I believe it was on, I believe it was on Wednesday.
[time=1718] We had a funeral here, right here in this room.
[time=1721] It was the celebration of the life of Dan Motter and many of you knew Dan and many of you know Faye and it was just one of those things that was just really, really unique.
[time=1734] And I want to just say this to you, Dan and Faye married, I believe 58 years, if I'm not mistaken, 55 years.
[time=1741] And in the 55 years, it was so interesting to hear Faye.
[time=1746] From the time he passed last week to the time we gathered this week, interesting to hear her talk about their marriage and the struggles they had and the difficulties that they endured and the ups and the downs and the challenges and the tears and the hurts and the blessings and I mean just to listen to her talk about 55 years of marriage, 55 years of family, 55 years of kids and a spouse and things that went right and things that went wrong and things that were clear and blissful and stuff that was confusing and difficult.
[time=1789] And so then we gather in here and I had told the pastor Keith and I had the privilege of sharing in the service together and we had gathered with Faye and the kids.
[time=1803] There were three kids, a number of grandkids and we had gathered in my office earlier in the week and I had just encouraged them.
[time=1811] I said, who wants to say something on the day of the funeral and they all didn't think they could and I just reminded them.
[time=1818] I said, you know what, it's one of the greatest joys that people get when others who have experienced life and have great thoughts and great memories and great gratitude for one who has lived well when those people are willing and they didn't want to cry and they didn't want to make fools of themselves and they didn't want to embarrass themselves and it's a very difficult thing to do, I know, but I just told them, I would really encourage you to maybe just give thought to write in a few things down and honoring your dad.
[time=1850] And so as it went, they thought about it and I showed up that morning, saw the program and sure enough, they're listed on the reflections part, every one of the three kids and all four grandkids.
[time=1865] And I just want you to know that I sat right down here with Keith and I listened to three grown two guys and a gal, mid-50s, all the way in the late 40s, mid-40s,
[time=1882] three grown kids and then four grandkids.
[time=1887] I listened to them talk about a man who wasn't perfect, but I listened to them talk about a man who was faithful, a man who kept at it, a man who didn't give up, a man who when he was faced with difficulty as a dad kept at it, a man who loved God deeply, a man who when he struggled with his wife was faithful to make sure they got it right and moved on.
[time=1912] I listened to these grown and they all wept, they all just broke down on the podium and they're handing Kleenexes to each other and the grandkids get up and they wept and they couldn't get through it and they just talked about their grandpa and the efforts that he made and the notes that he wrote and they talked about the way that he loved him and the way he made him feel special and that just went on and on and on about his deep and growing love for God until the very last day of his life.
[time=1940] And I'm thinking in my mind about the conversations with Faye about all that they had been through and I just want to tell you, it's in moments like that that I want to just grab, you know, I want to grab some of you couples who are struggling and you're thinking about just cashing in your chips, you're thinking there's just no hope and you're thinking it's just not worth it.
[time=1964] It's too hard, it's too demanding, it's too confusing and there's moments like that where I just wish I could have you in the front row and I could just allow you the privilege of seeing what you could look like in 55 years and what that would mean to those that you were raising and what it would mean to those that they'll raise someday for them to look back on your endurance and your perseverance and your willingness to sacrifice and keep at it.
[time=1993] And I'll tell you this and then we'll move on.
[time=1996] It was just struck by it.
[time=1997] The middle son was talking about the difference that his dad had made in his life and you got to realize this was quite a life and there were so many places he could have gone, you know, to illustrate this but here's this 49 year old man standing here at this podium talking about the difference that Dan made in his life as a father and he said the very first thing that came to his mind was an afternoon where Dan picked them up from school and took them for a red pop and a fudge sickle.
[time=2031] And he knew where they bought it and he knew where they drank it and ate it and he remembered what they talked about.
[time=2037] A red pop and a fudge sickle.
[time=2041] An entire lifetime of memories to pull from and a 49 year old man stands here and talks about a simple act of time spent with a red pop and a fudge sickle and a conversation about school and practice and friends.
[time=2060] And it just blew me away all over again of the influence and the impact that you and I get to make in the simplest of ways when we're willing to take the time and make those kinds of decisions.
[time=2072] Wish you all could have been there.
[time=2074] I made a note to myself to videotape all funerals from now on, I don't know if we can do that but boy it was just astounding and so very special and I hope you couples old and young.
[time=2090] I hope that you'll be faithful and I hope you'll stay at it.
[time=2093] Hope you'll ask for help if you need it and I hope we'll never lose sight of all that's at stake and your willingness in mind to be faithful and to stay persistent.
[time=2104] And dads or moms, don't forget how impactful just a few moments is each and every day.
[time=2111] Hey, let me see if I can't jump into some of this this morning, implications of elemental.
[time=2119] Implications of elemental, here's what we mean by this.
[time=2122] We've just concluded kind of a several week discussion of these five elements, very important and remember, remember these five elements aren't a new program.
[time=2132] I didn't go to a conference and hear about them.
[time=2134] I didn't read a book and learn, actually I did read a book, I read the Bible and learned about them, got reminded of them.
[time=2141] We did as elders and staff.
[time=2143] This is not a new deal at Blackhawk.
[time=2145] This is an effort on our part to refocus and re-center and recalibrate, kind of re-dial in our efforts to be the people as individuals and the church as a family that God designed us to be.
[time=2158] And as we've studied, we've realized there are some patterns that Jesus left.
[time=2163] There's a way that he lived, there's a way that he thought, there's a way that he conducted himself and he leaves that pattern, that example for his disciples, those that followed after him and those disciples, especially those in that first church, they embraced those patterns, gave themselves to those elemental pursuits.
[time=2184] God ignited their effort.
[time=2186] God blessed what was going on there and we think it's very related.
[time=2191] So we've looked at in recent weeks, these five elements.
[time=2195] And what I want to tell you this morning is this, we're kind of done, but we're not done.
[time=2198] We're not only kind of not done, we're really in some ways just beginning.
[time=2202] Because of this, if you and I, if, I'll say it this way,
[time=2208] if you individually are going to be serious and truly devoted, like I'm going to try and be individually, to implementing and embracing these five elemental pursuits,
[time=2224] if individually I'm going to begin to practice them at an even deeper, more significant level.
[time=2231] You know what?
[time=2232] I've realized as we've gone through them, there are some things in me that are going to have to change.
[time=2237] There's going to have to be some shifts.
[time=2240] There's going to have to be some things that I'm willing to do differently.
[time=2244] If personally I'm going to pursue the idea of being a disciple, one that follows after the pattern of our Lord.
[time=2252] And then here's the other thing.
[time=2253] If we, if we as a church, if Black Hawk as a ministry is serious about truly trying to embrace these five elemental pursuits, if we as a ministry are going to really truly give ourselves to being a place that not only is comprised of disciples, but makes disciples, then there are some things that we're going to have to, as a family, consider.
[time=2275] There are some implications on the horizon.
[time=2278] And if we're going to pursue this, and I'm here to tell you that we are, we're going to pursue it with everything we have, then there are some things that you and I individually, and as a family, you're going to have to embrace.
[time=2290] And I can't wait to talk with you about these things.
[time=2292] And we'll begin this morning and continue on through the Sundays in November, and I hope it'll be encouraging and challenging and uplifting for you.
[time=2301] I hope it will be clarifying for you as we continue to talk about these things.
[time=2305] Here we go.
[time=2305] Implication number one.
[time=2311] All five elements.
[time=2313] Here's implication number one.
[time=2314] As we look back on our study, I would say it this way.
[time=2317] All five elements are extremely important, but there is one, I believe, that stands out.
[time=2324] I think it stands out big time.
[time=2326] And I'm not here to say one's better than the other.
[time=2328] I'm not saying one's really good and the other four are okay.
[time=2331] They're all unbelievably significant and all vital for your life and mine and for the life of this place.
[time=2337] But as I've thought it through, I think there is one of the five that is really, really significant in terms of the importance that you and I understand it, and you and I give ourselves to it.
[time=2352] And let me explain it to you this way.
[time=2354] Let me get us there.
[time=2356] Just give me a few minutes.
[time=2357] I'm gonna get us to that one element, but let me get us there by asking you if I could just a series of questions.
[time=2363] Could I do that?
[time=2364] Let me ask you a series of questions.
[time=2366] Follow along if you would on your note sheet, and let's just kind of make our way together collectively to this one element that I think stands out in terms of significance and importance from the other four.
[time=2378] Prayerful abiding.
[time=2380] Let's start there, prayerful abiding.
[time=2382] We talked about prayerful abiding in terms of intimacy with God, the intimacy with God that you and I would experience.
[time=2388] Intimacy often fostered by times of prayer.
[time=2393] Intimacy with him, walking with him, abiding with him, not leaving him, but staying with him and staying with him in a personal, intimate, ongoing way.
[time=2402] Under that, here's some questions for you.
[time=2405] Just fill these in.
[time=2406] Do you have a daily plan, you personally, do you have a daily plan for regular prayerful abiding?
[time=2416] I'm asking you, think about that, do you?
[time=2420] Do you have personally a plan for regular prayerful abiding?
[time=2425] Have you established a consistent spiritual rhythm, if you will,
[time=2431] times of prayer and worship for you alone, for you with your family and for you in community?
[time=2438] Is there in your life kind of a regular rhythm where you're experiencing personal times of worship alone, times of worship and prayer with family, times of worship and prayer with those that you're in relationship with in community?
[time=2456] Have you established a consistent rhythm?
[time=2459] Third question, in an independent world, in a very independent world and culture, are you going out of your way as it relates to prayerfulness?
[time=2468] Prayerfulness in the morning, prayerfulness noon, prayerfulness in the evening, prayerfulness in the car, prayerfulness with your kids.
[time=2477] Are you in a culture that promotes independence?
[time=2481] Are you going out of your way to express your dependence on the Lord?
[time=2486] Just some questions for you.
[time=2487] Write them down, we're gonna come back to them.
[time=2489] Stay with me here.
[time=2490] Devotion to God's word.
[time=2492] This was another of the five elements that we've looked at in recent weeks.
[time=2496] Devotion to God's word, an entire life, we talked about an entire life being submitted to, being subjected to, coming under the ultimate authority, the direction and the guidance provided by God's word and God's word alone.
[time=2512] Disciples were devoted to God's word.
[time=2515] Here's a few questions for you, are you personally?
[time=2518] Are you faithfully reading it?
[time=2521] With purpose, with some kind of plan, with some kind of guide, maybe even to help you along with that, maybe this is related back to the presence of a plan for prayerful abiding, are you reading it?
[time=2536] Are you taking in God's word intentionally, in times, with time, to actually think about it and consider it?
[time=2545] Are you memorizing it?
[time=2547] Are you intentionally applying it?
[time=2549] Just three questions, are you reading it?
[time=2550] Are you memorizing it?
[time=2552] Are you intentionally applying it?
[time=2555] Hey, I'm the memorizing front, here's an idea.
[time=2558] If you've got little ones, and if they're here on Sunday mornings, and I hope they are, they're getting verses every week to memorize, and you could jump in on that with them.
[time=2566] You could memorize it with them, you could talk about it with them.
[time=2569] Are you reading it?
[time=2570] Are you memorizing it?
[time=2571] Are you intentionally applying it?
[time=2574] I love this, I read it this week.
[time=2576] How are you, this one author asked, how are you making sure that the scriptures are the loudest, most consistent influence in your life?
[time=2587] It got me thinking about, and this is kind of a confession I would suspect, 'cause it's not always best to do it this way, but maybe you've been there with me in my pain.
[time=2598] You ever been in the car, and it gets really loud, and you're trying to communicate, and you got four or five, six voices going at one time, and oftentimes what I've learned over the years is the loudest voice wins, right?
[time=2611] Not always the best, but I'm just being honest with you.
[time=2613] Sometimes it's the loudest voice that gets through.
[time=2618] Sometimes it's the loudest, most consistent, most persistent loud voice that impacts in the most significant ways.
[time=2627] There's other ways to influence by other than yelling.
[time=2629] We can talk about that later, but my point is this, you and I have a lot of loud, and I mean that literally, and I mean that figuratively.
[time=2638] We have a lot of loud influences in our life, persistent, always there, always coming at us, always communicating, always painting a picture.
[time=2648] There are so many loud influences in your life, and this guy just asked a great question.
[time=2655] Are you making sure that the scriptures are the loudest?
[time=2660] I mean if we're gonna compete, are they the ones, are the scriptures, the loudest influence, the most consistent influence in your life?
[time=2669] Missional serving, we're kind of whittling it down.
[time=2672] You're gonna kind of figure out here which one we're landing on, but just stay with me.
[time=2675] Missional serving, some questions.
[time=2677] In what setting and with whom are you, you individual?
[time=2681] I'm asking you this morning as an individual.
[time=2683] In what setting and with whom are you partnering with God as we talked about just a couple weeks ago, are you partnering with God to restore a broken world?
[time=2694] In what setting and with whom are you partnering with God as God executes his divine plan for justice to fix that which is broken?
[time=2703] In what setting and with whom are you partnering with him?
[time=2708] Whose needs, second question, whose needs are you meeting on a regular basis?
[time=2715] So amazing and so clear.
[time=2716] It's just so blatantly clear as you read through the gospels that Jesus served, partnered with God in this divine plan to fix that which wasn't right.
[time=2727] He served all the time.
[time=2730] Jesus wasn't a once a month server.
[time=2733] Jesus wasn't a periodic server.
[time=2735] Jesus didn't serve just now and then.
[time=2738] Jesus served all the time and he leaves this pattern for you and I to follow.
[time=2746] Whose needs are you meeting on a regular basis?
[time=2749] Listen, both inside, I wanna make sure we say this, both inside and outside these four walls.
[time=2755] Don't forget that while God is so deeply interested in you and I helping restore that which is broken with the hungry and the cold and the sick and the dying, downtown and across the world, he is equally passionate about you and I helping fix that which is broken in the heart of a little five year old just down this hall in Sunday school.
[time=2777] Are you with me?
[time=2779] Not at your head, yes, if that made sense.
[time=2782] Okay, it's a huge call on your life and mine to be servers and I wanna make sure we understand, I was thinking about Janice Marisie and our children's ministry effort.
[time=2792] I know we're coming up on the opportunity for team number two.
[time=2796] Team number one, back in August, September, first time in years, hear me?
[time=2802] First time in years that I didn't stand up here for weeks and beg you all to go help with kids.
[time=2809] I didn't stand up here once in beg because the word got out and Janice's team did a phenomenal job
[time=2816] and people are talking about this around here these days and there was just sign up after sign up after sign up.
[time=2823] They had a full team of people willing to give themselves to the hearts and lives of little ones who need help and encouragement and the truth.
[time=2832] So team two, we're coming up here real soon on a need for a second team.
[time=2837] Maybe some of you on the first team are gonna just stay at it.
[time=2840] Maybe others of you who didn't jump in will give it an opportunity in the weeks to come to go and come alongside some little ones.
[time=2847] Jesus served on a regular basis.
[time=2852] Making disciples, this is where we were last week, making disciples, I didn't get a chance to read to you last week, 2 Timothy 2-2.
[time=2861] Would you turn there real quick?
[time=2863] Making disciples, this was a fourth element that as the elders and staff read through and studied the gospels and the book of Acts and the epistles we saw again and again and again, this huge commitment on Jesus' part to make them.
[time=2879] And then we saw those disciples whom he had made, we saw them making others again and again and again.
[time=2886] And it says in 2 Timothy 2-2, many of you have committed this to memory.
[time=2892] I love what it says in verse one, first of all, you therefore, 2 Timothy 2-1, Paul writing to Timothy, one of his disciples, you therefore, my son, not his son physically, but his son, what, spiritually.
[time=2907] You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
[time=2913] The things, watch this, watch this, four generations of spiritual reproduction about to get articulated here, he says.
[time=2922] The things which you have heard from me, in the presence of many witnesses entrust these things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
[time=2935] That's God's design for your life and mine.
[time=2939] That we would take the things which we have been taught and entrust them to faithful men or women who will in turn entrust them to others.
[time=2948] Paul entrusted them to Timothy who entrusted them to faithful men who in turn entrusted them, it says to others.
[time=2956] That's like it in a nutshell, my friends.
[time=2962] That's what God has left you and I here to do.
[time=2964] I asked you last week, I'll ask you again today, what are you making?
[time=2968] What are you making?
[time=2971] You're gonna make something.
[time=2975] You are making something.
[time=2977] Maybe you're making money and that's okay as long as you're doing what God wants you to do with that money, but I would even say, wait a minute, where's the priority?
[time=2987] Think about it, are you making a reputation?
[time=2990] Are you busy making payments?
[time=2993] Are you making enemies?
[time=2995] What are you making?
[time=2997] God's word says in Jesus' model for us, make disciples.
[time=3001] Here's a question for you, two questions.
[time=3003] Very important, is there someone wiser and more mature passing along God to you in your life?
[time=3010] Is there someone who is discipling you?
[time=3014] Is there someone who's just a little further down the line, spiritually, who is making an intentional and regular investment in your life spiritually and personally?
[time=3024] Is there someone discipling you?
[time=3026] Second Timothy two two and are you, just like second Timothy two two, are you in turn passing along God to someone else?
[time=3034] Who are you discipling?
[time=3036] Who are you making that investment in?
[time=3039] The investment that's been made in you.
[time=3041] My friends, if we're not doing this, if you're answered to these two questions right here, you know, if you're shaking your head, if there's nothing going on here, then we're in trouble.
[time=3052] This is really at the crux of this issue.
[time=3057] Your willingness in mind, our readiness to be discipled and to disciple others.
[time=3065] Prayer for abiding devotion to God's word, missional serving, making disciples, it leads us to the one.
[time=3070] And this is my opinion.
[time=3072] This is my thought for you this morning, transformational community.
[time=3076] Like I said, all five very important, but this one, this one is why, I believe this one, this one stands out to me above and beyond the rest.
[time=3088] And here's why, you being a part of a transformational community is so important because community, my friends, community is the context within which all the other four elements can and should take place.
[time=3102] Community is the context within which all the other four elements can and should be experienced.
[time=3110] All the questions that I asked you, look at your notes sheet there, here's the point.
[time=3114] All those questions that I just asked you this morning, as you thought through those questions, and as you took those notes down, as you thought about a regular time of prayerful abiding, as you thought about your own individual times of worship, your times of worship with your family, your times of worship in community, as you thought about serving and where you're serving and who it is you're serving, as you thought about the consistency with which you're being discipled or discipling others.
[time=3141] I'm here to tell you this, if you look at all those questions and if in your attempt to answer them all, which I think would be a valid endeavor, if the conclusion in your heart and mind is that I will me alone somehow figure out a way
[time=3160] to work through all those questions, you'll fail.
[time=3162] You alone will not, I'm just here to tell you, you alone will not go down that road faithfully and persistently and meaningfully.
[time=3178] Jesus had the chance to disciple 12, not one of them was grown up in their faith in isolation.
[time=3185] It doesn't happen in isolation.
[time=3189] It doesn't work in isolation.
[time=3191] We mature and we get stronger and we get deepened in our faith, we begin to experience great blessing and progress and all those things I asked you about when we're willing to experience those things in community, in relationship with others.
[time=3209] The disciples didn't pray, hear the word or serve alone.
[time=3214] They engaged in the elemental disciplines together.
[time=3217] Here's what I think about when I think of this.
[time=3219] I'm gonna close with this.
[time=3220] Actually, I wanna close with your note sheet.
[time=3225] On the back of your note sheet, I want you to kinda have that ready.
[time=3228] So turn that baby over.
[time=3230] But let me just illustrate it like this.
[time=3232] And maybe you can identify with this picture that I'll just paint real quick.
[time=3236] In our home, Deborah and I with our kids, we have some really, every once in a while, we'll get a really good time around the dinner table.
[time=3247] Everybody there and we're talking about things that matter and we try our best and sometimes we fail miserably.
[time=3253] But there are times when around that table with all seven of us present in the larger setting, if you will, think about this room for a moment in the larger setting, there's times we're at that table.
[time=3264] We have some really good discussions and we feel like we make a little progress in trying to help form Christ in their hearts and help shape their minds and their thinking.
[time=3275] And every once in a while, it goes decent and we're really grateful for that.
[time=3280] Things are started in that discussion with all of us and that's a good thing.
[time=3284] But I'll tell you what, she would say this, I'm standing here and I'm telling you this, as important as that is and as meaningful as those times can be, there is nothing that's as significant and nothing that furthers the discipling process further and more meaningfully than times where I might end up
[time=3308] in the girls, our two oldest girls share a room.
[time=3311] And there might be a time where Deborah finds herself back in that room or I might find myself back in that room a couple hours later that night.
[time=3321] And sometimes with the door shut and me sitting on the floor, leaning up against the dresser and nobody else in there, just me and those two, sometimes questions get asked.
[time=3334] Sometimes we end up having conversations that really, really matter.
[time=3339] Sometimes in a smaller setting, as significant and as meaningful as the larger setting is, sometimes when you're in a smaller setting with someone you trust, where there's a sense of safety and honesty and openness and accountability, sometimes in those smaller settings, God allows us to engage at a place where growth and maturity and life together really, really transpires.
[time=3369] And we're asking, I'm asking today, every one of you in this room and any of you that are watching the broadcast or catching up on a Sunday mist or listening online, if this is home for you, I'm asking you today to please consider we're going to in the days to come do our very best to provide you with opportunities to connect in a smaller setting.
[time=3396] This isn't going elemental.
[time=3399] Our pursuit of making disciples and being disciples and being a place that's ignited by God's hand and His blessing because of those things that we would be about.
[time=3408] It's not going to happen if this is all we do.
[time=3412] You and I have got to be connected in smaller settings, settings that promote intimacy, honesty, authenticity and accountability.
[time=3421] And it may mean a second hour for you.
[time=3423] It may mean a longer Sunday morning.
[time=3425] Maybe it means a living room experience with a small group.
[time=3428] What we've got listed here on this, I want you to look at this.
[time=3431] These are Sunday morning.
[time=3432] These are some Sunday morning and other than Sunday morning opportunities for you to be engaged in a smaller setting.
[time=3438] What's not listed on here are the multiple smaller home group settings that we have and you may be a part of one.
[time=3446] You may be wanting to start one.
[time=3448] But please give some thought.
[time=3450] Please give some thought to being a part of a smaller setting where we can further together what God's doing in you.
[time=3458] It's not going to happen unless you're willing.
[time=3460] And here are some great, great opportunities.
[time=3463] And I hope this morning you'll give some thought.
[time=3465] All of them have information there.
[time=3467] You can call people.
[time=3467] You can email folks.
[time=3469] And if we could be of assistance to anybody in the room, we'd love to help you get connected as we further our pursuit of what God has for you as a disciple, as one who follows after him.
[time=3482] (upbeat music)
