[time=171] The family of man has an album
[time=177] where our names are written beside our brothers and sisters.
[time=186] The events of our lives fill its pages.
[time=190] The family of man has an album
[time=199] where the moments that shape our families' lives are witnessed where sorrows and joys are shared in the pages that bind us together.
[time=215] The family of man has an album an open record before God and man of how we treat one another.
[time=226] And the chapter now unfolding records more Christians being persecuted than at any time in history.
[time=235] More than 200 million Christians worldwide face persecution
[time=243] only for what they believe.
[time=247] What is our response
[time=253] when our children are sold into slavery?
[time=256] What do we say when our sisters are raped?
[time=260] When our sons are imprisoned?
[time=263] When our family members are tortured and beaten to death?
[time=274] The family of man has an album.
[time=278] We'll let remember this as an edge
[time=284] when our family was killed for Christ and we did nothing to help them.
[time=290] We must do what we can
[time=297] and the least we can do is the most we can do.
[time=303] Pray.
[time=306] Now more than any other time in history
[time=312] the church is being persecuted.
[time=314] Over 200 million worldwide believers experience some sort of threat persecution in the face of death for what they believe.
[time=324] Today, if you didn't hear me mention earlier, it's the International Day of Prayer for the persecuted church and we're excited today to partner with churches around the globe, literally, all day today.
[time=336] Praying and interceding to God on behalf of these places where our brothers and sisters are persecuted for what they believe.
[time=344] We're going to get a chance to do that together in a minute but I asked Don Corbett and Tim Marker two elder qualified guys who are here in our church and are currently serving the elder board.
[time=356] I asked if they would just read some scriptures for us this morning that tell us what the truth of the word of God says about this idea of persecution.
[time=363] So just listen as they read and let the truth of the scripture soak into your hearts before we take time to pray.
[time=370] Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves.
[time=375] For the rights of all who are destitute, speak up and judge fairly.
[time=380] Defend the rights of the poor and needy.
[time=384] Rescue those being led away to death.
[time=386] Hold back those staggering towards slaughter.
[time=389] If you say but we knew nothing about this, does not he who weighs the heart perceive it, does not he who guards your life know it?
[time=398] Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.
[time=408] So Peter was kept in prison but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.
[time=414] If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.
[time=418] If one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
[time=422] Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful, and pray for us too that God may open a door for our message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ for which I am in chains.
[time=436] Pray that I may proclaim it clearly as I should.
[time=440] Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and to help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.
[time=452] Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.
[time=463] Pray also for me that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in chains.
[time=476] Pray that I may declare it fearlessly as I should.
[time=479] Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=486] But I tell you who hear me, love your enemies.
[time=491] Do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you.
[time=497] Pray for those who mistreat you.
[time=499] If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also.
[time=504] If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic, give to everyone who asks you.
[time=512] And if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back, do to others as you would have them do to you.
[time=520] But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry, for I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure.
[time=539] I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
[time=545] Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all who have long for his appearing.
[time=558] Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
[time=569] I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
[time=577] I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me.
[time=585] However, I consider my life worth nothing to me.
[time=589] If only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me, the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.
[time=599] The elders in our leadership recently met with a man from China who was visiting here in Fort Wayne.
[time=606] This was back in October I think.
[time=608] His name is Chonke Tong, and Chonke is doing ministry over in China.
[time=613] And he said that he wanted the churches in the U.S.
[time=617] to know that the churches in China are praying for us.
[time=620] Sometimes we see them as the persecuted ones because of the hardship that they face, but Chonke said you don't see yourselves, U.S. Church, as being persecuted, because you see persecution from circumstances rather than from the inhibition of the kingdom moving forward.
[time=640] And sometimes our church in the U.S. is persecuted as we get distracted by the freedoms that we do have and as we get distracted by things other than God and his gospel.
[time=653] And so just be mindful today that it's the church praise that they're also praying for us.
[time=659] I think that's pretty cool to think about.
[time=661] Steve, would you lead us in prayer? Thanks.
[time=666] I was struck just a moment ago, was listen to my wife pray prayers for those that persecute our brothers and sisters around the world, how easy it is for me to pray that prayer when my wife and children sit safely within these walls.
[time=679] And how hard it would be for me to pray that prayer if my wife and kids have been taken away from me, to pray for those that have persecuted my family.
[time=688] You threw them in prison.
[time=692] It's very easy to pray those prayers under these circumstances.
[time=695] And I pray that God would give me the grace to do it in more difficult ones.
[time=701] Paul wrote to Timothy in 2 Timothy 3, probably from the subterranean jail cell, these words in 2 Timothy 3 12, "Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted." Let's pray.
[time=723] This morning Father, we humbly come before you on behalf of your church persecuted around the world.
[time=732] This morning we intentionally join with millions of your children around the world in praying as one body in Christ,
[time=742] individually as members of each other.
[time=745] This morning we join together in praying for the brutalized, victorious bride of your son, Jesus, a bride that is making herself ready for the coming of the bridegroom.
[time=757] As we prepare and adorn ourselves, Father, help us.
[time=762] This morning we pray for the millions worldwide who faithfully serve and minister under governments that have set themselves against you in your gospel.
[time=771] This morning we pray that they will continue to be strong in the face of real and violent resistance to your word.
[time=779] We pray, Father, that those serving in the midst of physical violence will remember that this is not our home.
[time=786] I pray that as they are imprisoned, beaten, tortured, cut off from children's spouses, fellow believers and friends, that they by their faithfulness to you will agree with your Apostle Paul that they would not account their lives of any value or as precious to themselves if only they may finish their course and the ministry that they received in the Lord Jesus to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.
[time=814] This morning, Father, we continue in praying for your church persecuted here in the West. With our brothers and sisters overseas, Father, we pray not that you would deliver us from persecution but that you would equip us by your Holy Spirit to stand strong in the face of it.
[time=831] We ask you, Father, to save us from ourselves.
[time=835] Save us from the persecution that we have visited upon each other as we have fallen short of our calling as the Church of the Living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth.
[time=848] We cannot pillar and buttress, Father, a thing that we have failed to put in place.
[time=852] And so we are persecuted internally by materialism, selfishness, and a failure to live as blameless and pure children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation.
[time=863] We have not, Father, like we should, shown like stars in the universe.
[time=868] Deliver us from evil, Father. Lead us in the everlasting way.
[time=873] Make us righteous. Give us fidelity with our long-suffering brethren around the world who know and understand at a terrible personal price the awful, magnificent, and worthy cost of following Jesus.
[time=888] In an uncertain time, Father, give us perspective as to what we might give to your kingdom's cause.
[time=896] This morning, Father, we commit by your grace to live differently.
[time=900] We commit to you as never before our ministry of reconciliation in this world.
[time=905] Make us instruments of peace. Make us vessels of your love.
[time=909] Empower us to set forth Jesus as the one most precious.
[time=914] Strengthen the feeble hands.
[time=918] Father, study the knees that give way.
[time=921] And may we say with Isaiah your prophet to ourselves and our ill-treated co-laborers.
[time=926] Be strong. Do not fear. Your God will come.
[time=931] He will come with vengeance. With divine retribution, he will come to save you.
[time=938] I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold.
[time=947] I'd rather be his than have riches untold.
[time=955] I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
[time=964] I'd rather be led by his nail-pear stands than to be the king of a vast domain
[time=979] or be held in citrus way.
[time=986] I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.
[time=1002] I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause.
[time=1011] I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause.
[time=1019] I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
[time=1026] I'd rather be true to his holding name than to be the king of a vast domain
[time=1042] or be held in sins, tread swear.
[time=1052] I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.
[time=1071] Thanks, Joe.
[time=1074] This morning, Mr. Cruz is here with us to share from the Word of God, and I'm excited for you to hear what God's put on his heart this morning about ways that we can be Christ-like in regard to evangelism.
[time=1088] Kelly, this morning, is down in Huntington teaching at Union Church.
[time=1094] He taught it last night, twice this morning, and once again tonight.
[time=1097] He's a busy guy this weekend, and I'm sure would appreciate your prayers.
[time=1101] Mitch, would you come, please?
[time=1103] Good morning.
[time=1105] Hi, Mitch.
[time=1107] Oh, there we go.
[time=1109] It's been such a pleasure to be here.
[time=1111] I want to thank you so much for being so warm and kind and generous and to see all the beautiful faces and industry kindles the relationships and how we feel about you inside, and we love you very much and pray for you.
[time=1124] And Susan is here today with me and Kelsey, Lily, and Haley,
[time=1130] and Megan is away at college, and we're still recovering.
[time=1137] Kelly and the elders, and I had been a part of it, had prayed about
[time=1143] what was this pattern we saw in Jesus' life.
[time=1146] And that's how we arrived at these five elements.
[time=1151] Are there five?
[time=1153] There's five elements.
[time=1155] And one of those is making disciples, and Kelly's taught on that.
[time=1159] So Kelly called me and said, "Okay, Mitch, how about implications?" Which would mean, "So what now what?" So if we see this pattern, "So what now what?" And he said, "Would you take a look and help us out on making disciples and knowing your heart, Mitch, do it a little bit on the front end, on the evangelism front, and what that looks like?" And so the question we're going to address today is, have you ever struggled with how you should go to others with the gospel of full surrender to Christ?
[time=1187] Have you ever struggled with how you should go to others with the gospel of full surrender to Christ?
[time=1192] And it might help you right now to actually think of the person in your life, an unbelieving spouse, an unbelieving child, an unbelieving parent, an unbelieving co-worker, an unbelieving friend, whatever that might be, or someone who's maybe just kind of caught in a spot in their lives and they need help.
[time=1208] And you need to go to them with this gospel of full surrender to Christ.
[time=1211] So what I'd like you to get today of the imagery is that every encounter, God's designed it this way, that every encounter with another person is a three-way call.
[time=1221] I've shared this with you before.
[time=1222] Every encounter with another person is a three-way call.
[time=1225] So when we're online with God, we are then connected with someone else,
[time=1231] then they're connected with God.
[time=1233] So if I'm connected with God in a three-way call, and then I connect with another person horizontally, then that person's connected with God.
[time=1240] Do you know what this is?
[time=1244] How do I do it?
[time=1246] Anybody know what this is?
[time=1250] This is an iPhone.
[time=1252] I held--don't text me, Eric.
[time=1255] I held off, and I held off, and I finally did it, and this has changed my life.
[time=1262] In fact, this technical genius guy came to my house, and Eric, I now have mobile me.
[time=1270] And you know what the picture of mobile me is?
[time=1272] A cloud.
[time=1273] So this cloud, and I'm thinking about the Old Testament, and God led them by a cloud, you know?
[time=1278] So I have this cloud over me.
[time=1279] Do you know what this cloud does?
[time=1281] This cloud automatically, in the invisible, automatically syncs my home computer with my laptop, my MacBook, with my phone.
[time=1292] All my contacts, all my calendars, and other assorted things.
[time=1296] That is amazing.
[time=1298] Now, before Eric gets funny, I'm going to turn this off because I know his sense of humor.
[time=1307] So God's designed it so that we would like to live in that cloud.
[time=1313] And every encounter with another human being would be a three-way call.
[time=1317] And so when a person is caught in his sin, he's desiring life apart from God, we tend to go to him and want it to extremes.
[time=1324] Condemingly, if you want to write it down, condemingly, or carelessly.
[time=1330] And both are rooted in a heart of pride expressed in its two forms.
[time=1335] Stone is a condemning heart, and sand is a careless heart.
[time=1341] And in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus offered a different way.
[time=1345] He said to go connectedly, in total humility with the heart of clay.
[time=1351] Humility toward God, and humility toward others.
[time=1357] Whereas pride causes static on the line.
[time=1362] Humility offers a clear connection.
[time=1366] Every encounter with another person is a three-way call.
[time=1368] When we're connected with God and connected with others, they are connected with God.
[time=1372] Whereas pride causes static on the line.
[time=1376] Humility offers a clear connection.
[time=1379] So we're going to look in the Sermon on the Mount on how Jesus described this.
[time=1383] So if you want to stand, we're going to read Matthew 7 verses 1 through 12.
[time=1387] Matthew 7 verses 1 through 12.
[time=1395] Do not judge, or you too will be judged.
[time=1398] For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged.
[time=1402] And with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
[time=1406] Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eyes and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
[time=1414] How can you say to your brother, let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?
[time=1421] You hypocrite.
[time=1423] First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
[time=1428] Do not give dogs what is sacred. Do not throw your pearls to pigs.
[time=1432] If you do, they may trample them under their feet and then turn into pieces.
[time=1437] Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find.
[time=1440] Knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives.
[time=1443] He who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be open.
[time=1448] Which of you if his son asks for bread will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake?
[time=1453] If you then, though you were evil, know how to give good gifts to your children.
[time=1457] How much more will your father and haven't give good gifts to those who ask him?
[time=1462] So, in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this
[time=1468] sums up the law and the prophets. Let's pray.
[time=1473] And so, God may it be so. May we experience you today.
[time=1479] And have it just be almost tangible, God, that we see that every encounter with another person is a three-way call.
[time=1486] That we're designed to be connected with you and really connect with the heart of others so that their hearts will connect with you. Pray this in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=1496] You may be seated.
[time=1499] Jesus called us to go connectedly. Number one, if you want to write it down. Number one, do not go condemningly
[time=1507] to a person who's caught in his sin. Do not go condemningly with a hard heart of stone.
[time=1512] Do not go condemningly with a hard heart of stone. So, do not judge if you want to write it down. Look at verse one.
[time=1518] Do not judge why you will be judged.
[time=1522] Do not judge. Now, look, there are five interpretations of judge from the Greek word that's used here
[time=1528] and it's used in different contexts throughout scripture. The first one would be discern.
[time=1532] Well, Jesus isn't saying do not discern. That means to separate right from wrong, wise from foolish.
[time=1537] He's not saying that because that's a theme from cover to cover is that we should discern.
[time=1540] Next one is judicial litigation. He's probably not saying to not be a judge and don't be a judge in a judicial litigation because in the Old Testament they'd set up judges and they had that system.
[time=1551] Judge can be rewards, kind of like a car show and then they judge and then there's a reward.
[time=1558] He's probably not saying don't do that. But then the fourth definition is guilt.
[time=1564] Do not bring guilt. We're getting closer and really it's probably this fifth definition.
[time=1572] Do not do this. Absolute determination of one's eternity.
[time=1579] Do not make absolute determination of one's eternity when you go to them.
[time=1585] There is only one judge. The Bible tells us from cover to cover and that's God. Do not condemn.
[time=1592] See, stone is legalistic pride. It's a hard heart. It often pretends to connect with God but not with others.
[time=1599] I pretend to connect with God. See, that's the idea there. I'm pretending to connect with God but not with others.
[time=1605] And write this down. A heart of stone tells condemningly. A heart of stone goes to someone and tells condemningly.
[time=1612] And Jesus says why shouldn't you do this? You will be judged in the same way, verse 2.
[time=1616] You will be judged in the same way. He's going to amplify this idea but it's kind of like he's saying you know what?
[time=1622] The sin that you're going with on that condemning heart is worse than the sin this person's got going on in his or her life.
[time=1632] Look what Luke 6, 37, 38 says.
[time=1636] Do not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn and you will not be condemned.
[time=1642] Forgive and you will be forgiven. If you've really been forgiven by God then you're going to be characterized and known as a forgiver.
[time=1649] If you've really received grace then grace is going to be issued out in your relationships.
[time=1654] Next verse give and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over will be poured into your lap.
[time=1660] That's a picture of like a bushel basket of grain. It's shaken and there's no air pockets and it's all packed down and it's completely full and pouring over.
[time=1669] It's completely abundant. It's completely satisfied. For with the measure you use it will be measured to you.
[time=1676] Paul said it this way in Romans 2.1.
[time=1679] You therefore have no excuse you who pass judgment on someone else.
[time=1683] For whatever point you judge the other you are condemning yourself because you who pass judgment do the same things.
[time=1693] I think this could be one of the greatest problems in the organized nonprofit corporation church.
[time=1701] And I think anyone who takes his or her face seriously would struggle with this.
[time=1707] We struggle with it. We start thinking man I earned that from God.
[time=1711] I earned that grace. I earned that forgiveness. Wait a minute it's kind of about me.
[time=1715] And as soon as we go there that stone heart that's manipulating the God of the universe we're trying to make him do something if we do something.
[time=1722] We go to other people and we start looking down on them. We condemn.
[time=1726] Jesus reaches back in his construction days and he comes up with an illustration.
[time=1730] It's so cool that look at verse 3 says why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye.
[time=1738] Verse 4 how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there's a plank in your own eye.
[time=1745] You hypocrite. First take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
[time=1752] So how do we do this? How do we not go with the condemning heart? Write it down.
[time=1758] Take the plank out of your own eye. Write it down. Take the plank out of your own eye. Well what's that?
[time=1765] The plank is this sin of personal pride. It's a sin of personal pride.
[time=1770] It's kind of like saying my sin isn't as bad as yours in fact I might not even have it.
[time=1777] Ephesians 4 18 kind of says it this way. Do we have it or do you want me to?
[time=1782] We got it right here.
[time=1785] They are darkened in their understanding and separated. Separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
[time=1796] See the heart Jesus talked about this a lot. The heart and the eyes are inextricably linked.
[time=1802] My passion and my perspective. My perspective flows from my heart. So if I'm condemning others it's flowing from a hard heart of stone, a condemning heart of stone.
[time=1810] And I walk around with this plank in my own eye. It's kind of like this. You'd appreciate this customer of mine I traveled a lot with.
[time=1822] He had a lot of cars. He owned a landfill outside of a major city. And he was telling me about how challenging it was to get zoning for that.
[time=1832] And if I told you where it was you'd say oh my, how in the world. But every community needs these landfills.
[time=1838] And I'll never forget how he said it. He says Mitchell's like this.
[time=1842] Everybody thinks everybody else's garbage stinks but their own.
[time=1849] And you know it's the same way with this plank in our own eye. We think the garbage of everyone else's sin stinks but ours doesn't.
[time=1856] It's amazing how we do that. It is amazing how we do that. He says you've got to take that plank out of your own eye.
[time=1863] Personal pride has to be removed and then you will see clearly enough to remove the speck from your brother's eyes.
[time=1868] Now you say wait a minute Mitch brother. This is just about believers and that's why it's a speck and I'm open to that.
[time=1876] But here's just a little nuance I want to share with you. Brother has about ten different definitions.
[time=1881] Brother can mean biological. I have a brother. We have the same mom and dad.
[time=1885] Brother can be national. We're both from the same country. Brother can be neighbor. We know what Jesus did with the definition and neighbor.
[time=1891] Brother can mean common interest. Kind of like we are both like NASCAR or NFL football as God intended.
[time=1898] Or it could be mankind or it could be believer. So we got to be really careful.
[time=1902] And what really throws a monkey wrench if you just want to make it mean believer is this. He says you hypocrite.
[time=1909] A hypocrite is an actor, a pretender. Literally Jesus is now grabbing from the theater.
[time=1914] In Sephora probably one he worked on and construction with stone.
[time=1918] And in a theater they would wear a mask and behind the mask was somebody else. It's pretending. It's acting.
[time=1925] It's pretending to connect with God and not connecting with others.
[time=1928] It's a plank in your own eye. And commentators think that there are like two kinds of pretending in Scripture.
[time=1934] Two kinds of hypocrite. One is probably me. It's temporary.
[time=1938] I might be pretending on this one. But I sure don't want to be in this other camp and that's eternal.
[time=1944] There are hypocrites who remain hypocrites to the day they die.
[time=1949] So what Jesus is saying about take this plank out of our own eye. Get the plank out of my eye.
[time=1954] Is going to restore someone with total humility as if we could sin too.
[time=1962] As if we could sin too. Knowing that the garbage of our sin stinks too.
[time=1970] And that's heavy. It's really heavy. No plank. No mask. No acting. No pretending.
[time=1983] Then I can see clearly enough. Take this back out.
[time=1989] Grace can't judge. Grace can't judge. Galatians 6-1.
[time=1995] Galatians 6-1. Paul says, "Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently.
[time=2002] But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted, translate to get the plank out of your own eye.
[time=2007] No mask. No acting. No pretending."
[time=2013] Acts 2031.
[time=2016] So be on your guard. Remember that for three years I never stop warning each of you night and day with tears.
[time=2022] The plank was out. No mask. No acting. No pretending.
[time=2028] Proverbs 1911.
[time=2030] A man's wisdom gives impatience. It is to his glory to overlook and offense.
[time=2035] Get the plank out. No acting. No mask. No pretending.
[time=2040] Proverbs 17-9. He who covers over an offense. He who covers over an offense actually promotes love.
[time=2047] But whoever repeats the matter separates close friends. Get the plank out. No mask. No acting. No pretending.
[time=2055] Proverbs 12-16. A fool shows his annoyance at once.
[time=2060] But a prudent man overlooks and insults. Get the plank out. No mask. No acting. No pretending.
[time=2069] My sin garbage is just as bad.
[time=2073] In Jesus model what he taught, he didn't condemn the woman caught in adultery. Look what he said in John 8-10-11.
[time=2080] Jesus straightened up. He'd already taken all the attention from her and he had exposed the trap of how they'd entrapped her.
[time=2087] Because woman where Arlie has no one condemned you. No one, sir, she said.
[time=2094] Then neither do I condemn you. Jesus declared.
[time=2098] And he spoke truth. Go now and leave your life of sin.
[time=2103] But it came out of a heart that wasn't condemning.
[time=2107] You know, this is a risk, as I said, of anyone who takes his or her faith seriously.
[time=2113] I'll never forget about a year ago, I was asked a teacher from Lakewood called me and said, "Can you come do at least this first chapel, the person we had lined up for the first four weeks, he can't do it.
[time=2122] Something's happened and I need you right away." And I know it's late.
[time=2125] I'm really sorry. I said, "What do you want me to talk about?" She says, "It can be anything about Jesus." I said, "Well, praise the Lord." So it was really early in the morning I was working out and I was thinking,
[time=2135] "Well, what can I do? What can I do?" And I got a parallel thought going on inside me.
[time=2139] And that is I got to get this worksheet done for Wisdom Works.
[time=2144] I'm on WBCL every Thursday of the month with Lynn Ford from 9 to 10.
[time=2149] So my mom and you can listen if you want. I thought that was a lot funnier.
[time=2154] Actually, my mom doesn't listen. She's playing tennis at the time.
[time=2156] So maybe if you want to listen, call in or something. Eric, I don't know if I'm going to let you call in.
[time=2160] But anyway, so that's going on. I think I got to get this.
[time=2163] Well, I was working on this parable of the unforgiving debtor.
[time=2168] So I'm thinking about all that. I don't know why. I just men are slow sometimes, especially bald men. That was funnier. And it didn't hit me for like a few hours later.
[time=2181] Wait a minute. Why don't I do that chapel on withholding forgiveness?
[time=2185] That's what I'll do. I've already got it all worked out. I'll just go. This is great.
[time=2189] Well, let me put another parallel thought along that. And that's a background.
[time=2195] Susan, I just assumed it was a tone of voice. I'm sure it's my own internal insecurities and sensitivity.
[time=2200] But I don't know if you remember this, but I was probably holding it against you.
[time=2203] And I was probably being kind of quiet. You know how I get quiet? Oh, look at you smile.
[time=2207] Okay. So that's going on inside. So I go to the chapel and I teach.
[time=2214] I can't hear this is just going so well. We got this wonderful song at the end.
[time=2218] And I'm asking every kid to just think about, you know, are you withholding forgiveness?
[time=2221] I bowled it down. Made it really simple. And as I'm sitting there saying, hey, we're going to pray now.
[time=2225] The song is going to go. And we're going to just say, hey, God, is there anywhere where I'm withholding forgiveness from someone?
[time=2232] And I almost start shaking. I'm thinking, I cannot believe this. I'm teaching this stuff.
[time=2237] And I'm withholding forgiveness from my wife. It's just ridiculous.
[time=2241] Thank you, Jesus. So I go home and she this is still early in the morning.
[time=2246] And she's working out on the electrical machine. And I said, I'm so sorry.
[time=2251] I met with only because I got to get the plank out of my own eye. I got to get rid of this legalistic heart of stone.
[time=2257] And you know what? That's just a husband and wife deal.
[time=2261] But we do that same thing with people who are outside the eternal abundant life of Christ.
[time=2268] We do the same thing. And Jesus is saying, get the plank out. Realize that the ground is level at the foot of the cross.
[time=2276] And then, only then, we see clearly enough to see that speck of sin in someone else's eye.
[time=2283] Number one, do not go condemningly with a hard heart of stone. Number two, if you write it down, do not go carelessly with a hard heart of sand.
[time=2291] Do not go carelessly with a hard heart of sand. Verse six, do not give dogs what is sacred. Do not throw your pearls to pigs.
[time=2298] If you do, they may trample them under their feet and then turn and tear you to pieces.
[time=2302] A little confusing, so we're going to unpack that. So do not scatter your pearls. That's a common word for wisdom.
[time=2308] Do not scatter your pearls of wisdom to fools. Write that down. Do not scatter your pearls of wisdom to fools.
[time=2314] See, where a stone is legalistic pride, sand is loose pride. It's often pretending to connect with others, but not with God, often pretending to connect with others, but not with God.
[time=2325] It's careless. It's loose. It's flippin' with the gospels, pearls of wisdom. It naively scatters it.
[time=2333] It's a sandheart, write this down. A stoneheart tells, condemningly, a sandheart tells carelessly.
[time=2340] A sandheart tells carelessly. The key thing here is they're both telling.
[time=2347] So why not do that? They may trample them and turn and tear you to pieces.
[time=2352] So Jesus painted a picture of ravenous dogs. They were wild pigs. They were wild who would not give any consideration to a pearl of wisdom.
[time=2359] Their hearts were already hard. So the audience is cynics who automatically reject what they hear, and this is why Jesus taught in parables.
[time=2367] In the parable of the sower, he makes us really clear. There's this kind of progressive level of hard-heartedness.
[time=2373] And so Jesus said, "I taught in parables." They do the same thing in Palestine today. "I taught in parables in stories so that they'd have to leave and wrestle with it because their hearts were already hard."
[time=2382] And what rabbis did 2,000 years ago, what they do today is you, as you would come closer with your questions and want to go deeper, then they would explain and tell you more.
[time=2391] You would make a disciple. So what do we do here? This is huge, and I want you to write it down. This is what Jesus did.
[time=2402] So how are we going to do this? How are we going to not go carelessly with the heart, heart of sin? He discerned the wisdom appropriate for the level of heart-heartedness.
[time=2411] Write this down. This is big. He discerned the wisdom appropriate for the level of heart-heartedness. This is huge.
[time=2422] See, Jesus warned the Pharisees of carelessly speaking against the Holy Spirit. It's Matthew 12 verses 34 through 37 if you want to turn their Matthew 12 verses 34 through 37.
[time=2435] "You brood of vipers," he said. "How can you who are evil," I'll say anything good, "for out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks."
[time=2442] Now, not only eyes are the perspective flow are connected with the heart, so is the mouth.
[time=2447] The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.
[time=2453] But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.
[time=2462] For by your words, you will be acquitted, and by your words, you will be condemned.
[time=2470] By your words, you will be acquitted. By your words, you will be condemned. Jesus was careful with his words with Nicodemus.
[time=2482] It's John 3, if you want to look at it later today. He was careful with his words. He chose them specifically. He discerned the level of heart-heartedness.
[time=2490] Jesus was careful with his words with the rich young ruler. He discerned the level of heart-heartedness.
[time=2498] In his book, we came out, I think, a year ago, Michael Simpson wrote a book called "Permission of Angelism," and he points this out how Jesus would discern the level of heart-heartedness.
[time=2507] And that's why sometimes in our western culture, 2000 years later, with those kind of eyes, we look at that and say, "Wait a minute, Jesus, why aren't you doing this?
[time=2516] "Why aren't you going to close the deal? Why aren't you getting it? Come on!" It's because he discerned the level of heart-heartedness.
[time=2525] Proverbs teaches the same dilemma that occurs when one attempts to argue with a fool. You know, a cynical fool. We need to be careful, not careless, like a heart of sin.
[time=2535] Proverbs 26, verses 4 and 5. Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you'll be like him yourself.
[time=2542] Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes. What's that saying? You can't win arguing with the fool. We won't win.
[time=2549] Anybody reading Proverbs every day of the chapter that corresponds with the date of the month? Raise your hand if you are.
[time=2555] Oh, great. Extra credit for you. That's awesome. Dave, I love you, Dave. Look what we read this morning. This is Proverbs 9, verses 7 through 9.
[time=2565] Whoever corrects a mocker invites insult, whoever rebukes a wicked man incurs abuse, do not rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you, rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
[time=2574] Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still. Teach a righteous man, and he will add to his learning. What's Solomon saying?
[time=2581] Discern the level of hard, hardness, and be wise with your words. Paul taught that we should be wise toward outsiders. Colossians 4, 5, and 6.
[time=2592] Colossians 4, 5, and 6. Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders. Be shrewd. Make the most of every opportunity. It's a three-way call.
[time=2601] Verse 6. Let your conversation be always full of grace. Always full of grace. Not condemning, not careless, but full of grace.
[time=2610] Season with salt, that means we make them thirsty, we're shrewd, so that you may know how to answer everyone.
[time=2618] The situation we saw a lot is an unbelieving here, an unbelieving anywhere, an unbelieving spouse, with a believing spouse.
[time=2626] And I think the mistakes that the risk that we make of making this mistake is that we don't discern the level of hard-heartedness of that spouse.
[time=2635] I mean, you know what I'm saying? I mean, we just, we get a little too careless, a little too flippant, and we just say, just go say these King James verses of the Bible and watch them fall down.
[time=2643] It just doesn't seem to work that way. It doesn't know. We need to discern. We need to know what's going on in that heart.
[time=2648] And we need to be shrewd about how we communicate with that person. This is what Jesus is saying.
[time=2654] So do not go, condemningly with a hard heart of stone, do not go condemningly with a hard heart, a careless heart of sand, but go connectedly, write it down.
[time=2664] Go connectedly with a soft heart of clay. Go connectedly with a soft heart of clay.
[time=2669] This is humility, bending the knees of our hearts, connecting both with God and with others.
[time=2675] Humility in both directions, both the vertical and the horizontal, so that others will connect with God.
[time=2681] Whereas a stone heart tells condemningly, a sand heart tells carelessly, a connected heart, a clay heart, asks, connectedly or humbly, asks, connectedly or humbly.
[time=2697] So we're going to look at the three connections quickly. Connection number one is ask God.
[time=2703] Verse 7 through 11. Connection number one, ask God. Ask Him who will be given to you. Seek and you will find.
[time=2709] Knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks to receive, he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks the door will be opened.
[time=2715] Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone, or if he asks for fish, will give him a snake.
[time=2721] If you then, though you're evil, know how to give good gifts to your children.
[time=2725] How much more you'll father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him?
[time=2731] Huh? Ask. See, this is possibly describing a progressive increase of intensity in prayer, a progressive increase in intensity of prayer.
[time=2743] Ask and receive, that's a humble heart. Seek and find, that's making my muscles move with my prayers.
[time=2749] Seek and find, make my muscles move with my prayers. Knock and the door will be opened. That's to never give up.
[time=2755] That's to be persistent. But you might want to ask yourself, what? This is what I did. Receive what? Find what? Open what?
[time=2765] I looked in Luke at the parallel passage. I think the answer is not what, but who? Look at this.
[time=2772] This is Luke verse 11. I mean chapter 11 verses 9 through 13.
[time=2778] So I say to you, asking it will be given to you. Seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened to you.
[time=2784] For everyone who asks receives, who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened.
[time=2788] Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead.
[time=2792] Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion.
[time=2795] If you then, though you're evil, know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?
[time=2807] The Holy Spirit to those who ask him. The very first connection is to ask God for his Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ.
[time=2817] He number one, removes the planks from our own eyes and gives us wisdom to discern but not condemn with a hard heart of stone.
[time=2824] Number two, he keeps us from being careless with the gospel pearls giving us wisdom to answer outsiders at the appropriate level for going a hard heart of sand.
[time=2834] Number three, he gives us a humble clay heart that connects.
[time=2838] It's made the bull in the hands of the potter, the humble heart of Christ.
[time=2842] Jesus said, I am humble in heart. So here's what we need to do.
[time=2846] We need to first ask the Holy Spirit into our lives. We need to buy grace through faith, receive His forgiveness as Savior and Lord of our lives.
[time=2853] And His Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, pitches His tent in us. He dwells in us.
[time=2857] And there's this unique expression of Christ in each one of us. It's different in me that it's in Steve.
[time=2862] It's the same Christ, but there's a unique expression.
[time=2867] And then second, we need to ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom for each encounter.
[time=2872] On the fly as we go.
[time=2876] Bill Heibel said, the difference between spirit letter not is about five seconds. Just say, God, what do you want me to do?
[time=2882] God, what do you want me to do?
[time=2884] Connection number two. Connection number one is to ask God. Connection number two is to obviously ask others.
[time=2890] Jesus said so in everything, due to others, what you would have them do to you.
[time=2895] This is called the golden rule because Emperor Alexander Severus had it written on his wall in gold.
[time=2901] See, this allows us to connect with others. They don't want to be told.
[time=2907] We don't want to be told. We want to be asked.
[time=2911] If we ask others about their needs, if we'd listen, then we're equipped to serve them in order to meet those needs.
[time=2916] And we connect with them. We connect with them.
[time=2920] And we won't know how to serve them in the way that they want or need to be served unless we humbly ask and listen.
[time=2926] Solomon said that no one should answer before listening. Do we have Proverbs 18, 13?
[time=2930] That no one should answer before listening. Who who he who answers before listening.
[time=2934] That's his folly and his shame. I just want to ask you, how often do we do that in an evangelistic relationship?
[time=2941] How often do we do that as a corporate relationship?
[time=2945] We need to ask.
[time=2949] So, we're talking about this one time. And these are like Steve Long great questions.
[time=2954] You know, you connect with another person. Hi, how are you? Tell me about your life.
[time=2958] Where are you from? And all of a sudden you're there just starting to speak.
[time=2962] But I'm going to share with you a few questions, none of which have ever received pushback.
[time=2967] Okay? So I'm going to share with you in case they could help you.
[time=2971] All right? One is I ask people, what is your church or spiritual background?
[time=2976] I'm going to ask someone who's outside Christ. I'm not sure.
[time=2981] But I might say, hey, what is your church or spiritual background? Nobody's ever balked at that question to me.
[time=2988] Second one is I just ask them a little bit about their life. I have a little bit about their story and they start communicating to me.
[time=2993] And I follow up with this question.
[time=2995] And they might tell me it's something a struggle in their lives. And I'll just say, where is God and all that for you?
[time=3000] No one has ever taken offense to that question in my personal experience.
[time=3005] Third, I'll say, well, in terms of that God thing, would you call yourself skeptic, seeker, or surrendered?
[time=3017] Skeptic, seeker, or surrendered? And if they're not in a relationship with Christ, they'll usually waffle somewhere between skeptic,
[time=3028] and seeker. But you see what's going on there? There's this second connection that's starting to happen.
[time=3036] And don't forget that we're connected with God first.
[time=3039] So we ask God, ask, seek, knock for the Holy Spirit. We ask the Holy Spirit to discern in these connections.
[time=3045] Second connection is to ask others some questions like that, like I shared.
[time=3049] Third connection, three, is that others ask God into their lives.
[time=3053] You might say, how did you do that? Look at this. For this sums up the law and the prophets.
[time=3058] Do you know what the law and the prophets were designed to do? We did a sermon on it once.
[time=3063] The law and the prophets were designed to connect people to God.
[time=3068] And in fact, there's this Hebrew literary device called an inclusio. An inclusio means, and Jesus used it in the Beatitudes.
[time=3074] It means that if you look at the bookends, if you look at what he said at the beginning and what at the end, that's the main point all the way through.
[time=3080] This is just me now. Now, I'm wondering if this is an inclusio because Jesus closes this up with this sums up the law and the prophets.
[time=3087] And if you go back to right after his previous inclusio, the beginning bookend in Matthew 5 17, he says,
[time=3094] "Do not think that I've come to abolish the law of the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fill them full.
[time=3100] To declare their clarity and purpose."
[time=3107] First Peter 3.15 says it this way.
[time=3110] When you ask God and you ask God, look what happens.
[time=3112] But in your heart, set apart Christ's Lord, ask Him.
[time=3115] Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have, but do it with the gentleness and respect that comes from the Holy Spirit.
[time=3123] See, this connection, number three, is others will start asking us questions back, and then others will eventually ask God into their lives.
[time=3130] Jesus connected with the heart of the woman at the well.
[time=3133] Jesus was connected with the heart of the Father. Jesus connected with the heart of people, and He discerned their level of heart-heartedness, and people were connected with God.
[time=3142] Every encounter was a three-way call. He wasn't condemning. He wasn't careless. He asked connectedly.
[time=3150] It's going to come up on the screen.
[time=3154] I want you to write this down. When we ask God and ask others, the Holy Spirit connects others with God.
[time=3162] I have asked Jill to come back up and sing that song one more time,
[time=3169] and in a way, today we have our own inclusio.
[time=3173] Because the bottom line comes down to, in these encounters, would we rather have Jesus, or would we rather have our own kingdom?
[time=3182] You know, I've had the opportunities you're teaching pastor to pray with scores of people who surrendered their hearts to Christ,
[time=3188] by the greatest single privilege of my life, and sometimes when I can't go to sleep.
[time=3193] All those faces start to come to me, but you know what? It just doesn't happen all the time, but I tell you what, I can tell you this about every one of those encounters.
[time=3202] They were asked.
[time=3204] Each person was asked, would you like to make November 9, 2008, the day that you drew the line in the sand,
[time=3211] you put a stake in the ground, and you fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ as Savior and Lord?
[time=3215] Would you like to do that?
[time=3217] And somewhere along the line, we got to ask.
[time=3222] And then they will ask God into their lives.
[time=3226] And so, as Jill sings, I just invite you to ask the Holy Spirit, maybe bow your heads, close your eyes,
[time=3232] and palms up and say, God, take my condemning heart of stone.
[time=3236] Take my careless heart of sand and give me a soft heart of clay that is connected with you.
[time=3241] I want to be a person who asks, I want those three connections to be true in my life.
[time=3245] God, give me a humble heart, help me to see that every encounter is a three-way call.
[time=3251] Pride causes static in the connection.
[time=3255] Humility offers a clear connection.
[time=3265] I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold.
[time=3274] I'd rather be his than have riches untold.
[time=3283] I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
[time=3291] I'd rather be led by his nail pierced hands than to be the king of a vast domain
[time=3308] or be held in sin's red sway.
[time=3315] I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.
[time=3331] I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause.
[time=3340] I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause.
[time=3348] I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
[time=3356] I'd rather be true to his holy name than to be the king of a vast domain
[time=3373] or be held in sin's red sway.
[time=3382] I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.
[time=3407] Let's pray.
[time=3413] God, thank you for Uncle Darryl.
[time=3417] Who didn't tell me condemning me?
[time=3420] Who didn't tell me carelessly?
[time=3423] But ask connectedly.
[time=3428] God, thanks for Susan.
[time=3431] It does the same thing.
[time=3436] God, I pray as Mr. someone here who needs to ask the Holy Spirit in his or her life
[time=3443] that that would happen today.
[time=3445] Either with the people they came with or the elders will be here.
[time=3449] I'll be here.
[time=3451] But God, I just pray that today we just left that stone heart right in here.
[time=3458] We're not going to tell condemning me.
[time=3460] We check that sand heart at the door now as we leave and we're not going to go tell carelessly.
[time=3464] But God, we're going to go ask connectedly in total humility to you and humility as we connect with others.
[time=3472] And God, we pray and we would give you all the praise and the glory and the credit for others who will connect with your Holy Spirit and ask you into their lives.
[time=3479] We pray these things in Jesus name.
[time=3494] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
