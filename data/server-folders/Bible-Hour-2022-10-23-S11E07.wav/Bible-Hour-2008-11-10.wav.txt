[time=830] "You are worthy, you are worthy, you are worthy, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy, you are worthy to be praised forever."
[time=860] "You are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day.
[time=890] Now my eyes have ceased.
[time=920] Forever and a day, you are worthy, you are worthy, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day.
[time=950] Sing it in.
[time=955] We'll sing it and follow the highest praise.
[time=992] Sing it with your worthy, you are worthy, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day.
[time=1018] We're worthy, you are worthy, you are worthy, you are worthy to be praised forever and a day.
[time=1035] We'll sing it and follow the highest praise.
[time=1064] Whatever my God, the best of me to say, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=1091] It is well with my soul with my soul, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=1121] We'll sing it and follow the highest praise.
[time=1171] It is well with my soul with my soul, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=1197] It is well with my soul, it is well with my soul.
[time=1216] It is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul.
[time=1239] It is well with my soul, it is well with my soul.
[time=1289] It is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul.
[time=1385] It is well with my soul, it is well with my soul.
[time=1405] It is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul.
[time=1493] It is well with my soul.
[time=1515] It is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul.
[time=1846] Most of you don't, but I will try to help you with it in the days to come, do you have any idea of the division that existed between Jews and Gentiles?
[time=1856] Do you understand what a jump this was, do you understand what a chasm existed in between Jews and Gentiles?
[time=1869] God says, and God allows providentially for the gospel now to go to the Gentiles, and He says to those leading on the Jewish front, brothers, they're your brothers now, they're your sisters, we're one family.
[time=1885] I would say to you, I would submit to you this morning, and we'll talk more about this, that the chasm that existed between the Jews and the Gentiles, very similar to what you and I, many of us in the room have seen in this country,
[time=1898] in the 60s and 70s between whites and blacks, and so many of the issues that exist there, so many of the tensions that reside there.
[time=1911] I'm so grateful for the progress that we've made, but I can't wait for you and I in the days to come to think about the opportunities that God's giving us to in this neighborhood.
[time=1922] Are you looking around this neighborhood? Are your eyes open to the reality of this community?
[time=1931] Are you seeing with me the opportunity God's giving us here?
[time=1937] We're used to seeing it as kids, red and yellow, black and white.
[time=1943] They are what? Precious. Precious in His sight. And more and more so, my friends, in the days to come, more and more so, you and I will right here at State and Lamy are have the opportunity to treat them as precious, to extend hands toward them,
[time=1960] to be a family willing to embrace and walk alongside them.
[time=1965] And there will be some challenges, but I can't wait to face them, because the Gospel and the Kingdom of God is so much bigger than those challenges, and all of our differences go away at the foot of the what?
[time=1977] Cross. I got ahead. Sorry. So I was thankful for my opportunity.
[time=1983] Next time I'm going to take about 50 to 100 of you with me. That was my mistake.
[time=1987] My mistake was not taking you with me. You would have an absolute blast.
[time=1991] But hey, let's jump back in here for a bit this morning.
[time=1995] I want to just talk to you a little bit about another. I want to begin this morning to talk with you about another implication.
[time=2003] And when I say implication, I hope, again, I hope you understand what I mean.
[time=2007] There are, as we've gone through this series, it was an amazing time as we made our way through those five elements.
[time=2012] But all the while we were making our way through those five elements, I kept making in our leadership team, we kind of kept making little notes.
[time=2020] We would kind of get through one element, but we'd realize that as we made our way through that element, there were some things there that we needed to come back to.
[time=2028] There were some things we needed as a family to talk more about.
[time=2032] There was some teaching, further teaching that needed to be done on that subject matter.
[time=2038] And so we've just kind of compiled a list. I want to share that with you and teach through that and talk with you about these things in the days to come.
[time=2046] We began several weeks ago with the first implication.
[time=2051] We just kind of, you know, we just kind of did this. They're not in any order, really.
[time=2055] But we just kind of talked about one of the huge implications of our time in that series having to do with transformational community.
[time=2063] There on the screen you see the five elements.
[time=2066] This series has led us to a place where we as a family, you all have with me, you've knotted your head.
[time=2072] Most all of you we have said this is really who we want to be.
[time=2076] We really don't want to be just attenders.
[time=2081] We really want to be a people thoroughly and actually engaged in this great calling that God has placed on us to imitate his son, to follow after the pattern that he left.
[time=2092] And this is the pattern he left.
[time=2094] And unless I miss something we're all kind of together in this thing saying this is who we desire to be.
[time=2101] Those who are committed to prayerfully abiding.
[time=2103] Those who are devoted to the scriptures.
[time=2105] Those who are absolutely committed to living and sharing and experiencing life together in a smaller setting than this.
[time=2113] We want to be people who are devoted.
[time=2116] Obstinate that word devoted to missional serving, serving that goes beyond you and me, serving that goes and stretches into God's kingdom work, serving that's about meeting needs.
[time=2129] Serving that moves us inside these four walls to four year olds down the hall and serving that leads us to the inner city and to the soup kitchens and to those who need jackets for a cold winter that's about to hit.
[time=2142] We want to be a place that's completely engaged in missional serving opportunities and we want to be committed to making disciples, the five elements.
[time=2151] As we taught through that we wanted to come back and hit some things, the first of which was transformational community is a must.
[time=2159] I had them put this in the bulletin again.
[time=2161] Pull this out, would you?
[time=2162] I wanted to show this to you one more time and I'm going to show this to you again this morning because it means that much to me.
[time=2168] My friends, we are asking every one of you to be willing and ready to move beyond the great benefit of this setting.
[time=2176] We believe there is great benefit in this setting.
[time=2179] In these 70 minutes, oftentimes God begins to further you and I down this road of discipleship.
[time=2186] We begin to, as we study and learn from the Scripture, see things in our lives that need to and must change.
[time=2193] But the fruition of that, the completion of that, the furthering of that happens in settings that promote intimacy and honesty and accountability.
[time=2203] And that's this.
[time=2204] There are more than these.
[time=2206] This list doesn't include the home group and small group opportunities that are available to you.
[time=2212] But this, my friends, is a chance for anybody in this room who's not connected in one of those all important smaller settings to be connected.
[time=2222] You can call these people. You can email them. You can talk to us about them.
[time=2227] But we'll do whatever we have to do because we are convinced that in those settings, in that place of relationships, smaller than this place, is where you get to grow.
[time=2239] I mentioned this in an email recently.
[time=2241] Let me just say it again to you.
[time=2242] Do you understand, too, that we've taken this to a point now where we're so serious about this?
[time=2247] We've now connected elders, all elders, and those who have served as elders in the past are helping us with this.
[time=2255] All those on our leadership team are now connected individually and personally.
[time=2261] We have elders who are now connected to everybody who leads a smaller setting, whether it's a home group, whether it's an ABF, whether it's an accountability group, or even those who lead ministries.
[time=2274] Every one of them now is connected personally with an elder from our team so that that elder can encourage that smaller setting leader.
[time=2285] And here's the kicker. Here's the punch.
[time=2288] Hold that smaller setting leader accountable to the implementation and pursuit of those five things.
[time=2297] Because we believe when this place is radically devoted across the board to embracing and pursuing those five things, God's going to change us and He's going to change this place.
[time=2307] And we're going to do everything we can to lovingly hold you accountable, encourage you, equip you, set you up to succeed in your pursuit of those five things.
[time=2318] But to do that, we've got to have you in a setting where we can get to you in a good way.
[time=2324] And so please, would you consider any one of these?
[time=2327] You are welcome to any one of these and we'd love to help you get connected.
[time=2332] One huge implication of elemental.
[time=2335] Secondly was what Mitchell talked to you about last week.
[time=2338] Mitchell talked with you about making disciples and yet the thrust of what he taught you and the thrust of what Mitchell and I have been discussing on that very front is that oftentimes we think about making disciples and we think about further training
[time=2353] and further investment in the already convinced, discipling them.
[time=2358] It's a good thing.
[time=2359] What we sometimes miss out on or miss is the fact that really the discipling process begins.
[time=2366] Well, Jesus did this really well.
[time=2369] The discipling process began with Zacchaeus when Jesus called him out of the sycamore.
[time=2378] You with me?
[time=2379] That's where you say yes, preacher.
[time=2382] God, never mind.
[time=2383] Forget it.
[time=2384] You're so.
[time=2389] The discipling process begins when you and I are faithful to engage in those redemptive relationships and those redemptive opportunities.
[time=2398] Evangelism, redemptive living is the beginning of the making disciple process.
[time=2406] Jesus didn't have to go through Samaria on that trip that day.
[time=2410] It was actually quicker if he would have gone around it, but he knew he wanted to go through Samaria and stop at the well because he knew at the well he'd meet the woman.
[time=2421] And with that woman, he engages the making disciples process.
[time=2425] See, you and I have to have redemptive evangelism radar up if you want to call it that.
[time=2431] However you want to say it, we have to live daily with this willingness and readiness to connect with those far from God in an effort to with God's help move them toward faith in Christ.
[time=2442] What a great reminder that was.
[time=2444] Here's a third one.
[time=2446] We'll jump into this this morning and we'll spend a little bit of time on this.
[time=2453] And I think the way I've said it is we must regain one implication from my own study of the book of Acts in this first church that followed after the example of our Lord.
[time=2463] We must regain the awe.
[time=2466] Would you write that down?
[time=2468] We must regain the awe.
[time=2473] Let me get you thinking about this.
[time=2476] This way.
[time=2478] Think of all the things.
[time=2480] All right, everybody, listen.
[time=2481] I want you to do this.
[time=2482] Think of all the things.
[time=2483] All the settings are people that you describe as awesome.
[time=2486] It's a word we use a lot.
[time=2488] Come on.
[time=2489] It is a word and it's not just the kids.
[time=2491] It's not just the students.
[time=2493] I mean everybody.
[time=2494] I mean, for the most part, this is a word that is very familiar to you and I.
[time=2498] I want you to think right now about all that there is in your life in mind that we would on any given day describe as awesome.
[time=2511] Go ahead.
[time=2512] Think about it.
[time=2513] I mean, we call a steak awesome.
[time=2517] We call restaurants awesome.
[time=2520] We call the Colts.
[time=2525] You can.
[time=2526] Go ahead.
[time=2527] I'm not going to.
[time=2528] Awesome.
[time=2529] All right.
[time=2530] We call IU, Purdue, North Carolina.
[time=2533] We call athletic teams awesome.
[time=2537] We call entertainers awesome.
[time=2539] Come on.
[time=2540] That's something out.
[time=2541] What do we call awesome?
[time=2544] Cash.
[time=2545] We call money awesome.
[time=2546] What else?
[time=2547] Church.
[time=2548] Say it again.
[time=2550] Grandkids.
[time=2551] Which is a good thing.
[time=2552] We call grandkids awesome.
[time=2554] What was that?
[time=2555] What?
[time=2556] Mountains?
[time=2557] Scenery.
[time=2558] Beauty.
[time=2559] We call mountains and rivers and lakes.
[time=2560] We call them all.
[time=2561] What?
[time=2562] Say it.
[time=2563] Awesome.
[time=2564] We are loving that word.
[time=2565] We use that word frequently and we connect it to all kinds of things.
[time=2570] We talk to my eight year old son, Jake.
[time=2573] Most every eight year old I know everything to an eight year old is what?
[time=2579] Awesome.
[time=2580] I mean, Jake will just go on and on about Peyton Manning and the Colts, his big brother.
[time=2584] I mean, you name it.
[time=2585] He has just got that word ready on the tip of his tongue.
[time=2589] Awesome.
[time=2590] Everybody say it one more time.
[time=2592] Okay.
[time=2593] So I'm thinking about that a lot lately.
[time=2596] And I come to, I come to Acts and you want you to go there too, Acts chapter two.
[time=2601] And we've read this passage so many times, but right there at the beginning of that passage that we've read so many times, Acts two, 42 to 47, in 42 and 43, all of a sudden in the
[time=2613] last few weeks, I noticed this.
[time=2616] They were, look with me at 42, they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching
[time=2623] and to fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[time=2629] Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe, which is short for everyone real quick, who, who?
[time=2644] Every one, this is describing the church here in Jerusalem and Acts.
[time=2649] How many people in that church kept feeling a sense of awe, answer?
[time=2654] Everyone kept, everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonders and signs were taking
[time=2661] place.
[time=2662] So I just start thinking about this.
[time=2666] And I just, for myself, I won't speak for you.
[time=2668] I came to the conclusion that I've lost that sense of awe.
[time=2678] I don't live with that constantly.
[time=2683] And what further solidified my conclusion that I'd lost it, what further solidified my
[time=2689] hunch, really, that we've lost it, is I just looked up the definition of the word.
[time=2694] I went to the original language, you know, I looked up the word, I looked up some other places that talked about that word, and then I also looked at the grammar of the sentence.
[time=2704] And so the definition of the word and the grammar of the sentence, both of which I'm about to tell you, completely and absolutely and utterly convinced me that we've lost it.
[time=2715] Here's your definition, awe, awe, a deeply rooted and active response, trying to help
[time=2723] you all with your active responses this morning.
[time=2726] We're getting there.
[time=2727] awe means a deeply rooted, it emanates from deep within you, it is this deeply rooted
[time=2733] and active response that is both personal and corporate.
[time=2737] The word captures both the sense of here in Acts 2.43, that they were as individuals
[time=2744] and they were as a family, individually and together, corporately and personally, mentally
[time=2750] and emotionally, the word captures both.
[time=2753] It's not just a cognitive, that's awesome.
[time=2756] But it's a visceral, it's this emotionally deep rooted response as well and it all gets
[time=2762] brought together.
[time=2764] Next slide, it all gets brought together.
[time=2766] The word signifies being captivated, I love this.
[time=2769] The word means to be captivated and enamored.
[time=2776] This is where it gets a little dicey, this is where it starts to get a little convicting.
[time=2782] This is where many of you in the room, including me again, as I read those words, we begin
[time=2788] to think about those things that were captivated and enamored with, awe, being in awe.
[time=2798] The word signifies being captivated and enamored with God at work, blown away, absolutely blown
[time=2806] away by God's miraculous work, God's miraculous movement in the hearts and lives of the people.
[time=2816] I read that definition.
[time=2820] My sense is that we've lost it, that we don't live with that.
[time=2826] That's not normative for most of us.
[time=2829] And then I look at the grammar of the sentence and you know I don't usually like bore you with Greek grammar, but I always tell you about Greek grammar when the Greek grammar means something.
[time=2838] And here it means something, my friends, because here when you look at that phrase, go ahead, go back to 43, every one kept feeling.
[time=2846] You see that?
[time=2847] Every one kept feeling, a sense of awe.
[time=2852] That phrase there in the Greek comes in the present active.
[time=2855] And the present active, I've told you this before, the present active signifies something that has started and then continues in an ongoing and continuous fashion.
[time=2865] It doesn't stop, it is consistent, it is constant, it is perpetual.
[time=2870] They were consistently and constantly and perpetually in awe of God.
[time=2875] And having been in awe of God, they never ceased to be in awe of God.
[time=2879] They were captivated and enamored with God always.
[time=2890] I read the definition, I look at the grammar, I become more and more convinced that this is not the case for so many of us, individually and corporately as a body.
[time=2904] So I began to read and I began to think through where we've been.
[time=2907] I began to study this and ask God for some guidance on this and came up with three things.
[time=2915] Three reasons, three explanations, I believe that speak to how we've lost it.
[time=2922] And then three, I think, responses that would be somewhere along the lines of how you and I could with God's help get it back.
[time=2931] Three reasons how we've lost this sense of awe.
[time=2934] Let me just jump in here too, maybe one or two and then we'll finish up next week.
[time=2938] Here's the first one, how do we lose this?
[time=2941] How have we found ourselves at this place where we're really as a body and as individuals
[time=2948] not living in this constant and perpetual state of being captivated and enamored by God, blown away by key word here, blown away by the miraculous.
[time=2959] One reason we've lost it, I think, is an unhealthy – write this down – an unhealthy fear
[time=2965] of the miraculous.
[time=2966] I believe many of us exist with an unhealthy fear of the miraculous.
[time=2972] And what I mean by that is this, me for one, I'll speak for me here.
[time=2977] I grew up spiritually, theologically and doctrinally.
[time=2983] I grew up in this world that most would call conservative theology.
[time=2988] And I'm okay with that.
[time=2989] I'm okay with the fact that I grew up kind of pre-trib, pre-mill, authoritative – you
[time=2995] know, the authority of the Word of God, the deity of Christ, the importance of the body of Christ, the power and the redemptive value of the church.
[time=3003] I mean, I kind of grew up with that as a theology, a framework for my spiritual life.
[time=3010] And what happened was that in that theology – and I'm 12, I'm 14, I'm 17, I'm a
[time=3016] young adult.
[time=3018] And as I lived in that theology, you know, we kind of – and I think many of you experienced this to some degree or another – as we were living in our conservative theology, we kind of hear rumblings over there in this world of the Pentecostal, over in the world of
[time=3035] the Assemblies of God, over there with the Charismatics.
[time=3040] We're like, "Whoa, what's going on over there?" And see, over here, we kept hearing about the miraculous.
[time=3048] And over here, the miraculous got defined for us, and it's kind of always been defined for the most part.
[time=3054] The miraculous over here got defined as tongues healing and prophecy, tongues healing and
[time=3060] prophecy, or a word from the Lord.
[time=3063] There were all these things going on over here, and we didn't quite know what to do with it.
[time=3068] We didn't quite know what to make of it.
[time=3070] We kind of stood here with our theology, which I, today, happened to still believe was accurate,
[time=3077] but we looked over there and we got scared, we got freaked out, and we got critical, and
[time=3083] we got judgmental, and it created this kind of an unhealthy deal between us and them.
[time=3090] And on top of the unhealthy fear, I will say this, there were some, not all, in that
[time=3096] world over there who really abused their leadership in that role, in that world.
[time=3101] There were those who started slapping people on their heads and blowing on people and
[time=3108] selling cloths and all kinds of stuff.
[time=3111] It's not at all consistent with this, and it confused a lot of people, and it manipulated a lot of people.
[time=3118] So for the most part, over here, we just kind of wrote them off.
[time=3123] And the miraculous, well, we just kind of started saying, if that's miraculous, I don't believe
[time=3130] in it.
[time=3132] And I think that was, to some degree, a mistake, because I think there is some miraculous stuff
[time=3138] that we could be really, really inspired by, encouraged by, and we'll get to that in just a moment.
[time=3144] But the unhealthy fear of the miraculous has led to an existence where we've taken the
[time=3150] Holy Spirit, and all that comes with the Holy Spirit, all the manifestations of God in His
[time=3156] Spirit.
[time=3158] We've just kind of, I think, sometimes out of fear and discomfort, put all that in a box and said it's just going to look like this, because at least this we can manage.
[time=3171] And I'm not so sure that's good.
[time=3173] Secondly, there was an unhealthy fear of the miraculous with some confusion, you know,
[time=3180] and cold in.
[time=3181] Secondly, there's been an unhealthy substitution, write that down, an unhealthy substitution.
[time=3188] And by unhealthy substitution, now I'm back to the cults, and the stake, and the mountains,
[time=3194] and the athletes, and the record labels, and the homes, and the vacations, and the cars.
[time=3201] You with me?
[time=3203] We have become so enamored with people and their stuff.
[time=3208] You and I buy magazines, and we watch TV shows, and we try so hard to keep up with all the
[time=3215] amazing, awesome stuff that's going on, and what they own, and what they drive, and where
[time=3221] they live, and how many square feet.
[time=3225] And we've just completely swapped out.
[time=3229] Little A awesome stuff that in the bigger scheme of things doesn't make a hill of beans
[time=3235] difference.
[time=3238] And we've taken big A awesome God and His miraculous work among us, and it's just become one of many things that we kind of get excited about.
[time=3250] So there's been this unhealthy substitution, there's this unhealthy fear of the miraculous,
[time=3257] and then thirdly I just wrote this down, an unhealthy presence of too many unhealthy
[time=3266] spiritual hearts.
[time=3270] Because listen, whenever you have an unhealthy spiritual heart, when you've got a heart that's
[time=3276] shrinking and not growing, when you've got a heart that's distant and detached from the Lord.
[time=3282] You have spiritually a heart that's cold, a heart that's hardened.
[time=3287] Please hear me friends, spiritually cold, hard hearts aren't awed by anything.
[time=3295] They're just not, they're just dead, selfish, closed, cynical, untrusting.
[time=3306] And spiritually unhealthy heart isn't in awe of much at all.
[time=3312] Now we probably could go four, five, six, seven, eight deep, you know, on reasons why we've lost it.
[time=3319] But those are three for you to consider.
[time=3322] And next week we're going to come back and we're going to talk about how we can get it back.
[time=3326] Some steps that you and I can take.
[time=3328] Some things that we see right here in God's Word that can really, I think, help us as a people be appropriately and powerfully in awe of God.
[time=3340] If you read the passage again, these people who lived in awe of God, read it and be reminded
[time=3347] of what He did with them.
[time=3349] Be reminded of the impact and the effect they had on a culture, a culture that's looking for, a culture that's drawn to, a culture that's intrigued by those who live in awe
[time=3360] of the right thing.
[time=3363] And very unique about it.
[time=3364] And when you and I live that way, just incredible, as the passage goes on, they had favor with
[time=3370] all the people and He was adding to their number day by day.
[time=3375] All right, come back next week and we'll finish that up.
[time=3378] And then we'll move on to some other implications of elemental, can't wait to be together.
[time=3383] Let's stand and pray.
[time=3386] Father in heaven, we're grateful for the morning and we thank you, God, as a family.
[time=3392] For what you're teaching us, God, for what you're showing us in your word, God, for what it means in the everyday of our life, individually in God, the everyday of our life as a family.
[time=3403] Oh, Father, God, I pray that we would continue to sit close down here to the front.
[time=3410] I pray we would continue to sit next to people.
[time=3413] I pray we would continue to talk to people and introduce ourselves to each other.
[time=3418] God, I pray that we would go and engage in smaller settings.
[time=3422] God, I pray that those who are leading and participating in smaller settings would be so ready to welcome people, even this week, into their small community of believers.
[time=3433] And God, give us strength and grace as leaders, as we in this gathering, and in those smaller
[time=3440] settings, do our very best with your help to hold these people accountable and to invite
[time=3447] them, God, to a life of living out these elemental disciplines, God, so that we can
[time=3453] be the people that you've called us to be, a people who will gather, a people who will connect, and ultimately, God, a people who will go.
[time=3464] Go as we partner with you in the expansion of your kingdom inside and outside these
[time=3470] four walls.
[time=3471] God, we're grateful for such a calling as this.
[time=3475] We love you, and we look forward to being together again soon, if that be your will.
[time=3479] And all the people in the room agreed and said, "Amen."
