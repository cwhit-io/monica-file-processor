[time=65] - Hey everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour again.
[time=72] My name's Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=75] And as always, I'm so grateful for these few moments that we get to spend together.
[time=81] I wanna ask you a question this morning.
[time=82] What are you doing December 19th, 20th and 21st?
[time=86] I know it's just saying those dates immediately brings to your mind and to mine.
[time=92] What a busy time that is, as all of us prepare for this great holiday that we get to celebrate, this great event of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=102] I hope somewhere in those dates that Friday, Saturday or Sunday, I really hope you'll make some time and come and be with us for what we call Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=113] You know, Blackhawks had the privilege of celebrating Christmas with this community for over 35 years.
[time=119] What a privilege it's been for us to year after year.
[time=123] Take the great truth of Christmas and combine that with the arts, with music and drama.
[time=129] And to proclaim to those that God brings our way, the great miracle of the birth of our Lord.
[time=137] We'll do it again this year and I can't wait for you to see what Corbin Miller and our team has put together.
[time=143] It is going to be a phenomenal celebration.
[time=146] It's majestic, it's beautiful, it's moving, it's stirring, it's funny, there are so many components to it that I think will really, really encourage you.
[time=156] But I wanna ask you this, will you come and be with us and will you bring someone with you?
[time=161] That's right, will you think now about a coworker or someone in your neighborhood?
[time=166] Maybe a family relative, maybe somebody in your life who you know is open to the great life-changing truth of the gospel, the great life-changing truth of Christmas.
[time=178] We will do our very best to communicate that to you and to them and together we'll celebrate what God did as he gave us the great gift of his son.
[time=187] It means a lot to us.
[time=188] We don't get to see many of you very often.
[time=191] Many of you are a part of your own local church and many of you kind of stay home maybe on Sundays and take in the Bible hour.
[time=198] This is a chance, CWB for you to come.
[time=201] Be on our campus, be in the room with us and come down front afterwards and say hello to me.
[time=206] I'd love to meet you and I'd love to meet those that maybe you bring along with you.
[time=210] So give it some thought.
[time=211] Go to the website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=214] There's a CWB logo there on the right, click on that and you can follow directions and secure as many free tickets as you would need for whatever performance you and your friends would like to come to.
[time=227] We're thankful for you and looking forward to this great celebration.
[time=231] We hope you'll come and be with us.
[time=233] It'll be good to see you.
[time=234] God bless you.
[time=235] Thanks for being a part of our Bible Hour family and we hope to see you this year at CWB.
[time=241] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 228 seconds]
[time=480] (gentle music) - What a great truth and what a great privilege for us
[time=501] to hear that song this morning.
[time=504] No orphans, nobody on the outside looking in.
[time=507] And what a great opportunity for the last 30, 35 minutes or so for us as a family to lift our voices and our praise to him.
[time=517] And I hope you've been encouraged and I hope you've been reminded of great truth.
[time=523] And I hope it's encouraged your heart and soul.
[time=525] And my prayer is that as we jump into our continued study and look at his word that it would do the very same thing with you in the moments to come.
[time=534] That it would encourage you and stretch you and challenge you and remind you of what's true.
[time=540] And I'm looking forward to it.
[time=541] Hey everybody, if you would, take out the white insert in your bulletin, if you would please.
[time=547] It says, "Welcome Lord Jesus, we've been waiting for you "advent readings." Would you take that out?
[time=554] Wanna just make sure that you're aware of something that we're gonna be putting in your hands next week.
[time=560] Didn't want you to get it and not kinda know what it was.
[time=563] For some of you in the room, it kinda depends I think on how we grew up spiritually, if you will, what they did at your church may have been different than what they did at mine.
[time=575] But advent may be something that you're familiar with.
[time=579] Advent may be something you're completely unfamiliar with.
[time=583] If you'll remember back as we approached Resurrection Sunday, if you'll remember back to Easter this past year, in the spring, we gave ourselves to an extended six week, I believe, time of what we called the preparation.
[time=598] And it was a time of preparing for what was going to come with that great celebration of the Resurrection.
[time=606] Advent is very much like that, and some have even called it the waiting.
[time=610] And let me just, I'm not gonna read this all.
[time=612] I'm so thankful for Karen Beck.
[time=614] Karen Beck is a part of our family.
[time=616] Karen Beck not only wrote this for all of us this morning, but the study materials, the reading, the advent reading guide, the opportunity that you'll have as of next week to begin to on your own or with your families or friends to kind of track through these next four weeks that lead up to Christmas, all the scripture reading, all the projects that are gonna be on that little booklet you're gonna get.
[time=642] That's all from Karen, just her gift to this family, her using her gift, and we're so thankful for that.
[time=649] Flip this over to the back side.
[time=651] Let me read that top paragraph.
[time=653] Please do not miss this.
[time=654] Read the whole thing, not now, but later today, read this whole thing before your head hits the pillow tonight.
[time=662] Everybody read this whole thing.
[time=664] It's really, really good.
[time=665] Let me read the top of the back part.
[time=667] The ancient church fathers divided the calendar year into church seasons.
[time=674] Maybe you knew that, maybe you didn't.
[time=676] From the earliest days, God had instituted times of feasting and fasting for His people.
[time=682] He called them to set aside days to remember, to seek His face, to celebrate and to sacrifice.
[time=690] These practices strengthened them individually and corporately as a family.
[time=695] They reminded them of who God was and who they were.
[time=699] The warp and woof of their lives was dictated by Sabbath worship, sacrificial living and communal celebration.
[time=707] With the coming of Jesus, many of these practices were eliminated, but they were quickly replaced with disciplines that would help the new followers of Christ.
[time=717] Remember what their great God had done for them.
[time=720] Marking seasons is a way of readying our hearts to receive from God and worship Him more fully.
[time=728] Not surprisingly, the first season in the church year is Advent, and so in the four weeks preceding the birth of our Lord, we have an opportunity to anticipate the first coming of Jesus while being reminded that He will also, what?
[time=745] Come again.
[time=746] Instead of allowing a calendar to dictate we only have 28 shopping days left.
[time=752] We can now be reminded that we have 28 days to prepare.
[time=756] 28 days to prepare our hearts to welcome God's Son, our Savior.
[time=762] So you'll be given some material next week.
[time=764] We will each and every Sunday, leading up to Christmas.
[time=768] We'll even take a portion of our worship service and dedicate it to some remembrance, some scripture reading.
[time=776] We'll have an Advent wreath and some candles.
[time=779] And again, it's not all about the ceremony, but it's about the heart behind the ceremony and the opportunity we'll have as a family.
[time=786] And I mean this to maybe prepare for this Christmas celebration in a way and at a level that we haven't in the past.
[time=795] And so I hope you'll join us.
[time=797] Hope you'll be a part of it.
[time=798] I hope you'll pick up a book.
[time=799] Next week, we'll make sure to make those available to you.
[time=803] Hey, while you're at it, pull out the other insert in there.
[time=805] I wanna read this to you.
[time=806] This is just a every week, you know, I get the privilege of studying every week.
[time=811] I get the privilege of listening to things every week in my preparation for this time with you.
[time=817] I have the privilege of coming across things that sometimes, you know, make their way into our discussion.
[time=825] Sometimes they don't, but this was something I just wanted you to see.
[time=829] I just wanted you to read it with me.
[time=830] I wanted you to be reminded.
[time=833] We've been taking a great deal of time in recent days to articulate the great value and benefit of following Jesus.
[time=842] If you've been around here for the last few months, you know, that's true.
[time=845] We've been identifying what we've called the elemental patterns and rhythms of our Lord's life with the hopes of modeling our lives and our values and our homes and our relationships and our ministry here at Blackhawk even after the example of our Lord and those that followed after him.
[time=866] So before we jump into our discussion, we're gonna jump right back in where we left off last week on yet another elemental implication.
[time=876] I wanted to read this to you.
[time=877] I found it this week.
[time=878] It's basically just an elemental reminder for you, okay?
[time=883] And it's entitled The Life of a Disciple, Dallas Willard.
[time=887] And I would just encourage you to listen and pay attention to every single word.
[time=894] It's really, in my opinion, that good.
[time=897] Here we go.
[time=898] Nothing less than life lived in the steps of Jesus is adequate to meet the longing of the human soul
[time=910] or the great need of our world.
[time=913] Now I wanna remind you right there that message right there, that first sentence is completely and absolutely the opposite message of what you and I hear each and every day.
[time=927] It is absolutely antithetical to everything that you and I hear and see in this culture that has been gripped by the message of the enemy for he would want you and I to think completely and absolutely differently.
[time=945] The truth is nothing less than life lived in the steps of Jesus is adequate to meet the longing of the human soul, yours and mine or the great need of our world.
[time=959] Any other offer, think about it, any other offer that you and I would receive fails to do justice to the drama of human redemption.
[time=970] It deprives the hearer of life's greatest opportunity and in turn, abandons this present life to the evil powers of the age.
[time=980] The correct perspective is to see following Christ, following after Jesus, not only as the necessity that it is,
[time=990] but as the fulfillment of the, listen, of the highest human possibility.
[time=996] Think of all that you hear and think of all that we see.
[time=1000] Think of all the messages that communicate to you and I, what the highest level of human possibility could be.
[time=1009] Think of what it looks like.
[time=1011] Think of all the money, think of all the fame, think of all the political gain, think of all the relational connections, think of all the sexual promiscuity, think of all the things, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the boastful pride of life that the enemy just sets out there for you and me and he says to you and me, now that's living.
[time=1033] And he says right here, the correct perspective is to see following Jesus, nothing less than life lived in the steps of Jesus as not only the necessity it is, but as the fulfillment of the highest human possibility.
[time=1053] And as a life lived on the highest possible plane of three things you and I long for, joy, fulfillment and reward.
[time=1065] Who in this room longs for joy, fulfillment and reward?
[time=1070] Raise your hand.
[time=1074] All of us today reminded, thank you, all of us today reminded that that joy, fulfillment and reward is found in following after Jesus.
[time=1084] Conditioning your life in mind, our hearts to the pattern
[time=1090] that he's left for you and I to follow.
[time=1093] I just wanted you to read it, I just wanted you to see it.
[time=1096] Elemental, God's designed for the life of a disciple.
[time=1101] We engaged last week in yet another one of our, what we've been calling elemental implications.
[time=1110] And what we mean by elemental implications is we've made our way through the five elements.
[time=1115] We'll come back to those again, I promise you that.
[time=1118] But as we made our way through those five elements, those patterns that Jesus left for us to follow after, it began to be very clear to me and those on our team that there were some implications, if you will, that we would need to come back to and give some time and thought to, some very personal things in your life in mind that would need to shift, that would need to change if we were going to truly embrace this kind of living.
[time=1145] There would be some things, not only personally, but even corporately as a family, as a ministry that we would need to adjust and change if we were going to truly embrace this elemental teaching.
[time=1157] And so we've just been kind of making our way back through several of these implications.
[time=1162] Last week, we came to the implication number three or four.
[time=1166] I can't remember where we are on our list, but it was the implication that we must regain the sense of awe, that those in that very first church lived with, that sense of awe, that being in awe of him, that they were always experiencing, that they were consistently experiencing, that they were perpetually experiencing.
[time=1189] We said regain, we said we must regain that sense of awe, and we said regain because last week, we all began to, as the morning went on, we all began to, I believe, agree with the notion that we had lost it.
[time=1205] And we began, I think, to agree with the notion that we had lost that sense of awe on a number of fronts.
[time=1211] One was the very definition of the word, and I'll remind you of that this morning.
[time=1214] Again, this is just right here, all by way of review.
[time=1217] The definition of the word awe led us to believe we had lost it, and the definition, you can see it there on the screen, a deeply rooted and active response, a deeply rooted, cognitive and visceral, mental and emotional, a deeply rooted, an active response that is both personal and corporate, mental and emotional.
[time=1241] It was a response that engaged their entire being.
[time=1246] Next slide goes on to say this, the word signifies being captivated.
[time=1252] The word signifies being absolutely enamored with God at work, with God at work, blown away by his miraculous activity, blown away by God's miraculous movement in and among the hearts and lives of people.
[time=1268] The very definition of the word led us to believe that we've lost that sense of awe, and the grammar of the sentence.
[time=1276] Remember that?
[time=1277] The grammar of the sentence led us to believe that we had lost this sense of awe, and I'll take you back to Acts 243.
[time=1286] When we talk about the grammar of the sentence, let me just remind you of what we mean by that.
[time=1291] For it says there in 43, every one kept feeling.
[time=1295] You see that?
[time=1296] Every one kept feeling.
[time=1298] Kept feeling, a sense of awe.
[time=1300] That kept feeling is written in the present act of tense.
[time=1303] We talked about last week how the present act of tense and the original Greek signify something that when it begins, then continues on with an ongoing, never ending fashion.
[time=1316] Something that is perpetual, something that is consistent, something that never ceases.
[time=1321] And they kept feeling a sense of awe.
[time=1324] They felt a sense of awe, and they continued to feel a sense of awe.
[time=1328] They didn't stop feeling a sense of awe.
[time=1330] It was perpetual and consistent.
[time=1333] The definition of the word and the grammar of the sentence led us to believe that in all honesty, that isn't our experience.
[time=1341] That's not what you and I are known for as you look at your existence in your relationship with him as I look at mine, as we look at our relationship as a family.
[time=1352] There is, as you look at that, I believe something missing.
[time=1357] We've lost that sense of awe.
[time=1359] How did that happen?
[time=1360] We began to kind of venture down that road last week.
[time=1363] We talked about a number of things.
[time=1365] I wanna just add a couple of more this morning before we talk about how it is we can gain that sense of awe back.
[time=1371] Again, by way of review, we talked about our unhealthy fear of the miraculous.
[time=1377] Our unhealthy fear of the miraculous.
[time=1380] What has happened?
[time=1381] We've kind of lost a sense of awe.
[time=1384] We've not engaged very much in this being in awe of God at work because for a long time, being in awe of God or being in awe of the miraculous has been kind of pigeonholed over here to mean tongues, healings, prophecy.
[time=1402] We talked about that.
[time=1404] And we've talked about last week how in our theology, in our doctrine, in our understanding of God's word and those issues, there have been times where we've watched that activity going on and not just the activity, but then we also talked about how many times those who have led in those arenas have done that stuff in ways that have been very confusing, very manipulative.
[time=1431] And so over here, we've sat kind of looking at that, a bit confused, perplexed, fearful at times and concerned.
[time=1439] And so I believe, and I'll explain this to you in just a moment, I believe in response to that, we've kind of hunkered down and closed our eyes to the miraculous.
[time=1450] And I'll explain that to you in just a moment.
[time=1453] Unhealthy fear of the miraculous.
[time=1455] Unhealthy substitution, we talked about that.
[time=1459] We don't live in a consistent and perpetual, present, active, tense, being in awe of God because we've swapped out little A awesome stuff for big A capital A awesome stuff.
[time=1475] What do we mean by that?
[time=1476] Last week we said we've classified things as awesome.
[time=1479] We've classified hip hop as awesome.
[time=1483] We've classified country and rock and classical.
[time=1486] You name it, we call satellite radio awesome.
[time=1489] We talk about awesome movies, we talk about awesome restaurants, awesome football heroes, movie stars, cars, homes, vacation spots, we're in awe of stadiums, we're in awe of mansions, we call Taco Bell awesome.
[time=1503] Can I hear an amen?
[time=1508] Forgive us God, for we have sinned.
[time=1513] Starbucks is awesome, we're in awe of chocolate, we're in awe of academic achievements, we're in awe of pizza, we're in awe of art and jewelry.
[time=1521] And they, they were impressed by God.
[time=1529] They called God awesome.
[time=1534] They were blown away by him.
[time=1537] They were blown away by his work in their midst.
[time=1544] The substitution thing has gotten us into some trouble.
[time=1548] We talked about, and we ended last week with this unhealthy spiritual hearts, if you're taking notes you can write that down.
[time=1553] Unhealthy spiritual hearts have led us to a place where we have lost that sense of awe and I tried to explain it to you just as clearly and as succinctly as I could when a heart is detached from him, when a heart isn't growing in relationship with him, when a heart spiritually is getting smaller, not bigger, when there's distance between the heart and him, that heart and that life isn't impressed by him, that heart in fact isn't in awe of much of anything.
[time=1585] That heart is quickly becoming hardened in a spiritually unhealthy heart, spiritual hearts that are not on fire tend to be distracted and diminished.
[time=1599] Unhealthy spiritual hearts.
[time=1604] Let me give you two more, this morning.
[time=1607] And then we're gonna talk this morning about how we can gain that sense of being in awe of him back.
[time=1613] Here's one for you, add this to your list.
[time=1615] I believe we've lost that sense of awe due to an unhealthy view of the holiness of God.
[time=1623] Due to an unhealthy view of the holiness of God.
[time=1630] Now I could have said due to an unhealthy view of the attributes of God.
[time=1636] We could go that way and believe me my friends we could take some time and just go through.
[time=1641] Attribute after attribute after attribute of our God and you and I would be again reminded of his greatness and his vastness we would be in awe of all those things.
[time=1653] But this morning for the purpose of our discussion I picked one and the one I pick is the holiness of God and here's why.
[time=1660] I picked the holiness of God because of what the word holiness means.
[time=1666] Holiness is God's otherness.
[time=1673] Think about our discussion here.
[time=1674] Holiness is God's otherness.
[time=1677] Holiness is God's separateness.
[time=1681] Holiness is his supreme stand alone.
[time=1686] Ness if that's a word.
[time=1689] The holiness of God is his uniqueness.
[time=1694] You see God's holiness and again think of our discussion and the swapping out that we've done and the substitution thing.
[time=1704] You see his holiness my friends is his incomparable.
[time=1709] Everybody say that word one, two, three, go.
[time=1711] Incomparable, the holiness of God is his incomparable majesty and beauty and greatness and power.
[time=1721] Go back in your Old Testaments to Isaiah chapter six
[time=1728] if you would, would you do that?
[time=1729] Go to Isaiah six, a passage many of you in the room have no doubt read over the years.
[time=1738] Some of you in the room have studied this and gained and gleaned great insights for others of you in the room.
[time=1744] This is your first time in Isaiah.
[time=1746] Welcome, it is a, it's a great, great book and we find ourselves here in chapter six at a great passage that brings us great insights into the attribute of holiness, the holiness of our Lord.
[time=1762] Now let me give you a little backdrop.
[time=1764] Isaiah was a prophet of God, those who spoke for God to the people of Israel in chapters one, two, three, four and five.
[time=1777] Isaiah has been receiving the word that he is going to speak.
[time=1781] He has actually even started to communicate and deliver this prophecy, but he comes to chapter six and he stops to validate, if you will, to authenticate his message, to help the people understand how it is that he found himself in this place, having the honor and the privilege of being a mouthpiece for God himself and so he writes in chapter six how this all came to be and boy, it is an incredible scene.
[time=1809] It is an incredible picture that he paints.
[time=1812] Join me, would you?
[time=1813] In chapter six in the year of King Uzziah's death, I saw the Lord.
[time=1818] You ever wanna do that?
[time=1823] Ever wish sometimes.
[time=1825] My kids say it all the time.
[time=1827] Truth is, you and I probably think it a lot.
[time=1830] Boy, it would be just amazing to be able to see him.
[time=1834] Isaiah did.
[time=1836] In this vision, he seized the Lord, sitting on a throne lofty and exalted with the train of his robe filling the temple.
[time=1844] Seraphim stood above him, each having six wings.
[time=1848] With two wings, he covered his face and with two, he covered his feet and with two, he flew and one called out to another and said holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[time=1862] The whole earth is full of his glory and the foundations of the thresholds trembled, the foundations of the thresholds.
[time=1874] There we're talking about the construction of the temple.
[time=1878] There we're talking about the thresholds that fastened everything together.
[time=1883] The foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out while the temple was filling with smoke.
[time=1891] Then I said, whoa is me.
[time=1894] I don't belong here.
[time=1896] This is way above me.
[time=1897] This is beyond me.
[time=1898] This is otherness.
[time=1899] This is uniqueness.
[time=1901] Whoa is me for I am ruined because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts.
[time=1914] Let me just explain a couple things to you there, just briefly.
[time=1918] Isaiah says that he sees the Lord sitting on a throne.
[time=1921] That's the throne.
[time=1923] It's the throne of God, the throne there in the temple.
[time=1926] It says it was high.
[time=1928] You see it there in the first verse, lofty and exalted was that throne.
[time=1932] The throne was elevated.
[time=1935] The throne was greatly enhanced and elevated and placed above to emphasize the authority and greatness of the most high.
[time=1944] Seraphim, right there in verse two.
[time=1946] Seraphim stood above him.
[time=1948] Seraphim, this is an elite order of angels.
[time=1951] This is much like the cherubim that you see in Ezekiel seven.
[time=1954] These seraphim, we also see later in Revelation.
[time=1959] And the text says that the seraphim had six wings.
[time=1963] Some of you know this, others if you don't, but I wanna make sure we're all on the same page.
[time=1966] Six wings, why six?
[time=1967] Well with two, they covered their face.
[time=1970] And with two, they covered their face because in the presence of the Lord God most high, in the presence of all that magnificent purity and power and greatness, they dare not what?
[time=1983] They dare not even gaze upon him.
[time=1986] They dare not even look.
[time=1988] They dare not even think about what would happen if they even thought about looking at him.
[time=1995] And so they exist in this perpetual state of two of the six wings covering their faces.
[time=2002] Because of that which they were in the midst of.
[time=2005] With two, they covered their feet.
[time=2007] Why'd they cover their feet?
[time=2011] As a parent of five kids that seemingly have been young and small forever.
[time=2016] I understand this one.
[time=2018] There are places that we've gone at times.
[time=2023] There are homes that we've been invited into.
[time=2027] There are settings that we as a family have been able to go and attend this or that.
[time=2033] There are times when the seven of us are racing up to this door and getting ready to go in.
[time=2039] And then it dawns on you what you're going into.
[time=2042] It dawns on you how nice it is.
[time=2045] It dawns on you how different it is.
[time=2047] It dawns on you, the place you're about to go into is holy.
[time=2051] Holy as in other than normal.
[time=2055] Holy as in separate than what you're used to.
[time=2058] And I can't tell you, those times where in those moments we've just said, "Whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop." Take off your shoes.
[time=2066] Because we know where your shoes have been.
[time=2068] We know what your shoes have stepped in.
[time=2070] We know what's been going on with your shoes for the last day or a few hours.
[time=2074] And there's just this picture that we get of these angels with those wings over those feet because they realize they're on holy ground.
[time=2083] This is a holy setting separate other than normal.
[time=2088] And we treat it differently with two they flew.
[time=2091] I love this, I read about it this week.
[time=2093] With two they flew as to always one commentator said, "So as to always be ready to serve." That's the picture there of them always flying.
[time=2103] They never sat down, they never took a break.
[time=2106] They were never back in the back room.
[time=2108] You with me?
[time=2109] They were always hovering, they were always flying.
[time=2111] They were always right there, ready to serve.
[time=2114] Eyes covered, feet covered, flying to be there.
[time=2118] All because the Lord God was that spectacular.
[time=2124] All because the Lord God was that worthy because he was that awesome.
[time=2128] And as they flew, they called out to each other, "He is holy, holy, holy, holy," they said.
[time=2138] It's called a trihagion, a trihagion, a three-fold hebraic repetition.
[time=2146] You see in the hebraic, in the language of the day, one holy would have been used to express that idea with clarity.
[time=2157] Two holies would have been used to express severe emphasis.
[time=2162] In a trihagion, in the three-fold repetition, three was almost unheard of.
[time=2170] The level at which this takes the description is almost grammatically hard to even describe or imagine.
[time=2178] So there's the picture for you.
[time=2181] The Lord himself, your Lord, and mine sitting on the throne in the temple, which was huge, by the way.
[time=2192] With the train of his robe, what did the text say?
[time=2197] With the train of his robe covering the floor of the temple?
[time=2201] Did it say that?
[time=2202] No, it said the train of his robe was what?
[time=2205] Say it louder.
[time=2207] Filling, filling up the temple, the train of his robe, filling up the temple above him and on his sides, two majestic beings, angels with six wings gloriously and majestically proclaiming his great uniqueness, his set of partners, his purity, his holiness.
[time=2225] And as all that goes on, don't forget verse four, back to Isaiah six, four, and the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him, the foundations, my friend, we're talking about inanimate objects here.
[time=2241] We're talking about the glory and the greatness
[time=2248] and the majesty being so severe and the response in the room being so severe that now we've got wood and stone shaking.
[time=2257] And then I'm reminded, got a DVD from a friend this week.
[time=2270] I know, so thankful for it.
[time=2274] And it reminded me of, and we don't have time to take you there in an in-depth way, but I'm reminded from Revelation four, just listen, listen real close, all right?
[time=2284] Revelation four and five.
[time=2285] Here's the description in Revelation four and five of that very same throne, that very same Lord.
[time=2290] It says his voice in Romans in Revelation four, it says his voice on the throne is like that of a trumpet.
[time=2297] He who sits on the throne was like jasper and sardius in appearance, there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance.
[time=2308] John goes on to say that in that throne room, 24 elders are sitting clothed in white garments and golden crowns out from the watch this, out from the throne where the Lord sits.
[time=2321] It says in Revelation four, five came flashes of lightning and sounds and peels of thunder.
[time=2329] There was in front of the throne, he goes on to say a sea of glass like crystal.
[time=2337] And on that sea of glass like crystal stretching out for living creatures full of eyes in front and behind so as to never be able to be out of sight of the one they worshiped.
[time=2351] These four living creatures had, how many wings?
[time=2354] Six wings, it goes on in chapter five to say that there were myriads and myriads of angels.
[time=2364] Too many to count, worshiping him there in that setting.
[time=2369] Isaiah shows us the two closest to him.
[time=2373] Revelation five goes on to talk about hundreds of millions, hundreds of millions, jasper and rubies and rainbows
[time=2385] and lightning bolts and thunder and seraphim with wings
[time=2392] and a voice like a trumpet.
[time=2394] And we live in awe of tacos.
[time=2400] We're gonna go home today and watch a game
[time=2408] and go whoa, that's awesome.
[time=2410] I think we've lost that sense of awe
[time=2417] because I think to a large degree we've lost our view of God and we'll talk about getting that view back in a moment.
[time=2426] Let me give you one more thing.
[time=2428] We're kind of running tight on time.
[time=2430] So bear with me here.
[time=2431] I'm gonna kind of pick up the pace.
[time=2432] I believe we've lost one last reason that we've lost that sense of awe and I hope you're writing these down.
[time=2442] This last one I would just say is unconfessed sin.
[time=2447] I would just write that down, unconfessed sin.
[time=2450] Unconfessed sin leaves us distant and detached
[time=2456] from that place of intimacy and interaction with God.
[time=2459] You know that's true.
[time=2462] Unconfessed sin, when pursuing sin we miss out on God.
[time=2469] When pursuing sin we miss him.
[time=2471] When pursuing and living in unconfessed sin this view of him is diminished.
[time=2476] This view of him is distracted.
[time=2479] We are distant.
[time=2481] When we are distant our view of him and his activity is hindered our perspective of him as clouded and unclear.
[time=2487] When you and I live with unconfessed sin
[time=2494] sin he knows about.
[time=2497] Sin he, sin he watched us commit.
[time=2504] Sin that he watched us think about.
[time=2508] And yet we want to somehow act and live as if he didn't see it.
[time=2515] And we're somehow keeping it from him.
[time=2518] And it hinders us.
[time=2521] I just found this in between services.
[time=2524] I don't know if they can get it up on the screen real quick but look at Psalm 40.
[time=2529] Go to Psalm 40 12.
[time=2531] I hope I wrote it down right.
[time=2533] Yeah, I did.
[time=2534] Like a Psalm 40 12.
[time=2536] Turn back in your Bibles if you would to Psalm 40 12.
[time=2539] The Psalmist understood this my friends.
[time=2541] The Psalmist knew how sin had a way of diminishing his view of and relationship with God.
[time=2550] It says in Psalm 40 12 for evils beyond number have surrounded me.
[time=2556] My iniquities have overtaken me so that I am not able to what?
[time=2561] See, they are more numerous than the hairs of my head and my heart has failed me.
[time=2567] This powerful graphic description of what it's like to live surrounded by and still in sin.
[time=2575] I think we've lost our sense of all because too many times we can't see him due to the fact that there's things in your heart and mind that block that view.
[time=2586] How do we get it back?
[time=2591] Every bullet point you've got up above on how we lost it.
[time=2594] Now I just simply address those very same things below it, okay?
[time=2599] So if one of the reasons we've lost this sense of awe is an unhealthy fear of the miraculous then I would submit to you this morning that I think one thing we can do here is I think we need to redefine miraculous because for too long miraculous we've allowed miraculous to be defined by others as simply and only healing prophecy and tongues.
[time=2627] And I think that's a weakened view of the miraculous.
[time=2632] Now don't get me wrong, I believe in the core of my being I believe, let's take healing.
[time=2640] For instance, well I'll ask you, who in the room believes that God heals?
[time=2646] All right, so we all believe in the miracle of healing.
[time=2650] I believe in the miracle of healing.
[time=2652] I believe God heals.
[time=2654] I've seen x-rays.
[time=2656] I've seen tumors that were there this week that all of a sudden are gone next week.
[time=2661] I've seen it.
[time=2661] I sat, stood in a hospital room with a dear friend of mine,
[time=2668] Bill, sitting right back here.
[time=2669] How long's it been, Bill?
[time=2670] How many years?
[time=2672] Two, two years ago.
[time=2675] Our good friend, Bill Archer, has been a part of our family.
[time=2679] He's given leadership as an elder, he's given support to me as a friend.
[time=2682] You weren't in good shape, were you?
[time=2687] Yeah, we, I felt as if from what I was hearing that we were about to lose, Bill.
[time=2695] And Linda called and Bill and her together asked that the elders do what it says to do in James 5.
[time=2702] And I remember crowding into this little Park View hospital, you know, hospital room with him on his last leg.
[time=2710] And it talks about anointing, you know, with oil.
[time=2713] And we do that, you know, we go as elders and we anoint people with oil.
[time=2717] And I remember that day with my love for him, wishing we had like a bucket.
[time=2722] I was going to pour it over his whole bed.
[time=2724] And we had a little, little glass thing, you know, and I was just dumping it on his head.
[time=2730] And we were just rubbing it on his head and we prayed, we prayed our hearts out.
[time=2735] We begged God to heal, Bill, if that would be God's will.
[time=2740] Was it the next day?
[time=2744] It was within hours that his complete and total medical condition flip flopped.
[time=2752] And within days, within days from being on the brink, he's back to life and still with us today.
[time=2759] Now I say that, listen.
[time=2761] I say that because I believe that God heals in a miraculous way today.
[time=2767] But Bill didn't come up here and I didn't whack him on the head.
[time=2772] I don't heal.
[time=2773] You can come ask me to heal you.
[time=2776] I can't heal you.
[time=2777] I can't blow on your face.
[time=2779] I can't hit you, give you some cloth that I prayed over.
[time=2782] I don't think it happens that way.
[time=2784] I believe God heals and that is miraculous.
[time=2786] So please don't take my comments as I wanna get away from celebrating the true and genuine miracle of God.
[time=2794] I think though, that we've just been too stuck on those.
[time=2797] And I say redefine miraculous because you and I can, I think, be encouraged in our awe of God when we realize the many miracles that are going on in our midst.
[time=2811] Do you know what a miracle is?
[time=2812] A miracle is somebody who's clean.
[time=2821] I mean, not using.
[time=2822] A miracle, my friends, is somebody sober who's not drinking.
[time=2830] Anybody in the room who has any clue of what goes on in the soul of a person when they are gripped by the enemy and the power of addiction that that enemy brings.
[time=2842] Anybody in the room who knows the darkness of days and nights lived in the hopelessness of addiction.
[time=2850] Anybody here who knows what it's like to be freed from that by the power of God, by the power of His Word, by the encouragement of His people.
[time=2860] In the Black Church two weeks ago, I'd hear some AMNs right now.
[time=2866] Anybody who knows what that's like would be able to with me because I know what that's like, because I've seen it.
[time=2873] We would be able to call that what it is, a miracle.
[time=2880] You know what a miracle is?
[time=2881] A miracle, God's movement among His people.
[time=2886] You know what a miracle is, a miracle is a marriage today in light of the temptations and in light of the struggles that are present in this culture that you and I live in today.
[time=2899] In light of all the things that the enemy brings, the onslaught of attack against marriages.
[time=2904] And I'm not saying we should applaud people for staying married.
[time=2909] I'm not saying we should applaud people for doing what they should do.
[time=2912] I'm not talking about that.
[time=2913] I'm saying I want to applaud God at work in miraculous ways where left to ourselves we'd be toast.
[time=2921] Marriages, if you're married five years, if you're married two years today and you're still at it and you're still trying your best to love God and love each other, miracle.
[time=2934] Praise God, we should celebrate five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years we should bow and worship.
[time=2940] No, I'm just kidding.
[time=2941] But you get my point, God at work in those setting, you know what a miracle is today?
[time=2947] A miracle is today, a 16 year old with all that they see and all that's presented and all that comes at them.
[time=2954] I know they should do this.
[time=2956] I'm just saying God at work in the life of a 16 or 17 or 18 year old who stands up and says, I want to be pure.
[time=2964] I really want to be pure.
[time=2966] I really don't want to do this.
[time=2967] I want to love and honor God and be pure with my body and my mind.
[time=2971] It's a miracle, we should celebrate it.
[time=2973] We should say thank God.
[time=2975] Do you know how many of you in this room, you want to know what a miracle is, you're a miracle.
[time=2982] Do you understand that if you know him?
[time=2985] Do you understand that if you've fully surrendered your heart and life to him and your life?
[time=2990] I don't know all of you.
[time=2991] There are some of you in this room and how you grew up and what you were exposed to, what they did to you, what you endured, all that you've survived.
[time=3005] And you're telling me you're here in this room with a heart open to the word of God and a joy in your spirit because you love being here with us, you with where you've been.
[time=3018] It's a miracle.
[time=3021] God at work, God's movement among us and we should celebrate it more often.
[time=3027] We should talk about it more frequently.
[time=3029] We should be in awe of him.
[time=3031] We should redefine the miraculous and have a great time celebrating it, amen?
[time=3036] We should relegate car.
[time=3038] Gotta pick up the pace and end here real quick, relegate cars, stakes and the cults to their proper place.
[time=3044] That's back to the whole substitution thing.
[time=3046] We gotta stop it on the, we gotta get, gotta get a little A stuff, little A stuff.
[time=3050] We can't make little A stuff, big capital A, awesome stuff, work on that.
[time=3054] We gotta develop a healthy spiritual heart.
[time=3058] Okay, we're gonna end with this.
[time=3060] And this is quite an ending.
[time=3062] I'm gonna admit that to you.
[time=3063] This is quite an ending, not me, but what you're gonna see here.
[time=3067] Go back to Acts two.
[time=3069] Develop a healthy spiritual heart.
[time=3073] That's obvious because we would lost the sense of awe because we had because we had unhealthy spiritual hearts.
[time=3078] But I want you to see a healthy spiritual heart and how it's in awe of him right here in our text.
[time=3087] And there's a little twist.
[time=3089] I wanna make sure you don't miss.
[time=3090] Okay, Acts two, 43.
[time=3092] Look at 43 first.
[time=3093] For the longest time, I always thought that everyone kept feeling a sense of awe because there were many wonders in what?
[time=3102] I mean, you read that in what is actually kind of an unfortunate English translation.
[time=3110] You read that everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonders and signs were taking place.
[time=3115] I have for years connected.
[time=3118] The being in awe to the wonders and signs and really only to the wonders and signs.
[time=3124] But here's the thing.
[time=3127] When you read the text in the original language, what happens is it reads like this.
[time=3133] And listen, it reads like this.
[time=3134] Now go to 42.
[time=3136] They were continually, okay, wait a minute, that should be a little light going off right there.
[time=3142] Continually, what tense do you think that's written in?
[time=3146] Present active.
[time=3148] So here the present active is already showing itself.
[time=3151] They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching.
[time=3156] They were gathering in settings like this and giving themselves to the life-changing word of God.
[time=3163] They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship continually living life and experiencing life together in rich, biblical community, loving and being loved, serving and being served, knowing and being known.
[time=3179] They were continually devoting themselves to these things, to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, which in that context is communion and to prayer, through the teaching and through fellowship and through communion and prayer.
[time=3193] Now watch how this reads in the original language, to the breaking of bread and to prayer and everyone kept feeling a sense of awe, semicolon.
[time=3204] There it is.
[time=3207] Semicolon, which grammatically, semicolons are grammatically used to clarify for the most part, the end of a thought, though not completely terminated.
[time=3226] Meaning there may be some things coming that are connected to that thought, but for the most part, you've come to the end of the thought, which means they were always in awe, but what were they always in awe of?
[time=3239] Or why were they always in awe?
[time=3242] Mostly because of 42.
[time=3247] Yes, because of 43, but mostly because they gave themselves to these fundamental and elemental spiritual disciplines of the body and as they gave themselves to the teaching and as they gave themselves to fellowship and as they gave themselves to times of communion and worship and as they gave themselves to prayer, they were always in awe.
[time=3271] Your heart and mind has to be engaged.
[time=3276] The wonders and signs were awesome.
[time=3278] And they were in awe of that as well, but don't miss the holistic view of these two great verses.
[time=3286] You want to get it back?
[time=3289] Lastly, read Isaiah six.
[time=3291] Read Revelation four, read Revelation five.
[time=3295] This week, read Isaiah six and Revelation four and Revelation five every day and get a renewed, oh my goodness, kind of like view of him.
[time=3307] It'll blow you away and it will remind you of how big and great and majestic and pure and awesome he really is.
[time=3315] And lastly, and I'm gonna have you stand, if you will, and I wanna just in the quietness of this last moment, just have you do the last thing on the screen there.
[time=3326] Lastly, you may be missing out on a life lived in awe of him because you have sinned in your heart and life that hasn't been confessed.
[time=3334] And let me just ask you to bow your heads and we're gonna get out of here, so let me just say this as you bow your heads with your eyes closed.
[time=3342] Oh God, we come before you this morning and we would just ask that you would give us the courage to say to you things that need to be said, God, to confess, to agree with you about that, which has been done, that which has been thought, that which has been engaged in God, whether it's overt, whether it's inward, however it is, wherever it took place with whomever it took place, God, whatever the sin might we be willing to trust you, to speak it to you, to say it, to ask God for your forgiveness so that our hearts and our souls can be again white as snow.
[time=3387] God, we want to be a people that would live in awe of you
[time=3393] and we want to remove God, any hindrance, any barrier.
[time=3396] So God, would you give us the courage?
[time=3400] Would you give us the willingness to trust others, even around us who might support us in our movement away from the sin, which moves us away from you, which moves us even further away from this life lived in awe of you?
[time=3417] Oh Father God, we love you.
[time=3419] We pray for courage as we leave this place.
[time=3422] This may be a confession God that needs to happen privately and the quietness of our own soul.
[time=3427] God, it's a confession that may need to happen in community in relationship with others.
[time=3432] Father, we thank you for the privilege of knowing that in our confession, our sins are forgiven, that relationship with you is restored and our vision of you is made new all over again.
[time=3447] Thank you for our time this morning as we continue God in this study, in the days to come.
[time=3452] May we have the courage as a people with these implications of elemental God.
[time=3458] May we have the courage to be the church that you've called us to be, to be the people God that you sent your son to die for.
[time=3466] This model, this pattern that he left for us.
[time=3469] May we follow that with great zeal and with great commitment.
[time=3474] Life lived in the footsteps of Jesus, like nothing else we could ever, ever imagine.
[time=3481] And all the people in the room agreed and said, "Hey, men." (upbeat music)
[time=3511] (upbeat music)
