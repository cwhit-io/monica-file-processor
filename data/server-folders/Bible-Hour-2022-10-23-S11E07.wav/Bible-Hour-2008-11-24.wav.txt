[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Hey everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] My name's Kelly Bird and as always, it's a pleasure to be with you and I'm so thankful to get to have my buddy, Jeff Carroll, with me this morning.
[time=41] Some of you who have been around the Bible Hour or the Blackhawk family for a while know that Jeff is the senior pastor at Union Church in Huntington and also a very good friend of mine and we're here together today.
[time=55] Can't wait for you to see what God has put on our hearts as we get a chance to share continued implications from our elemental series.
[time=65] Today we'll be talking about the implication of how it is we handle our finances.
[time=69] Jesus and those first disciples gave us a great example of how to handle our finances and we can't, Jeff and I can't wait for you to see the message today.
[time=80] I want to, Jeff though, to just take a minute and catch all of you up on what's going on at Union Church these days.
[time=86] I know it's a lot and I'm so encouraged as I see Jeff and that incredible team continue to give themselves to that ministry and Jeff, just share with the folks, some of the things that are encouraging to you as you watch God continuing to work there in the Huntington area.
[time=103] - First of all, it's exciting to be back here at Blackhawk again today and it has been an amazing ride at Union, God has blessed us tremendously.
[time=110] We've added another campus.
[time=112] We have four services now on the weekend starting on Saturday night and going through Sunday night.
[time=117] We've added another service on Thursday night also that's just totally devoted to prayer and just asking God to move in our city and in our region and we're just excited to see the lives that have been changed, the new people that have come and accepted Christ and it's been an amazing ride out there in the middle of nowhere.
[time=137] God has blessed us tremendously and it's just exciting to be here with you today, Kelly.
[time=141] - Yeah, it's great to have you here and it is in the middle of nowhere.
[time=143] Let me just reiterate that.
[time=145] It's an amazing place.
[time=147] Had a chance to be there a couple weeks ago and spent the whole weekend teaching and being with the folks there at Union while Jeff was gone, an incredible family of people and God is doing amazing things.
[time=159] If you live in that Huntington area and you're watching the broadcast today, I would strongly encourage you to check them out.
[time=167] 400 North out in the middle of a cornfield and then downtown Huntington at the vine, great, great opportunities.
[time=175] We'll have Jeff and the Union Church website information right here on the screen for you today.
[time=182] Give them a call, go to the website and we're so thankful for Jeff, for the Union family and I'm so grateful that we get to be together today.
[time=191] Hey, God bless you.
[time=191] Have a great week and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=194] [MUSIC - 19 seconds]
[time=218] Understatement.
[time=219] [MUSIC - 32 seconds]
[time=253] You showed us your grace, you've been our helper, our liberator, the giver of life with the man.
[time=267] We will remember, we will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your man.
[time=282] We will stop, and give you praise, for grace that's made for me.
[time=293] When we walk through, life starts its valleys, we will look back at all you have done.
[time=305] We'll shout it out, and we will shout, our God is good, and He is the faithful one.
[time=316] Hallelujah, hallelujah, to the one, and to the one, and to the one, and to the one.
[time=343] We will remember, we will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your hand.
[time=355] And we will stop, and give you praise, for grace that's made for me.
[time=366] So think back to that time, when He saved you, when He first called out your name, let's sing about it.
[time=373] And I still remember, the day you saved me, the day I heard you call out my name.
[time=386] But you said you loved me, and would never leave me, and I've never been the same.
[time=397] We will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your hand.
[time=410] And we will stop, and give you praise, for grace that's made for me.
[time=420] So we will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your hands.
[time=435] And we will stop, and give you praise, for grace that's made for me.
[time=456] Hi, I'm Corbin Miller, the worship pastor at Blackhawk Ministries, and I'm a guest here with me this morning.
[time=462] This is Amy McIntosh.
[time=464] Good morning.
[time=466] Amy is a key volunteer in our creative arts ministry, and I've asked her to tell you just a little bit about our production coming up Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=474] We've been working really hard for the past couple of months, and are really excited that it's almost here in just a couple of weeks.
[time=479] December 19th is a Friday evening performance.
[time=483] December 20th, there are three performances on that Saturday, and then Sunday the 21st, there are two performances.
[time=489] That's right, for the past 32 years, Blackhawk Ministries has been involved in presenting a Christmas gift to the Fort Wayne community.
[time=498] And the gift is a production here at our place, and we just want to invite you to come and participate in that.
[time=503] We've had hundreds of volunteers literally being involved in rehearsals for the last couple of months.
[time=508] We have a 20-piece volunteer orchestra, a 50-member volunteer choir, a 20-member volunteer kids choir, and over a dozen actors and actresses that have just been working.
[time=518] They're tails off in order to get ready for this.
[time=521] So we really want you to consider being involved in the audience this year, because we can't do it without you.
[time=527] We want you to come see what we've been working on.
[time=530] We have a little video clip here for you to take a look at what it's been like the last couple of years, so watch this.
[time=548] [MUSIC]
[time=559] Well, hopefully that video clip shows you a little bit of what to expect at Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=565] And Amy, I think I noticed your face in that clip, a couple of different times.
[time=569] I wondered if you could take a minute to describe to our viewing audience what it's been like for you as a volunteer in Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=576] Sure. It's something that I look forward to every year and really enjoy doing.
[time=581] The rehearsal time is fun just to be with friends and fellowship and get to meet new people from Blackhawk.
[time=586] But then you get to the performances, and it's just such a fun way to get to minister to people in the community.
[time=592] I've just always loved it and really enjoyed doing it.
[time=594] And we're so thankful for you, Amy, and the hundreds of other volunteers that helped make Christmas with Blackhawk happen.
[time=600] Now, Amy, if they're interested in getting a ticket, could you describe to them the two different ways to do that?
[time=605] Sure. You can go to our website and click on the CWB logo.
[time=610] In the top left-hand corner, click on CWB Tickets.
[time=613] There's just a little bit of information for you to fill out, and then you can just print your tickets right there.
[time=618] Another way you can do it is to go to our North Campus lobby, Monday through Friday from 8 to 5.
[time=624] Yeah, just pick up your tickets there.
[time=626] We ask that if you do come to the show, that you bring your ticket with you, which is free, no charge to you,
[time=632] but then also that you bring a canned good item.
[time=635] We like to collect canned good items at each of our productions, and we'll make sure that those get redistributed to places like the Community Harvest Food Bank and the Rescue Mission
[time=644] and different churches in town that help make sure hungry people get fed this time of year.
[time=649] Thank you for your willingness to participate in that, and we hope to see you at one of the shows.
[time=656] Everybody say hello to Pastor Jeff Carroll. Many of you know Jeff.
[time=662] Some of you may not. Jeff was here and spoke for me this summer.
[time=666] You may know that Jeff's just become, over the last few years, a very good friend of mine, a huge encouragement in my life.
[time=675] I love getting to spend time with him. We meet together once a week.
[time=679] He's pastor of a church out in Huntington. Church's called Union Church,
[time=685] and what God has done in and through Jeff and the team out there at Union Church is really, really encouraging.
[time=694] So many things more than we could really get into this morning.
[time=697] I think since maybe the last time you were here, tell them about the new campus that you guys have opened and what that's been like.
[time=704] We opened a new campus called the Vine Campus. It's right downtown Huntington.
[time=709] We meet on Sunday night, and we have reached a whole new group of people that we feel like we had never reached if we wouldn't have opened up.
[time=718] If you've never been to Union Church, it is kind of out in the middle of nowhere.
[time=723] It's the middle of a cornfield. It is the middle of a cornfield.
[time=727] I'm telling you, this year is beans, but next year would be corn.
[time=730] This year has been beans and corn, but it kind of goes vice versa every year.
[time=736] You don't know that part.
[time=737] See, I didn't know that.
[time=738] I thought it was corn.
[time=739] Yeah, no, it goes vice versa.
[time=741] But anyway, it has been an incredible ride, and God has blessed us tremendously.
[time=749] But we're excited about the two campuses that we have.
[time=751] We have four services now on the weekend, and just last month, I just have to tell you, we had a hell's maze, we did a hell's maze last month, and had an incredible, incredible turnout.
[time=762] Over 2,600 people, we had to shut it down the last night at 12, 10 a.m.
[time=766] There were still people coming through.
[time=768] That's like a maze out in the cornfield.
[time=771] Yeah, it was. That part was.
[time=773] Yeah, it was amazing the cornfield.
[time=775] And last month, we had over 202 people give their heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=780] It was incredible months.
[time=782] That's awesome, incredible months.
[time=787] And in case you're not picking up on it, Jeff's from Paducah, Kentucky.
[time=792] Another thing I love about Jeff is I just love listening to him talk.
[time=796] And you'll be blessed by that today as we keep going here.
[time=801] We are going to do our very best this morning.
[time=804] To really, in a sense, just continue in a discussion that we've been in for a number of weeks.
[time=809] We're coming back to the Elemental Series.
[time=812] We're kind of taking some time to talk about and teach on some of the implications.
[time=818] If we're going to be a family, if you're going to be an individual disciple,
[time=824] and if we are going to be a community of disciples who pattern our lives, really,
[time=831] pattern our lives, pattern our living, pattern our faith community here,
[time=837] that Blackhawk, what God has us doing, if we're going to pattern our ministry and pattern our lives after him, we're going to be encouraged and inspired
[time=847] by those in that very first church who pattern themselves after him,
[time=853] then there are some things that you and I are going to have to give some real thought to.
[time=857] We've determined as a family, there's some things we're going to have to just honestly come back to and be willing to open up our hearts and our lives and our minds to what it is God would have, things that may need to change, adjustments that you and I may need to give ourselves to.
[time=874] And so this morning, we want to talk to you about some things that we've seen, and I'm going to continue this discussion probably for the next couple of weeks.
[time=882] We're going to talk about what we see in the Gospels, what we see in this first church,
[time=888] what we see early on as it relates to finances, as it relates to the resources that God has made available to you and to me,
[time=898] the resources that he has always made available to his people.
[time=902] We're talking about time, talent, and specifically this morning, we're going to talk about treasure, and we don't make any apology for that.
[time=909] If you've been around Blackhawk, you know that we don't shy away from talking about money.
[time=914] Money is not something that kind of has a bad rap around here.
[time=919] Giving isn't something that has a bad rap. We don't avoid it.
[time=923] We talk about it when we need to. We talk about it when the text calls for it.
[time=928] We talk about it whenever we come to it.
[time=932] And this is something that as we've looked through the Gospels in the Book of Acts, we've seen Jesus. There was a way Jesus approached money.
[time=941] There was a way the first church approached their resources.
[time=946] And I think there are some things that you and I can learn.
[time=949] There are some things that you and I can be reminded of.
[time=951] As we talked about it, Jeff and I, we thought it might be good just to give you kind of some perspective
[time=959] into what's been going on just in recent years as it relates to this issue of giving,
[time=966] as it relates to this issue of stewardship, or the way, you know, the church today, the evangelical church, if you will, is handling its resources.
[time=975] It just so happened this week. Christianity today came out with a cover story on stewardship,
[time=982] a cover story, a lengthy article on the issue of giving why we're not putting more in the offering plate
[time=989] and then it has underneath it in parentheses and it has nothing to do with the economy.
[time=995] And as I began to read this, even just this morning, I came across this, I'll read this to you, American Christians and their lack of generosity.
[time=1005] And again, hear me now. This is not a slap on the wrist.
[time=1009] This is not meant to be, I'm going to, we're going to read some statistics here and we're going to jump into a brief discussion that will set us up for some more discussion next week.
[time=1018] This is not a slap on the wrist. This is not a shame on you.
[time=1022] This is not a, you know, you're all in the dog house. This is just, hey, listen and open your heart
[time=1028] and let's together be reminded as a family of what God's design is for this area in your life.
[time=1036] The Word of God speaks to the issue of money as much as it speaks to the issue of salvation.
[time=1041] It's something really important for us to consider.
[time=1045] And I'll, you know, I'll humbly say it. I hope you'll humbly say it.
[time=1052] Left to myself. I don't do so well on this front.
[time=1058] Left to myself, left to ourselves. I don't think we do so well on the generosity front,
[time=1066] on the faithful giving front, on the mindset front as to how we're going to keep all this in, you know,
[time=1073] in check when it comes to the way we spend or the way we save or the way we view money.
[time=1078] So just, again, listen, be encouraged, be challenged.
[time=1083] American Christians lack of generosity might not be as shocking if it didn't contrast so starkly
[time=1091] with their astounding wealth. Passing the plates researchers, passing the plate was an organization
[time=1098] of Christianity today engaged for the purposes of this article and study.
[time=1102] Passing the plate's researchers say committed American Christians.
[time=1107] Committed American Christians, those who say their faith is very important to them
[time=1113] and those who attend church in that same demographic at least twice a month,
[time=1119] passing the plate researchers say that that group of people earn more than $2.5 trillion a year.
[time=1129] On their own, this demographic of evangelical Christians could be admitted to the G7,
[time=1136] the group of the world's seven largest economies.
[time=1140] Smith and his co-authors estimate that if these Christians gave away 10% of their after-tax earnings,
[time=1148] they would add another $46 billion to ministry and ministry needs around the world.
[time=1157] We looked up some of the information found on the website under the Barna group,
[time=1165] found some interesting statistics here as it relates to this issue of stewardship and giving.
[time=1171] The proportion of households that tie, then we're going to talk about the tie in just a moment here.
[time=1177] The proportion of households that tie giving at least 10% of their income to ministries,
[time=1184] and in this case, it's dealing with local churches.
[time=1187] The proportion of households that tied their income to their local church dropped by 62% in the past year,
[time=1197] from a whopping 8% in 2004 to now just 3% engaged in that discipline the following year.
[time=1210] The households in the year 2001, 70% of American households gave, again,
[time=1217] this is in relationship to their local churches and it comes under the banner category of Evangelical America,
[time=1224] 70% of American households gave on an average $1,075.
[time=1231] Can you imagine that?
[time=1232] For the whole year, 1,075 dollars.
[time=1235] I don't know about you, but we have, if you have an animal, and we have a lab dog that's very expensive, I didn't know lab dogs could be so expensive, it's a big dog in the house too.
[time=1249] I guarantee that's your problem right there.
[time=1252] That is, it's in the house, I know.
[time=1254] I bet we spend more than $1,000 taking care of our dog this year.
[time=1259] Just think about getting them groomed, the medicine that my dog takes, the food, everything else.
[time=1265] So that means we will spend more on giving to their dog than they would to our Lord.
[time=1275] That is mind-boggling to me.
[time=1278] Barna goes on to say that in Evangelical homes, again, people committed to their local church,
[time=1286] it says that giving has ranged in the last five years, giving has ranged between that home,
[time=1296] that giving unit, if you will, giving between 1.7% and 1.95% of their personal income over a given five-year span.
[time=1309] Decline in average giving per person in the United States, again, Evangelicals involved in local churches,
[time=1317] the average giving per person in the US dropped 15% between 2004 and 2005.
[time=1325] Those making between $40 and $60,000, again in Evangelical America, those making between $40 and $60,000 on an average gave 2%.
[time=1338] Those making $60 to $75,000 a year gave 1% down a half percent from the year before.
[time=1348] So some things just, I think just set our minds, I don't know if that hits home, I don't know if that's convicting,
[time=1355] I don't know if that's encouraging, I don't know.
[time=1357] Really, you know, we don't talk a lot about money, do we, you and me?
[time=1363] I'll talk to you a lot about my family, you'll talk to me a lot about your job, you'll come in talking about your marriage,
[time=1372] we'll talk about our kids, we'll talk about some really, really dicey stuff.
[time=1378] I mean, we'll get into, we'll talk about things in your life and mine, won't we?
[time=1383] But when was the last time you brought your checkbook in to my office, or when was the last time I sat down with you and showed you Cabra and I's, you know, quickening stuff?
[time=1394] We just don't talk about it, we just don't talk about it, we just want to keep all that really, really, really private.
[time=1404] And we just want to do our best this morning again to begin to help you and I figure out this is something that's part of following him.
[time=1411] This is something that's right in line with all the things we've been talking about, Jesus had some things to say.
[time=1417] The early church established some patterns for you and I, and I think it's good for you and I to talk about it, it's good for you and I, to be honest about it.
[time=1426] And so we don't make any apologies for this, we're thankful for the chance to talk with you about this, and we hope it's encouraging to you.
[time=1434] Let's just begin by going back to the beginning, okay? This could take eight weeks, we'll just take a few minutes.
[time=1440] Let's just try, Jeff and I are going to try and give you here this morning, just kind of an overview perspective on some of what God's word has to say.
[time=1447] Some of what God's design was, even from the very beginning on how this whole giving thing was to work, okay?
[time=1453] So go back to your Old Testament, go ahead and put your finger in back there at about numbers, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus numbers, and we'll come back to that in just a moment.
[time=1466] You know, as I read this week, as I studied and gave some thought to this, as Jeff and I did that together, several things became very clear about money and ministry.
[time=1477] When you begin to read through the Scriptures, even way back here at the very beginning in the Old Testament, one can see and one can begin to immediately sense that God cared deeply about how His people handled their resources.
[time=1491] It was clear, very clear, and what was equally clear from the get-go is that He put in place a mechanism. He puts in place a guide, if you will, to help His people hold their possessions and their resources loosely.
[time=1507] He puts this mechanism. He puts this guide, if you will, in place to help those people not only hold those resources loosely, but He helps the people give those resources worshipfully.
[time=1521] I hope you caught that. From the very beginning, He puts a mechanism in place that mechanism was called a tithe, and we're going to show you that here in just a moment.
[time=1531] And it was that tithe, that mechanism that He put in place that helped people from the very beginning hold their resources loosely while giving those resources worshipfully.
[time=1543] The tithe is a word that means a tenth. You can write that down. Tithe means a tenth.
[time=1549] And as you study the Scriptures, you begin to see that there were actually three tithes that the people of Israel were held to, three tithes that He instituted, three tithes that from the day they were born.
[time=1565] Listen, this is just how they lived. It's just how they functioned. It's just what they did. It was just their view of the economy of God and the family of God and how all that came together.
[time=1578] Three tithes that the people of Israel took part in, and if you're doing the math real quick, you're right.
[time=1585] 30% actually was a little bit more, but for numbers sake, we'll just keep it at the 30% of what they made went right back into this family of God that they were uniquely and divinely appointed to be a part of.
[time=1605] Three tithes. Here you go. The Levitical tithe. Let's start there. Numbers 18, go to Numbers chapter 18, and I'm going to pick it up in verse 21.
[time=1618] Numbers 18, 21. The Levitical tithe that says there to the sons of Levi, "Behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance."
[time=1632] The inheritance for the Levites, the inheritance for those who did the work of ministry would be the tithe that they received.
[time=1641] See, most of the folks in Israel had been given the promise of land. It was the promised land that they would inherit.
[time=1649] For the Levites, God says, "No, I'm going to give them the tithe of the people in return for their service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting."
[time=1660] See, from the very beginning, there was a place that the people of God met. From the very beginning, there was a building, if you will.
[time=1666] In this case, it was a tent that housed their corporate worship. They gathered and did things privately, they gathered and did things in smaller settings.
[time=1675] That's true, but the people of God gathered in the great tent, and it was the ministry of the Levites that took place there.
[time=1682] The sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die. Only the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity.
[time=1696] It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the sons of Israel, they shall have no inheritance.
[time=1705] For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as an offering to the Lord, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance.
[time=1714] Therefore, I have said concerning them, they shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.
[time=1721] The Levitical tithe. This is what was given to support those who did ministry.
[time=1728] Levites, the priests, were the ones who ministered to the people. They taught them, they counseled them, they led them in worship, they prayed for them, they buried and married them.
[time=1739] This was how God supported those He had called in a special and unique way into the arena of service and ministry to His people, the Levitical tithe.
[time=1751] Secondly, go to Deuteronomy 14, or I'll read it off the screen for our folks. Deuteronomy 14, 22, this is the second tithe.
[time=1760] It was the agriculture or the produce tithe. You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you sow, which comes out of the field every year.
[time=1771] Tithing what comes out of the field, tithing what they grew, tithing what they raised. This is a very interesting thing.
[time=1782] Listen, God wanted His people to periodically gather together for times of feasting, times of worshipful celebration.
[time=1793] It's the original potluck dinner, if you will. This is where carians got started. God had it in the design for His people that they would come together for times of fellowship and worship.
[time=1806] There was to be a feast, there was to be food provided, there was to be an atmosphere of celebration, convocations, they called it.
[time=1815] And it was the tithe of the people, from the produce, from the things they raised, from the stuff they grew, from the crops, from the animals that got given that allowed for that to happen in a huge and remarkable way.
[time=1829] There was the Levitical tithe, there was the agriculture or produce tithe, and then there is thirdly right this down, the benevolent tithe.
[time=1838] This is really important, watch this, Deuteronomy 14, 28 and 29.
[time=1843] At the end of every third year that you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in that year, and shall deposit it in your town.
[time=1852] They leave out because he has no portion of inheritance among you, and the alien, the orphan, and the widow who are in your town shall come and eat and be satisfied.
[time=1862] It also says in Deuteronomy 2612, it says when you have finished paying all the tithe of your increase in the third year, the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, this is describing this third tithe.
[time=1882] You shall give it to the Levite, so the Levites, the priest got an extra portion every third year, and then watch this to the stranger as well, to the orphan and to the widow that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied.
[time=1901] I love what it says there in 13, "You shall say before the Lord your God I have removed the what, the sacred portion from my house."
[time=1912] What did they give them? Did they give them the worst, or did they give them their best?
[time=1919] I shall, "You shall say before the Lord your God I have removed the sacred portion from my house, and also have given it to the Levite, and the alien, and the orphan, and the widow according to all your commandments which you have commanded me.
[time=1936] I have not transgressed." So this is a sin issue, this is serious. If you didn't do this, I have not transgressed or forgotten any of your commandments, the benevolent tithe, every third year, an extra tithe collected, stored up for the meeting of real physical needs of those in that community, those in that family
[time=1965] that would need it. Here's the point on this, a lot of points on this. Let me just say this this morning. Do you sense, can you begin to see that from the very beginning what he wanted for his people, he wanted them to function with this great sense of family, he wanted them to function in this great sense of community, he wanted them to understand that they were not consumers, they were not on their own, they were not autonomous, they were not detached or distant from.
[time=1994] They were together in this thing with each other and with him. And their willingness and their readiness to give was what formed the foundation of that community's effectiveness and their witness.
[time=2012] God from the beginning used financial giving as a means of worship. He used from the beginning, he used giving to support and further ministry. And those who did the ministry, he from the beginning used giving as a means of benevolence, a way of meeting the very real physical needs of the family of God.
[time=2038] And part of what's going on here and part of what's going on with all the stats is that we've lost that.
[time=2049] You're on your own. I'm taking care of me. You try your best to take care of you. You know, these guys better take care of this place because I got things I got to do.
[time=2062] I got things I'm involved in. I've got commitments I've made. I'm extended here. I've got this. I've got that.
[time=2068] And we've lost that sense of family. We've lost that sense of community. We've lost that sense of together being part of something that's way beyond us.
[time=2080] And what we're a part of, even though it's a little different than this Old Testament picture and just going to get to that in just a moment here, is uniquely similar.
[time=2090] And I think there's some room for you and I to give some thought to coming back to this picture of God's economy and God's family and how the two work together.
[time=2099] That we talk about tithes here in the Old Testament, Malachi 3. He very directly and very pointedly talks to his people.
[time=2110] He talks to you and me about the time. Listen to what he says.
[time=2114] One of the things that I think we need to do is start claiming the promises of God. There is promises all through Scripture and we need to stand on the promises.
[time=2135] Let's look at this.
[time=2145] You are cursed with a curse for you have robbed me. Even this whole nation bring all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be food in my house.
[time=2155] And I like this right here and try me. I think King James says, "Test me. Test me now in this," says the Lord of Host.
[time=2164] Here's the promise.
[time=2166] If I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.
[time=2178] Now, I don't know about you, but I think we're going to get a much better return from God Almighty than we are from the stock market.
[time=2186] See, what we got to do is start thinking of an eternal perspective, not earthly perspective.
[time=2193] Whether the stock market crashes tomorrow or not, it doesn't matter who the president is. It doesn't matter any of them things because my God said he would supply all of our needs according to his riches and glory.
[time=2206] And so whatever happens tomorrow in this earthly sense does not have anything to do with me because my God, when I get my feet up on the floor tomorrow morning, he said he's going to supply my needs.
[time=2217] Isn't that a wonderful thing? That is a wonderful thing. See, what we are, you are what you plan.
[time=2228] If you don't plan nothing, I live out in the cornfield as he says. If we don't plan nothing, let me just give you some Kentucky English. We ain't going to get nothing.
[time=2240] So, God is saying, "Hey, I want to pour out a blessing. You cannot do kingdom business unless you sow into kingdom business."
[time=2249] He gave you everything. He gave you his son. He died a terrible death for you. He gave you all. And what we want to do, what we want to do is we want to tip God.
[time=2264] Y'all still love me? We want to tip God. That's what the statistics are showing.
[time=2273] You know, let's see what I got in my wallet today. I'll just give you a little bit. I don't know. I was, when we got married and I got married at a very young age, when we got married, we made $8 an hour combined.
[time=2287] My rent was $150 a month in 1984. We had a two bedroom apartment. That's all we had. But I'm going to tell you what, we still wrote that check.
[time=2300] Why? Because it's not that we have to. It's because it's obedience. It's I love you for what you've done for me and I want to give back just a portion of what you've given to me.
[time=2316] I trust you. He's saying to you this morning, "Will you just test me? Will you just..." I want to do all this for you. I want to give you so many blessings that's going to blow your mind. You can't imagine what I want to give you.
[time=2333] Will you just test me? And I'm going to open the windows of heaven. That's a promise that we can take from God Almighty, Kelly. That's a great promise.
[time=2348] And I know many of you, I know many of you like me in the room, many of you have had to wrestle with that thought. Many of us have had to wrestle with knowing what in our hearts or in our guts, we feel like we want to do, not necessarily even should do, what we want to do in terms of a gift, in terms of our offering, in terms of our giving back, many of us in the room wrestle with that.
[time=2377] That wanting to give combined with the reality of a number of things where our spending has taken us, pressures of an economy, that's true, but God says it really clearly right there.
[time=2402] Don't rob. He uses really harsh terms. Don't rob me. When you think all that through and you end up on the cautious side, when you think all that through and end up on the selfish side, you are robbing me. He says, "Don't go ahead, test me and let me bless you." Interesting in Proverbs, go to Proverbs still in the Old Testament, just giving you some things to think about.
[time=2427] Many of you know this. For others of you, it might be new learnings. Proverbs 3, 7. Oftentimes when you hear, and when I hear Proverbs 3, we think Proverbs 3, what? 5 and 6.
[time=2438] Interesting as you study just those first several verses of Proverbs 3, this is actually all one contextually, it's all one thought. Trust in the Lord, Proverbs 3, 5, trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[time=2452] Do you hear what Jeff was just saying? Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and don't lean as you're thinking through that gift, as you're thinking through how you're going to function in this world financially as a follower of Christ.
[time=2468] Don't lean on your own understanding. In all your ways, acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. The thought continues in verse 7. Don't be wise in your own eyes.
[time=2480] Fear the Lord, turn away from evil. It will be healing to your body and refreshment to your bones.
[time=2487] In verse 9, honor the Lord from your wealth. That's all one thought in the Hebrew. Honor the Lord, trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding.
[time=2506] Honor the Lord from your wealth and from the what? Say it out loud. Say it louder. From the first, we've talked about this before, the first fruits offering that God's people were encouraged to make, this first offering that I'm encouraging you and I to be making in our approach to this.
[time=2529] It's just really simple. When the corn got picked, or the beans, when the calf got, whatever got harvested, whatever came in, they had bills to pay. They had commitments and obligations. What went to God went to God first.
[time=2552] There was no, there was no getting down to the bottom of the barrel, trying to figure out if we can now scrape enough to take the church on Sunday.
[time=2563] Because what was God, the gift that got made and the gift that was going to be made and the commitment to make that gift again, and again and again, that check got written, that corn got put aside first.
[time=2577] And I just think that's a great, not only is it a great reminder for you and me as adults, we were talking about this first hour, we think it's a great example for your kids.
[time=2587] I think it's fantastic for you to talk with your kids about, your kids know you make money, your kids know you earn, your kids know you have wealth, wealth being, you know, you got money in the bank and you're paying your rent or your mortgage, you got a car, you know you're wealthy.
[time=2604] Your kids know that you've got some and so you and I have to be faithful to help our kids understand that that check that we write, that gift that we make, that support that gets sent.
[time=2615] It gets sent, those gifts get made before, before the car payment, before the house payment, before the groceries, before anything.
[time=2625] What a huge picture you and I get to paint in their hearts and minds, as we help them understand bringing the whole tide, not robbing God, trusting God, not leaning on our own understanding, but being generous, responsive and worshipful
[time=2645] with these resources in this family, in this community that God has us in, where it really matters how we do this together.
[time=2656] So much more we can talk about in the Old Testament perspective, Jeff wants to share with you this morning just some insights that he's gotten lately from a passage in Luke, Luke chapter 8.
[time=2670] Yeah, Luke chapter 8 verses 2 and 3, real quickly go there, this will be our kind of our bedrock text that we'll finish up on today.
[time=2677] Luke chapter 8 verses 2 and 3, while you're turning there, one of the things that you need to be reminded of is that I'm reminded of is that we are a distributor for God Almighty.
[time=2690] It's all his anyway, some of y'all didn't hear me, it is all his anyway, see we got this consumerism attitude that it's ours, no, it's his.
[time=2702] It's all his, he gives us the ability to go work, he gives us the ability to earn money, he gives us that ability, so it's all his anyway.
[time=2710] So if he can trust us, if he can, if he'll test us and he, and we can be distributors that he can use and flow through us, there is no telling what God can do through us, but he's got to trust us.
[time=2724] So let's look at, let's look at Luke chapter 8 verse 2 and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons.
[time=2737] Now I want you to look at just a couple things, these are women that we're going to talk about that gave to Jesus, that supported his ministry.
[time=2745] It first of all, it says certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities.
[time=2750] This is an unnamed group of women, we have no idea who they were, but we do know that they gave liberally to Jesus.
[time=2757] See, they had an encounter, once you've been healed by Jesus, you're going to be different.
[time=2766] Some of us maybe have been saved too long to remember who you used to be, who he brought you out of.
[time=2772] But when he has healed you, when he has brought you up out of something that you know you shouldn't have been in, when nothing else could satisfy you, beer, alcohol, sex, whatever it was, could not satisfy you.
[time=2784] When he brought you out of that, I'm going to tell you, these women knew that he had touched them and these women supported who brought him out of something that no one else could.
[time=2798] These certain women gave all they had to Jesus and supported his ministry.
[time=2804] When you have an encounter with Jesus Christ, let me tell you, you're different.
[time=2809] If you are not different, if you've had that encounter and you're not different, let me say to examine, as David said, examine our hearts today.
[time=2816] Because you want to give back to someone who gave everything to you, everything.
[time=2823] Then we see in verse 2 Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven devils.
[time=2828] So out of whom in the Greek means that Jesus had literally drive out each and every devil out of her.
[time=2836] Again, she had an encounter with Christ and look what happens.
[time=2840] Mary was present at the crucifixion.
[time=2842] Mary was among those who prepared Jesus' body for burial.
[time=2846] She was among the first to see the empty tomb.
[time=2849] She was the first to go out and tell people that Jesus has been resurrected from the dead.
[time=2855] Evidently, Mary had a lot of money, but I'm going to tell you, when God touched her, she was with Jesus to the very end.
[time=2864] How can you quit on Jesus?
[time=2866] How can you have an encounter with Jesus Christ and just say, I just quit?
[time=2872] That blows my mind.
[time=2876] How you can have that encounter and just quit.
[time=2880] Look at verse 3, let's see verse 3 here.
[time=2883] "So here we have Joanna that is from a dignitary family and her husband is right there and he's handling a large sums of money.
[time=2893] Our Joanna here is the wife of Chuzah, which is a stirred, stirred means he was a person entrusted with the supervision of King Herod's wealth.
[time=2903] So here we have Joanna that is from a dignitary family and her husband is right there and he's handling a large sums of money for King Herod.
[time=2914] But she had an encounter with Christ.
[time=2918] Now we don't know how it happened, which is beside the point, but the point is once she had that encounter, she made sure she provided for the one who saved her.
[time=2932] She became a distributor of large sums to give to Jesus where he could do ministry, where that was not an issue for him.
[time=2941] And we see that Joanna was with Jesus to the very end. She was one of the ones that visited the empty tomb with Jesus.
[time=2948] And lastly, we see Susanna and it says many others.
[time=2951] This is the only mention, only reference of Susanna in the New Testament.
[time=2956] But I do know when it says that many others, there was great quantity.
[time=2960] There was great others that Jesus had touched and that had enormous assets and gave to him liberally.
[time=2969] Folks, if you think about some people that God touched, and Jesus touched in the Old Testament and New Testament,
[time=2978] when Jo, you think about Jo now, you think about Jo, all that he had.
[time=2983] And his wife even said, "Curse God and died and he lost it all." But he was still there. Why? Because he trusted God.
[time=2990] And then what did God do for him? Gave him back and more.
[time=2994] That's the top of God we serve.
[time=2996] We serve a great God.
[time=2998] Paul, a 32nd encounter with Jesus Christ, which arrested him on the way to Damascus.
[time=3005] What happened? He went from an atheist to, "Lord, is that you?"
[time=3011] And encounter with God changes you forever.
[time=3015] So God does not want our partnership. Listen to me as we close.
[time=3020] God does not want our partnership. He wants ownership.
[time=3025] And finances is not excluded. Listen, there is no plan B.
[time=3030] If we don't do it, it's not going to be done. God does not have a plan B.
[time=3035] If we don't give, it's not going to happen.
[time=3039] What good is worldly wealth if we have spiritual poverty?
[time=3043] What good is all this wealth? We thought we had it all.
[time=3046] The doubt was going up. Everything was going good.
[time=3049] And then what happened? We put our trust in something that is man-made.
[time=3053] We cannot put our trust in something man-made. We got to put our trust in God almighty who said, "I will supply your need. I will be there for you. I will never leave you nor forsake you." That's who we got to put our trust in.
[time=3064] And America is going to go back to their knees where the power is and come back to Jesus Christ.
[time=3070] And I'm excited about it. I'm excited about it.
[time=3073] Jesus said, in the Sermon on the Mount, do not store up for yourselves treasures on,
[time=3083] say it louder, on earth, where moth and rust and markets crash,
[time=3089] where thieves break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures in what?
[time=3095] In heaven. Be passionate about it.
[time=3099] Yes. He's getting in this passage here.
[time=3103] He's trying to make the point that he wants your heart and he wants my heart.
[time=3108] He wants us consumed with. He wants us mindful of.
[time=3112] He wants us making investment financially, personally, relationally.
[time=3119] He wants us making investments in things that will last forever.
[time=3123] That's right. Go to Matthew 19 real quick. Matthew 19.
[time=3130] Let's just make this point one more time, the rich young ruler.
[time=3133] What is it that God's after here, my friends?
[time=3136] What is it that Jeff and I are after? Do you think Jeff and I are after your money?
[time=3141] You're wrong. Jeff and I aren't after your money. We don't want your money.
[time=3145] I don't need your money. You know what? God doesn't need your money.
[time=3151] We kind of made this about money this morning, but this isn't about money.
[time=3155] This is from the very beginning of time, always been about one thing.
[time=3159] It's been about your heart, your heart.
[time=3162] So here's this rich young ruler, Matthew 19.
[time=3164] He says, "What must I do?" He comes and says to him, Matthew 19, 16.
[time=3168] He says, "Teacher, what good things shall I do that I might obtain eternal life?" And Jesus, I'm paraphrasing here. Jesus says, "You want to enter into the kingdom?
[time=3177] Keep the commandments?" And he said to him, "Which ones?" And Jesus said, "Don't commit murder.
[time=3181] Don't commit adultery. You should not steal. Don't bear false witness.
[time=3184] Honor your father and mother. You should love your neighbor as yourself." And the young rich young ruler said to him, "All these things I have kept.
[time=3192] What am I still lacking?" So Jesus realizing that he was dealing with the young guy who wasn't thinking clearly. That way too high of an opinion of himself.
[time=3203] Said to him, "If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and then come follow me." And there's that tragic verse 22, but when the young man heard this statement,
[time=3219] he went away, what, grieving for he was one who, what, owned much property.
[time=3227] Point there being, Jesus wasn't after. He said, "Go sell all your possessions." Jesus wasn't after his what? Jesus wasn't after his money.
[time=3235] Jesus wanted his heart. Jesus longed for his allegiance. Jesus wanted his devotion.
[time=3243] And he still wants yours and mine. And he knows today that what gets in the way
[time=3249] of your allegiance and your devotion and mine is this weird view of money
[time=3255] that creeps in at times and this disposition we have to hoard it or pursue it or chase it
[time=3263] or not spend it well or wisely or not give it.
[time=3269] Remember, we're going to talk about this for the next couple of Sundays.
[time=3274] This is a heart issue. It has to do with your checkbook. It has to do with, you know, it has to do with money. That's true, but this is about your heart.
[time=3285] And I want to just give you some time again over the next few weeks to give some thought to this individually and as a family for many of you.
[time=3295] You've heard some of this before. For many of you, this is a reminder.
[time=3298] Jeff and I were talking for some of you in the room, though. You may not even really know him.
[time=3304] And for you, there may be some things before money. There may be some things that you need to give thought to. And Jessica's going to close us.
[time=3312] What good is it to gain the whole world and lose your soul?
[time=3316] What good is it to have all this stuff?
[time=3321] You can put your bottles away. What good is it to have all this stuff?
[time=3328] And then when you die, you have no idea where you're going to spend eternity.
[time=3333] You know, as many funerals have I've done in 15 plus years of ministry,
[time=3341] I've discovered one thing is that death has not aged to it.
[time=3346] I have buried so many young people here recently.
[time=3351] And every time I go to the funeral home and meet with the family,
[time=3357] here's what they ask many of them. Jeff, where do you think so-and-so is today?
[time=3367] Now, they don't ask, even if it's a wealthy businessman, they don't ask, you know, how much money did they leave me? All the great wealth that he had or the prestige or the title that he had. I don't ever get that.
[time=3384] Here's what I do get. Jeff, just please tell me it happened. Please tell me.
[time=3392] Some I do know.
[time=3395] We have four services now. A lot I do not know.
[time=3401] But here this morning, grace is still active.
[time=3406] Grace means I don't deserve it, but I'm going to give it to you anyway.
[time=3411] But there's a day that death, that grace dies. There's a day mercy dies.
[time=3418] So today, let me ask you, you ever had that time in your life?
[time=3423] I call it a defining moment where time just stood still.
[time=3429] And you remember asking cross to come into your life?
[time=3433] I hear so many people talk about, "Well, Jeff, I've been a Christian all my life.
[time=3437] I know you have." What Jeff Mom and Dad said, "I'm not asking Mom and Dad.
[time=3443] They can't do this for you." "But Jeff, I've been baptized. I'm not asking that." Jeff, I was baptized. I was dedicated as an infant. No, I'm not asking that.
[time=3452] I'm a member of Black Health. I'm not asking that.
[time=3456] Here's what I'm asking.
[time=3459] It's appointed to man once to die and then the judgment.
[time=3465] Can you remember a time that you asked cross to come in your life?
[time=3472] And then you were different. You weren't the same.
[time=3477] That encounter with cross to change, just like it did with these women.
[time=3481] It changed their whole outlook on life.
[time=3485] If you are not one or a percent sure that you've ever known, that you ever asked cross to come in your life, the scripture says that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart, that God raised him from the dead, who you shall, here's another promise, be saved.
[time=3503] You shall be saved. It's a promise.
[time=3506] It is for each and every one of us. But today, we're not promised tomorrow, but today at this time is a defining moment in some of your lives.
[time=3515] It's a day that you'll remember and you're going to make a choice today.
[time=3521] Just say yes to heaven, or say no, and take that chance that you take your last breath
[time=3528] and you're going to be an internal damnation forever.
