[time=183] - Hi, I'm Corbin Miller, the worship pastor at Blackhawk Ministries and I'm a guest here with me this morning.
[time=188] This is Amy McIntosh.
[time=190] - Good morning. - Good morning.
[time=192] Amy is a key volunteer in our creative arts ministry and I've asked her to tell you just a little bit about our production coming up Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=201] We've been working really hard for the past couple of months and are really excited that it's almost here in just a couple of weeks.
[time=206] December 19th is a Friday evening performance.
[time=209] December 20th, there are three performances on that Saturday and then Sunday the 21st, there are two performances.
[time=216] - That's right.
[time=217] For the past 32 years, Blackhawk Ministries has been involved in presenting a Christmas gift to the Fort Wayne community and the gift is a production here at our place and we just want to invite you to come and participate in that.
[time=230] We've had hundreds of volunteers literally being involved in rehearsals for the last couple of months.
[time=235] We have a 20 piece volunteer orchestra, a 50 member volunteer choir, a 20 member volunteer kids choir in over a dozen actors and actresses that have just been working their tails off in order to get ready for this.
[time=248] So we really want you to consider being involved in the audience this year 'cause we can't do it without you.
[time=254] We want you to come see what we've been working on.
[time=257] We have a little video clip here for you to take a look at what it's been like the last couple of years.
[time=261] So watch this.
[time=262] (upbeat music) - Well, hopefully that video clip shows you a little bit
[time=289] of what to expect at Christmas with Blackhawk and Amy, I think I noticed your face in that clip a couple of different times.
[time=296] I wondered if you could take a minute to describe to our viewing audience what it's been like for you as a volunteer in Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=303] - Sure.
[time=304] It's something that I look forward to every year and really enjoy doing.
[time=308] The rehearsal time is fun just to be with friends and fellowship and get to meet new people from Blackhawk.
[time=313] But then you get to the performances and it's just such a fun way to get to minister to people in the community.
[time=319] I've just always loved it and really enjoyed doing it.
[time=321] - And we're so thankful for you, Amy, and the hundreds of other volunteers that helped make Christmas with Blackhawk happen.
[time=327] Now, Amy, if they're interested in getting a ticket, could you describe to them the two different ways to do that?
[time=332] - Sure.
[time=333] You can go to our website and click on the CWB logo.
[time=337] In the top left-hand corner, click on CWB tickets.
[time=340] There's just a little bit of information for you to fill out and then you can just print your tickets right there.
[time=345] Another way you can do it is to go to our North Campus lobby.
[time=349] Monday through Friday from eight to five.
[time=351] - Yeah, and just pick up your tickets there.
[time=353] We ask that if you do come to the show, that you bring your ticket with you, which is free, no charge to you, but then also that you bring a canned good item.
[time=362] We like to collect canned good items at each of our productions and we'll make sure that those get redistributed to places like the Community Harvest Food Bank and the Rescue Mission and different churches in town that help make sure hungry people get fed this time of year.
[time=376] - Thank you for your willingness to participate in that and we hope to see you at one of the shows.
[time=380] - God, may we have the faith that we see those characters in the Christmas story.
[time=388] God, may we have a bit of the faith that they had and that they displayed in Mary and Joseph and the Magi and the Shepherds and God, may we just, this time of year, remember that and may it increase our faith and our hope in you.
[time=405] And pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=408] [MUSIC - 203 seconds]
[time=614] - That's a great sound and a great time of year,
[time=628] my friends, for all of us who know the Lord a great, great time of year and a great opportunity for us as we sing about and teach about and talk about and celebrate the great truth of Christmas.
[time=642] We want to remind you this morning and we're going to have the drama team come and help with this reminder.
[time=648] Just a great reminder that while we celebrate the generosity of God in this season as he gave his only son and as we're planning things and taking part in things that celebrating communicate that it's so important that you and I in the everyday of life in the each and every circumstance, in the each and every setting, no matter where you are, no matter where I am, no matter who it is we might bump into or what circumstance we may find ourselves in, so important that we're always ready to communicate and live out this generosity, this kindness that the Lord possesses and watch this, listen to this and just be reminded to be so very careful with how we are in the situations of everyday life.
[time=701] - And I think we ought to have the choir
[time=711] where sparkly robes, all covered in sequence.
[time=714] - But don't they already have robes?
[time=716] - Yes, but they're so drab.
[time=718] I'd like to see them like glowing angels when the spotlight comes on.
[time=722] - This is starting to sound more like a Vegas Christmas to me.
[time=724] - No, no, I like it.
[time=725] You know, a Vegas Christmas, that's not a bad idea.
[time=728] - There you go, man, here's your hot water.
[time=730] - Thank you.
[time=731] - And we have a great selection of herbal teas to go with that if you'd like.
[time=733] - Nope, no, no, I got my own right here.
[time=735] - You sure you don't want to order anything to eat?
[time=736] - Nope, just tea.
[time=737] - No, oh, oh, thank you.
[time=739] - Here's your soup, sir.
[time=742] And can I get anything to drink other than just water?
[time=745] - No, just tea.
[time=746] - Do you have free refills on your drinks?
[time=748] - No, I'm sorry.
[time=750] - Then no thanks.
[time=751] - Oh, more rolls.
[time=752] Now, I was thinking then-- - Oh, waitress, bring more of those crackers too.
[time=757] The buttery kind, not the whole week.
[time=759] - Oh, sure, okay, so now what I was thinking was-- - Don't forget the lemon for my water.
[time=766] - Sure, I'll be right back.
[time=767] Okay, back to my idea, okay.
[time=770] Now, what I was thinking is that we could maybe-- - Hey, this is CWB, not the opening act of the Bellagio.
[time=778] Besides, we've got a budget to stick to.
[time=780] Well, can't we at least do something with the lighting?
[time=782] Oh, strobe lights, we've got to have strobe lights.
[time=785] - Well, we do have those laser lights that we used for Easter a couple of years ago.
[time=789] - Okay, all right, fine.
[time=792] - Hey, why don't we pray so Mark can get started with his soup.
[time=795] - I'll do the honors.
[time=796] Lord, we just want to thank the, or the opportunity to plan this wonderful outreach for those who are less fortunate among us.
[time=808] You have been so gracious to us.
[time=811] We pray that we can return your kindness to the world around us.
[time=815] Please bless this food to our bodies.
[time=818] And Lord, open our eyes to those around us who are in most need of thy presence.
[time=824] [AMEN] - Amen, thank you, so nice.
[time=827] - So, what did you find out about the CWB volunteers?
[time=830] - Oh, good news.
[time=831] I've got over 40 people ready and willing to sign up everything backstage to give you people seated so you can mark that off in the list.
[time=837] Sounds good to me.
[time=838] - It's amazing.
[time=839] You know, isn't it just wonderful when a whole church comes together and effort like this?
[time=843] - Oh, absolutely.
[time=844] - Let me smell.
[time=846] Waitress, waitress, I specifically asked for no garnish.
[time=851] I cannot stand pickles.
[time=854] - Yeah, pickles, I'm sorry, I wrote it on the check.
[time=857] I think the cook probably just overlooked it.
[time=859] - Yeah, maybe next time you need to write it in all caps.
[time=862] - Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
[time=864] You know what I'll do?
[time=865] I'll just, I'll put in a new one.
[time=866] I'll get you this out of your way.
[time=868] - Hey, I'll take it.
[time=869] I'll just put in order for another one.
[time=872] - You know, I, you've got to be able to take the bad with the good in life.
[time=876] That's what the Bible teaches us.
[time=878] - Mm-hmm, yeah, you're all right.
[time=879] - That's true.
[time=879] - Yeah, I'll be right back.
[time=881] - Oh, hey Gary, that looks really good.
[time=883] Can I invite her back too?
[time=884] - Sure, I'll cut you off a piece.
[time=887] - What?
[time=887] - Excuse me, waitress.
[time=890] - Yeah.
[time=892] - This knife has water spots on it.
[time=894] - Oh.
[time=897] - You want me to get you a new one?
[time=899] - No.
[time=900] - Please.
[time=901] - Okay.
[time=902] - Oh gosh, someone wrote one wrong side of the bed, huh?
[time=906] - Really?
[time=907] - Remember that come tip time.
[time=908] - You know, I think she needs to earn her 10%.
[time=912] - 10, you give 10.
[time=913] - Well, okay, now that we got good news about the volunteers, what about evening meals for the crew building the set?
[time=919] - That's more good news.
[time=920] I've got a full menu of meals coming all covered by the small groups.
[time=925] - Well, isn't that great?
[time=926] I mean, we just step out in faith and God just really blesses that.
[time=932] It's just amazing.
[time=933] - It is every time.
[time=934] - Oh no.
[time=934] - What?
[time=935] - Oh my goodness, we've got people coming to the church at 1.30.
[time=939] We've got to go.
[time=939] We've got to get back there and let them in and you guys have to help me unpack.
[time=942] I'm sorry.
[time=943] - Well, I guess we could take our sandwiches and eat on the run.
[time=947] - Okay, let's go.
[time=948] - Excuse me, waitress.
[time=949] If we get our check please and three takeout containers.
[time=952] - Four.
[time=956] - I'm so sorry guys, I'm so sorry we have to eat in the car.
[time=959] - Yeah, whatever.
[time=959] - That's all right.
[time=960] I'm just eating out of styrofoam.
[time=962] - Samish looks so good too.
[time=964] - Was everything okay with the food?
[time=966] - Yeah, we just realized we had to leave.
[time=970] - Okay, well here's your check.
[time=973] Thank you all very much and you have a merry Christmas.
[time=975] - Thanks.
[time=976] - You have me too.
[time=977] How much?
[time=979] - 1575.
[time=980] - I had the special.
[time=981] - She didn't charge for the hot water did she?
[time=982] - Nope.
[time=983] - You know, you better check the math.
[time=985] - Sure.
[time=986] - Could we get four separate checks please?
[time=989] - Just three.
[time=990] Oh three.
[time=991] - I'll get it.
[time=992] - Oh thanks, Sam.
[time=993] - Oh man, it's not worth something.
[time=995] You know, I have the perfect track for this.
[time=997] It's just wonderful for opportunities like this.
[time=999] - Good, okay, I'm gonna leave it for her.
[time=1001] - That's thoughtful.
[time=1002] - Okay, come on.
[time=1004] - I'll catch up with you after a bit.
[time=1007] Okay.
[time=1012] 10, 15, 16, wait a second.
[time=1017] 75, perfect.
[time=1024] Three separate checks.
[time=1028] Oh great.
[time=1029] No tip, merry Christmas to me.
[time=1042] Silver and gold have I none.
[time=1044] But such as I have, I give thee.
[time=1047] Submit your life to God's son and you'll have a great eternity.
[time=1051] Fantastic.
[time=1054] I just hope it's not eternity with all of you.
[time=1056] - That was well done and just a great reminder
[time=1063] to everybody, be careful, be thoughtful and make sure you're always remembering that we've said it before around here, every encounter, a divine appointment, every interaction, every person whose eyes you lock eyes with, everybody that you meet everywhere we go, we get this great opportunity to pass along the attributes of God.
[time=1087] - Well hey, if you were with us last week, you'll remember that in our discussion regarding financial giving and the life of a disciple, we raised the issue of tithing.
[time=1101] We talked about this principle of biblical tithing.
[time=1106] Tithing just by basic definition, you can see it there on the screen, is the giving, the setting aside of 10% of one's income or a home's combined income
[time=1119] to support God's ministry here and around the world.
[time=1123] Tithing, we saw how in God's design, with the people of Israel in the Old Testament, that he actually used three tithes, if you'll remember.
[time=1132] Three tithes were used in the Old Testament system as a way of God supporting his ministry mission and physically and spiritually caring for his people who were in need.
[time=1144] There was the Levitical tithe, there was the produce or agricultural tithe, and then there was the benevolent tithe.
[time=1153] And last week, I wanted to just come back to this this morning real quick.
[time=1156] Last week, I feel like I kind of misspoke in a sense, it happens every once in a while.
[time=1161] I misspoke in my use of a certain phrase, and let me take a moment here and just explain.
[time=1167] I said last week that in the Old Testament, God had provided the tithe as a guide.
[time=1173] It was the phrase I used.
[time=1175] That God had provided for his people in the Old Testament system the tithe, and that it was a guide for his people who learned how to hang onto their resources loosely while giving them and offering them worshiply.
[time=1190] Well, in the Old Testament system, I want to just make sure we're clear on this.
[time=1194] In the Old Testament economy, my friends, in the Old Testament design of God, the tithe was not a guide, the tithe was the law.
[time=1203] And it's important that we distinguish that this morning.
[time=1207] The tithe was the law, it wasn't a good idea, it wasn't a suggestion, it was God's requirement for his people.
[time=1216] As some of you in the room know this morning, God in the Old Testament required his people to live under the ceremonial judicial and moral law, it was known as the Mosaic law.
[time=1228] And tithing was part of that law.
[time=1230] Tithing was a mandate in that Old Testament system.
[time=1234] They had to do it, it was what God required, it was the law.
[time=1239] Now, thankfully today, most of you again in the room know this, others of you may not.
[time=1243] While God's people, the nation of Israel, lived under the law in the Old Testament, while there were requirements made of them, while there was a list of things that they were to do and a list of things that they weren't to do, while that was how it worked in the Old Testament.
[time=1260] And by the way, God used the law, we learn later, as a way of indicating and exposing our human need, because no one in and of themselves could ever keep the, what?
[time=1273] The law, the law was impossible for people to keep.
[time=1277] God used it as a picture, God used it as an example of the impossibility for humans to live up to the standards of God and the standards of God were ultimately met in the person of who, Christ.
[time=1291] What we understand today is that the law of the Old Testament has been fulfilled completely in the person and work of Christ.
[time=1299] Everything God demanded, everything God wanted, all the requirements of God met fully and absolutely in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[time=1309] Matthew 5, 17, you may know this verse, you can write it down, it says there do not think, Jesus said, do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets, I did not come to abolish, but to what?
[time=1322] Fulfill and in him fulfilling all of God's law, now you and I are not left with the burden of trying to somehow measure up.
[time=1332] Now you and I are not left with the burden of somehow trying to come through.
[time=1336] Now for you and I, it's not about keeping rules.
[time=1340] Now for you and I, it's not about following lists of do's and don'ts.
[time=1344] Now for you and I, it's about following Christ.
[time=1348] It's not about doing to earn salvation or favor because all of that has been done.
[time=1355] Done by the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[time=1359] So we live today in this New Testament era, we live in relationship with Christ himself, not in relationship to a list of rules.
[time=1368] We live in freedom, under grace.
[time=1372] Now God says, I still want you to honor me, I still want you to obey me, but not because it'll get you somewhere or earn you favor with me.
[time=1380] No, no, he says, obey my word, follow my principles because you love me.
[time=1385] Obey my word, follow my principles because you're grateful for what I've done and what my son has accomplished on your behalf.
[time=1394] Now in this New Testament covenant, in this New Testament era in which we live, we can bask in the wonder and freedom that the gospel provides and then move through life, obeying and marriage and purity and honoring parents and giving and serving and submitting and loving.
[time=1414] We can honor God's principles, not out of duty, but now out of gratitude.
[time=1418] Jesus Himself said, if you love me, you will keep my what?
[time=1423] My commandments.
[time=1425] So a little backdrop there, giving, tithing, if you will, initially and very much a part of the Old Testament law.
[time=1434] So now back to this discussion, many today will point out that it was clearly tithing.
[time=1440] It was clearly under the law and that because we're no longer held to that standard of the law, why teach about it, why talk about it, why encourage it, why use it in the context of the local church, the tithe is no longer applicable.
[time=1457] Some would argue that others will freely admit that in the New Testament, others will freely admit that in the New Testament, we are not obligated to nor commanded specifically or outrightly to tithe, but they will add, why not establish and strongly encourage tithing as simply a guide?
[time=1478] Now the use of the word guide would be appropriate.
[time=1481] And they say, why not?
[time=1483] Why not encourage tithing as simply a guide, a practical tool or help that gives people a God honoring target to shoot for in terms of their giving and their stewardship.
[time=1495] They would in essence say it's not like it's a bad idea.
[time=1498] So some will come at that from different points of view.
[time=1501] So here's my plan for today.
[time=1503] And I've never said this.
[time=1506] I don't think I've ever said this in over 20 years of teaching and trying to communicate the scriptures.
[time=1512] I've never said what I'm about to say.
[time=1515] But my plan today is I would like for you, I feel like we will have been successful today if you leave our time together this morning confused.
[time=1527] I would like to confuse you if you would allow me
[time=1533] the privilege of doing so.
[time=1535] I would like you to leave today with a sense of tension in your heart and soul.
[time=1540] I want us to wrestle in our own hearts and in our own minds before God with this issue.
[time=1547] And again, let me just say that's where this issue should begin, this issue should begin between you and him.
[time=1553] When we talk about resources and when we talk about finances and when we talk about how we handle them and how we view them and how we approach them and how we release them.
[time=1561] Clearly the Bible speaks of this being an issue that is initially between you and him.
[time=1567] And so I want you today to as we think this through be willing to wrestle with these thoughts and these principles.
[time=1574] I want you to be able to ask the question how should I, how should I individually, how should we as a family, fundamentally, foundationally, how should we come at this thing?
[time=1585] This thing being our personal approach to giving and supporting ministry.
[time=1590] And here's how I'm gonna confuse you.
[time=1592] I'm gonna give you five reasons why you should tithe.
[time=1596] All right, I'm gonna do my best.
[time=1597] These are just right out of some things.
[time=1599] I've studied this week, some material.
[time=1601] I've come across some passages that we find here in the scriptures.
[time=1607] I wanna give you five reasons to tithe.
[time=1609] Biblical reasons, practical reasons why it would be wise and God honoring and spiritually healthy and kingdom advancing for you to start or continue in your commitment to sacrificial tithing.
[time=1623] Okay?
[time=1624] And then I'm gonna teach you why I'm not so sure it's a good idea.
[time=1629] I'm gonna give you three dangers to tithing.
[time=1636] That I think every single one of us should be aware of and willing to wrestle with and consider.
[time=1642] So here we go.
[time=1643] Five reasons to tithe.
[time=1644] Get your pencils out, your pens.
[time=1645] Let's write a few things down.
[time=1647] Number one, tithing honors an Old Testament principle.
[time=1649] We talked about this last week.
[time=1651] I'll try and be brief.
[time=1652] Tithing honors the Old Testament principle of God providing for the ministers He called and the expenses of their ministry.
[time=1661] If you were with us last week, you'll remember that in the Old Testament, God designated one of the 12 tribes of Israel.
[time=1669] It was the tribe of what?
[time=1670] Levi.
[time=1672] The tribe of Levi was designated by God to be the tribe that would have the ministry of the tabernacle, the ministry of the tent of meetings, the ministry of the temple.
[time=1682] So instead of giving the Levites a portion of the land, which was what God had promised the people of Israel, all the tribes got a portion of the land.
[time=1692] It was always about the land.
[time=1694] God said that these uniquely called ministers, and you understand that, right?
[time=1699] Even though we're a priesthood of all believers and we've made a big deal in recent years around here about how there's maybe too much distinction between us at times, we still believe that.
[time=1710] But remember, there are those who have been uniquely called to fulfill a specific and unique purpose in that body, the purpose of teaching and leading, and preparing those in the family to do the Ephesians 4, 12, to do the work of the ministry.
[time=1729] That having been said, God said that those uniquely called ministers of the tabernacle should live off the tithes of the other 11 tribes, numbers 18.
[time=1740] You can turn there.
[time=1741] If you've got your Bibles this morning, numbers 18, pick it up in verse 20, numbers 18, 20, and 21, where God said to Aaron, you shall have no inheritance
[time=1755] in their land, nor own any portion among them.
[time=1760] I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel, and to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance in return for their service, which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting.
[time=1778] When we tithe, this is how we would come at it.
[time=1782] When we tithe today, we have the opportunity of honoring this very same principle.
[time=1787] Some of God's people are not called to do money-making, marketplace, business, if you will, in ordinary ways.
[time=1797] They are called to be pastors, ministers, missionaries, ministry assistants, and so on.
[time=1803] The rest of God's people are to be gainfully employed in order to resource the ministers and the cost of those ministries.
[time=1812] In the Old Testament, God laid down that this be done by the tithe.
[time=1817] Okay, we've been over that.
[time=1818] Now, the question can be asked whether Jesus in the New Testament continued this principle for the sake of his church.
[time=1826] And if you ask that, one of the strongest arguments that he did, in fact, continue in this way of thinking is found in Matthew 23, 23.
[time=1837] Matthew 23, 23, where he says, woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you, what?
[time=1845] Everybody say it out loud.
[time=1847] Say it louder.
[time=1848] For you, tithe, mint, and dill, and cumin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law, justice, and mercy, and faithfulness.
[time=1860] But these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.
[time=1866] Do you see that?
[time=1866] So Jesus endorses tithing.
[time=1870] He says, don't neglect it.
[time=1871] And while it is not as essential as justice, love, and mercy, it is to be done.
[time=1878] Okay, well, somebody might hear me say that, or listen to us discussing that and say, "Well, but he's only talking to Jews "and an essentially basically Old Testament setting, "the temple there." Well, maybe so, but if you turn to 1 Corinthians 9, which I'd encourage you to do, turn to 1 Corinthians 9, we see here in 1 Corinthians 9, 13, and 14, and Paul's letter to the church of Corinth, as he's talking with them and teaching them about the way they are to steward their resources and the way they are to support those that do the ministry of the church, seems to indicate that the principle of the Levitical tithe was still being preserved, at least.
[time=1922] Look at what it says there in 13.
[time=1923] Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the food of the temple?
[time=1930] Those who attend regularly to the altar have their share with the altar.
[time=1935] In other words, he reminds the church that in the Old Testament economy, there was this system in which the Levites who worked in the temple lived off the tithes brought to the temple.
[time=1946] Then he says in verse 14, so also, important phrase, so also, in just the same way, the Lord directed those who proclaimed the gospel to get their living from the gospel.
[time=1961] Now, at the least, okay, at the least, Paul is saying that those who spend their lives in the service of the word of God should be supported by the rest of their ministry family.
[time=1973] But since he draws attention to the way it was done in the Old Testament as the model, it seems likely that tithing could have been the early church guideline, if not the mandate.
[time=1985] Either way, when we tithe today, we honor a principle and plan of God that sustain the ministry in the Old Testament and quite possibly sustain the New Testament ministry as well.
[time=1999] Some food for thought, something to think about.
[time=2002] Let's move on to number two.
[time=2004] Tithing honors God as owner of all.
[time=2007] Write that down.
[time=2008] Tithing honors God as owner of all.
[time=2011] Here's the thought here.
[time=2013] When we release a tenth of our income, when we tithe and give it over to the ministry and mission of Christ and the world, we're honoring God by doing so.
[time=2024] We're honoring the God who owns everything, including all of our income.
[time=2030] Now, listen here.
[time=2033] One objection to number two.
[time=2036] One objection that some folks might have to this is they might say this, and I understand it.
[time=2041] They might say, "Wait a minute." Seeing, wait a minute, seeing a tenth of our income as uniquely or specially belonging to God, misses the point, they'll say, because Psalm 24 one says that, what?
[time=2058] Says that all our money belongs to God.
[time=2062] The earth is the Lord's and all it contains the world and those who dwell in it.
[time=2067] So those who object to the second point, say, "Wait, wait, wait a minute." Don't go saying that just giving a tenth is somehow unique or special.
[time=2076] It's all his.
[time=2078] Well, I understand that.
[time=2079] I think that's true, but think of it this way.
[time=2082] And I loved it when I came across this.
[time=2085] God knows this deeply.
[time=2087] He knows that there's something wrong.
[time=2090] And guys, just hang on here.
[time=2091] It's gonna be a little painful for a lot of us men in the room here, but this is just the example we're gonna use.
[time=2096] There's something wrong with the husband who answers the wife's complaint.
[time=2102] Sometimes a wife will feel this and sometimes a wife chooses to articulate this and sometimes it comes out, and sometimes it comes out in a nice, quiet conversation, you know, in the kitchen over coffee.
[time=2113] Sometimes it comes out while she's in the kitchen and you're in the recliner watching football, but nevertheless, oftentimes this complaint will come out and she will say that he isn't giving her any time.
[time=2126] She will talk about the lack of time that he's investing in her.
[time=2132] She'll talk about the lack of time that he's giving to her and the kids.
[time=2137] She'll wanna bring up this issue of time and how she feels like he's not using it wisely to which many a brilliant man in the room will respond by saying, what do you mean?
[time=2148] I don't give you my time.
[time=2150] I give you all my time.
[time=2154] All my time is yours, he says, as you choose on that sandwich.
[time=2159] All my time is yours.
[time=2162] I work all day.
[time=2163] Come on guys, you can repeat it with me.
[time=2165] I work all day long for you and the kids.
[time=2169] All my time is yours, which to the wife in that setting has a really empty feel to it.
[time=2175] It's got a very hollow ring.
[time=2178] If he's the kind of guy that never gives her any special time.
[time=2183] 'Cause is, I mean, is all of his time hers?
[time=2192] I mean, really it is.
[time=2194] All the time is hers, but it doesn't feel like it's worth anything if there's not in the midst of that a willingness to give her something special.
[time=2203] Giving her some evenings together, giving her some dates, just the two of them.
[time=2210] Does not deny that all his time is for her, it proves it.
[time=2215] One author said it this way.
[time=2219] This is why God declares one day in seven as especially God's.
[time=2224] All the days are his and making one special proves it.
[time=2228] And this is the way it is with our money and God.
[time=2231] Giving God a tenth of our income does not deny that all of our money is God's.
[time=2235] It proves that we believe it.
[time=2237] Tithing is like a constant offering of the first fruits of the whole thing.
[time=2243] The tenth is yours, oh Lord, in a special way.
[time=2247] In a special way because all of it's yours in an ordinary way.
[time=2254] John Piper said, I believe the tithes should be the first check we write after the income deposit is made in the bank.
[time=2261] And once you write it, you then put a seal.
[time=2265] I like the picture here.
[time=2266] You put a seal over what's left.
[time=2268] And on that seal, you write God's.
[time=2271] 'Cause we sometimes think of the tithe as God's and the rest as ours.
[time=2277] He says you put a seal on it and you put God's.
[time=2279] The tithe reminds us of that and proves that we really believe it.
[time=2283] Number three, tithing is an antidote to greed.
[time=2288] Write that down.
[time=2289] Tithing is an antidote to greed.
[time=2291] Giving away a tenth of our income to the mission and ministry of Christ can be an antidote to greed or better said maybe covetousness.
[time=2300] Covetousness, that's right.
[time=2302] The last of the Ten Commandments says, thou shalt not what?
[time=2306] Covet, Jesus said in Luke 12, 15.
[time=2309] Write that down, Luke 12, 15.
[time=2310] Jesus said, beware and be on your guard against every form of covetousness or greed.
[time=2318] And in Colossians 3.5, Paul says the same thing.
[time=2320] He calls covetousness idolatry.
[time=2323] Covetousness, wanting, listen, wanting things,
[time=2330] wanting stuff, wanting toys, wanting luxury,
[time=2337] wanting pleasure, wanting things too much.
[time=2342] Wanting things too much is incredibly dangerous
[time=2348] and destructive.
[time=2349] It diminishes the work of God in you.
[time=2352] It is completely against the character of God.
[time=2354] And listen to what Hebrews 13.5 says, Hebrews 13.5 says, let your character, that which defines you and your values and the principles you live by and the stuff that you believe in and stand for, let your character be free from the love of what?
[time=2370] Say it, money, be free from the love of money, being content, being content with what you have.
[time=2382] And I love how that continues on for he himself has said, I will never desert you nor will I ever forsake you.
[time=2391] You and I get to be content with what we have.
[time=2396] I love that word content, you might want to write this down.
[time=2400] I know it's pretty basic but I think it's pretty pertinent to the places that you and I sometimes live in and struggle in.
[time=2407] How can I best use what I've been given?
[time=2413] This is contentment.
[time=2414] How can I best use God?
[time=2417] What you've given me today as it stands, what you've allowed me to have, what you've allowed me to receive, how can I best use for you what I've been given?
[time=2428] Contentment is when your mind and heart are consumed with that kind of thinking instead of being consumed with the train of thought that goes something like this, how in the world can I figure out a way to get more?
[time=2442] Consumed with the idea of best using what I've been given
[time=2449] instead of being consumed with this idea of getting more, let your character be free from that.
[time=2456] Being content with what you have in you and I, Hebrews 13.5 says we can be content because he's got our needs covered.
[time=2464] He's never gonna forsake you.
[time=2465] Everything you need he'll provide and he's there to meet every single need.
[time=2471] Every time you give a tithe, every time you get, every time I'll say it, I'll say it this way, I'll make it personal.
[time=2479] 'Cause it's true.
[time=2482] Every time I give a tithe, I must deal with the desire for what I might have purchased instead.
[time=2493] This is getting down to the nitty gritty here.
[time=2496] Can I just say it to you honestly?
[time=2499] Let's just be, let's say it maybe more forthrightly.
[time=2503] To give is not to buy.
[time=2509] I'm gonna say it that way.
[time=2510] To give many, many times is not to purchase.
[time=2516] And that right there, my friends, that regular weekly, maybe hour by hour, tension, I think is absolutely, utterly important to maintain.
[time=2530] We must fight greed.
[time=2532] We must fight covetousness almost every single day of our lives, and God has appointed an antidote.
[time=2540] It's called giving.
[time=2541] He tests us again and again.
[time=2545] What do we desire most?
[time=2546] You might wanna write that down if you wanna just give it a shot here.
[time=2549] What do I desire most?
[time=2553] You might wanna write that on your sheet.
[time=2554] What do I desire most?
[time=2557] The advancement of his name, the support of his kingdom, the advancement of that cause or 10% more security, 10% more comfort, 10% more fun.
[time=2573] Now let's be real clear.
[time=2577] Is there anything wrong with security?
[time=2580] Yes or no?
[time=2581] Nope.
[time=2583] Is there anything wrong?
[time=2584] Is there anything inherently evil about comfort?
[time=2587] Nope.
[time=2588] Anything wrong with fun?
[time=2590] Oh gosh, I'm glad.
[time=2594] But when your death grip on fun and your death white knuckled grip on comfort and leisure, when your death grip, when your I'm not gonna go without mindset, when it comes to security, comfort and fun, when your grip on that keeps you from releasing those funds worshiply, when your desire to have begins to outweigh your willingness to give, then we've got trouble.
[time=2622] Then we've got trouble.
[time=2623] Jesus says, you know where your heart is by where you spend.
[time=2629] Said that in the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2630] You know where your heart is by where your treasure is.
[time=2633] Tithing can be one of God's great antidotes to greed.
[time=2639] Number four, open up to 2 Corinthians 9.
[time=2642] Would you go back to 2 Corinthians 9, verses six to eight.
[time=2647] Tithing number four is God's way of bringing about good deeds.
[time=2652] I love this.
[time=2653] Sometimes we miss this.
[time=2655] Tithing, giving is God's way of bringing about good deeds.
[time=2663] 2 Corinthians 9, 2 Corinthians 9, 6 to 8.
[time=2668] Let me read this to you.
[time=2672] 2 Corinthians 9, 6 to 8.
[time=2674] Now this I say here Paul addressing and teaching the church at Corinth on this issue of giving.
[time=2681] Now this I say he who sows or gives.
[time=2685] He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly.
[time=2689] The two who are equated and he who sows bountifully or aggressively or liberally or generously will also reap bountifully.
[time=2700] Each one, here comes the privatization of this thing between you and God.
[time=2704] Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion.
[time=2711] I shouldn't stand here and compel you to give.
[time=2714] I shouldn't stand here and manipulate you so that you feel kind of begrudged into giving out of guilt and shame.
[time=2723] No, it should come from your heart.
[time=2725] For God loves a cheerful, grateful giver.
[time=2728] And God is able, looking for a sate, to make all grace abound to you so that always having all sufficiency in everything you may have an abundance for every good what?
[time=2744] Say it out loud.
[time=2745] Deed, do you understand that?
[time=2747] He is going to, as you engage with him in this willing, cheerful effort to sow bountifully, he is going to provide you all that you need.
[time=2759] And in the provision of all that you need to give you the opportunity to see good deeds.
[time=2765] It's amazing.
[time=2766] The goal is good deeds.
[time=2770] The end product is good deeds.
[time=2772] Giving our resources brings about good deeds.
[time=2775] These are the things that make our light as we give.
[time=2779] These are the things that make our light shine and cause people to give glory to your Father in heaven.
[time=2785] When you're willing to give.
[time=2788] Yes, it's true that ministry and ministry staff get supported, that's true.
[time=2794] But don't forget when you give.
[time=2796] Don't forget, think, I mean, I was just thinking about it this week here.
[time=2799] I mean, don't forget that when you give here in this setting that God's allowed us to be a part of those gifts go to redirect and transform and change.
[time=2810] It's happening right now.
[time=2812] Those gifts go to redirect and transform and change the heart of a 15, 16, 17 year old today.
[time=2819] Here in this ministry, your gift allows for the homeless and the hurting and the grieving and the unemployed and the depressed and aging and lonely to be cared for by our care team and those that come alongside that team.
[time=2834] Your gifts support that kind of activity every day.
[time=2838] Your gift allows, your gift provides a building.
[time=2843] This building that we're in, the building adjacent to this, the buildings across the street.
[time=2849] Your tithe provides a building for almost 800 young disciples in training in a place called Black Hawk Christian School and Preschool.
[time=2859] Your gift is resourcing missionaries that we support, that we're in relationship with, that we love and walk alongside.
[time=2866] Your gift is resourcing missionaries to feed and clothe and care for the least of these all over the world.
[time=2873] Your gift is providing lights and heat in a classroom for hundreds of kids every Sunday morning on this campus.
[time=2880] Last Sunday and this Sunday and next Sunday, kids that are connected to families, many of whom are in need of the truth and the love and the transformation of the gospel.
[time=2890] Tithing is God's way of bringing about good deeds.
[time=2895] Listen, this is good.
[time=2896] If you lay up treasures in heaven, if you deposit in the kingdom, you get the privilege and the peace of knowing that's the kind of thing.
[time=2906] Those are the good deeds that come from that and those good deeds lead to spiritual eternal investments.
[time=2913] When you lay up treasures on earth, people have no reason to think your father in heaven is glorious, they only have reason to think that you are.
[time=2923] When you lay up treasures on earth, people have no reason to think your father in heaven is glorious, when you lay up treasures in heaven, the good deeds that come from that bring great glory and great honor and great renown to him.
[time=2939] Titus 2, 13, Christ died, it says, to purify for himself of people who are zealous for good deeds and when resources are given, good deeds are accomplished.
[time=2953] Number five, tithing is God's way, write it down, number five, tithing is God's way of providing for you.
[time=2960] Tithing is God's way of providing for you.
[time=2963] It's God's way of providing for you the tither, sufficient resources and money for your needs.
[time=2971] Watch this, we think, here's how I think and you probably think this way as well, we think clutching, we think hoarding, we think keeping is how we have what we need and yet in God's design, it's the absolute opposite.
[time=2986] Giving is the way of having what you need.
[time=2989] I know it doesn't make sense to the human mind but spiritually in terms of God's principles, that's how it works.
[time=2994] Giving is the way of having what you need.
[time=2997] Giving in a regular, disciplined, generous way up to and beyond the tithe is simply good sense in view of the promises of God.
[time=3007] Let me remind you this morning of one of those promises.
[time=3011] Giving in a regular, disciplined, generous way is good sense in view of the promises of God.
[time=3020] Malachi three, we looked at just one of those promises last week and here it is.
[time=3025] God said, bring the whole tithe.
[time=3028] I don't want you to miss that word whole.
[time=3030] Bring the whole tithe.
[time=3033] How many times have you and I brought half?
[time=3038] How many times have you and I realized at the end of the month because we didn't practice the first fruits principle that what we've got left over isn't the whole thing.
[time=3048] So that's why he says give it first.
[time=3050] That's why Piper said what he said in that quote, write the check first, put it aside first so that you can bring the whole tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house
[time=3065] and test me now in this he says, better word might be trust me because he says I know it's scary.
[time=3071] I know sometimes it doesn't make sense.
[time=3073] I know there are times where it seems confusing.
[time=3075] He says trust me, test me in this says the Lord of hosts.
[time=3078] If I will not open for you the windows as you give, as you tithe, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows.
[time=3090] It's really an amazing promise of God.
[time=3093] Test me, he says.
[time=3095] One old author said you think you can't afford to tithe.
[time=3100] Well, test him and what you will find when you test him is that you can't afford not to.
[time=3107] It's the safe way in a time in our culture today where people are talking about safety with our money.
[time=3116] This is a safe way of handling our resources.
[time=3119] Look at Luke 638, would you?
[time=3122] Luke 638, give, I love this.
[time=3125] Give and it will be given to you, good measure, pressed down.
[time=3130] Shaken together, as I read this, I'm sorry, let me just stop right here.
[time=3135] I can't help but think back to just a few weeks ago.
[time=3138] Our staff, our entire church staff, I mean, everybody that kind of works here took an entire morning.
[time=3146] I think it was about four hours.
[time=3148] And we loaded up into the activity buses and we went and raked leaves for senior adult families and individuals in our church family who needed some help raking leaves.
[time=3160] It was a kick.
[time=3162] We had a great, great time.
[time=3164] And it was just interesting thinking back on that experience, reading that passage because many of you have done this.
[time=3170] You have the big bag of the big bag and you're putting the leaves in the bag and you fill the bag up with leaves to the leaves right there at the top and is the bag full?
[time=3182] No, no, you get your little son or daughter or you get some smaller person to kind of, you know, jump in the bag and when they jump in the bag, all the leaves get squished down and then you pour more leaves in the bag and you pour more leaves into it, goes to the top and then you just keep pressing it down and you keep putting more in, right?
[time=3202] And this is the concept that Jesus gives us.
[time=3204] Give, offer your resources, give, and it will be given to you in good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over.
[time=3215] They will pour into your lap.
[time=3218] This is not a guarantee of getting rich.
[time=3224] It's a guarantee of you and I receiving an abundance for every good work and sufficient provision.
[time=3239] For every need we possess.
[time=3242] Well, we don't have time to get into all of the, the other side of this.
[time=3250] I tried to give you some reasons to tithe.
[time=3254] I'll give you the main headings here.
[time=3256] I'm gonna ask Val Waldoni if she'd come up at this time and I want you to just listen as I give you the three reasons not to tithe and we'll come back to this.
[time=3264] Here's three reasons not to tithe.
[time=3266] Three things to think about.
[time=3267] Tithing can become ritualistic.
[time=3270] We have to admit this.
[time=3274] Tithing can become ritualistic.
[time=3277] It can become routine instead of thoughtful.
[time=3282] It can become just the regular thing I do instead of the heartfelt act of worship it was intended to be.
[time=3288] Tithing can become ritualistic.
[time=3290] Tithing can become heartless.
[time=3292] What do I mean by heartless?
[time=3294] You know what?
[time=3295] There's some people in the room today, even still.
[time=3297] I know there was some last week 'cause I talked to 'em and there are some.
[time=3300] Anytime you bring this up and they miss it.
[time=3302] See, and what they wanna get to is this.
[time=3305] They'll say, Kelly, just give me a number.
[time=3308] Did you just quit all the talk about it and just give me a number?
[time=3311] I just want a number.
[time=3313] Just give me a percentage that you think I should land on and I'll land there and it'll all be great.
[time=3318] And I think sometimes what we're doing when we say that is we just wanna know how much we have to give so we know how much we have left over.
[time=3326] And see that completely misses the point because everything left over is who's, is God's.
[time=3335] Our focus can move to how much I give instead of how generous can I be?
[time=3343] Heartless.
[time=3345] Thirdly, I think you might wanna think about this.
[time=3348] Tithing can become simply and only about the money.
[time=3351] When in God's design, it should encompass the entire life.
[time=3359] A good friend of mine reminded me this week and I went back and listened to most of a message that he and I had both heard in recent years.
[time=3369] It was a message from Luke 19.
[time=3375] It was Luke 19, one to 10.
[time=3378] It was the story of Zacchaeus.
[time=3381] And you remember Zacchaeus, the wee little man who hit up in the Second Ward tree and Jesus came and saw him and took him to his house, remember?
[time=3388] And at the end of Luke 19, one to 10, I think it's in verse 10, it's a very interesting phrase where it says surely salvation has come to this man.
[time=3397] Does it say that?
[time=3398] No, it says surely salvation has come to this house.
[time=3403] And it was interesting to read about it again this week that a tax collector and Zacchaeus was a crook.
[time=3408] Zacchaeus was a swindler, Zacchaeus was a rotten little dude who took a lot of money from a lot of people and all that activity kind of came out of his home office, if you will.
[time=3420] That home had been used for evil, that home had been used for cheating and swindling.
[time=3426] And it's interesting that when Zacchaeus comes to faith and surely he did, Jesus says surely this salvation has come to this house which gets us thinking about what we do with not just a transformed heart, but now maybe even a transformed grill or not that the grill got saved, but are you with me?
[time=3449] A car and an extra room in the house.
[time=3453] And are you with me?
[time=3455] How we deal with and think about our stuff and what it's used for, a generous God, see at the end of the discussion folks, tithing, not to tithe, I'll tell you this, he longs for you and I to be a generous people who are generous with our first gift and generous with the rest of what's left over and all of it, all of it is to be given to see the kingdom furthered in his name glorified.
