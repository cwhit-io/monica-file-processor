[time=640] [MUSIC - 514 seconds]
[time=1176] A wonderful morning. I've heard my sermon now preach three times before this. So I'm grateful for that. I'm going to pray with you this morning, the lyrics to the hymn. It came upon the midnight clear. I'm going to pray them as our prayer to open the service. We sang them and the recent past. I'm going to read them with you as a prayer if you allow me to do that.
[time=1205] And we'll begin our service this morning, at least this part of our service this morning that way. So would you pray with me? Father, it came upon the midnight clear that glorious song of old from angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold. Peace on the earth. Good will to men from Heaven's all gracious king. The world in solemn stillness lay.
[time=1232] Father, to hear those angels sing. Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurled and still their heavenly music floats over all the weary world. Above its sat and lowly planes, Lord, they bend on hovering wing and ever over its babble sounds. Your blessed angels sing.
[time=1255] Father, we beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low, who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow.
[time=1267] Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing and arrest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing.
[time=1276] For lo the days are hastening on, friends, by prophets seen of old, when with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold, when the new Heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king and the whole world send back the song, which now the angels sing.
[time=1296] Father, may it be so. We pray with the Apostle John that your son, Jesus, would come quickly. We pray all these things in his name, with great thanksgiving. Amen.
[time=1307] We'll be in Luke chapter 2 this morning. I'll invite you there. Luke chapter 2, starting with verse 22. Much to Corbin's chagrin, we will not be starting with verse 21, which is about the circumcision of Jesus.
[time=1319] He suggested I talk about that for 40 minutes. I'm not going to.
[time=1323] His suggested title for the sermon was the incredible circumcision. I went with the another title, the marvelous presentation instead. So, sorry, Corbin about that.
[time=1335] Much has happened before we arrive at Luke chapter 2 and verse 22. So I'm going to walk you through just for a minute, or for a couple minutes, walk you through what has taken place in Luke's gospel up until verse 22 of chapter 2.
[time=1352] So if you want to go back to the first verse of Luke in your in your Bibles, I'm going to just kind of take a little journey and you can kind of flip the page with me.
[time=1361] We learned from the first four verses of Luke that Luke has written a well written, well investigated, careful, reliable account. He did his work. He did his homework. He did his research.
[time=1374] Then in Luke 1 verses 5 to 25, we meet two incredible people, Zechariah or Zechariah and Elizabeth, to elderly, righteous people. They receive wonderful news from the angel Gabriel about their son, whom Elizabeth will bear in her old age, and his name is going to be John.
[time=1395] In Luke 1 verses 26 to 38, the same angel Gabriel visits a virgin in Galilee, pledged to be married to a man named Joseph. The angel tells Mary that she's going to give birth to God's son.
[time=1412] He's going to have an everlasting kingdom.
[time=1417] In Luke 1, 3, 9, Mary then hurries to visit her relative Elizabeth, who, filled with the Holy Spirit, informs Mary that their unborn children already know each other.
[time=1429] Mary walks in the room and you remember, John in Elizabeth's womb jumps for joy.
[time=1436] The angel tells Zechariah and Elizabeth that John will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb.
[time=1445] I've been pondering that for years and it just gets more wonderful every year.
[time=1450] That provision that God made, John knew when Jesus was in the room. Hang on to that one for later.
[time=1459] Mary then bursts into a song of praise there with Elizabeth for God's mercy and faithfulness. Have you seen the film "The Nativity Story"?
[time=1470] Raise your hands, you've seen that film. Many of you have. I always recommend movies or books or music to you guys, so there's my most recent recommendation.
[time=1478] That's my favorite part of the movie.
[time=1481] When Mary and Elizabeth, they see each other and they rejoice. It's so beautiful the way it's done in that film. I recommend it to you highly.
[time=1490] She praises God for his mercy, for his faithfulness. He's brought down the proud. He gives grace to those who are humble.
[time=1499] People like Mary, servants, bond servants, she calls herself of the Father. Then Elizabeth in verses 7 through 66 gives birth to her son, John, a very special child who prepares the way for another.
[time=1514] My friend Steve Lombrake, who is the humanly speaking, the reason why I'm here in Fort Wayne with my family, used to always talk about John the Baptist as a person who was number two, I'm number two.
[time=1528] His whole life was about pointing to somebody else. His life was a directional finger pointed at the one coming after him. It's not me. He had the t-shirt on. I'm with him. John the Baptist.
[time=1541] Luke 1, 6, 7 through 80, John's father, Zacharias, filled with the Holy Spirit, we see a theme developing here.
[time=1549] Before singing, he breaks into a song about his son John and what his son John will do and who his son John will be pointing to.
[time=1558] He describes him in incredible ways that this son is going to help provide knowledge of salvation to the people of the Lord. He's going to talk about the sunrise from on high.
[time=1569] Luke 1, 79 is that word that word "dayspring" or "sunrise" or "dawn of the morning." That's how Zacharias describes Jesus.
[time=1580] It's worth making a big deal about Christmas for that one word because Zacharias frames all of history as though Jesus was the beginning of the morning. Everything before him was the nighttime. Everything after him is the day.
[time=1597] What a picture. And so we put trees in our living rooms. A weird thing to do.
[time=1603] I have to say, people come from other parts of the world and say, "What do you have a tree in your living room for?"
[time=1609] An evergreen tree speaks of this provision for salvation and everlasting life in the person of Jesus.
[time=1617] Hang on to that one too. Then in Luke 2, 1 through 7, extraordinary circumstances lead to a journey from Galilee to Bethlehem where the baby was to be born. Not by accident.
[time=1630] And then the passage right before ours is Luke 2, 8 through 21 where shepherds near Bethlehem hear the amazing news from an army of angels.
[time=1639] Probably not in Latin, but that's what the song says this morning. Gloria and excelsis deo. Glory to God in the highest. Then they go to see for themselves.
[time=1649] That brings us all to our passage. All that's happened before what we're about to read together.
[time=1655] Would you read with me this passage? We're going to read Luke 2, 22 through 33 will stop. In your notes you've got five points. I'll get to the first three, but not parts four and five.
[time=1666] They'll be online this week if you want to fill in those blanks. I know how you'll fill in blanks. I do too.
[time=1671] So go to the website this week and you'll find the information for points four and five that I won't get to this morning, but it will be there for you.
[time=1679] Luke 2, 22 through 33. And when the time came for their purification, according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.
[time=1688] As it is written in the law of the Lord, every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord and to offer a sacrifice according to the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.
[time=1700] There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and this man was righteous and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
[time=1712] It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.
[time=1719] And he came in the Spirit to the temple and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to what was said in the law, the custom of the law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, "Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all people,
[time=1747] a light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory and for glory to your people, Israel."
[time=1754] Some things I noticed as I worked with this passage and I'll share them with you in your notes.
[time=1758] The first point there in your notes for ends is that Jesus was presented by Mary and Joseph.
[time=1765] He was presented.
[time=1766] This word presented is a very important word.
[time=1771] He was presented, I'll get to that in point two actually, I'm going to hold that for just a moment.
[time=1776] Point A, he was raised by obedient people.
[time=1781] That's why Mary and Joseph were there.
[time=1783] They went to present him to the Lord.
[time=1786] I observe that Mary and Joseph cared what Leviticus 12 said.
[time=1793] If that's where that whole provision is, when babies are born, that's what you do.
[time=1797] You go in the first born son especially, there's purification to be done, there's offerings to be made and they cared about it.
[time=1805] The law is mentioned as your notes say there three times in those three verses and there's a bonus point in verse 27.
[time=1812] The law in verse 22, 23, 24 and 27.
[time=1818] It's all there.
[time=1819] It's all been provided and they are obedient to the law.
[time=1824] Something that had an influence on Jesus, I have a theological problem with that.
[time=1828] I think he had his act together before Mary and Joseph ever got along.
[time=1831] But that's not coincidence that he dropped into this family.
[time=1836] Mary and Joseph are certain kind of people.
[time=1840] Take note of that too.
[time=1841] There's a lot of that going on in this passage.
[time=1843] Mary and Joseph are faithful, obedient people.
[time=1848] They care about what God has said.
[time=1853] The focus though with the Old Testament law isn't so much on the obedience of Mary and Joseph as it is that God provided a way for all these things to work out.
[time=1863] When you have a baby, what do you do?
[time=1865] At some point in time when my first born son comes along, what do I do?
[time=1869] And the father has provided for all of it in his word.
[time=1872] Very particularly.
[time=1874] God says this is what happens, this is when, this is how, for this reason, all of those things.
[time=1880] God has provided a way for you and I to rightfully approach him in worship.
[time=1886] There's a way to do it.
[time=1888] And he's careful about it, and he's clear about it, and he's meaningfully expressed what all of those things mean and why they mean those things.
[time=1897] Now we no longer have to do that because of the blood of Jesus and aren't you grateful for that?
[time=1902] No more blood sacrifices to be offered.
[time=1905] They brought those animals into temple for a reason.
[time=1909] They didn't come back out again.
[time=1911] Hebrews 10 says, Hebrews 10 says, "By the blood of Christ, it's all taken care of." But we have to concern ourselves with Mary and Joseph about a sense of caution and sacredness as we approach God.
[time=1923] That's the takeaway from that whole thing.
[time=1925] The takeaway is that from Mary and Joseph's pattern, we observe that there's a way to carefully and sacredly approach God in worship.
[time=1934] We're not kind of strolling in, "Hey God, what's going on?" That posture isn't the way that we're supposed to approach him.
[time=1941] And Mary and Joseph's behavior, everything about it suggests that.
[time=1945] That God is a God who is mighty.
[time=1948] And the music we sang this morning does a very good job of communicating that to us.
[time=1953] Nothing is casual.
[time=1955] Childbirth, marriage, childbirth, parenting.
[time=1959] Nothing is kind of, "Well, we'll figure it out as we go." There's none of that.
[time=1963] God's involved every step of the way.
[time=1966] What do I do now?
[time=1967] He provides for it.
[time=1968] In a second act of purification, they go up to obedience to go up for their purification.
[time=1973] They offer a sacrifice.
[time=1975] Leviticus 12 says, "The sacrifice was for the atonement of the mother."
[time=1981] More on that in just a minute.
[time=1982] I'll come back to that.
[time=1984] The sacrifice in Leviticus 12, they were to bring to the temple, which was for the mother's atonement.
[time=1989] I think it's very meaningful.
[time=1991] Hang on to that thought.
[time=1992] Lots of thoughts to hang on to you.
[time=1993] Are you running out of hands to hang on to things?
[time=1997] But the kind of sacrifice is important, letter B. He was presented to the Lord.
[time=2003] And here I go.
[time=2004] I was getting excited before about the word present.
[time=2005] Now I'm going to go.
[time=2006] I'm going to go for it.
[time=2007] He was presented to the Lord.
[time=2009] In Acts 1, 3, it's the same word.
[time=2011] This word present is sort of like, "Here he is." It's an introduction kind of word.
[time=2017] Here they are.
[time=2018] He presented, Mary and Joseph did to the Lord Jesus.
[time=2024] Acts 1, 3 says this, "Of Jesus," remember that.
[time=2030] This is spoken in Acts 1, 3.
[time=2031] It happens to be Luke, which I think is very interesting, still, author of Acts as well.
[time=2036] He presented himself alive to them, to his disciples, after a suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during 40 days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
[time=2044] Now Colossians chapter 1, take a look at that.
[time=2048] Colossians chapter 1 verses 21 through 23, the same words being used here.
[time=2054] And you, we, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled
[time=2063] in his body of flesh by his death.
[time=2066] This is Jesus.
[time=2068] In order to present you, holy and blameless and above reproach before him, if indeed you
[time=2075] continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven.
[time=2085] Just as Jesus was presented, so he presents himself and now presents us to the Father.
[time=2093] Marvelous presentation of Jesus in the temple, then he presents himself alive, "Here I am,
[time=2100] friends, I'm here, I'm alive again." When you and I, it says in Corinthians that we're presented as a blameless bride before
[time=2109] the sun, to the bridegroom, what a beautiful picture of this presentation.
[time=2115] Here he is, Father, it's for you, wonderful.
[time=2121] Colossians 4, I'll take you there as well, this issue of presentation and the issue of the fullness of time.
[time=2128] And the fullness of time had come, Galatians 4, 4.
[time=2131] God sent forth his son, born of woman, under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive adoption as sons.
[time=2140] And because you are sons, God has sent his spirit of his son into your hearts, crying out of a father.
[time=2146] So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, an heir through God.
[time=2152] But all of that is possible because of Christmas.
[time=2160] All of that, sonship to God.
[time=2164] It is worth putting up lights and trees and making much of it.
[time=2170] This is the reason why I chose this passage to talk with you about.
[time=2174] These people make much, wait to hear what Simeon says, they make much of Jesus and it's right for you and I to make much of his birthday.
[time=2184] My in-laws and some friends of ours in Florida, they make birthday cakes for Jesus.
[time=2188] Do any of you guys do that?
[time=2190] That's a wonderful tradition.
[time=2192] It keeps the main thing, the main thing, which is a good thing.
[time=2197] Marilyn Chandler McIntyre on this issue, the fullness of time, said this in Christianity
[time=2203] today about eight years ago, she said this, that lovely phrase, fullness of time, suggests four things, the time crests like a wave, that there is a right moment for things to happen,
[time=2216] that it's not ours to plan that moment but to recognize it and we are not the primary agents of what happens in the world.
[time=2224] The fullness of time suggests all that, that there is an arc in history.
[time=2228] We need to know where we are on that arc and Simeon, Mary and Joseph, Zacharias and Elizabeth,
[time=2234] they all knew, where they were, they were aware of it for many, many reasons.
[time=2242] The third observation I think is perhaps the most powerful one for you and I.
[time=2248] I observed letter C that Jesus was raised by poor people and with that I take you back
[time=2254] to Leviticus chapter 12.
[time=2257] He was raised by poor people.
[time=2258] How would I know?
[time=2259] What does that passage suggest about that?
[time=2261] Well, let's look at Leviticus chapter 12 starting in verse six.
[time=2265] This is the reason why Mary and Joseph are even there in the first place.
[time=2269] When the days of your purifying are completed, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest, this is the mother, at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb, a year old for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a turtle dove for a sin offering.
[time=2283] There's a burnt offering and a sin offering, two sacrifices.
[time=2288] She shall offer it before the Lord, the priest will, and make atonement for her.
[time=2292] Interesting.
[time=2293] Then she shall be cleaned from the flow of her blood.
[time=2295] This is the law for her who bears a child, either male or female.
[time=2298] And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtle doves or two pigeons,
[time=2308] one for burnt offering, one for sin offering.
[time=2310] And the priest will make atonement for her and she'll be clean.
[time=2316] Two things to say as we pause here for a moment.
[time=2318] Mary and Joseph couldn't afford a lamb, it's why there's two little birds and no lamb.
[time=2324] But perhaps Mary and Joseph brought the lamb with them to the temple.
[time=2330] That thought occurred to me this week.
[time=2333] Why no lamb?
[time=2334] The atonement that would be made for all of us was in Mary and Joseph's arms, probably
[time=2340] on a sling over Mary's shoulder.
[time=2346] Jesus condescended to live among these kinds of people, poor peasant people.
[time=2352] Mary and Joseph are from a place called Nazareth.
[time=2356] Do you know what Nathaniel said about Nazareth?
[time=2359] Remember that story?
[time=2360] Can anything good come out of Nazareth?
[time=2363] It's a nowhere place in the wilderness, Nazareth.
[time=2368] And Mary and Joseph are not wealthy people, carpentry was not an affluent profession.
[time=2376] These are the kind of people that God gives his son to raise.
[time=2381] If a prominent person, friends, came to our church, needed a place to stay, where we put them up?
[time=2390] With which one of our church families would we house them?
[time=2396] God sent his son into the world and allowed him to be raised by poor people, peasant people,
[time=2404] living in a nowhere place.
[time=2407] We have a lot to learn about the economy of God and the kind of people that God steams.
[time=2414] God is steams the elderly, Zacharias, Elizabeth, Simeon, and Anna, who we won't talk about
[time=2421] this morning, are all elderly people and God is steams them.
[time=2425] God holds them in high regard.
[time=2428] God appears to shepherds.
[time=2430] Shepherding was also not a prominent profession.
[time=2434] He appears to them, with his angels and the Mary and Joseph, peasant people.
[time=2440] We have it very backwards, I'm afraid.
[time=2443] All that for Mary and Joseph's presentation of Jesus.
[time=2447] The second point to make you see this morning as we move through the passage is the piece of Simeon.
[time=2452] I love how it begins in verse 25.
[time=2456] There was a man in Jerusalem who just happened to be there, whose name was Simeon.
[time=2461] This man was righteous and devout.
[time=2464] Simeon is a remarkable man.
[time=2466] I told you my friend Steve Longbrake is the humanly speaking, the reason why my family is here in Fort Wayne.
[time=2472] He's going to read with us this morning for you a poem about Simeon written from the perspective
[time=2480] of Simeon's grandson to Simeon's great-grandchildren.
[time=2484] Listen, as he reads.
[time=2489] At dawn, the old man knelt where he had prayed for years and now could see the rich and poor
[time=2495] drawn near to give some sacrifice that they might live.
[time=2501] He looked at every worshipper and waited for his heart to stir.
[time=2505] When the Messiah came to pray, he thought it will be a plane as day when he walks through
[time=2511] the Temple Gate.
[time=2513] Did Simeon know?
[time=2515] It is a human trait to show that we expect to find the best attended well and finally
[time=2522] dressed.
[time=2525] And even Simeon was stunned that God with all his strength had shunned the way of wealth
[time=2532] when God revealed it is the yonder child concealed.
[time=2539] Within the Temple, simple, woolen shawl, could Simeon believe that all God ever promised
[time=2548] lay asleep like treasure bundled in a cheap and tattered sling?
[time=2556] Think on it now.
[time=2559] Would you believe that God somehow became a child?
[time=2563] He did believe and lay the baby on his sleeve and trembling let the spirit fill his mouth.
[time=2571] Now by thy sovereign will, O God of grace let me depart and see more fully what thou
[time=2578] art in heaven with my precious wife and thee in everlasting life.
[time=2586] For all thy word to me is done.
[time=2590] With love, O Simeon, lean down and I have seen the promised one, the great salvation
[time=2597] thou hast made for every people, every trait, a light to guide the nations well and glory
[time=2605] to for Israel.
[time=2608] And now my children tell me this.
[time=2611] Do you believe that Jesus is the fairest, brightest, strongest light that ever was or
[time=2621] is tonight?
[time=2623] If so, then light this candle three and sing a song of hope with me.
[time=2635] Every candle is burning in the Advent season, John Piper wrote that poem, you can find
[time=2642] it in his completion on his website.
[time=2644] The poem goes on to describe that that night Simeon was found by his son with his finger
[time=2651] on the line that says that a light will shine among you, probably from Isaiah 60.
[time=2656] Wonderful stuff.
[time=2659] In his righteous and devout, it says, the next point in your outline, letter A, as we move
[time=2667] forward here, Simeon was an extraordinary man, extraordinary man, righteous and devout.
[time=2674] The word for righteous there is somebody that has an a blameless record of moral integrity.
[time=2680] In Luke 1, 6, Zacharias and Elizabeth are described exactly the same way.
[time=2686] Ancient authors use that word or those words, righteous and devout.
[time=2689] The word for devout is a word that means Godfearing.
[time=2692] And I've never found those two words used together of any other person besides Simeon.
[time=2696] It's a remarkable statement about who he is.
[time=2700] But ancient authors use the same word for righteous to describe Job and Abraham, no small figures in Israelite history, big heavy hitters, Job and Abraham.
[time=2712] Notice friends that his righteous behavior informed the kind of things he was looking forward to.
[time=2719] He's righteous and devout and he was looking for something.
[time=2722] He was waiting for the consolation of Israel.
[time=2728] The fact that he was righteous and devout led to the things that he was looking for.
[time=2732] It was all set in motion.
[time=2733] It was all sustained.
[time=2734] It would all be brought to light by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2737] The Holy Spirit is all over this passage.
[time=2743] Everywhere we go around Jesus in these first two chapters, we see extraordinary people.
[time=2746] More to listen to them for you more than once.
[time=2748] I won't do it again.
[time=2749] But this is the takeaway.
[time=2750] This is the observation I'll make with you this morning.
[time=2753] You can tell a lot about a person by the kind of people who are drawn to them.
[time=2759] That'd be a good thing for you to maybe to jot down, I'll repeat it for you.
[time=2764] You can tell a lot about a person by the kind of people that are attracted to them.
[time=2771] What kind of people were attracted to Jesus, peasants, elderly, righteous people, shepherds?
[time=2784] I observed that with you.
[time=2786] Letter B is an observation that we've already made that I'll make it with you again.
[time=2790] The Simeon was led under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2795] The Spirit occurs three times, like the word law appears, three times, verses 23 and 24.
[time=2801] Now the Spirit shows up three times in that passage, verses 25, 26 and 27.
[time=2812] It's interesting.
[time=2814] There's nothing in the passage that explicitly tells us how Simeon knew that it was Jesus,
[time=2820] that it was salvation.
[time=2826] But the Holy Spirit led him there, informed everything he understood and knew, and the Holy Spirit revealed to him, "Simeon, that baby you're holding is in the saia."
[time=2839] You're not going to die Simeon until you see the Lord's Christ, but it revealed to him that it would not happen, and he's holding God's provision for salvation, as John Piper
[time=2848] suggests in a sling, in a little woolen shawl.
[time=2853] Maybe he thought there'd be an army marching in with trumpets and pomp and circumstance,
[time=2859] but no, it comes in over a shoulder and a little baby, God's provision for salvation
[time=2868] and a baby.
[time=2870] The Holy Spirit revealed all these things to him.
[time=2873] See, let her see there before you, friends, I observe that Simeon was an expectant man.
[time=2879] That great theologian, Tom Petty, said, "The waiting is the hardest part."
[time=2889] And in that way, he was correct.
[time=2891] We had a Christmas morning yesterday at the Webster House for this reason.
[time=2894] We're leaving on Thursday, Jody and the kids are leaving Thursday to go to Florida to be with my folks.
[time=2899] I'm leaving Saturday once exams are done, you guys can look forward to that.
[time=2905] So we'll have Christmas with my parents in Florida, but our Christmas morning was only shot at it yesterday, and Saturday morning Hannah, a daughter Hannah, she's five.
[time=2914] I turn over in bed and she's there at my face at 705, "Daddy, it's morning time." She's one little ray of light for the shades, the window, and then she goes to her brother's room and puts her ear against the door and says, "I think he's awake.
[time=2927] I think he's awake so they can all go downstairs and open their few presents and expect and see." Isn't that a great thing about kids at Christmas?
[time=2935] You just can't wait to go downstairs and to go wherever the presents are kept.
[time=2939] It's a beautiful thing.
[time=2942] It's right to look forward to those great gifts and Simeon was looking forward to the greatest gift that's ever been given.
[time=2949] I won't get to this point, but 2 Corinthians 9 and 15, can I give you that little bonus coverage point?
[time=2954] Number five, letter B, second point there, 2 Corinthians 9, 15, and that blank right this down.
[time=2960] Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift.
[time=2964] It's an appropriate thing to say right now, I'll say it again, please write it in.
[time=2969] Thanks be to God for his indescribable, his inexpressible gift.
[time=2975] Simeon was holding it in his arms, he was holding him in his arms, Isaiah 25.
[time=2987] By the way, the new living translation translates the word consolation as rescue.
[time=2993] He was waiting for the rescue of Israel, the rescuer of Israel.
[time=2999] The word for consolation is a fascinating word.
[time=3001] That means to console or consolar, and the rabbis would call the Messiah the consolar
[time=3009] of Israel.
[time=3011] And there he was.
[time=3012] I love that verse, it took him up in his arms, it's verse 28, isn't it?
[time=3018] So tender.
[time=3019] Simeon takes him up in his arms, it's a very tender, very beautiful picture.
[time=3024] But Isaiah 25 first, Simeon knew God's word, more time, more on that in a moment as we
[time=3034] move through the third point, lots of things that Simeon knew, that he was now experiencing.
[time=3043] He will swallow up death forever, Isaiah 25 verse 8, and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people, he will take away from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken.
[time=3054] It will be said on that day, behold, this is our God, we've waited for him, that he
[time=3060] might save us.
[time=3062] This is the Lord, this is the Lord, we've waited for him, let us be glad and rejoicing
[time=3068] his salvation.
[time=3069] How ironic that a baby would be all those things, that Simeon knew it, he knew it.
[time=3077] Now Isaiah 25, 8 is one of those already not yet promises.
[time=3081] He hasn't swallowed up death forever, yet, he will someday.
[time=3086] We look forward, we expect, we long for that day, just like Simeon did, we're in the second
[time=3092] side of it, he was looking for the first coming, we're looking for the second one.
[time=3096] My encouragement to you in the meantime is to be like Simeon, be like Simeon, that's another
[time=3102] great takeaway from this passage, be like him, expect the right things, concern yourself with the righteous and devout life that you might look for what God has for you, for me, for us.
[time=3114] He didn't miss it.
[time=3116] How many in that day missed it?
[time=3118] They missed the baby Jesus, many, tragically too many, and how many still miss him.
[time=3123] Did you hear those readings that the kids did this morning?
[time=3127] Shine your light, shine the light before your friends and neighbors and coworkers.
[time=3134] We could all take that advice.
[time=3136] In conclusion this morning, Simeon breaks in the song.
[time=3140] The third point is the Psalm of Simeon.
[time=3145] He can't help all these songs in the first two chapters of Luke.
[time=3150] Mary starts singing and Zachariah starts singing and now Simeon starts singing, beautiful stuff.
[time=3157] What you would expect when the Holy One has come forth, when the long expected Jesus arrives,
[time=3164] God has set his people free.
[time=3168] Simeon rejoices in what God has done.
[time=3175] Look at that passage with me again.
[time=3176] Look at verse 29, "Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace."
[time=3183] The word for depart there is kind of like the word dismiss.
[time=3186] Now I can go.
[time=3187] God has let Simeon go.
[time=3190] Now you can go Simeon, it's okay.
[time=3194] According to your word, according to your word, for my eyes, watch friends, my eyes have seen your salvation, verse 31, that you have prepared in the presence of all people.
[time=3205] This is all God's idea.
[time=3208] A light for revelation of the Gentiles and for glory to your people, Israel.
[time=3214] God revealed the Simeon by the Holy Spirit that he would allow him to live until he saw the Messiah, and now he holds God's idea of the way the salvation would unfold.
[time=3224] I would invite you to picture Simeon as the frame does here, singing over the baby Jesus.
[time=3231] And I envision this tears streaming down his face into his gray beard as he holds the one
[time=3240] who would be the consolation of Israel.
[time=3243] Simeon, let her be friends, has seen God's provision for salvation.
[time=3251] I take it to Isaiah 52, Simeon knew all these verses, and it just overflows in praise.
[time=3259] As he sees God's promises unfold, Isaiah 52-7, how beautiful upon the mountains of the feet
[time=3265] of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation, who says to Simeon, "Your God reigns, the voice of your watch
[time=3276] when they look at their voice, they sing for joy, for eye to eye they see the return
[time=3282] of Yahweh to Simeon." Break forth in the singing, break forth in the singing, lots of singing in the first
[time=3291] chapters of Luke.
[time=3293] You waste places of Jerusalem, for the Lord has comforted his people, consolation, comfort.
[time=3299] It's right there.
[time=3300] He has redeemed Jerusalem.
[time=3302] The Lord has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends
[time=3308] of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
[time=3312] Just as the prophet Isaiah, the prophet Simeon, breaks in the song, as the long, expected promise is held in his arms.
[time=3320] Psalm 98, Psalm 98, Simeon knew all these promises.
[time=3327] Sing to the Lord a new song.
[time=3328] He's done marvelous things.
[time=3329] His right hand and holy arm have worked salvation for him.
[time=3334] The Lord has made known his salvation.
[time=3336] He's revealed his righteousness inside of all the nations.
[time=3339] He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel.
[time=3344] All the ends of the earth have seen, my eyes have seen your salvation.
[time=3350] All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
[time=3357] Lastly, friends, let her see, Jesus is the light of revelation and glory, all this in
[time=3370] a baby.
[time=3371] I didn't plan for Isaiah 60 to be our reading this morning.
[time=3374] I didn't plan that, but God is good, one spirit, one faith.
[time=3381] I didn't plan on come thou, I'm not expected Jesus to be sung, but there it was.
[time=3388] God is good.
[time=3390] Isaiah 9, we sang these words earlier, and I'll read them with you as we close this morning, as we approach our closing.
[time=3397] Isaiah 9, "The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
[time=3405] Those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness on them has light shined."
[time=3411] We go down to verse 6, "To us a child is born, to us a son is given.
[time=3418] The government will be upon a shoulder.
[time=3419] His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." I end my time with you this year, the way I began it.
[time=3431] Back in January, I talk with you about Isaiah 42 and the delightful God who delights and his servant.
[time=3437] Where have you here for that?
[time=3439] Remember that?
[time=3440] My first time with you, I believe, and I'll bookend the year with Isaiah 42, starting
[time=3447] in verse 5, "Thus says God, the Lord, who created the heavens and stretched them out,
[time=3455] who spread out the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk in it.
[time=3462] I and the Lord, I have called you in righteousness.
[time=3465] I will take you by the hand and keep you.
[time=3467] I will give you, as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations." This is a person he's talking about.
[time=3474] The you of verse 6 is identified in verse 1 as God's servant.
[time=3479] So I end the year, the way I began with you.
