[time=170] - You know, Jesus likened the kingdom of heaven to a celebration, a celebration of the king and his son's wedding.
[time=180] In that parable, he said the kingdom of heaven is like a wedding banquet where the king is God, the son is Christ, and the bride are those who RSVP yes to heaven's invitation.
[time=196] The kingdom of heaven, God's divine, rain, rule and order and the hearts and lives of people on this earth now and in the future.
[time=205] It's designed to be a celebration that changes your life when you RSVP yes.
[time=211] You know, it can be argued that Jesus and his earthly ministry merely communicated the kingdom of heaven, merely communicated the invitation to this celebration.
[time=223] In fact, he's watching in the temple as people are giving out of their abundance.
[time=229] They're giving large bags of coins and they're throwing it in the trumpet shaped containers where offerings would go in the temple and it's making a loud noise.
[time=237] Gage, gage is each bag kind of ricochets inside that trumpet shaped container.
[time=243] But then something really unique happens and it's a picture of RSVPing yes to the invitation from heaven.
[time=252] A widow walks in and all she has are these two coins.
[time=258] A total, the value of less than a penny and a different noise happens.
[time=264] We hear, think, think, think, think.
[time=267] And Jesus says, you know what?
[time=271] She gave the most.
[time=272] She gave what she was afraid to lose.
[time=275] She gave all she had.
[time=278] You know, there's something about RSVPing yes
[time=284] to the kingdom of heaven.
[time=286] It comes with a response that we're ready to give all we have.
[time=289] So come and join us on a journey in the dump in the Philippines where the kingdom of heaven is breaking loose in a celebration.
[time=297] - We had a girl named Hazel
[time=313] and we were walking our first day here.
[time=315] They took us like to all the houses to kind of see where everyone lived and everything.
[time=319] Hazel kind of was walking with me and you know, it didn't really say much but you could just sense kind of the presence of the Lord was with us as we were going into these places.
[time=329] And at the end of the day, you know, I was talking with the pastors asking, you know, does she go to school or kind of how does that work?
[time=335] And they were saying that she wasn't going to school at the time but she was praying for the last couple of months that God would allow her an open door to go to school.
[time=344] And so, you know, I asked the pastor how that would work and we started talking through some of the options and we ended up sponsoring her.
[time=352] It's been amazing to see just the transformation, you know, and it was interesting where I thought, here's a young girl that's just praying with enough faith to believe that God's going to answer her prayer and to think that simple, active obedience years later has now given her, you know, hope for the future.
[time=372] And the last time I was here, we went into their house and there's pictures of Sonja and I and of the dogs and it just brought home to me.
[time=380] This really is an address that is close to my heart, you know, because it's more than just trying to help people.
[time=387] It's about building relationships and building family and I really believe it.
[time=391] What's interesting to me is that the God of the universe who prompted her to pray, prompted Hazel to pray, also prompted you and she didn't have to ask you.
[time=401] - Yeah, that's powerful.
[time=403] - What I'm learning more and more as I study the Bible
[time=409] and as I live life is the kingdom of heaven, the invitation to the kingdom of heaven comes everywhere.
[time=419] For anyone you can find from the White House to a shanty here in the dump, the kingdom of heaven can break through any heart, anywhere, any place, at any time.
[time=435] - This is Wilson Aling.
[time=438] He's one of our members and he came to know the Lord a couple of years back and he's been changed
[time=449] from a life of just alcoholism and lostness and he's one of the tough guys around here.
[time=460] But the Lord came into his life and softened him up and now he's leading a care group in his area, and he's teaching children before he came to know the Lord, he didn't fear God, he didn't fear anyone.
[time=472] But as he gave his life to Jesus, because of the love of God, now he knows that it's Jesus who gives him strength and every day he's able to keep on, even if it's tough, it's grinding poverty.
[time=487] He just came from the trash heap there, that's where he makes a living scavenging, but he knows that the Lord is strengthening him and now he's able to share the love of God.
[time=500] - When we RSVP know to heaven's invitation,
[time=506] it flows from a proud heart, a hard heart.
[time=509] One that says no, because it's gonna cost one of my three resources of life, my time, my talent, my treasures, but you see that actually flows from the heart.
[time=521] Just like the human heart has four chambers, the spiritual heart has four chambers.
[time=525] The mind, the will, the emotions, and the spirit.
[time=530] What our mind is our thoughts, our will is our choices, our emotions are our feelings, and our spirit includes our prayers or even lack of them.
[time=539] I really think there are two styles of heartening our heart toward God, of saying no to heaven's invitation.
[time=546] The first one is stone, the second one is sand.
[time=550] Stone is a hard heart, it's legalistic.
[time=553] It says that if I obey, I can actually manipulate the deity of the universe.
[time=558] If I just do this, he will do that.
[time=561] And you know, stone takes a severe tool to be shaped.
[time=565] It's kind of like the older brother and the parable of the prodigal son.
[time=568] The second kind of hard heart is sand.
[time=572] It's loose, it's licentious.
[time=575] It takes a storm to be shaped, and it's like the prodigal in the parable of the prodigal son.
[time=581] The irony of it is both sand and stone are the same exact substance.
[time=586] They both come from the ground.
[time=588] And that leads us to what God desires for our lives.
[time=592] And that is a heart of clay.
[time=593] One that's malleable in the hands of the potter.
[time=597] Humility RSVPs, yes, to heaven's invitation.
[time=602] How have you RSVP'd to heaven's invitation?
[time=605] It's an external sign of an internal condition.
[time=608] - This place we're at now is greasy in Diana's house.
[time=615] And I first met them a couple of years back.
[time=618] And they were singing as part of a little worship team they put together out here.
[time=623] And they started sharing me a little bit about their story with their parents.
[time=627] And what I thought was amazing about it was the pastors here were telling me that the father had actually taken out a loan to build a home for his family.
[time=639] And took a loan out and they ended up building a cinder block, kind of like a one room place.
[time=645] And it was awesome to see that even in the midst of where we're at, that there's that work ethic and just that desire to make the best for your family, you know?
[time=655] Last couple of years we've sponsored both of them in the school.
[time=658] And that's where we were earlier today over at Capitol Hills in the beautiful place.
[time=661] It's awesome to see kind of the progress for them so far.
[time=666] And I just pray that God blesses the house that they have and continues just to instill his love in them.
[time=674] So here it is.
[time=675] - Jesus lived 90% of his earthly life in Nazareth.
[time=681] Nazareth said on about nine acres, the floors in each house were dirt.
[time=687] The mortar used to put the stone together was done.
[time=691] The sewage ran open in the streets.
[time=696] Archaeological excavations show us that probably there was only one set of clothing for each person in the house.
[time=703] There was a low iron count and iron deficiency in most people.
[time=708] And you know, it's not unlike here.
[time=711] I think if Jesus were to come to this earth now,
[time=717] he might come right here.
[time=718] - This is Susana Roado.
[time=721] The father deserted the family.
[time=727] Baby Pa, when she was a baby
[time=735] and she hasn't seen the father since.
[time=738] And so they're on their own.
[time=741] Her mother works as a scavenger in the mountain of trash behind us and feeds and supports.
[time=752] (speaking in foreign language) Three children.
[time=758] These are the kind of situations that exist in these areas.
[time=762] With children like Susana, you can see the potential that's there.
[time=769] It's dreaming of being able to study in a private school and by God's grace.
[time=779] This August, she gave her life to Jesus, his Lord and Savior.
[time=784] He's coming to know the Lord.
[time=786] - Yes.
[time=787] - There's hope in her.
[time=788] As we are able to help.
[time=791] She's thanking you for visiting us here,
[time=798] visiting Ben's special.
[time=799] - My pleasure.
[time=800] (laughing) - You know, the Gospel of Matthew says that Jesus saw the crowds.
[time=809] He saw them as helpless as sheep without a shepherd and it says he had compassion on them.
[time=815] Compassion means literally to suffer together.
[time=821] Jesus' heart broke when he saw the masses.
[time=825] And you know, here in the city of veterans, there are 80,000 people who live in the dump.
[time=831] About two thirds of those are children, they're kids.
[time=835] And I gotta tell you, with Derek bringing me here, my heart is broken.
[time=843] I feel like I'm suffering together with them and I wanna do something to help.
[time=849] And I gotta tell you, at the end of the day, I'm the one who's heart is blessed.
[time=854] I'm the one whose heart grows because there's something about that it is more blessed to give than to receive.
[time=864] You know, and it's just a powerful, powerful event
[time=871] to invest in a life like this.
[time=875] (gentle music) (speaking in foreign language)
[time=887] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=977] (gentle music) - So I encourage you, wherever you are,
[time=997] whatever you have going on, would you see those around you with compassion?
[time=1003] Would your heart break a little bit?
[time=1006] And would you maybe suffer with them by just giving your heart and a little bit of those three resources of life, your time, your talent, and your treasures?
[time=1016] You'll be blessed.
[time=1017] (gentle music)
[time=1066] (audience cheering)
[time=1096] (gentle music) - Well, basically what happened there
[time=1106] was an invitation to live for an audience of one, an invitation to live for an audience of one.
[time=1117] Have you ever thought about what it would look like if we lived for an audience of one, using an image that's familiar to you, let's just check this out on the screen.
[time=1129] Have you ever thought about living life that way?
[time=1146] That God was just watching everything on the inside
[time=1153] and everything on the outside.
[time=1156] And if so, if you would do that, would anything change?
[time=1161] You know, the last home game was played at Texas Stadium where the Dallas Cowboys play this week.
[time=1167] And you know the unique architecture of that facility, does anybody know what was really unique about it?
[time=1173] In the top of the roof, what was the case?
[time=1176] Big hole in the roof.
[time=1178] And there was a text in tradition that there was a reason for that.
[time=1180] It was so that God could watch the game.
[time=1184] In essence, they would play for an audience of one.
[time=1190] What we're thinking about today is this invitation to live for an audience of one.
[time=1197] See, we all do it.
[time=1198] We all live for an audience of one.
[time=1201] Typically, it's just the wrong one.
[time=1202] It's either our selfishness, ourselves, or it's unhealthy for another.
[time=1209] But what would it look like if we lived for an audience of one?
[time=1214] I try to read through a different translation of the Bible from cover to cover every year.
[time=1220] And as I would read through the life of David, I began to kind of take mental note of what I was seeing about this guy who seemed to live for an audience of one.
[time=1232] And this message has grown from those years of making those mental notes and it finally has all come together.
[time=1239] Now this would be a great Sunday to take notes 'cause it's gonna be a little deep and heavy for the last Sunday of the year during the holidays.
[time=1247] But I really encourage you to do it because this has impacted me tremendously.
[time=1250] I would hope it would just impact you as well.
[time=1252] What would it look like if we lived for an audience of one, living for an audience of one, and we're gonna look at the life of David?
[time=1259] Five things.
[time=1259] The first one is he surrendered for an audience of one.
[time=1264] David surrendered for an audience of one.
[time=1266] First Samuel, 13, 14.
[time=1269] Samuel comes to King Saul and breaks the news to him that his kingdom's not gonna last.
[time=1274] But now your kingdom will not endure.
[time=1277] The Lord has sought out a man after his own heart, a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people because you have not kept the Lord's command.
[time=1289] Now what was unique about this man after God's own heart who surrendered his heart to God, to be like his, is that he wrote Psalms.
[time=1299] And so as I went through these ideas and the Psalms that David wrote, I would find where David kind of would explain these things that I would see in the Chronicles of his life.
[time=1310] So Psalm 37.4, one of my favorite verses in the Bible says this, delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.
[time=1320] Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.
[time=1326] I was in a Bible study several years ago with your daughter and she asked me this question.
[time=1331] What do you think that means?
[time=1333] I said, what do you mean, what does it mean?
[time=1336] Can you hear her asking that?
[time=1337] I said, well, what do you mean?
[time=1338] She said, well, give you the desires of your heart.
[time=1342] Does that mean he's gonna tell you what they are?
[time=1344] Or does that mean he's gonna create those?
[time=1348] I said, oh, that's deep.
[time=1350] I'll try to figure that out next week and I'll let you know.
[time=1353] So here's what I found.
[time=1355] Delight, a nog in Hebrew, is a surrendered clay heart.
[time=1360] It means literally to be pliable or humble.
[time=1363] It's surrender says to the potter, I can't, you can.
[time=1368] I can't, you can't.
[time=1370] And the heart is the entire inner being.
[time=1373] You heard me talk about on the DVD and I developed an acronym for you to remember the four chambers of the spiritual heart, just like we have four chambers of the physical heart, is the will, the intellect, the spirit, and the emotion.
[time=1386] So it's the acronym wise.
[time=1389] The W is will, that's our chamber of our choices.
[time=1394] The intellect or our mind, the chamber of our thoughts, the spirit, the lead chamber of our prayers and the emotions which represent our feelings.
[time=1403] So when we delight ourselves in the Lord, we make our hearts parable and we choose his heart, we meditate on his heart, we pray for his heart and we want his heart.
[time=1418] Let me say that again.
[time=1419] We choose, meditate, pray, and want his heart.
[time=1424] Now, is there anyone here named Nathan?
[time=1426] Anybody?
[time=1428] Do you have any Nathan's, some Nathan's?
[time=1431] Nathan, is Hebrew for give?
[time=1434] That's the word used in the verse here in Psalm 37.4.
[time=1437] Give means actually to orchestrate.
[time=1441] So here's the answer to your question.
[time=1443] See, these desires are the heartbeat that connect our hearts with our ways, our time, talent, treasures, our three resources of life.
[time=1449] And our desires are to be satisfied only in him.
[time=1453] This is how we would know God's will for our lives.
[time=1456] When we delight ourselves in the Lord, when we surrender for an audience of one, he shapes our desires, he orchestrates in our desires to be like his.
[time=1466] And this is how we know God's will for our lives.
[time=1468] Our hearts and our desires are shaped like his.
[time=1471] And like I said in our prayer, each one of us has a unique expression of the kingdom of heaven in us, unique expression of the same Christ in us.
[time=1481] And this is how we know what that is for our lives is we delight ourselves in the Lord.
[time=1487] Look how David wrote it in Psalm 86 verses 11 and 12.
[time=1492] He said, teach me your way, O Lord, and I will walk in your truth.
[time=1495] Give me an undivided heart, a fully-stranded heart, then I may fear your name.
[time=1501] That's a fatherly fear.
[time=1503] It's a healthy fear, it's a reverence.
[time=1505] Next verse, I will praise you, O Lord, my God, with all my heart, not some, all four chambers.
[time=1514] I will glorify, I will reveal your character in presence, your name, your identity, who you are forever.
[time=1520] That's what David wrote.
[time=1522] Now David, I want you to write this down, kind of describe this fully-surrendered heart, this surrendered for an audience of one, as a process that included two elements.
[time=1533] I want you to write them down, examine and surrender.
[time=1536] We would ask the Spirit of God to examine and help us surrender, examine our hearts and help us surrender any offensive way.
[time=1543] So it's very a familiar passage to man.
[time=1545] You saw him 139, verses 23 and 24 penned by David.
[time=1550] Search me, O God, and know, experience my heart.
[time=1554] Test me and know my anxious thoughts.
[time=1556] Anxious would be a divided mind, remember you just prayed for an undivided heart.
[time=1560] Anxious thoughts would be divided, one foot in with God, one foot out.
[time=1563] If there's anything like that, God, see if there's any offensive way in me like that, and then help me surrender it.
[time=1569] Lead me in the way of everlasting.
[time=1571] David's refining prayer of examine and surrender.
[time=1579] An example of what that would be.
[time=1581] It's interesting that he wrote this, Psalm 62, 10, it's the second part of the verse.
[time=1585] He said, "Do your riches increase?
[time=1588] Do not set your heart on them 'cause you're gonna be tempted to trust in your giftedness over your godliness." You're gonna be tempted to trust in your giftedness over your godliness.
[time=1601] Remember that money is pride's measurement of our giftedness.
[time=1605] Wisdom is humility's measurement of our godliness.
[time=1610] God changed this particular desire in my life
[time=1616] about 17 years ago and began to transform not only my heart and my desires and my life, but mainly my business.
[time=1625] And to be able to experience a radical new way to do life that included examine and surrender, to be surrendered for an audience of one.
[time=1635] And so I grew with this passion for the lost, but it was coming here and you know who you are.
[time=1642] A couple people here who really influenced my life to have a passion for the least because that was the heart of Christ.
[time=1650] And so where the lost and the least would come together to place like Manila, that really started to get my attention to cross the international date line and to do something like this.
[time=1660] And I know it pales in comparison to what many of you have done with your lives.
[time=1665] But I use it today just as a teaching tool on being surrendered for an audience of one.
[time=1671] What would happen today if you fully surrendered your heart and your desires for an audience of one?
[time=1678] What would happen?
[time=1681] Would you consider today memorizing David's refining prayer?
[time=1685] Psalm 139 verses 23 and 24 memorize that and live a life of examine and surrender.
[time=1691] Any offensive way, whether it be riches, selfish pleasure, perfectionism, or even religion at the expense of a relationship with God.
[time=1700] What would it look like if you surrendered for an audience of one?
[time=1706] I'll tell you one thing it would look like.
[time=1710] You would begin to shape your heart and your desires to be like his.
[time=1715] And you would know, you would experience God's will for your life, it's what we all want.
[time=1721] David surrendered for an audience of one.
[time=1723] Second, David battled for an audience of one.
[time=1727] 3,000 years ago, they would have these one-on-one battles and winner would take all.
[time=1733] You put up your best guy, we'll put up our best guy and winner will take all.
[time=1736] The problem was the Philistines had a giant named Goliath and he was taunting the God of Israel.
[time=1742] He was taunting Israel for what they believed and then walks this shepherd boy, poet, musician who would later become Israel's warrior and king and he didn't like it.
[time=1754] Remember, he had a heart surrendered for an audience of one and he hears this and he didn't like it.
[time=1759] And he says, I'll take the guy on and he can't wear the armors too heavy.
[time=1763] King Saul's armors too heavy.
[time=1764] And so he just takes those three smooth stones and a slingshot and says, this is how he take care of the lion and the bear, I'm gonna take care of this guy.
[time=1770] And so a confident David walks out and look what he says when we pick it up in 1 Samuel 17 verses 45 through 47.
[time=1778] David said to the Philistine, you come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel whom you have defied.
[time=1789] This day the Lord will hand you over to me and I'll strike you down and cut off your head.
[time=1794] And today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.
[time=1804] All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves.
[time=1809] For the battle is the Lord's and he will give all of you into our hands.
[time=1816] And I don't think it was said in a whisper.
[time=1818] Notice what he said there and it's what we see in Psalm 60 verse 12.
[time=1823] There's this shift to battle for an audience of one that has to occur, I want you to write this down.
[time=1827] There's this shift of perspective of victory.
[time=1830] It's the shift in perspective of victory from we to he, from we to he.
[time=1838] A shift in the perspective of victory from we to he.
[time=1841] Look what it says in Psalm 60 verse 12, with God we will gain the victory and he will trample down our enemies.
[time=1849] We begin to make our battles for what David said, for the advancement of God's kingdom in the hearts and lives of people.
[time=1859] That's what we begin to battle for.
[time=1861] The advancement of God's kingdom in the hearts and lives of people.
[time=1865] And here's what he does.
[time=1866] When we shift from the perspective of victory from we to he, he does two things.
[time=1871] He delivers us and he sustains us.
[time=1873] That's what victory is.
[time=1874] He delivers us and he sustains us.
[time=1877] He delivers us Psalm 144 10, Psalm 144 10.
[time=1882] To the one who gives victory to the kings, who delivers his servant David from the deadly sword.
[time=1888] He delivers me, that's what victory is.
[time=1890] Psalm 140 verse seven, David wrote this.
[time=1892] Psalm 140 verse seven.
[time=1894] Oh sovereign Lord my strong deliverer, who shields my head in the day of battle.
[time=1900] And then he sustains us.
[time=1902] He sustains us Psalm 1835.
[time=1905] Psalm 1835, you give me your shield of victory in your right hand sustains me.
[time=1911] You stoop down to make me great.
[time=1915] Now this is big and I want you to write this down.
[time=1918] He delivers us and he sustains us because we've shifted our perspective of victory from we to he.
[time=1924] We're battling for an audience of one.
[time=1927] And here's what happens.
[time=1928] It frees us to give him the credit.
[time=1934] We no longer have to say it's about us.
[time=1936] We're free to give God the credit for the advancement of his kingdom and the hearts and lives of people.
[time=1944] We'll change from saying look what we did to look what he did.
[time=1950] Look what we did to look what he did.
[time=1956] As God was transforming my business life, you still cruise international and auction company.
[time=1960] And I felt that I had held that back.
[time=1962] And so I surrendered that to God.
[time=1964] One of the things I tried to do among many things was when I was in town, we'd have a stand up, eight minute or so meeting with eight guys.
[time=1973] So you talk about a minute each.
[time=1975] And we would talk about the task on the forefront of our schedules.
[time=1978] A good way for me to stay on top of what we were trying to accomplish that day, make every day meaningful.
[time=1984] And so here's what we would do.
[time=1987] Here's the risk that I took in that environment.
[time=1990] And this meeting was optional.
[time=1993] I said so at the end of the after we talk about those things, I just want to take a minute, we'll pray for them.
[time=1998] We'll just pray, bring God in to this part of our lives and we'll see what happened.
[time=2003] Well, my cousin Kenny had lost his father in a car accident.
[time=2006] He's his mom and my mom or sisters.
[time=2008] And Kenny did a change in careers after his father passed away.
[time=2011] And Kenny was in those meetings.
[time=2013] Kenny's a lot like Kelly Bird.
[time=2016] He's loud, he's funny, he's a cheerleader.
[time=2020] And so I'm at an auction, he traveled with me all over the world.
[time=2023] We do an auction about every weekend.
[time=2024] And I'd say sold $100,000.
[time=2026] He'll hear Kenny go, oh, sound way to go.
[time=2029] I'm Sal, he's a guido, that's a whole different story.
[time=2032] But he'd be yelling things like that all the time.
[time=2035] And we get done with an auction, it was successful.
[time=2039] And he says, oh, Sal, look what we did today.
[time=2042] You know, that kind of thing.
[time=2043] Well, after a season of these stand-up meetings
[time=2050] and after an auction, I'll never forget the first time I heard this.
[time=2055] Kenny came out, he was all excited, and he goes, oh, Sal, look what he did.
[time=2060] I said, what?
[time=2061] He goes, look what God did.
[time=2063] We prayed for this, Sal.
[time=2066] I thought, oh, my goodness, that's what battling for an audience of one looks like.
[time=2074] When you shift your perspective of victory from we to he, instead of saying, look what we did, you'll start saying, look what he did.
[time=2083] See, we had changed.
[time=2084] We needed to make a profit to survive, but we had let that profit be a function of relationships.
[time=2089] We believed that remuneration would follow relationships, that profit would follow your relationship with people.
[time=2094] And so I made wisdom the measurement stick, as crazy as that sounded, of success for my business.
[time=2103] And the money thing seemed to just take care of itself, and we begin to see God do an amazing thing.
[time=2108] It was the same thing in Manila.
[time=2110] We found ourselves saying again and again and again.
[time=2112] He brought four guys, five guys from five different walks of life together, and we just found ourselves saying to each other and to ourselves, look what he did.
[time=2124] Look what he did.
[time=2124] What would happen if you would change your measurement of success from we to he?
[time=2129] If you would look to advance his kingdom in the hearts and lives of other people.
[time=2133] I'll tell you what, he'd deliver you, and he'd sustain you.
[time=2137] And you'd move from saying, look what we did to look what he did if you would not only be surrendered for an audience of one, but if you battled for an audience of one.
[time=2145] Third, David's was strengthened, David's strengthened for an audience of one.
[time=2151] This is kind of tucked away.
[time=2152] It's 1 Samuel 30 verse 6.
[time=2154] That book's starting to close, and here's what I find.
[time=2156] See, David had just taken a bunch of guys out.
[time=2158] This is before he's king, and he went out on a raid, and he conquered, he won.
[time=2161] He took care of business on what he was trying to do.
[time=2163] But while he was gone, somebody else came in and raided his guys' families, took their spouses, took their kids, and this isn't a good scene.
[time=2174] So you can imagine the emotions that are coming up, they've got all their success from victory, and they come and they see this.
[time=2182] David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him, this guy's going to be king, they're going to stone him.
[time=2190] Each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters.
[time=2192] They'd been taken away.
[time=2194] But look at this.
[time=2195] David found strength in the Lord his God.
[time=2206] Times are really tough right now, and I think they might be worse even than what we're being told and what we're seeing, because I think it runs deep.
[time=2214] And I got to tell you, I'm livid about the economic problems.
[time=2217] I think just a thimble full of wisdom would have prevented a lot of it, let alone what wisdom all away would have done.
[time=2226] And so I'm really frustrated and I'm upset, and I don't like it, and I hate it.
[time=2230] But I've had to ask myself lately, do I want to believe what I'm sharing with you right now, or do I really believe it?
[time=2238] Can I emotionally buy into, he is my strength?
[time=2242] That I don't have to trust in the economy.
[time=2245] And David shines a little light on this in the Psalms.
[time=2248] It's Psalm chapter 18, verse 1, and here's what he says, I want you to write this down, strength is the person of God.
[time=2256] Strength is the person of God.
[time=2259] I love you, O Lord, my strength.
[time=2262] Now this is a little bit of a nuance.
[time=2264] I want you to catch.
[time=2265] One author says it this way, he says, we should seek God's face instead of his hands.
[time=2271] I'm going to say it this way, we need to seek who rather than do.
[time=2276] See, when times are tough, we need to seek who God is, the picture of his face, who he is, and have that heart shaped in us.
[time=2285] And not so much his hands, what he can do for us selfishly.
[time=2290] It really reveals a heart.
[time=2291] You see one's unselfish, one's selfish.
[time=2294] I'm not saying you can't ask God to do anything for you, but there's this shift in perspective because David saw strength in the person of God.
[time=2300] Not necessarily what he was going to do for him.
[time=2303] But here's what happens when you do that.
[time=2304] I want you to write this down, he lifts and he gifts.
[time=2307] He lifts and he gifts.
[time=2310] He lifts us from the old God does when we seek his face, to who, not his hands to do.
[time=2315] And he gifts us with the new.
[time=2317] He lifts us from the old and he gifts us with the new.
[time=2321] Here's how David said it in Psalm 40, verse two.
[time=2324] He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and the mire.
[time=2330] And he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.
[time=2335] He lifted me from the old, from the struggles, from when I was weak.
[time=2341] And he gifted me with the new, a firm place to stand.
[time=2345] He said this in Psalm 34, 18.
[time=2347] 17 years ago, I was really struggling with this kind of a thing.
[time=2351] And this verse just resonated in my heart.
[time=2354] And I've kept it and I've thought about it.
[time=2357] I've meditated on it and I've shared it with other people.
[time=2359] Anybody comes to me who's struggling with something like this.
[time=2362] I just say, hey, here's what this verse did to me.
[time=2365] In Psalm 34, 18, David wrote it.
[time=2367] He said the Lord is close.
[time=2369] Lord is close to the brokenhearted.
[time=2371] Whatever you're going through, he's close.
[time=2375] And he saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[time=2379] Lord is close to the brokenhearted.
[time=2382] And he saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[time=2384] He lifts us from the old struggles, from our weaknesses.
[time=2387] And he gifts us with the new.
[time=2389] He restores us.
[time=2391] I had another opportunity to apply it when I first got to Manila.
[time=2393] We fly across the international date line.
[time=2396] It's 12 hours, different in time zone there.
[time=2398] And the first night, we got in a hotel that wasn't too bad.
[time=2404] But my room, something wasn't right.
[time=2408] And I couldn't sleep.
[time=2409] I'm already a mess.
[time=2410] I stayed up all night on the plane reading Tony Dungy's book.
[time=2413] I couldn't put it down.
[time=2413] And so I'm there and I just can't sleep.
[time=2417] There's nothing to watch on TV that I can understand.
[time=2419] And the picture wasn't very good anyway.
[time=2422] But like I said, I used to do auctions every weekend.
[time=2426] And the car fumes eventually would just kill me.
[time=2428] The headaches would just kill me.
[time=2431] I feel like I want to throw up.
[time=2432] I would take Tylenol 3 with me to get through those things.
[time=2438] And this night was feeling like that all over again.
[time=2441] And you don't really realize what's happening for everyone.
[time=2444] I'm smelling smoke.
[time=2446] And you've probably been in a hotel room where maybe somebody's smoking next door or close to the vent below or something.
[time=2451] And that's just like filtering your room.
[time=2452] So I figured that's what's going on.
[time=2453] I'm thinking, I'm dying.
[time=2454] And I've got like seven hours for them.
[time=2456] I'm going to see another human being again.
[time=2458] I'm dying.
[time=2458] This is killing me.
[time=2459] I just-- oh god, why am I here?
[time=2463] I started justifying why I should have been home.
[time=2465] I should be with my kids.
[time=2466] We were doing this this week and that this week.
[time=2468] And what am I doing here?
[time=2469] This is crazy.
[time=2470] Why did I do this?
[time=2472] And I just struggled all night.
[time=2473] I didn't sleep all night.
[time=2475] And then you'll appreciate this, Kelly.
[time=2481] I woke up the next morning, knocked on Derek's door across the hallway.
[time=2485] He opens his door.
[time=2486] I go, what is this?
[time=2487] It's our room, man.
[time=2492] I said, your room.
[time=2494] Your room is nice.
[time=2495] What's that smell?
[time=2499] He said, I think it's that guy.
[time=2502] And I said, no.
[time=2504] Your room doesn't smell like smoke.
[time=2506] I'm dying over there with a headache.
[time=2509] He goes, dude, we'll just change your room.
[time=2511] Let's go.
[time=2511] Come on.
[time=2512] And we walked down to the front.
[time=2513] He saw my room, smelled the smoke and everything.
[time=2515] We walked down the front.
[time=2516] The lady started laughing.
[time=2518] It's kind of like a smoker's room.
[time=2519] And smoke was-- she said the one anybody smoking beside me.
[time=2522] The smoke was in the carpet.
[time=2524] The smoke was in the walls.
[time=2525] The smoke was in the bedspread.
[time=2526] And that's what was just killing me.
[time=2528] And they put me in a nice new room, smoke-free, smoke-free.
[time=2532] New meant new carpet.
[time=2534] And so it was just another time, that next morning,
[time=2542] where I got to say, you know what?
[time=2545] I needed strength for an audience of one.
[time=2547] This is-- I was out there.
[time=2548] I was really-- I was in the muck, in the mire, in the mud, in the way I was feeling about life, a very good thing that we were doing, that God was orchestrating in us.
[time=2557] And He strengthened me again.
[time=2560] What would happen if you would renew your strength, your weakness, whatever that may be, in the person of God who lifts and gifts?
[time=2569] If you would focus on the-- and seek the who, not the do, we already know what one of those things would happen.
[time=2577] He would lift and He would gift.
[time=2578] He would lift you from that old when you are strengthened for an audience of one from those struggles.
[time=2583] And He will gift you with the new.
[time=2585] So David, he surrendered for an audience of one.
[time=2587] He battled for an audience of one.
[time=2588] He was strengthened for an audience of one.
[time=2591] And David worshiped for an audience of one.
[time=2597] The Ark of the Covenant had the Ten Commandments in it.
[time=2599] And in a battle, the Philistines had taken it away.
[time=2602] And when their Philistines got it, everything started going bad for them, and they wanted to get rid of it.
[time=2606] They wanted to give it back.
[time=2607] They kind of sent it away to the Israelites.
[time=2612] And when the Israelites got it, they were bordering on using it as a good luck charm.
[time=2618] And they were being a little careless with it, kind of like an idol.
[time=2621] And in fact, David had conquered Jerusalem, and he had wanted to bring in the Ark three months prior, and they were being very careless with it.
[time=2630] In fact, the guy reaches up to kind of stop it from falling off.
[time=2633] It sounds like it's a good thing.
[time=2634] But the writers trying to tell us is they were being very careless with the Ark of the Covenant, the House of the Ten Commandments.
[time=2639] And the guy died.
[time=2640] The guy died that reached up and tried to save it.
[time=2642] So David had three months to think about this.
[time=2644] And the Ark set in this guy's place, and the guy was blessed, and his family was blessed, and everything they had done.
[time=2649] And David got to reflect, probably, on how they were to handle that with great care and reverence.
[time=2655] And so David brings it in three months later with great care to Jerusalem.
[time=2661] And this is where we pick it up in 2 Samuel 6, 14.
[time=2665] David wearing a linen ephod, which is a priestly garment, danced before the Lord with all his might.
[time=2674] David wearing a linen ephod, danced before the Lord with all his might.
[time=2681] Now his wife Michael, his first wife, who was King Saul's daughter, didn't like it very much.
[time=2686] And she kind of told him off about it.
[time=2689] And you might think, well, what's that all about?
[time=2692] Well, she was probably influenced by her dad Saul, who had taken worship of God from a 24/7 thing that was in David's heart, to probably kind of like a convenient thing whenever he wanted it to work for him, trying to manipulate the deed of the universe, maybe to an hour a week.
[time=2713] Now, wait a minute, that should sound kind of familiar.
[time=2716] 'Cause here's the risk.
[time=2718] We run the risk of limiting worship to a particular style in a certain building during a specific hour
[time=2729] on one day during the week.
[time=2731] Our risk of people take our face seriously is that we run the risk of making worship, limiting it to a particular style in a specific building during a certain hour on a certain day of the week.
[time=2749] And David's showing this radical paradigm shift
[time=2755] and she didn't like it.
[time=2756] So here's what he goes on to say to her, not liking it.
[time=2759] Verses 21, 22.
[time=2760] David said to Michael, it was before the Lord who chose me rather than your father.
[time=2766] See, it was before the Lord, the dancing.
[time=2768] It was before the Lord, and the Leninist father, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house, you too, Michael, when he appointed me ruler over the Lord's people Israel, I will celebrate before the Lord.
[time=2780] I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes, but by these slave girls you spoke of, she didn't like him just roping in front of the slave girls.
[time=2789] I will be held in honor.
[time=2791] Here's what he's saying, write it down, worship 24/7.
[time=2795] Worship for an audience of one 24/7.
[time=2799] Look how you see this in his heart, it's in Psalm 145 that David wrote, Psalm 145.
[time=2804] I will exalt you, my God, the king.
[time=2806] I will praise your name forever and ever.
[time=2809] Every day I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever.
[time=2813] Great is the Lord who most worthy of praise is greatness no one can fathom.
[time=2817] And he concludes with this in verse 21.
[time=2820] My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord.
[time=2824] Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever, Mitch's translation, worship God 24/7.
[time=2831] Worship God the most where people expect it the least.
[time=2835] Worship God the most where people expect it the least on the athletic floors and fields.
[time=2841] In your business, in your career, in work.
[time=2845] In fact, do you know that there's a Hebrew word that's translated both worship and work?
[time=2850] One word translated both worship and work tells you what God's perspective really is.
[time=2856] It's A-B-A-D, all bad.
[time=2858] So I can remember all bad as I was pronounced.
[time=2860] Numbers 439 uses it.
[time=2862] Worship and work the same.
[time=2865] Do you know what happens when you begin to worship God 168 hours a week?
[time=2868] When you worship God 24/7, he begins to bless us with this awareness of his presence.
[time=2876] 168 hours a week, not just one.
[time=2879] And it's what we want.
[time=2880] He blesses us with this awareness that David had of God's presence, 168 hours a week.
[time=2888] When we were in Manila, we did two outreach nights.
[time=2892] We hung out all day with the kids.
[time=2894] I visited the Christian school outside of Manila.
[time=2897] I visited what was happening inside.
[time=2900] I'm sorry, outside the dump.
[time=2902] I visited this initiative inside the dump.
[time=2905] This whole initiative was started by a pastor who was on television and radio, and he just felt compelled by God to, in essence, be strengthened, worship, battle, surrender for an audience of one.
[time=2916] And he said, I just feel like I'm supposed to start these outreaches in the 12 worst places in Manila.
[time=2922] Well, this was the worst.
[time=2923] And I learned later through a prayer that he gave after when we were driving away, that where we were doing the outreaches was the worst of the worst.
[time=2931] And so basically everybody, the hundreds of people who came, they all surrounded their lives to Christ, but there was one unique situation.
[time=2937] It was a man and his family who sat in the front row the second night where I taught him the invitation.
[time=2943] And he was a government official, kind of like a precinct commitment or award chairman.
[time=2950] He led the worst part of this kind of loose ad hoc government
[time=2957] in the dump in the Philippines, in Manila.
[time=2962] And so he would deal with organized crime, he would have all kinds of issues.
[time=2965] And this pastor's approach to him and to anybody like him would be, do you know that the Bible calls you a minister, a government guy calls you a minister.
[time=2973] He'd say, what?
[time=2974] And that's what everybody would say, what?
[time=2975] What are you talking about?
[time=2976] Well, this guy came, that invitation, and he and his family surrendered their lives to Christ.
[time=2981] The RSVP, yes, to the invitation.
[time=2983] And they were now gonna go back and they were gonna live a life of worshiping God the most where people would expect it the least.
[time=2990] They would worship him 24/7, even in his work.
[time=2994] And we got to watch how that response led to the restoration of a leader, which would lead to the restoration of a community.
[time=3001] So I wanna ask you today, what would happen if you would worship God the most?
[time=3007] Were people expected the least?
[time=3011] What would happen if you would worship God the most?
[time=3014] Were people expected the least, 168 hours a week?
[time=3017] What if you would worship God in the classroom?
[time=3020] What if you would worship God on the athletic courts and fields?
[time=3025] What if you would worship God in your career?
[time=3031] What would happen if you would worship God 24/7, 168 hours a week?
[time=3038] Well, I can tell you one of the things that would happen.
[time=3040] He would begin to bless you with this almost, he can touch it.
[time=3045] An awareness of his presence, 168 hours a week.
[time=3050] David surrendered for an audience of one.
[time=3053] Begin to understand God's will and desires for his life.
[time=3059] David battled for an audience of one.
[time=3062] He shifted his perspective from we to he and he was delivered and he was sustained by the God of the universe.
[time=3069] David was strengthened for an audience of one.
[time=3071] His strength was in the person of God and he discovered that he would lift and he would gift.
[time=3075] He would lift him from the old and gift him with the new.
[time=3077] David worshiped for an audience of one and that was a worship that was 24/7, 168 hours a week and David was blessed with this unique awareness of the presence of God.
[time=3087] But fifth, David repented for an audience of one.
[time=3093] David repented for an audience of one 'cause he sometimes we're gonna fall short, we're gonna get it wrong.
[time=3099] This is second Samuel 12, 13.
[time=3101] David had sinned with Bathsheba and an affair
[time=3107] and he had orchestrated the murder of her husband in battle and he gets confronted by the prophet Nathan and it's really interesting who he confronted him in a parable and David realized he's the guy in the parable and here's David's response.
[time=3122] Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the Lord." He's repenting for an audience of one.
[time=3130] Nathan replied, "The Lord has taken away your sin.
[time=3134] "You're not going to die." But David then writes this Psalm.
[time=3137] Psalm 51 is written out of this event, out of this occurrence.
[time=3142] And so we get to see really inside David's heart what's going on.
[time=3145] It's Psalm 51.
[time=3146] So looking verse four, how he says it, Psalm 51.4.
[time=3149] Against you, you only, I have sinned.
[time=3153] And done what is evil in your sight, he says to God.
[time=3156] So that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.
[time=3161] Look, he's saying, "I'm sinned against an audience of one.
[time=3165] "I need to repent for an audience of one." And it goes on to verse 10.
[time=3169] Creating me a pure heart, oh God.
[time=3173] One with no unmixed devotion.
[time=3176] Pure means totally devoted.
[time=3181] And so when it's impure, it's a mixed devotion.
[time=3183] One foot out with God, one foot in, like we talked about before.
[time=3186] And renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[time=3189] He's repenting for an audience of one.
[time=3191] And then he describes what the sacrifice looks like.
[time=3195] And that's verse 17.
[time=3196] The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart.
[time=3202] Oh God, you will not despise.
[time=3206] Contrite, it's DACA in Hebrew.
[time=3208] It means broken or sore.
[time=3211] And here's what it means.
[time=3212] It means to rub together.
[time=3213] I want you to write this down, contrite heart.
[time=3215] It means to rub together, meaning worn or bruised.
[time=3219] It's deeply grieved with Godly sorrow.
[time=3223] It's not sorry I got caught, it's sorry I did the wrong.
[time=3227] And here's what we see in a familiar verse in 2 Corinthians 7, 10, it says it this way.
[time=3231] Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation.
[time=3235] And leaves no regret.
[time=3238] But worldly sorrow, the sorrow that I got caught brings death.
[time=3243] So this contrite heart is what repenting for an audience of one really means.
[time=3248] And there's this confession that comes with it.
[time=3250] And here's the result.
[time=3251] So we have the contrite heart, the result is we are forgiven.
[time=3255] We are forgiven.
[time=3257] And look how Dave wrote about it in the Psalms.
[time=3259] David wrote about it in the Psalms.
[time=3260] Psalm 32, verses one and two.
[time=3265] Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
[time=3271] Blessed is the man who sinned, the Lord does not count against him, and in whose spirit there is no seat, deceit.
[time=3277] There is no pretense when I confess.
[time=3279] I'm agreeing with God on what's going on in my life.
[time=3281] Before I do that with a contrite heart, I have this pretense that I'm okay.
[time=3286] Everybody does it, it doesn't matter.
[time=3288] And that's that pretense.
[time=3289] Psalm 103, verses 10 and 12, two very important verses in the Bible.
[time=3295] God, he does not treat us as our sins deserve, David wrote, or repay us according to our iniquities.
[time=3302] God does not do a one-for-one punishment of our sins.
[time=3306] And then Psalm 103, 12, as far as the east is from the west, so far as he removed our transgressions from us, we are forgiven.
[time=3315] He is not going to recount those sins against us once we stand forgiven.
[time=3321] It's God's kindness that brought me to repentance.
[time=3327] It's that relationship with God that brought me to repentance.
[time=3332] And when I encountered those kids in the dump for the first time, I'm telling you, I repented like that for my crummy attitude the night I got there, because something special was happening.
[time=3345] God was at work, and I was just privileged to be in that place.
[time=3351] And man, did he do at work.
[time=3354] What would happen in your life if you repented for an audience of one?
[time=3359] If you repent with a contrite heart when you get it wrong and you would return to God, I'll tell you what one of the things that would happen is you would be forgiven.
[time=3371] So what would it look like?
[time=3373] If in 2009, you would live for an audience of one.
[time=3380] What would happen if you surrendered for an audience of one?
[time=3384] If you fully surrendered your heart and your desires, if you would memorize the refining prayer of examine and surrender?
[time=3390] I tell you one of the things that would happen is he would shape your hearts and desires to be like his, clarifying his will for your life.
[time=3399] What would happen if you would live for an audience of one in 2009?
[time=3404] What if you battled for an audience of one?
[time=3407] What if you would shift your perspective of victory from we to he?
[time=3412] I can tell you one thing that would happen.
[time=3413] He'd deliver you and he would sustain you in your spiritual battles and he would free you to give him credit for the victory, the advancement of his kingdom and others.
[time=3425] What would happen if in 2009, you would live for an audience of one and you would be strengthened for an audience of one.
[time=3432] And you found that strength is in the person of God as the strength in the who and not the do.
[time=3437] You would find one thing I can tell you that.
[time=3438] He lifts and he gifts.
[time=3440] He will lift you from the old when you are weak and you're in struggles.
[time=3443] And he will give you with the new, with the spirit of him in you, a new place to stand.
[time=3447] What would happen if in 2009, you would live for an audience of one?
[time=3451] What if you worship for an audience of one?
[time=3454] Worship 24/7, worship God the most where others expect at the least in your work, in your career, in your studies, on the courts, on the fields.
[time=3463] I can tell you one thing that would happen, he would begin to bless you with an awareness of his presence that you could almost judge.
[time=3471] What would happen if you would live for an audience of one and you repented for an audience of one in 2009?
[time=3476] What would happen if you had a contrite heart when you got it wrong?
[time=3479] I can tell you one thing that would happen is that you would be forgiven.
[time=3483] You know, each one of these five things seems to include this promise,
[time=3489] a specific promise, and we know that in Christ, all God's promises are yes in amen, because God gives us the heart of Christ,
[time=3499] whose spirit resides in us so that we may live for an audience of one.
