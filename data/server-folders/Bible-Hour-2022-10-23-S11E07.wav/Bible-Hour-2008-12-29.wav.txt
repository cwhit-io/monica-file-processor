[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Hi everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour broadcast.
[time=34] It is great to have you with us.
[time=36] It seems like weeks since I've been with you.
[time=38] It has been a great holiday season, and I want to wish every one of you a happy new year.
[time=43] We are really looking forward to what God has in store for us.
[time=47] We're thankful that so many of you, each and every week, are a part of this discussion, a part of what God's doing here at Blackhawk.
[time=55] We look forward every week, and we will in this new year look forward.
[time=59] Look forward every week to sharing with you the things that He's teaching us and the places that He's leading us.
[time=65] We're glad that you're along with us for the ride, and we can't wait to see what's ahead in 2009.
[time=72] Hey, I want to take a moment if I can, and just say a few words about something that has transpired just over the last week and a half.
[time=80] Many of you may be familiar with one of the great churches in our community, Brookside Community Church, and the pastor at Brookside, Jim Pearson, Jim and Linda have been a part of the Brookside family for years as he has given leadership there.
[time=97] Jim and Linda have really been a part of the community of faith here in Fort Wayne for even longer.
[time=102] Years ago, Jim was even on staff here at Blackhawk.
[time=106] They are good friends of ours, and they are good friends to many of you in the Fort Wayne community.
[time=113] And just in this last week, Jim and Linda experienced a great tragedy and a great loss as they were informed of the death of their oldest son, Drew, in a car accident.
[time=126] Tragically, down in Florida, just a day after Drew and his wife, Emily,
[time=132] gave birth to their very first child, a little girl.
[time=136] And as we heard about what transpired and as all of us who know Jim and Linda and who knew Drew and his brother Kyle, as we think about the whole family, Emily's mom and dad, all of them, a part of this community here in Fort Wayne.
[time=153] Our hearts just went out to them.
[time=155] And I wanted to just say to all of you today, when you see this broadcast, we will have already celebrated the life of Drew Pearson at a memorial service here at Blackhawk this past Friday. But I wanted you to pray for them.
[time=171] Many of you do what we ask you to do.
[time=174] Many of you are sensitive to the things that God is leading us toward here at Blackhawk.
[time=178] And Blackhawk these days is just so very mindful of the hurt and the loss and the confusion that Jim and Linda and Kyle and their whole family
[time=189] and the hopes, what they've experienced is a difficult trial.
[time=193] And all of them are very aware of who God is.
[time=196] They're all very aware and believe still in the goodness of God.
[time=200] All of them trust God deeply.
[time=202] And yet these are situations that stretch a person's faith.
[time=207] And we want you to pray.
[time=209] Would you pray for the piercings and would you pray for the hopes?
[time=212] Would you pray for Emily, Drew's wife, and their little baby girl?
[time=217] And would you pray for strength and courage to face these next days in a way that would bring great glory and honor to God?
[time=225] We're thankful, so very thankful for the life that Drew lived.
[time=229] I knew him personally.
[time=231] He made a huge impact in the life of my oldest son, Russell.
[time=235] Drew carried himself with great integrity.
[time=238] Drew carried himself with great energy, not only for golf and for his family, but also for the Lord.
[time=245] And as those down in Florida got to know him over the last several years, the impact he made on their life for the kingdom was substantial.
[time=253] We're sorry for their loss.
[time=256] So very grieved by what the piercings and homes are going through these days.
[time=261] And our hope is that you will, as a community of faith, lift them up in the days to come.
[time=266] Write them a note, contact them if you can, but let them know you're praying for them.
[time=271] And praying that the God of all comfort will comfort them with the very same comfort you and I have been comforted with in days gone by.
[time=279] Thank you for letting me share that with you.
[time=282] Thank you for your prayers, for the piercings and the hopes, and may God be honored as we continue to live and face this life with all that it brings in the days to come.
[time=294] You should be mindful of us.
[time=300] What do you see that's worth looking our way?
[time=311] We got free ways that we never should be.
[time=321] Sweet release from the grip of these chains.
[time=334] I can just straining from the weight, my heart no longer can keep from singing.
[time=344] All that is within me cries for you alone.
[time=351] The glory is fine, you bet, you bet.
[time=364] God with the rest, my heart sings a brand new song.
[time=370] The day is paid, these chains are gone, you bet, you bet.
[time=379] God with the rest.
[time=385] What do you know?
[time=390] Our hearts don't deserve to go be still your show.
[time=400] And love we cannot afford.
[time=408] I can just straining from the weight, my heart no longer can keep from singing.
[time=418] All that is within me cries for you alone.
[time=426] The glory is fine, you bet, you bet.
[time=439] For my heart sings a brand new song.
[time=445] The day is paid, these chains are gone, you bet, you bet.
[time=454] God with the rest.
[time=460] Such a tiny offering, oh, compared to calories.
[time=470] Never than this, within your feet.
[time=481] Such a tiny offering, oh, compared to calories.
[time=491] For never than this, you bet at your feet.
[time=504] All that is within me cries for you alone.
[time=511] The glory is fine, you bet, you bet.
[time=518] God with the rest.
[time=524] My heart sings a brand new song.
[time=530] The day is paid, these chains are gone, you bet, you bet.
[time=539] God with the rest.
[time=547] All that is within me cries for you alone.
[time=554] The glory is fine, you bet, you bet.
[time=561] God with the rest.
[time=567] My heart sings a brand new song.
[time=573] The day is paid, these chains are gone, you bet, you bet.
[time=582] God with the rest.
[time=591] The Lord Almighty is with us, the God of Jacob is our fortress.
[time=598] Those who are far from you will perish, you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
[time=604] But as for me, it is good to be near God.
[time=609] May the Lord our God be with us, as He was with our fathers, may He never leave us or forsake us.
[time=617] Come near to God and He will come near to you.
[time=620] Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[time=627] But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation of people belonging to God,
[time=635] that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.
[time=643] The Virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and they will call him Immanuel,
[time=650] which means God with us.
[time=654] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Now the dwelling of God is with men, and He will live with them, they will be His people,
[time=666] and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[time=674] Worthy is the Lamb who was saved, holy, holy is He.
[time=690] Sing and do song to Him who sits on Heaven's mercy seat.
[time=703] Worthy is the Lamb who was saved, holy, holy is He.
[time=722] Sing and do song to Him who sits on Heaven's mercy seat.
[time=1007] Well, I want to, in a way, I want to kind of continue a discussion that we've been
[time=1015] in for months.
[time=1016] In another sense, it's kind of a new start with a new year.
[time=1019] I want to ask you this morning this question.
[time=1021] Why disciples need doctrine?
[time=1027] Let me back up a moment before we jump in.
[time=1030] Let me remind everybody here and those listening online or via the broadcast.
[time=1035] Why it is, we're talking about disciples.
[time=1039] We have been talking a lot about disciples these days here at Blackhawk.
[time=1044] We've been teaching about how disciples lived.
[time=1047] We've been teaching about the pattern and the rhythms of their lives as they followed after
[time=1053] the Son and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=1055] We're teaching about and reembracing this concept of discipleship all because, all of it,
[time=1061] because when we as a leadership team a year and a half ago studied the gospels and the book of Acts, we rediscovered, if you will, the great truth about discipleship and its
[time=1073] priority in God's heart.
[time=1075] It was a year and a half ago as your leadership team here at Blackhawk studied and discussed and prayed that we were amazed all over again by what God did with disciples.
[time=1086] Or maybe better said what God does with disciples.
[time=1091] What God does with individuals and with a church that's deeply devoted to following,
[time=1097] listen, to following the teaching, the practice, and the pattern of our Lord.
[time=1104] Individuals and a church that are deeply devoted to following the teaching, practice, and pattern of our Lord.
[time=1111] We've seen the gospels in the book of Acts, Jesus imitators.
[time=1116] We've seen in the Gospel in the book of Acts Christ followers.
[time=1120] We've seen disciples who were radically transformed themselves and who were used by God to radically
[time=1128] transform their world.
[time=1131] And last I checked with most of you were very, very interested these days at Blackhawk.
[time=1137] We have a strong and growing desire to be individuals and to be a body that would be used by God
[time=1145] to radically and deeply transform this world that God's allowed us to live in.
[time=1151] Now how all that happened with them?
[time=1153] What that looked like?
[time=1154] Well, we tried to capture a bunch of that in our most recent series entitled "Elemental."
[time=1161] God's design for the life of a disciple.
[time=1164] Many of you in the room this morning were a part of that series that we went through over the fall months.
[time=1169] All of those messages are available for you.
[time=1172] You can view them.
[time=1173] You can listen to them online at the Blackhawk Ministries website.
[time=1177] The five elements that we studied, the discussion that we had basically went like this.
[time=1182] We wanted to look at the life of Jesus.
[time=1185] If He is the one that we are to follow, if it's His practice and His pattern, when it comes to living and choosing and loving and values, if it's Jesus' pattern that we are to follow.
[time=1198] If it's the pattern and practice of those first disciples who themselves were so devoted to following after Him,
[time=1205] we looked at that picture as a whole and from the Scriptures came up with these five elemental patterns.
[time=1213] We studied them in depth.
[time=1215] We saw that in the Scriptures there was a pattern in the disciples' lives of prayerfully abiding.
[time=1220] There was a great devotion to the Word of God, a great devotion to Scripture.
[time=1225] There was a commitment to missional serving, not serving that was just serving to be serving.
[time=1230] It was serving to further the kingdom.
[time=1232] It was serving to make disciples.
[time=1235] It was serving in an effort to pass along God to others.
[time=1238] There was great purpose and there was great passion.
[time=1241] There was great forethought behind the serving that they did.
[time=1245] They were devoted to transformational community.
[time=1249] We spent a couple of weeks talking about that.
[time=1251] There was in Jesus' life and there was in the lives of those in that first church this enormous commitment to gathering, which is what we're doing right now, but there was an equal and sometimes even greater commitment to the kind of transformational community
[time=1269] that we're a part of, smaller settings where lives were shared, where people experienced and lived life together in smaller settings,
[time=1280] intimate settings that promoted honesty and accountability and transparency.
[time=1286] We talked about how in those settings then and in those settings even today, we get a chance to flesh out the things that we talk about and teach about in larger settings like this, and I want to just say to every one of you again, I hope and I'm going to keep saying this.
[time=1302] I keep bumping into folks and in conversations that you'll have with me in the hallway around here, I'll just keep asking you what smaller setting are you a part of?
[time=1312] It's absolutely vital.
[time=1314] It's absolutely a necessity to your spiritual development, Christ being formed in you.
[time=1320] We have to find ourselves in these smaller settings where the truth of God's Word can get further discussed, can get further applied, where accountability can enter into the everyday of your life, where relationships can grow deeper and the help and the encouragement that we receive from those deepened relationships can be more and more a part of your everyday life.
[time=1343] There's smaller setting opportunities on Sunday mornings.
[time=1346] Ask us, we can get you connected to those.
[time=1348] There's smaller setting opportunities in homes during the week, small groups that would be absolutely more than willing to have you come and be a part of what God's doing in their midst.
[time=1358] Here's one for you.
[time=1359] Beginning on the 18th of January, this is an announcement plugged into a message.
[time=1365] On the 18th of January, on Sunday night, there's a new smaller community beginning.
[time=1370] It's going to initially start, we'll see what God does with it.
[time=1373] It'll start up in 257, 259. This small community is going to be open to anybody.
[time=1379] Anybody, you young people, you middle-aged, you senior adults, anybody can come.
[time=1385] It's going to be led by Steve Webster and a team of folks that Steve's putting together, and this smaller community will be initially kind of built around the study of the Book of Mark,
[time=1395] and they're going to study it, and they're going to discuss it, and they're going to apply it, and they're going to try their best to better understand it, and they're going to also, while studying, the Word of God be devoted to the other four elements as well.
[time=1407] You'll serve together if you're a part of that smaller setting.
[time=1411] You'll pray together. You'll be a part of community together.
[time=1415] You'll study God's Word together, and anybody can come.
[time=1419] And if you're not connected right now to a smaller setting, I hope you'll write that down.
[time=1423] Sunday night, 6 p.m., January 18th, it begins, and I can't wait to see what God's going to do with that.
[time=1430] Anybody can come, no matter who you are, they'd love to have you.
[time=1433] So we've been talking a lot about disciples.
[time=1436] We've tried in recent months to help you, and I want you to write these two things down, we've tried to help you in recent months understand better your identity and your calling, your identity, and your calling.
[time=1449] Let me just talk about that just for a moment.
[time=1452] What we've said about your identity and your calling in recent days is this, if you've personally and fully surrendered your heart and life to the Lord, then you fundamentally, according to God's Word, fundamentally, you're not fundamentally, you're not a teacher.
[time=1468] Fundamentally, you're not a businessman or a woman.
[time=1470] Fundamentally, you're not a police officer.
[time=1472] Fundamentally, you're not a retail sales clerk.
[time=1474] Fundamentally, you're none of those things that you and I give ourselves to,
[time=1480] for the most part, as the week progresses, no fundamentally, God's Word teaches us
[time=1486] that when we fully surrender our heart and lives to Him, we are to be disciples.
[time=1493] We are followers of Jesus Christ who happened to work at a bank.
[time=1498] We're followers of Jesus Christ disciples who happened to lead a church.
[time=1502] We're followers of Jesus Christ who happened to be a stay-at-home mom.
[time=1506] We're followers of Jesus Christ who are engaged in a thousand different endeavors.
[time=1511] But at the core of those endeavors should be in your heart and mind and in mind this commitment to being a disciple, identity.
[time=1521] Our calling is to follow Him.
[time=1523] Our calling isn't to follow the crowd.
[time=1526] Our calling isn't to follow after what people think.
[time=1530] Our calling isn't to follow after the making of money or the making of friends.
[time=1535] Our calling that you and I are to answer to is to follow Him.
[time=1541] His patterns, His practices, His teaching.
[time=1545] We've been talking a lot these days about disciples.
[time=1549] Well, here's something I've realized.
[time=1552] Maybe just in the last few weeks as I've continued to read the Scriptures and think about raising up and establishing disciples here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1561] I believe this. I believe that part, I believe a big part of what brought great clarity and strength of conviction to their lives and part of what enabled them to stand so firm in a day that was so filled
[time=1578] with persecution and spiritual trial.
[time=1581] Let me read that to you again. I believe this.
[time=1584] I believe it at the core of my being and I think it's absolutely pertinent to you and me and our lives this day and this culture and this world that God's placed us in.
[time=1595] I believe that part of what brought great clarity and strength of conviction to their lives and part of what enabled them to stand so firm in a day that was so filled with persecution and spiritual trial was their deep and very clear understanding of the deep truth about God.
[time=1619] This morning I want to introduce some of you.
[time=1623] For others of you I want to remind you to this concept of these first disciples who were clearly, you see it.
[time=1634] You see it as you read and study these letters that they read and studied.
[time=1642] You realize that these first disciples were taught doctrine.
[time=1647] They were taught the deep truths about God.
[time=1651] They were familiar with biblical doctrine.
[time=1654] Spiritual biblical doctrine was a regular component of the teaching and instruction they received on a regular basis.
[time=1662] The apostles wrote about it and the first century disciples studied it and digested it and talked about it and tried their best to live it out.
[time=1671] For them, and I don't want you to miss this, for them, unlike for many of us today.
[time=1677] For them, unlike for many of us today.
[time=1682] And when I say us, I mean those of us in this room and I mean those of us in the church.
[time=1688] For them, unlike for many of us today, there was no gap between everyday life and theology.
[time=1697] There was no distance or disconnect between doctrine and daily living.
[time=1704] These things were combined.
[time=1706] These things were a part of everyday life.
[time=1708] Their understanding of it and their practice of it I believe is what gave them great strength and clarity.
[time=1715] Perhaps this is a good point in our discussion this morning to stop and let me do that and define for you what we mean by the word doctrine.
[time=1724] What we actually mean by the deep truth about God.
[time=1728] If you've got a pen, I'd encourage you to write these things down.
[time=1731] Doctrine, my friends, is a few things.
[time=1734] There's a couple of ways we could say it.
[time=1736] Doctrine is a system of beliefs, write that down.
[time=1739] Doctrine is a system of biblical beliefs, in this case, or truths accepted as authoritative.
[time=1748] Doctrine is a body of teaching, if you will, made up of specific principles that are deemed to be collectively right and worthy of one's adherence, a body of teaching, deemed to be collectively right and worthy of one's adherence.
[time=1767] Doctrine is the truth about God.
[time=1770] Doctrine is the foundational truth about God, who he is, how he's acted, what he's accomplished.
[time=1778] Doctrine is the foundational truth about God and God's dealings with man.
[time=1785] It is a system, one person said it this way, it is a system of specific scriptural principles that are absolute and true.
[time=1795] And because of that veracity, that truthfulness, because of that veracity, they are worth these system of beliefs,
[time=1805] biblical truth about God and his dealings with man.
[time=1809] Doctrine, this person said, is worth our complete embracing and following.
[time=1817] So here's what I was thinking.
[time=1819] Early in the week, my thought was I was going to just kind of take us through some examples of doctrine.
[time=1825] And I gave Katie, I believe it was three examples of biblical doctrine, and the thought was we were going to make our way through all three, not only make our way through all three examples of biblical doctrine, but then I wanted to, because this is really the whole point of the study, I want to make sure that even today in our introduction, even today at the outset of this discussion, we've got to make sure we keep it practical.
[time=1849] I want to make sure we understand how doctrine can be connected to daily living,
[time=1855] how it should be connected to daily living.
[time=1858] And so as the week went on and as I continued to write and think, I thought, you know what, three's probably a little aggressive, let's just do one, and we're going to do that, but let me show you the three things. Just by way of example.
[time=1869] Here's three, examples of doctrine, examples of a God-given system of authoritative beliefs. There you go.
[time=1877] We could talk about the doctrine of salvation.
[time=1881] If you study that in certain settings, they would call that the study of soteriology. We could talk about, we could learn more about the doctrine of sin. There's a lot that the Scripture has to say about sin and its origin and its effect and its cure. There's a whole doctrine of sin called hermatiology. We could look at the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, how that works, how the role he plays, his effect on you and me as believers. It's called newmatology. And I think sometimes we get a little doubt on this whole discussion of doctrine or theology.
[time=1921] I mentioned the word theology, and many of you just kind of start to crumble. Many of us in the room, we hear the word doctrine.
[time=1929] We hear the phrase theology and we immediately begin to check out because there is this thought in us that while some might want to talk about so teriology or homartiology or newmatology, we're thinking, heck, I'm just trying to stay married.
[time=1945] You know, we're just trying to raise our kids. I'm just trying to get to work tomorrow. And see, see, that's the mistake. That's what I was talking about earlier. There was no gap for them. There was no distance for them.
[time=1965] There was no leap. There was no disconnect. The deep and great truths about God and his dealings with people.
[time=1973] And the everyday circumstances of their lives were intricately woven together. There was great connection there.
[time=1981] And there should be for you and for me. It shouldn't wig us out. And you know what the fact of the matter is, it has wigged us out.
[time=1993] We have developed a gap between daily living and doctrine. And our daily living shows it.
[time=2005] Our choices and our thinking and our values and the circumstances that we place ourselves in and the patterns that we establish show a great void of understanding and practice of the deep and very real truths about God.
[time=2025] Does that make sense? We need some help. We need to bridge the gap. And so I want to just begin this morning. This is all by way of introduction. And I thought this morning we could just kind of get familiar with the concept by taking one of those three. So I chose the doctrine of salvation. And let's just take some time this morning in the time that we've got remaining. And let me just do my best to in a brief but I hope significant way get your mind and your heart thinking toward what God's truth says about this idea of salvation. Doctrine 101, okay?
[time=2061] You're ready? You get your pens out. You get your hearts open. Let's talk about and let's learn about. And then as we close today, we're going to most important thing here. We're going to apply. We're going to show how it is that the doctrine of salvation matters in your everyday life in mind. But first, let's take a look. True salvation.
[time=2081] So, Terriology. Here we go. True salvation is right these things down. Number one, I want you to write this down. True salvation is from God alone.
[time=2089] Do you understand that? Many of you do. Some of you may be just figuring this out.
[time=2093] True salvation is from God alone. Would you turn in your New Testament to Ephesians? After first and second Corinthians comes Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[time=2105] Go to Ephesians 2 and let's pick it up at verse 4.
[time=2109] Can we do that? Ephesians 2 verses 4, 5 and 6. True salvation, my friends, is from God alone as we jump in on the doctrine of salvation.
[time=2121] It says in Ephesians 2, 4, but God. There it is.
[time=2125] But God. Being rich in mercy.
[time=2129] Because of His great love with which He loved us.
[time=2133] Even when we were what? Even when we were dead in our transgressions. Even when we existed in our sin separated from Him. The Scripture teaches that we existed in this place of death. This place of separation.
[time=2149] And when we were dead and separated in our sin, in our transgressions God, back to the very beginning of verse 4.
[time=2157] Now we're in verse 5. God made us alive together with Christ. By grace you have been what?
[time=2165] Saved. There it is. Salvation. And in this salvation, verse 6, He raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[time=2177] Salvation, my friends, is from God. And from God alone. Go to Romans.
[time=2181] Go back a few books. Past Corinthians now.
[time=2185] Go into your left. Go to Romans 5. Open up to Romans 5, 6. If you would. Romans 5, 6 through 11.
[time=2193] God, my friends, is where salvation comes from.
[time=2197] It says in Romans 5, 6, for while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die. But God, there it is again, but God demonstrates his own love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us by God's decree, by God's design, by God's demand. This is what God enacted. This is what God did. This is the redemptive plan that God put into play. God did it. Nobody else.
[time=2237] While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us much more than having now been justified. "By his blood we shall be what?" There it is. Saved. Saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if while we were enemies, interesting. If you go back to verse 6 in verse 6 we were helpless. I just want you to see this.
[time=2261] What a work God did.
[time=2265] In verse 6 we were helpless. At the end of verse 6 we are ungodly. In the middle of verse 8 we were sinners. And here in verse 10 we were enemies. For if while we were all the above.
[time=2285] For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son. Much more having been reconciled we shall be what? Saved. Saved. Salvation.
[time=2297] By His life. And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through whom we have now received the reconciliation, the salvation, the doctrine of salvation. My friends, true salvation is from God alone. If we were in a seminary classroom, if you were in a Bible college taken theology 101, I mean these are the kinds of things you'd begin to be taught. This is the stuff you'd begin to chew on and wrestle with.
[time=2325] Salvation. Salvation is from God and it's from God alone and nobody else. He orchestrated it. He designed it.
[time=2333] He carried it out. Secondly, write this down.
[time=2337] True salvation is received by faith alone.
[time=2341] True salvation is received by faith alone. Go back to Ephesians 2.
[time=2345] Many of you, some of you in the room, may have caught this and you may have caught this years ago. For others of you it may be a new discovery here. Let me show this to you. We oftentimes recite Ephesians 2, 8, and 9. Sometimes though we miss something in here that's really really important. True salvation is from God received by faith.
[time=2365] Ephesians 2, 8, and 9. It says, "For by grace," Ephesians 2, 8, "for by grace you have been saved through faith." Okay, stop right there.
[time=2377] So salvation comes by the grace of God. The mechanism though, through which salvation is experienced is this thing called what?
[time=2385] Faith. It says it right there. "For by grace you have been salvationed." You've been saved.
[time=2393] "For by grace you have been saved." And that has transpired.
[time=2397] That has become a reality because of this thing called faith. And we in our minds we often think you know that's kind of the part we played. By grace we were saved through the faith that we exercised. And this does get a little bit tricky but just bear with me because look what the text says.
[time=2417] It says, "By grace you have been saved through faith." And then we oftentimes just read these next several words really quick and I think in reading it or saying it quick we lose it and that not of yourselves we say and that not of yourselves. But wait, slow down. "For by grace you have been saved through faith." And that...
[time=2445] What's that? Say it louder. The faith was not of who?
[time=2453] It's not of yourselves. You didn't even do that.
[time=2457] I mean, here we go. You did sort of but it came from him.
[time=2465] And we won't get into all the implications of election and free will this morning. We'll save that for Doctrine 201.
[time=2473] But I want you to see that.
[time=2477] The faith that we exercise even that... I mean just keep reading. For by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It... what's it?
[time=2489] The faith is a gift.
[time=2493] It's a gift of God that no one should boast. What does the text say?
[time=2497] It is the gift of God not as a result of work so that no one may boast. My friends God saved you. God is the only one who saved you. God is the only one who can save.
[time=2513] And there is this... there is this transaction that occurs. There is this you and I exercising faith and I believe that. I believe the Bible is replete with instances where people made decisions if you will.
[time=2525] They chose this instead of this but the faith required to do that even it is a gift from God.
[time=2533] Received by faith alone. Romans 10.
[time=2537] Go back over to Romans if you would. Many of you in the room. Maybe even some of you kids have memorized this and could even say it to me right now but just go to Romans 10 verses 9 and 10.
[time=2549] Watch for this... for this faith alone. This belief.
[time=2553] Romans 10 9 says that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe... here's the faith.
[time=2561] Believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be what? There it is. Salvation.
[time=2569] For with a heart a person believes resulting in righteousness and with the mouth he confesses resulting in what? Say it. Salvation. There it is.
[time=2581] My friends the doctrine of salvation teaches us that true salvation is from God alone. It is received by faith alone.
[time=2589] He is eternally secure. Write that down. True salvation does not leave you. True salvation cannot be lost.
[time=2597] True salvation is eternally secure.
[time=2601] I was thinking about... I was thinking about in first hour I even said that one of the great initial discoveries of my spiritual life one of the things that right out of the gate September, October 1983. One of the great truths that initially just jumped off the pages of Scripture was shown to me by a guy who was discipling me, who was making a spiritual investment in me trying to help me figure out and learn what it looked like to follow after Jesus.
[time=2633] And he was a great friend and a mentor and a father in some ways and he sat down with me week after week after week after week and we studied the very first thing we studied was Ephesians. And it was in Ephesians 1 that we came across Ephesians 1, 13 and 14 and it just lit me up. Still does. Look at this. Ephesians 1, 13. In him it says, this whole context here is about salvation and redemption in Christ.
[time=2665] It says in him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your what, say it, salvation. Having also believed, and many of you in the room have done that, you have heard the gospel of truth and you have bowed the knee of your heart, you have by faith, a faith provided you by God, you have committed yourself to him completely and holy and those of you in the room that have done that, those of you in the room that have committed your lives to him and your hearts to him fully. Look what happened.
[time=2701] In him you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation, having also believed you were sealed.
[time=2709] You were sealed in him with the Holy Spirit of promise who was given as a pledge of our inheritance with a view to the redemption of God's own possession to the praise of his glory. When you believed when the gospel of your salvation, when that, when that was enacted and the scriptures teach that the Holy Spirit came and you were sealed, locked up, packaged, boom, there, it's amazing in my Bible. At the bottom it says sealed, God's own spirit comes to indwell the believer, right?
[time=2745] Spirit of God comes to indwell the believer and secures and preserves his eternal salvation. The sealing of which Paul speaks refers to an official mark, an official mark of identification placed on a letter, contract or other document. That document was there by officially under the authority of the person whose stamp was on the seal. God, through the work of the Holy Spirit, at the point of regeneration when you and I are saved, God stamps you with who's seal. His seal.
[time=2781] You are his and nothing will take you away from him.
[time=2785] Nothing can undo what he has accomplished. God alone saves. It's received by faith alone. It is an eternally secure salvation. Let me give you one more to write down.
[time=2797] It's fruitful. Very important that we talk about this. Very important that in your understanding of the doctrine of salvation that you see this, my friends, according to God's word, true salvation is fruitful. Galatians go back just a few pages to Galatians 5.
[time=2817] This is a great concept and I want to make sure you understand how this works. Look at the very first phrase of Galatians 5-22, but the fruit of the spirit.
[time=2829] Stop right there. Okay, we just got saved by a faith that God alone provided and when that salvation occurred we were indwelt. We were literally kind of like overtaken internally at the soul and spirit level. We were indwelt by the Holy Who, by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2849] The spirit of God comes to dwell in us.
[time=2853] And when the spirit of God, when all of that is genuine, when all of that has really occurred and that of course is between you and God, the spirit of God comes in and the spirit of God doesn't just kick it.
[time=2869] The spirit of God isn't just like, okay, I'm in here and now I'm going to just chill.
[time=2873] No, the spirit of God begins to produce in you this thing that the scripture's called fruit, evidences of the fact that the spirit of God is at work in your life. And he names these evidences. They're called the fruit of the spirit. And when someone is saved according to the biblical doctrine of salvation, it says the fruit, the evidence of that salvation is the fruit of the spirit.
[time=2901] Love, your life will be characterized.
[time=2905] You won't be a perfect every day, never failing example of these things, but your life will be characterized by this. And these things I believe will be growing, not regressing. There will be patterns of growth. The fruit of the spirit is love.
[time=2925] Joy, peace, patience, kindness.
[time=2933] Some of you are saying stop, please.
[time=2937] I'm saying stop, please. Goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control against such things there is no law.
[time=2953] According to the scripture, in the doctrine of salvation, when salvation truly occurs, there will be fruit. You know what?
[time=2961] You mostly know me well enough. I don't walk around this place and I don't walk around my life with a list of the fruit of the spirit eyeing you up one side and down the other. Every time we get together or talk deciding if I think you are really saved, keeping score on your fruitfulness. It's not how it was designed to be handled.
[time=2981] It's not how we approach that. I tell you what though, on the other hand it's something, I would say this, it's something that as a parent, I think is really, really helpful, helpful in that I know it guides Kebra and I in the way we pray for our kids. We pray that they will come to a place in time where they would surrender their hearts in lives to Christ as that begins to happen. You know, you believe as a parent with all your heart that everything that got said and that prayer was true and they meant it and that's a good thing and you celebrate that. It's a very interesting thing. As days go by, as weeks and months and years go by, you begin to pray that the spirit of God would be at work producing fruit in that young man or that young lady's life. It is a way, are you with me? It is a way of knowing.
[time=3033] I mean, I can only think of one other thing in the scripture, obedience.
[time=3037] It's clear in the scripture that obedience is a evidence of salvation. The fruit of the spirit, obedience, things that we pray for, for our kids and for others who come to faith in him, the doctrine of salvation. Alright, hang with me here. There's more that we could get into.
[time=3057] So much more. But I think that's a decent shot, don't you think?
[time=3061] I mean, that just gives you some things to kind of look at and consider and begin to understand. Now here's the thing, I want to make sure that we ask and we'll ask this over the next couple of months. So what?
[time=3075] I want you to ask the question. Okay, so that's amazing truth and it is. I mean, that just can fill your heart and mind and lead you and I to places of great gratitude and amazement and awe.
[time=3087] But I don't want there to be a gap. I want you to be amazed by it and in awe of it. But I want your understanding and mind of it to be so personal and real that we actually can begin to understand how it can be fleshed out in the everyday of life.
[time=3103] Here's just a few examples of how you might want to begin to think about this.
[time=3107] Practical implications for the doctrine of salvation and we'll just kind of come at it like this. We'll ask a few questions.
[time=3115] Practically now, trying to apply what you've just learned this morning in some everyday life circumstances that you or I might find ourselves in.
[time=3127] True salvation is from God alone.
[time=3131] That was the first point. Okay, let's ask this. Can the Prophet Muhammad save you?
[time=3139] I mean, I just picked that one. You understand what the fastest growing religion in the world is and it's not Christianity. It's Islam.
[time=3151] You understand that? And you do understand, right, that it's not just the fastest growing religion in Iraq. It's not just the fastest growing religion in the Middle East. It's the fastest growing religion where? Here.
[time=3163] You understand, don't you? That your kids are going to meet somebody in school. You understand that you're going to meet somebody at the gym.
[time=3171] You understand that somebody's going to move in down the block. And I'm not saying those things in a way to prepare you for battle. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about preparing your hearts and minds for the reality of what you believe. You're going to have to answer questions at some point in time and it's going to be about salvation. I think, personally, I think salvation is a big deal, my friends. I think it's paramount.
[time=3195] And the Biblical truth is that Muhammad can't save you. Nor can Confucius, nor can the teachings of Joseph Smith, nor can the Pope, nor can anybody other than who?
[time=3207] Jesus Christ, God the Father and the salvation that he alone made possible.
[time=3215] Received by faith alone was the second point we made.
[time=3219] Let me just ask you this. It sounds like it kind of ties in with the first question, but I think it's important to ask. Can you earn your salvation?
[time=3227] Can you earn it? Can you be good enough?
[time=3231] Can you be rich enough? Can you be kind enough?
[time=3235] Can you be a faithful church-attender enough?
[time=3239] You know the real question here is, can religion save you?
[time=3243] That's a little tricky. Sometimes I'll ask folks that and they go, well sure it can.
[time=3247] I mean religion? That's what religion does. Religion saves you no. No, no, no. Remember, we've talked about this religion by its purest definition is a system of spiritual beliefs that puts the onus of responsibility for salvation on you.
[time=3263] And it looks different in a lot of different religions and it all, but it all comes together. It all shakes out the same. And whether it's heaven or nirvana that you're trying to get to, religion puts the onus of responsibility on you to do things, to be good enough, to earn your way by this or that, to get there. Religion sends people to hell.
[time=3287] Christianity, which is from God alone, received by faith alone, brings redemption and salvation.
[time=3295] You can't earn your salvation. You know what?
[time=3299] Your kids are going to ask you about that. Kids are going to hear about that.
[time=3303] You're going to make friends someday. You're going to be in discussions and you're going to have an opportunity to, I hope, lovingly, yet with great clarity, represent what the truth is about salvation.
[time=3315] Number three, eternally secure.
[time=3319] I'll just ask it, can you lose it? No.
[time=3323] Now, I'll tell you what, of all the questions I've been asked as a dad, and I'm not just talking about at the age of seven, eight, and nine, of all the questions I've been asked, this one's one that comes up a lot.
[time=3339] And I think you and I need to be doctrinally savvy to speak, to be able to talk with, especially young hearts and minds who hear things or just wonder, have doubts.
[time=3351] And I think it's so important. I could give you it if you want them. I'll give them to you later.
[time=3355] You can call me or email me. I mean, there's about ten passages that we could go to to help you and any one doubting.
[time=3363] Understand better how secure their faith really is.
[time=3367] Number four is your life-producing is proof. We have to ask that question today.
[time=3371] You have to be willing to ask yourself that question. Your understanding of the doctrine of salvation just compels you.
[time=3379] When you understand that according to the scriptures, salvation equates with fruitfulness, you have to ask yourself the question, "Am I being fruitful? Is there spiritual fruit evident in my life?" So here's the point, doctrine matters. We're going to go.
[time=3399] And let me say this, no book in all of scripture gives us a more comprehensive and practical treatment of biblical doctrine than the first eight chapters of the book of Romans. And that is exactly what we're going to do in these next week study. The great doctrine found in the first eight chapters of Romans, it will blow you away. It will stretch your heart and mind. It will bring you to your knees in gratitude. It will allow us a great chance to, as a family, grow together in our understanding of these great truths and hopefully our application of the same. Amen?
[time=3439] Father God, thank you for the morning. We mean that God, thank you for this privileged opportunity to open up your word and to see again the great truth, the great doctrine that is there for us to understand, to not be afraid of, to not be intimidated by it, but God to embrace it, to learn it, to wrestle with it, to talk about it, and God to apply it, to allow these great truths to affect the way we choose and the way we are married and the way we parent and the way we work. God, may our hearts be open for the things you'll have for us in the days to come. Well thank you for it.
[time=3479] In your son's name we pray. Amen.
