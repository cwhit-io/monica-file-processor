[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour this morning.
[time=34] It's great to be with you again.
[time=36] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk as the senior pastor, and we're so thankful that you've joined us again this morning.
[time=45] You know, over several months here at Black Hawk, we have been making a very big deal about being a disciple.
[time=53] We have been re-elevating and re-embracing this idea of discipleship, this picture of this pattern that Jesus left for those who followed after him.
[time=65] Our commitment to being disciples and our deep interest in those first disciples who followed after him in such powerful and significant ways.
[time=76] You know, as we've thought about it, kind of over the break this year, discipleship, being a disciple, following after the pattern and teaching of Jesus.
[time=86] We've really settled here in the month of January and probably the month of February in our Sunday morning times.
[time=93] We're going to look at one thing as it relates to the teaching of Jesus and the teaching of Scripture.
[time=100] That's very important, and that is this.
[time=102] Disciples need doctrine.
[time=106] That's right, many of us are intimidated by even the word doctrine.
[time=111] Many of us shy away from doctrine or discussions of theology.
[time=116] When the truth is this, we desperately need doctrine.
[time=121] When you define doctrine as the deep truth about God, then you understand that this is the very thing that formed the foundation of what brought such great power and conviction to the lives of these early disciples.
[time=136] And we long for that same power and we long for that same conviction.
[time=140] We want to understand doctrine, deep truth about God, and then live it out in a very practical, loving way.
[time=148] And so I hope you'll join us in the coming weeks.
[time=151] We've started a new series from the Book of Romans, one of the great books of the New Testament that has within it some of the most powerful treatment of doctrine you'll find in all of Scripture.
[time=163] We think it matters.
[time=164] We think it matters a great deal that you and I would be not doctrinally illiterate, but instead alive and full of the great truth of God so that we can share it and live it out in the everyday of our lives.
[time=178] So join us.
[time=179] I can't wait to see what God will teach you.
[time=182] I'm having a great time seeing what he's teaching me and we look forward to these weeks together as we consider the great doctrine of our Lord and the great opportunity we have to follow after him.
[time=194] [MUSIC - 80 seconds]
[time=284] - You know for a while quite some time here at Blackhawk, we've been talking about and trying to lift up the value of a priesthood, of believers who are willing to go.
[time=296] And we've talked about going across the street, we've talked about going across town, we've talked about going across the country, a priesthood of believers willing to go even across the world.
[time=307] And every chance we get to just genuinely thank and embrace those who have gone.
[time=314] In this case, across the world, we like to do that.
[time=318] And this morning we're privileged to have with us Ken and Alice Cole.
[time=322] I'm gonna have them stand in just a moment, but I think if I've got my facts straight, I think Ken and Alice, I think you guys first went to the Philippines in '76, if I'm not mistaken.
[time=333] That makes them like over 30 year priests who have been willing to go and pass along the great truth of our God to a people far, far away.
[time=343] I think the Philippines opportunity was lengthy.
[time=347] I believe in early 2002, three somewhere in there, you guys began a new ministry in Thailand.
[time=352] And the coals are now, I love the way their card says this, they're helping Asians reach Asians.
[time=360] I think we oftentimes think of missionary work of, it's going and helping people find Jesus, which is good.
[time=366] I think they're still interested in doing that, I'm sure.
[time=370] But now they're helping Asians reach other Asians, they're investing deeply in the church of Asia by investing themselves in those Asians who know the Lord and they're training them and equipping them.
[time=382] And they've been doing this my friends for years and years and years.
[time=385] And they've been faithful and they're a part of our family.
[time=388] Ken and Alice, would you stand?
[time=389] And would you all just welcome them back?
[time=391] (audience applauding)
[time=397] - Thanks you guys, it's good to have you here.
[time=400] Well hey, if you would open your Bibles to the book of Romans, let's jump back in to why disciples need doctrine?
[time=409] Why disciples need doctrine, a study from the book of Romans?
[time=414] And let me just say that sentence, just a little differently, I'll add a word, we'll make it a question instead of a statement.
[time=421] Why do disciples need doctrine?
[time=429] Let me first say this, last week I tried my best to answer that question as clearly and succinctly as I could.
[time=436] Why was it that disciples for instance in that first church, why were those first disciples so familiar with doctrine?
[time=445] Why did they have it taught to them?
[time=447] Why was it written about?
[time=449] Why were the deep truths of God just commonplace and the lives of those that followed after our Lord?
[time=456] Why do disciples need to better understand and better comprehend doctrine?
[time=463] Let me say it to you this way, because doctrine is a matter of life and death.
[time=468] I believe that because doctrine is a matter of life and death.
[time=471] I said it last week because doctrine matters.
[time=475] The deep and profound truth about God, you'll see this on the screen, the deep and profound truth about God, which right there is succinctly how we kind of defined doctrine for you, kind of a working definition, if you will, as we continue in this discussion.
[time=492] The deep and profound truth about God should connect to the everyday activity of your life and mine in deep and profound ways.
[time=502] Doctrine matters.
[time=505] I believe we've become in some ways as a church.
[time=510] And I mean the big sea church.
[time=513] I mean the little sea church.
[time=514] We could talk about churches everywhere across the world or we could talk about ours in this vein.
[time=521] I believe we've become in some ways doctrinally illiterate.
[time=525] I believe we've become doctrinally illiterate and for someone like me whose responsibility before God, it is to make sure that the body of Christ is equipped and taught the deep truths of God, this has become a bit unsettling for me in my own heart, just to be honest and forthright with all of you.
[time=548] I believe in some cases, the church has become doctrinally illiterate in our effort to be culturally relevant.
[time=557] In our effort to reach culture, we've shied away from doctrine because we think doctrine might be boring, we think doctrine might intimidate them, we think doctrine might overwhelm them.
[time=572] In our effort to be culturally relevant, we've in some cases become doctrinally illiterate when the truth is.
[time=581] The one thing culture needs most is the deep truth about God.
[time=587] It's the one thing that our society craves.
[time=592] It's the one thing that this world desperately needs is to see and understand the deep truth about God in practical loving and authentic ways.
[time=603] I mentioned at the conclusion of our teaching time last week that as it relates to doctrine, there is no New Testament book that gives us a more comprehensive or practical treatment of biblical doctrine than the book of Romans.
[time=616] And so this morning, we begin our doctrinal endeavor.
[time=620] This morning class begins.
[time=622] We're all gonna pull up a chair, get our notebooks out and do our very best to have the deep truth of God instilled in our lives not just for the sake of knowledge, but so that with that knowledge, you and I can live out this great truth, this great truth that the world that you and I live in desperately needs to see.
[time=641] So we begin this endeavor, a deep and profound journey that has the potential to lead the deep and profound living.
[time=648] And I just want you to hear that last phrase one more time.
[time=651] We begin this morning, our doctrinal endeavor, a deep and profound journey that has the potential to lead to deep and profound living.
[time=662] And I wanna just pause there for a moment
[time=668] and just admit to all of you, again, just honestly from the reality of my own heart and my own life.
[time=677] And if there's anybody in the room who feels the same way I feel or senses the same things I sense, then you can just say this with me.
[time=688] You can agree with this with me.
[time=691] But I feel more often than not.
[time=695] I feel as if my life lacks profound living.
[time=700] I long to live a life that's fuller.
[time=709] I long to live a life that day by day and week by week and month by month is more of a picture of what God designed you and I to live.
[time=720] I get the feeling sometimes you and I are chasing things that don't matter.
[time=724] I get the feeling sometimes that you and I are caught up in things that lack eternal significance.
[time=730] Feel like there are times when you and I in the church we're just marked by and defined by a life that lacks purpose and meaning.
[time=739] And I know as we begin this study, this is an opportunity for you and I, a deep and profound journey that has the potential to lead to deep and profound living.
[time=749] A meaningful, fruitful life.
[time=752] So I can't wait to see what God has for you and for me in the days to come.
[time=757] Romans, here we go.
[time=758] Romans begins.
[time=760] I told you we were gonna look at some doctrine and we'll just kinda take doctrine by doctrine as they come and at the beginning here of Romans 1, the doctrine of condemnation.
[time=770] You might wanna write that down.
[time=772] No, it sounds a little heavy, it is.
[time=776] There's a lot to it.
[time=777] The doctrine of condemnation or better said, man's great need, write that down.
[time=782] Man's need for the righteousness of God.
[time=787] This is the theme, the biblical subject matter that stretches from Romans 1, 18 all the way to the end of chapter 3, verse 20.
[time=797] And while that broader passage will be our focus over the next three weeks, let me just say a few things if I can about the first 17 verses of Romans 1.
[time=807] This introductory section, if you will, prior to verse 18, where this doctrine of condemnation, man's need for the righteousness of God begins, prior to that 17 verses.
[time=820] Let me just give you a few things to write down and think about, we'll just call it important truth from Romans 1, 1 to 17, number one, write this down.
[time=828] As you write this down, I'm gonna invite you this morning to store this thought in the forefront of your heart and mind, I'm inviting you to kind of have this be the, what are they, when you have your cell phone and you throw a statement or a picture up on the screen so that it's always there, it's a wallpaper.
[time=850] Am I saying that right?
[time=851] This is the wallpaper of our study.
[time=853] This is the foundation really in some ways of all that we're gonna see and hear about in the weeks and months to come.
[time=861] This is a statement found here in the first 17 verses that has far reaching implications for all that we'll see and come across in the days to come.
[time=871] Please make a note that the author Paul was consumed with the gospel.
[time=880] Paul was consumed Paul.
[time=883] Used to be the Christian killer Saul.
[time=886] He tortured them and he beat them and he persecuted the church as an unbeliever, devoted to his Judaism, God saves him, God redeems him, calls him to himself on the road.
[time=899] The Damascus, his name eventually has changed to Paul.
[time=903] He's called by God to be an apostle, set apart for the work of the gospel.
[time=909] Paul, my friends, as you read, Paul, as we study, you will see it and you will feel it and you will sense it.
[time=916] He is utterly and absolutely consumed with the gospel and the implications of the gospel and this might be a really good time to define the gospel.
[time=928] I pulled out some old seminary notebooks this week.
[time=932] I got online and looked up some different definitions.
[time=936] I just kind of scrolled back through my mind and all the things I've heard and all the things I've studied related to a definition of the gospel.
[time=946] I could have brought to you this morning pages and pages and pages of good, helpful, very true rhetoric surrounding this idea of what the gospel is.
[time=957] I talked to a good friend this week, I texted him and I said, hey, be thinking about a definition for the gospel for me.
[time=965] I want to talk about it this week and I'm thinking I'd probably maybe hear back from him in an email.
[time=970] I think I asked for a paragraph.
[time=972] He texted me back.
[time=973] Jesus died for our sins.
[time=979] And that, my friends, is probably the best way
[time=986] that we could say this.
[time=987] You wanted to find the gospel.
[time=990] The gospel is that Jesus died.
[time=994] A substitutionary death.
[time=997] Substitute for who?
[time=998] For you and for me.
[time=1001] Jesus died for our sins.
[time=1003] He died a substitutionary death and he died that death so that your sin could be forgiven and my sin could be cleansed because sin and a holy God don't match and there had to be because of who God is atonement for our sin and Jesus died for our sins.
[time=1023] That is the great truth.
[time=1024] That is the deep and profound truth of the gospel.
[time=1028] Everybody say it with me.
[time=1030] Jesus died for our sins.
[time=1033] Say it again.
[time=1034] Jesus died for our sins.
[time=1038] You're picking up doctrine well.
[time=1039] That's the gospel.
[time=1042] Jesus died for our sins.
[time=1044] And Paul, you'll see as we go on here, is consumed with this great truth.
[time=1050] I'm gonna just say this to you.
[time=1052] You could look this up later just for sake of time.
[time=1055] In Romans 1-1, you might wanna write that down.
[time=1057] In Romans 1-1, he says he's been called to represent the gospel.
[time=1062] In Romans 1-2-5, he actually articulates, you should read it.
[time=1067] He articulates and describes the gospel in its entirety.
[time=1071] In Romans 1-9, he says that he's in the midst of where he is, I mean geographically, location wise, where he is as he writes the book of Romans, he says he's preaching it with all of his heart.
[time=1085] And then in verse 15, he says he's eager to preach it where he has not yet been, which is Rome.
[time=1091] And then in verse 16, go ahead and look there if you would with me.
[time=1094] Romans 1-16, he declares that he is not ashamed of it.
[time=1099] Have you been at some point in time in your life?
[time=1104] Have you ever been in a circumstance or a situation where you were?
[time=1108] He says he's not.
[time=1110] He says, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[time=1115] "For it is the power of God for salvation "to everyone who believes to the Jew first "and also to the Greek." It was interesting as I read the notes down here at the bottom of my study Bible, the author here makes this comment on the "I am not ashamed" piece.
[time=1133] He says he had been imprisoned brutally, imprisoned in Philippi in Acts 16.
[time=1139] He had been because of the gospel.
[time=1141] He had been chased out of Thessalonica in Acts 1710 because of the gospel.
[time=1146] He had to be smuggled for fear of his life out of Berea in Acts 1714 because of the gospel.
[time=1154] He had been laughed at and mocked and ridiculed in Athens in Acts 1732 because of the gospel.
[time=1161] He had been regarded as a fool.
[time=1163] They made fun of him in Corinth because of his deep conviction and commitment to the gospel, 1 Corinthians 1, and they stoned him.
[time=1172] They killed him, left him for dead.
[time=1174] We've read the passage before.
[time=1176] Because of his commitment to the gospel, they dragged him out and they stoned him and he was dead.
[time=1183] Outside of Galatia in Acts 1419, but the notes say here, but Paul remained eager to preach the gospel in Rome.
[time=1192] He remains eager to live out his commitment to represent the gospel.
[time=1197] 1 Corinthians 9, 23, you might wanna write that down.
[time=1199] He says that everything he does, you see it there.
[time=1203] I do all things.
[time=1205] Think about that.
[time=1206] I do all things for the sake of the gospel.
[time=1210] And my friends, here in the classroom this morning, you all know that the gospel is what?
[time=1215] Say it.
[time=1216] Jesus died for our sins.
[time=1221] I think sometimes in all of our ministry activity, I think sometimes in the midst of all your ministry activity, I think sometimes in the midst of me doing all that I do, I think sometimes we lose sight of the gospel, of this great truth that God has called not only Ken and Alice Cole, but you and me, whether in Thailand or on your block, whether in the Philippines or Kenya or in your workplace, God has called you and I to represent this great truth known as the gospel.
[time=1256] Somebody could look at Paul's passion and his being consumed with the gospel and somebody could ask a very fair question and say why?
[time=1265] You may be asking it yourself.
[time=1266] So why was he so consumed with this?
[time=1269] Where does the passion for the gospel come from?
[time=1273] Why was it such a driving force?
[time=1276] Why was it everything to him?
[time=1280] We'll write this down.
[time=1281] Because only the gospel brings to man and Paul knew this, Paul knew this personally.
[time=1286] Because only the gospel brings to man the righteousness of God.
[time=1292] Get that, write that down, the righteousness of God.
[time=1295] Why is this important?
[time=1296] Well, go back to 116 and now we'll go to 17.
[time=1300] For I am not ashamed, remember, of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek, watch this, 17.
[time=1311] For in it, it is referring to the what?
[time=1315] Say it louder.
[time=1316] The gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed.
[time=1328] from faith to faith as it is written, but the righteous man shall live by faith.
[time=1334] Don't miss this, my friends.
[time=1336] The gospel is the only thing powerful enough.
[time=1341] Why do we emphasize that word powerful enough?
[time=1344] Go back to the text, if you would.
[time=1346] For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power, the Greek word there is dunamos, which is where we get our English word, dynamite.
[time=1356] The gospel is the only thing powerful enough
[time=1363] to provide salvation, only the gospel can rescue us, only the gospel can redeem us.
[time=1371] Nothing can overcome or destroy sin's grip and its consequence, but the dunamos of the gospel.
[time=1380] Only the dynamite of the gospel
[time=1386] brings the righteousness of God.
[time=1389] Okay, now bear with me.
[time=1390] So as you follow this train of thought, as you follow along in the text, it now basically insinuates, I love how scripture does that sometimes, it just kind of insinuates a question, just kind of leaves you hanging and you just in your mind, you just say it, okay, and we'll say it together here.
[time=1406] Okay, so why does man need, write it down?
[time=1410] Why does man need the righteousness of God?
[time=1415] He was passionate about it.
[time=1417] He was passionate about it, he says, because it's the only thing that can bring to man the righteousness of God, and so we ask the question, why does man need the righteousness of God?
[time=1429] Answer, well now we come to verse 18.
[time=1433] And this is quite averse, my friends, and it is the beginning of quite a section, and it just says there in verse 18, if you're gonna ask the question, why we need the righteousness of God for the wrath of God, verse 18, because the wrath of God is revealed.
[time=1456] Let me stop you right there for a moment.
[time=1460] Several weeks ago, I don't know how long ago it was, we were in Acts, and I was talking to you about something that was going on in Acts two, and I pointed out to you that it was in the original text, it was in the present active.
[time=1473] Do you remember that discussion we had about the present active tense and the Greek, and how it talks about something that has begun, and is ongoing?
[time=1484] Not your heads if you remember that.
[time=1487] All right, well watch this.
[time=1489] For the wrath of God is revealed.
[time=1492] We often think of the wrath of God as being something that comes at some point in time in the future, and we'll get to this discussion a little bit later, and you'll see that that is partly true.
[time=1504] But what I want you to understand and sense as we read through this is that this wrath of God is revealed in verse 18 is in the, guess what, tense, present active.
[time=1514] The wrath of God, my friends, today, the wrath of God for quite some time is being revealed.
[time=1523] We are seeing evidences of this, and you'll see evidences of this as we go forward.
[time=1530] The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[time=1537] There's that word.
[time=1538] Why does man need the righteousness of God?
[time=1542] Because the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men.
[time=1549] Men who suppress the truth and unrighteousness.
[time=1554] Let me just say this to you, simply and clearly.
[time=1557] Man desperately needs the righteousness of God.
[time=1565] Man is left to himself.
[time=1569] Hear me now, man is left to himself unrighteous.
[time=1574] I'll say it this way.
[time=1575] Man left to himself is very unrighteous.
[time=1580] Now, there may be some of you here this morning who disagree with this, and before we go on, we should just clarify or again clearly define unrighteous.
[time=1590] When I say man left to himself is unrighteous.
[time=1597] What is unrighteous?
[time=1598] It's important that we are clear on that.
[time=1600] Is unrighteous in the context of this discussion, the fact that that one man at some point in time has now committed 2,465,772 cents.
[time=1612] Now that he's gotten there, is he unrighteous?
[time=1617] Yes or no?
[time=1619] No.
[time=1621] Man is unrighteous because man has committed how many?
[time=1624] One.
[time=1626] And see, here's the thing, at that point, most of us in the room go, okay, that's a no-brainer then.
[time=1632] But there are so many today, and I'm just telling you because I speak with them, I talk with them, I know them.
[time=1640] It's not a no-brainer to them.
[time=1642] There are some who today still hold on to this idea that man is at a foundational level, benevolent or decent, and they believe it's society, it's culture, it's destructive influences that in time produce evil or unrighteousness in men.
[time=1659] They believe there are some who believe that man is good, and if you're here today and you believe that intrinsically at his very core, man or woman is good, I don't wanna disrespect you.
[time=1672] We're not here to in any way pick a fight with you.
[time=1675] I just want to because it's my job and my privilege to say to you the scriptures would say differently.
[time=1683] The scriptures would paint and communicate a much different picture than that.
[time=1689] A lot to say on that point, let me just show you Psalm 51.5 as a beginning point, Psalm 51.5, the psalmist here speaking to this in eight presence of sin and man says, "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity." From the womb, this is going on.
[time=1707] "And in sin, my mother conceived me." That's not referring to that mother and what she did on some weekend.
[time=1716] It's not talking about the activity that she engaged in to become pregnant, it's talking about the soul of that woman, it's talking about the intrinsic state of that mother and what intrinsically is passed along.
[time=1732] And so, okay, so now you're saying, okay, you're telling me I'm sinful because of my mom, it's my mom's fault, I'm sinful.
[time=1740] No, no, not really.
[time=1742] Actually, it's not your mom's fault.
[time=1744] Biblically, I would say to you, it's a guy named Adams fault, Adams fault.
[time=1750] Yes, go to Romans five, would you?
[time=1753] Go to just if you're in Romans, just go a few pages over to Romans five.
[time=1757] Let me just show you the beginning of verse 12.
[time=1760] I'll get a lot to say here, but we'll just take a couple of stabs at it.
[time=1764] Therefore, Romans five, 12, look at the wording here.
[time=1769] Therefore, just as through how many men?
[time=1772] One man, sin entered into the world.
[time=1776] Gosh, I read that first hour and it just struck me.
[time=1778] What a statement.
[time=1781] I mean, look at that.
[time=1783] Therefore, just as through, think about it, through one man and his choice, sin entered into the garden.
[time=1794] Sin entered into the, what?
[time=1798] The world, everything changes, everything hinges on this original sin.
[time=1807] Therefore, just as through one man, sin entered into the world and death came as well through sin and so death spread to all.
[time=1817] But I want you just to see that first part there, through one man, sin entered into the world.
[time=1821] Go on in Romans five to 16, Romans five, 16.
[time=1825] Talking about the gift, the gift of Christ, the gift of life, the gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned for on the one hand, the judgment arose from the transgression.
[time=1840] You see that, resulting in what?
[time=1842] Say it out loud.
[time=1844] Condemnation, we studied this morning the doctrine, the deep truth about condemnation.
[time=1851] But on the other hand, the free gift arose from many transgressions, resulting in justification.
[time=1856] In verse 18, where did sin come from?
[time=1858] So then, as through one transgression, there resulted, say it out loud.
[time=1865] Condemnation to all men, even so, through one act of righteousness, Christ, the cross, the gospel, there resulted justification of life to all men, for as through the one man's disobedience, this is where sin came from, the many were made sinners, you and me, even so, through the obedience of the one, Jesus Christ on the cross, exercising the great truth of the gospel, the many will be made what?
[time=1899] Man's great need for the righteousness of God.
[time=1904] Man left to himself in his humanness.
[time=1908] Man, kind, sons and daughters of Adam.
[time=1911] You might be sitting here this morning going, wait a minute, why do you just say Adam?
[time=1916] This thought, just hit me.
[time=1919] Why do you just say Adam, Adam and Eve send?
[time=1923] And I would say to you, you're right, they both did.
[time=1926] Some might even want to make a case that she sent first, but I just think it's interesting.
[time=1931] I think it's interesting how God talks about that whole deal here in Romans five, when God comes to the point where God's going to describe how this thing all happened, who was responsible for her?
[time=1945] Men, Adam, who should have said something?
[time=1951] Who should have done something?
[time=1954] Who should have knocked the snake out of the tree, stepped on it, cut it up in 10 pieces and be done with me?
[time=1960] Who should have stepped in and saved the day?
[time=1963] Adam, but he didn't.
[time=1968] He didn't say anything.
[time=1969] He was silent, withdrawn, unengaged.
[time=1975] And you and me men to this day struggle with the same thing.
[time=1980] Being silent and withdrawn and unengaged.
[time=1986] And is she responsible for the choices that she makes?
[time=1990] Yes, she is.
[time=1991] It's just interesting, I think, as you look at that.
[time=1995] It all came back to him.
[time=1998] Man, on his own, left to his natural tendencies is unrighteous.
[time=2003] And I now am going to read for you a lengthy passage.
[time=2010] I usually don't read to you passages that are this lengthy.
[time=2013] I'm going to try my best to get through reading it without commenting too much.
[time=2018] It didn't go so well first hour.
[time=2020] So I'm going to try again, second hour, but I just want to tell you that this isn't, this isn't light reading, what we're about to look at.
[time=2031] And this is the truth about man's need
[time=2037] for the righteousness of God.
[time=2040] This is the truth about man without God.
[time=2050] And we begin, verse 18.
[time=2057] It says in verse 18 of Romans 1, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, men who suppress the truth and unrighteousness." Okay, I'm going to stop right there.
[time=2070] You can't suppress, if you're suppressing something
[time=2077] then you're aware of what?
[time=2081] Something.
[time=2082] Does that make sense?
[time=2085] All right, that's all I wanted to say.
[time=2087] We'll keep going.
[time=2089] "Men who suppress the truth and unrighteousness," there's that word, "because that which is the wrath of God is coming against all unrighteousness." Men who suppress the truth, why?
[time=2101] Because that which is known about God, it's an interesting phrase there.
[time=2106] When I was looking at that this week, that which is known about God, it's really, it means that, that which is known, that which is there to be known about God, all that's there to be known about God is evident within them.
[time=2123] Wow, how come?
[time=2126] For God made it evident to them, my friends, here we begin to understand this idea of the conscience, the conscience of man.
[time=2134] What man intrinsically knows to be true about God?
[time=2139] Not because a preacher came, not because a book God delivered, not because they heard some message, but because they were made in the image of who?
[time=2148] God, and in their conscience, God made it evident to them.
[time=2153] They just know.
[time=2155] You say, how does that work?
[time=2157] At 45 years old, I'm proud to say to you, after years and years of study, I don't know.
[time=2164] But I believe it's true.
[time=2167] God made it evident to them for since the creation, and here we move from the conscience, now watch this, we move to creation.
[time=2176] For since the creation of the world, the mountains and the stars and the seas and the skies, for since the creation of the world, his invisible, his invisible attributes, those things that can be known about God, his eternal power and his divine nature have been sort of kind of seen?
[time=2194] No, they have been what?
[time=2197] Clearly seen by man, which men, all men, any man.
[time=2205] Clearly seen, being understood.
[time=2208] It's an important word there.
[time=2210] I'm not doing too good on the just reading, am I?
[time=2212] Being understood, it's not a mystery.
[time=2216] This which is evident within them, and this that they see and they connect the deity dots, if you will, in their mind, it's clear and it's understood through what has been made so that they, here you go, so that they are without, what, excuse.
[time=2235] For even though they knew God and they did, we do.
[time=2242] He just showed us how.
[time=2245] For even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations.
[time=2254] They knew it, they saw it, but they, like men do, they wanted to come up with their own deal.
[time=2261] They became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
[time=2270] Professing to be wise, which is what man does, because man wants to know, man's filled with pride, apart from God, they wanna be the ones in charge and in control, professing to be wise, they became fools.
[time=2283] And here comes one of the saddest verses in all of scripture.
[time=2287] And exchanged is what man did.
[time=2289] He exchanged the glory of God.
[time=2293] Man exchanges the glory of the incorruptible God.
[time=2299] Within man, there is the glory of God.
[time=2303] And man exchanges that.
[time=2306] To exchange something, you had to have it.
[time=2308] Man had it, man gives it away.
[time=2311] Man exchanges the glory of the incorruptible God for an image, do you understand image?
[time=2316] For a little thing of wood.
[time=2318] For a little G God on some mantle, for a myriad of other little things.
[time=2327] For an image, in the form of corruptible man,
[time=2334] and of birds, and four-footed animals, and crawling creatures, mankind has worshiped all the above for years and years and years.
[time=2343] And we still do.
[time=2345] And you may not be worshiping a little idol on your mantle.
[time=2348] I might not be worshiping a little G God on my car dashboard.
[time=2353] But we'll trade God for a condo, or we'll trade God for 20 seconds of pleasure.
[time=2364] We do it all the time.
[time=2368] All right, hang on.
[time=2372] Therefore, the use of therefore always points back to what we've just seen.
[time=2378] Therefore, God gave them over.
[time=2381] He gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity so that their bodies would be dishonored among them, for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie.
[time=2390] And in this exchanging, which really is an issue of worship, they worshiped and served the creature, rather than the creator who was blessed forever, amen, for this reason God gave them over to degrading passions.
[time=2406] Here we see the wrath of God.
[time=2410] The wrath of God takes a number of different forms.
[time=2413] I'll show you those in just a moment, but I'll just tell you here we see the wrath of God evidenced through the removal of restraint.
[time=2421] God exercised, did you know this?
[time=2424] Were you aware of this?
[time=2425] God exercises this restraint.
[time=2428] He actually puts restraints on us at times to keep us from our natural inclination.
[time=2434] There are times though when God removes this restraint
[time=2440] and the wrath of God is revealed.
[time=2442] He gave them over exchange, the truth of God for a lie.
[time=2447] Worship them, serve the creator rather than the creature, rather than the creator for this reason God, 26 gave them over to degrading passions for their women exchange, the natural function for that which is unnatural and in the same way also, the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.
[time=2477] Sound familiar?
[time=2479] It was interesting as I read that this week, we just think that this virus that so many people are infected with, we think that these millions and millions of folks who contracted that virus through illicit immoral activity outside of God's design, we think that this is a new phenomenon.
[time=2509] We think this all started in the 80s.
[time=2513] This wasn't prophecy here, this is talking about what was going on even then.
[time=2518] We see God's wrath, we see God's judgment, we see the consequences of depraved activity, even back then and in some ways, we see it manifested in some similar ways that we see it manifested today.
[time=2533] And just as they did not, verse 28, see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind.
[time=2544] Many of you in the room know what that looks like.
[time=2548] For many of us in the room, we were saved from that to do those things which are not proper, being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice,
[time=2574] they are gossip's, gossip makes it onto the list here, slanderous sins of the tongue, haters of God,
[time=2586] insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil.
[time=2590] That's where that goes as it continues to progress, we begin to invent ways to do evil, disobedient to parents, interesting, listed there on this list of immoral, evil, progressively depraved activity.
[time=2607] They are without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful, and although they know, back to verse 19, because that which is known about God is evident within them, and although verse 32, they know the ordinance of God.
[time=2622] What's the ordinance of God?
[time=2624] That those who practice such things are worthy of death, they knowing that not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice those very same things.
[time=2636] All of that, my friends, is pure, unadulterated humanness.
[time=2645] And that right there, as hard as that is to read, as hard as it is for you and I to envision, as hard as it is for you and I to live with, that's where it all ends up, left to itself.
[time=2661] Humanness ends up there.
[time=2663] Our unrighteousness leaves us guilty, it leaves us condemned and distant from God, and the only thing that has the dunomos to save us is this thing called the what, the gospel.
[time=2677] And the gospel, my friends, is what?
[time=2679] Jesus died for our sins.
[time=2682] I told you I'd tell you a little bit about the wrath of God, just quickly, if you go back to 18, I just want you to kind of hear this phrase and understand there's a number of different contexts within which we see it.
[time=2696] The wrath of God, you'll hear people say God is wrathful.
[time=2702] God is a wrathful God.
[time=2704] People will say that God is a God of judgment.
[time=2707] You'll hear folks say that God's anger burns against sin and things of that nature.
[time=2712] You need to know that that's all very true.
[time=2716] It's very true, it is very consistent with the character of our God.
[time=2722] There are some other things about our God we can talk about as well, but that is very true.
[time=2726] The scriptures do speak clearly and often about the wrath of God.
[time=2730] Just write these down quickly.
[time=2731] The scriptures talk about eternal wrath.
[time=2735] It's a place called hell, my friends, and it's not a myth, it's real.
[time=2739] The scriptures speak to eschatological, big word.
[time=2743] Remember, we're not gonna be intimidated by big words anymore.
[time=2746] It just means the end times.
[time=2748] When this whole thing kind of gets wrapped up by God's design and his plan, there is a judgment that will come.
[time=2754] Eschatological wrath.
[time=2757] See, it's not so bad.
[time=2758] Now you know what that means.
[time=2759] Cataclysmic wrath.
[time=2762] What do you call the flood?
[time=2763] Genesis six, seven, and eight.
[time=2765] When God decides to flood the earth.
[time=2767] What do you call Sodom and Gomorrah?
[time=2768] They're in Genesis 13.
[time=2770] Cataclysmic wrath.
[time=2771] There are times when God's wrath was revealed in cataclysmic ways.
[time=2776] There's consequential wrath.
[time=2778] Consequences, Goliath thought it would be a good idea to mock God.
[time=2783] There's just one example.
[time=2784] Goliath thought it, the Philistines thought it was a good idea to mock God.
[time=2789] To go against God.
[time=2790] God sends a little guy named David.
[time=2792] Boom, consequential wrath of God.
[time=2794] Goliath falls, head chopped off.
[time=2797] It's an amazing picture.
[time=2798] They should make a movie about that.
[time=2801] Well, I'll talk about that later.
[time=2803] I always thought David and Goliath would be a great movie.
[time=2806] Removal of restraint wrath.
[time=2807] We talked about that.
[time=2808] Not just at the end of time, but present active.
[time=2811] It's also very important.
[time=2815] Ms. Corbin and the team make their way up.
[time=2817] Listen, don't miss this last point here.
[time=2820] It's also very important that you understand this about the wrath of God.
[time=2824] The wrath of God isn't some subjective, divine outburst of anger by God at the end of a celestial bad day aimed at people who are annoying him.
[time=2835] That's not the wrath of God.
[time=2839] It's not how it plays out.
[time=2840] It's not what it's about.
[time=2842] No, no, no, God's wrath isn't God kicking the dog.
[time=2846] God's wrath is this.
[time=2848] Please get this.
[time=2849] The clear, determined and objective response of a pure, holy and righteous God against sin
[time=2860] against unrighteousness.
[time=2863] You see that?
[time=2865] And here's why I give that to you because again and again and again, you still think at times as I still think at times.
[time=2872] And so many people that we bump into think at times that the wrath of God isn't what?
[time=2879] Fair.
[time=2880] Don't you struggle with that sometimes?
[time=2883] Be honest.
[time=2884] Anybody wanna say yes?
[time=2885] It's fair.
[time=2890] Because a holy, pure and righteous God who is supreme in his being sovereign and overall does and chooses and responds as he will.
[time=2904] And his holy, pure response to all we just read is fair.
[time=2915] It's not unfair.
[time=2918] It's fair.
[time=2919] The doctrine of condemnation, man's need for the righteousness of God.
[time=2924] All right, guess where it is in the scriptures
[time=2930] where we see the most vivid, violent and thorough display of God's scorching, seething, all-consuming, destructive wrath.
[time=2949] Guess who got it all?
[time=2950] Jesus.
[time=2953] All of it.
[time=2956] Every bit of it on Jesus.
[time=2961] So your sin and my sin, all of our unrighteousness could be vanquished.
[time=2970] It was the person of Christ.
[time=2974] It was the cross and it was the gospel.
[time=2976] It was in this context of Calvary where all of God's wrath came at one point in time on one person.
[time=2984] And I think this morning that that's worthy of our praise.
[time=2988] So we might go a little long, but at this stage, I don't care.
[time=2993] And I want to ask all of you to stand and would you just sing from your heart this morning as Corbin and our team lead us in a response to the great saving grace and hope of the gospel.
[time=3004] (gentle music) (gentle music)
[time=3011] [MUSIC - 35 seconds]
[time=3053] See from his head.
[time=3060] [MUSIC - 176 seconds]
[time=3241] - Hey Katie, would you put the first slide up
[time=3254] from the chorus, that first stanza of the chorus from, there you go right there.
[time=3260] Hey look at that, everybody real quick.
[time=3263] Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross bids me, come and die and find that I may, remember we talked about it, truly what, live.
[time=3275] God help you, and I mean that in a really good
[time=3282] and loving way, God help you.
[time=3286] I mean and let us come alongside however we can, if you're somehow today, live in a life, and you think it's living, I mean maybe you've even said that, gosh this is living, I'm really living.
[time=3301] And you're really not, because you haven't come
[time=3308] to that place of realizing your unrighteousness, and God's provision for you of the righteousness you need, you haven't come yet to that place of bowing the knee of your heart and life, and fully surrendering, you and your heart and your life, all of you, to the great truth of the gospel.
[time=3327] And be as Corbin plays, let me just pray for you.
[time=3330] If your head's bowed and your eyes closed, God we just would ask that the great truth of the gospel, that we're sinners, that we're unrighteous, that left to ourselves, we merit only eternal separation from you, God that you could lead and guide as only you could lead and guide anybody in this room this morning who really never has believed in their heart and confessed with their mouth, as it says they're in Romans 10, that they accept the great truth of the gospel and they submit their heart and life to you.
[time=3369] God you can do that, in the heart of anybody here in this room, in the heart of anybody watching on the broadcast, God you can do that with a willing heart and I would just encourage you, whoever you are, if your heart is willing to bow and to be prone in that direction that you would articulate, not only that admittance of your need, but your commitment to follow him and the Bible says you will be what?
[time=3399] Saved.
[time=3400] Father we believe that you do that work, we believe you're doing that work, even now as we speak, in hearts and souls right here in this room and we, as we leave this morning, we leave with that great song that we just sang on our hearts, all that wonderful cross, the gift of your son who brings your righteousness to a people who desperately needed it, and thank you for that in your son's name, amen.
[time=3429] Now listen as you go, I wanna just say this, if there's anybody in the room who, as we read through Romans one and that difficult section there where the unrighteousness of man got so clearly articulated, anybody in the room thinking, oh my gosh, I'm glad that's not me, glad I never did those things, glad that's not what I was like, or glad that I'm not like that, glad I never got that ugly with me, and I would just invite you back next week.
[time=3463] 'Cause Romans two, Romans one is condemnation and the unrighteous man, Romans two is the moral man, the man who thinks he's good, and there's some really good things that you need to see and we need to be reminded of, God bless you, have a great week, we'll see you then.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
