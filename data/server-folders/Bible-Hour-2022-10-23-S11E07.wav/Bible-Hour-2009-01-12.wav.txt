[time=70] Sing it out.
[time=72] [MUSIC - 282 seconds]
[time=361] Well, welcome everybody to the Bible Hour.
[time=366] We're thankful that you've joined us again.
[time=368] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving here on the team at Blackhawk Ministries, and we are thankful for time like this to share with you the things that God is doing here at Blackhawk
[time=380] and the opportunities that not only we have, but the opportunities that we feel like you have as well,
[time=386] and I can't wait to share with you just a few of those this morning.
[time=390] I am as a dad, first of all, as a pastor and leader here at Blackhawk, we're thankful for some things.
[time=397] As a dad, as a father, I'm extremely grateful for our children's ministry here at Blackhawk,
[time=403] our middle school ministry that we call liquid, and our high school ministry we call 212.
[time=409] And I just can't tell you enough about Janice Mariezy and her children's ministry team.
[time=414] What goes on here on a Sunday morning, although there are other times that things are available,
[time=420] Sunday morning in and of itself is an enormous effort to build into the lives of our young ones,
[time=427] the truth of God's word and the love of his people.
[time=430] It's an incredible opportunity. I would encourage you, if you haven't, to come and allow your kids to be loved and cared for in a meaningful and very special way.
[time=440] Liquid is our middle school ministry, sixth, seventh, and eighth graders.
[time=445] You may have a few of those yourself. You may have some friends who have some.
[time=449] It is a team of people here at Blackhawk under the leadership of our student ministry pastor,
[time=455] Jesse Hannah, that build into the lives of our young people.
[time=459] What a critical stage of life, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade.
[time=464] So many decisions are being made. So many thoughts are being formed.
[time=468] And I love what goes on Sunday mornings, first hour at nine o'clock, over in our North Campus with our middle school students.
[time=476] They not only have a great time being together, but that staff of folks who work with them in a very intentional and purposeful way
[time=485] are building into them the truth about God so that they can live life in this culture, their culture in a way that truly makes a difference.
[time=494] And then on Wednesday nights at seven thirty, the North Campus Asylum is just absolutely packed
[time=500] with between 150 and 200 high school kids from seven, eight, nine different campuses
[time=506] all over the Fort Wayne community.
[time=508] Jesse Hannah and his team again on Wednesday nights are doing a phenomenal job of helping the truth of God's Word become more and more relevant and real to 15, 16, 17, 18 year olds,
[time=520] kids who need to understand how real and how true his truth is.
[time=525] The difference it can make in their lives as they face temptations and challenges
[time=532] that you and I as kids never even came close to facing.
[time=535] I'm so grateful for what goes on and I just want you to be aware.
[time=538] Maybe you're not a part of a local church, maybe the Bible hour is kind of church for you,
[time=544] but maybe you've got kids who could use that kind of help and support.
[time=548] Maybe you and your parenting could use that kind of help and support.
[time=551] We'd love to provide that for you come and check it out.
[time=554] You can find out more about all three ministries on our website.
[time=557] I hope you'll visit and learn more about it.
[time=560] Thank you so much for tuning in today.
[time=562] We're thankful that you're here and can't wait to see you soon.
[time=566] Come by and see us some Sunday morning at nine or ten forty five.
[time=570] God bless you. Have a great week.
[time=572] You are the source of life I can't be left behind.
[time=585] No one else will do.
[time=591] I will take hold of you.
[time=598] 'Cause I need you Jesus to come to my rescue.
[time=605] Where else can I go?
[time=610] There's no other name by which I am saved.
[time=618] Can't show me with grace I will follow you.
[time=638] My heart is yours, for life I need your hand.
[time=649] In my, no one else will do.
[time=657] I put my trust in you.
[time=664] 'Cause I need you Jesus to come to my rescue.
[time=672] Where else can I go?
[time=677] There's no other name by which I am saved.
[time=685] Can't show me with grace I need you Jesus to come to my rescue.
[time=697] Where else can I go?
[time=702] There's no other name by which I am saved.
[time=710] Can't show me with grace I will follow you.
[time=718] I will follow you, I will follow you.
[time=723] I will follow you more, forever.
[time=730] This world has nothing for me.
[time=740] I will put my trust in you.
[time=744] This world has nothing for me.
[time=747] I'll put my trust in God alone.
[time=749] This world has nothing for me.
[time=753] 'Cause I need you.
[time=755] I need you Lord.
[time=760] Where else can I go?
[time=763] I need you Lord.
[time=789] Where else can I go?
[time=790] There's no other name by which I am saved.
[time=799] Capture me with grace.
[time=806] I need you Jesus.
[time=809] Come to my rescue.
[time=812] Where else can I go?
[time=818] There's no other name by which I am saved.
[time=826] Capture me with grace.
[time=848] I will follow you.
[time=856] I'm gonna follow you.
[time=859] I will follow you.
[time=862] Lord, I trust you God.
[time=866] I will follow you.
[time=891] I want you to thank Corbin and the team.
[time=896] You know that last phrase that Ben just sang.
[time=906] I will follow you.
[time=907] That's what in our study of the scriptures in the last couple of years really.
[time=912] My own study and in our discussion around here at Blackhawk these days we've realized that those especially in that first church who were rescued by him.
[time=922] Those that met Jesus and those whose lives were transformed and changed.
[time=928] They having been rescued.
[time=930] Those individuals having been saved they followed him.
[time=935] They were called what?
[time=937] Disciples.
[time=938] They were those who followed after his teaching.
[time=944] They modeled their lives after that which he said and did.
[time=949] And their church, that first church did the very same thing.
[time=953] And so we are so grateful for the example that they've left us and have been endeavoring in recent days here in this most recent season of ministry at Blackhawk to try to not only talk about that but model that and help every one of you that knows him to embrace that very picture.
[time=972] They gathered as a church.
[time=975] They gathered as a body of believers.
[time=977] They connected in smaller settings and I'll tell you what, they were a people who were in no way at all willing to sit tight.
[time=984] Stay put.
[time=985] Be comfortable.
[time=986] They went.
[time=987] They were a going group of people and I have it on the screen for you this morning.
[time=992] I want to just remind you every once in a while it's just good to be reminded.
[time=995] This isn't something we just came up with.
[time=998] It's not three words and three statements that just kind of sounded nice.
[time=1003] It is the very model that we find in scripture of that very first church.
[time=1007] And it's something I want to ask you again and again and again.
[time=1010] Are you engaged in?
[time=1012] You personally.
[time=1014] Are you engaged in these three endeavors?
[time=1017] We're doing our best to provide you opportunities to do so.
[time=1020] And I hope you can answer yes.
[time=1022] Are you gathering with us on a regular basis?
[time=1025] Has this become a priority for you?
[time=1027] Is this something that you say yes to, week after week after week?
[time=1031] Not because good people do.
[time=1034] But because disciples like you and me desperately need this time together.
[time=1039] Are you connecting in smaller settings as meaningful as this room is and the time that we share in it?
[time=1044] Are you giving yourself to smaller settings?
[time=1048] Being led by those who help us shepherd here at Blackhawk inside these walls on a Sunday morning in a smaller setting
[time=1055] outside these walls during the week.
[time=1058] There are opportunities for you tonight.
[time=1060] For instance, 6 p.m. you've heard us talk about it.
[time=1063] I hope you'll come.
[time=1064] I hope if you're looking for a place to connect some people to meet some relationships that could be established
[time=1070] and a great opportunity with Steve Webster to make your way through the Book of Mark.
[time=1075] That'll begin tonight at six upstairs in the junior high high school wing over here upstairs in 257-259.
[time=1083] It's been a great opportunity for any of you.
[time=1086] Students, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, anybody is welcome to come and find encouragement.
[time=1095] We gather to encounter our God through the Scriptures and through our worship.
[time=1099] We connect in smaller settings to engage in growth and in those settings you will grow.
[time=1105] Your faith will be stretched.
[time=1107] Your understanding of Him and His truth will be deepened.
[time=1110] And then we go. You heard the announcement this morning, Jeff Hardless meeting with anybody in the family here willing to go and learn more about short-term opportunities here and abroad.
[time=1121] And I hope you'll take us up on that.
[time=1123] I hope you'll go and sit with Jeff.
[time=1124] I hope you'll get the material and think about going somewhere with us in the days to come.
[time=1130] But be reminded this morning that while we're putting some structure to going, and that's a good thing,
[time=1136] these trips that we'll take and the opportunity it presents for you to go.
[time=1140] I hope you'll be mindful of that.
[time=1142] But don't forget today when you get home you may have an opportunity to go across the room to help pick up some dishes,
[time=1149] across the street to help maybe shovel some snow.
[time=1152] Remember, we're going.
[time=1154] We're going when we go to work and serve.
[time=1156] We're going when we come alongside those in need in our family.
[time=1160] That's what disciples do, my friends.
[time=1162] They gather, connect, and go, and our hope is that you'll continue to do so.
[time=1168] Well, if you brought your Bibles this morning, open them up.
[time=1170] We're just to Romans chapter 2.
[time=1172] We come this morning to the second chapter of Romans in our study of biblical doctrine
[time=1178] and our ongoing look at our very first doctrine that we've tackled, the doctrine, my friends, of condemnation.
[time=1187] The doctrine of condemnation, or better said, man's need, man's desperate need,
[time=1193] as we noted last week, for the righteousness of God.
[time=1197] Having demonstrated and having communicated the sinfulness and the darkness and the depravity of the immoral man, if you will, of chapter 1,
[time=1209] the apostle Paul now turns his attention in chapter 2 to the man that we'll call for the purpose of our discussion this morning, the moral man.
[time=1219] We've seen the immoral man of chapter 1.
[time=1221] We come now to the moral man of chapter 2 and it's a great place in our discussion to just stop.
[time=1228] And for the purpose of our study and our look at this chapter this morning, ask the question, who is the moral man?
[time=1238] Got a pretty decent look at who the immoral man was last week.
[time=1243] Who's the moral man?
[time=1248] There may be some thoughts that come to your mind.
[time=1250] Here's a few you can write down.
[time=1252] My friends, the moral man is the man who sees himself as good.
[time=1256] The moral man is the good man.
[time=1259] The moral man is the one who keeps all the rules.
[time=1262] Know anybody like that?
[time=1263] Got anybody like that in your family?
[time=1265] Rule keepers.
[time=1267] The moral man is the good man.
[time=1268] The moral man is the rule keeper.
[time=1270] The moral man is the man who pays his taxes and takes good care of his family.
[time=1275] The moral woman is the gal that makes lunches for her kids and drives them to school and smiles as she waves and helps with charitable organizations.
[time=1284] And certainly, the moral man never commits murder.
[time=1290] The moral man never commits adultery or homosexuality or any of the heinous sins listed at the end of chapter one last week, for you see the moral man is an upstanding man.
[time=1300] The moral man is a respectable man in his eyes or hers,
[time=1308] and very likely in the eyes of others.
[time=1314] We had the contrast of this last week.
[time=1317] You can just turn back over to one.
[time=1320] Twenty-nine being filled with all unrighteousness and wickedness and greed
[time=1327] and evil full of envy and murder and strife, deceit and malice.
[time=1332] They are gossips and slanderers and haters of God-insulin, arrogant, boastful inventors of evil, disobedient to parents without understanding untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful.
[time=1348] That's the immoral man, and now we come this morning to the good man.
[time=1353] The moral man, if you ask him or her, the moral man really does understand
[time=1359] the need for divine condemnation in a sense.
[time=1363] He sees clearly the need for God's righteousness to be delivered to sinful mankind.
[time=1369] He says that he doesn't see it being needed in his own life, just not to him.
[time=1374] He doesn't think he needs it because in his mind and in his heart he's not as bad as who.
[time=1381] Chapter two guy is not as bad as chapter one, chapter one guy.
[time=1389] And really just a sidebar here.
[time=1391] I know from my own experience, many of you may resonate with this.
[time=1396] Moral people leave us feeling.
[time=1401] Moral people tend to leave us feeling like we just don't match up.
[time=1407] They kind of have a way, and sometimes it's kind of overt and rude, and sometimes it's kind of subtle and not so overt.
[time=1414] But nonetheless, the moral man has a way of making you and I feel like he or she
[time=1420] is just a little bit better than us because they continue to be in their hearts and minds, so fixated on what you or I do and what they don't.
[time=1434] Read with me if you would, chapter two, verse one.
[time=1436] Therefore, again, I'll remind you wherever you see therefore in Scripture it refers
[time=1442] to the section or the passage of Scripture that we've just encountered.
[time=1447] So in this case, therefore, in chapter two, verse one takes us back to all that we saw last week, so in light of all of that, you, he says, therefore you have no excuse.
[time=1462] Every one of you who passes judgment, and I want you to stop right there.
[time=1469] Every one of you, he says you.
[time=1471] Having just talked about the immoral man of chapter one, now he begins to, and you can sense it as he writes, now he begins to address a new audience, and he says to this new audience, you.
[time=1483] He says, you.
[time=1486] Every one of you who passes judgment, who's the audience of chapter two?
[time=1491] Well, you can get a sense for who the audience is, but let me take you to two-17.
[time=1496] You can see in two-17 we skip ahead to verse 17 just to answer that question.
[time=1502] There you see in two-17, but if you, there it is again, but if you bear the name what?
[time=1508] Say it out loud.
[time=1510] Jew, there you have it.
[time=1511] But if you bear the name Jew and rely upon the what?
[time=1515] The law.
[time=1516] The main audience in chapter two, my friends, is unbelieving.
[time=1520] It's important that you note that.
[time=1522] Unbelieving Jews.
[time=1523] The main audience in chapter one was the, was the immoral unbeliever.
[time=1528] The individual who had suppressed the truth in righteousness.
[time=1531] God had made it evident to them.
[time=1533] They had suppressed it.
[time=1535] They had exchanged the glory of a incorruptible God.
[time=1539] These are people who were unbelievers.
[time=1541] They had not yet repented.
[time=1543] They had not come to faith in Christ.
[time=1545] They were immoral and unbelieving.
[time=1548] And here we come to chapter two.
[time=1550] And for the most part, it's safe to say the audience here would be unbelieving Jews.
[time=1555] Let me just say this to you.
[time=1557] In general, it's anyone claiming morality.
[time=1562] Anybody claiming that the way they're going to get through this thing in the end is by their moral good behavior.
[time=1569] This would be Jew or Gentile in that sense.
[time=1572] Unreligious or religious.
[time=1574] Proud, basically arrogant, rule keeping people who actually think they're exempt from the Romans 118 wrath of God because they're not as sinful as them.
[time=1590] Those who engage in the really sinful stuff.
[time=1598] Well look what it says there in chapter two.
[time=1601] Those of you who pass judgment for in that which you judge another.
[time=1607] Paul says you condemn yourself for you who judge for you chapter two moral man who look back at chapter one immoral man and judge them.
[time=1619] You condemn yourself for you who judge practice the same things.
[time=1625] And we know that the judgment of God, the wrath of God rightly falls.
[time=1631] There's that phrase "rightly falls".
[time=1633] We talked about this last week.
[time=1634] The wrath of God is not unfair.
[time=1636] It is what?
[time=1637] It's fair.
[time=1639] And it rightly falls.
[time=1642] It rightly descends upon those who practice such things.
[time=1647] But do you, I love this verse three, but do you suppose this oh man?
[time=1652] When you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same yourself that you will escape the judgment of God.
[time=1663] A couple of very important things to take note of here in just these first three verses.
[time=1668] If I were going to kind of just ballpark it for you or give you some big bullet points it would be self righteousness and hypocrisy.
[time=1678] Self righteousness and hypocrisy is what Paul warns against.
[time=1683] Let's just kind of make our way through that.
[time=1685] Paul says here in essence that their attitude, their attitude of judgment and condemnation of others as they choose to excuse, ignore and look past their own sin
[time=1697] and iniquity is a problem.
[time=1699] Their own unrighteousness is a problem.
[time=1703] I think this is a huge and growing difficulty in the church today.
[time=1708] Self righteousness.
[time=1710] If you want to write this down you can self righteous behavior.
[time=1714] People is people who takes place when people who possess an exercise a critical and judgmental mindset.
[time=1722] Self righteous behavior takes place when people who possess an exercise a critical and judgmental mindset towards the actions or attitudes of others.
[time=1736] People so quick and ready to point an accusing finger and so unwilling, so willing to point an accusing finger and so unwilling to assess and deal with their own faults and failures first.
[time=1751] And this is self righteous behavior.
[time=1755] Why does this happen?
[time=1757] How is it that so many of us in this room can at times fall into this thinking, fall into this mindset?
[time=1765] How is it that so many of us in this room this morning can at times fall under the banner of the moral man who looks back at chapter 1 and says oh my goodness.
[time=1777] Look at them. Shame on them.
[time=1781] Whoa on them.
[time=1785] Well there's some things that take place.
[time=1788] That's just a brief side bar.
[time=1790] Let me just give you two. What leads?
[time=1792] What is it that leads you and I to a self righteous mindset?
[time=1796] You've got to be careful of these things my friends.
[time=1799] Number one, minimizing God's standard.
[time=1802] You could say altering God's standard as well.
[time=1805] The moral man is prone to self righteousness in that the moral man is prone to minimizing God's standards.
[time=1814] Here's how this works.
[time=1816] God in his word, my friends, one of the great, great comforts and one of the great encouragements of the scriptures is that God through his scripture speaks to you and to me.
[time=1826] In God's word you and I find direction for living.
[time=1836] In God's word you and I find those things that he longs for us to do and engage in and be a part of and while there are a number of things he tells us that he longs for us to do and practice there are of course then those things he longs for us not to.
[time=1846] And in God's word he establishes a standard for you and I to understand and live toward.
[time=1857] Here's what we do sometimes.
[time=1858] Take Ephesians 4-29, just going to give you some examples here.
[time=1861] Ephesians 4-29, just write that down.
[time=1864] Ephesians 4-29, here's an example of God establishing a standard.
[time=1871] And the standard of Ephesians 4-29 is you can read it there yourself.
[time=1875] He says let know everybody say the word.
[time=1878] Unwholesome.
[time=1880] God's word there says let know unwholesome word, right?
[time=1886] Proceed from your mouth.
[time=1888] And so what happens is the self-righteous moral man comes along and defines for God dangerous thing to do.
[time=1898] Defines for God that what that means is that's talking about cussing.
[time=1904] That's talking about swearing, that's talking about vulgar speech.
[time=1909] That's talking about a certain list of words that I don't say, that good people don't say, that God honoring people don't say.
[time=1918] See the moral man comes and attaches his own definition to that and wants to make a huge deal about those over here who say those things.
[time=1927] And talk that way and they want to make an equally huge deal about the fact that they don't.
[time=1935] They don't say those things but somehow in their definition they've left out their own garden variety gossip.
[time=1945] They leave out the private secret critical demeaning dismantling talk that goes on between them and a friend on a phone about somebody else that nobody ever hears about.
[time=1960] So the moral man wants to make a very big deal about the outward and physical violation while somehow ignoring or passing over their own fault and absolute violation of the very standard that God established.
[time=1978] God establishes a standard, God says don't engage in sex outside of marriage.
[time=1987] Before you're married, while you're married, don't do it.
[time=1993] Don't engage in sexual activity outside of marriage and so the moral man comes along and what do you think the moral man focuses on?
[time=2000] The moral man focuses on the act. The moral man focuses on the very act of not doing it and takes great pride in the fact that he or she is a moral man or woman would never do that and shame on all you folks over here in chapter one who do it and invent new ways to do it.
[time=2022] But the moral man, while focusing on not doing it, then we've got to ask the moral man about the websites that get visited and the books that she's reading and the shows that get watched and the music that gets listened to that floods their minds and their hearts with immoral thoughts
[time=2046] and they're so quick, I'm so quick, I won't just put all this on you, I'm so quick at times in that mode to want to make such a huge difference between what goes on in my mind and what I actually do or don't do.
[time=2064] And there is this self-righteous seed in there that takes root and begins to grow.
[time=2072] On that note, I mean just to remind you, I don't, many of you in the room are very familiar with this, I don't know how all of you view this, some of you might think it was just kind of a little mental game he was playing, I don't think it was.
[time=2085] I remember Jesus' words, put it up on the screen there Katie, in Matthew 5, you have heard that it was said you shall not commit what, adultery.
[time=2096] And then most of you know what it says after that, but I say to you that everyone who what, everyone of you who looks, every one of you who in your looking lusts, every one of you who in your looking desires, every one of you who in your looking
[time=2114] mindfulness of that steps outside up here of the prescribed will of God, he says you've committed what, adultery.
[time=2126] You ask me, you say, do you think he really means that? I do.
[time=2133] I think he really means that. I think that is a solemn and very serious warning and admonition.
[time=2142] And I think it's a very clear obliteration of this distinction that the moral man or woman often wants to make between what happens in private or what happens mentally and what happens outwardly and physically and blatantly.
[time=2159] And I think it's something for you and I to consider. God established as a standard in our self-righteousness we want to minimize or alter that standard. God says don't steal.
[time=2169] Raise your hand if you agree with that.
[time=2172] All right, God says in his word do not steal. And so the moral man comes along and minimizes that or alters that.
[time=2178] The moral man comes along and says that's robbing a bank.
[time=2182] That's like taking cash from somebody's drawer.
[time=2186] I don't do that. I'm a good man.
[time=2190] But he puts more hours on his time card than he should.
[time=2196] And he takes things from the office that aren't really his.
[time=2200] You see what I'm saying?
[time=2202] Something for all of us to consider. Self-righteousness, just a few steps away if we begin to minimize or alter God's standard.
[time=2210] The second thing is we minimize the severity of our own sin.
[time=2215] We forget that any, let me say that again, any sin.
[time=2220] We forget so many times that any sin is an absolute and extreme and serious violation of not only God's law but of God himself and our relationship with him.
[time=2234] We forget that any sin is a violation of that.
[time=2239] And we also, again, we just remain in our moralistic mindset.
[time=2244] We remain consumed and fixated on the activities and actions of who, others.
[time=2253] I love Jesus' words. Matthew 7. You can turn there.
[time=2257] Matthew 7 says there in the first, just in those first few verses,
[time=2265] almost sounds like Paul writing as you pick up the dialogue there.
[time=2270] "Do not judge," Jesus says. "Do not judge." Moral man, moral woman, listen, the Lord Jesus himself says to you, "Do not judge so that you will not be what?
[time=2284] For in the way you judge, you will be judged," he says.
[time=2290] And by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.
[time=2295] And he says, "Why? Why do you, moral man, moral woman?
[time=2300] Why do you look at the spec that is in your brother's eye but do not notice the what?
[time=2307] The log, the beam.
[time=2310] I love our Lord's sense of humor. I love his directness.
[time=2315] I love the pictures he painted with his word. What a picture.
[time=2320] I mean, aren't you just, I mean, along with me, just pinned to the wall on that one?
[time=2326] Why are you so consumed with the spec in your brother's eye but do not notice the log,
[time=2334] the beam that is in your own eye?
[time=2339] I love what it says on in verse 5, "You hypocrite. You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye
[time=2345] and then you will see clearly to take the spec out of your brother's eye."
[time=2351] There's a really important word tucked in there, just a real short word.
[time=2354] You might read through it pretty quick but I want to draw your attention to it.
[time=2358] If you hypocrite, then what's the next word? Say it louder, first.
[time=2367] First things first in this whole deal.
[time=2371] First deal with who? Yeah, first deal with you.
[time=2378] First be willing to morning, noon and night.
[time=2383] First of all, be willing consistently, day in and day out, be an individual, be a follower of Christ
[time=2390] who first and foremost isn't consumed with pointing the accusing finger at the attitude or actions of others
[time=2398] but instead be one who is willing to consider and understand the personal violations that are taking place
[time=2405] every day in the outward reality or inward reality of your own heart and life.
[time=2412] First, he says, very first thing you do is take care of the log that's in your own eye.
[time=2417] Paul is warning back to Romans 2. Paul is warning the moral man.
[time=2422] He's saying, "Don't exaggerate or focus on the faults of others while making light of your own iniquity."
[time=2434] Take the log out.
[time=2438] Look at Romans 2.3, let's go back. A couple of things I want to make note of here.
[time=2448] But do you suppose, watch this, but do you suppose this, oh man, when you, moral man of chapter 2,
[time=2455] pass judgment on the immoral man of chapter 1, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things
[time=2462] and do the same yourself that you will escape the judgment or wrath of God.
[time=2472] I want to make sure everybody in the room understands this.
[time=2475] For some of you, it may not be confusing for others of you, it might be, and it's okay if it is.
[time=2480] Because here's the deal. We just spent an entire week, last week, talking about the immoral man of chapter 1.
[time=2485] I read the list to you already this morning, and those were the things that the immoral man practices,
[time=2492] the unbelieving man far from God, left to himself.
[time=2495] And now we come, I've even said it, we come to a new audience.
[time=2499] We come to a new audience, the unbelieving Jew or just the moralistic person who somehow thinks he or she's going to skate through this thing because they're so good and right.
[time=2508] And Paul says to this new audience, how do you do this?
[time=2513] How do you pass judgment on them, this separate group of people who are doing a different set of things?
[time=2521] How do you stand in judgment of them new audience with your own list of things?
[time=2527] But wait a minute, he says their list of things are the same things.
[time=2533] So what is that?
[time=2537] When you do the same things, and let me just try my best to quickly just clarify that for you.
[time=2546] The same things, he's not so much with this new audience who really is bent toward a new list.
[time=2553] He's not so much saying that they actually are pulling one over on us and secretly engaged in all these heinous, dirty, rotten, immoral things.
[time=2563] What he's saying is this, their sin is the same thing.
[time=2573] And their sin is the same thing because all sin is the same.
[time=2582] Just as seedy and just as dark and just as divisive and just as offensive to a holy God.
[time=2592] And so while we're consumed over here, us chapter two folks and somehow trying to look good and seem right, the sinfulness in us still separates us from God.
[time=2604] It's just as awful, it's just as dirty, it's just as worthy of condemnation.
[time=2612] Doctrine of condemnation, chapters one and two, man's need, man's desperate need, the immoral man and the moral man.
[time=2621] Man's need for the righteousness of God.
[time=2624] Go back to verse 18, it fits now.
[time=2627] See how this all flows together?
[time=2628] Verse 18, chapter one, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness."
[time=2638] It's all of it, the immoral man's unrighteousness and the moral man's unrighteousness.
[time=2647] Chapter two verses one to three are really a warning.
[time=2650] Paul is saying to the moral, good man, wake up.
[time=2654] Paul is saying to the moral and good man of chapter two, do not kid yourself.
[time=2659] This isn't some comparative external game we're playing, this judgment thing, this wrath of God thing, isn't about who looks better.
[time=2672] Got to say that one more time.
[time=2674] This isn't about who looks better.
[time=2678] This isn't about who can hide it better.
[time=2682] This is about the condition of your what?
[time=2685] Of your heart.
[time=2688] And God knows that and God sees that and you evidence that no matter who you are, how you function, how you operate.
[time=2701] He goes on.
[time=2702] Look at verse four and five, this gets so interesting.
[time=2706] It's so to the point of love just looking at it these last several days.
[time=2711] Or do you, he goes on with the moral man.
[time=2713] Why do you do this? How do you judge them and somehow think that he's not going to see you in what you do?
[time=2720] Or maybe it's this, he says.
[time=2722] Or do you think lightly of the riches of his kindness and tolerance and patience, three great words there.
[time=2730] Or do you think lightly of the riches, the depths, the benefit of his kindness and his tolerance and his patience,
[time=2739] not knowing that the kindness of God, interesting in chapter one, we learned about the wrath of God.
[time=2746] Now in chapter two, he begins to introduce us to the kindness of God.
[time=2754] Not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to what?
[time=2758] Repentance, but because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart,
[time=2767] you, moral man, good man, tax paying man, upstanding and respectable man who looks good on the outside,
[time=2775] you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous because it's fair,
[time=2784] the righteous judgment of God.
[time=2787] Let me just give you some help on a few of these words and phrases.
[time=2790] Get your pen out, write this stuff down.
[time=2792] I think it's going to be really helpful for you as you think this through.
[time=2795] To think lightly of, can you write that down?
[time=2799] Or do you, he says in verse four, or do you think lightly of?
[time=2803] It's to underestimate and even look down on someone's or something's value.
[time=2810] To be dismissive, to dismiss it.
[time=2813] To look something or someone in the eye who they themselves or what they're offering has great value.
[time=2821] And it's just simply to miss it, to underestimate it completely and blow right past it, to think lightly of the kindness.
[time=2829] Let's keep going.
[time=2830] Or do you think lightly of the riches of his kindness?
[time=2833] This word means the benefits and blessings that God gives to undeserving people, and they are many.
[time=2841] The benefits and blessings that God gives to you and to me.
[time=2845] Do you think lightly of the riches of his kindness and his tolerance?
[time=2851] There's another word for you, the Greek word for tolerance means to hold back.
[time=2857] What do you mean by that, Kelly? Well, here's what I mean.
[time=2860] And this might be, again, new truth for some.
[time=2862] It may be a reminder for others, but this is a truth that we need to understand and take hold of.
[time=2867] Do you know that this is how God works rather than destroying every person on the face of the earth.
[time=2877] The moment he or she sends, which is what his holiness and his righteousness and his perfection should and would be able to do.
[time=2888] In light of the sinfulness and the unrighteousness of man, if all that were just to play out the way it should.
[time=2896] He would destroy every person the moment he or she sends.
[time=2901] Instead of that, God is constantly holding back, exercising Greek word tolerance, holding back his judgment.
[time=2910] God has continuously, one author said it this way.
[time=2913] God is continuously protecting, sending people in a physical and temporary way from what they deserve in order to show them his saving character.
[time=2925] So that they might come to him, admit their sin, accept the gospel, the dunamos of salvation, and be saved.
[time=2937] Kindness, tolerance, patience.
[time=2944] Write that word, patience down, underline it.
[time=2947] This word indicates, very important concept here, this word indicates the duration of time for which God chooses.
[time=2954] Not you, you don't get to choose how long he's patient.
[time=2961] You understand that, right?
[time=2964] This is the duration of time for which God chooses to exercise the above-mentioned qualities.
[time=2973] It's kindness and his tolerance, his kindness and his tolerance are there.
[time=2978] But my friend, whoever you are in this room, if you're watching the broadcast, if you're listening online, whoever you are, and you've not bowled the knee of your heart to him, you've not fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=2996] He exercises with you here in this passage, and he evidences to you this kindness and this tolerance and this patience, the doctrinal term, and this is a study on doctrine.
[time=3010] So again, we're not shying away from doctrinal terms.
[time=3013] I want you to write this down.
[time=3014] Those three terms comprise a very important doctrinal term known as the common grace.
[time=3020] Write that down, the common grace of God.
[time=3023] Common grace is the common everyday posture of God toward man.
[time=3028] Kindness and tolerance and patience for, listen, for a time.
[time=3035] But just for a time.
[time=3037] Then comes Hebrews 9.
[time=3039] Then comes judgment.
[time=3042] There will be a day.
[time=3045] And I would beg you.
[time=3047] I would plead with you.
[time=3048] I would invite you this morning.
[time=3051] As you open your heart and your life more and more to the life-changing eternity-altering truth about God and what he did for you and what he longs for with you, a relationship through his son.
[time=3066] I would beg you to consider that.
[time=3067] I would beg you to walk toward that.
[time=3069] I would beg you to not think lightly of his kindness and his tolerance and his patience.
[time=3075] I was 16 years old, I've told this story before, maybe a few years ago.
[time=3081] Some of you might remember, others of you might not.
[time=3083] But I was 16 years old and found myself with 14 other 16 year old boys and girls.
[time=3090] It was a combo trip, which is honestly why I went.
[time=3095] What they did was they took us on a 14 day survival expedition.
[time=3099] It was literally rock climbing, mountain climbing, glacier climbing.
[time=3104] It was up in a place called the Trinity Alps up in Northern California.
[time=3109] Beautiful country.
[time=3110] Huge, huge mountains.
[time=3112] Unbelievable setting.
[time=3113] 14 days they took us out to teach us how to do all this stuff and how to survive.
[time=3118] It was a little rough.
[time=3119] Really pushed us.
[time=3121] We got through the 14 days last day, or excuse me, the night before the last day.
[time=3127] They call me into this tent and tell me that they decided after 13 days that I'm a leader.
[time=3134] And that I'm the one they are going to entrust the next days, the final days expedition to.
[time=3141] They tell me that night in the tent that tomorrow there will be about a 9,000 foot climb that will take about anywhere from it.
[time=3148] It will take the entire day.
[time=3149] They're a little worried about the time frame, hours and hours, nine, ten hours.
[time=3153] It's going to be an enormous push to get to the top of this peak.
[time=3158] And they have there in the tent with me the maps and the guides and all the instruments
[time=3164] and the things I'm going to need to know to figure this thing out to lead this team.
[time=3167] And you know what?
[time=3168] I'm not remotely interested in what they were saying because that night we had planned to play Capture the Flag.
[time=3174] And I was as committed to fun at the age of 16 as I am at the age of 45.
[time=3179] And I could care less about their compasses and their maps.
[time=3183] I'm like, hey, dude, where's the mountain?
[time=3185] Okay, thanks.
[time=3186] I'll see you on the other side.
[time=3188] Well, they told me.
[time=3189] They said, look, you really need to listen.
[time=3191] And I just didn't.
[time=3192] And they said when you get to the top of this peak and timing is going to be essential because of the duration of time it will have taken you to get there.
[time=3200] When you get to the top, when you literally climb over the peak, it'll be what they call a fade.
[time=3207] The back side of the mountain is a fade.
[time=3209] Literally, you can just walk down.
[time=3211] It's going to be like almost straight up going up.
[time=3213] On the back side, you're going to be able to walk down to the cabin two miles.
[time=3218] We'll meet you there.
[time=3219] Whole thing's going to be over.
[time=3220] I'm like, hey, no big deal.
[time=3221] Thanks for all the help.
[time=3223] And I thought lightly of their kindness and spent almost ten hours the next day doing
[time=3236] a stellar job of leading this team up the wrong mountain.
[time=3242] No kidding.
[time=3244] We spent an entire day climbing the wrong mountain.
[time=3249] And we all get to the top.
[time=3251] And I keep telling them they're crying and they're moaning and they're panicked.
[time=3254] And they're saying, well, what's going to go?
[time=3256] Look, the peaks right there, we're going to get on top of this peak go over.
[time=3258] They're going to walk down the back side, cabin, food, fire, the whole thing.
[time=3261] Just relax.
[time=3262] We get to the top and we look over.
[time=3265] And it's literally about 5,000 feet straight down.
[time=3268] And we all in unison kind of look over to our right.
[time=3271] Oh, there's the mountain right there.
[time=3273] It's that mountain.
[time=3274] And there's the slow fade.
[time=3275] Oh, there's the cabin and the smoke step coming out of chimney.
[time=3278] And it was really bad.
[time=3280] And they had to come and rescue us off this mountain.
[time=3284] And it's never a good thing.
[time=3288] Never a good thing to think lightly of someone who's trying to give you help.
[time=3294] And guidance and direction.
[time=3297] And Paul says to you, moral man, what are you doing?
[time=3301] Wait a minute.
[time=3303] Are you thinking lightly?
[time=3306] Are you taking for granted this help that I'm giving that God's offering?
[time=3315] They are.
[time=3316] That's what moral men do.
[time=3318] They look down.
[time=3319] They're dismissive of that because they're so consumed with how they look.
[time=3323] And how good they are.
[time=3325] And he says, but because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you know, we'll rescue you off the mountain.
[time=3333] Because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart.
[time=3336] No, you're storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.
[time=3344] As Corbin and the team come up, let me just read this to you.
[time=3347] Listen closely, so having shown in chapter 2 verses 1 to 16, and we didn't get all the way to 16,
[time=3355] as you read through verse 16, you see he's reiterating this same point.
[time=3360] Having shown in 2, 1 to 16 that outwardly, listen, that outwardly moral people, Jew and Gentile alike, will stand one day condemned by God's judgment.
[time=3373] Having shown them that in 2, 1 to 16, Paul now turns his warning specifically to the Jews in verses 17 to 29.
[time=3384] And I want you to read this tonight before you go to bed.
[time=3387] I want you to sit down on your own or with some friends or with, you know, your older kids and actually look at this.
[time=3393] Because in verses 17 to 29, he kind of brings this kind of lasered focus to a group of people who have ever,
[time=3401] there was a moral group of people, it was the nation of what?
[time=3406] The nation of Israel and the people known as the Jews who were so consumed with this law and all their do's and don'ts,
[time=3412] they were captivated by this idea of how they would look.
[time=3416] And so he lets them know three things, that their heritage, that their knowledge and that their ceremonies,
[time=3425] specifically here in this passage, circumcision, will not save them.
[time=3431] And I want you to read tonight, 17 to 29.
[time=3435] And I want you to see what Paul says there, 17 to 29, again, so very clearly stating that their outward appearance,
[time=3445] that the circumcision, if you will externally, is nothing compared to the circumcision of their heart that God longs for.
[time=3454] Read through that and be reminded of what's in store for the moral man.
[time=3460] Chapter one, immoral man is in trouble.
[time=3468] Chapter three, come back next week.
[time=3470] We'll see who else is in trouble.
[time=3472] And more than who's in trouble, we'll get to see God's redemptive, redeeming plan.
[time=3477] We get to see the gospel beginning to get lived out as God brings his rescuing salvation.
[time=3484] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
