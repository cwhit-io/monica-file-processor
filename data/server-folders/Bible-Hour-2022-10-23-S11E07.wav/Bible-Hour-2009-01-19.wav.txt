[time=244] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=247] We're thankful that you've tuned into the Bible hour.
[time=250] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Blackhawk Ministries and we're thankful that we get this opportunity with you each and every week.
[time=259] I want to take just a moment if I can this week and we'd like to pay tribute to a very good friend of ours, Ed Richard.
[time=267] Ed is a part of our team here at Blackhawk Ed and Marsha and their family have been a part of this Blackhawk family for years and years and Ed has served for over 20 years giving specific leadership and involvement to the Bible hour broadcast.
[time=283] If you've watched the Bible hour over the last couple of years or if you've watched the Bible hour for the last 20, you have Ed Richard to thank for his faithful and diligent service.
[time=294] Ed is not only a valuable part of this team but anybody who knows Ed knows that he's a valuable part of our lives.
[time=302] His faithfulness and his integrity, the character with which he not only does his job but lives his life has been an inspiration and an encouragement for everybody that's ever worked with or known Ed.
[time=316] This past week, Ed lost his father, Robert Richard, otherwise known as Bob, Ed's dad, passed away this last week and Ed is out there right now actually in California spending time with the family and we wanted to just say this to all of you who watch.
[time=334] We love Ed and we're thankful for the faithfulness that he's given this endeavor.
[time=339] We want you to pray for him and Marsha and Ed's brothers and sisters and his mom out in California.
[time=345] We really do.
[time=346] We'd love for you to pray for him, to pray that God would give him grace and strength in the days to come.
[time=352] Ed's dad though most of us here didn't know him well, we knew Ed and we could tell from what we've seen in Ed all of these years that his dad must have been a very, very special man.
[time=364] We're thankful for the investment that Ed's dad made in him and our prayer is that in these coming days and weeks and months that God would be so very real as he brings comfort and hope to the Richard family.
[time=377] You might wanna drop Ed a note here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=380] You may wanna email him on our website.
[time=383] We're thankful for Ed and praying that God would give him great strength and courage in the days to come.

[time=401] [MUSIC - 135 seconds]
[time=544] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=575] (upbeat music) - Just think about how he is these things to you right now
[time=591] in this moment, your defender, your healer, your savior.
[time=596] [MUSIC - 54 seconds]
[time=662] (upbeat music) - Well, hey, if you got your Bibles this morning,
[time=679] why don't you open 'em up to Romans chapter three.
[time=682] Romans chapter three, and join me, which is we jump back into this discussion, this study that we've had the privilege of engaging in disciples and their need for doctrine.
[time=696] Why disciples need doctrine, a study from the book of Romans, and this morning I wanna start out our time by simply re-addressing just one thought, one question, one statement that we've actually made in recent weeks.
[time=707] Why study doctrine?
[time=712] Why would we be doing this?
[time=713] What is it that is so important that compels us to wanna give week after week after week to this study of what is for so many people, if you just ask them, intimidating, and confusing, and overwhelming, they hear the word doctrine and they run.
[time=730] And yet we're coming to give ourselves to a careful study of it, so why?
[time=734] Well, we've said it before, I wanna say it again, we're trying to close the gap.
[time=738] We're closing the gap with God's help.
[time=742] With God's help and with his direction, we're trying to close this chasm, really, that exists at times, between the deep and profound truth about God, which is our definition of doctrine, trying to close this gap between the deep and profound truth about God and our everyday lives.
[time=763] Our everyday lives need to be connected to this deep and profound truth about God.
[time=768] We've been talking in recent weeks here about actually living meaningful lives, wanting to live lives that in this culture today in the light of all you face, and then in the midst of all that we encounter, we've been talking about really living lives that count, not wasting our lives, but living lives with purpose and meaning, lives that make a difference.
[time=793] We've been reminded that, and I hope you'll write this down if you haven't already, we've been reminded that deep and profound living is possible.
[time=801] It really is, it's not a pipe dream.
[time=804] Deep and profound living is possible when and only when a life is filled up with the understanding and application of deep and profound truth.
[time=816] Doctrine, my friends, we've said it before, matters.
[time=821] And it doesn't matter just so you can know it.
[time=824] It doesn't matter so that you can be prideful and arrogant about all that you know.
[time=828] No, doctrine matters when you and I are willing to connect that doctrine, that deep truth about God to the way you live and the way you choose and the way you parent and the way you're married and the way you work because it all connects.
[time=843] And this morning, in our ongoing look at biblical doctrine
[time=849] through our overview study of the book of Romans, we come to chapter three and what will be a transition in the doctrinal subject matter at hand.
[time=859] If you've been with us in recent weeks, then you know that we've been looking closely at Romans chapter one and Romans chapter two and our first doctrine that we've looked at, the doctrine of condemnation.
[time=872] Man's need, man's deep need, man's desperate need for the what, for the righteousness of God.
[time=881] And as we come to chapter three this morning, we'll find some very important concluding thoughts connected to that doctrine of condemnation.
[time=892] And then, well, you gotta really hang on this morning too 'cause this is quite a ride that we're about to take.
[time=901] Then we come and we'll see Paul transition about halfway through Romans three from condemnation and man's great need for the righteousness of God to go ahead and write it down, the doctrine of justification.
[time=919] We've been looking at the doctrine of condemnation, man's great need for the righteousness of God.
[time=925] And today we'll see in chapter three, Paul introduces to our second doctrine, the doctrine of justification, or better said God's righteousness delivered.
[time=936] This thing that we've been in such great need of, this thing that we're lacking.
[time=944] Now in chapter three delivered.
[time=946] Let me just take you back quickly for those of you catching up with us this morning.
[time=950] Maybe you haven't been here.
[time=951] Let's just show you where we've been briefly in chapters one and two.
[time=955] In the first two chapters of the book of Romans, we learned first of all that the Apostle Paul, who writes the letter to the church at Rome, was passionate about something.
[time=964] Those of you who were here know what it is.
[time=966] Paul is passionate about the what?
[time=970] The gospel.
[time=971] Paul is passionate about the truth, about God's great love for mankind and his willingness to in light of man's sinfulness and depravity provide a bridge between the two, provide a means by which man could live in relationship with God instead of being at enmity or at strife with God he provides his son, Jesus Christ who comes and lives and dies.
[time=997] They bury him, he defeats death, he ascends to the Father, all of that.
[time=1002] Just as God had declared it would be in the law and the prophets, God provides the gospel, this good news of life and forgiveness found only in Christ and Paul my friends experienced that personally and he is passionate about teaching it, he's passionate about living it out, he's passionate about establishing these churches on the foundation of this gospel.
[time=1028] Paul is consumed with the gospel.
[time=1031] We learned that only in the dynamite or the dunamas of that gospel is the righteousness of God delivered, is the righteousness of God able to be revealed and we learned in those first two chapters that the righteousness of God is desperately needed in man because we learned also that the wrath of God is coming actually not only coming future but that the wrath of God is being revealed today against all ungodliness and unrighteousness Romans 118.
[time=1065] We saw in these first two chapters that the immoral man of chapter one is condemned by his depravity and unrighteous acts.
[time=1077] We saw that in that last section of chapter one especially where it just detailed for us the reality of where man goes left to himself and his sinfulness and depravity.
[time=1091] We saw that the moral man or the good man of chapter two is condemned by his unrighteous acts, an unrighteousness revealed and exposed by his self-righteous, arrogant heart.
[time=1105] And now as we come to chapter three
[time=1111] as you begin to read Romans three especially after reading Romans one and two and I hope you've joined us in that endeavor.
[time=1118] And I hope you're getting my emails and I hope you're staying up with your just your one chapter a day commitment so that it's fresh and so that you and I together continue to almost prepare ourselves for these times together.
[time=1132] And as you read chapter three especially having looked at in red chapters one and two it's as if Paul anticipates the reader sitting there thinking to himself there's gotta be, I mean chapter one's a little dark chapter two kind of starts out like it might get a little lighter but then it ends up dark and we realize everybody's in trouble and the reader can sit there and begin to almost think to himself or herself is there any hope at all for man?
[time=1160] Thinking to one's self isn't there anybody out there who's righteous?
[time=1167] Somebody good enough to somehow, some way get in.
[time=1175] Isn't there anybody smart enough?
[time=1180] Isn't there anybody out there who could somehow wave their flag over in the face of God and say, hey, you forgot about me.
[time=1187] I've got what it takes.
[time=1189] But then we come to Romans three, 10.
[time=1193] Then we come to Romans three, 10's my friend
[time=1199] and I just would ask you to look at that with me because here he just closes the door.
[time=1206] God just through the pen of Paul just closes the door on any and all arguments.
[time=1213] There is none as it is written.
[time=1218] There is none, what?
[time=1221] Righteous.
[time=1223] Not even what?
[time=1226] One.
[time=1229] Is there anybody, anybody on the face of the earth that somehow, some way can figure out a way
[time=1240] to get this done?
[time=1241] It says there is none, righteous, not even one.
[time=1248] On that I forget a number of years ago, I think my oldest son was maybe 10, 11 years old and we were sitting there with his sisters and I was trying my best to read to them and to talk with them about the, thank you, about the whole Romans one and two thing.
[time=1268] It wasn't like a theology class at bedtime but we were just talking about some of these things and trying to figure out where man stands and why we need Jesus.
[time=1279] And I remember kind of editing my way through Romans one and then getting to Romans two and then getting to Romans three there in that statement.
[time=1287] And I remember asking the three of them, what do you think?
[time=1290] Where's man stand with God?
[time=1294] And I remember he was probably about 10, he looked up at me and he said, well, dad, I just, I think man's hosed.
[time=1299] And I thought to myself, you know what?
[time=1303] That's really well said, probably better to say it that way than another way, but he is.
[time=1309] What a great summary.
[time=1314] There's just nothing we can do left to ourselves.
[time=1317] There's just nowhere to go.
[time=1318] We are absolutely shut out.
[time=1323] The life and the promises and the hope
[time=1329] of relationship with him because of our sin.
[time=1332] And if three 10's not enough, he just goes on and I'll read it for you, it's powerful.
[time=1337] Passage here, three 10 all the way to verse 20.
[time=1340] Most of this passage kind of lifted out of the Psalms.
[time=1343] It may be in a different font or text in your Bible, but let me just read this to you.
[time=1349] As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one.
[time=1351] There is none who understands, so please don't tell me how smart you are.
[time=1359] Don't tell me how knowledgeable you are.
[time=1362] Don't talk about how bright you are because it says right here, there is nobody who what?
[time=1367] Understands.
[time=1368] There is none who seeks for God.
[time=1372] There is none, it says there who seeks for God.
[time=1376] And I want to make sure you understand that.
[time=1377] That's really true.
[time=1379] Left to himself, man does not seek for God.
[time=1383] If people ask me, why, if that's true, do you say all the time I hear you saying it that you're trying to and we're trying to help seeking people find and follow Christ?
[time=1395] And that's a great question.
[time=1397] And I want to just make sure that you understand that.
[time=1400] Man doesn't seek after God, but make no mistake, man is what?
[time=1405] Seeking.
[time=1406] Oh yes, man is seeking.
[time=1409] Man is searching.
[time=1410] Man is desperately searching for something.
[time=1412] Problem is they're just searching for the wrong thing and they're looking for it in the wrong places, but they're searching.
[time=1418] They're searching for that peace.
[time=1421] They're searching for that significance.
[time=1423] They're looking for anything and everything that might somehow meet, somehow fit that void in their soul because they're living outside of relationship with the God who created them in his image to live intimately with him.
[time=1439] And so they search and they seek, but they don't seek after him.
[time=1444] And we're trying to help seeking people who are going in a thousand different directions, looking for hope in a thousand different places.
[time=1454] Find the one thing that brings true meaning and true peace and true love and true significance.
[time=1459] And the fact of the matter is, they don't even seek God because of our help.
[time=1463] They seek God because God begins to draw them.
[time=1466] God begins to move in them.
[time=1468] And when God begins to draw you, guess what?
[time=1472] You respond.
[time=1473] It's amazing.
[time=1474] We start reading books we never cared about.
[time=1476] We start listening to messages online.
[time=1478] We start getting into conversations we never used to want to get into.
[time=1481] All of a sudden there's an interest.
[time=1483] And all of a sudden there's a curiosity.
[time=1485] And all of a sudden there's this real sense of direction and that's not birthed out of man's natural heart.
[time=1492] That's birthed out of the grace of God that begins to draw man toward himself.
[time=1496] No one left to himself seeks after God.
[time=1502] All have turned aside.
[time=1505] Interesting note here in my Bible.
[time=1507] Versus 10 through, you might want to write this down.
[time=1510] If you're one who likes writing down things and kind of observing sequential patterns from verses 10 through verse 17, you've got three things here that really get addressed.
[time=1524] As Paul kind of once and for all lays down his case for the sinfulness of man.
[time=1529] Character is defined in verses 10 to 12.
[time=1534] Conversation, sins of the tongue, verses 13 and 14.
[time=1538] And sinful conduct in verses 15, 16 and 17.
[time=1543] So there is none righteous, not even one.
[time=1545] There is none who understands.
[time=1546] There is none who seeks for God.
[time=1548] All have turned aside.
[time=1549] Together they have become useless.
[time=1551] There is none who does good.
[time=1553] There is not even one.
[time=1556] Their throat is an open grave.
[time=1558] With their tongues they keep deceiving.
[time=1560] The poison of asps is under their lips.
[time=1563] Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
[time=1566] Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[time=1569] Destruction and misery are in their paths.
[time=1571] And the path of peace they have not known.
[time=1574] There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[time=1579] Now watch this.
[time=1580] And think about the courtroom, if you will.
[time=1584] Think about the picture of the divine courtroom and the judge himself and the defendant, the one who faces all these accusations.
[time=1595] Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law.
[time=1600] So that, watch this.
[time=1602] So that every mouth may be what?
[time=1606] Closed.
[time=1606] It's as if God says, you know what?
[time=1610] I've taken you through these two chapters.
[time=1611] We come now to this point and I just want you to know, I don't wanna hear any more excuses.
[time=1617] I'm not gonna hear any more arguments.
[time=1619] Judge, may I please know?
[time=1621] No, we're done.
[time=1624] We're gonna quiet once and for all.
[time=1627] Any thought or any speculation that there's something you can say to somehow make a case because the case has now been closed.
[time=1636] The gavel's about to come down.
[time=1637] So that every mouth may be closed and look at this and all the world may become what?
[time=1646] Accountable to God.
[time=1647] All the world, accountable to God.
[time=1652] Quiet in the courtroom.
[time=1654] Condemnation.
[time=1655] Remember, this is the doctrine we're studying still here in this section.
[time=1659] Condemnation is at hand.
[time=1661] The verdict is in because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight.
[time=1670] For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
[time=1675] Now look at that right there.
[time=1676] Don't go away from that too quickly.
[time=1678] There are several times he spoke of the law.
[time=1682] And as he speaks of the law here at the end of this section at the beginning of chapter three, you might, like me even this week, I began to look at that and I began to think about the Jews.
[time=1695] I began to think that all of a sudden now somehow in this section he's now turning his attention back to the Jews who were his primary audience and now he is describing for them and maybe only them their condemnation.
[time=1711] But then I remembered what we had learned in chapter one that the law had definitely been given to the Jews through Moses but that the law of God had also been with the Gentiles written in their what?
[time=1726] Their hearts, through their conscience and through creation.
[time=1732] And what we read in chapter two, the law of God, that which is true and right, had actually been revealed to everybody.
[time=1741] So everybody is accountable.
[time=1744] The gavel is coming down.
[time=1749] No more talking, no more excuses.
[time=1755] Objections overruled.
[time=1757] Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
[time=1766] Nobody measures up and now in light of all of that, God does the unthinkable.
[time=1772] In light of all of that, God does the most loving,
[time=1778] the most gracious, the most mind-boggling you've got to be kidding me thing he's ever done.
[time=1784] And all of time, you're ready?
[time=1786] Here it comes.
[time=1787] The doctrine of justification.
[time=1790] God's righteousness delivered.
[time=1794] Look with me if you would at Romans 3, 21.
[time=1797] I'll never forget in seminary one day hearing a New Testament scholar, this professor that we had as we sat there in a room one afternoon, he said to us, he said, "Men, you should be so very, very grateful "for Romans 3, 21.
[time=1813] "You should be deeply, like beyond words,
[time=1820] "deeply grateful for the great truth of Romans 3, 21."
[time=1827] And I would say these next five verses read along with me.
[time=1831] Here we go.
[time=1833] But now in light of all that, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested.
[time=1844] Manifested, made alive in man, brought to man.
[time=1849] The righteousness of God has been manifested,
[time=1855] being witnessed by the law and the prophets.
[time=1858] What do you mean?
[time=1859] Even the righteousness, Paul says, I'll tell you what I mean.
[time=1862] Even the righteousness of God now delivered through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who what?
[time=1871] Say it, believe, believe what?
[time=1874] The gospel.
[time=1875] For there is no distinction.
[time=1878] The righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe.
[time=1885] For there is no distinction.
[time=1889] Poor people get to experience the righteousness of God.
[time=1896] Asians and Hispanics and blacks and whites get to experience the righteousness of God.
[time=1901] It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter where you come from, it doesn't matter what your heritage is, your past ethnically or your past personally.
[time=1912] Everybody has this opportunity to experience the righteousness of God.
[time=1919] For all have sinned, Romans 323, for all have sinned and fall short, it's the very definition of sin to fall short, Harmartia, to fall short of God's standard.
[time=1931] For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified, there it is, being justified as a gift by his grace, how, through the, here comes the gospel again, through the redemption, which is in Christ Jesus, whom God displayed on that cross, on that hill in front of everyone to see whom God displayed publicly as a, uh-oh, big word, woo, woo, woo, big word alert, right?
[time=1963] But we're not gonna be afraid.
[time=1965] We're not gonna go running.
[time=1966] We're not gonna be intimidated by the word propitiation because the word propitiation isn't anything to be afraid of.
[time=1975] It's a word to be really, really grateful for it.
[time=1977] Let me just tell you, you can write this down.
[time=1979] Let me just tell you, it's meaning, it's crucial to the significance of Christ's sacrifice.
[time=1984] This word carries the idea of appeasement, right?
[time=1988] Appeasement or satisfaction.
[time=1991] In this case, Christ's violent death, his thorough sacrifice satisfied the offended holiness and wrath of God, the wrath of God which is being revealed
[time=2006] and will be revealed, Christ's sacrifice appeases.
[time=2011] It satisfies the offended holiness and wrath of God, the wrath of God against those for whom Christ died.
[time=2022] That would be you and that would be me.
[time=2025] As a propitiation in his blood through faith.
[time=2033] This, all that happened right there was to demonstrate his righteousness because in the forbearance of God, oh, let's last week terminology, in his patience, in his tolerance, in his kindness, because in the forbearance of God, he had passed over the sins previously committed for the demonstration I say of his righteousness.
[time=2057] There that is again.
[time=2058] The righteousness of God that man desperately needed now is delivered of his righteousness at the present time so that he would be just and the justifier of the one who has what?
[time=2073] Who has faith in whom?
[time=2075] Jesus Christ.
[time=2080] Okay, now I prayed and asked God to help me with this all week long, what I'm about to try and say.
[time=2088] He's faithful, I don't know.
[time=2092] I don't even know if it worked first hour.
[time=2094] It's just one of those deals where I just don't know if I'm able to or anybody's able to somehow, like with words, get this across.
[time=2103] And so I've learned in all my years, I've learned there are times where I just need to say it and I'll just trust God and the Spirit of God to deliver it to you in as significant a way as possible.
[time=2119] So I'm gonna just try to help you right here, understand justification and what that really means, and what he really did in justifying you and me.
[time=2138] To be justified is a legal term.
[time=2142] In the original Greek, it's a legal term, which means to be declared as righteous, to be declared as righteous.
[time=2154] See in our courtrooms, go back to the legal setting, in our courtrooms, if we get off, we're declared not what?
[time=2162] Okay, hang on to that.
[time=2166] The word means to be declared righteous.
[time=2170] It's not just to be cleared of all charges, it's not just an ex-con, now given a fresh start, but it is instead to be justified.
[time=2180] It is a complete and thorough reclassification of one's deepest and most personal identity before God.
[time=2194] I wanna show you a clip here that maybe even says it better.
[time=2198] I don't know, I sure love getting to watch it, my son, and some of his friends listen to a group named Shane and Shane, and in the middle of a Shane and Shane video on YouTube, my son showed me this clip that somebody inserted from a guy I have great respect for, Pastor John Piper.
[time=2217] And so in the middle of this video, they throw in this clip from Piper, where he happens to be describing and defining justification to watch.
[time=2227] - I keep not mistaken, the exceeding wonder
[time=2236] that not only does God look upon a guilty person
[time=2242] in the courtroom and exercise clemency, and forgive him and say, you're guilty, I forgive you, go and sin no more, but he also, beyond all the imagination, looks upon this guilty center, and does not just say, you're guilty, I forgive you, he says, you're not guilty.
[time=2262] I mean, forgive this is understandable, get a little bit of understanding.
[time=2269] We try to have some way to get our heads around forgiveness, you let it go, you don't hold it against her.
[time=2274] But this, look me right in the face, John Piper, right in the face, share the hair and say, right in the face.
[time=2284] (upbeat music) - Being justified as a gift by his grace,
[time=2308] through the redemption, which is in Christ Jesus.
[time=2312] It's an amazing concept, my friends.
[time=2319] It is a complete and utter reclassification
[time=2325] of who you really are at the deepest part of who you are.
[time=2330] I learned a definition, I think when I was in high school from my dad, I've used it numbers of times of my own kids and with others in an effort to try and simplify this thing.
[time=2342] It's really not simple, it's very profound when you think about it.
[time=2345] I was taught that justification really means just as if I never sinned.
[time=2352] And we can say that phrase just as if I never sinned, and we can quickly move on to the next phrase, but wait a minute, stop and think about that phrase.
[time=2362] Stop and think about what you've done.
[time=2364] Stop and think about where I've been.
[time=2366] Stop and think about the choices we've made.
[time=2368] Stop and think about the heinous stuff that's transpired.
[time=2371] Stop and think about the violation of his character and his love.
[time=2375] Stop and think about the absolute wretchedness of you and me.
[time=2380] And yet at that point in time, he looked at you and me
[time=2386] and declared us not just not guilty, but righteous.
[time=2393] And some of you in the room today need to hear that.
[time=2396] Some of you need to be reminded of how he,
[time=2402] you've lived your life, scorned and ashamed and torn down by the view of others and the things that you've done or maybe even are doing in this unbelievable gospel transaction when God redeems sinful people.
[time=2419] Understand that when he justifies you, it is a completely different you.
[time=2425] It is a new picture.
[time=2427] It is a reclassified soul.
[time=2429] And the righteousness, get this.
[time=2433] And the righteousness of God travels from God through the person of Christ, our great mediator.
[time=2440] And through Christ, the righteousness of God is theological term imputed.
[time=2446] That means to be deposited into the righteousness of God through the work of Christ is imputed into you, not a part of it, not a portion of it, not just this much until we see how good you do down the road.
[time=2461] No, all of it at the point of salvation is delivered into you and you then are the recipient of the righteousness of God through the justification and the verdict that's been given, not that you're guilty, but now that you're righteous.
[time=2478] Because of anything you've done?
[time=2479] No, but because of his great love.
[time=2482] Interesting, I read about this this week, the imputation, the passing on that Jesus did.
[time=2489] God brings to Jesus, the righteousness.
[time=2491] Jesus passes that on to you.
[time=2493] Jesus knew something about things being imputed because it was your sin and mine that got imputed into who, Jesus.
[time=2507] It was your sin and mine that gets placed in and on Christ.
[time=2512] Was it his sin?
[time=2514] Yes or no?
[time=2515] No.
[time=2516] When God gives us God's righteousness, was it our righteousness?
[time=2521] No, no, it was this amazing thing, how it just works both ways.
[time=2524] We, because of our sin, it gets put on Christ.
[time=2528] He's the propitiation, the sacrifice, boom.
[time=2531] God's righteousness comes on to Jesus.
[time=2535] Jesus passes it on to us completely and fully delivered.
[time=2540] Just as if I never sinned.
[time=2544] Paul now moves, let's pick up the pace a little bit here.
[time=2547] Paul now moves and you can read through the rest of chapter three.
[time=2550] Again, some great truth that continues to make much of the truth we've already looked at this morning.
[time=2557] Now Paul moves to chapter four.
[time=2559] Turn there if you would.
[time=2560] And in an effort to further explain and illustrate justification, Paul uses the example of who, Abraham.
[time=2570] Paul uses the example of Abraham.
[time=2574] Why in Paul's effort to now is he kind of turn, now he kind of does turn toward the Jewish people.
[time=2580] Now he kind of does turn toward those whom he cared so much about and wanted desperately for them to move away from their ritual into this relationship with Christ.
[time=2590] Why Abraham?
[time=2591] I'll ask you that question.
[time=2592] Why do you think now with the audience being the Jews again, why would he choose Abraham to illustrate this great truth of justification?
[time=2602] Well, because the audience are the Jews, who was viewed as the father of the Jews?
[time=2608] Answer, Abraham.
[time=2610] And who of all, think about this, who of all religious communities would struggle with the foundational underpinnings of justification, that it comes from someone else, not yourself, that personal effort won't work, that externals and appearance and ritual won't get you in, who would struggle with that more than anybody, the Jews?
[time=2632] And so we read Romans four, one to five.
[time=2636] Listen, follow along with me.
[time=2638] What then shall we say?
[time=2641] He knows where their minds were going.
[time=2643] He knows how they would now take in chapters one, two, and three.
[time=2646] So he goes, boom, right to where they would be focused in their own hearts and minds.
[time=2651] What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, according to the flesh, has found?
[time=2658] For if Abraham was justified, declared righteous,
[time=2664] by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
[time=2668] For what does the scripture say?
[time=2670] And here he quotes from Genesis 15, I believe.
[time=2675] It says, Abraham, everybody say the word out loud, believed.
[time=2680] Abraham, for what does the scripture say?
[time=2683] It says Abraham believed God, and it was credited, or your translation may read reckoned to him as what?
[time=2692] Righteousness.
[time=2694] Now to the one who works, there are reference to the law, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due, but to the one who does not work, but say it out loud, believes in him, in him who justifies the ungodly.
[time=2712] His faith is credited as righteousness.
[time=2719] Credited, it's a, you might wanna write this down, it's an accounting term.
[time=2724] Do we have any accountants in the room, any bankers, any numbers, people?
[time=2728] The word credited or reckoned is an accounting term that meant to credit or deposit into another's account, and it's a really basic picture, but one worth painting for you quickly.
[time=2740] There is an account that's empty, there is an account that is lacking, there is an account that is in need, and there is an account that isn't lacking, there is an account that's full, and the one who owns the account that's full, by virtue of their doing, and by virtue of their choice, not by virtue of the one who is in need, credits to the account that's lacking, all the funds needed for survival.
[time=2765] It was reckoned to him, it was credited to Abraham
[time=2772] as righteousness.
[time=2774] Well, it's Corbin and Adam come up, I wanna just draw your attention to verse 18.
[time=2781] Romans 4, 18.
[time=2784] And I wanna set it up this way, stay with me here.
[time=2789] How much of this, how much of this was God?
[time=2793] Here's what Paul wants to begin to just drive home as he makes his way through chapter four, how much of this was of God?
[time=2803] How much faith did Abraham have to exercise?
[time=2807] I mean, how much of this was of God, and because it was that much of God, we begin to see how little it was of man's own effort, and in the absence of man's own effort, we see man's great faith, his willingness to trust.
[time=2822] How much of it was God?
[time=2824] How much faith did Abraham have to exercise?
[time=2827] Listen, in hope against hope, many of you know the story.
[time=2832] In hope against hope, he Abraham believed so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, so shall your descendants be.
[time=2844] There'll be nations of them.
[time=2846] God had promised Abraham and Genesis.
[time=2850] Without becoming weak in faith, watch this, without becoming weak in faith, he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead, since he was about what?
[time=2864] A hundred years old.
[time=2866] Without becoming weak in faith, he contemplates his own run down aged weary body,
[time=2875] and the deadness of Sarah's womb, who was also about that same age.
[time=2880] Yet with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief, but grew strong, his faith grows, his faith is strengthened.
[time=2893] He did not waver in unbelief,
[time=2899] but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what God had promised, he was able to perform, therefore, it was credited to him as what, say it, righteousness.
[time=2912] Now for his sake, now not for his sake only, was it written that it was credited to him, but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited as those who believe in him, who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
[time=2934] He who has delivered over, he who was delivered over because of our transgressions and was raised because of our what, our justification.
[time=2944] I know it's hard to believe, I know it's hard to fathom, I know it's hard to put words to, but that's what he did.
[time=2952] And that's what he does.
[time=2954] When someone calls upon the name of the Lord, when someone fully surrenders one's heart and soul to Christ, this is what transpires, this is what God enacts, this is what's accomplished.
[time=2969] And I think it's worthy of our response.
[time=2972] Don't leave this morning, stand if you would, and let's do what God does.
[time=2976] Let's sing, let's worship him in spirit and in truth, and allow the great truth of Romans one, two, three, and four to ring in our hearts as we sing about the great gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2992] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=3121] Try singing that.
[time=3130] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=3271] - Let's sing that one more time.
[time=3275] I will call upon the name of the Lord and be saved.
[time=3278] [MUSIC - 16 seconds]
[time=3299] - It's Corbin, just keep singing that.
[time=3309] I'll just ask him to sing that quietly.
[time=3310] I'll ask you to bow your heads.
[time=3312] You know, sometimes we make this really complicated.
[time=3317] And I want to just make sure you understand today that it's not.
[time=3323] Do you want to experience, and not just experience emotionally, but know in the depths of your heart that you're saved, redeemed, justified, and made new?
[time=3334] You want to experience a relationship with a God who made you in his image.
[time=3338] A relationship that you've been separated from because of your sin.
[time=3343] If you've never bow the knee of your heart and fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, you can this morning call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=3354] You can say it out loud, you can say it quietly, you can say it on your knees, you can say it next to your bed.
[time=3361] You can say it in your car, but when you, from the depth of your heart, say it to the Lord.
[time=3368] Oh Lord, save me, oh Lord Jesus, please.
[time=3373] Save me, redeem me, make me new.
[time=3379] When you say that, pray it, when you communicate it, he hears you.
[time=3385] Thanks Corbin.
[time=3388] By the God we stand before you this morning, and if there would be anybody in this room that would for the first time, want to be able to just say those words, to just say these words, oh God, I am a sinner and my sin separates me and has separated me from you for so long.
[time=3410] God, I'm grateful for the gospel, the good news of your son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3414] Oh God, I'm grateful for your willingness to have him come and die on my behalf as an appeasement for the judgment that had to come.
[time=3425] Oh God, thank you.
[time=3427] And I got today, I surrender my whole heart and all of my life to you.
[time=3432] And I commit to follow after your son.
[time=3437] I love you, God, and I'm grateful for the gift, justification to be viewed by you as if I've never sinned.
[time=3447] What great joy.
[time=3449] Father God, there may be those in the room this morning who set those things, who are feeling those things, crying out to you this morning in that fashion.
[time=3460] In God, we know you hear them.
[time=3463] Father God, we're privileged.
[time=3465] And we mean that to have been able to be in this place this morning.
[time=3468] We love you and we thank you for your truth and we're thankful for the gift of worship and the gift of the scriptures and our chance God to experience all of that in this setting with you.
[time=3479] We love you in your son's name, we pray.
[time=3483] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
