[time=312] (upbeat music)
[time=318] (audience clapping) [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=338] Sing it again.
[time=341] [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=403] (audience clapping) (upbeat music) - We worship you God.
[time=411] [AMEN] - First Chronicles 29, if you would turn there in your Old Testament, Samuel Kings, then Chronicles.
[time=423] And first Chronicles 29, David is nearing the end of his life
[time=430] and he gives, he's nervous about his young son coming to be king in his place.
[time=435] He gives this massive offering to the temple.
[time=438] He gives 200 plus thousand pounds of gold as an offering to the Lord, 3,000 talents.
[time=448] One talents, 75 pounds to the math.
[time=450] I tried to do it.
[time=451] It works out.
[time=452] It's a lot of gold.
[time=453] First Chronicles 29, verse 10.
[time=457] After this, the people give their free, real offerings.
[time=461] And then David says this, he prays his prayer.
[time=462] David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the assembly.
[time=465] And David said, blessed are you, O Lord, the God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever.
[time=471] Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty.
[time=479] For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours.
[time=482] Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all.
[time=490] In a few moments, the choir is gonna lead us in singing those words.
[time=495] Psalm 115, if you can turn to the right in your Bibles, there's a few pages to Psalm 115.
[time=501] The Psalmist is not named in this Psalm.
[time=504] We don't know he wrote it.
[time=505] I like to think it was David.
[time=506] The very same David from first Chronicles 29.
[time=509] Psalm 115 and verse one is very much to the point
[time=515] of the Psalm that they're about to sing this morning.
[time=517] Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name,
[time=523] give glory for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness.
[time=529] The Psalmist asks God to make sure
[time=535] that his name receives great glory for the sake of God's own steadfast love.
[time=541] That's top shelf kind of stuff.
[time=544] The Psalmist insists that God received the glory, not himself, and that he received that glory because God is forever merciful and faithful.
[time=554] Romans five says that we've been justified by faith.
[time=559] More on that later.
[time=560] In Revelation seven, I'll take all the way to Revelation chapter seven.
[time=564] In Revelation chapter seven, people from every nation,
[time=571] every language, you sang that just now, are singing a song.
[time=575] They're singing all over the Bible.
[time=579] Revelation chapter seven.
[time=581] We will be in this crowd Sunday, friends, sing this very song.
[time=585] Verse 12, Revelation chapter seven, saying, Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom
[time=596] and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever.
[time=603] I would ask you to remember these words throughout the course of the week and as we are singing and sung to you this morning, may we join and rejoice in our hearts, the God has done great things.
[time=615] Pray with me.
[time=616] Lord, you are good and your mercy endures forever.
[time=623] I am in need of that forever mercy, Father.
[time=626] I'm grateful that you provide it, that's new every morning, your faithfulness is great.
[time=630] Lord, as we give to you and to your kingdom, pray that you be honored in it.
[time=635] I pray that you would receive great glory.
[time=637] I pray that we would sing that song, Lord, not only in the age to come, but in this age as well.
[time=643] I pray all this with great thanksgiving and Jesus name.
[time=645] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=667] [MUSIC - 355 seconds]
[time=1032] (audience applauds) - Hey, if you'd open your Bibles to the Book of Romans,
[time=1045] we're gonna jump back into our study this morning.
[time=1048] We've entitled this study, "Why Disciples Need Doctrine." Why disciples need doctrine?
[time=1055] And we've come to the Book of Romans in our effort to answer that question, just to clarify, for some, this has not been, most of you can tell by now, this has not been a verse by verse study of the Book of Romans.
[time=1070] We could do that, that would be a phenomenal endeavor.
[time=1073] It might take a few years, but it would be a good few years.
[time=1076] I promise you that.
[time=1078] What we've done instead is that we've chosen to, in this study of doctrine, we've allowed the Book of Romans to kind of be for us an overview.
[time=1086] All through the Book of Romans, we see doctrine after doctrine after doctrine, being highlighted, and we've just kind of been making our way through in kind of an overview fashion, chapter by chapter, looking at these different doctrines.
[time=1100] We've defined doctrine as deep truth, the deep and profound truth about God and God's dealings with man.
[time=1108] And in chapter, at the beginning of Romans, chapter one, two, and the first part of three, we saw the doctrine of condemnation.
[time=1116] We saw the doctrine of condemnation, man's great need for the righteousness of God, and then we got to the end of chapter three and all of chapter four last week, where we see a new doctrine, the doctrine of justification.
[time=1129] God's righteousness delivered.
[time=1131] God's righteousness, as we said last week, imputed.
[time=1134] The righteousness, the very same righteousness of God delivered to sinful, needy man through the person of Christ and his work for you and I on the cross.
[time=1147] We learned that our sin was in essence imputed onto Christ and we learned that God's righteousness comes through Christ back down to man.
[time=1158] And we've been justified just as if we never what?
[time=1163] Declared righteous, a complete and total reclassification
[time=1169] of your entire being in this moment where God redeems and justifies us.
[time=1177] And we come now this morning to chapter five and this doctrine of justification continues, but before we get there, I wanted to just take a few minutes this morning and I'm gonna try and keep this brief.
[time=1189] But I wanna just take you back for a moment to what our original purpose was in this study.
[time=1193] We said and we all agreed that it would be very important to look at the deep and profound truth about God, but not just so that we could better understand the deep and profound truth about God, but we all agreed that there has been in existence for quite some time this gap or this chasm between deep and profound truth about God and your everyday and my everyday living.
[time=1218] And this is problematic and we've all agreed that it is because the deep truth about God shouldn't be distant from the everyday living and choices that you and I make should be very related, it should be very united, it should be very close.
[time=1234] And I wanna just make sure as we're making our way through this that we stay while interested in the deep and profound truth about God, I wanna stay practical, I wanna make sure we're making application, asking ourselves hard questions and being willing to confront ourselves with this truth and the implication it really does have on the way we live.
[time=1254] I wrote a few things down this morning and then we'll move on.
[time=1257] First of all, I just picked three topics that we've been through, wanna make sure we give some thought to them this morning, Paul was consumed with the gospel, that's the first thing I wrote down.
[time=1267] Paul was consumed with the gospel, I wanna make sure we make some application to this this morning, he lived life, consumed as the screen says, he lived life consumed with people's need for spiritual progress, new spiritual life for those searching, deepened spiritual life for those who were say, he was consumed with spiritual progress, spiritual progress made possible by the dunamos of the gospel, the gospel, the good news about what God did to redeem lost man through the death and resurrection of his son, this consumes Paul's mind.
[time=1311] It consumes his thinking, it consumes his activity, it consumes his planning, it's consumed with helping people hear and accept the good news about Jesus, having lived the bad news himself, don't forget that about Paul, right?
[time=1329] He had murdered, he had murdered and tortured Christians
[time=1335] and having experienced the depths of sin and complete depravity, he is consumed with making much of the good news that the righteousness of God himself can be through faith in Christ delivered to the human soul and the human life.
[time=1355] So we've got to keep this practical.
[time=1358] We've got to work hard to keep these thoughts and this kind of teaching real and every day.
[time=1365] So let me ask you this morning, what are you consumed with?
[time=1367] You might want to write that down.
[time=1368] What are, and I'm really asking, and I really want you to think about it, what are you consumed with?
[time=1378] You might ask, well, how would I know what I'm consumed with?
[time=1382] And I think a really good thing to ask yourself is, what do you think about?
[time=1386] What do you find yourself thinking about more often than not?
[time=1389] What do you find yourself dwelling on?
[time=1391] What do you find motivates you at the deepest level?
[time=1394] What is it that thrills you?
[time=1396] What is it that lights your jet?
[time=1398] What is it that keeps you up at night?
[time=1399] What is it that really turns your mind and gets you thinking and engages your spirit?
[time=1407] Is it the spiritual progress of people?
[time=1410] Is it the gospel?
[time=1412] Is it what is true and right and good about God?
[time=1416] And not only his dealings with you, but the opportunity he gives you to be a part of his dealings with others.
[time=1422] Are you consumed with the gospel?
[time=1425] Are you consumed with spiritual progress?
[time=1427] Or, and you just have to be as honest as you're willing to be.
[time=1431] For this to be practical and meaningful, you have to be as honest as you would be willing to be before God in your own heart.
[time=1439] Or are you consumed with financial progress?
[time=1444] Are you consumed with relationship progress?
[time=1448] Are you consumed with achievement progress?
[time=1451] Are you consumed with pleasure progress?
[time=1455] Your own?
[time=1456] Are you consumed with athletic progress?
[time=1461] And my encouragement to you this morning, my friends, is to be honest and to be careful.
[time=1467] To be so very careful and to understand where your life will end up, to understand where my life will go, to understand and to be honest about what happens when you and I are consumed with things other than the gospel, truth about God.
[time=1485] It's an empty place, it's a lonely place, it's a broken place.
[time=1491] It's a place that doesn't work, it's a place that doesn't make much of him and brings no glory to him.
[time=1498] Paul was consumed with the gospel.
[time=1500] Keep this real, my friends, continue to ask yourselves these questions.
[time=1505] Number two, I wrote this down.
[time=1506] I think more so just from what we learned in chapter one.
[time=1510] I wanted to remind you of it this morning, depravity shows itself early, write that down.
[time=1514] Depravity shows itself early.
[time=1518] What do I mean by that?
[time=1520] Well, go in your bibles, go to Romans one.
[time=1523] And I wanna take you back to Romans one, 28.
[time=1528] And we could go back further than 28 because really once you got to about 24, it got pretty dark, it got pretty drastic.
[time=1537] I mean, Romans one, especially the last half of it, if you'll remember, was this picture of where man goes and what man does.
[time=1545] It's this picture of where man progresses in his sinfulness and his rebellion and his depravity when left to himself.
[time=1554] And if you can recall the picture that Paul paints here is a very desperate one.
[time=1560] And I want you to see something here this morning as we look again just briefly at this passage that paints this desperate dark picture of absolute sinful depravity.
[time=1570] And just as, pick it up in 28, and just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, man, left to himself, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, being filled with all unrighteousness and wickedness and greed and evil, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, they are gossips, slanderers.
[time=1601] Watch this, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful.
[time=1606] Here you go, inventors of evil.
[time=1610] This is dark stuff.
[time=1612] Next phrase is what?
[time=1615] Say it out loud.
[time=1616] Say it louder.
[time=1619] Do you ever stop and just think, where'd that come from?
[time=1627] We're talking about wickedness.
[time=1632] And we're talking about evil.
[time=1634] We're talking about Peter, people who murder.
[time=1637] We're talking about, he's giving us a list.
[time=1640] He's talking about folks who invent evil things to do.
[time=1643] And then he talks about children who disobey parents.
[time=1648] Do you think that maybe he's referring to older kids,
[time=1655] like you and me who now are so far gone, giving themselves to all these kinds of evil things.
[time=1659] And in doing that, we're kind of disobeying mom and dad.
[time=1662] It's interesting, there's a word he could have used in here.
[time=1665] There's a word in the Greek he could have used for older children, he didn't use that word.
[time=1669] He uses the word for what?
[time=1671] You guessed it, younger ones.
[time=1675] The disobedience of younger children
[time=1682] is placed smack dab in the middle of this list of depravity and rebellion and dark, seedy sin.
[time=1694] Because I believe God wants to remind you and God wants to remind me that there is a lot at stake in the lives and the hearts of these little ones that God has given to you and to me.
[time=1708] And I want you to understand this, there's nothing you and I can do in and of ourselves to erase their depravity.
[time=1715] We understand that they're depraved, don't we?
[time=1718] Anybody ever had a kid raise your hand?
[time=1722] You know you didn't thank you, you know you didn't, you know as they grow older you've seen it, right?
[time=1729] As they grow older they pick up your evil, right?
[time=1732] Not your head, right?
[time=1734] But you understand they were saying no from the moment they could speak.
[time=1739] You understand, you saw it in them.
[time=1741] And it's not just your experience that tells you this, the scriptures tell us this.
[time=1746] We talked about this verse a few weeks ago, Psalm 51.5.
[time=1749] David says in Psalm 51.5, "Behold I was brought forth in iniquity and in sin my mother conceived me." This doesn't mean that what your mother was doing that night was sinful, it means that your mother was sinful, like your father was sinful because they're human, because Adam was sinful.
[time=1768] We had that discussion.
[time=1770] We're sinful from the moment that we're conceived.
[time=1774] And that depravity and that sinfulness gets erased
[time=1780] only by the blood of Christ and that young man or that young woman at some point in time, bowing the knee of their heart and fully surrendering their heart and life to Christ.
[time=1791] But my point over here is that up until that time you and I have the privileged opportunity to curb depravity, if you will, to influence it, to point it toward what's true and right, to lovingly and faithfully bring the discipline and the correction and the pointing in a new direction and to do that with great faithfulness and diligence because depravity, which leads to this, starts early and do not for a moment, kid yourself and think somehow, some way that the patterns that are developed early don't play into the decisions that are made later.
[time=1838] And I just, I encourage you this morning to stay faithful,
[time=1844] to come alongside and point them, even though they are depraved and even though their sinfulness is serious to point them lovingly and faithfully day in and day out, even if it means discomfort, even if it means it's gonna mess up your night, even if it means it's gonna take a little bit more time.
[time=1864] You and I have the privilege to help young boys and young girls not be disobedient to parents, to curb that and point it in a new direction.
[time=1875] Third thought I wrote down, we really are righteous, so let's live like it.
[time=1881] We really are righteous and I really want you to focus on that, we really are righteous.
[time=1888] We touched on this last week, I wanted to say this to you again this morning, there are many of you in the room because of where you've lived, because of what you've done, because of what your past may entail, there are many of us in the room, and many of you listening on the broadcast, and you have for years and years and years considered yourself to be this.
[time=1906] Because of choices you've made, or because of the choices perpetrated on you by others, you have viewed yourself as this, and it hasn't been very lovely, it hasn't been a good picture, it hasn't been one that's very peaceful or encouraging, it's been a desperate picture, it's been a dark picture, and we need to be reminded this morning that the Word of God says that at the point where you fully surrender your heart and life to Him, this righteousness of God, this new life, this changed and altered and reclassified person, that really happens in God's righteousness through the death of Christ comes to you and you are made new.
[time=1949] You really are, and you don't have to believe what you got told, I wrote this down, when you tell a kid, I've seen this happen, you've seen this happen, tragically it happens.
[time=1959] When you tell a kid from day one that he's a loser, and you know there's kids who grow up being told that, maybe you're in this room this morning and you got told that, when you tell a kid from day one that he's a loser, that he's absolutely no good, that he's pathetic and weak, and that he'll never amount to anything, that kid left to himself amounts to what?
[time=1982] Nothing, it's just how it goes.
[time=1985] But thank God, look at 2 Corinthians 5, would you just turn there real quick, after Romans comes 1 Corinthians, go to 2 Corinthians 5, here's a couple of verses for you to write down, I mean like write them out, here's a couple of verses for you to share with your kids as you help them and their new spiritual identity, here's a couple of verses that you should have in your car, put this on your bathroom mirror, hang this in your room, tell yourself this, preach this to yourself again and again and again, because who you are, who you believe yourself to be, your identity, every day has an influence on the choices that you make.
[time=2029] And 2 Corinthians 5, 17 says therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a what, say it out loud, new creature, the old things passed away, the old reputation is gone, the old stories about you and what you did are gone, what people thought of you, gone, choices you made gone in Christ you're a new creature, a new creation, the old things passed away, the old new things, do you see that there say amen, new things have come, a new identity, a new life, a new hope, a new future, a new eternity, look at verse 21, how'd all that happen because here's a righteousness, here's a justification verse for you this morning, he made him who knew no sin, that's Christ, to be sin, all your sin and all my sin got put on him.
[time=2086] We talked about it last week, imputed to him, he made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that we might become the what, say it, the righteousness of God, you really are righteous and you need to tell yourself that and you need to read that again and again and again, you are righteous, you're righteous, he's made you clean, he's made you new if you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=2117] Well, we gotta keep this real impractical, so I hope that just encourages you to think through some things we've taught on, let's jump ahead here to Romans five, can't we?
[time=2127] Romans five and Paul continues in his explanation and his teaching to the church at Rome on the topic of justification, God's righteousness delivered to sinful man.
[time=2141] Romans five, this morning I wanna read Romans five one through 11, Romans five verses one through 11, let me read it and then I'm gonna explain to you where he's going here and would you in honor of God's word, would you stand and let me read this to you?
[time=2157] It says in Romans five one, therefore having been justified declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2170] through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand and we exalt in hope in hope of the glory of God.
[time=2184] And not only this, we also exalt in our tribulations knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance and perseverance brings about proven character and proven character brings about hope and hope what?
[time=2197] Hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us for a while we were still helpless.
[time=2212] At the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
[time=2217] For one will hardly die for a righteous man though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die but God demonstrates his own love, his own personal intimate love toward you and me.
[time=2231] He demonstrates this love toward us in that while we were yet sinners in the Greek that would read while we were still sinning.
[time=2240] You realize that, right?
[time=2242] He did all this while we were still sinning.
[time=2245] We hadn't stopped.
[time=2246] We hadn't quit violating him.
[time=2251] We hadn't pulled back from all of our offense and iniquity.
[time=2257] You know, while we were sinning Christ died for us much more than having now been justified by his blood we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him.
[time=2270] For if while we were enemies we were helpless, we were ungodly, we were sinners and now we're enemies all in these first few verses.
[time=2280] For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his son much more than that having been reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
[time=2293] And not only this but we also exalt in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received the reconciliation, the repairing of the relationship, the bringing back together of that which was severed.
[time=2311] Father God, would you and your spirit please do what you and your spirit only can do?
[time=2317] And God, would you make this truth something that we can understand?
[time=2321] God, would you make it alive?
[time=2322] Would you penetrate our lives and our hearts and our souls deeply with its truth and its implication?
[time=2331] And God, may we this morning begin to better understand the full scope of what it means to be declared righteous by you, not only at this point, God of surrender, but in the everyday and living out of our faith?
[time=2345] God, we ask this in your son's name, amen.
[time=2348] You can be seated.
[time=2349] Well, let me ask you if I can't just follow along with me on the screen.
[time=2354] I believe these words, these notes will be up there for you.
[time=2358] I wanted to just kind of set the backdrop if I could of Romans five.
[time=2362] Here's how it goes.
[time=2363] Having concluded in chapter four that God alone, you can see this on the screens, that God alone justifies sinners.
[time=2373] Paul now addresses the notion which was present among many that although salvation came by faith alone, it would be salvation would be preserved by good works.
[time=2386] Stop right there.
[time=2387] There were some read about it this week.
[time=2390] There were some in that day, in that time that in essence kind of said to Paul, okay, okay, what if we can buy this notion?
[time=2400] Remember who was Paul's primary audience?
[time=2402] We taught you that a couple of weeks ago.
[time=2404] Paul's primary audience were unbelieving who?
[time=2407] Jews who were very, very, very accustomed to nothing being out of their hands.
[time=2413] It was all up to them and what they did and how well they did it.
[time=2417] And there were those now in this discussion who in essence were saying to Paul, okay, okay, what if I buy the notion that salvation is completely and absolutely of God and I have nothing to do with it?
[time=2431] But what they were saying was that at least give us this though, at least give us the fact that if we're going to preserve this faith, if somehow we're going to make our way through the rest of our lives and be assured of that faith, that certainly, the preservation of the faith, that's gotta be on us.
[time=2451] That must be a result of my good works and my faithfulness and Paul says what?
[time=2458] No.
[time=2459] No, not at all.
[time=2463] No, Paul states, and we'll see it here in these first 11 verses.
[time=2466] Paul states that they are in that redemptive union, they are bound eternally to Jesus Christ, preserved only by his power and not by human effort.
[time=2478] How does the Christian know for sure?
[time=2483] Here's your question for the passage.
[time=2485] How does the Christian know for sure that his faith will be preserved?
[time=2491] Write that down.
[time=2494] How does the Christian know for sure that his faith will be preserved Romans five verses one to 11?
[time=2498] Number one, here you go.
[time=2500] How does the Christian know?
[time=2501] Because of number one, because of his peace, write this down, because of his peace with God.
[time=2508] The Christian knows for sure that his faith will endure, that his faith will be preserved because of his peace with God.
[time=2519] Interesting, my friends.
[time=2521] The word, the word for peace used here in the text, doesn't, don't miss this, doesn't mean a subjective internal sense of calm and serenity.
[time=2536] We oftentimes, most of us in the room, if I ask you what does peace mean, that's exactly where we'd go.
[time=2541] And if I ask you what does peace in your own life look like, this is exactly where we travel.
[time=2545] But this word means instead, it indicates an external, very objective, non-subjective, very objective reality.
[time=2556] Here's what I mean.
[time=2557] There's the subjective peace that one experiences when you're not fighting with your spouse.
[time=2564] Just use that as an example.
[time=2566] You're fighting with your spouse.
[time=2568] You're not getting along.
[time=2569] You're in this three day long argument.
[time=2571] Nobody's talking and you don't feel very what?
[time=2575] Peaceful, it's no peace.
[time=2577] There's this subjective peace that one experiences when you're not fighting with your spouse.
[time=2585] When your kids are behaving well, there's peace.
[time=2589] Things are good.
[time=2590] When you land the big account, when you make the game-winning shot, when you ace the test you studied so hard for, this kind of peace is a feeling.
[time=2599] We feel the peace.
[time=2603] And with spouses and chemistry tests, this feeling comes and it, what?
[time=2610] Goes.
[time=2611] This isn't the peace we have with God in Romans 5.1.
[time=2617] The peace my friends that we have with God in Romans 5.1 is objective, it's fixed, it's real, it's factual, it's not subject to variation.
[time=2626] The peace we have with God is the once and for all, catch this, so once and for all absence of conflict, where there once was spiritual war and strife, where there was once enmity between man and God, where there was once spiritual battle, there will never be again God's saving, justifying work has completely freed us and we now live and can experience with him an enduring peace.
[time=2656] And you say, wait a minute, back up a bit.
[time=2659] You're saying I was at war with God?
[time=2664] Some of you in the room maybe don't understand that or you've never really looked at that or you've never tied that into this discussion of what God did when he saved you.
[time=2677] And I want you to know this morning that the Bible actually says that, it's actually true that we are, God is at war.
[time=2686] We are in our sinfulness, we are in our rebellion,
[time=2692] we are as we choose to stand outside of this saving gospel relationship, the scripture says we're at war.
[time=2701] We could go to a number of places, look at Romans 8-7.
[time=2706] You're gonna write that down, Romans 8-7.
[time=2712] Romans 8-7, it says because the mindset on the flesh, which is where the mind, in the life of someone
[time=2723] who hasn't fully surrendered their heart and life to Christ, that mind isn't set on the spirit, that mind isn't set on Christ, that mind is set on the flesh.
[time=2731] And it says here in Romans 8-7, because the mindset on the flesh is what?
[time=2736] Say it out loud, hostile, hostility.
[time=2741] That word speaks to the issue of enhanced anger, a declaration of war.
[time=2747] This is a hostile environment that is going on between unredeemed man and a holy God.
[time=2756] Hostile toward God, for it does not subject itself to the law of God for it is not even able to do so.
[time=2763] John 3, 36, you go back to the gospel of John, and you see in John 3, 36, the same notion.
[time=2771] It says he who believes in the sun has eternal life.
[time=2776] The gospel comes and saves and redeems, and that individual now has eternal life, but he who does not obey the sun will not see life, but instead will see what?
[time=2788] The wrath of God, and that wrath of God will abide on him because God, my friends, we don't like to talk about it very often, and we certainly kind of cringe at those who only want to talk about it, but the truth of the matter is, and it's important for you to understand this, that God is at war against sin.
[time=2808] God is at war against rebellion and iniquity, and in the end, his wrath will come on those who do not obey the sun.
[time=2821] For they will not see life.
[time=2826] They will see and experience the wrath of God.
[time=2828] Ephesians 5, 6, would you write that down?
[time=2830] Ephesians 5, 6 gives us more insight into this enmity, this strife, this war between a holy God and sinful man.
[time=2839] Let no one deceive you, Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus with empty words for because of these things, the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
[time=2849] There is wrath, there is judgment.
[time=2852] We talked about this, but the first great one author said it this way, I wrote it down, but the first great result of justification is that the sinner's war with God is ended forever.
[time=2866] Did you get that?
[time=2867] The first great result of justification is that the sinner's war with God is ended forever.
[time=2873] Lasting peace, lasting, objective, not subjective.
[time=2881] Not feeling, but spiritual and eternal fact.
[time=2886] Peace, lasting peace now reigns.
[time=2890] I love how Paul said it, turn to Colossians 1 if you would, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians that says in Colossians 1, 21.
[time=2903] Let me invite Corbin and Tanya in the band to come up and would you all just focus in here with me.
[time=2911] Paul writes of this peace, Paul writes of this war
[time=2917] that has now been ceased.
[time=2919] And although you were formerly alienated, and there's that word again, and hostile in mind, even though you and your old life, Second Corinthians 5 says now you have a new life, but in your old life, you were engaged, it says here in Colossians 1, you were engaged in evil deeds, hostile in your mind, engaged in evil deeds, yet he has now reconciled you in his fleshly body through death in order to present you before him, holy, and blameless, and beyond reproach.
[time=2955] What a great truth.
[time=2958] This is how the believer, this is the first of a few things we see here in Romans 5.
[time=2966] The first of several great truths that give you and I great assurance and great security that not only have we been saved by God, but that our faith will be preserved by God.
[time=2978] This peace that he brings, that you and I get to experience in our newfound relationship with him.
[time=2986] Hey, do me a favor and respond to this this morning.
[time=2990] Allow Corbin and Tanya in the band to just lead us in worship, and as you sing this great truth, I want to just encourage you to take note of the great truth that's in this song and the implication of this great truth in your life and mind.
[time=3006] Let's worship him in spirit and in truth together.
[time=3009] (gentle music)
[time=3025] [MUSIC - 257 seconds]
[time=3287] - Hey, let me read this verse to you.
[time=3306] This is the verse that we'll read when we get to the end of Romans 5, 1-11.
[time=3311] And we'll go through that, but I want to just read this to you this morning as it relates to your faith and mind being preserved.
[time=3319] And Jonathan, you can play, it's okay.
[time=3321] It says in Philippians 1-6, think about this.
[time=3326] Paul said, "For I am confident of this very thing, that he who what, that he who began, he and he alone began it." Right?
[time=3340] Faith in Christ, salvation, redemption, only by faith in Christ make possible by God and God alone.
[time=3349] And Paul says, "I'm confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will what, will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus."
[time=3360] You and I cooperate with him.
[time=3363] You and I, it says in this scriptures, work out our salvation and fear and trembling.
[time=3367] That's true, but understand that the one who sees it through, the one who gives it the great assurance that it has is him and him alone.
[time=3377] And that is a great comfort.
[time=3379] That is a great joy for you and I to rest in and to take heart in this morning.
[time=3384] Father God, we stand before you today, a grateful people, many in the room, God that have fully surrendered their hearts and lives to you.
[time=3392] And God today, we've been reminded that what you started, you and you alone will end.
[time=3398] You will grow us and you will perfect us.
[time=3401] And God, you will make us more like your son.
[time=3406] And oh God, I pray that we would be a cooperative people.
[time=3410] That we would be obedient.
[time=3412] God, that we would be consumed with the gospel.
[time=3415] And in being consumed with what's true and right, God yielded in our hearts and spirits, postured towards you in such a way whereby that perfecting process God has made easy.
[time=3427] Joyful, fruitful.
[time=3430] Father, thank you for the privilege that's been ours today.
[time=3433] Hear of what you're doing in the lives of others, God, to look forward to a dinner and a movie
[time=3440] with a spouse, God to worship you in song and God to be able to open our hearts and souls
[time=3446] to the life-changing truth of your scriptures.
[time=3449] God may we leave this place this morning so very encouraged and so very ready and willing
[time=3457] to live righteously because God, you've convinced us again, God, you've shown us again that we are.
[time=3465] And we're righteous because of what you've accomplished through your son.
[time=3469] May we bask in that?
[time=3471] May we be encouraged in that?
[time=3473] And God, may we live in that truth in the days to come.
[time=3477] And all the people in the room agreed and said loudly.
[time=3481] [AMEN]
