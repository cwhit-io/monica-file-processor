[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us.
[time=35] I'm really thankful that you've tuned in today.
[time=37] I can't wait for you to join us as we continue our study in the book of Romans.
[time=42] It has been a great study and I hope it's been as encouraging for you as it has been for me.
[time=48] Let me tell you if I can this morning about two things.
[time=50] Number one, I wanna tell you about a frustration that I've had.
[time=53] That's right, a frustration I've experienced in probably 20 years of ministry.
[time=59] And I also wanna tell you about a solution to this frustration that I feel like we finally put our arms around here in the last couple of weeks.
[time=67] The frustration is this, I have felt for years, frustrated by the fact that we start a conversation on Sunday morning.
[time=76] I've been speaking to church families for years, nine years here at Blackhawk.
[time=80] And for nine years, I have felt often this thing inside me that gets so discouraged because we start to talk about something on a Sunday.
[time=89] We have 40 minutes, which is a decent amount of time, but the fact is even in 40 minutes, there is so much there in God's Word.
[time=97] There is so much for you and I to consider in any given message.
[time=100] There are so many points of application that we could really wrestle with, if you know what I mean.
[time=106] And so I step off the stage every Sunday, feeling the sense of, gosh, I wish we could continue that conversation, but then Sunday's over and Monday comes and we get on with our week and oftentimes by Wednesday, I've forgotten half of what we talked about and you're into your week and so it's just a frustration.
[time=128] What we've done recently, I'm really thankful for it.
[time=131] If you go to our website, to our homepage at blackhawkministries.org, you can see there on the screen that if you just scroll down over on the left-hand side, there's now a new icon, kind of a new link there called digging deeper.
[time=144] And I am so thankful for those who have worked so hard and provide this for you and our Blackhawk family each and every week.
[time=151] You can now go to the digging deeper icon and what you'll see is our best attempt at really continuing the conversation, a chance for you to study further, a chance for you to read and think, a chance for you to be guided by some really well-put-together questions that allow you with the previous week's message in mind, allows you to further apply and further understand and give further thought to the great truth that we talked about that day.
[time=181] I'm so thankful for this tool.
[time=183] And I hope that you as a dad, as you lead your family, I hope you as a small group leader, as you meet with those that you're living in community with.
[time=192] I hope you individually, if this is just a tool that you would benefit from, I hope you'll take advantage of it.
[time=198] We're so thankful that we have this relationship with you and so thankful that we can provide resources like this that will help you in your continued walk with the Lord.
[time=207] Thank you for taking it seriously.
[time=209] Thank you for digging deeper and helping us continue this conversation.
[time=214] The conversation from God's word, God's life-changing, eternity-altering word.
[time=221] We hope it'll be an encouragement to you.
[time=223] God bless you and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=226] [MUSIC - 196 seconds]
[time=433] (audience applauds) - Amen, would you pray with me?
[time=442] Lord God in heaven, we do come before you now.
[time=448] We're so thankful that you hear us.
[time=450] We're so thankful that you watch over us and that you're aware of what's happening in each person's life here in this place and all around the globe at this moment.
[time=459] We stand in awe of your omniscience.
[time=462] And you're on the presence, God.
[time=464] And we do come before you to worship.
[time=466] We know, God, that praise belongs to you.
[time=470] You are the God of the universe, the one who was and is and will forever be and we praise you.
[time=476] God, we also praise you for your great redemption that you offer in the work of your son, Jesus, for the way that you draw us to yourself and unite us through your spirit with each other and most importantly with you.
[time=492] God, we praise you for that gracious act where you transform sinners and enemies into friends and children of the most high God.
[time=504] And like your word says, God will praise you forever.
[time=508] I would love you and ask that you would fix our eyes on Jesus today.
[time=512] We would learn and hear and grow together in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=518] You may be seated.
[time=521] I'm going to invite the greeters forward at this time.
[time=523] And if you've come today prepared to give, we're going to receive those ties and offerings now.
[time=529] (piano music)
[time=538] [MUSIC - 217 seconds]
[time=760] (audience applauding)
[time=770] (piano music)
[time=785] (piano music) - I am extremely thankful and excited
[time=798] about our morning today and our chance to jump back into our study of doctrine from the Book of Romans.
[time=806] Why disciples need doctrine?
[time=809] It's been several weeks and I wanna jump back in this morning where we left off a couple of weeks ago.
[time=815] But before I do that let me just tell you about a new feature, a new tool, a new resource if you will on our website.
[time=823] Some of you know about this.
[time=824] I wrote you in one of my recent emails about this.
[time=828] It's a little icon you can click on, about halfway down our homepage on the left-hand side.
[time=833] It's labeled digging deeper.
[time=836] And I gotta tell you this, for years and years, you know, I've been speaking and trying my best with God's help to teach the Bible for probably over 21, 22 years.
[time=845] There has always been a frustration that I've experienced in any setting because in any setting, much like this one on a Sunday morning, as thankful as I am for the 40 minutes or so, I always step off this platform feeling in my heart as if, you know, there was so much there I wish they could have seen, so much more I wish they could have heard.
[time=867] So many more places we could have gone.
[time=870] Things that would encourage them and things that could help them.
[time=873] And so I'm just grateful as can be for this resource that our teams put together.
[time=878] Tom Beckner's been helping us with this.
[time=880] Others will help him with this and the days to come.
[time=884] But it's just a resource you click on there and it takes you literally to just a study guide, a series of questions and opportunities for you to further the discussion that we begin on Sunday mornings.
[time=898] And wherever we leave off on Sunday, you can go to that link probably by Tuesday or Wednesday.
[time=903] It'll be ready each week.
[time=905] You can download it, use it for yourself and your own study.
[time=907] You can use it for your small group, the community that you're a part of, the smaller setting that you're engaged in.
[time=913] You can use it in that setting.
[time=915] You could use it with your wife, with your older kids.
[time=918] As a family, you could kind of dive in on that.
[time=920] It's a great document.
[time=922] Gives you opportunity to study more, think more, apply more of the truths that we just get into on a Sunday morning.
[time=930] So take advantage of that digging deeper.
[time=932] It's on our website and I'm really, really thankful.
[time=934] Well, hey, open your Bibles to Romans chapter five, if you will.
[time=939] We're gonna go back to where we left off in Romans five and we will continue on this morning to Romans six, but I wanna review quickly and take you back to where we left off.
[time=949] And where we left off was we were asking the question that is posed at the beginning of Romans five.
[time=955] How do we know God and God alone will preserve our faith?
[time=961] How do we know that God and God alone?
[time=963] We said this two weeks ago that there were some, many in Paul's day who had come to the place where they were willing, freely willing to accept the fact that salvation, the act of it, the bringing of it was completely and absolutely of God and God alone, okay, we buy that, they said.
[time=979] But then there were some who felt as if surely it was upon them and some effort that they might make to preserve that faith, to see that faith through.
[time=990] When Paul says, no, no, not at all, to the contrary, even the preserving of the faith is an act of God.
[time=997] How can we know for sure the text basically asks the question there in Romans five that God will preserve our faith that he will see us through till the end?
[time=1009] How can we believe this to be true?
[time=1011] Well, because Scripture says so.
[time=1013] And specifically, Scripture says so right here in Romans five, one through 11.
[time=1019] How can the follower of Christ know for sure that God and God alone has secured his or her faith for all time?
[time=1029] Romans five, one to 11.
[time=1031] In honor of God's word, would you stand?
[time=1033] And let me just kind of reacquaint ourselves with this passage.
[time=1037] Says therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our introduction, our introduction to God by faith into this grace in which we stand.
[time=1056] And we exalt in hope, hope of the glory of God.
[time=1060] And not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance and perseverance brings about proven character and proven character, hope and hope.
[time=1073] Hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[time=1082] For while we were still helpless at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[time=1087] For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man, someone would dare even to die.
[time=1093] But God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet, what?
[time=1102] Sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=1106] Much more than having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him.
[time=1115] For if while we were what?
[time=1118] Enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his son much more now.
[time=1124] Having been reconciled, we shall be what?
[time=1129] Saved by his life.
[time=1131] And not only this, but we also exalt in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
[time=1141] Pray with me, would you Father God, we come before you this morning hungry in our hearts and wanting to learn more of you, wanting to understand and grasp.
[time=1152] As we've said in weeks gone by the deep truth, the deep and profound truth about you.
[time=1158] God, as we look into this doctrine today, may we bridge the gap, may your Holy Spirit in us bridge the gap between the great truth about you and the way in which we live, God.
[time=1172] The choices we make, the thoughts that we think, God, may we today as we open our hearts and our lives and our minds to your word.
[time=1183] May we be grown and stretched and convicted and encouraged as we do so.
[time=1190] Father, thank you for the privilege of gathering.
[time=1193] We mean that.
[time=1194] We don't take this for granted.
[time=1195] May this be a time dedicated and set apart to you.
[time=1199] May you be honored.
[time=1200] May your word and your truth be lifted up and may we be changed in the process and all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=1208] You can be seated.
[time=1209] Well, we asked the question the last time we were together.
[time=1214] How do we know God will preserve our faith?
[time=1216] Five things for you this morning.
[time=1218] We got through, I think the first one, maybe the first and second one, but let's just review quickly.
[time=1223] First of all, the follower of Christ, the individual who has fully surrendered his or her heart to Christ knows for sure that their faith will be preserved because that person knows he has peace with God.
[time=1240] You see it there on the screen because of his peace with God.
[time=1243] You see it there in five.
[time=1245] One, therefore, having been justified by faith.
[time=1248] We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1253] You'll remember quickly, I'll remind you, this peace that we have with God that brings such security and trust that our faith will be preserved.
[time=1260] This peace that we have with him is not subjective.
[time=1264] It's not the peace that our relationship has.
[time=1268] It's not the peace guys that you have this morning having executed a very successful Valentine's night last night.
[time=1275] It's not the peace that you're lacking today if you didn't execute Valentine successfully.
[time=1281] This peace is not a subjective thing that's able to be swung over here and swung over there.
[time=1288] This isn't a peace that comes with feelings.
[time=1290] This isn't a peace that comes with difficult or good circumstances.
[time=1294] This peace, the peace that we have with God is a fixed peace.
[time=1300] It is once and for all set in stone.
[time=1303] It is immovable, it is unshakable.
[time=1306] We have and we will forever have peace with God because of what you did?
[time=1313] No, but because of what he did.
[time=1316] Because he redeemed you, because he saved you, because he forgave you, we have peace.
[time=1322] And because of that peace, we can rest assured.
[time=1324] We can be secure in the fact that he will preserve our faith.
[time=1331] Secondly, our standing in God's grace.
[time=1334] How can we have this faith?
[time=1336] And how can we have this security?
[time=1338] Well, the follower of Christ can have this because of his standing, because of her standing in God's grace.
[time=1346] Interesting phrase, you see it there in verse two of chapter five.
[time=1350] Our Lord Jesus Christ, end of one, beginning of two, through whom also, we have obtained our introduction
[time=1359] to God by faith into this grace in which we stand, into this grace in which we stand.
[time=1372] The believer's standing has been changed.
[time=1377] It's an interesting word.
[time=1380] In the Greek it means standing, the grace in which we stand.
[time=1386] In the Greek it has to do with a permanent key word there.
[time=1390] As we think about the preservation of our faith, it means the permanent and secure posture of the new man.
[time=1397] Maybe you understand this.
[time=1401] I know I do, I have seen people.
[time=1404] In years and years of life and ministry who didn't know him, who weren't walking with him, who hadn't fully surrendered their heart and life to him, there is a way in which they, there is a way in which I stood.
[time=1418] There was a posture that we had when we were opposed to God, when we were separated from God.
[time=1427] It's just clear, you can just see it.
[time=1429] And then the great redeeming power of God comes.
[time=1433] This great divine redemption takes place and he draws you to himself and you fully surrender your heart and life to Christ and there is a standing, there is a posture.
[time=1444] The word has to do with one spiritual posture and it changes.
[time=1448] Have you seen that?
[time=1450] I have.
[time=1452] One's whole countenance changes.
[time=1454] Humility begins to trump pride.
[time=1456] There's a gentleness, there's just a different spirit.
[time=1459] This is the grace in which we stand that Paul refers to.
[time=1465] We can have great faith in the fact that God will preserve our faith because of the peace that we have, because of the grace in which we stand.
[time=1475] You can look on the screen there thirdly because of the hope, because of the hope of glory.
[time=1482] It says there in verse two, through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand and we exalt now in that new standing with that new posture, having been redeemed, we exalt.
[time=1496] We are excited, we make much of, we lift up hope.
[time=1501] We exalt in hope.
[time=1504] Here, hope refers to that which is going to take place that day, that time when we will be with him, basking in, what's the text say there?
[time=1512] The glory of God.
[time=1515] We exalt in hope.
[time=1518] Now, I wanna read this to you, just from the notes in my own Bible here where it talks about this hope in verse two.
[time=1525] It says the hope used here, the Greek word for hope, unlike the English word for hope, the New Testament word contains no uncertainty.
[time=1535] Did you catch that?
[time=1537] None.
[time=1539] It speaks of something that is certain, but not yet realized.
[time=1543] The believer's ultimate destiny is to share in the very glory of God and that hope will be realized.
[time=1552] It's not up for grabs, it's not up for debate, it's not a maybe, it's not a what if.
[time=1558] That hope will be realized because Christ himself secures it.
[time=1563] Without the clear and certain promises of the word of God, the believer would have no basis for hope, but the promises of the word of God are clear.
[time=1575] Christ has secured that you and I will be with God.
[time=1579] We will be basking someday in the glory of his presence and that is a hope which is fixed.
[time=1587] It's not a I hope the weather gets better.
[time=1589] It's not a I hope lunch goes well today.
[time=1594] Things that are subject to all kinds of things interfering and ruining and altering no.
[time=1600] This is a hope my friends that we have and it is fixed, it's going to happen.
[time=1605] The believer can have great faith and great trust in the preservation of his or her faith because of the peace we have with God, the standing in God's grace, the hope that is ours, the divine love, think about it.
[time=1617] Think about the level of love, the depth of love that you and I have received.
[time=1624] You see it there at the end of five and hope does not disappoint.
[time=1628] How do we know this?
[time=1630] Because the love of God, there it is.
[time=1632] The love of God has been poured out.
[time=1636] He didn't sprinkle it on you.
[time=1638] He didn't just give you a portion.
[time=1640] No, the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[time=1646] How much love you say, what level of love?
[time=1650] How far did he go in bestowing this love?
[time=1654] I mean, because if he went a long way, I mean, if it's a lot of love, then there's this even greater sense of security and trust that this faith will be preserved, that we will be held for all of eternity.
[time=1667] For while we were, how much love?
[time=1669] Here you go, for while we were still helpless.
[time=1672] At the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[time=1676] In verse eight, but God demonstrates his own love, his own love toward us, and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=1689] The fact that we have peace, the fact that we stand in this new place of God's grace, the fact that we have hoped, the fact that God's poured out and continues to pour out his love on us, all of this gives us great confidence that God and God alone will preserve our faith.
[time=1706] Lastly, you can see it there, the escape of divine wrath.
[time=1709] This is the last reason here in chapter five,
[time=1715] verses one to 11, the last reason given, a reason that allows you and I, great confidence and great security in the fact that he will preserve our faith because he says that if you know him, you have escaped the wrath.
[time=1733] The wrath of God, we started this whole series back in Romans one talking about how the wrath of God is being revealed and it will be revealed against all sinfulness and ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[time=1747] And then you read here in chapter five, praise God, we can read this much more than, verse nine, much more than having now been justified by his blood, we shall be what?
[time=1761] Saved from the what?
[time=1763] From the wrath of God through him, who's him?
[time=1765] Christ, from the wrath of God through him.
[time=1769] All of this made possible because we are now in Christ.
[time=1778] Literally, because we are now in Christ, what Christ has accomplished is ours through Christ we have been, remember, very important here.
[time=1788] Through Christ we have been reconciled to God.
[time=1793] Go back to five, 10.
[time=1796] For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his son, much more now having been reconciled, there's that word again, we shall be saved by his life.
[time=1809] And not only this, but we also exalt in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received the what?
[time=1816] There's that word again, the reconciliation.
[time=1819] We have been reconciled, we talked about this a few weeks ago, do you remember to be reconciled assumes that there's been a what?
[time=1827] To be reconciled assumes that there's been a break, there's been a breach, there's been a breaking of relationship.
[time=1833] We talked about how prior to knowing the Lord, prior to being redeemed, the scripture says that we were hostile, remember?
[time=1843] We talked about how we were enemies of God.
[time=1845] We were opposed to him and he was opposed to us.
[time=1848] There was this great chasm between us.
[time=1851] And Christ comes and he reconciles that relationship.
[time=1856] He brings it back to health.
[time=1858] He reunites it so that there can be intimacy with God.
[time=1863] You ask, well, when did we become hostile?
[time=1867] When did we become fractured?
[time=1869] When did that relationship become so severed and distant?
[time=1873] Well, we talked about that.
[time=1875] Just a couple of weeks ago here in Romans 5, chapter five reminds us that that hostility, that distance between man and God, came through the sin of a man and a woman, way back at the very beginning of all this, his name was what?
[time=1892] Her name was what?
[time=1894] Eve.
[time=1895] Through the sin of Adam, and you can read about that in chapter five here, verses 12 to 21.
[time=1902] Through the sin of Adam, the relationship with God had been broken and severed.
[time=1908] But through the gospel, remember the gospel?
[time=1910] Gospel means the what?
[time=1912] The good news.
[time=1913] But through the gospel, through the work of Christ, that relationship is now reconciled and restored.
[time=1919] Listen, I want you to see this.
[time=1921] I want you to see this amazing summary at the end of chapter five.
[time=1925] It literally kind of just, I was reading it this week and I went, wow, that's everything we've studied.
[time=1931] That's everything we've talked about so far.
[time=1934] End of chapter five, verses 18 to 21, you'll even pick up on the verbiage and the words that we've been using, the doctrines we've been studying.
[time=1943] Here we go, Romans 5, 18.
[time=1944] So then, as through one transgression, Adam, their resulted condemnation to all men, you and me,
[time=1956] and even so through one act of righteousness, Christ and the cross, their resulted justification of life to all men.
[time=1967] For as through the one man's disobedience, the many were made sinners, that's you and me, even so through the obedience of the one, Jesus, the many will be made what?
[time=1979] Righteous.
[time=1980] The law came in so that the transgression would increase,
[time=1986] but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.
[time=1990] The law comes into an essence show, our absolute inadequacy, our inability.
[time=1996] We were never gonna live up to that standard.
[time=1998] We could never keep all the rules.
[time=2000] We were never gonna be able to morally or personally or relationally, kind of just check all those things off.
[time=2007] The law exposes man's sinfulness,
[time=2013] but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more so that as sin reigned in death, even so, what grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[time=2029] So I want you to sense something.
[time=2030] I want you to hear something in those words.
[time=2033] And it's very true, grace, grace now rules.
[time=2041] Paul now begins to shift as he comes to the end of chapter five and he begins to introduce to you and I this concept of grace, the unmerited favor of God, graciously given and graciously bestowed on undeserving people like you and me.
[time=2059] Grace, hear me, grace reigns, grace rules.
[time=2063] Grace now moves to the forefront of the conversation.
[time=2067] The dominant theme becomes grace, grace, grace, grace.
[time=2070] At the end of chapter five, the grace of God becomes the focal point now of Paul's letter to the church at Rome.
[time=2078] And now watch this.
[time=2080] And Paul, in just a brilliant way that Paul does this, he anticipates what his fellow countrymen might think.
[time=2089] He anticipates what the human mind will conjure up.
[time=2093] He anticipates the temptation of the evil one to take this message, what message?
[time=2099] Watch the message that the wrath of God is going to be revealed, chapter one.
[time=2106] The message that man is sinful and do the consequences of that wrath, the immoral man of chapter one and the moral man of chapter two and the immoral man of chapter one and the moral man of chapter two, let us to chapter three where he asked the question, is there anybody out there righteous?
[time=2128] And the answer was what?
[time=2130] No, we're all in trouble.
[time=2132] And then we move to chapter four where we understand and begin to see this great truth of justification where God sees us in this place of having nowhere to go and nowhere to turn.
[time=2144] And in chapter four, God, he gives us the example of Abraham, how Abraham was justified because he believed, he believed and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.
[time=2155] He didn't do the law, he didn't keep all the mandates, no, Abraham, the word says there in Romans four believed and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.
[time=2165] And we come to chapter five, which we just looked at and that faith is preserved and we're reconciled, we had been distanced by Adam but now we're brought close by God and we're now at the end of five able to just live in this grace.
[time=2181] And Paul says, okay, I know what you're thinking.
[time=2188] Probably because he had thought it himself.
[time=2191] I know I have and we all just need to take a moment here
[time=2198] and put on our honest hats.
[time=2201] Let's all just be really genuine and real.
[time=2204] And let's just marvel at the insight of Paul and the spirit of God as he moves Paul to write this because what Paul says next is really insightful and very important for us to consider.
[time=2217] First verse, chapter six, what shall we say then?
[time=2222] Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?
[time=2230] Now the honest truth is that if you're here today
[time=2243] and you know the Lord and maybe you've been walking with him for a few months or maybe you've been walking with him for a few decades but you and I have been tempted to think this, haven't we?
[time=2256] You and I have been tempted to because we know everything
[time=2262] we just said, because we know the story of Romans one, two, three, four and five.
[time=2269] There is this temptation in us to just kind of sit back and say to ourselves, you know what?
[time=2277] I'm good.
[time=2278] He's got me, he's got me covered.
[time=2283] He's forgiven everything past, present and future.
[time=2289] He's never gonna leave me, he's never gonna forsake me and I just got done being convinced of the fact that he's going to secure my salvation from here on out.
[time=2299] So why don't I just go ahead and do it?
[time=2306] And these are moment by moment conversations and then these are bigger, broader conversations but you and I both know that there are these times where we are tempted to abuse what?
[time=2318] Grace.
[time=2319] My sin's been covered, grace reigns, so why not just go ahead?
[time=2326] Well, what Paul unveils for us next, exposes and reveals that that line of thinking couldn't be further from the heart of God and most of you in the room know that.
[time=2340] But what we forget at times is that while it couldn't be further from the heart of God, it couldn't be further from the spiritual reality, from the spiritual resources, from the spiritual truth that is present in the heart and life of one who has been made righteous, been saved, one who has embraced the gospel.
[time=2366] This isn't how it has to go.
[time=2368] You do have a choice to make and as someone who has been redeemed by the love of God, you and I can move in a different direction than that temptation in which the evil one brings to abuse grace.
[time=2382] Watch this, verse two, Paul says to his own question, it's an honest, authentic question and Paul says, may, I don't know how your translation reads, most of them are along these lines, may it never be.
[time=2398] And in my text here, I don't have a period, I have a what, I have an exclamation point.
[time=2404] May it never be, he says in the Greek, the phrase in the Greek would have been the single most emphatic or strongest way known in the Greek language to say, absolutely not.
[time=2422] Don't go there, don't think that.
[time=2425] Certainly, oh, my friend, he says, don't act on that.
[time=2429] No, no, no, no.
[time=2431] How many different ways can I say it, send more to get more grace?
[time=2435] No, may it never be absolutely not.
[time=2438] The Greek phrase actually carried with it a tone of outrage and anger that this might ever be suggested.
[time=2446] So what's so wrong with the idea of sending more, knowing you'll get more grace.
[time=2453] What's so wrong with abusing the grace of God while my friends, what we're about to see is that it goes against the very foundations of the all-important doctrine of salvation, of sanctification, excuse me.
[time=2470] We come to a new doctrine here in our study at this point in Romans, the all-important doctrine of sanctification.
[time=2479] Come this morning to a new doctrinal truth, a new theological principle, if you will, that carries with it, as all doctrine and theology do, huge and very practical, helpful, personal application for you and for me.
[time=2495] As we come to chapter six in our study of doctrine from the book of Romans, Paul now moves on from the great doctrine of justification and the declaring of righteous, those who are his, to the doctrine of sanctification that may be a new word to you.
[time=2512] This may be a new concept for others of you.
[time=2515] This may be great review.
[time=2517] But let me just remind us how we got here.
[time=2519] In our first section, we looked at the doctrine of condemnation and man's need for the righteousness of God.
[time=2526] We saw that need as we kind of dug into the reality in the depths of man's depravity.
[time=2533] Man's moral depravity and man's immoral depravity.
[time=2538] In our second section, we looked at the doctrine of justification and how that righteousness that we so needed was delivered by God.
[time=2549] It was imputed into man through the work and the person of Christ.
[time=2554] And now in this third section of Romans, chapters six through eight, make note of that.
[time=2559] Chapters six through eight, third section, we see Paul describing the living out.
[time=2565] Are you with me?
[time=2566] The living out of that righteousness.
[time=2568] The righteousness of God gets imputed into man.
[time=2571] It gets delivered into the soul of man, a man who desperately needed that righteousness.
[time=2577] Now we come to this third doctrine of sanctification and we see now how that righteousness is gonna get lived out in the everyday of life.
[time=2586] It's called my friends, sanctification.
[time=2589] Sanctification.
[time=2592] Before we jump into Romans six, let's just establish a working definition of what sanctification means.
[time=2599] Very important here.
[time=2600] Please don't miss this.
[time=2603] If you haven't been writing, I hope you'll write now.
[time=2605] Just jot this down.
[time=2607] A working definition of what it means to be sanctified.
[time=2611] Let's go back and look at our working definitions that we've been functioning from.
[time=2615] Condemnation, the doctrine of condemnation meant the rightful consequence due to those separated from God by the presence of sin.
[time=2625] The doctrine of justification meant to be declared by God as righteous, not just not guilty, but no.
[time=2632] Now declared righteous, a complete reclassification at the soul level of one standing with God and now we come to sanctification.
[time=2643] Sanctification, write this down.
[time=2645] The process by which, very important word there, process.
[time=2650] The process by which a believer, somebody who has fully surrendered their heart and life to Christ, somebody who has been redeemed, somebody who has embraced the gospel.
[time=2662] The process by which a believer is over time conformed.
[time=2668] It's a powerful word.
[time=2672] The word conformed, it's got broad meaning in that it can mean, it can mean at times, the gentle nudge that God gives you in this process.
[time=2682] Raise your hand if you've been gently nudged by God at times as he's grown you.
[time=2688] And it also means, it also means the back of the head that God gives sometimes, that sharp aggressive molding and shaping and redirecting that he sometimes gives.
[time=2701] Raise your hand if you've been whacked on the back of the head at times by God's loving hand, absolutely.
[time=2707] The process by which a believer is over time conformed into the very image of who.
[time=2715] This is important to just say this today.
[time=2717] It's important for us to be reminded of this today.
[time=2720] You're being conformed to the image of who?
[time=2722] Not me, not your idol.
[time=2731] Not your mentor, not the one who discipled you.
[time=2734] Although we're thankful for these people and the process of sanctification.
[time=2738] You're being molded, you're being shaped, you're being nudged and aggressively molded into the image of Christ himself.
[time=2750] How does this happen, you ask?
[time=2754] I wanna go through that.
[time=2756] I wanna experience that.
[time=2758] How does one practically experience the process of sanctification by virtue of there?
[time=2764] Here you go, two things, by virtue of their obedience to the word of God, their obedience to God's word and be by virtue of their submission to the Holy Spirit.
[time=2776] When you're willing in your life, when I'm willing in mind, when we're willing to each and every moment, when we're willing each and every day, when there is a consistent posture with you and me where we say, okay, Holy Spirit, today I wanna go, where you want me to go, I wanna say what you want me to say, I wanna love in the way you want to empower me to love, Holy Spirit, move me, Holy Spirit, nudge me, Holy Spirit, convict me, I want to respond to you when you live in submission to the Spirit of God.
[time=2810] And when you live in obedience to the word of God, so that means you gotta read it and you gotta understand it and you gotta be in community with those who are gonna help you read it and understand it and apply it, not just being here as but doers of the word.
[time=2828] When the word of God is followed and the Spirit of God is submitted to you and I get sanctified, sanctification.
[time=2844] Why did Paul feel as if, why did Paul feel as if the thought of sinning more to get more grace was so spiritually absurd?
[time=2855] Well, he shows you right here, this is powerful, my friends.
[time=2860] This is really, really amazing stuff that we're about to see and we're gonna look at it, we're gonna look at it quickly and we'll come back to it in the days to come but I want you to see this this morning.
[time=2870] Paul knew, here's why Paul felt as if it was so absurd.
[time=2874] Here's why it concerned Paul so much, this is why Paul said, "May it never be that you and I would abuse grace "because Paul knew that positionally, "would you write that word down?
[time=2884] "Because Paul knew that positionally "as believers we are dead to sin." Paul understood this, you say, how did Paul understand this?
[time=2893] What do you mean?
[time=2894] Let me read it to you, verse three, Romans six, three.
[time=2897] Or do you, how shall we who died to sin still live in it?
[time=2902] End of verse two.
[time=2904] How do you die to something and still live in it?
[time=2907] The contrast of the two words is amazing, death and life.
[time=2911] They don't go together.
[time=2913] Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
[time=2921] Therefore we have been buried with Him, did you know you were in the tomb?
[time=2926] With Him positionally you were.
[time=2929] You were buried with Him through baptism into death so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, you were with Him there as well positionally.
[time=2941] So we too, you and me in knowing Him might walk in newness of life.
[time=2948] For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, which we were, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this that our old self was crucified with Him.
[time=2964] Our old selves, dead with Him in order that our body of sin might be done away with.
[time=2971] The phrase there in the Greek had to do with what they would do with refuse, what they would do with garbage, and they would toss it out, it would be burned, it would be disintegrated and done away with.
[time=2982] Our body of sin might be tossed out with the trash so that we would no longer be what?
[time=2990] Slaves to sin.
[time=2992] For He who has died is what?
[time=2996] Freed from sin.
[time=2999] Now if we've died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again.
[time=3007] Death no longer is master over Him.
[time=3010] For the death that He died, He died to sin once and for all.
[time=3015] But the life that He lives, He lives to God.
[time=3019] Even so, here you go.
[time=3022] Paul says, "Even so, consider the deep word that has to do with your thought and what you hang on to and what resides at the soul of your mind and your thinking.
[time=3037] Even so, consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus." Positionally, now listen, positionally, Paul knew we are dead to sin.
[time=3052] Positionally is like what God, it's God's part of this redemptive equation.
[time=3059] It's what He's done that has real, real effect on you.
[time=3066] One of the closest things I can think of is adoption.
[time=3071] Many of you in the room, you have friends or family members who have adopted somebody.
[time=3077] Maybe you've adopted a little one at some point in time.
[time=3080] I've spent some time in recent years in an orphanage in Nairobi.
[time=3084] I've become more and more familiar with this concept but this picture of adoption.
[time=3090] And oftentimes what happens is generally speaking, right track with me here, generally speaking in these circumstances, there is a reality here where a baby's born
[time=3101] and there's something that's gone on.
[time=3104] There's a series of circumstances and we don't need to get into details.
[time=3108] They're not always the same, but this has happened or this has happened or this has happened and then there's this little one and then there's this willingness for that little one to be given to someone else, someone else who would what?
[time=3120] Someone else who would adopt this little one into a new set of circumstances,
[time=3126] circumstances that might be different, circumstances that might be healthier.
[time=3132] The position, we've got some friends, just in recent weeks, some friends of ours,
[time=3139] the names are Matt and Abby.
[time=3141] In the last couple of weeks, they've received a little baby girl named Hannah
[time=3147] just about two weeks ago, just newly born.
[time=3150] I mean, they were on the list and they thought it was going to happen in a year or so and boom, one Friday afternoon or Thursday night they got a call and the next day they had her.
[time=3159] And the position of little Hannah is that she's now Matt and Abby's.
[time=3167] Do you understand that?
[time=3168] She's Matt and Abby's and she's going to grow up with Matt and Abby and they're going to feed her and they're going to take care of her and they're going to invest in her.
[time=3177] And yes, there was a reality over here and it was what it was.
[time=3181] But the fact is that positionally she is theirs.
[time=3188] You with me?
[time=3189] Positionally, you are his and positionally because of what he's done.
[time=3197] You are not, could be, might be sort of sort of kind of maybe.
[time=3202] No, positionally, you're dead to sin.
[time=3208] Dead to sin.
[time=3209] It's an amazing thought.
[time=3212] What does this mean?
[time=3213] It means practically now, positionally, what he did brings this to this place of adoption, brings this to this place where our reality is completely different no matter what happened over here and what does it mean?
[time=3224] It means practically we can now present our bodies not to sin and lust but to righteousness,
[time=3231] not to sin and lust but to righteousness.
[time=3236] Look at what it says there in verse 12.
[time=3237] Where do I get this?
[time=3238] Well, I get it right here in our text.
[time=3240] Therefore, do not let sin.
[time=3241] Now watch how the language shifts.
[time=3243] We've been talking, we've been talking for chapters about what he did, about what he has
[time=3250] secured, about his part and his role and it's huge.
[time=3254] But now look at what it says in verse 12.
[time=3256] Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body.
[time=3261] Who's he talking to?
[time=3263] You.
[time=3264] He's talking to me.
[time=3266] Don't let it reign.
[time=3268] You don't let it reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts and you don't go
[time=3275] on presenting the members of your body to sin as if the members of your body were instruments
[time=3283] of unrighteousness.
[time=3284] Don't do that.
[time=3286] But you present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead and your members as instruments,
[time=3295] your eyes and your mouth and your feet and your hands and what you do and where you walk
[time=3301] and the things you look at and the stuff that you say, instruments, the members of your
[time=3307] body instruments of righteousness.
[time=3310] That word present, it was three or four times there in just those few verses.
[time=3315] The Greek word for present refers to a choice, a decision of the will.
[time=3321] Through salvation, my will has been radically altered.
[time=3325] What I truly desire, what I long for.
[time=3328] He says choose in that direction.
[time=3331] Now listen, I'm going to ask the guys if they would to bring in the cup and the bread for
[time=3337] communion.
[time=3338] We're going to take it here in just a moment.
[time=3339] I want to ask Corbin and the team to come on back up.
[time=3341] But let me read this to you as they come.
[time=3343] With respect, listen.
[time=3346] With respect to its ability and power to dominate and control me, sin is dead.
[time=3354] Can I hear an amen?
[time=3356] It may, it may listen.
[time=3358] It may war with me from time to time.
[time=3362] It may war with me from day to day, but as a redeemed biblical Christian who's dead to sin,
[time=3371] I now have the power and I now have been given the spiritual capacity to steer my body and
[time=3378] its members with help from the Spirit of God and the Word of God away from sin.
[time=3385] He says, hey, you, do it.
[time=3389] Don't let sin reign.
[time=3390] You're dead to it, even though it's going to war with you and even though that battle is going to be fierce.
[time=3397] You don't want your eyes to look at that.
[time=3400] So you present, you will them.
[time=3404] You present your eyes elsewhere to look at what's good.
[time=3408] You don't want to, you don't want your mouth to say things to that coworker, things that you know will lead to compromise and sin.
[time=3416] So you, because you have the spiritual power to do so, keep your mouth shut and refuse to
[time=3423] speak the provocative word.
[time=3427] You don't make that phone call that you shouldn't make with your fingers.
[time=3432] You literally don't walk with your feet into that establishment anymore where sin and death
[time=3438] and destruction await you.
[time=3441] You don't dress inappropriately in an effort to show off the members of your body.
[time=3447] You don't flirt with your eyes.
[time=3449] You don't slap a credit card down with your hands when you don't have the money to pay for it.
[time=3456] We no longer present our body parts to sin because sin's power and sin's persuasion is dead.
[time=3467] And that sounds like a steep task, I know.
[time=3471] And that's why we can't do this alone.
[time=3473] That's why I need you and you need me.
[time=3476] We desperately need each other and we need the Word of God and the Spirit of God.
[time=3481] And in that place He sanctifies us.
[time=3506] [MUSIC]
