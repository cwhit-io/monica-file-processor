[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Hi everyone, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] We're so thankful that you've tuned in and I'm so grateful to have this chance this morning to share with you from our ongoing study of doctrine from the Book of Romans.
[time=44] It has been an amazing study for us and the family here at Blackhawk, and I know for many of you who are watching via the broadcast, and we come today to a chapter that is absolutely packed with life-changing truth, really, hope-giving truth.
[time=59] And I want to just say one thing to you before we jump into the message today.
[time=62] One thing that I want you to kind of just latch onto and focus on as we jump into this passage, and that one thing is this.
[time=70] In your spiritual journey, yours, whoever you are, if you're someone out there this morning and you've surrendered your heart and life to Jesus Christ, you have bowed the knee of your heart.
[time=82] You are one who is genuinely, not perfectly, but genuinely and authentically, giving yourself to a life of following Christ.
[time=91] If you know the Lord, then the one thing I want you to realize today from Romans chapter eight is that you are not alone.
[time=100] That's right, I know personally from my own struggles and my own journey, and I know from the things I hear you say and the things that I hear from people each and every day who are in this same journey you and I are in, I know there are times where we feel so desperately alone.
[time=118] I know there are times when the confusion of sin.
[time=122] I know there are times when the difficulty of the temptation that sin brings.
[time=126] I know there are times in the difficult parts of life where you and I feel like we're out there slugging it out all by ourselves.
[time=134] And the fact of the matter is that Romans eight reminds us that in this sanctification process that God has us in as he conforms us to the image of his son.
[time=146] We talked about that in our definition of sanctification.
[time=150] In the midst of this life that we live, this spiritual life where he grows us and shapes us, I want you to know this morning you're not alone.
[time=160] There is the amazing gift that God gives.
[time=163] It's called the spirit of God and I want you to see this morning as we go through Romans eight, the presence of the spirit of God and the role he plays in your life and mind.
[time=173] I want it to be an encouragement to you.
[time=175] I want you to feel inspired.
[time=176] I want you most of all to feel loved by a God who wouldn't leave you by yourself, but who promises in Philippians one six to finish what he began and that finishing agent we'll see today is none other than the Holy Spirit of God himself.
[time=193] What a gift the spirit of God is and what an amazing task he has to accomplish growing you and being in our faith.
[time=201] And we know because God's word says it's true that he will do that perfectly and completely as the days go by.
[time=208] Thank you so much for tuning in and I hope this morning your heart will be encouraged as you follow us in our study from the book of Romans.
[time=216] [MUSIC - 258 seconds]
[time=479] (audience applauds) - Amen.
[time=488] Would you pray with me?
[time=490] God, we celebrate together this morning, your grace and your great work of atonement and salvation offered to us by way of Jesus.
[time=499] We pray God that by no means would we consider sinning more so that your grace would increase, but God that we would live lives of repentance, turning away from sin and the error that your Scripture outlines, and that we would run toward grace and righteousness and holiness.
[time=516] God, we ask that you would just saturate our lives and souls with this truth of grace and your word.
[time=525] In particular, this great truth that we find in Romans, and as we learn and grow and experience that together, be blessed and may it multiply.
[time=534] The truth of the Scripture may be multiplied in each of our lives as we, through the help of your Holy Spirit, live out that truth in this reclassification of our souls.
[time=544] We ask it in the name of your gracious Son, Jesus.
[time=548] [AMEN] - This morning, we kick off what we are calling the preparation.
[time=555] The preparation is something that we tried last year, and we were so blessed by what God did in all of us in the midst of that.
[time=563] It's a six week kind of preparing our hearts and minds and bodies, our lives, maybe even our homes and relationships.
[time=573] It's a six week really concentrated and focused effort on our part to prepare ourselves for the greatest day in all of history and the greatest celebration that we as believers have the privilege of celebrating that being Resurrection Sunday.
[time=590] - Well, hey, this morning, we begin to follow Jesus in the preparation.
[time=595] And this morning, as you pick up your books on the way out, and as you read this week, we will be following him to the temple.
[time=602] And so I want to just direct your attention here to the stage this morning as we get a glimpse into what that may have been like.
[time=609] - Yes, baby, I know you're tired and hungry.
[time=612] Why don't we rest a while?
[time=615] You can lie down and I'll get you some bread and water.
[time=618] Benjamin, we need to rest a while.
[time=620] Ruthie is tired.
[time=622] You'll have to excuse her.
[time=624] We've been traveling for eight days now.
[time=626] We still have three more to go and run our last loaves of bread.
[time=630] It's been quite a journey.
[time=632] Her first to the holy city.
[time=634] We were supposed to go there to take part in the Passover celebration, but things don't always turn out the way they're supposed to now, do they?
[time=642] You see, it all started last spring.
[time=646] My husband Benjamin had decided that this was a year that we would finally travel to Jerusalem for the Passover feast.
[time=653] It had been a good year, and we'd never had enough money before, but we had more lambs than ever before.
[time=658] And my youngest son, Jacob, was finally old enough to help with the flocks, so Benjamin knew he'd have five boys to help him.
[time=665] Ruthie here is the only girl, so she stays home with me.
[time=670] But Benjamin had a job for her to do.
[time=673] She was to take care of the unblemished one.
[time=676] Oh, and that he was a perfect lamb.
[time=680] He was the firstborn to his mother.
[time=682] He had no spots, no markings.
[time=684] He was healthy and full of life.
[time=688] She fed him milk from a ladle until he was old enough to drink from a bowl.
[time=692] She named him Little Enoch.
[time=694] Oh, and he was so smart, too.
[time=696] He could find her anywhere in the courtyard, and he knew never to get into my garden.
[time=701] He even came when she called his name.
[time=704] And he had these clear eyes and soft wool, little black shiny hooves.
[time=710] He was perfect.
[time=715] The perfect lamb for the Passover sacrifice.
[time=718] I thought it might be difficult for her to see her pet taken away to,
[time=726] well, you know.
[time=728] But Ruthie understood.
[time=730] She knew what a sacrifice this journey was for our family.
[time=734] It was her contribution to the festival, to our family, to God.
[time=739] It was a joy for her to do as her father had asked her to.
[time=744] So eight days ago, we left home.
[time=747] It took us four days to get there.
[time=749] I thought we would never get to the temple, but then there it was.
[time=754] It was bigger than I ever imagined.
[time=756] It had these huge gates that opened up into the courtyard.
[time=760] Before we could go in though, we had to take our lamb to be inspected by one of the Levites.
[time=767] As we were making our way through the crowded streets, there was this man, this rabbi.
[time=771] He was teaching to the people that had gathered there outside of the gates.
[time=775] Jews, Greeks, foreigners, men and women alike.
[time=779] The boys wanted to stop and listen, but their Abba wouldn't let them.
[time=783] They wanted to make the sacrifice, so he pushed us through the gates toward the temple.
[time=789] He had us wait near the inspection line while he took a little Enoch to see the priest.
[time=794] That poor, poor little lamb.
[time=797] He bleated so loudly when Benjamin took him away from Ruthie.
[time=801] It nearly tore her heart, but he looked so good.
[time=806] We had bathed him as best we could before we left.
[time=808] In what little dirt he had on him, we just wiped right off.
[time=812] He was beautiful.
[time=816] I just knew that God would be pleased with our offering.
[time=822] But when Benjamin got to the head of the inspection line, the priest took our little lamb.
[time=828] He turned away so that Benjamin couldn't see what he was doing, but I saw it.
[time=832] I saw what he did.
[time=834] That horrible priest poked our little lamb right in the eye.
[time=839] He cried out so loudly, and his eye turned red and started to water.
[time=844] The priest then told Benjamin that our lamb wasn't unblemished.
[time=850] "Look at how his eye is runny," he said.
[time=853] "He is unfit to be a temple sacrifice.
[time=855] You will have to buy one of these instead." Ruthie cried out to him, but I quickly silenced her with my hand.
[time=866] She had to watch as Benjamin had to hand over our perfect lamb and all but a few of our coins.
[time=875] We would not have enough money now for provisions for the trip home.
[time=878] We would only be able to stay in the city one night.
[time=882] We would have to celebrate on the road, on the way home.
[time=888] But then something strange happened.
[time=893] That man, that rabbi, Jesus, he must have seen the whole thing.
[time=898] Our family's savings taken.
[time=901] Our precious, perfect lamb stolen.
[time=905] Our chance to celebrate the festival gone.
[time=909] And to make matters worse, the lamb that Benjamin had to buy was sickly.
[time=914] Oh, he smelled so felinated.
[time=916] His wool was all matted.
[time=918] I felt sick to my stomach to see my husband look so defeated.
[time=924] I watched Jesus.
[time=927] I saw the compassion in his eyes turned to hot anger.
[time=931] When that priest then took our blemished lamb and made another family by him because theirs
[time=937] was not suitable to the priest.
[time=939] I could not believe my eyes.
[time=942] Little Enoch, he tried to run out of the pen when the priest grabbed him.
[time=945] He tried to run to Ruthie.
[time=948] But instead, he was exchanged along with another pouch of money.
[time=953] It crushed our spirits to see it.
[time=958] But that's when it happened.
[time=960] That's when Jesus stormed through the gates, right up to the table.
[time=964] And with one move, he flipped that priest's table over spilling his money everywhere.
[time=968] Then he moved to another table and he flipped that one.
[time=970] And then another, and another until he had flipped all the tables.
[time=974] We were astonished at what we were seeing.
[time=976] Even Benjamin stopped to watch.
[time=980] With all eyes on Jesus, he said to the money changers, "My house will be called a house
[time=986] of prayer for all nations, but you, all of you, have turned it into a den of robbers."
[time=994] Well, that's all we heard because my husband made, and my oldest son take us out.
[time=1006] There was this huge crowd that was rushing to get out.
[time=1010] And just as big a crowd trying to get in, we lost my husband and my brother.
[time=1015] We were unable to find them until the next morning.
[time=1019] They made the sacrifice while we waited outside of the city gates.
[time=1024] That was two days ago.
[time=1030] We celebrated the Passover yesterday with what we could afford to buy in the city, which wasn't much.
[time=1039] But what an experience.
[time=1043] How angry that Jesus was over the injustice, our injustice.
[time=1049] He must have caused quite a commotion.
[time=1056] Word in the city is that many people think that he is the Messiah to think that we saw him.
[time=1063] That's only, maybe we'll never know, come on, be loved.
[time=1070] We still have a long way to go.
[time=1073] You know, if you're too tired, maybe you're able to let you ride one of the donkeys.
[time=1078] Why don't you go ask him?
[time=1087] Messiah, could it be true?
[time=1092] Could it be him?
[time=1096] Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation.
[time=1106] O my soul, praise him for he is thy health and salvation.
[time=1115] O ye who hear, now to his temple, drawn thee.
[time=1125] Join me in glad adoration.
[time=1136] Praise to the Lord, the Death Prosper thy work, and be friendly.
[time=1145] Surely his goodness and mercy, hear daily attend thee.
[time=1154] Wonder a new, what the Almighty can do, with his love he be friendly.
[time=1171] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=1193] And praise to the Lord who let all that is in me adore him.
[time=1202] All that have life and breath come down with praises before him.
[time=1210] Let thee amen, sound from his people again.
[time=1219] Let thee forever adore him.
[time=1227] Praise the Lord.
[time=1301] Then as Corbin and Doug were singing that chorus, just in this last week, God took a good friend
[time=1308] of ours, Dick Rowe, to be home.
[time=1312] With him he brought Steve Longbrake's mother home this last week after a long battle with
[time=1318] Alzheimer's.
[time=1319] I was thinking about some people who I'm aware of, who lost their jobs.
[time=1325] In the last few weeks I know of some who found some jobs.
[time=1331] I think of friends of mine who are doing their very best to parent in ways that would honor
[time=1339] God and be wise and discerning for their kids and I can think of a couple of instances
[time=1345] where that's going well and I know of some instances where it's not, I think of some people in my life who are experiencing the fullness and the bliss and the joy of answered prayers
[time=1358] and circumstantially things going far better than they ever imagined they could go and
[time=1364] I have friends today whose experience would be at the opposite end of that continuum and
[time=1372] in it all we can say praise the Lord.
[time=1379] The one who gives and the one who takes away, the one who is faithful and good and just
[time=1385] and right and true and what a privilege for all of us in the room to be able to sing those words and mean it and he is worthy of our praise, amen.
[time=1396] [AMEN] Well, I want to say a couple of things before we jump into our Roman study.
[time=1400] First of all, I want to just mention on the preparation scripture reading, I did want to make sure that you saw this when you get your card.
[time=1408] This is so, I'm so excited about this and I'm thankful again for the work Karen did.
[time=1413] She did a little extra work for us this year and that she has provided you not only with the passages to read each day but at the bottom of your card, each week as you go through
[time=1423] there, at the bottom of your card, there's a website that we've developed that you can go to for even more reading and more opportunity to interact with the great truth of what you've
[time=1436] been seeing as you've been following Jesus along on this journey.
[time=1441] And so at the bottom of each card, there's a website that our teams put together.
[time=1444] It will kind of change weekly and be very centered on that week's theme be it the temple
[time=1451] or the wilderness or guest semany.
[time=1453] It's just some great, great supplemental material for you to look at our teams put together some videos on those websites and you're just going to be really, really encouraged.
[time=1463] So when you get your cards, again, that website at the bottom gives you a chance to learn and study even more.
[time=1469] I also want to just thank Tom Beckner.
[time=1472] Tom is giving himself on a weekly basis to providing all of us with what we're calling
[time=1478] our Digging Deeper resource that's on our website from now on.
[time=1484] And I can't tell you how thankful I am and I can't tell you the great response we've gotten to this.
[time=1489] On our website, you can go and click on the Digging Deeper icon there and it gives you a chance to just continue on your own or with your small group or your friends, however
[time=1500] you're going to do it, gives you a chance to kind of further the discussion that we began on a Sunday morning, it's kind of a recap of the Sunday morning teaching and then a chance to just, it just invites you into some further study and some further learning and most importantly
[time=1515] some further application of that week's message and I'm so thankful for the work Tom has done.
[time=1522] And you can go to the website, click on there, download it, print it, whatever you want to do with it, it's there for you and I'm really, really glad that it's there.
[time=1529] Hey, turning your Bibles if you would this morning to Romans.
[time=1534] You can open up to Romans chapter 8.
[time=1536] Why disciples need doctrine?
[time=1539] This is the title that we have given our study.
[time=1543] It has been several weeks since we began it.
[time=1545] Why disciples need doctrine?
[time=1547] The reason for that title, many of you know that at Black Hawk these days, we have just attempted to do our very best with God's help to kind of re-raise the flag, if you will,
[time=1558] of discipleship.
[time=1560] It's what we're trying to not only be about, more importantly, it's who we're trying to be.
[time=1566] We've kind of just drawn a big line in the sand and put a big stake in the ground and said God with your help, we don't want to be church attenders anymore.
[time=1574] We don't want to sit in pews.
[time=1575] We don't want to be called church goers.
[time=1578] We're not even trying to be good people.
[time=1579] We want to be, by virtue of the definition itself, we want to be disciples.
[time=1586] We want to be a people who are deeply devoted to following after your son.
[time=1592] And that's what we're trying to do these days.
[time=1594] We're trying to live the life of a disciple.
[time=1596] In disciples, we've concluded need doctrine, doctrine, the deep truth about God.
[time=1603] And it's deep truth that we don't need to be intimidated by.
[time=1606] It's not deep truth that we need to be afraid of.
[time=1609] It's deep truth that connects our daily living to this picture that God has called us to.
[time=1615] He's called us to live and think and choose and value in certain ways.
[time=1620] And it is the deep truth about God that connects the everyday of our life to that picture that
[time=1626] God has called us to.
[time=1627] And so we have just been having a great time as we've been going through the book of Romans, not verse by verse, so to speak, but doctrine by doctrine.
[time=1636] It is a great book filled with deep truth about God.
[time=1641] And as we've been making our way through these first seven chapters, God has richly blessed our efforts.
[time=1647] It has been an incredibly encouraging time.
[time=1649] And I'm so thankful for the feedback that you all continue to give us.
[time=1654] I want to take you this morning to what will be kind of a brief review and an important
[time=1660] review and then an introduction to some amazing truth in chapter eight.
[time=1664] And I say a brief review for this reason, chapter six, seven, and eight in Romans is you know,
[time=1672] it's all important and there's so much there for all of us to understand and gain from.
[time=1677] But six, seven, and eight, my friends, is very, very strategic.
[time=1682] It's very, very important.
[time=1684] We see in six, seven, and eight, as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, the introduction of the doctrine of sanctification.
[time=1692] And it is so very important that we understand not only the doctrine itself, but it's so important to me that you understand where it fits into the flow of Romans as we've been making our way through.
[time=1703] So let me take you back at the beginning this morning to chapter six.
[time=1706] We, in chapter six, were introduced to this doctrine of sanctification and we defined
[time=1712] it as such.
[time=1713] Look with me if you would at the screen, sanctification.
[time=1716] The process by which a believer is, over time, conformed into the very image of Christ.
[time=1725] I want you to understand something about that top part there.
[time=1730] That's all God.
[time=1732] God sanctifies us.
[time=1734] God is the one who is overseeing.
[time=1737] God is the one who is in control of.
[time=1740] God is the one who is directing this process that He has us in.
[time=1746] Just like salvation was all Him.
[time=1753] Sanctification, my friends, ultimately is all Him.
[time=1756] It is a process.
[time=1758] It doesn't happen overnight.
[time=1759] It doesn't happen in a couple of weeks.
[time=1761] It takes more than usually a couple of years.
[time=1764] It is a lifelong journey of following after His Son, an intimate relationship with Him.
[time=1771] It is the process by which a believer is, over time, conformed, chipped away at molded,
[time=1779] shaped, rearranged.
[time=1782] There is this growing process that God takes us through and God is in control that as He conforms us into the very image of Christ.
[time=1790] Don't miss that.
[time=1791] I think sometimes it sounds so ridiculous to us in our humanness, to you and I.
[time=1797] Sometimes the thought is just so far reaching that we don't even want to say it.
[time=1801] But I want to say it to you this morning and remind you that it is at the heart of this great doctrine of sanctification that is that God has intended in this process to conform
[time=1813] shape, mold, rearrange, grow you so that in time you will be exactly like who, Jesus.
[time=1827] You're going to be like Christ.
[time=1833] And what He began in you, Philippians 1, 6, He's promised to complete.
[time=1838] And the process from that point of salvation and redemption to that completion where you and I are like Him.
[time=1844] This is called sanctification.
[time=1848] Now He does allow us to participate in this.
[time=1852] We'll talk a little bit more about that a little bit later this morning.
[time=1856] Our obedience to God's Word and our submission to the Holy Spirit, they play a role in this.
[time=1864] You say, "Well, wait a minute.
[time=1865] You said a little while ago it was all God.
[time=1866] It is all God." Yet in it being all God, God turns to you and I and asks for our participation in this
[time=1874] process that He directs and we'll look at that more closely in a little bit.
[time=1879] We learned that the doctrine of sanctification has mainly to do with the living out of the
[time=1885] previous doctrine that we studied in our look at the book of Romans, the doctrine of justification.
[time=1892] Second chapter 4 and 5, the doctrine of justification, the act of being, God declares us righteous.
[time=1900] He doesn't just declare us not guilty.
[time=1903] He declares us now from here on out, reclassified at the level of our soul, completely new, completely
[time=1911] fresh, just as if, justification, just as if we never sinned.
[time=1920] Sanctification, the living out of justification.
[time=1923] Now, when we came to the beginning of chapter 6 and this new sanctification conversation,
[time=1929] we saw that the principle of grace was so strongly inserted at the end of chapter 5 that
[time=1938] the apostle Paul almost sarcastically asked the question at the beginning of chapter 6, should we just keep sinning?
[time=1946] Since there's so much grace, should we just keep sinning so that grace may abound?
[time=1951] You saw it there?
[time=1952] Look with me at chapter 6 verse 1.
[time=1954] What shall we say then?
[time=1957] Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?
[time=1963] If grace is so overarching, if grace is so present, if grace is so dominant, what's the
[time=1969] big deal with sinning?
[time=1971] If there's so much grace, what's the problem with a little more sin?
[time=1976] The apostle Paul went on in chapter 6, we saw this two weeks ago, to basically say wrong question.
[time=1983] Bad idea.
[time=1984] He reminded us that if you've in fact come to faith in Christ, if you've in fact come
[time=1994] to faith in Christ, then you're positionally, remember that phrase we talked about it a
[time=2001] couple of weeks ago, we are positionally, Paul says, in Christ, if we've come to faith
[time=2007] in Christ, what that means is that positionally, even though literally and physically we understand
[time=2014] that we weren't there positionally, spiritually, we really were there.
[time=2019] When he died, you died.
[time=2022] You really did positionally in this picture of sanctification when he died, you died.
[time=2028] When he conquered sin's power and sin's penalty, you conquered it.
[time=2032] When he was resurrected to newness of life, you were resurrected to newness of life.
[time=2040] So chapter 6, ask the question, how then can we who died to sin still what?
[time=2046] Still live in it.
[time=2049] And I put the definition of living in sin up there for you just to be reminded of this morning, living in sin, to be dominated by it, to be enslaved to it.
[time=2061] This is living in sin.
[time=2063] How can one who has spiritually been redeemed, how has one who has been resurrected to the
[time=2069] newness of life, how can one who has experienced redemption, how can one who has died to sin
[time=2076] still be dominated by it, still be enslaved to it?
[time=2082] Paul says, you can't be.
[time=2084] That's just not how it goes.
[time=2090] It's not how it works.
[time=2091] In fact, halfway through chapter 6, if you were here, you'll remember he finally turns to those who were reading, he finally turns to you and me, and in essence says, okay,
[time=2101] chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and half of 6, all of that's God's part, clearly of God.
[time=2108] And then he turns to us in 6, 12, and it's as if, kind of, for the first time, he says, okay, now, now here's your part.
[time=2117] Here's where I give you the opportunity to participate with me, Romans 6, 12.
[time=2122] You can see it there in your Bible, therefore, do not let sin, do not let.
[time=2130] He doesn't say, I won't let, he's talking to you and says to you, do not let.
[time=2135] There's responsibility there.
[time=2137] There's participation.
[time=2138] There is the working out of our faith in fear and trembling.
[time=2142] Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts, and do not
[time=2150] go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness,
[time=2157] but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, because you are, positionally,
[time=2164] you are, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God, for sin shall not be
[time=2170] master over you, for you are not under law, but under grace.
[time=2175] It shall not dominate you, you shall not be enslaved to it.
[time=2180] He says, no, instead, access the same power that raised Jesus from the dead, the power
[time=2190] that now resides in anyone who has fully surrendered their heart and life to Christ.
[time=2198] The text says, if that's you that you are to present your body, we are to present our members no longer to sin.
[time=2206] Think about this, our eyes.
[time=2209] Think about your eyes and what you look at, your feet and where we walk, our fingers and
[time=2218] what we text or type, our appetites and what we eat or drink, our ears and what we listen
[time=2230] to, our mouths and lips and the very things we say, our minds and what we think.
[time=2238] Members of our bodies, our eyes, our feet, our fingers, our appetites, our ears, our mouths,
[time=2244] our lips, our minds, all of it were to present all of our members, Paul says, as instruments
[time=2251] of righteousness not sin, how's that going for you these days?
[time=2260] What are your members, your eyes, your ears, your lips, your fingers, your feet?
[time=2268] What are they producing?
[time=2271] What kind of work works of righteousness or works of sin?
[time=2277] It reminds me of 1 Corinthians 6 where Paul says that our bodies are the temple of the what, the Holy Spirit, to be engaged, our bodies, engaged in all of our bodies, all of
[time=2289] our members engaged in that kind of ministry.
[time=2295] Last week, chapter 7, Jesse reminded us that what Paul himself said, he reminds us, Jesse
[time=2302] did, that Paul himself said that this ongoing daily process of presenting the members of
[time=2309] our bodies as righteous instruments, Jesse reminded us that Paul said that would at times
[time=2315] not go well, that there were days and there were times when that whole thing just didn't
[time=2321] go at all like he had hoped, like he had wished, like he had desired.
[time=2328] Like at Romans 7, Romans 7, 15, Paul, the Apostle Paul himself with great authenticity and great
[time=2337] genuineness and with great honesty says in 7, 15, he says, "For I, for what I am doing,
[time=2344] I do not understand, for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the
[time=2350] very thing I hate." Verse 17, "So now no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells
[time=2358] in me." Verse 19, "For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil,
[time=2366] I do not want, which is very, very, very discouraging, isn't it? Isn't it? It's very unsettling,
[time=2390] it's very disheartening." I mean if you've ever felt that, if you've ever with Paul just
[time=2400] honestly before God just cried out, "Why? Why is it so hard? Why am I confessing this
[time=2407] to you again? Why do I keep doing what I don't want to do? Why the things I don't want to
[time=2414] do? I do the things I do, you know, that I should do, I don't do, there's this practice
[time=2420] of evil in me that I want to be a thousand miles away from, but it continues to show itself." I mean raise your hand if you felt that battle, a bunch of authentic, honest
[time=2430] people, thanks. It doesn't take long for the one who has fully surrendered his or her life
[time=2438] to following Christ to realize that they're in the middle of a war, not a skirmish, not a battle, but an all-out war, a war in which the enemy pulls no punches and stops at nothing
[time=2450] in his attempts to derail and defeat you, including, including maybe the most damaging
[time=2459] of all satanic attacks. I don't know what comes to your mind when I say satanic attacks.
[time=2464] If we together kind of pooled our thoughts and made a list of all the dark, seedy, horrible
[time=2470] things that Satan does when he attacks us and tries to derail us in our faith, I mean,
[time=2476] what would be on the list? It'd probably be a pretty interesting list, huh? I'll tell you one thing that maybe is the most damaging of all satanic attacks and that is tempting
[time=2488] you to doubt, tempting you to doubt the truth about all we just learned in one, two, three,
[time=2499] four, five, six, seven, tempting you to doubt. I mean, doing the things I hate, the things
[time=2509] I want to do, I don't do the things I don't want to do, I do. You live in that tension,
[time=2515] you live in that war, you live in that fight long enough and maybe, just maybe what the
[time=2521] enemy's trying to get you to say, what the enemy's trying to get you to think is maybe I will be condemned.
[time=2533] Maybe the wrath of God, Romans 1, 18, maybe the judgment of God will fall on me. Maybe
[time=2541] I'm just that bad. Maybe somewhere I missed it. Maybe I just didn't get it. Maybe all this isn't true because I keep struggling and I keep failing and maybe the wrath of God
[time=2554] that will be revealed against all sin and all ungodliness, maybe it's really going to fall on me, 724, oh wretched man that I am, who will save me from this body of death.
[time=2572] I've always said it, thank God for the end of chapter 7, beginning of chapter 8 is pretty amazing, but thank God for the end of chapter 7, 725, thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
[time=2589] our Lord, who will save me? Paul asked the question, you and I can ask the question,
[time=2595] who saves us? God will. God will through the good news of Jesus Christ, through the gospel.
[time=2603] So guess what Satan? Even though the process of sanctification is a struggle and even though
[time=2610] the all-out war with sin is at times dark, we can say with Paul and with great confidence
[time=2616] from the pages of the book of Romans, I have been justified, it's true, I have been, I
[time=2622] have been declared righteous, I have been reclassified, and I will be because God said
[time=2629] I would be sanctified, molded and shaped into the very image of Christ. So having said all
[time=2639] of that, Paul now moves to chapter 8, and what a great move it is, chapter 8 verse 1,
[time=2647] my friends read it with great joy and with great celebration. Therefore, in light of
[time=2653] all that, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Is there an
[time=2663] amen in the room? None. There is now, nor will there ever be any condemnation at all for
[time=2675] those who are in Christ Jesus. He wanted to be clear in chapter 6 that our part was to
[time=2687] engage in this war against sin and move the members of our bodies away from sin. He wanted
[time=2693] to be clear in 6. He wanted to be honest with you in 7 that the sanctification process or
[time=2701] the war, whatever you want to call it, would be brutal and at times confusing. And in chapter 8, he wants to clearly communicate that while the war may get ugly, three things to keep
[time=2712] in mind, actually four, victory, write it down. Victory has already been secured by whom?
[time=2719] Say it, Christ. Judgment has already been delivered. You understand this right? The condemnation,
[time=2726] the judgment, the wrath of God has already been exercised. Judgment has already been delivered
[time=2734] by God the Father unto who? You? No, but unto who? Christ as he hangs on the what? Cross.
[time=2745] Victory has already been secured. Judgment has already been delivered, and there is no condemnation for you or me if we are in Christ. And I want to just say to those of you in
[time=2761] the room, and if you've been around here at all, if you've been hanging out at Black Hawk, if you've been listening to this discussion and if you've gotten to know us at all, you know we say this. We say this to you with great love and with great heart. We don't
[time=2775] say it with a condemning or a judgmental tone. We just say to you, if you're not in Christ,
[time=2788] and if that's how that ends, if that's the choice that gets made, then the condemnation
[time=2794] and the judgment will come. And we wouldn't want that for you. We would want you to experience the newness of life. We would want you to experience the hope that comes when your heart and life and soul are redeemed. We would want you to experience the miracle of your life
[time=2810] being transformed. And we would invite you again today to honestly, genuinely in your
[time=2819] heart before Him, bow the knee of your heart and submit yourself to Him and His love and
[time=2826] His guidance and His direction. And we'd love to help you with that. If you need some help,
[time=2832] let us know. If you want to talk to somebody, come talk to us. If you have a trusted friend
[time=2838] here in this family, they'd love to talk with you about that. There is no condemnation.
[time=2846] For those who are in Christ Jesus. Now, there's one more thing. I know there's three bullets
[time=2852] there. You can just add a fourth because a very interesting doctrinal point is introduced
[time=2859] here in chapter eight. And that is the insertion of the Holy Spirit into not only the sanctification
[time=2867] discussion, but the book of Romans itself. What do I mean by that? Well, as you can see on the screen, the Holy Spirit, did you realize this? It's mentioned one time in the first seven chapters
[time=2878] of the book of Romans once. Here in chapter eight alone, the Holy Spirit is referenced 22 times.
[time=2885] They're just saving the Holy Spirit for chapter eight. And here in chapter eight, all of a sudden,
[time=2892] the Holy Spirit just takes front and center stage. God begins to unveil for you and for me
[time=2898] the integral part that He plays in this process of sanctification. I want you to see for yourselves
[time=2905] how significant this is. I want you to look at the role the Holy Spirit plays in you being
[time=2911] sanctified. And there's a number of reasons I want you to see this. Here's one of them.
[time=2915] Now, while you can look at the screen first, look at that. Eight, two, and three. We'll see the
[time=2921] Holy Spirit frees us. He's the freeing agent. He is the one who releases us from that captivity.
[time=2930] The Holy Spirit frees us from sin and death, eight, four. It's the Spirit of God that enables us to
[time=2936] fulfill God's law. Eight, five to thirteen, the Holy Spirit changes our nature and gives us strength
[time=2945] over our unredeemed flesh. You understand the word nature. It's your default mechanism.
[time=2953] It's your deepest bent. It's like who you really are down deep inside. And see, before Christ,
[time=2961] who you really were down deep inside, your nature, before you fully surrendered your heart and life
[time=2968] to Him, before you got redeemed and justified, the default mechanism was just sinfulness. You were
[time=2975] sinful. And sometimes you were ugly sinful Romans, one, and sometimes you were moral sinful Romans,
[time=2982] two, but it was all still sinful. And now the Spirit of God, we learn and we'll see in Romans
[time=2989] eight, changes our nature, that default mechanism, that who we are at the deepest part of our being
[time=2996] moves from being fleshly and sinful to spiritual and good and right and true. In 14 and 16,
[time=3006] the Holy Spirit solidifies our adoption as God's children. And then in 17 through 30,
[time=3013] it's the Spirit of God that guarantees our ultimate glory and victory.
[time=3020] Well, let me just show you this real quick. You could look at 8-1, therefore there is now no
[time=3026] condemnation. Well, you could say why or how. Well, why no condemnation? Well, look at verse two,
[time=3036] verses two and three, because the Holy Spirit has freed us from sin and death. Why no condemnation for the law of the Spirit of life. There it is. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[time=3051] has set you what? Say it out loud. Free. Has set you free from the law of sin and what? Death.
[time=3060] For what the law, Mosaic law, could not do weak as it was through the flesh. God did.
[time=3068] He corrects the problem, sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh. And as an offering
[time=3076] for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh. The Spirit frees us from sin and death. Two things I want you
[time=3085] to see there. Number one, we were spiritually speaking. We were in prison. We were in bondage.
[time=3091] We were in chains and the Spirit of God set us free. I want you to understand that.
[time=3100] There was no key that was going to open that lock. There was nothing you were going to be
[time=3106] able to do. There was no hope. It was futile. You were outside of relationship with Christ
[time=3113] in bondage to sin. And because of the gospel's good news, the Spirit of God is able to deliver
[time=3120] us. Walk us right out of that prison. I said there's two things I wanted you to see. One was that.
[time=3129] Secondly, this, a prison in which we were serving what kind of sentence? What kind of sentence were you serving? 20 to 30? Or life? Actually, death. Actually, you were on death row.
[time=3142] And that's the second thing I want you to see.
[time=3148] See where it says sin and death that the Spirit has set you free from sin and death?
[time=3153] Some of you may understand this. Many of you may know this. If you don't, please latch onto it.
[time=3158] The two are synonymous. Sin and death. There's no such thing as sin and life.
[time=3165] There's no such thing as sin and happiness. There is no such thing as sin and fulfillment.
[time=3171] There is no sin and good. There is no sin and joy. It's sin and what? Death.
[time=3179] Romans 3 in our study, Romans 3, we saw it for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of who.
[time=3188] And 623 said the wages of that sin, wages what you earn, what you get. The wages of that sin is what?
[time=3198] Death. Please allow your heart and mind to be reminded of this this morning,
[time=3206] or if you've never heard this before, please listen. Your sin will kill you.
[time=3210] It's the only thing sin leads to. Sin and death. Sin left unchecked will destroy and ruin you.
[time=3223] And when you come to faith in Christ, the Spirit of God at the beginning of this
[time=3230] sanctification process frees you from death. And here's a statement I would want everybody in the
[time=3239] room to just kind of just attach to that picture up there. It's like one of the reasons why I want
[time=3246] to take you through this. There's this statement that I want you just to kind of attach right over the top of all of that. And the statement is you're not alone. So many times in the midst
[time=3256] of this process, so many times in the midst of this war, so many times in your darkest hours
[time=3262] and minds sitting on the edge of her bed or alone in a car somewhere, we sometimes wonder if we're not alone. And the Word of God today speaks and breathes great
[time=3277] hope and promise and comfort into your understanding of this end mind. We in the sanctification process
[time=3284] are not alone. The Spirit of God frees us from sin and death. The Spirit of God enables us to
[time=3293] fulfill God's law, the Spirit of God. You see it again and again and again. The Spirit of God
[time=3301] enabling, the Spirit of God changing, the Spirit of God growing. You're not alone.
[time=3307] And I can't wait to show you more and we'll look at more when we come back together again.
[time=3313] And as we continue to study the great truth of this doctrine, as you and I begin this week to give
[time=3322] ourselves to the great truth of the preparation and the passages that we'll read, the items that
[time=3330] will fast, the resources that will give my prayer in all of this. My friends is that you and I will
[time=3339] continue to submit ourselves to this sanctification process. It's all God uses all of this to grow
[time=3346] you and change you and strengthen you. And what He began, He promises to complete. So what a joy to
[time=3353] get to experience that completion and that process with each and every one of you. Thank you for being
[time=3359] here. I'm going to have you stand and as you leave, make sure you pick up a packet of cards.
[time=3365] Be thinking about what it is you're going to fast. We'll begin today as we as we leave the
[time=3371] campus. We'll kind of be on and I can't wait to hear about what God does. I can't wait to see and
[time=3377] watch how God prepares us for that great day six weeks down the line. Stay focused. Do your very
[time=3383] best to focus your heart and your mind on the things that matter most in the days to come.
[time=3388] And we'll see what He does in us individually and as a family. Father God, we pray to you this
[time=3396] morning as we leave this place, knowing God that you don't leave us, knowing that you'll walk with us through these doors to lunch back to the house, back to maybe a comfortable afternoon or maybe a
[time=3410] hectic time with a lot of things to do and places to go. God, as we leave today and as we head into
[time=3417] this afternoon and this week, our prayer is that in a very supernatural way, you would give to us
[time=3423] great clarity and great focus, great purpose in our days and our nights. God, as we read your word,
[time=3432] as we follow your Son through the Scriptures, as He makes His way to the cross, God, I pray that
[time=3438] you would grab hold of our lives in a unique and powerful way. I pray that our fasting, I pray that
[time=3445] the hunger, so to speak, that we experience God would remind us of the fact that only in you are
[time=3454] we satisfied and God I pray that our giving would be a representation of our gratitude and our desire
[time=3461] to come alongside and help and encourage those in need. Father God, we thank you for the morning, thank you for the privilege that's been ours to worship you, to declare what is true and right
[time=3472] and to open up your word. May all of this, God, make a difference in the way we live. May it be so,
[time=3478] God, and may it be so because it's what you do, and we'll thank you for it.
