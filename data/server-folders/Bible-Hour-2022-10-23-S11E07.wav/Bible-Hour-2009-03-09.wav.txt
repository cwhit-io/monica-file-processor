[time=30] [MUSIC - 37 seconds]
[time=72] (audience applauds)
[time=87] You know, the hymn tune that we're all familiar with has a phrase in it that says this, God is the center of unbroken praise.
[time=95] I love to think about that.
[time=96] You know, week in and week out, we get together and we praise Him in song.
[time=100] My hope and my prayers that every day you wake up with praise on your lips for Him.
[time=104] And don't forget that our God is a center of never ending, forever lasting, praise and worshiping glory.
[time=111] And I wanna use this next song for us to do that together, to worship the center of unbroken praise.
[time=118] [MUSIC - 160 seconds]
[time=285] (soft guitar music) Let's sing that one more time.
[time=292] Lift your voices today if you've come to worship.
[time=294] [MUSIC - 40 seconds]
[time=343] - Hi everybody, welcome to the broadcast today.
[time=345] It's great to have you with us.
[time=346] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving as the senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=352] And I also have the privilege week after week, month after month.
[time=356] Literally for years now, I've been bumping into many of you out in this community of ours here in the Greater Fort Wayne area.
[time=364] You know, when we meet in the grocery store or at the gas station or at a ballgame somewhere, I'm so encouraged by your willingness to come and talk with me.
[time=374] And oftentimes those conversations end up with you sharing how thankful you are for the spirit and the heart of our ministry.
[time=384] And those are words that many people in the community often use, the spirit and the heart of Black Hawk.
[time=390] And while you may be referring to the message periodically, I think more than the message, more than me, I think you're referring to the spirit and heart of this place and these people.
[time=402] And I agree with that wholeheartedly.
[time=404] I think God has had his hand on this place for years and years and years.
[time=408] And I think he's got his hand on these people.
[time=411] And of all the ministries that we have the privilege of being a part of here, I think our school, Black Hawk Christian School probably expresses the spirit and heart of this place just as well as any of them.
[time=426] I'm so thankful for our school.
[time=427] I'm so thankful for the spirit and heart of our team.
[time=431] And I'm so thankful for the mission that we're attempting to accomplish with our school.
[time=436] We're trying to reach kids and families all over this region and give them while we reach them a biblical education and an opportunity to be prepared as young people, to face an ever-changing world in a way that will truly make a difference.
[time=453] I'm so thankful for Bill Hartman, our lead administrator.
[time=455] So thankful for his staff and our faculty, our teachers, from preschool all the way up through seniors in high school.
[time=463] We are making an enormous investment of time and energy and heart and truth into the lives of young people.
[time=470] And we come to a time now in the early spring where enrollment opportunities are available to each and every one of you.
[time=478] There are spaces available.
[time=480] We've got seats that are open and we'd love for you to come.
[time=483] And to our campus, we'd love for you as parents to come and ask questions of our team.
[time=488] We'd love for your kids to come and shadow a student during a normal school day.
[time=493] All of this can be arranged by calling our school.
[time=496] The number is here on your screen.
[time=497] The website is there at the bottom of the screen as well.
[time=500] And I hope you'll give some thought to your children's future, the kind of investment that we make, we believe, will make a difference in the way they could face their future and face it well.
[time=512] Thank you so much for tuning in today.
[time=514] We're so thankful that you're a part of our family.
[time=517] I hope you'll open your heart and mind to what God's word has for you today.
[time=521] It's good to have you with us.
[time=522] And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=595] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 155 seconds]
[time=757] - I'm so grateful for the opportunity
[time=765] to invite you back in to what we've been calling the deep truth of God's word, our study of doctrine and why disciples need it, why disciples need to take that which is really true about God and apply it to the everyday of their life.
[time=781] It's exactly what God has called us to and it's exactly what we've been trying to kind of dive into over these last several weeks and this morning in our look at doctrine from the book of Romans, we come to a section and we are gonna try something this morning that I admit up front, a bit on the aggressive side but we're gonna give it a shot.
[time=801] We come to a section really of three chapters, chapters nine, 10 and 11 and we are going to, I'm gonna take a deep breath here in about two minutes and we're gonna jump into what is an extremely interesting, very challenging, oftentimes debated section of scripture in an attempt to not get lost in the debate but instead to somehow try our very best to make it as real and honest and practical as possible so that you can walk away today with an understanding of it, maybe hopefully a better understanding of it but again, as we've been trying to do through this whole series, not just an understanding of it but a way to apply its truth in the everyday of your life and so this morning we come to Romans nine, 10 and 11 and let me just start by reading this to you in Romans chapters nine to 11, Paul attempts to deal with one of the most challenging doctrinal issues that we as believers get to wrestle with, the issue of the Jews, the spiritual nation of Israel and their place in God's unfolding redemptive plan.
[time=874] Now, many of you in the room may be very familiar with this, many of you in the room may have read at length regarding this issue.
[time=882] I'm sure most of us in the room just kind of growing up as we've grown up, we've heard news reports and we've heard things in school and we've heard discussions out and about that connect the people of Israel to the person of God.
[time=897] Most of us, if I quizzed you here this morning would know that there's some kind of connection.
[time=903] Most of us in the room would think that that connection is somehow to be an ongoing one and yet oftentimes we lack kind of the biblical understanding of how that thing started, where it is today and most importantly where it will end.
[time=918] And so again, let me just say this up front, there may be a few of you in the room who I've already lost.
[time=924] You may be thinking, gee, I needed something for the everyday of life today and he's gonna talk about Israel in the Middle East.
[time=932] And I just, I really wanna encourage you.
[time=935] I believe there are some truths here for you and me today that we desperately need to understand about Israel.
[time=941] But in the looking at that truth, I guarantee you, there will be some things for you to chew on and wrestle with and take home with you and apply in the everyday of your life.
[time=952] Just hang on and you'll see for yourself.
[time=955] You see on the one hand, they were God's chosen people.
[time=959] They had had a unique place in God's heart and in his eternal purposes.
[time=966] And yet, on the other hand, when God's son had come into the world, they, the Jews, had rejected his messiahship and crucified him without cause.
[time=976] This special people of God who God had put aside, who God had identified as his chosen people.
[time=983] When the messiah comes to redeem them, when the very messiah who they were to look for came, they missed him.
[time=989] They reject him and they crucify him without cause.
[time=992] How is this tragic paradox to be explained?
[time=996] That is the problem which Paul seeks to address in these three chapters.
[time=999] Are they still his people?
[time=1001] Will Israel be redeemed?
[time=1002] Has God abandoned his promise to them?
[time=1005] When or how will his promise to Israel be fulfilled?
[time=1010] And let me do this if I can.
[time=1012] Let me just take a few minutes here at the beginning.
[time=1014] I want to invite you to open up your Bibles to Romans chapter nine.
[time=1017] And we're gonna take a few minutes and I'm gonna just highlight a few passages in this three chapter section.
[time=1023] I'm gonna just read through with you some passages that I believe will set a context for our discussion this morning.
[time=1032] It's an aggressive attempt I admit upfront.
[time=1035] First hour, we almost made it.
[time=1037] I'm gonna try my best to get us through it here, second hour, but it's so very important that we at least give this a look.
[time=1045] I think there's some things for us here.
[time=1046] And I want to just read, if I can, several passages that I think get us moving in the right direction.
[time=1052] Let's begin at nine one.
[time=1054] Romans nine, and we're gonna look at nine one to five.
[time=1057] Paul here says, "I am telling the truth in Christ.
[time=1061] I'm not lying.
[time=1063] My conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.
[time=1071] What is the grief in Paul's heart?
[time=1073] For I would wish that I myself were accursed." This is a very personal passage.
[time=1079] This is a very personal, intimate beginning to what he's about to unfold.
[time=1084] Paul wants the reader to understand that he feels deeply about this.
[time=1089] And there's a reason he feels deeply about this.
[time=1092] And you're about to see it.
[time=1094] "For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from God, damned," he says.
[time=1102] "Separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh, who are verse four Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the temple service, and the promises who are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ, according to the flesh, who is overall God blessed forever, amen." Paul here, right out of the gate expressing his deep concern for the spiritual health of the nation of Israel, the Israelites, the Jews, identifying the fact that they are, at this point, separated from God.
[time=1150] He doesn't want them to be separated from God.
[time=1153] He wants them to be back with God.
[time=1155] And he says, "I'd even give my own life if they could come to know the Christ." Skip over to Romans 9.30, 9.30 and 32.
[time=1166] Just again, trying to set a little bit of the backdrop for you, what shall we say then?
[time=1172] That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness.
[time=1179] Even the righteousness, which is by faith, we've been studying that for the last eight chapters.
[time=1184] But Israel, verse 31, pursuing a law of righteousness did not arrive at that law.
[time=1190] Why?
[time=1191] What went wrong for Israel?
[time=1194] Because they did not pursue it the righteousness.
[time=1197] They did not pursue it by what?
[time=1199] But as though it were by what?
[time=1203] Works.
[time=1204] They stumbled over the stumbling stone.
[time=1208] Skip down there to chapter 10.
[time=1210] Chapter 10, verses one to three.
[time=1213] "Brother, in my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their what?
[time=1218] For their salvation.
[time=1220] For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.
[time=1227] For not knowing about God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
[time=1236] They did not subject themselves to the one who brought the righteousness of God.
[time=1241] They did not subject themselves to the one through whom the righteousness of God is imputed." Remember our study, they did not subject themselves to Messiah, they rejected Messiah, and in the rejecting of Messiah, they missed God.
[time=1257] They missed the righteousness of God and the one who delivered it.
[time=1261] For Christ, verse four of Romans 10, for Christ is the end of the law, for righteousness to every one who believes.
[time=1271] Go over to chapter 11, if you would.
[time=1275] Romans 11, one to six, I say then, God has not rejected his people.
[time=1280] Has he?
[time=1281] May it never be, Paul says.
[time=1285] For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin.
[time=1292] God has not rejected his people, whom he foreknew, or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah?
[time=1302] Here he quotes from First Kings.
[time=1307] Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah?
[time=1311] How he Elijah pleads with God against Israel.
[time=1315] Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.
[time=1323] But what is the divine response to him?
[time=1325] God says to Elijah, "I have kept for myself 7,000 men
[time=1331] "who have not bowed the knee to bail." In the same way then, there has also come to be, at the present time, now Paul writing.
[time=1340] In the same way then, there has also come to be, at the present time, a remnant, according to God's gracious choice.
[time=1350] But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of what works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.
[time=1359] It says down there in verse 11, Romans 11 and 11.
[time=1363] I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they, may it never be.
[time=1369] But by their transgression, by the transgression of the Jews, he refers there to the nation of Israel.
[time=1376] But by their transgression, salvation has come to who?
[time=1380] The Gentiles.
[time=1382] Hey, and just for anybody in the room, we're always grateful to have anybody in the room who, maybe this is all kind of new too.
[time=1390] And so I just want you to know, whenever you hear us say Gentiles, in God's design here, the way this thing plays out, there were the Jews, and then there were those who weren't Jews.
[time=1401] So anybody who's not a Jew is referred to as a Gentile.
[time=1405] So welcome Gentiles.
[time=1407] Gentiles, oh, that's a great verse there.
[time=1410] Sorry, and I interrupted that.
[time=1412] Great verse 11, 11 may it never be, but by their transgression, the Jews, salvation has come to you and me, to the Gentiles, to make them the Jews jealous.
[time=1423] Interesting, we'll come back to that.
[time=1425] Go down to 1125, 1125, for I do not want you,
[time=1431] for I do not want you brethren to be uninformed of this mystery so that you will not be wise in your own estimation that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in until all those Gentiles who will someday be saved or saved until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
[time=1459] And so all Israel will be saved just as it is written.
[time=1463] The deliverer will come from Zion.
[time=1465] He will remove ungodliness from Jacob.
[time=1468] This is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.
[time=1473] And it says in 28, from the standpoint of the gospel, they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God's choice, they are beloved for the sake of the fathers.
[time=1488] Pray with me, oh Father God, in heaven, would you just in these next remaining moments in ways that only you can, God, would you bring great clarity and great understanding to this room as we consider these truths?
[time=1504] God, we want to understand these things as best we can.
[time=1509] And at the same time, God, we want to not only understand them, but we want to then apply these truths in whatever ways we can.
[time=1516] And oh God, would you give us the strength and the ability?
[time=1520] It is so far beyond us, God, to do that.
[time=1522] Please guard my mouth from error.
[time=1525] And God, may you be glorified in these moments in your son's name, we pray, amen.
[time=1531] So let me just invite you to some truth to take home, some things to think about from Romans 9, 10, and 11.
[time=1537] We're going to just kind of start making our way through some points.
[time=1539] I hope you'll write these down.
[time=1541] I hope you'll stay mentally engaged and I'll do my very best to keep you there.
[time=1547] First thing I want you to know is that in this treatment in Romans 9, 10, and 11 of this issue, Paul never denies, ever, nor should he, that the Jews were the chosen people of God.
[time=1559] Write that down, the Jews were, they really truly, sincerely were the chosen people of God, that choosing of them, that setting them apart.
[time=1568] Go back in your Bibles to the very beginning.
[time=1570] Go back to Genesis chapter 12, would you?
[time=1573] In Genesis 12 you see where this begins, this begins between God and a man named Abram.
[time=1579] He later became known as Abraham, here he is Abram, and it is in 12 verses one to three that God sets out this special, very unique relationship that he was wanting to establish and maintain with the people of Israel.
[time=1593] Now the Lord said to Abram, go forth from your country and from your relatives and from your father's house, to the land, to the land which I will show you, the promised land, the land that God had set aside for that nation, and I will make you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great.
[time=1615] And so you shall be a blessing and I will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you, I will curse, and in you Abram, all the families of the earth.
[time=1626] It's a very significant line.
[time=1630] We'll come back and make a connection there later, but in you, all the families of the nation of Israel, is that what it says?
[time=1640] Now in you, all the families of the what?
[time=1643] Of the earth will be blessed.
[time=1647] God adopted the nation of Israel as his own.
[time=1651] He gave them the covenants as the passage said that we read.
[time=1654] He gave them the covenants and the service of the temple and the law.
[time=1657] He gave them the presence of his Shekinah glory.
[time=1660] He gave them the patriarchs above all.
[time=1662] Jesus was a Jew and he gave them Jesus.
[time=1665] The special place of the Jews and God's economy of salvation Paul accepts as the starting point of this whole doctrinal challenge.
[time=1677] Katie, I want you to skip that next point.
[time=1679] Just go on to the third.
[time=1681] In chapter nine, Paul then looks back on the history of the Jewish nation and he makes a very important point here.
[time=1689] I want you to write this down.
[time=1690] He looks back on the history of the Jewish nation and their relationship and interaction with God and he gives another point.
[time=1696] That point is that racial dissent alone.
[time=1701] Racial dissent alone does not make a Jew.
[time=1707] Write that down.
[time=1708] Racial dissent alone does not make a Jew over and over again.
[time=1713] In Jewish history, there was in God's ways a process of selection.
[time=1718] Now we're about to get into something here that's really, really confusing and really, really amazing and really, really important so just bear with me.
[time=1728] Over and over again in Jewish history, there was in God's ways with the Jews, a process of selection, Paul calls it election, whereby some of those who were racial descendants of Abraham were chosen and some were what?
[time=1746] Some were not, some were not.
[time=1750] In the case of Abraham, Isaac, the sun born according to the promise of God was chosen.
[time=1757] Go to the promise of God.
[time=1759] Go back to Romans nine, go to nine six.
[time=1764] But it is not as though the word of God has failed.
[time=1768] Romans nine six.
[time=1769] It is not as though the word of God has failed for they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel.
[time=1776] You with me there, nor are they all children
[time=1782] because they are Abraham's descendants.
[time=1784] You understand the story there of Abraham and Isaac,
[time=1790] the sun born according to the promise of God.
[time=1793] He was chosen but Abraham had another son named what?
[time=1797] Ishmael and Ishmael wasn't born according to the promise, Ishmael was born according to the compromise and he was not chosen.
[time=1807] It just wasn't, it wasn't God's plan.
[time=1811] In the case of Isaac, Abraham's son.
[time=1816] In the case of Isaac, his son Jacob was chosen but Esau, Jacob's twin was not.
[time=1822] This selection of Jacob over Esau had absolutely nothing to do with merit.
[time=1830] It had absolutely nothing to do with how those boys chose to live.
[time=1833] It was the work entirely of God's electing wisdom and power.
[time=1838] Go back to nine, verse 10.
[time=1841] Romans nine, 10 and 11 and not only this but there was Rebecca also when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad so that God's purpose according to his choice would stand not because of works but because of him but because of him who calls.
[time=1870] More to say on that in a moment
[time=1877] but just start chewing on that.
[time=1880] It's an important, very, very important truth.
[time=1883] Let's keep moving forward.
[time=1887] Another point worthy of I think you just taking your pin and writing this down.
[time=1892] The real, we often hear this phrase or this tagline that chosen people, the real chosen people.
[time=1899] As you read through the Old Testament, as you become more and more familiar with the story of God and his people, the real chosen people was never the whole nation.
[time=1911] If I were to ask most of you in the room, if it was, you, many of us would say, yeah, we kind of always thought it was the whole nation.
[time=1920] It wasn't.
[time=1921] My friends, it was always a very righteous few.
[time=1924] It was always a righteous remnant.
[time=1926] There's a word for you.
[time=1928] Not the whole but a part of that which is left over, a remnant, the chosen people was always a righteous remnant, the few who were true to God when all others denied him.
[time=1942] It was so in the days of Elijah, we read about that.
[time=1946] When 7,000 remained faithful to God after the rest of the nation had gone after Baal.
[time=1952] It was an essential part of the teaching of Isaiah.
[time=1955] You can write this down, Isaiah 10, 21 and 22.
[time=1958] It's on the screen for you right now.
[time=1960] This remnant idea, very much a part of Isaiah's teaching.
[time=1963] Isaiah 10, 21 says a remnant will return, speaking of future events now.
[time=1969] A remnant will return.
[time=1970] A remnant of Jacob will return to the mighty God.
[time=1974] And then look what it says in 22.
[time=1976] For though your people, O Israel, may be like the sand of the sea, the whole nation.
[time=1982] Only a remnant, only a portion within them will return.
[time=1992] A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.
[time=1997] Paul's point is that at no time were the whole people of Israel classified, at least in God's mind and heart, as the chosen people.
[time=2009] There was always selection.
[time=2012] There has always been election on the part of God.
[time=2018] As time went by, now as we look at the story of the nation of Israel and their spiritual relationship with their God, as time goes by and the process of God's redemptive plan for the nations, it became clear that Israel was unfaithful.
[time=2037] It began to be clear that God was moving away from Israel as being that redemptive tool that he hoped they would be.
[time=2045] And in time, as it relates to the function that God had set them apart to, they were rejected.
[time=2051] Now, before we move on, I wanna ask you, let's get personal and let's get honest and let's bring this down to the everyday of life.
[time=2058] And I know this is a question that you've thought about.
[time=2060] I know it's something I've dealt with for years.
[time=2062] Let's just at least put it on the table this morning.
[time=2065] And let's just do our best to interact with it.
[time=2068] Is it fair?
[time=2070] And then I'll use that word.
[time=2072] Is it's a word that I think we often identify with?
[time=2075] Is it fair of God to elect some and reject not elect others?
[time=2087] And if some men are elected and others are rejected
[time=2093] through no virtue or fault of their own, how can you blame them?
[time=2097] How can you be against them if they reject Christ?
[time=2100] And how can you likewise praise them if they accept him?
[time=2103] Here Paul uses an argument at which, and I quote here from an author I read this week and I just, I couldn't have said it better so I just quoted it.
[time=2116] Here Paul uses an argument at which the mind staggers and from which we quite properly at times want to recoil.
[time=2127] Did you catch that?
[time=2130] Here Paul begins to describe for you and I a truth.
[time=2134] Here Paul begins to lay out for us an argument at which the mind staggers and from which we quite properly at times begin to recoil.
[time=2145] Bluntly it is that God can do as he chooses and that man, being man, has no right to question his decisions, however confusing they may be.
[time=2161] I believe that's true.
[time=2163] I believe that God can do what he chooses with whom he chooses and I believe that is completely and absolutely his prerogative.
[time=2174] You know what goes on my friends in this discussion with you and me?
[time=2177] I will speak for you on this one 'cause I've had this conversation with so many of you for so many years.
[time=2183] So many times we start thinking about this selection, this idea of God doing what God wants to do, not based on anything you've done or said, not based on the merit of anyone, you know, the twins in the womb, one he loved, one he hated, it says there in Romans nine.
[time=2205] We start thinking about that and here's what we do.
[time=2208] We immediately go in our attempt to try and understand it.
[time=2212] We immediately go to a place, a posture, grounded in our perspective.
[time=2218] We look at this thing from our vantage point and from our human vantage point as we look at all those kinds of statements and those kinds of truths, it can begin to be very confusing, even maddening.
[time=2234] It can seem on what, unfair.
[time=2236] I love what Paul does though, in our passage here, he begins to help us switch vantage points, which I think is very difficult, but very important to do this.
[time=2249] Look at nine, 20 and 21, watch how he helps us shift our perspective on how we're viewing this whole idea of selection or election.
[time=2259] On the contrary, Paul says, who are you, oh man, who answers back to God?
[time=2263] Almost sounds like the Job deal, right?
[time=2265] All over again.
[time=2266] The thing molded will not say to the molder,
[time=2272] why did you make me like this?
[time=2274] Will it?
[time=2275] Go ahead and answer that out loud.
[time=2278] No, that doesn't happen.
[time=2282] Wait, it can't happen.
[time=2284] All right.
[time=2286] Or does the potter have a right over the clay
[time=2292] to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?
[time=2304] Does he have that right?
[time=2306] Yes or no?
[time=2306] Yeah, he does.
[time=2309] He has the right as the potter to take the lump of clay and make whatever he wants.
[time=2316] Some of what he makes will be honorable, some of what he makes won't.
[time=2320] The clay cannot talk back to the potter, a craftsman may take two vessels, one for an honorable purpose, another for a menial task.
[time=2329] The vessels have nothing whatever to do with it.
[time=2332] That said, Paul is what God has the right to do with men.
[time=2337] All right, keep thinking.
[time=2340] Stay with me here.
[time=2341] Let's go back to the rejection of Israel for a moment.
[time=2345] Back to the rejection of Israel, God's choice.
[time=2350] To select in this case in a different direction from them.
[time=2356] It's important that you write this down or at least know this.
[time=2358] It was not a callous or thoughtless act on God's part.
[time=2361] The door was shut to the Jew.
[time=2364] There came a point in time when the door was shut to the Jews that it might be opened to the who, Gentiles.
[time=2371] God hardened the hearts, you can write it down.
[time=2375] One more point to consider here.
[time=2377] God hardened the hearts of the Jews and blinded their eyes with the ultimate purpose of opening a way for you and I, for the Gentiles to come into the faith.
[time=2391] And you know what the truth of the matter is that the people of Israel had been forewarned of the election of the Gentiles and of their own rejection by the prophets for years and years, for hundreds of years, the prophets had been warning.
[time=2407] The prophets had been speaking to this very reality.
[time=2410] Hosea, write this down.
[time=2412] Hosea chapter one, verse 10.
[time=2415] Hosea chapter one, verse 10, you can see it there on your screen.
[time=2418] Yet the number, you see it?
[time=2420] Yet the number of the sons of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered.
[time=2426] And in the place where it is said to them, you are not my people, it will be said to them, you are the sons of the living God.
[time=2437] They were told this would happen.
[time=2438] In one translation it says, those who were not my people, I will call my people and her who was Gentiles and her who was not beloved, I will call my beloved.
[time=2452] Here is yet another challenging truth.
[time=2459] Stripped of all its essentials, God can do what he likes with any man or nation and that he deliberately darkened the minds and shut the eyes of the Jews in order that the Gentiles might redeemed is exactly what he did.
[time=2477] It's exactly what he did.
[time=2480] Now as I'm reading, okay, this week, I'm reading through this book and I'm reading through this book and I'm listening to this message over here.
[time=2487] I'm just kind of taking all this stuff and it was interesting that as I got to this point, in one of the books I was reading, the author asked the question and he did it with a purpose.
[time=2500] One author at this point asks the question, so really what was the fundamental mistake of the Jews?
[time=2506] I mean, look what happened to them.
[time=2509] I mean, look who they were supposed to be, look what they were supposed to be given, look at the blessings that were supposed to have been theirs.
[time=2515] Then something happens, they make some choices, they go in a certain direction and then boom, all of a sudden this thing gets changed.
[time=2523] And so this one author, almost sarcastically, the more I read, asks the question, so what was the fundamental mistake of the Jews?
[time=2534] And let me just quote William Barkley here, I think it'll be on the screen.
[time=2538] This may seem a curious question to ask in view of what we have just said.
[time=2546] Okay, stop right there.
[time=2547] Are any of you tracking with that?
[time=2550] Do you understand why it may be a curious question to ask?
[time=2555] So what did the Jews do to warrant this response from God?
[time=2560] What was their mistake that they made?
[time=2564] See, the curious question is that in Romans 9, God selects and rejects based in no part on the merit or choices or actions of men.
[time=2576] You believe that?
[time=2579] Say yes, I do.
[time=2582] But then in 10, one to four, Paul says that the Jews messed up.
[time=2587] In 10, one to four, Paul says that the Jews, they got all into their works and they got all into the law and they got all into trying to attain righteousness through their own merit and they get dumped.
[time=2598] So which is it?
[time=2600] Was it the choices they made and the consequences of those choices that led God to choose what he did with them and removing them or had God chosen that from before the foundations of the earth that he selected, rejected, elected, however you want to say it, it's just an interesting paradox.
[time=2618] And Barkley goes on, but paradoxically, Paul holds that though the rejection of the Jews was the work of God, it need never have happened.
[time=2628] He cannot get rid of the eternal paradox in his writing here nor does he desire to, that at one and the same time, all is of God and man has what, free will.
[time=2640] The fundamental mistake, let's answer the question, the fundamental mistake according to the scripture of the Jews was that they tried to get into a right relationship with God through their own efforts.
[time=2652] They tried to earn salvation, whereas the Gentiles simply accepted the offer of God in perfect trust.
[time=2659] And you know what the sad thing is my friends, the Jews should have known better.
[time=2665] The Jews should have been clearer on this.
[time=2667] They should have known from what the prophets, their prophets had told them and taught them from the day they were born, that the only way to God was the way of faith and that human achievement led nowhere.
[time=2679] Isaiah said it himself, you can write this down, Isaiah 28, 16.
[time=2683] Isaiah said no one who believes in him will be put to shame.
[time=2687] Isaiah said no one who, he didn't say no one who accomplishes every aspect of the law will not be put to shame.
[time=2696] What he said was anybody who believes, no one who believes in him will be put to shame.
[time=2702] Joel, the prophet Joel said everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.
[time=2710] Joel didn't reference the law.
[time=2712] Joel didn't reference their choices in terms of keeping those rules.
[time=2715] Joel said if you call upon the name of the Lord, you will be saved Joel 2.32.
[time=2723] Interesting, Paul quotes Isaiah and Joel in Romans 10 where he talks about in a verse that you and I are very familiar with.
[time=2731] We teach it to our kids all the time, Romans 10, nine and 10 where it talks about believing in your heart and confessing with your what, that Jesus is what Lord and you will be what saved.
[time=2744] No man, it's true, no man can have faith until he hears the offer of God.
[time=2750] But to the Jews, it's the point we're making here, that offer was made and they clung to the way of human achievement through obedience to the law.
[time=2759] They staked everything on works, everything.
[time=2763] And they should have known that the way to God was the way of faith, but they didn't.
[time=2769] And that whole thing went in a different direction.
[time=2773] Once again, it is to be stressed.
[time=2776] Once again, you should underline it, that all of this was God's arrangement and that it was arranged in this way to allow the Gentiles to come in.
[time=2786] Now, that's a pretty heady thing if you're a Gentile.
[time=2791] If you're a Gentile in this day, if you're a Gentile there in Rome, Paul's concerned because Paul wants you to know that that's how it went down.
[time=2798] The Jews were blinded, the Jews were set aside so that the Gentiles could come in and in essence be the new people.
[time=2805] I mean, there was the old people, now there was new people.
[time=2808] And now the Gentiles had the privilege of knowing God and living in faith relationship with him through the sun.
[time=2814] And Paul doesn't want them to be prideful of this.
[time=2816] Paul doesn't want them to be arrogant.
[time=2819] Paul doesn't want them to begin to set themselves up as the people of God like who did.
[time=2826] Who got arrogant and who got prideful
[time=2832] and who ended up on the outside looking in?
[time=2836] This whole thing just got flip-flopped.
[time=2839] So Paul says, look, in fact, go to Romans 11.
[time=2842] Paul turns to the Gentiles and exhorts them to have no pride.
[time=2848] Now this is heady stuff.
[time=2850] Stay with me here, we can do this.
[time=2852] We are not intimidated by this.
[time=2855] We love the deep truth about God and I'll tell you what, this is an amazing few verses.
[time=2860] 11, 17 to 24, all under the context of Paul trying to get the Gentiles not to get cocky with this, not to get arrogant.
[time=2870] He says, remember, but if some of the branches, if some of the branches were broken off and you, Gentile, being a wild olive, were grafted in.
[time=2884] I don't know if any of you have ever been a part of an agricultural experiment where limbs or branches are actually grafted in, but that's the picture.
[time=2894] And you, Gentile, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, the Jews, and became partakers with them of the rich root
[time=2905] of the olive tree.
[time=2906] What a great picture.
[time=2907] Do not be arrogant toward the branches, but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you.
[time=2918] So Gentiles, be careful because we understand that the Jewish branch kind of got grafted out, you got grafted in, but the whole root is at its base Jewish.
[time=2929] It's of God that supports you.
[time=2934] Verse 19, you will say then, branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in, quite right.
[time=2942] They were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith, do not be conceited, but fear for if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.
[time=2956] Behold then, I love this, in that picture, behold then the kindness and severity of God, both to those who fell severity, but to you, Gentile, God's kindness, if you continue in his kindness, otherwise you also will be cut off.
[time=2977] And they also, Jews, if they do not continue in their unbelief, here it goes, watch this, will be grafted back in, for God is able to graft them in again, for if you were cut off from what is by nature, a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?
[time=3013] Wow.
[time=3014] The Gentiles are in the position of wild olive shoots
[time=3020] which have been grafted into a garden olive tree.
[time=3024] They did not achieve their own salvation anymore than the Jews did.
[time=3028] And in truth, they are dependent on the Jews.
[time=3032] They are only grafted branches.
[time=3034] The root and the stem are still the chosen people.
[time=3038] The fact of their own election and the fact of their,
[time=3046] and the fact of the rejection of the Jews are not to produce pride in Gentile hearts.
[time=3051] And Paul warns them if that happens, rejection can and will happen to them.
[time=3056] All right, well, we gotta go, but listen, one more huge thought here, very important, is this the end, Israel out, Gentiles in, no, far from it.
[time=3066] It is, I believe, and I say that to you this morning,
[time=3072] I believe we would say to you this morning as a result of our study and our best understanding of this, and I say that with great humility, and I say that with a soft heart, and I'm still learning as I go, but I would say to you this morning that I believe it is God's purpose, that the Jews will be moved according to the passages we've read here, that the Jews will be moved to envy, at the relationship that the Gentiles have with God.
[time=3103] You can read it there on the screen.
[time=3105] In time, the Jews will sow envy the relationship that the Gentiles have with God, that they will, that the Jews will.
[time=3111] There will be some who will believe in their heart and confess with their mouth Jesus as what?
[time=3118] Lord, Messiah, and they will then be what?
[time=3122] Saved, they will be saved.
[time=3125] Moses said, you can write this down in Deuteronomy 32,
[time=3132] I will make you Israel, I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation with a foolish nation, I will make you angry.
[time=3142] All right, here's the mind bender.
[time=3144] Here's the culmination of the last 40 minutes.
[time=3146] You ready?
[time=3147] This is incredible.
[time=3148] Maybe you see it common, maybe you knew it all along.
[time=3150] I'm just gonna say it to you.
[time=3152] In the end, it's incredible.
[time=3155] In the end, the Gentiles will be the very instrument by which Jews will be saved.
[time=3165] When in the beginning, it was the Jews who were to be the very instrument through which the Gentiles were to be saved.
[time=3173] In the end, it will be the Gentiles.
[time=3175] It will be the very instrument, the tool, the redemptive tool used by God to bring Jews to salvation.
[time=3182] Now watch this, you think that's a mind bender?
[time=3187] I read over this earlier, but I read over it quickly 'cause I didn't wanna confuse too many people, but look at 11.26.
[time=3193] At the end of this whole thing, 11.26, it says, and so all Israel, it says it.
[time=3203] And so all Israel will be what?
[time=3208] Saved.
[time=3209] Now, there are those who believe that what that is saying
[time=3215] is that all Israel, the nation of Israel, that if you are Jew by heritage, if you are Jew by lineage, there are some who believe that the physical nation of Israel, past, present, and future, that they're all gonna be saved because they're Israel.
[time=3238] And when you begin to disagree with that, then you can begin to be called all kinds of things.
[time=3244] Believe me, I am not those things.
[time=3247] I have a number of Jewish friends who I love deeply,
[time=3253] and I love and have enormous respect for the story of Israel and their special place in the heart of God.
[time=3260] I'll tell you this morning, I believe that nobody, nobody,
[time=3268] I believe John 14, six, that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life, and that no man comes to the Father, but by him.
[time=3277] We don't believe that anybody's gonna be saved in the end until they come to faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3286] And I believe the scripture teaches clearly that there will be a remnant of the nation of Israel, and that remnant representing the nation of Israel will be saved.
[time=3297] And Isaiah 59, verse 20, it talks about the salvation
[time=3304] of Israel and how it will be a result of their turning from their transgression.
[time=3309] Write it down, Isaiah 59, 20.
[time=3312] The turning from their transgression.
[time=3315] And then look at, as you stand, go ahead and stand quietly, look at Galatians 3, 27, 29.
[time=3320] I was talking to Steve Webster this week, and he reminded me of this, just a great, great, great way to end our time on this last topic.
[time=3329] It says in Galatians 3, 27, for all of you were baptized, everybody who has been redeemed, all of you who are saved were baptized into Christ, and you've clothed yourself with Christ.
[time=3343] Now look at 28, and there is neither, there is now in God's economy, there is now in God's kingdom, and there will be now forevermore as it relates to the family of God, there is neither, say it, Jew nor Greek, Jew or Gentile.
[time=3363] All that stuff, all those distinctions, the nation of Israel, the name, gone.
[time=3371] There is in God's new economy, neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are what?
[time=3380] All, one, in Christ Jesus.
[time=3384] And that is an amazing picture, and that is a really quick shot at three chapters that we could go on and on and on for weeks, but I hope that helps, I hope that encourages you.
[time=3394] If you have any questions, please ask.
[time=3396] Let me pray for us this morning.
[time=3397] God, what an amazing story of a people who were in, a people who were yours, people who, because of the hardness of their hearts and the unfaithfulness that they exhibited God, you moved on from them, you put them aside, you allow the church to be your new redemptive tool, and through the church in Acts 10 and beyond, you reach a Gentile, unbelieving world, and now God, as we follow that story through in the end, you bring it all back together, so that all can, those who bow the knee of their heart, those who trust you as Lord and Savior, can experience what it means to be a part of your chosen people.
[time=3437] First Peter 2 says that we are now a chosen race.
[time=3441] We are your people, a new Israel, if you will, and Father God, for that we're thankful, for your love and your devotion and your affection.
[time=3449] We are so grateful to have been grafted into your family.
[time=3454] May you and this great truth be praised, and may God, as we leave this place today, may we not question you, may we allow you to be who you are, and may we allow you to choose how you would choose, and God, may we understand that from our vantage point, it's best for us to follow.
[time=3473] It is best for us to trust, and we'll ask you today for the courage to do that, in your son's name we pray, and all the people agree it and say amen.
[time=3481] God bless you.
[time=3482] (upbeat music)
