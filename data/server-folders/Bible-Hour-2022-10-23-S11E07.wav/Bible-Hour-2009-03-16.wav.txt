[time=494] - Well hi, welcome to the Bible Hour today, thanks for tuning in.
[time=498] I'm Corbin Miller, I've been serving as the worship pastor at Black Hawk for about seven years now.
[time=504] Today you'll see something a little different on the Bible Hour.
[time=507] I won't be at the piano today, and Kelly won't be at the pulp, but we actually had a couple of conflicts with this Sunday.
[time=513] I got to go up north to visit my sister, and Kelly got to go down south to Florida to spend some time with his oldest son, so obviously I'm a little jealous about his location versus mine, I was closer to Canada.
[time=526] But anyway, in our place today I wanted to introduce Chris Lyles, who you'll see at the piano, and Steve Webster, who you'll see in the pulpit.
[time=535] Chris Lyles has been serving in our Tech Arts staff for a little over six months now, and I think you'll really enjoy his ministry as he leads you in worship.
[time=542] And then I think you'll also really enjoy Steve Webster.
[time=545] He's one of the Bible teachers at our Christian school, and he just does a great job teaching through the Bible.
[time=551] You hear him today talk about Romans 13.
[time=554] One more thing before I go, we just want you to know how much we're excited and thinking about Resurrection Sunday coming up April 12th, and we hope you're thinking about it and excited about it too.
[time=564] Perhaps today, if you're watching, you don't have a church home or a place you're planning on going that Sunday.
[time=569] We'd love for you to consider joining us.
[time=571] Just a great time, two different hours, nine o'clock.
[time=574] In 1045 as well, we're going to just spend those hours worshiping our risen Lord and hearing the truth from his scripture about how he's alive and active and present in our lives today.
[time=586] And we just love for you to consider joining us that Sunday, April 12th.
[time=590] We've been going through what we call the preparation.
[time=593] In a number of weeks, we've gone through the temple, the wilderness, the table.
[time=598] This week will bring us to the well.
[time=601] And in a moment, we're going to see a drama that may let you see it through a different perspective.
[time=607] But first, I think it's appropriate that we read the passage where Jesus meets the Samaritan woman at the well in John.
[time=614] So allow me, if you will, to read that to you.
[time=618] Jesus knew the Pharisees had heard that he was baptizing and making more disciples than John, though Jesus himself didn't baptize them as disciples did.
[time=627] So he left Judea and returned to Galilee.
[time=630] He had to go through Samaria on the way.
[time=632] Eventually, he came to the Samaritan village of Sickar.
[time=636] Near the field that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.
[time=639] Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired from the long walk, sat wearily beside the well about noon time.
[time=647] Soon, a Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, "Please, give me a drink." He was alone at the time because his disciples had gone into the village to buy some food.
[time=658] The woman was surprised for Jews refused to have anything to do with Samaritans.
[time=663] She said to Jesus, "You are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman.
[time=667] Why are you asking me for a drink?" And Jesus replied, "If you only knew the gift God has for you and who you were speaking to, you would ask me, and I would give you living water." "But sir, you don't have a rope or a bucket," she said.
[time=682] And this well is very deep.
[time=683] Where would you get this living water?
[time=685] Besides, do you think you're greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us this well?
[time=690] How can you offer better water than he and his sons and his animals enjoyed?
[time=695] Jesus replied, "Anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again, but those who drink the water I give will never be thirsty again." It becomes a fresh, bubbling spring within them, giving them eternal life.
[time=709] "Please, sir," the woman said, "give me this water, then I'll never be thirsty again and I won't have to come here to get water." "Go and get your husband," Jesus told her.
[time=719] "You don't have a husband," the woman replied.
[time=721] Jesus said, "You're right, you don't have a husband.
[time=724] For you have had five husbands and you aren't even married to the man you're with now." You certainly spoke the truth.
[time=731] "Sir," the woman said, "you must be a prophet.
[time=734] So tell me, why is it that you'd use and assist that Jerusalem is the only place of worship while we Samaritans claim it is here on Mount Gerazim, where our ancestors worshiped?
[time=744] Jesus replied, "Believe me dear woman, the time is coming, when it will no longer matter whether you worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem." You Samaritans know very little about the one you worship, while we Jews know all about him.
[time=759] For salvation comes through the Jews, but the time is coming.
[time=763] Indeed, it's here now when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
[time=770] The Father is looking for those who will worship him that way.
[time=774] For God is spirit, so those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth.
[time=779] The woman said, "I know the Messiah is coming, the one who is called Christ." When he comes, he will explain everything to us.
[time=787] Then Jesus told her, "I am the Messiah." Just then his disciples came back and they were shocked to find him talking to a woman, but none of them had the nerve to ask, "What do you want with her, or why are you talking to her?"
[time=801] The woman left her water jar beside the well and ran back to the village, telling everyone, "Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did.
[time=809] Could he possibly be the Messiah?" So the people came streaming from the village to see him.
[time=816] I am the woman at the well.
[time=831] I am the woman at the well, and all I've ever wanted is to be seen, just to have someone look at me and see all those things inside that I know are good about me, but even the best relationships have left me wanting more.
[time=843] A broken well that somehow leaves me thirstier than before, because no one could ever love me like they should, because I don't love me like I should.
[time=854] Because I've seen what's inside, and I know it's not good, or at least it's not good enough.
[time=860] I am the woman at the well.
[time=863] I am the woman at the well, and what I want more than anything else is not to be seen, because I can't take what's in your eyes, the score, the judgment, the hatred, the gossip, the lies.
[time=875] At best you offer pity.
[time=878] The pity disguises itself as caring and concerned, but it reeks of condemnation.
[time=883] Looks enough like love only to remind me what I'm missing.
[time=887] So I avoid you today, not wanting you to look at me, ashamed just to be me.
[time=894] But there you are.
[time=895] I am the woman at the well.
[time=897] I am the woman at the well, and you see me.
[time=900] You really see me, all of me.
[time=903] I look into your well, and I see a reflection of me.
[time=907] All I have ever done, lame bear, no place to hide, but not wanting too high.
[time=912] Because in your eyes, I don't find the things I've always seen.
[time=916] The scorn, the judgment, the hatred, the gossip, the lies, not even pity.
[time=924] There is only truth, truth wrapped in love, and though I could feel condemned by all I know I have done,
[time=933] it is not condemnation.
[time=935] I feel today.
[time=937] It is refreshment.
[time=939] It is hope, hope that all I've ever been, all I've ever done, really doesn't matter.
[time=947] That yes, I am a failure, and you know it, and everybody knows it.
[time=953] But that my failure really has very little significance in the light of who you are.
[time=958] Because you're here to change all of me, to fill my life with you until it overflows.
[time=965] I am the woman at the well.
[time=971] I am the woman at the well, and I want everyone to hear me.
[time=974] Come and meet the man who told me everything about me.
[time=977] And promised to be everything to me.
[time=980] We all need what he has to offer.
[time=983] Because not one of us could ever be good enough.
[time=986] Because no one will ever love us enough.
[time=989] Because no water could ever quench enough.
[time=992] Except for him.
[time=994] I am the woman at the well.
[time=999] I am the woman at the well, and I will never thirst.
[time=1002] I will never thirst.
[time=1005] I am the woman at the well, and I will never thirst again.
[time=1024] You are my supply, my breath of life.
[time=1036] Still more awesome than I know.
[time=1041] You are my reward with living hope.
[time=1048] Still more awesome than I know.
[time=1052] All of you is more than enough for.
[time=1058] All of me, for every first and every need.
[time=1066] You satisfy me.
[time=1070] You are love, and all I have for you is more than enough.
[time=1082] You are my sacrifice of greatest price.
[time=1096] Still more awesome than I know.
[time=1101] You are my glory, King.
[time=1104] You are my everything.
[time=1108] Still more awesome than I know.
[time=1112] All of you is more than enough for.
[time=1118] All of me, for every first and every need.
[time=1126] You satisfy me with your love, and all I have for you.
[time=1137] More than all I want, more than all I need.
[time=1144] You are more than enough for me.
[time=1148] More than all I know, more than all I see.
[time=1156] You are more than enough, and all of you is more than enough for.
[time=1165] All of me, for every first and every need.
[time=1173] You satisfy me with your love, and all I have for you.
[time=1184] And all I have for you is more than enough.
[time=1214] This morning we are going to be in Romans 13.
[time=1218] I know 12 comes after 11.
[time=1222] Kelly got through Romans 9, 10, and 11 last week.
[time=1227] I don't know how he did that exactly, but he did it, and I marveled at his ability to do it.
[time=1233] This morning we are going to go to Romans 13, and as you are turning to Romans 13, go ahead and do that to Romans chapter 13.
[time=1239] There is 9 or so points there.
[time=1245] We will get to about one of them today.
[time=1248] That is about how far we got last hour.
[time=1250] I am going to try to put the rest of it up online during the course of the week and have a way for you to get there on our church website.
[time=1256] I am going to have a conversation about that, but I will not be here next week.
[time=1262] In my capacity here is a teacher at Blackout Christian School with government classes and US history classes.
[time=1268] It seemed appropriate for me to speak on a passage about our submission to governing authorities.
[time=1274] That is why we are skipping 12 and going to 13.
[time=1276] Steve Longbrake will be here next week talking about Romans 12.
[time=1280] I would encourage you to return to hear him talk about Romans 12, a beloved passage by each of us.
[time=1287] Let me ask you to stand again if I could, the last time you will stand this morning.
[time=1292] In honor of God's Word, we are going to read the first seven verses of Romans 13, and see what is in store.
[time=1300] This is a very full passage.
[time=1302] Lots of questions will jump to your mind, and I hope to at least move toward and answer this morning about what do we do in light of what God has said here.
[time=1311] Romans 13, 1 through 7.
[time=1314] Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except from God,
[time=1320] and those that exist have been instituted by God.
[time=1324] Therefore, whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.
[time=1332] Rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad.
[time=1336] Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority?
[time=1339] Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval.
[time=1343] For he is God's servant, for you are good, but if you do wrong be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain.
[time=1350] He is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.
[time=1357] Therefore, one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath, but also for the sake of conscience.
[time=1364] For because of this you pay taxes.
[time=1368] The authorities are ministers of God, it's a thing of this very thing.
[time=1374] Pay to all what is owed to them, taxes to whom, taxes are owed, revenue to whom, revenue is owed, respect to whom, respect is owed, honor to whom, honor is owed.
[time=1387] You may be seated.
[time=1392] In these first seven verses we see God setting out before us the proper frame or a way for us to understand the authorities that he's put in place.
[time=1405] What are they to do?
[time=1406] How are they to function?
[time=1407] What is their role in our lives?
[time=1409] If you're looking at that passage in your Bibles before you, 13 one through seven, you'll notice, as I did, in that passage that God's name shows up eight times in one through seven.
[time=1421] I submit to you that he is the focus of the passage and not governors or mayors or presidents or congressmen.
[time=1429] That the main takeaway for you now this morning is that it's letter one.
[time=1436] It's number A, no.
[time=1437] It's Roman numeral one in your notes that there is a Lord over authority.
[time=1442] That's the observation that we make from Romans 13 one through seven that God is the one who set his authorities in place and they serve him.
[time=1451] That's the takeaway.
[time=1453] That's the undeniable message of those first seven verses that God, there is a God and he has placed authorities over us.
[time=1461] He has placed them over us for several reasons that we'll talk about this morning over the next few minutes.
[time=1467] But that's the message. God is the focus of these verses, not the authorities, not the ones that were supposed to be in subjection two.
[time=1475] Look at verse one with me, if you would, please, Romans 13 and verse one.
[time=1480] Let every person be subject to the governing authorities.
[time=1485] To be subject to authorities means that we have a thoroughly submissive posture to them.
[time=1494] That our way of living, our MO, the way we conduct our lives is to be consistently submissive to those that God has placed to those that God has placed in our lives as authorities.
[time=1509] And we do that, friends, because of what it says later on in the passage.
[time=1513] Go with me, if you would, down, I made some notes here as I was reading it the first time.
[time=1518] Go with me, please, to verse five, 13, five.
[time=1525] Therefore, one must be in subjection not only to avoid God's wrath.
[time=1533] There's a lot at stake. It says, if you do what's wrong, Paul says, be afraid.
[time=1537] And if you do not submit or subject yourselves, if we don't submit or subject ourselves to the authorities that God's put in place, then we should fear his wrath.
[time=1547] That'll get your attention.
[time=1550] So automatically, Paul's making much of this whole idea that how we behave toward authority ought to matter.
[time=1557] It ought to matter to us in every way, because Paul makes a very big deal by saying a phrase like that as to what's our posture to be toward these people.
[time=1568] Look at verse one, again, if you would, please.
[time=1571] For there is no authority, except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.
[time=1578] The word "instutid" there means deliberately placed.
[time=1581] God placed authorities in your life in a deliberate place.
[time=1588] That's why the wrath comes in later in the passage.
[time=1591] To set those things aside is serious, very serious.
[time=1595] They've been instituted by God, and the word there, again, is to deliberately place, to order, to command.
[time=1603] From Psalm 84, we read that the God is the God of armies.
[time=1606] Lord God Almighty is a way for us to translate the God is the God of armies.
[time=1612] He has power. He has authority.
[time=1615] And that God of authority has placed persons in subjection to himself that we should submit ourselves to.
[time=1622] And that's the order. In fact, you might want to draw that little outline on that page of notes somewhere.
[time=1629] Here is the order. God places authorities under himself, and we place ourselves under those authorities.
[time=1636] That's the order of things.
[time=1638] When that order gets tangled up or inverted in any way, our lives are very, very confused.
[time=1646] Would you all do that, please?
[time=1647] God, authorities, and then ourselves. That's the order that God has put in place.
[time=1652] And the fact, the words he uses in this passage in the first two verses make that very, very plain.
[time=1659] Now, that order, as we all know, can get confused sometimes.
[time=1664] Sometimes authorities don't submit themselves to God who placed them in authority in the first place.
[time=1669] And that leads to some very interesting questions that we'll talk about in a few minutes.
[time=1673] That's what God's put in place. God, authorities, and then you and I, under their authority.
[time=1679] Look at verse two, please.
[time=1683] Therefore, whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, what God has put in place again.
[time=1693] And those who resist will incur judgment. There it is again.
[time=1698] So this is Paul's first shot at it with us.
[time=1702] His first shot at it is that there's going to be judgment if you don't do what God says to do.
[time=1707] When God says there's going to be judgment, I'm choosing to believe him.
[time=1710] He means what he says. There'll be judgment.
[time=1713] Look at verse two with me. This word for oppose or resist literally translated.
[time=1718] It means anti-establishment.
[time=1721] God's established things. He's tossowed them in the Greek.
[time=1725] And there are those who are anti-tossow.
[time=1728] Anti-tossomized, the word there. So watch this.
[time=1731] The word for establish or to place is tossow.
[time=1735] God places things there.
[time=1737] There are those that are anti-tossow, my, that say I'm anti-establishment.
[time=1742] And the you and I are called by God to submit to authorities.
[time=1746] And that word is hupo, tossow.
[time=1749] That word means deliberately beneath what God's put in place.
[time=1754] All those words are related, I think, intentionally.
[time=1757] To show us, place yourself, says Paul.
[time=1759] He says deliberately as God deliberately put these things in place, God deliberately places people in our lives intentionally for a reason.
[time=1767] So we also ought to also deliberately put ourselves beneath them.
[time=1773] All those words are related intentionally, I think, for a reason to communicate to you and I how we ought to live our lives.
[time=1780] But we have some questions now.
[time=1782] You've already begun to ask yourself these questions.
[time=1785] Two things I thought of, they're kind of catch all questions.
[time=1790] Letter one, number A.
[time=1795] What's the responsibility of government then?
[time=1798] Does God give them a blank check to use in whatever way they want to?
[time=1802] God puts governments in place so government can do because God can put them in place or for whatever they do, wherever they say goes.
[time=1808] Is that our posture? Is that how we respond to what God has established?
[time=1814] Number two, are Christians to fatalistically, sort of whatever you say,
[time=1821] to fatalistically defer to authorities no matter what?
[time=1826] In an unthinking, kind of uncritical way, is that our posture?
[time=1830] So the two questions were, can government do whatever they want because God put them in place?
[time=1834] And number two, are we to kind of fatalistically say, well, they're the government so they can do what they want?
[time=1839] I think we can safely say to both those questions, friends, no.
[time=1844] But having said, that's a fearful thing for me to say.
[time=1846] But let's walk through the scriptures together in a few places and trace out how the people of God throughout our recorded history in the scriptures, how they've behaved toward governments that kind of want like this to God.
[time=1858] No, I don't care.
[time=1859] The first place we'll go is Isaiah chapter 10. Go ahead.
[time=1864] Isaiah 10.
[time=1867] Here's the context, I'll set it up for you.
[time=1870] The northern kingdom of Israel falls to Assyria in 722 B.C.
[time=1876] And God is using Assyria to judge the northern kingdom for their wickedness that's excessive.
[time=1883] You can read about it in kings, in the books of the kings, extraordinary stuff.
[time=1888] God sends, listen to my words carefully.
[time=1891] God sends Assyria to judge the northern kingdom of Israel.
[time=1896] He is using them, look at what it says in Isaiah 10 verse 5.
[time=1900] I'm using the word there, I'm using very carefully.
[time=1903] Look at what it says in verse 5, this is God speaking.
[time=1906] Ah, Assyria, the rod of my anger, the staff in their hands is my fury.
[time=1914] My fury, God says.
[time=1918] Baseball bats don't win MVP trophies.
[time=1922] The guy swinging the bat wins the trophy. Is the bat important to him?
[time=1925] Of course it is. Absolutely it is.
[time=1928] The basketball doesn't win the NCA tournament.
[time=1931] The guy shooting the basketball wins the NCA tournament, but you can't win the tournament without the ball.
[time=1935] So God says, Assyria, you're not the one holding the rod, you're the rod.
[time=1941] You're the one I'm using to inflict my judgment on this disobedient people.
[time=1946] But look at what it says later on.
[time=1949] Look at verse 7.
[time=1951] He does not sow in 10, this is the king of Assyria.
[time=1954] His heart does not sow think, it's in his heart to destroy, to cut off nations, not a few.
[time=1960] Then it goes on to verses 8, 9, 10 and 11 and say, I've destroyed everything else.
[time=1965] I'll get Jerusalem too.
[time=1967] You're just like everybody else.
[time=1969] I'll knock you down like dominoes, one after the other.
[time=1972] Because I'm doing it. Look at verse 12 of Isaiah 10.
[time=1977] When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will punish the speech, that aforementioned speech, of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes for he says in verse 13, by the strength of my hand, I've done it.
[time=1994] My wisdom and my understanding. And now go down to verse 15.
[time=1998] Isaiah 10 verse 15.
[time=2000] God has a sense of humor.
[time=2003] Shall the ax boast over him who hues with it, or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it?
[time=2011] Of course not.
[time=2012] As if a rod should wield him who lifts it, or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood.
[time=2018] It's not how it works.
[time=2019] Assyria, you're the rod.
[time=2021] I'm using you for whatever purpose seems best to me, and they went too far.
[time=2026] Way too far.
[time=2028] Assyrians were well known for bloodthirstiness, wickedness, and depravity.
[time=2033] And even though God uses them, a bloodthirsty wicked nation to punish his own people, God will hold Assyria accountable, and they don't want to hear about it.
[time=2042] There's no God.
[time=2044] They've confused the order of things.
[time=2049] God is using Assyria.
[time=2051] But Assyria has taken the place of God in their own minds.
[time=2056] Go on with me to the book of Daniel, famous examples in the book of Daniel.
[time=2059] I will not take time to unpack each one of the stories in the book of Daniel.
[time=2063] But go to Daniel chapter 1, please.
[time=2066] Fast forward about 150 years.
[time=2068] In 586 BC, Babylon captures Jerusalem, the southern kingdom.
[time=2075] They had their act together more.
[time=2077] There were some good kings for Judah.
[time=2078] There were no good kings for Israel in the north.
[time=2080] But Judah had some.
[time=2082] And the last king was carried away along with Daniel and his friends.
[time=2086] Jump in with me, please, to verse 3.
[time=2091] Then the king commanded Ashpanaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel of the royal family and the nobility used without blemish, good appearance, skillful in wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding, learning, and competent.
[time=2104] These are the cream of the crop, literally.
[time=2107] He says, give them my food, give them my wine, take them to my classes.
[time=2111] I'm going to Babyloniaize them.
[time=2114] I'm going to give them new names.
[time=2117] This is strong arm stuff.
[time=2118] He gives them names that we all know, Shaddak, Meshik, and Abednego.
[time=2121] They're even their names are changed.
[time=2123] It's kind of a re-education program.
[time=2125] Look it down in verse 5, though, of Daniel, verse 8, excuse me.
[time=2131] But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food or with the wine that he drank.
[time=2138] The king says, do it.
[time=2140] And Daniel says, no.
[time=2141] That's maybe not a really forceful example.
[time=2145] Go on to chapter 2.
[time=2148] Numba Knezer has a dream, has lots of people in his service to interpret dreams,
[time=2154] and they got nothing.
[time=2155] They're striking out, I got nothing.
[time=2156] King, I can't figure it out.
[time=2157] Give us more time.
[time=2158] He goes, no, no more time.
[time=2159] You're stalling them to kill everybody.
[time=2160] All the wise men, including Daniel and his three friends, we're all going to get wiped out.
[time=2165] And here's Daniel's response in verse 17.
[time=2167] Watch how he responds and watch how he prays.
[time=2171] Then Daniel went to his house and made the men are known to Hanania, Mishael, and Azariah.
[time=2178] Jack, Meshik, and Abednego, his companions, and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven, concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
[time=2190] Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night.
[time=2193] And Daniel blessed the God of heaven, and Daniel answered and said this.
[time=2198] Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belong wisdom and might, verse 21.
[time=2203] He changes times and seasons.
[time=2205] He removes kings and sets up kings.
[time=2211] Daniel's posture is submission, but there are limits.
[time=2215] Chapter one is an example.
[time=2217] Here is an example.
[time=2218] Turn the page.
[time=2219] Chapter three, if you need to.
[time=2221] The golden image.
[time=2223] The fiery furnace.
[time=2224] The king says worship my image when you see the trumpets are sounding.
[time=2228] Bow down and worship this golden idol.
[time=2232] And they go, no, I'm not going to do that.
[time=2233] I'm going to worship God.
[time=2235] Here's the person.
[time=2236] I'm not going to worship you.
[time=2237] And they get thrown into the burning fiery furnace.
[time=2239] It says in Daniel 3.
[time=2241] Not just fiery, but burning fiery furnace, which means it's really, really hot.
[time=2246] Verse 3, verse 16.
[time=2250] Remarkable stuff.
[time=2252] Familiar passage.
[time=2253] My daughter knows all about it.
[time=2254] If you ask her, she can tell you the story of Daniel and the fiery furnace.
[time=2257] And these three men, she's got it.
[time=2259] Shout out to me, chicken and a bed to go.
[time=2261] Answered and said to the king, oh, Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=2263] It's almost like they're kind of pitting him like, oh, Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=2267] We have no need to answer you in this matter.
[time=2269] He says, who's going to save you?
[time=2270] Who's going to save you from me?
[time=2271] I'll show you.
[time=2272] I'll burn you alive.
[time=2273] They say, oh, Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=2275] We have no need to answer you in this matter.
[time=2278] This be so.
[time=2279] Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace.
[time=2283] And he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
[time=2288] But if not, remarkable words of faith from these men.
[time=2297] But if not, even if he doesn't, be it known to you, O king,
[time=2304] that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.
[time=2313] So there are limits to their submission.
[time=2316] And there's more examples.
[time=2317] Daniel 6 is the lion's den passage.
[time=2320] Daniel's praying.
[time=2321] King says, don't pray.
[time=2322] He goes, I'm going to pray.
[time=2325] Jealous men throw him into a den of hungry lions that have been starred for Lord knows how long.
[time=2330] And there's Daniel.
[time=2331] And you know the rest of the story.
[time=2333] Daniel 6, by the way, ends with Darius issuing a decree of praise to Daniel's God.
[time=2341] So if the king says, don't pray.
[time=2345] If the king says to a Chinese house church, don't pray.
[time=2351] Don't read your Bible.
[time=2353] Don't assemble together.
[time=2356] Then the government has usurped.
[time=2359] They've overtaken the authority that God has given.
[time=2362] And in that situation, our answer is clear.
[time=2365] Now friends, this is troubling stuff.
[time=2367] And I admit it to you.
[time=2369] And I won't make it clearer for you.
[time=2370] I want us all to live in that sort of place.
[time=2373] We're reckoning with it together.
[time=2375] All I've done is to show you there are limits to my obedience to the government.
[time=2379] Allah Daniel and Isaiah.
[time=2381] Go to Revelation chapter 4.
[time=2383] One more example.
[time=2384] I'll give you.
[time=2386] Revelation chapter 4.
[time=2391] In John 19, we won't go there for sake of time.
[time=2395] There will be no time someday and it won't be my enemy anymore.
[time=2398] I'm glad for that.
[time=2399] Time is my enemy.
[time=2403] Anyway, John 19, Jesus before Pilate and Pilate goes, "Don't you know who I am?
[time=2408] I can nail you to a cross." And he goes, "You'd have no authority unless God gave it to you." That's a direct quote from Jesus.
[time=2415] "You'd have no authority except that it was been given to you." He knows Pilate's place, even though Pilate doesn't.
[time=2427] Revelation 4.
[time=2428] Revelation written by John late for a century.
[time=2430] At this point, Roman emperor worship is pedal to the metal.
[time=2435] The emperors are demanding to be given divine titles to be worshiped as God.
[time=2441] And Christians won't do it.
[time=2443] They will not worship the emperor.
[time=2444] They're going to worship Jesus.
[time=2445] And they say, "I'm not going to worship your divine name, Tiberius, your divine name Nero,
[time=2451] your divine name Domitian," or all the rest of them.
[time=2454] But it's increasingly worse that the centuries go along.
[time=2457] They're demanding to be worshiped as the son of the gods.
[time=2460] In fact, Augustus, Caesar Augustus, rewind by 80 years, means son of the gods, something like that.
[time=2467] So get worse and worse as the century went along.
[time=2469] And persecution of Christians by the Romans was really ramping up.
[time=2474] And John writes his letter to these churches living in the Mediterranean world to encourage them
[time=2480] that these Caesars, these men, these pawns are that.
[time=2486] They're pawns.
[time=2488] Watch.
[time=2489] Revelation 4, 1 through 11.
[time=2491] Let this encourage you, as it's encouraged me, and rejoice in what God has done.
[time=2497] Revelation 4, "After this I looked and behold a door standing open in heaven.
[time=2502] And the first voice which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.
[time=2509] At once I was in the Spirit, and behold a throne." Take note of the word throne.
[time=2514] "A throne stood in heaven with one seated on a throne." I'm fond of saying that this is not a love seat.
[time=2522] Just one person on the throne, just God on the throne.
[time=2527] There's not room for a bunch of people.
[time=2529] God doesn't need my help.
[time=2530] Come sit on my throne with me.
[time=2532] Give me some help.
[time=2533] He doesn't want that from you and from me.
[time=2535] One seated on a throne.
[time=2538] He who sat there had the appearance of Jasper and Cornelian.
[time=2542] And around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.
[time=2545] Around the throne were 24 thrones.
[time=2547] And seated on the throne were 24 elders.
[time=2550] Picky backing on Kelly last week.
[time=2552] 24 thrones and elders refers to, in my view here, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 apostles.
[time=2560] People of God throughout time.
[time=2562] Jew Greek means nothing, according to Paul from last week.
[time=2565] Just bonus coverage there.
[time=2567] "Clothed in white garments, golden crowns on their heads.
[time=2571] From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peels of thunder.
[time=2575] And before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, the seven spirits of God.
[time=2579] And before the throne there was, as it were, a sea of glass like crystal."
[time=2585] Now listen to this, sea of glass.
[time=2588] The sea of glass is in prophetic visions of God's throne room.
[time=2591] It's in Exodus 24 and Ezekiel chapter 1.
[time=2594] It's the floor of heaven.
[time=2598] And the ceiling of the created universe.
[time=2601] And in heaven it's completely calm.
[time=2606] And on earth there's trouble and there's constant friction and the authorities are constantly at war with each other and with us and with the God that's put them in place.
[time=2616] But there's none of that.
[time=2618] Sea of glass.
[time=2620] Isn't that beautiful, friends?
[time=2622] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2624] A sea of glass.
[time=2626] There's no more need for authorities there.
[time=2629] The lamb is the light.
[time=2631] That's why Paul ends Romans 13 with the word salvation is nearer to you now than when he
[time=2638] first believed.
[time=2639] And salvation there means the return of Christ in glory and power and majesty to make all
[time=2647] things new.
[time=2649] That's pretty great.
[time=2651] Go with me please to verse 9.
[time=2657] "Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne who lives forever and ever, the 24 elders fall down before him seated on the throne
[time=2667] and worship him who lives forever and ever.
[time=2670] They cast their crowns before the throne saying, "Worthy are you our Lord and God to receive
[time=2677] glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they existed and
[time=2684] were created." God's throne is mentioned 12 times, those 11 verses.
[time=2690] 12 times.
[time=2691] Who is the authority?
[time=2693] Is it Caesar?
[time=2695] No, says John.
[time=2697] That's the message of Revelation 4.
[time=2699] There is a God on the throne setting all things right in the world.
[time=2705] Even things that defy our imagination.
[time=2708] Even things that press our intellect and say, "Why is this happening?
[time=2714] Why are these things going on?" The message of Revelation 4 and of Romans 13 to you and I, dear friends, is that God
[time=2722] is on the throne.
[time=2724] And my first allegiance must never be to any flag but to God's kingdom.
[time=2731] That's the message.
[time=2733] I pray God would give me the courage to say that under any circumstances.
[time=2738] Under any circumstances, it's true.
[time=2742] There are limits to submission to authority.
[time=2746] There always have been and there always will be.
[time=2748] When that authority does not recognize its place as being put in place by God.
[time=2755] A book, I'll have you write down, name of a book, by Francis Schafer that we go through in my government class.
[time=2762] Each fall and spring semester course, we go through it over nine weeks, it's called a Christian Manifesto.
[time=2768] But Francis Schafer presses these things out in very particular ways.
[time=2773] How is it that Christian people are to behave in light of wicked authorities?
[time=2777] What should we do?
[time=2779] It's called a Christian Manifesto.
[time=2781] I commend it to you in the highest pots of paperback book, 100 pages long.
[time=2785] Very helpful.
[time=2786] And he presses that question out.
[time=2788] Because there are wicked authorities, you don't see God as the ultimate authority.
[time=2792] What do I do then in light of that?
[time=2794] He helps us answer those questions compassionately and faithfully.
[time=2798] So I commend it to you in the highest possible terms.
[time=2802] We're starting to go over it now in my government class and I'm really, really excited about it.
[time=2807] There are two passages here that have very real connection to Romans 13.
[time=2812] I'll go back with you to Romans 13 even away from that.
[time=2814] Go back to Romans 13 with me, if you would, please.
[time=2820] The first note there, Roman number one, was the Lord over authority.
[time=2822] The authority exists, friends, from God.
[time=2826] There's the first point.
[time=2828] Authority is from God.
[time=2829] That's its place.
[time=2831] Point number two, number B, is the authority has been given to us for good, for good, for
[time=2840] an honorable intention, for an honorable purpose.
[time=2845] We've been given that authority for good.
[time=2848] Good there means just that.
[time=2851] Look at verse four of Romans 13 with me.
[time=2857] For he is God's servant for your good.
[time=2861] The word for servant there is the same word that we translate as deacon.
[time=2867] A deacon in the church serves as a go-between between the church elders and leadership and
[time=2873] the people to serve them, to make sure their needs are met.
[time=2877] The same word is used in Romans 13 and verse four that government agents are servants.
[time=2885] Everywhere we go in the Bible, Paul describes himself in his letters as a bond servant of Christ.
[time=2890] He's a bond servant.
[time=2892] That's his posture.
[time=2893] He's a servant of Christ.
[time=2894] That's why governmental leaders are called public servants.
[time=2903] That's their role.
[time=2904] What they ought to behave like and when they don't, weirdness breaks out.
[time=2908] Lots of weirdness for you, for them, all the way through.
[time=2912] It's uncomfortable.
[time=2914] I want to read you a portion of a John Piper sermon from June of 2005.
[time=2926] When we submit for Christ's sake to the civil authorities, remember this authority is a great gift of common grace to the world.
[time=2933] Good for us.
[time=2934] One of the most important phrases in this paragraph is verse four, A, God's servant for
[time=2941] your good, for our good.
[time=2945] What a tidal wave of evil would break over the world if there were no civil authorities for restraint, even bad civil authorities.
[time=2954] In the Minneapolis Star Tribune in June of '05, this story appeared about a town across
[time=2960] the border from the radio, Texas, Nuevo Laredo.
[time=2965] The town has lost its civil authority and there's drug gangs running rampant.
[time=2968] Alejandro Dominguez was the only person brave enough to be police chief in Nuevo Laredo.
[time=2974] Hours after he took office, a salence riddled his body with dozens of bullets.
[time=2980] Next day, the streets were virtually empty, only a handful of federal police armed with rifles and automatic weapons.
[time=2986] We are defenseless to the local attorney.
[time=2989] The criminals are better organized than the authorities.
[time=2992] It's a small snapshot of what the world would look like without God's common grace of civil
[time=2998] authority, says John Piper.
[time=3000] What would you do if 9-1-1 didn't answer?
[time=3003] There were no police, no firemen, no national guard, only gang members stealing and murdering
[time=3009] without any restraint or retribution.
[time=3012] Get that picture clearly in your minds, he says, and then read verse four.
[time=3017] He's God's servant for your good.
[time=3020] I would skip down with you to verse seven.
[time=3026] Pay to all what is owed to them, taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed in honor to whom honor is owed.
[time=3033] I want to take a moment to recognize the people among us who are civil servants.
[time=3037] This morning, if you are a civil servant in any capacity, if you remember the police force
[time=3043] of firemen, if you're in the national guard of the military, if you stand for a moment, let us recognize you and respect you and honor you this morning.
[time=3050] If you're here, would you please stand for any of those positions, police, fire, military service, anyone at all, would you please stand, anyone among us?
[time=3060] Let's praise God for these people, even if they aren't here this morning.
[time=3070] Those authorities exist for our good to keep us from falling into chaos.
[time=3075] It's a gracious act of God to give them to us, and we ought to give them respect, and
[time=3081] we ought to give them our appreciation.
[time=3083] I want to end this morning with a quote from NT Wright about Romans 13, 1 through 7.
[time=3093] Look at verse six before I finish, though, let us see.
[time=3097] These authorities exist, friends, as ministers of God, ministers of God.
[time=3103] The word for ministers there is the same word used of priests in the Greek Old Testament.
[time=3111] Authorities function as deacons and as priests.
[time=3115] So who is their authority?
[time=3117] That's the real question.
[time=3120] And when those authorities start turning the knob and placing themselves above God's position,
[time=3127] then we have some hard choices to make.
[time=3132] It's often supposed that Paul's only political comment is Romans 13, 1 through 7, where he
[time=3140] says that God has ordained the powers that be.
[time=3144] This shows us how far our traditions have taken us away from reality.
[time=3148] In almost every letter, Paul demonstrates that Jesus is Lord, and Caesar isn't.
[time=3156] The gospel of Jesus upstages the gospel of Caesar.
[time=3162] The true salvation is achieved through Jesus.
[time=3165] Not Caesar, but the world needs God's justice, not Roman justice.
[time=3170] With great irony, friends that the cross, a hated symbol of Roman rule, had been transformed
[time=3176] into the life-giving symbol of God's self-giving love.
[time=3181] Paul's central arguments make up a massive outflanking movement against the imperial
[time=3188] talk of his day.
[time=3190] Whatever worship was the fastest-growing religion of its time.
[time=3194] Into that drops the New Testament.
[time=3197] Mark's gospel begins with the words, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the son of God." Caesar isn't the son of God.
[time=3209] Mark is writing to a Roman audience.
[time=3213] His gospel is clear.
[time=3216] Romans reading Mark's gospel saying, "Your Caesar is not God's son, Jesus Messiah is God's son." Why do Paul write Romans 13?
[time=3227] Because of the whole tradition of Jewish monotheism and political thought to which he was heir.
[time=3233] God isn't one anarchy, nor of course do we.
[time=3237] It's fine to point out the wickedness of earthly rulers, but when someone steals my car, I want justice.
[time=3243] It's all very well to say that people in power are self-seeking, but if nobody is in power, the bullies and the burglars have it all their own way, and the weak and health will suffer most.
[time=3252] God doesn't want that.
[time=3255] God has therefore instituted rulers and authorities, even at the obvious risk that most of them don't acknowledge him and only have a shaky idea of what justice really is in order to bring to his world such order as is possible.
[time=3270] Until the day when the rule of Jesus himself is complete on earth as in heaven.
[time=3276] This is the Christian version of the political viewpoint we see in Daniel in wisdom writings of the Old Testament, other Jewish texts.
[time=3285] Romans 13 is not a blank check, a carte blanche for rulers to do what they like.
[time=3289] Paul is not setting rulers on a high pedestal above criticism.
[time=3293] Instead he is reminding them that they have been instituted by God and remain responsible to him for the authority they bear.
[time=3303] Go to Romans 13 with me, and we'll end this morning with verses 11 through 14.
[time=3311] Paul writes his own ending to this message, "Besides this you know the time that the hour
[time=3319] has come for you to wake from sleep, for salvation is nearer to us now than when we
[time=3325] first believed.
[time=3327] The night is far gone, the day is at hand.
[time=3331] Let's cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.
[time=3334] Let's walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness and sexual immorality
[time=3340] and sensuality, not in quarrelling and jealousy, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no
[time=3347] provision for the flesh to gratify its desires." Let's pray.
[time=3361] This morning Father, we live in a weary world, a world that's its own worst enemy.
[time=3369] We struggle to live in a world that you've given us, and under governments that you have established for our good, Lord we need your help to navigate those waters, to know what
[time=3381] it is that we ought to do and why we ought to do it, or maybe recognize and affirm and sing and praise you that you are the one on the throne, and that you are the one who places rulers and their places, and you are the one who has always been King of Kings, and Lord
[time=3399] of Lords.
[time=3400] This morning Father, we need that encouragement, we need to know that you are who you say you are, and that no matter what happens, your position is not in doubt, and there are no conditions on obedience to you, none, ever.
[time=3415] Lord take us away from this place.
[time=3418] Lord, salvation is nearer to us now than we first believed, and salvation, Father, will
[time=3425] be fully realized when your son returns, so I pray with John the Apostle to come quickly, Lord Jesus.
[time=3432] Thank you for that truth, Lord, thank you that you are who you say you are, and that you've given us all things, that your grace is enough.
[time=3442] Thank you for our time together, please dear friends before me, carry us out, Lord, in that grace that is sufficient in our weakness.
[time=3450] We pray all this in Jesus' name.
[time=3452] [AMEN]
[time=3466] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
