[time=288] - Well, hello everybody.
[time=289] Welcome to the broadcast this morning.
[time=291] It's great to have you with us.
[time=292] I wanna take just a moment if I can and invite every one of you watching this morning to come and be with us next Sunday morning.
[time=301] As most of you view this broadcast, it is Sunday morning April 5th.
[time=306] That means that a week from now, it will be Sunday morning April 12th.
[time=312] And that will be one of the most special Sundays, if not the most special Sunday in our entire year.
[time=320] That is Resurrection Sunday, otherwise known as Easter.
[time=323] And it is going to be a Sunday filled with incredible music.
[time=328] It's gonna be a Sunday filled with the incredible truth of what Christ accomplished on that great day.
[time=335] And I wanna just send out a special invitation to those of you who watch many of you each and every Sunday.
[time=342] There are so many of you out in our viewing audience who don't have a home church per se, I mean like a physical building.
[time=350] But you're a part of the church.
[time=351] You know the Lord and you have a relationship with Him and yet for a number of different reasons.
[time=358] You don't attend a physical place on any given Sunday morning.
[time=363] And I want you to know how thankful we would be, how much it would mean to us to have you come and be with us that morning.
[time=369] We'd love to provide a physical place and a physical group of people that would love to have you here.
[time=376] We'd love to celebrate that great truth on Easter with you.
[time=379] We'd love for you to come.
[time=381] And instead of just watching via the broadcast, maybe that Sunday you'll come and be with us live and in person.
[time=388] We'd love to share in that morning with you.
[time=391] We'd love to encourage you in whatever way we can.
[time=393] And we'll be meeting that morning at nine and 1045.
[time=397] And it's gonna be a phenomenal Easter celebration.
[time=400] We're thankful for each and every one of you.
[time=402] We'd love to meet you.
[time=404] If you come please come down front afterwards and introduce yourself to us.
[time=408] We'd love to put some names with some faces.
[time=411] Thank you for being a part of our Bible Hour family.
[time=414] Thank you for tuning in today.
[time=415] And we hope to see you Easter Sunday morning at nine or 1045.
[time=420] God bless you.
[time=421] Have a great week.

[time=647] - Revelation 15 speaks of the praise that we offer God, great and marvelous.
[time=653] By His deeds, the Lord God Almighty, just and true are His ways.
[time=657] He's the king of the ages.
[time=660] All nations will come and worship before Him for His righteous acts have been revealed.
[time=666] Let's lift our hearts to Him and worship.
[time=668] [MUSIC - 97 seconds]
[time=790] My Savior lives, my Savior lives.
[time=842] I know that my Redeemer lives, and now it's said on what He did, my Savior, my Savior lives.
[time=855] Every day, every day, a brand new chance to say, "Jesus, you are the only way, my Savior, my Savior lives."
[time=868] One more time, I know lives, I know my Redeemer lives, and now it's said on what He did, my Savior, my Savior lives.
[time=885] Every day, a brand new chance to say, "Jesus, you are the only way, my Savior, my Savior lives."
[time=898] My Savior lives, my Savior lives.
[time=907] It's a clap for God and praise of Him.
[time=922] Our Father, who art in heaven, how will be thy name, like the kingdom come, that will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=934] My kingdom come.
[time=937] I don't even know what that means.
[time=940] God, I just don't understand prayer.
[time=943] I just want to talk to you, and I want to know you.
[time=947] Really, know you.
[time=950] As a believer, I'm convinced that prayer is vitally important, and I long for real intimacy with you, God.
[time=959] But so often my prayers just feel hollow. Is prayer even about the words?
[time=966] Does it matter where we do it or how often we do it?
[time=969] Does it matter how I posture my hands or whether I get on my knees?
[time=973] Do any of these things even matter to you, God?
[time=979] It seems every time I try to talk to you, it ends up as a train wreck.
[time=983] I get sidetracked, or fall asleep, or just get bored, bored with my random endless monologue.
[time=993] It sounds like such an insult to you.
[time=996] Even now, as I try to talk to you, thoughts are filling my mind like, don't forget to pay the electric bill.
[time=1003] Did I remember to turn in that form to HR yesterday?
[time=1005] The kid's hockey game is at seven, so I've got to remember to get dinner on the way.
[time=1012] God, how do I turn off all these distractions and just talk to you?
[time=1016] I'm ashamed to admit it, but sometimes I wonder, what's the point?
[time=1020] I mean, your word says ask and you shall receive, but don't you already know what I'm going to ask before I even ask it?
[time=1027] And I'm so tired of just dumping my laundry list of requests on you.
[time=1032] I feel like my prayer life has become more like a list for Santa Claus than a love letter to you.
[time=1039] So I give you all these requests and I pray that you will be done, but inside I'm just crossing my fingers, hoping that I can bear the results.
[time=1047] Prayer has to be more than just an obligation, or a desperate plea when I'm in trouble.
[time=1053] And so much more than just a one-sided conversation.
[time=1057] God, I just want to know you.
[time=1059] Really?
[time=1060] Know you?
[time=1061] So here I am, God.
[time=1067] Let's talk.
[time=1070] Hey, I want to just introduce to you this morning a good friend of mine.
[time=1075] He doesn't really need an introduction.
[time=1077] In fact, I know that he's uncomfortable with me doing this, but I just wanted to say this to all of you anyway.
[time=1083] We're blessed here at Black Hawk.
[time=1085] We really are.
[time=1086] Most of you know this.
[time=1087] God has just given us a, whether it's musically, or whether it's, you know, artistically,
[time=1093] or even in terms of those who are able and gifted to teach and communicate God's word, we're really blessed to have a number of folks who can do that.
[time=1101] Steve Longbrake is one of our teaching elders, and Steve has been a part of the Black Hawk family
[time=1107] for over 30 years.
[time=1109] He was on the Black Hawk Ministries team as our school administrator for over 25 years, and served in that capacity and impacted and influenced hundreds and hundreds of lives.
[time=1122] I got to know Steve when we came here 13 years ago.
[time=1125] We were laughing just last week that when I came here in '96, he was as old as I am today.
[time=1133] And 31, it's an amazing thing.
[time=1136] And we've just kind of enjoyed thinking back over the last 13 years, and I am so grateful for Steve.
[time=1147] I wanted to say this to you, many of you graciously over these 13 years.
[time=1153] You have offered, and I know many of you have done this.
[time=1157] You have offered, and you have stayed committed and faithful to praying for me.
[time=1161] It's a very humbling thing.
[time=1163] You've prayed for me.
[time=1165] You've prayed that God would give me courage.
[time=1167] You've prayed that God would hold me up.
[time=1169] You've prayed that God would give me wisdom.
[time=1171] You've prayed that God would keep my heart and mind focused in a good direction.
[time=1178] You've prayed for encouragement.
[time=1179] I mean, you've prayed for so many things.
[time=1181] And I just want you to know today that over those 13 years, many, many times,
[time=1187] your prayers have been answered through Steve and his involvement and his investment in my life.
[time=1195] Encouragement, support, wisdom, direction, the whole nine yards.
[time=1199] He's not old enough to be my dad, I don't think, but he's a father type.
[time=1205] When you think about a father type, someone that you respect, someone that you trust, someone that you admire, someone you'd like to be like.
[time=1213] Steve is that in my life and in my family's life.
[time=1216] We're so grateful for him.
[time=1219] I know you are as well.
[time=1220] He's going to come today, and we're going to continue in our study of Romans.
[time=1223] Welcome, Steve, and just know how thankful I am for him.
[time=1230] I had to start walking up here to get him to stop.
[time=1237] I'm really thankful to get to just look at Romans 12 with you today.
[time=1246] It is an incredible privilege to get to study God's Word and then come here
[time=1253] and share what I've been learning with you.
[time=1256] In order to study Romans 12 and 13, 14, 15, and 16, you really have to know 1 through 11.
[time=1265] I mean, you need to know it in order to glean what you can get out of 12.
[time=1272] And I just loved, I have absolutely loved sitting in church these last weeks, listening to Kelly and Steve break open the truth that's in those first 11 chapters,
[time=1284] then chapter 13 last week.
[time=1286] And I think it's just, it's important for us.
[time=1290] And maybe if you hear the review from my words, a couple of you might connect differently with it.
[time=1295] So I thought I'd just review it because it's so important this morning.
[time=1297] In chapter 1 through 320, God reveals to us our condition outside of him
[time=1313] that the doctrine of condemnation rightfully places me in the position I deserve in my sinfulness,
[time=1321] not the created in the image of the God part.
[time=1325] But in my sinfulness, I'm condemned and that those chapters aren't fun to read,
[time=1333] but they're so truth telling and truth giving that it helps me understand who I am apart from him.
[time=1344] And it's important to understand the doctrine of condemnation.
[time=1348] And then 321 comes.
[time=1350] It's just like, it's like, don't turn there.
[time=1353] I'll just read it real quickly, but this verse, "But now a righteousness from God." But that's all true.
[time=1359] You're condemned.
[time=1360] You deserve separation from me in your sinfulness.
[time=1364] But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known to which the law and the
[time=1370] prophets testify. The righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.
[time=1377] I'm condemned, but then chapter 3 verse 21 through 5, chapter 5 just spells out for me how
[time=1387] justified I am before God.
[time=1390] And I guess relief and joy floods me and it should flood you too.
[time=1397] And then 6 through 8, and you can divide these up different ways, 6 through 9,
[time=1404] middle of 6, middle of 5, but 6 through 8, that section of Scripture talks about our sanctification,
[time=1410] how we're set apart for God. He's set us apart.
[time=1416] And in His Spirit, we're able to be led in an apart-like life, one that's really grounded in Him and
[time=1424] focused on Him and moving toward Him and becoming more like Christ.
[time=1428] And then in 9 through 11, I just love those passages.
[time=1433] I love the fact that I'm a wild olive shoot and He grafted me in to His chosen people.
[time=1443] And then there's no more Jew and Gentile. It's just one in Christ in 9 through 11, so powerful.
[time=1451] And then comes chapter 12.
[time=1456] So this morning, I'd just like to pause for a second and have you contemplate,
[time=1464] have you realized 1 through 11? Is it real in your life?
[time=1470] Have you come to grips with the fact that you were condemned? We're separated.
[time=1477] But verse 21, chapter 3, Christ. But Christ, and He saved us through the blood of Christ.
[time=1489] And now, those of us who have by faith believed, we are set apart and He sees us as righteous.
[time=1501] Past tense. He made us the righteousness of Christ through the blood of Christ, through that sacrifice. And I'm righteous, even though chapters 5, 6, and 7 are true about me.
[time=1512] I flip flop around all over the place, but He sees me as His chosen one, His Son, righteous in the blood of Christ. Do you know that this morning?
[time=1526] I was on my way, actually, I was on my way to meet you, Kelly. We were having an early breakfast this week, and I was driving in my car on 469, and I was praying, and I pray in the car. I do
[time=1539] that a lot. I do keep my eyes open. And I was praying, and I was just begging Him, would you
[time=1545] please help me? I want to know, I don't want to mess this up on Sunday morning. And I'm not kidding.
[time=1550] It was so obvious to me. I just sensed His power, and He clearly was calling me to respond to this
[time=1559] challenge. And that is, make sure everybody understands who they are in Christ one through 11. And if they just discovered it this morning, let them say something about it. Let them do
[time=1572] something about it. Or if they're still wondering, they just heard me review it. They've heard Kelly talk about it, and Steve, and they're still wondering, and not quite there, but they want to know, let them get up now. Don't sit there another moment. And so what I want to do is give you a
[time=1590] chance to do that in a minute. But I got to tell you, there was such confirmation that happened, because later that day, about 8, 3 in the morning, I'm in my office having done a few things.
[time=1602] I hadn't turned my phone on yet. I mean, I turned it off silent, and I looked at it, turned it on,
[time=1608] and there was a text message there. And the text message was from Rick Raber, our elder chairman.
[time=1615] And Rick had texted me in the middle of the night, and it said, Steve, woke up at 4 a.m.,
[time=1622] don't know what this is about. But if repentance or salvation needs to take place on Sunday morning,
[time=1630] do something about that. Those weren't the exact words, obviously. It was clear. It was, it was identical to the stuff that I'd been praying about and hearing, and I thought, uh-oh, happy waltz used to call those double whammies, you know, and if you get a triple whammy, look out.
[time=1643] And so I just want to tell you this morning, if you just now are realizing,
[time=1650] if you're just realizing for the first time that Romans 1 through 11,
[time=1657] you are condemned outside of Christ, but Christ. If you're just now getting that,
[time=1664] if you want to make some kind of profession, or if you want to go pray with an elder, hear the options. I'm going to pray in a second. When I do, you get up, you walk through those doors,
[time=1677] and Kelly or some of our elders will follow you. And if you want to sit in your seat or raise your
[time=1684] hand, I don't care how you do it, but get that right now with God. Our Father in heaven,
[time=1692] I pray. I pray to you, our Lord, our God, our Yahweh, your, you're our provider.
[time=1708] I pray that you would please, Lord, touch whoever it is, if there's anybody,
[time=1715] and draw them to yourself right now, that they'd know for sure. Verse 21 of chapter 3 is true about
[time=1722] them, but Christ died for their sins. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
[time=1734] Well, chapter 12 follows that. And all of that plus this doxology that's at the end of chapter 11
[time=1742] leads up to a therefore in chapter 12, verse 1. And I want to read the doxology.
[time=1754] At the end of chapter 11, don't turn there, please. I'd just like for you to close your eyes
[time=1760] and listen to this doxology that finishes all that stuff in 1 through 11.
[time=1764] And then we'll read chapter 12. Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God.
[time=1774] How unsearchable His judgments and His paths beyond tracing out. Who has known the mind of the Lord,
[time=1785] or who has been His counselor? Who has ever given to God that God should repay Him?
[time=1791] For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory, forever. Amen.
[time=1801] Therefore, chapter 12, verse 1, because that's true, because He's made you righteousness.
[time=1814] Therefore, I urge you, brothers, strong word. I urge you, brothers,
[time=1824] in view of God's mercy, chapter 1 through 11. In view of His mercy, to offer your bodies as
[time=1837] living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. This is your spiritual act of worship. Do not
[time=1844] conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=1852] Then you will be able to test and approve the will of God, His good pleasing and perfect will.
[time=1859] We're going to look at those two verses in more detail in a bit and just touch on the rest of
[time=1867] chapter 12. But before we do that, I wanted to tell you about a little story that I heard.
[time=1874] I actually know this couple. It's a young couple. I work with this young lady, and I was mentioning
[time=1882] to her sometime that I was going to be speaking about Romans, chapter 12, and she said, "Oh, that's special to me." And I said, "Well, I," and she said, "her now fiancé." Before they dated,
[time=1895] I asked her to get together with him to discuss whether they should date or not.
[time=1899] Now, these are going to sound like vows, but this was just to determine about whether they
[time=1905] should date each other or not. Not quite the way I did it, except with you, Nancy. I did that really
[time=1913] well with you. He said this. He said, "I'd like for you to consider this. Are you a woman
[time=1920] who's willing to get involved in a relationship with somebody who's headed this direction doing these things? Is this your heart's beat as well?" Romans 12, 9 through 21. He said, "Are you a
[time=1932] person who will commit to sincerity, openness, and honesty with each other, being real?
[time=1939] Are you a person who's going to be devoted to each other, search each other out, and not other people? Is selflessness going to be high on your list,
[time=1950] serving each other without expecting return?" This is dating, remember?
[time=1955] Joyfulness, enjoying each other and loving God together. He wrote these definitions.
[time=1962] Patience, seeking God's direction and timing, also patience with each other.
[time=1968] Faithfulness, not letting go of that which we both know we can't live without, Jesus.
[time=1977] Hospitality, encouraging community together, spending time with friends,
[time=1983] loving people God tells us to, serving, associating with those in a low position
[time=1990] and any other serving opportunities, living in harmony, striving to be at peace with each other
[time=1998] and everyone, humility, not promoting ourselves, living in a right relationship with God,
[time=2007] living in a right relationship with God, and loving enemies.
[time=2011] Do you want to give yourself to people for the sake of Christ, no matter what they've done to you?
[time=2018] That's what he wanted to know. He said, "The person that I want to spend my time with, that I want to date, an anticipation of a possibility of being engaged, is a person who's going to buy into these principles of life right here."
[time=2036] Are you that kind of person? Do you want to buy into these? Are you looking for the principles
[time=2044] that will reflect the righteousness that you are? Now, not to become righteous,
[time=2052] are you looking for the principles that will reflect the righteousness you really are in Christ?
[time=2063] That's what Romans 12 is about. He says, "I appeal or I urge you, brethren."
[time=2071] He's asking, it's just earnestly asking, it's like begging, "Would you please, I'm begging you."
[time=2080] In View of chapters 1 through 11, what else could you do but live a transformational life
[time=2091] in Christ? In View of all of that, what other response is there then? "I'm in."
[time=2097] He says, "I urge you. I'm prodding you. I'm begging you." In View of those mercies. In View of the compassion that God has expressed
[time=2109] to you because you needed His mercy. It's only by His mercy that we're saved.
[time=2117] He says, "I want you to do this. I want you to offer up your bodies as living sacrifices."
[time=2126] Offer, that's a good word. It's the same kind of word, now this is Greek, not Hebrew, but it's
[time=2133] the kind of word that they used for the priests putting the sacrifices on the altar, that they would
[time=2141] offer those to God as sacrifices for our sins. He says, "I want you to offer up your bodies."
[time=2152] Well, your body here, that, it's a great word too. It's not just my flesh. This word has to do with
[time=2161] my mind, my body, my will, and my emotions. I'll get this, soul's not in there. You know why?
[time=2171] He's already got it. He got my soul. He just offered me to offer the rest of me.
[time=2182] He's asking me and urging me. In View of the reality that your mind live like it.
[time=2189] I urge you, brethren, in View of God's mercy, to offer your bodies. Present your body to Him
[time=2199] as a living sacrifice, that word living. It's like the word resurrection life.
[time=2207] It's the same as the word in Hebrews 4 that talks about the Bible being living.
[time=2215] You know, the word of God is quick and powerful, living and effective. The word of God is alive,
[time=2226] quick, King James, living and active, NIB. It's the only living thing.
[time=2234] And he says, like that kind of alive, which is not normal, you be a living, resurrected life
[time=2252] offered to me. Well, sacrifices are offered to God.
[time=2259] So my question this morning is, in view of that, are you aware of the opportunity you have
[time=2270] to be a living, walking sacrifice to God? I really, I would hope, you know, those burnt offerings,
[time=2279] a whole bunch of that stuff was about aroma. And in the New Testament, the Bible says, our worship is an aroma to Him. It's a sweet aroma. Can you imagine if today he's saying, Dean, I really, you smell Dean, there's a, he put the pulpit up there again.
[time=2303] Active worship. He wants us to live as sacrifices that he can breathe in
[time=2310] and have incredible love for what we're doing and who we are.
[time=2317] What kind of sacrifices? Living, holy, and pleasing to Him.
[time=2328] Holy, a consecrated one. There's purity in there. It's that kind of sacrifice.
[time=2338] I'm setting myself apart for Him. I'm not going to behave in the ways that reduce
[time=2347] my relationship with Him. Pure, consecrated, pleasing to Him.
[time=2354] I love Psalm 147 10 and 11. It says, "His pleasure is not in the strength of a horse,
[time=2362] nor His delight in the legs of a man. The Lord delights in those who fear Him, who place their hope in His unfailing love. Do you know how I can live out of life, the rest of my
[time=2374] life?" Focused on doing things his way, giving up the stuff that I might want to do
[time=2382] because I fear Him and I've placed my hope in His unfailing love. I feared Him because I was
[time=2390] condemned. I've placed my hope in Him because He has redeemed me and now I can walk in light
[time=2398] with Him. It says that this is your spiritual act of worship. I love those words. I mean,
[time=2409] the word spiritual there, that one means true to my real nature. You realize, don't you? My
[time=2417] condemn nature isn't my real one. No, that flesh nature, that sinful nature that I inherited from
[time=2426] sinful people and then chosen even in my own flesh. That's not my real nature.
[time=2432] My real nature is the one He created me to be in the first place. He created us in His image.
[time=2439] My genuine nature is Christ in me. And He says, "If I'll present my will,
[time=2454] my mind, my emotions, if I'll present my body to Him as a living sacrifice,
[time=2461] that it's a spiritual act of worship, that I'm worshiping Him." I love it when we sing worship.
[time=2467] When we collectively sing it, I love that. When I read the word, I worship Him. When I pray,
[time=2473] I worship Him. And part of what I do when I worship Him is live life. I live in anticipation
[time=2482] of bringing Him glory. Are you a holy, pleasing, living sacrifice? We can be.
[time=2499] Then verse two says, "Do not conform any longer to the patterns of this world. In my condemned
[time=2508] state, I was stuck in the form of this world. I was stuck being shaped by this world. This world,
[time=2524] the world system, the cultural system that we're talking about, headed up by Satan but not limited to his presence. There's a culture that has force and power, and I was trapped and being
[time=2539] formed by them." They're still at it, by the way. But I don't have to conform to them.
[time=2545] He says, "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world."
[time=2555] So I don't have to. A pattern is an interesting thing. I worked at a steel foundry.
[time=2564] And for three years, I watched, mostly, participated a little in the people that knew how to make steel.
[time=2573] And one of the shops at the steel foundry was called the pattern shop. The pattern shop was a place
[time=2584] where craftsmen could use their hands to cut wood into shapes that would sweep out
[time=2594] the molds that I helped to make. I'll explain that a little later. To create a mold that was
[time=2600] just the right size, had indentations at just the right places, had recessions at just the right
[time=2609] places so that the steel would come out of the mold in the right shape. The pattern shop dictated
[time=2616] how the steel came out. I always admired those guys. I worked in these molds. The molds were,
[time=2627] we called them flasks, and you'd work on one half and the other half, and then they'd flip the one
[time=2636] over and put it on it. And here's the way it worked. You'd fill sand up in the bottom of this flask
[time=2642] that was concave like this, and you'd ram that sand up pretty hard, and then you'd set chills
[time=2648] in there, big iron pieces of metal and other kinds of metal, and you'd stick those in certain places where they told us to because the pattern was going to put sand right around those things.
[time=2660] And we would put those in the right places. Now we're talking about molds that were 60 inches high
[time=2666] when they're put together, diameter like 60 inches, so you can stand inside these things and ram up that sand. And so we'd ram the sand up, we'd put the chills in, and then we'd put some more sand in,
[time=2678] and we'd put more sand in than we needed. Now hopefully you didn't put too much more sand in,
[time=2684] because to turn the wheel, when the pattern swept through the mold to cut out the sand and make it the right shape, if you had too much sand in there, you couldn't turn the wheel. So these guys got
[time=2695] really good at it, and we'd have these little three-quarter inch pieces of wood, and we'd put just three-quarters inch of sand above those just the way that, and the better you were at that, the easier it was. And that pattern would sweep through that mold and make that thing exactly the
[time=2709] shape that the guys in the pattern shop thought it should be in order that we could pour the steel in.
[time=2716] Are you conforming to the patterns that somebody else has made, or are you conforming to the patterns
[time=2727] that God has made? Are you in a mold that is shaped God's way, or are you in a mold that's shaped
[time=2740] by the 58,000 touches a person has in Manhattan every day. Marketers touch people 58,000 times
[time=2755] visually. They say in Fort Wayne, we get between 20 and 40,000 of those. They're not exactly sure.
[time=2760] We're bombarded by the pattern makers. You get that? They're looking for the opportunities to
[time=2769] shape the mold that they want us to be poured into. And we'll naturally go there.
[time=2775] But don't do that. Be transformed by renewing your mind.
[time=2788] Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your
[time=2796] mind by the renewing of your mind. Remember your mind? Mind. That's a whole part of that body will
[time=2803] emotions thing. Your mind is your heart too. It's the thinking process. It's the biological
[time=2813] function that takes place in the physical brain, but there's a whole lot more going on than that in your mind. It's not just brain. It's brain and heart and soul and emotions and all that stuff in
[time=2823] your mind. Renew your mind with the right things. Change your attitude. How does that grab you?
[time=2833] Change your attitude. At work, we used to think that it was most important to hire people of
[time=2843] integrity. Integrity is important. It's part of your character. But one of the things we've
[time=2849] been learning, and I think I've known this for a long time. I just didn't have the words for it.
[time=2854] You need to hire people. You need to be around people. You need to be partnered with people who have a humble spirit, that have a right attitude. That's what this mind, renewing my mind,
[time=2866] means it changes my attitude to conform to his attitude about things.
[time=2871] Renewing, that means making it fresh, vigorous, renewal of your mind. You get your mind renewed
[time=2882] lots of ways, obviously through this living thing, through prayer, through people. People renew your
[time=2892] thinking. If you're around the right people and they're telling you his thoughts, then you'll think
[time=2898] his things. The Holy Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit of God, causes us as we yield to his leading in
[time=2909] our life. Our minds get renewed. Plus, he's the one who helps us understand this in the first place.
[time=2919] Well, it says, if I do that, then I'll be able to test and approve what God's will is.
[time=2928] His good pleasing and perfect will. If I'll live that way, if I won't conform, I'll be transformed.
[time=2936] I'll live like him. Transformation. I was transformed into Christ.
[time=2942] Transformed by renewing my mind is a process. Know that Greek word metamorphosis. We get
[time=2953] metamorphosis from the word for transformation. I'm sure you've heard it before. It really isn't about the butterfly on the other end. It's about the process that you're going through in the cocoon caterpillar as you're in the process of transforming your thinking and your mind
[time=2968] so that you think his thoughts. His ways aren't my ways, he says, in Isaiah. I have to study them
[time=2974] and know them. So if I'm in the cocoon, I'll get this. I love this. Lori helped me with this this
[time=2980] week. In righteousness, he sees me as the butterfly I'm going to be. In process, while I'm transforming,
[time=2991] you don't see that. I don't either. In process, I'm conforming to the image of Christ.
[time=2999] I'm in the conforming process. I move through my life conforming to the image of Christ. And when
[time=3006] I'm with him, butterfly, completely, I'll see it too. You're going to see what I was supposed to look
[time=3017] like, what I was supposed to be like. But while in process, are you renewing your thinking
[time=3025] while you're in this transformational process?
[time=3028] He says that if you are, then you can test, you can discern his will. I used to tell people this
[time=3038] all the time. They'd want to know his will about this or that. I'd just say, are you doing Romans 1 and 2, 12, 1 and 2? If you're in the process of transformation, if you've presented your body
[time=3049] as a living sacrifice, don't worry about it. You can see his will when you look back.
[time=3053] You don't have to know which house. If he wants you to know which house, he can get in the burning
[time=3059] bush. You don't have to know which job. If he wants you to know, he can tell you, and he might.
[time=3068] He reveals himself, but doesn't do that all the time. I just want people, you want to know the will of God? Live a sacrificial life for him and look back. And you go, man, he did. Wow, he did that.
[time=3082] You can test and approve. As I'm moving through a life sacrificed for him, I'm going to do some
[time=3090] things that I go, this isn't right. Something's not right here. Yes, Steve, you made it a left turn.
[time=3095] And then I can move here. And then I can move here. And when I'm testing and approving his will, I get his stamp of approval and I can look back and you can see it was good. Even the hardest things
[time=3108] you look back and you see the value in it.
[time=3113] His perfect will. It's his genuine, complete, mature will.
[time=3126] Well, we need each other versus three through eight. We need each other. You need me. I need you
[time=3136] in this transformational process of life where we're sacrificing ourselves to God together. We
[time=3144] need each other. We need to live those principles out that that young man wrote down for his bride
[time=3150] to be. I mentioned the steel foundry before. As I told you, we made those molds. Well, at the same
[time=3164] time that the molds were getting made, the scrap metal was collected from all over the place and the metal just knew how much of this and how much of that, out of the scrap. Those guys blew me away. And then the iron ore, we had some iron too and we'd mix all that stuff together and put it in these big furnaces and just heat it up to thousands of degrees and melt all that metal.
[time=3184] It would get so hot in this ladle and the bad stuff would rise to the top. It's called slag.
[time=3192] And there'd be somebody, I had to do this some, where you'd scrape the slag off the ladle.
[time=3199] They didn't tell me the first time that you wear a big heat coat. Those guys set me up for this.
[time=3204] But anyhow, you scrape it off and that slag hits that cold concrete and just explodes.
[time=3210] Have you ever seen those showers of metal in a foundry that you see pictures of? It's like that.
[time=3214] If somebody scrapes a slag off, then we pour it into the mold and it cools at the right rate
[time=3222] and a roll comes out of there that's useful.
[time=3230] It's the kind of thing that they use to roll sheet metal out. They have two other things we made and then metal comes between the two things that we made and sheet metal and other kinds of bars and those kinds of things. They put in the scrap and the iron ore. They melt it.
[time=3246] They scrape off the slag while we're making the molds. We pour it into the molds and steel comes
[time=3253] out. Really useful good steel. Iron ore scrap were made in his image but sinners.
[time=3262] There's scrap in that condemned person.
[time=3272] God melted my heart and he took off the scrap. He just took all the slag off me and he seized me
[time=3286] as his child. Righteous and he did all that. I get to choose
[time=3299] whose mold I get poured in. I want to be shaped like him. I want to be shaped by him
[time=3313] and I want to be shaped like him and we can be
[time=3322] with renewed minds and living sacrificial lives. I'm not going to pray. I just want to read
[time=3332] a little bit from Hebrews 13. But before I do that I'd like for you to join in me with me in
[time=3339] something. Some of you will remember this. Others might not. One way you can renew your mind
[time=3348] is to read his word. And I just for some reason this little song came to my mind this weekend.
[time=3353] And so those of you that have sung it, I know a lot of elementary kids did around here. Please
[time=3359] join me. Matthew Mark Luke John Acts Romans 1st and 2nd Corinthians Galatians Ephesians Philippians
[time=3371] Colossians. Nobody's joining. 1st and 2nd Thessalonians. 1st Timothy. 2nd Timothy.
[time=3379] Titus Philemon. Hebrews and James. 1st Peter. 2nd Peter. 3 John's Jude and Revelation.
[time=3391] I want to know where things were in the Bible. So I learned a song that the kids learned here.
[time=3398] Some of you cowards knew that song you just did not sing out loud.
[time=3401] I'd encourage you to know the Bible. Know the Holy Spirit.
[time=3410] Know the people that give you the right counsel. Live a sacrificial life. Be in his mold.
[time=3421] When I finish this you can just get up and walk out. May the God of peace
[time=3434] who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus.
[time=3446] That great shepherd of the sheep. Equip you with every good, with everything good for doing his will.
[time=3456] And may he work in us what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ. To whom be glory forever and
[time=3469] ever. Amen.
