[time=57] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[time=94] Hosanna in the highest.
[time=103] Hello everybody, welcome to the broadcast this morning.
[time=117] It's great to have you with us on the Bible Hour.
[time=120] My name is Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=125] And as many of you watch this broadcast this morning, it's Easter Sunday.
[time=130] And what an amazing day this is, Resurrection Sunday.
[time=134] And I want to just encourage you this morning as you prepare to watch.
[time=138] I was thinking about it, driving in this morning, there are really two extremely significant
[time=144] events that take place in the life of our Lord.
[time=148] Two significant events that really make Him, if you will, who He is.
[time=154] Who He was then, who He is today and who He always will be.
[time=159] And that is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[time=162] One is that He was born to a virgin.
[time=166] That is something that is absolutely not only miraculous, but absolutely pertinent as well
[time=172] to the story of Christ and the very foundations of our faith.
[time=177] He was born to a young gal who was a virgin, who was, if you will, implanted with by the
[time=185] Spirit of God, the person of Christ, that if that doesn't happen, then He's not so miraculous.
[time=195] Then the foundations of our faith are absolutely shattered, really.
[time=200] The other significant thing, and it's what we celebrate on Easter, is the fact that He defeated death.
[time=207] He really did.
[time=208] He defeated death.
[time=209] He walked out of a tomb three days after He was murdered and buried in that tomb.
[time=215] And because of that, all that He promised, because of that, all that He taught, because of that, everything that He stood for is true.
[time=224] And we celebrate that on Resurrection Sunday, and I am so grateful for the fact that everything
[time=230] we believe, everything we teach, all that there is in the Scriptures, it really is true.
[time=236] And it really does transform and change lives.
[time=239] We really do have hope.
[time=241] The Apostle Paul said in the Epistles that if the Lord had not defeated death, if the
[time=247] Resurrection were not true, then all of our faith would be futile.
[time=253] And how thankful am I today that our faith isn't futile.
[time=257] Hey, I hope you'll come this morning.
[time=259] Even as you watch, there's still time for you to come and join us at our 9 and 1045 services on Resurrection Sunday morning, it is going to be an absolute celebration of
[time=270] the life that Jesus makes possible by the fact that He defeated death and conquered Satan,
[time=277] and we can't wait to celebrate that today.
[time=279] Come and be with us, 9 and 1045 this morning.
[time=282] We'd love to meet you.
[time=283] Come down front and say hello if you come and God bless you.
[time=287] I hope that today as you listen to the message, I hope today as possibly you'll come and join us live and in person, I hope your heart and your mind will be open to the things that God wants to show you and teach you all because of His risen Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus
[time=303] Christ.
[time=304] He's alive.
[time=305] We can celebrate that today.
[time=306] Well, you see these beautiful crosses before us.
[time=311] We're so thankful for the Black Hawk Christian School High School Art Class who's been working
[time=319] on this project kind of all semester.
[time=322] They've each made individual crosses and then before our eyes this morning kind of assembled them first hour and second hour for us to just take in and enjoy.
[time=331] And I'm so thankful for artists like these kids who use what God's given them to be a light in the dark world and to honor God with the gifts that they've given Him.
[time=343] Behind each cross is a story though, and this morning we have a video for you to see that will kind of show you a couple of the crosses and what they mean to the kids who made them.
[time=352] So let's watch that together.
[time=377] My cross symbolizes God being in the middle of my life and He is always there, like the
[time=406] splatters of paint, the events of my life can seem pretty random and things may happen that I can't control, but God is unchanging.
[time=414] He is always there and his love never fails.
[time=442] My cross represents what Jesus Christ has done for me and my relationship with Him.
[time=449] The wooden cross stands for Christ's death and the sacrifice He made for me.
[time=456] The road leading to the cross is a reminder of going to Jesus each day.
[time=462] It also represents the narrow path that leads to eternal life.
[time=468] The color changes along the path, stands for my growth, and change in Jesus Christ.
[time=476] He truly is the leader of my life.
[time=480] I chose and yours on my cross because one of the main things I have learned in my spiritual
[time=497] journey is that the best way to show God's love is to reflect it through our lives.
[time=522] On my cross, I chose to sing a father to the fatherless because my dad died when I was seven.
[time=528] God helps fill the empty space missing from my dad.
[time=532] I have put on a picture of us together and a saying from a card dad wrote to me before he died.
[time=538] The last thing the card said is, "He is holding me and watching you.
[time=542] I love you always, Dad.
[time=544] I'll always love and miss my Dad, but I also know God is there to comfort me."
[time=552] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=641] >> Well, how about a big thank you to Jesse Smith and our kids?
[time=644] [ Applause ]
[time=650] What a great job and our thanks to Ron Armstrong as well for bringing his screw gun and working on that both hours.
[time=658] He did a great job leading those kids.
[time=661] And we're thankful for their heart and their willingness.
[time=663] You know, we're trying our best with our school to invest in our kids both academically
[time=669] and spiritually trying to give them a real genuine sense of the things that matter most
[time=675] in life and I'm so grateful for their willingness to help us with the project of that nature.
[time=680] So thankful for the leadership that Jesse gave him and thankful that we could share it with you this morning.
[time=685] Good to see everybody.
[time=686] It's good to be together.
[time=687] I'm so thankful for Steve Webster and Steve Longbrake who were here over the last two weeks.
[time=692] And I'm grateful to be able to be with you this morning as we come to the end of our study in the Book of Romans.
[time=699] If you'd open your Bibles this morning to Romans 14 and 15 is where we're going to spend our time today, as most of you know, our attempt has been in the last couple
[time=710] of months or so to just try and glean from the Book of Romans the great doctrine that is there
[time=716] in the Book of Romans not only so that we could understand better the doctrine but so that we could make application of that doctrine in our lives.
[time=725] And that has been a great challenge and a great encouragement to I know many of you as we've spent
[time=731] time in this great book over these last many weeks.
[time=735] And this morning I want to take you to kind of the end of this.
[time=739] I can't wait for this next weekend.
[time=742] I'm so looking forward to Friday night in a weird way, Friday night as dark as that is
[time=749] in a sense, good Friday as we reflect on the great sacrifice and pain and torture
[time=756] that our Lord endured.
[time=758] I think it's important that we remember that and I think it's important that we remember that in a very real way.
[time=764] And so we'll do that Friday night and I just can't wait for next Sunday.
[time=767] We've got a message that we've been working on for a number of weeks and I can't wait to share it with you and all who will come.
[time=774] I hope you'll bring friends.
[time=775] I hope you'll invite family members.
[time=777] I hope you'll be thinking this week about those that you work with and those that you live near, what a phenomenal opportunity next Sunday will be for us to share with them the
[time=787] life-changing, eternity-altering truth about Jesus and what he did.
[time=793] So that's next week.
[time=794] Today, though, we're going to finish up here in Romans.
[time=796] And if I can, let me just start this morning by kind of giving you Romans in a sense and
[time=802] a paragraph.
[time=803] Let me just take you back to where we've been real quick, give you a picture.
[time=806] And I want to give you this paragraph picture because at the end of this paragraph, it'll lead us right to where we're going today, okay?
[time=814] So here's Romans in a paragraph.
[time=816] We've learned that mankind, we started back at Romans 1, we've learned that mankind is depraved, sinful, mankind left to himself, mankind in his natural state.
[time=829] We've learned the scriptures are so very clear that man is depraved and sinful.
[time=834] The immoral man of chapter 1, the moral sinful man of chapter 2, depraved man in his immorality
[time=845] or morality, either way, is made righteous, Romans 3, 4, and 5, by the gospel, by the
[time=852] good news.
[time=853] The good news gets injected into this rather dark scenario and through the sacrificial,
[time=859] substitutionary death of Christ, man is now made righteous, man is now empowered to live
[time=866] by faith and submission no longer to sin, chapter 6, but to the spirit, to the Holy
[time=873] Spirit and to the process of obedience, Romans 7 and 8.
[time=878] When man does this, he is transformed.
[time=881] His life becomes an offering, a spiritual act of worship to God, Romans 12, and he goes
[time=888] on then in Romans 13 to submissively come under the appropriate authorities in his life.
[time=896] Now as we come to the end of Romans, he lives now in freedom.
[time=901] The believer, listen now, the believer now after all of that has this glorious privilege
[time=908] of now living in freedom, complete and absolute freedom in Christ.
[time=917] And in that freedom, he also now, God's word, we'll call him to, we'll see that here in just a moment.
[time=922] He'll not only be called to live in freedom, but he'll also be called to live in unity
[time=929] with the body of Christ, with each other.
[time=932] And in this freedom and in this unity we are to be, we'll see here in just a moment, guided by, and I want you to write this down, guided by love and sensitivity to others.
[time=942] The believer now who lives free in Christ in unity within the body of Christ is now to
[time=949] be guided by love and a sensitivity to others.
[time=955] Why love and sensitivity?
[time=957] Well, I'm glad you asked.
[time=959] That's what you're going to see here in just a moment as we jump into these last two chapters.
[time=964] Let me begin this morning.
[time=967] Keep that in your mind, love and sensitivity so desperately needed now for you and I to
[time=973] live out our transformed lives in the body of Christ, love and sensitivity.
[time=980] Let me read this for you this morning as we start.
[time=982] Would you stand in honor of God's word?
[time=984] Let me read Romans 15 verses 1 to 6, Romans 15, follow along in your Bibles, if you will,
[time=992] Romans 15 verses 1 to 6.
[time=995] It says this.
[time=996] Now, we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not
[time=1003] just please ourselves.
[time=1007] Each of us, verse 2, each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his edification.
[time=1013] For even Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, the reproaches of those
[time=1020] who reproached you fell on me.
[time=1022] For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction so that through
[time=1028] perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.
[time=1033] Now look at verse 5, "Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant
[time=1039] you the church at Rome, grant you the church here at Blackhawk, to be of the same mind
[time=1047] with one another, according to Christ Jesus, so that with one accord you may with one voice
[time=1056] glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1061] Father we stand before you this morning and we are hopeful God and we are prayerful this morning that these things, these truths that we've just read about here, would come to
[time=1072] fruition in our lives as we attempt God with your help to live out this truth.
[time=1078] May we be a people who are deeply devoted not only to you, God, but to each other and may our devotion to each other cause us to grow.
[time=1086] May our devotion to each other elicit sensitive and loving responses from us as we live this
[time=1094] life together in an effort to make much of you and reach those God that you've called us to reach and love with the gospel, the life-changing, eternity-altering truth of the gospel.
[time=1107] Give a strength and wisdom today and insights so that we can do this in a way that would honor you in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1115] You can be seated.
[time=1119] We've entitled a message this morning, can we all get along and let me begin by just saying this of all the qualities that God has given to the church and think about that.
[time=1128] Think of the qualities that God has given to the church.
[time=1132] The church is redemptive.
[time=1134] The church is hope-giving.
[time=1136] The church is worshipful.
[time=1138] Many qualities we could go on and on of all the qualities that God has given to the church.
[time=1143] There is one in particular that I have always loved and enjoyed and that one quality is
[time=1149] the quality of diversity, diversity.
[time=1155] The church is, write it down, the church is by God's design my friends.
[time=1159] It's not accidental, it didn't just happen, the church is diverse.
[time=1165] The body of Christ, big sea church universal or we could just for the purpose of our discussion
[time=1171] today talk about our own family right here at Blackhawk and this would all be true.
[time=1177] The Blackhawk family is comprised of many different people from different backgrounds
[time=1183] and different cultures and different ethnicity and different experiences and different ages.
[time=1191] God didn't just save 52-year-old white American middle class people, did he?
[time=1199] That was an honest question, did he?
[time=1201] No.
[time=1202] Thank you.
[time=1203] It's not how we did it and I know sometimes when this is all you've known, it's why I'm
[time=1211] so encouraged and that's why I continue to ask so many of you to be so very willing to go, to get out of here.
[time=1219] Not that there's anything wrong with here, but I tell you, when you get out of here, when you go across town, when you go across the country, when you go across the world, when you begin to see the expanse and the diversity of the kingdom of God, you begin to realize he has saved and he has brought into his kingdom and that we are brothers
[time=1239] and sisters with an enormously different population of people than we see day in and
[time=1246] day out here and this wonderful place God's allowed us to be.
[time=1251] God didn't just save 52-year-old white American middle class people and because we're all
[time=1257] so different, guess what we have to work so hard at and be so mindful of?
[time=1264] The answer comes in the last word of this quote I want to read to you right here.
[time=1270] You can follow along on the screen.
[time=1272] The diversity of the church displays Christ's power to bring together dissimilar people
[time=1280] in genuine and lasting what?
[time=1282] Say it out loud, everybody, unity, unity, harmony.
[time=1290] You and me and you and him and those of you up there and those in the corner, everybody
[time=1296] in this thing completely and absolutely together, unity.
[time=1303] Guess what a diverse church has to work very hard at to maintain?
[time=1308] Answer unity.
[time=1311] What is unity?
[time=1312] You could define it a lot of different ways.
[time=1315] I just wrote this down this week, we're drastically different, but we love each other deeply and
[time=1322] we're going to bend with each other whenever we might need to.
[time=1326] We're going to defer to each other whenever that might be necessary.
[time=1330] We're going to embrace the differences that each of us embody in an effort to further
[time=1337] that which God has called all of us to do.
[time=1341] Does that make sense?
[time=1343] I love this opportunity in this completely and absolutely together.
[time=1347] So follow me here.
[time=1349] While I love the idea and I do, while I love this idea and the opportunity for diversity,
[time=1356] guess what Satan uses?
[time=1358] Guess what Satan attacks in his effort to destroy the church and its unity?
[time=1364] He attacks its diversity.
[time=1368] Do you follow that?
[time=1371] Satan attacks our diversity in order to destroy our, say it, unity, examples.
[time=1382] Right here in this room this morning, I know for a fact that there would be some who would
[time=1391] say this or this would be very consistent with their experience and their mindset based
[time=1397] on kind of how they grew up or where they grew up or what they got taught.
[time=1402] There are some who would very genuinely say to you that they really feel strongly because
[time=1410] of how they were raised and what they were taught that because God deserves our best, they always got taught that you'd wear a coat and tie to church.
[time=1422] And they got taught that and it meant a lot to them and it still means a lot to them and again, some Sunday school teacher or a well-meaning parent or grandmother taught them that God
[time=1433] deserves our best and a coat and tie is your best so you go with that coat and tie and
[time=1439] you give God your best and that that meant a lot to God.
[time=1444] And there could be somebody, I mean literally, like here this morning, there could be somebody
[time=1450] like one cue away from that person who having heard that would kind of say wow, that's interesting
[time=1461] because where I grew up and back in that day in our situation we didn't have enough money
[time=1471] for coats and ties.
[time=1475] In fact, they always taught me that God didn't really care, that it didn't matter to God
[time=1483] and so we just wore jeans and sometimes in the summer we wore shorts and I just thought
[time=1490] that was okay.
[time=1494] So who's wrong?
[time=1496] I mean, who's committing sin there?
[time=1501] Anybody?
[time=1502] Not really, they're just what, different and they feel strongly about it and we'll talk
[time=1510] about later how sometimes in the feeling strongly sometimes we communicate poorly but understand
[time=1516] the differences right here in this room.
[time=1523] Somebody in the room this morning could say you know what, pretty much every night of my life growing up my mom and dad had a glass of wine with dinner and my dad had a couple
[time=1534] of beers on the weekend, usually after he went fishing or played golf.
[time=1540] And my mom and dad, you'd have to have known them, they loved the Lord deeply and they taught
[time=1550] us as kids growing up, how to love the Lord and how to exercise great moderation in all
[time=1558] things.
[time=1559] There's people right here in this room this morning who could say that, I could say that
[time=1566] very genuinely and very honestly, very openly and two pews away, maybe in the next section
[time=1573] of the hour, there's a gal who could say to them, you know what, my dad was an alcoholic.
[time=1583] He spent most of his adult life every day and every night drunk and he beat my mom and
[time=1590] me for 15 years and your wine at dinner and your weekend beers offend me, it's hard for
[time=1601] me, I don't get it.
[time=1606] See, Satan attacks our diversity in an effort to destroy our what, say our unity.
[time=1619] Somebody would say, and people have said, and I love it when they share with me, I really do.
[time=1624] I got saved in a church somebody, many of you in this room could say this, I got saved in a church where all the music was played on an organ or piano and all the songs were
[time=1633] traditional hymns and it was those hymns and that organ, Kelly, that taught me how to
[time=1639] love and appreciate Jesus.
[time=1644] And I know many of you who feel that way, I'm actually, I actually sort of feel that
[time=1650] way too at times, the older I get, I look back and can so connect with certain styles and forms of music and what I learned at those times, it's a beautiful thing.
[time=1660] But a couple pews over, I guarantee you there's a guy or a gal who would kind of scratch their
[time=1666] head and say, wow, that's interesting.
[time=1668] I got saved in a heavy metal hard rock church plant where every Sunday they had 10 electric
[time=1676] guitars, they had smoke pyrotechnics and a mosh pit and it was in that mosh pit that
[time=1685] I experienced community for the first time and it was those electric guitars that led
[time=1691] me to a deeper love for Jesus.
[time=1699] And you're like sitting 15 feet from each other.
[time=1704] And how are we doing with all those differences?
[time=1708] I'm black somebody could say.
[time=1711] I'm black and I like to stand when it comes to worship.
[time=1716] I like to move with my worship music, it's the other word for dance.
[time=1722] I like to sing loud, I like to clap, I like to shout, I like to talk to the preacher when
[time=1728] he's preaching, do I hear an amen?
[time=1730] There's a lot of white amens right there.
[time=1734] And somebody could say, well, I'm white and I like to sit quietly, preferably.
[time=1742] You hear an amen?
[time=1747] Love you back there.
[time=1752] I'm Latino or Hispanic somebody could say and I'm expressive and somebody could say, well,
[time=1758] I'm Asian and I'm not so much expressive and somebody could say, I'm older.
[time=1764] And I kind of like quiet more reflective times of worship and somebody could say, I'm younger
[time=1770] and I enjoy multiple sensory worship experiences all going on at once for some of you in the
[time=1777] room this morning, those kids building that cross drove you crazy.
[time=1784] And for others of you, it was refreshing.
[time=1787] Wow, Satan attacks our, say it with me, Satan attacks our diversity in order to destroy
[time=1795] our unity.
[time=1797] This is a problem.
[time=1799] This is a problem in the church today.
[time=1801] It's been a problem in the church for years.
[time=1803] It'll probably keep being a problem I would suspect and we've got to figure out how to
[time=1809] better deal with this in a way that brings glory to him and doesn't take away from us the opportunity God's given us as a diverse family to do incredible things on his behalf.
[time=1822] The Bible does not, I don't want to pop anybody's bubble here.
[time=1825] The Bible does not give a dress code for Sunday mornings.
[time=1830] The Bible doesn't speak to how long your hair should be.
[time=1833] The Bible doesn't designate which musical instruments should or shouldn't be used.
[time=1840] The Bible doesn't even speak really to style of worship within the 70 minutes.
[time=1844] I mean, where the 70 minutes come from in the first place?
[time=1848] We're just making this up as we go.
[time=1851] The Bible's so silent on so many things that we're so boisterous about because you know
[time=1858] what?
[time=1859] We've all got opinions and we've all got preferences and we all got taught to do things a certain
[time=1865] way and we've got to be extremely careful with how we handle this.
[time=1870] Paul is addressing in Romans 14 and 15 this very issue and let me just explain to you how
[time=1877] it's playing out here.
[time=1879] Write a few things down here, three things.
[time=1881] Number one, we had an issue with, he was addressing an issue with converted Jews.
[time=1887] Understand that there were Jewish men and women who came to faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1892] The gospel had been preached and there were those who were literally saved out of the synagogue and now they weren't stuck in religion.
[time=1902] Now all of a sudden they found themselves in a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1907] But the problem was is that for their whole life, I mean imagine if you're 40 years old
[time=1913] and for your whole life you've observed dietary laws, your whole life you've observed the
[time=1919] Sabbath for your whole life you've known that you needed to make an offering for your sins.
[time=1925] And now at 40 all of a sudden one day you hear the gospel.
[time=1928] It resonates with your soul, your respond to the moving of the Holy Spirit in your heart and you dive in fully devoted, fully surrendered.
[time=1937] But your whole life, you wore a coat and tied a church.
[time=1944] You with me?
[time=1945] You had Jewish converts who were really struggling and they're called in this passage, they're
[time=1951] called weaker brothers.
[time=1952] It's not meant to be a derogatory statement, it's just that in their faith, their new
[time=1958] faith they hadn't gotten to the point where they were really able and willing in their
[time=1964] heart to move beyond some of those things that they had grown so accustomed to.
[time=1968] So Paul's trying to help them out.
[time=1971] There's also Gentiles who had come to faith in Christ, converted Gentiles.
[time=1977] And what you have to understand about the Gentile is that in most cases these Gentiles had been saved out of paganism.
[time=1985] They had come out of most of them out of a severe form of paganism in that culture where it was kind of their religion but it was a really, it was a dark deal.
[time=1995] There was a lot of temple stuff going on, we won't get into all the details today because of the age of the crowd here in some ways, but there was some real seedy stuff going on in the temples where pagan worship was taking place.
[time=2009] One of the things that we can talk about that was a huge hang up for some of the Gentiles was that in those pagan temples they offered meat to the idols.
[time=2018] The meat was offered to the idols and then having offered the meat, the meat would then be sold and the meat would come back to the market and people would end up buying the meat and the Gentiles who used to be in the pagan temples knew that.
[time=2032] So Joe and Jane recently converted Gentile, go to the smiths for dinner one night and
[time=2039] the smiths are so glad to have them that they give them filet mignon.
[time=2044] But the Gentile couple knows the filet mignon got offered to the who, to the idols and they don't want to have meat that's been offered to idols and they know all that went on with that stuff so they look at that plate with that filet mignon and they can't eat it and then the couple that offers it gets offended and it's just a mess.
[time=2062] They got dietary laws and Sabbath and offerings for sin and meat offered to idols.
[time=2069] It's a little sticky and then you've got converted Jews and Gentiles who for whatever
[time=2076] reason had grown in their faith, converted Jews or Gentiles who had no problem with those
[time=2084] issues any longer, they had come to a point in their understanding of the truth and they had come to a point in their relationship with the Lord where they were truly free from
[time=2095] those worries and those issues and on they were willing and ready to go.
[time=2101] But now all of those folks are sitting together on a Sunday morning, you know what I mean?
[time=2109] All those folks are now part of the same family.
[time=2112] That group of people I just described is to be unified, to live in harmony so they've
[time=2119] got questions and so Paul writes.
[time=2122] What did Paul tell them to do?
[time=2124] Listen, how were they and how are we to function as believers in a family with huge
[time=2131] differences, multiple preferences and varying degrees of spiritual maturity?
[time=2139] Look at Romans 14 with me, would you?
[time=2142] Romans 14, we're going to pick it up in verse 13.
[time=2146] Romans 14, 13.
[time=2148] Let me read that first verse to you there, Romans 14, 13.
[time=2150] This comes under don't hinder.
[time=2152] First thing Paul says is don't hinder the weaker brother.
[time=2158] Don't hinder the weaker brother.
[time=2160] Therefore let us not judge one another anymore.
[time=2166] But rather instead of judging, determine this, not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block
[time=2174] in a brother's way.
[time=2176] Now as we read through this, I need to say this, you'll sense as we read through this that Paul makes his comments here in Romans 14 to the stronger brother.
[time=2186] And again, don't get caught up in the derogatory potential here.
[time=2190] It's not that stronger means better, it's not that weaker means dumber, it's just there
[time=2196] are some who have come to a place where they are able to, genuinely able in their hearts to see it for what it is and move beyond.
[time=2204] There are some who genuinely in their hearts can't, can't, haven't come to that point yet.
[time=2212] And most of the words that you'll see here, most of what you'll take in this morning are
[time=2218] Paul's words predominantly to the stronger side.
[time=2222] The onus falls on them.
[time=2224] The responsibility to a degree really falls on their shoulders.
[time=2230] Number one, don't hinder the weaker brother, don't put a stumbling block in his way.
[time=2236] You see God's growing, Philippians 1, 6 says he who began a good work and you will perfect it, he will complete it.
[time=2244] Everybody's getting grown, everybody's getting further.
[time=2247] Everybody gets grown or furthered at the same pace you do.
[time=2251] Not everybody gets grown or furthered all at the same time, right?
[time=2256] So be careful, don't hinder them, don't put a stumbling block.
[time=2263] Don't trip them up.
[time=2265] I was thinking about this, oh, the last week or so.
[time=2271] And I'm so glad he's here, I've got a good friend, a dear friend in the back, Del Hartman,
[time=2277] Del.
[time=2278] Can you see me?
[time=2279] There he is right there.
[time=2280] There's Del.
[time=2281] Say hi to Del, wave your hand.
[time=2284] You guys say hi to Del back there.
[time=2286] Great, great guy and a huge, huge supporter and friend of Kelly Bird for years.
[time=2294] I met Del and Agnes when I first moved here, 13 years ago.
[time=2299] And it was probably about 10 years ago that I was filling in on a Sunday morning and it
[time=2306] was a summer Sunday morning and it was hot and it was humid.
[time=2311] And I was still new to the whole Fort Wayne hot and humid thing.
[time=2314] I had a bad attitude that day, I'll admit it up front.
[time=2317] And I said to myself, you know what, I'm going to go and I'm going to preach and I'm going to be comfortable.
[time=2322] So I wore Birkenstock sandals and khaki shorts.
[time=2326] I didn't think it was a big, you know, it was hot, it was humid.
[time=2330] I was tired of being hot and humid.
[time=2332] So I wear Birkenstocks handles and khaki shorts and it was kind of a kid's Sunday morning anyway so I thought no big deal.
[time=2340] And it really wasn't that huge of a deal.
[time=2342] I mean, I didn't get fired or anything like that.
[time=2344] I think there were a few people who didn't, you know, weren't too impressed.
[time=2347] Well, Del, Del comes and talks to me back in the back later that morning.
[time=2355] And the kindest, most humble, honoring way, he lets me know that for him, that was really
[time=2366] hard, that he just felt like in his heart that when he saw me up there with my sandals
[time=2373] and my shorts, it was distracting for him.
[time=2376] I thought, well, I'm no kidding, it probably was.
[time=2380] But it was difficult for him to get past that because he had a frame of reference that just was hard for him to see somebody up on this stage teaching this in sandals and shorts.
[time=2390] And the way he did it was beautiful.
[time=2393] The words that he chose and the way he left me feeling, he didn't say, so if you ever do it again, I'm leaving.
[time=2400] He didn't say you were wrong for doing it.
[time=2403] He just lovingly shared with me his perspective and you know what?
[time=2406] In the last 13 years, I've never worn sandals or shorts up on this stage ever.
[time=2414] And I'm so grateful for Del and the way he did that.
[time=2419] And I'm okay with Del, seeing that from the perspective that Del saw it from, and it was
[time=2427] great with me to not put that block in front of him ever again.
[time=2431] Now you know what today, if Del and I talked about it, Del might say, I said that.
[time=2436] No big deal, maybe it wouldn't be as big a deal to Del today as it was then.
[time=2441] But listen, listen, what stumbling blocks are you putting out there in front of people
[time=2447] in the way that you live your life and the things that you choose to do and the way that you conduct yourself and the rights that you hold on to, the freedoms that you exercise because they're your freedoms.
[time=2459] I was free to wear shorts and sandals, but I've got to be sensitive to the context within
[time=2467] which I do that.
[time=2468] How about you?
[time=2469] Something for you and I to think about this morning.
[time=2473] Some might think I should have told Del to just deal with it.
[time=2482] But look at number two.
[time=2483] I mean that plays right in at number two, not only are we not to hinder the weaker brother verse 13, but look at verses 14 and 15, we're not to hurt the weaker brother either.
[time=2494] Don't hurt the weaker brother.
[time=2495] Look at 14.
[time=2496] 14 says, I know, and this is very important.
[time=2498] Paul says, I know, Paul just steps back from it all and he just makes this really clear for everybody.
[time=2504] I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that what, say it, nothing is unclean in itself.
[time=2514] You understand how big that is.
[time=2517] Nothing is unclean.
[time=2521] The meat offered to idols really at the end of the day because of all that Christ has accomplished.
[time=2527] Paul says to the Gentiles struggling with the filet mignon really at the end of the day, it's no big deal.
[time=2533] Nothing is unclean.
[time=2535] It's all good.
[time=2537] Short sandals, filet mignon, dietary laws, let it go.
[time=2543] Paul says at the beginning of 14, I know this, that nothing is unclean in itself, but to
[time=2551] him, listen, but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is what?
[time=2559] For if because of food, this is so good, for if because of food, your brother is hurt,
[time=2565] you are no longer walking according to everybody, say it, love, told you at the beginning of
[time=2573] this thing, but the way in which we live in our freedom and in unity is when we are guided
[time=2580] by love and sensitivity to others that always love trumps everything.
[time=2587] That's got to be behind your choice and mind when it comes to the exercising of our freedom.
[time=2594] For if because of food, it's like Paul saying, are you kidding me?
[time=2599] You're going to hurt somebody over food?
[time=2602] You are no longer walking according to love.
[time=2605] Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.
[time=2614] Is there any, hey, weaker brother just deal with it in that passage there?
[time=2619] Do you hear or sense any of that?
[time=2621] Yes or no?
[time=2623] No, not a bit.
[time=2626] My priority, you might want to write this down, my priority must be to love the weaker
[time=2632] brother first, not prove a point to the weaker brother too many times, we want to prove points.
[time=2639] Galatians 5, look it up, would you turn in your Bibles, just back a few books, past first
[time=2645] and second Corinthians, go to Galatians 5, if you would, 5, 13.
[time=2652] Listen here, Paul is still writing now to the church at Galatia.
[time=2655] Paul says in Galatians 5, 13 he says, "For you were all called to what?
[time=2663] Freedom.
[time=2664] For you were all called to freedom, brethren, only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh.
[time=2671] But through what?
[time=2672] There it is.
[time=2673] But through love, serve one another.
[time=2675] For the whole law is fulfilled in that one word.
[time=2679] In the statement, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=2684] But if you bite and devour each other, take care that you are not consumed by one another.
[time=2692] So many times, my friends, in this discussion about our freedoms, so many times in this dialogue about our liberties, so many times in the midst of that, we get caught in thinking
[time=2705] that that's really all about us.
[time=2708] We get into this mindset of what I can do.
[time=2711] We get into this mindset, or this thinking of what it really is permissible.
[time=2715] And we forget that at the end of the day, it's not about us, it's about us, it's not
[time=2722] about me, it's about you, and how I choose and how I live and the choices I make in relationship
[time=2731] with you.
[time=2732] I've got to be willing to be responsible for doing that in a way that's sensitive.
[time=2737] Go to 1 Peter 2, go back toward the back of your New Testament.
[time=2743] Go to 1 Peter 2, verse 13, 1 Peter 2, "Submit yourselves," it says, "for the Lord's sake
[time=2754] to every human institution," sounds like Romans 13, "whether to a king as the one in authority
[time=2760] or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and the praise of those who
[time=2766] do right.
[time=2767] For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.
[time=2775] Act as verse 16, act as free men, yet do not use your freedom as a covering for what?
[time=2784] Evil.
[time=2785] And it gets to be evil when in your exercising of that freedom it hinders, or it begins
[time=2792] to hurt or destroy another's, don't use it as a covering for evil, but use that freedom
[time=2798] as bond slaves, that's a great phrase, picture that now.
[time=2801] When you want to talk about your freedoms, and when you want to talk about your liberties, picture yourself as a bond slave of God, honor all people with your freedoms, love the brotherhood
[time=2812] with your freedoms, fear God with your freedoms, honor the king with your freedoms.
[time=2821] Don't hinder the weaker brother, verse 13, don't hurt the weaker brother.
[time=2825] The priority must be love.
[time=2829] And I will say this, let me say this to the weaker brothers.
[time=2834] Let me say this to those of you who are still growing in your faith and may be wrestling with some of these issues, try not to become a professional weaker brother.
[time=2846] Does that make sense?
[time=2850] I want to be sensitive to you.
[time=2854] Do you hear me?
[time=2855] You believe me?
[time=2856] I do.
[time=2857] I want us to be careful with you.
[time=2861] But I've seen this way too many times.
[time=2862] I've seen people who just settle in.
[time=2864] They don't want to grow.
[time=2865] They don't want to get beyond what's comfortable, and they just hunker down and become professional weaker brothers.
[time=2872] And at every corner they're there saying, "Whoa, no, that offends me.
[time=2875] Stop.
[time=2876] Whoa, no, no.
[time=2877] Don't do that.
[time=2878] That confuses me.
[time=2879] Stop." And I know on my side of this thing, God keeps telling me, "Be sensitive.
[time=2884] Be careful.
[time=2885] Don't run them over.
[time=2887] God also calls you to continue in your growth and your maturity with Him, your willingness
[time=2893] to see things, not as I see them, but to see things as the Scriptures.
[time=2898] Paint them.
[time=2899] That'll help all of us in the days to come.
[time=2902] Don't hinder the weaker brother.
[time=2905] Don't harm.
[time=2906] Number three, write this down.
[time=2907] Don't harm your witness.
[time=2909] What do I mean by your witness, your opportunity.
[time=2912] Don't harm your, your redemptive opportunity.
[time=2916] Every one of us has been given this opportunity to in the way we live out our faith here with
[time=2922] each other.
[time=2923] We get to make an impact at the same time on an on-looking world.
[time=2928] And Paul is saying this issue right here can be explosive and divisive and it can hurt
[time=2935] your opportunity in mind if we don't handle this well.
[time=2939] Don't harm your opportunity and don't harm for goodness sake.
[time=2943] Don't harm God's work.
[time=2946] Look at 16 to 21.
[time=2949] Back to Romans.
[time=2952] Back to Romans 16, Romans 14.
[time=2956] Look at 16 to 21.
[time=2959] Do not let what is for you a good thing, your freedom, your exercising of your Christian
[time=2968] liberty.
[time=2969] Don't let what is for you a good thing be spoken of by others as evil.
[time=2975] For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking.
[time=2979] Please remember this, the kingdom of God is not carpet color and music style.
[time=2984] The kingdom of God is not, is not meat offer to idols, shorts or sandals.
[time=2991] The kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit for he who in this
[time=2999] way serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.
[time=3005] So then we pursue the things which make for what?
[time=3008] Say it.
[time=3009] Peace.
[time=3010] Come on to something, you want to dig in on something, dig in and hold on to those things
[time=3016] that lead to peace, not conflict and the building up of one another.
[time=3023] Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food.
[time=3028] All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense.
[time=3036] It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles.
[time=3046] So I want to be really clear here and I'm on the verge of being very confusing and let me explain that.
[time=3051] I just told you, some of you, I said, "Hey, keep growing.
[time=3057] Don't get stuck in this place of being a weaker brother." At the same time, he just told you and I want to reiterate this.
[time=3064] If this is where you are and if there's something going on with me or something going on with
[time=3070] a friend and you come across that and that's difficult for you, don't you dare do it.
[time=3077] Even though maybe what he's saying is that you have the freedom to do it, if in your
[time=3084] heart and in your relationship with him, he's not brought you to that place where you have the freedom to do it, guess what?
[time=3091] Don't do it.
[time=3093] Don't violate your conscience and we'll trust that as I deal with you and you deal with
[time=3102] me lovingly and in unity, God will continue to grow us both and we'll get where we need
[time=3109] to go in the right spirit with the right attitudes and the appropriate commitment to each other.
[time=3118] And my pursuit of a freedom, a freedom I do have is carried out in such a way that it
[time=3125] produces conflict and division within the church, conflict and division that is now seen
[time=3131] by an on-looking world that I've gone too far.
[time=3136] And that's the killer in this whole thing is that the on-looking world who's been told
[time=3142] now for years, the on-looking world's been told that we're all about what, that we're all about love, that we're all about caring for each other, that we're a place to go where
[time=3153] you can get healed up, a place that you can come to be understood and cared for and will come alongside you, come to the church, the on-looking world has heard.
[time=3163] And now the on-looking world looks at the church absolutely as the text said devouring
[time=3170] each other, we're just killing each other over issues that don't even matter.
[time=3178] But because we've got opinions about it, we're going to leave, we're going to write letters,
[time=3184] we're going to be rude and insensitive and create conflict and see division and it's
[time=3193] amazing what's happened to the church because of this issue.
[time=3199] Some might think this is just opinion, I suppose it is, but I look at, I look at, I get things
[time=3207] in the mail all the time at my office, I have conversations with people.
[time=3210] I know of churches that have now been started where they're calling card, I mean the thing
[time=3216] that's so unique about them, the thing that they're promoting and the thing that they're excited about is that they're a church that just does this.
[time=3225] It's just a heavy metal church or it's just a traditional church or it's just a church
[time=3233] for 30-some things, they're all over the place.
[time=3238] And I just, I look at this and I read more about the diversity of the body and the way
[time=3244] God designed the church and I look at those things and I just say no, I just can't, that's not me.
[time=3250] I look at you all and I look at 18-year-olds and brown and yellow, red, black and white, older people, younger people, I think this is a great picture.
[time=3260] It's harder at times, amen?
[time=3263] But I think it's a great picture of what God designed and we need to stay at it.
[time=3269] I'll let you go.
[time=3271] 1 Corinthians 9, 1 Corinthians 6, excuse me, Katie would you put up 1 Corinthians 6, would you all stand quietly, 1 Corinthians 6, let me just leave you with this.
[time=3282] 1 Corinthians 6, 12 and 13, 1 Corinthians 6, look at this, this is great.
[time=3290] Remember this as you leave.
[time=3291] Remember this, my friends, as the days go by, as you think about this conversation, go to the website this week.
[time=3298] After Tuesday, Wednesday, click on digging deeper and think more about this message and
[time=3304] interact with it, with your family, with your small group, with your ABF class, 1 Corinthians
[time=3310] 6, 12 and 13, here you go.
[time=3312] All things are what, say it.
[time=3315] All things are lawful for me, but not all things are what, profitable.
[time=3322] All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.
[time=3327] Anything inherently evil about a glass of Merlot?
[time=3330] Yes or no?
[time=3331] No.
[time=3332] Anything evil about a cigarette, anything evil about a movie, anything evil about a television show, anything evil about the internet?
[time=3338] No, but when they master you, now something that's permissible is all of a sudden not
[time=3345] very profitable.
[time=3348] I will not be mastered by anything.
[time=3350] Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both of them yet the body is not for immorality, but for the Lord and the Lord is for the body.
[time=3361] All things are lawful, verse 12, but not all things are profitable.
[time=3366] Father, God, I pray this morning that we as a family, God, that we as individuals who are
[time=3372] a part of a family that is to be unified and living in harmony with each other.
[time=3377] Oh, God, I pray you'd give us the courage and the humility as stronger brothers to not
[time=3384] hold on to that so tightly that we offend those who could use our sensitivity and our
[time=3390] help and, oh, God, as we struggle at times as weaker brothers, not feeling a sense of
[time=3396] freedom or liberty, God, I pray that we would be careful as Del was with me that Sunday morning.
[time=3405] God, that we would be careful to preserve the unity of the bond of peace that you've given us here in the body of Christ.
[time=3412] God, I pray that we would as transformed individuals who have experienced this journey through
[time=3419] Romans, from depravity to righteousness.
[time=3423] God, I pray that we would live with each other in a way, God, that would make much of you
[time=3429] and in a way, God, that truly would attract and invite an on-looking world to a community
[time=3436] of Christ followers that really do love each other, that really do care for each other,
[time=3442] that really do take care of, not devour, but take care of each other, God, in this life,
[time=3449] in this relationship that you've given us.
[time=3452] Father, God, we thank you for this week.
[time=3454] That's ahead.
[time=3455] What a week.
[time=3456] What an amazing week this is and what an amazing privilege it is for us, God, those of us who know your Son, to be mindful of every step He takes in this last week leading
[time=3468] to Friday, God, may our hearts be stilled and may we as a family with great clarity.
[time=3474] Remember the sacrifice of your Son this Friday night and may we as a family, God, with great celebration.
[time=3481] Come together next Sunday morning, Resurrection Sunday, the day, the event that changed everything.
[time=3489] God prepare us for that day and we'll look forward to it and all the people in the room agreed and said, "Hey, man, God bless you."
