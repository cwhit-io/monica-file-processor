[time=363] Well, hello again. Welcome to the broadcast. We're thankful that you've tuned in. My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving a senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries. It is an amazing team of people,
[time=375] and we are unbelievably blessed to be able to bring this to you each and every week. I'm so thankful for what you're about to see.
[time=383] It was an amazing resurrection Sunday morning, an absolutely thrilling event to be able to be together in that room,
[time=392] to be able to celebrate the great truth of our Lord's resurrection and to contemplate once again and realize the enormous impact,
[time=400] his resurrection, the miracle of him conquering the grave, the impact that that has on your life and mine.
[time=407] It was truly special, and I hope you'll be encouraged today, and reminded of that great truth as you watch.
[time=415] Hey, I want to take just a moment, if I can, and tell you about something that somewhat new on our website that is directly connected
[time=424] to what you see each and every week here on the broadcast. What we've done is we've allowed you and everybody in our Black Hawk family
[time=432] to really, as we say, continue the discussion from the message each and every week. You know, one of my great frustrations
[time=440] in 20 plus years of ministry is that every time I speak, every time I get a chance to teach God's Word,
[time=447] there hasn't been a day or a situation in which I've done that when I haven't sat down at the end and thought,
[time=454] gosh, I wish we could have talked about some more. I wish we could have further the discussion.
[time=459] I wish we could have continued to bring application to the truth that we just spent 30, 40 minutes talking about.
[time=466] Well, what we've done on our website is we've created a link called Digging Deeper, and you can see it right here on the screen from our homepage on the website, and when you click on the Digging Deeper link there, it takes you to a really well-done piece.
[time=482] It's a layout that allows you to just continue to research and think and look through cross-references and write down answers.
[time=492] I'm so thankful to Tom Beckner and the work that he's done on this, Tom has provided each and every week now a chance for you to further the discussion from the message,
[time=503] to further think about what you heard on the broadcast, and not just to further think about it, but to further apply the truth of the message to your everyday life.
[time=513] And I think that's something that's so important. I'm grateful, as you know, that you tune in each week,
[time=519] thankful that you can hear the message. But what is so important, James says in the book of James,
[time=525] is that you're not just a hearer of the word, but a doer of the word.
[time=529] And sometimes the opportunity to further think it through.
[time=533] Sometimes the opportunity for you and I to further wrestle with and write out some things
[time=539] and really consider how this truth applies to the everyday of my life.
[time=543] Sometimes it's very helpful. So I hope you'll come to the website and click on the digging deeper icon there and really be blessed and encouraged and challenged
[time=552] as you continue to apply the truth from the message on Sunday to the everyday life of your week Monday through Friday.
[time=560] Hey, thanks so much for tuning in today. Thank you for being a part of the Blackhawk family.
[time=565] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=576] [MUSIC - 47 seconds]
[time=638] [APPLAUSE]
[time=645] Hey, I got to just say up front, if I seem a little amped up this morning, I want you to know that back in the back there, they've got every kind of breakfast roll and sugar cookie and Easter delectable that you can imagine.
[time=658] And if that's not bad enough, I've been off sweets for six weeks and this morning, let's just say I've partakened.
[time=665] I'm about to go into a sugar coma, it feels like.
[time=668] So if I collapse, don't worry, I've just died of sugar intake in the last two hours.
[time=674] It's good to see all of you. I want to just say to you as we start out that if ever there was a day, you know, on any given Sunday, you know,
[time=685] I stand here and do my best to share with you what I, what we believe to be true.
[time=690] If ever there was a day, you know, when all of us should feel the freedom to proclaim as you just have so well, what we believe today would be that day, amen?
[time=701] And I want to just tell you, there are so many great truths connected to this great day.
[time=707] There are so many great truths that are connected to Easter, to Resurrection Sunday.
[time=713] The first couple that come to mind, one would be this, one great truth connected to Resurrection Sunday is the fact that what took place on that morning there at that tomb, Jesus defeating death, the empty tomb,
[time=727] that event kind of triggers, if you will, it births passion and courage
[time=733] into a small band of men and women.
[time=737] We don't know exactly how many of them there were, maybe a couple hundred at the most, who were faithful followers of Jesus, who in the recent days had seen their dreams, they thought come to an end. They couldn't believe what they had witnessed.
[time=750] They were so amazed by what had transpired. He had been caught.
[time=754] He had been tried. He had been murdered. He had been buried in this tomb.
[time=758] And all that they had lived for, and all that they had given themselves to, surely in their hearts and minds to a large degree on the line.
[time=766] Now he defeats death. Now the tomb is empty.
[time=768] Now what he said he would do, he did, and they are absolutely from that day forward
[time=775] filled with the courage and the hope and the excitement and the vision
[time=782] that Christ instilled in them. And they went and did what he called them to do, and we're here today because of that. Do you understand this?
[time=791] It's a great, great truth, connected to Resurrection Sunday.
[time=795] Another one that comes to mind is the fact that the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the factual, historical resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[time=807] sets biblical Christianity, and I say it that way just to try and be as specific as I can.
[time=814] It sets biblical Christianity apart from all other faiths.
[time=819] It sets biblical Christianity apart from all other movements or religions.
[time=824] No other religious leader, no other leader of a movement.
[time=828] Confucius didn't say, and Muhammad didn't say, and Joseph Smith didn't say, "Nobody said I'm going to defeat death.
[time=835] I'm going to be killed and put in a tomb and rise again in three days." Nobody said it, but who? Jesus. And who did it? Jesus.
[time=844] And it sets this great and glorious faith of ours apart in a special and unique way.
[time=851] But I believe this morning, and I want to focus our attention on this, I believe this morning that maybe the greatest, most compelling truth about Easter.
[time=860] For every one of us in this room this morning is that the resurrection of Jesus is the difference for you and I between life and death.
[time=870] Let me say it this way, the resurrection, and what you choose to do with it today
[time=877] is the difference between eternal living and eternal dying.
[time=883] Scripture teaches us that arisen Jesus who defeats death and walks out of that tomb, guarantees, guarantees to those that follow him, what we'll call this morning, real living, real life.
[time=898] What do we mean by real life? What we mean by real life?
[time=901] What we mean by real living is meaningful life today filled with purpose and hope followed by eternal life someday with God in heaven.
[time=910] Scripture teaches us that arisen Jesus who defeats death and walks out of that tomb, guarantees that kind of living for those that know and love and follow him, real life.
[time=923] Romans 6, 3 to 4 says, or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized
[time=930] into Christ Jesus, those who have fully surrendered their hearts and lives to him,
[time=936] have been baptized into his death.
[time=939] Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too, because we were with him, so we too might walk in newness of what?
[time=955] There's that word, life, real living, meaningful life today filled with purpose
[time=963] and hope followed by eternal life someday with God in heaven.
[time=967] And it was that life, my friends.
[time=970] And it was that life that Jesus invited people to again and again and again, a forgiven life, a peaceful life, a resurrected life, if you will,
[time=982] a life that counts for something.
[time=986] Who in here doesn't want that?
[time=989] Who doesn't want a life that's forgiven, a life filled with peace, a life resurrected, a life that counts for something?
[time=996] It's a life that is full, it's a life that is found only in relationship with Jesus Christ, and it's a life that when it's all said and done,
[time=1006] interesting here, a life that's when it's all said and done only a few,
[time=1013] only a few Scripture says, only a few will find.
[time=1023] Did you know that?
[time=1026] It's sad in a way, but it's also very, very true.
[time=1032] Jesus said it Himself.
[time=1034] In Matthew 7, in a brief little gospel passage about a narrow gate and a wide one.
[time=1041] And would you in honor of God's word, would you stand?
[time=1045] Let me read this for us this morning, Matthew 7, verses 13 and 14.
[time=1053] Jesus here speaking says, "Enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide,
[time=1061] and the way is broad that leads to destruction.
[time=1066] And there are many who enter through it.
[time=1071] For the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to what?
[time=1077] Say it.
[time=1078] There's that word again.
[time=1080] The very thing that we celebrate this morning.
[time=1082] The very thing made possible by our Lord this morning.
[time=1086] For the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.
[time=1094] Two gates.
[time=1097] We got two on the stage here this morning, just for you to look at and think it through as we make our way through the passage.
[time=1105] A wide gate.
[time=1107] Even attractive, right?
[time=1111] I might say.
[time=1113] A wide gate that Jesus says many will choose.
[time=1117] A wide gate Jesus says leads to death and destruction.
[time=1122] And a narrow gate, pretty simple, pretty plain.
[time=1126] A narrow gate that leads to life, and only a few, he says, will find it.
[time=1134] Let's pray.
[time=1137] Father in Heaven as we come this morning to this great resurrection truth.
[time=1142] Oh God as we come to these words that strike deep into our hearts and minds.
[time=1148] God words that paint so very clear a picture of the gospel and the hope that is found in you and the choice God that you've given man.
[time=1157] I pray God this morning that you would give each and every one of us in this room what would be needed to not just hear but respond.
[time=1164] God to this life-giving truth.
[time=1167] God that you would give us great humility.
[time=1169] God that our hearts and minds would be filled with a willingness to hear what is true.
[time=1175] And God that we would not only hear it but be willing to act upon it.
[time=1179] The implications as we've already said this morning of the resurrection are huge.
[time=1186] And God as we discover some of those implications this morning.
[time=1190] As we think them through and apply them to our lives, God may we do so with great wisdom in your son's name we pray.
[time=1198] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1200] Real quick I want to make three general observations this morning if I can about this passage.
[time=1205] And in the process share a couple of principles with each and every one of you that could change literally change your life forever.
[time=1213] I mean it.
[time=1214] I can't wait to get to it.
[time=1215] Here we go.
[time=1216] Observation number one as we look and read through this short little passage.
[time=1221] There are just two gates.
[time=1224] I want you to write that down on the note page there in your bulletin or maybe you've brought your own paper but just write that down.
[time=1230] There are just two gates.
[time=1233] Two gates that lead to two subsequent ways or roads the text says.
[time=1238] We didn't have quite enough room in here to have Beth and her team build the roads.
[time=1243] So you're going to have to just imagine the roads, two gates with two subsequent ways or roads.
[time=1250] And what is clearly stated here in the text is that we enter you and I.
[time=1254] We choose in our own spiritual journeys one or the other.
[time=1259] And what I want you to see I know it's pretty obvious but I want you just to kind of scan the stage if you will
[time=1266] and scan the passage if you'd like.
[time=1269] There is no third gate.
[time=1274] There's just two.
[time=1277] In a world filled with multiple philosophies and options for everything Jesus narrows it all down for us to just to.
[time=1289] And I want you to know this.
[time=1290] I want you to be reminded of this this morning you may already know this about Jesus.
[time=1294] If you didn't know this about Jesus I want you to learn this today and see it all through the Gospels.
[time=1301] Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and then even on through the epistles as we have the apostles kind of passing on what Jesus himself invested in them.
[time=1311] We see it consistently through Scripture.
[time=1314] Jesus invites people to follow him.
[time=1319] And before we go on from that I wanted to say this about Jesus inviting people to follow him.
[time=1324] Please understand this morning my friends that that's what he did.
[time=1327] He invited people to, he didn't invite people to a building.
[time=1332] He didn't invite people to a denomination.
[time=1335] He didn't invite people to a code to a list of do's and don'ts.
[time=1340] He didn't invite people to rules.
[time=1343] Jesus invited people to follow him period.
[time=1349] Do what he did, value what he valued, serve the way he served, live like he lived.
[time=1357] All through the Gospels as Jesus invites people to follow him he makes them by virtue of the way he invites them he makes them choose.
[time=1367] Does it all the time?
[time=1369] He is an encounter after encounter with people in his invitation to them to follow him.
[time=1376] He's always making them choose and he's always watch this.
[time=1380] He's always making the choice very simple.
[time=1385] He's not complicated.
[time=1387] It doesn't get crazy and filled with options.
[time=1391] No, he invites them to follow him.
[time=1393] He's always making them choose and he makes the choice very, very simple.
[time=1396] All through the Gospels you can just make a list.
[time=1399] There's a small gate or a white gate.
[time=1402] No third what?
[time=1404] There's a narrow road and a broad road.
[time=1407] No third what?
[time=1408] None.
[time=1409] There's a good tree.
[time=1410] Jesus talks about all through the Gospels.
[time=1412] There's this illustration he gives of a good tree and a bad tree and he never talks about a third what?
[time=1417] No third tree.
[time=1419] There's houses that are built on sand and there are houses that are built on
[time=1425] and no third house.
[time=1428] None.
[time=1429] True disciples and false disciples and never is there any third category of disciples.
[time=1435] He always makes you choose and he always allows the choice to be very simple.
[time=1442] Just two gates.
[time=1444] Second observation.
[time=1446] The gates lead to there's two gates and the gates lead to two drastically different destinations.
[time=1453] One gate the narrow gate leads to life.
[time=1456] Eternal never ending living with God in heaven.
[time=1461] The other gate the broad gate leads to the text says destruction which is synonymous for death.
[time=1467] Eternal never ending dying being apart from God separated from him forever.
[time=1473] Just two gates with the two gates leading to just two drastically different destinations life or death.
[time=1483] Now stop right here because I can feel it kind of in the room first hour.
[time=1489] I can sort of feel it in the room second hour.
[time=1493] Might be the sugar could be the spirit.
[time=1497] I think it's the spirit.
[time=1500] I can sense in the room and maybe it's because I've had so many of these conversations and hear me.
[time=1506] This is a good conversation.
[time=1508] I don't mind the conversation but there are some sitting in here right now who as I share that with you
[time=1516] maybe one of the thoughts that crosses your mind or maybe this morning it's the dominant thought in your mind.
[time=1521] Maybe you're thinking how arrogant.
[time=1525] How narrow. How rigid of Jesus to say that or maybe you're just thinking how narrow and rigid and unloving of me to say it.
[time=1539] And I've had people say that to me.
[time=1542] You know good people with good minds who try to think this through.
[time=1545] And they say you know what I just think that's the most unloving thing in the world.
[time=1549] For him to say that there's just one way.
[time=1554] And if you're feeling that today, if you're thinking that through I want to just respectfully maybe just engage you for a moment here.
[time=1562] And I want to just ask you to honestly think about it.
[time=1564] Is it the most unloving thing one could say?
[time=1569] Or maybe, maybe is it the most loving thing anybody could have ever said?
[time=1580] I'll tell you a story. I've told it before. Many of you in the room have heard me tell the story so bear with me.
[time=1585] I try and just tell it every couple of years or so. It's a great, just great example of this very thing.
[time=1591] I was 21-22.
[time=1594] Living in Los Angeles had just come to faith in Christ and one of the very first things that I got to do as a young believer is I got to join in with an incredible group of folks who helped at our church with junior high kids.
[time=1606] I got involved as a volunteer staff person with junior high kids and one of my first responsibilities was to lead and come alongside a small group of seventh grade boys.
[time=1615] It was an absolutely life-changing experience. I can remember all of their names to this day.
[time=1621] It impacted and transformed me probably more than it did them but we studied the Bible together.
[time=1627] We played ball together. We went to the beach together. It was incredible.
[time=1630] One day, two of the guys called me and said, "Hey, come to the lake." They were going up to the lake north of LA to go water skiing and tubing.
[time=1638] Their families were going. Friends of their family were going so it was a great day. I said, "Yes, we go to Lake Pyramid.
[time=1644] We tube and ski and have more fun than should be humanly allowed."
[time=1650] It was just incredible. Nine in the morning to about six at night never stopped skiing and tubing and fighting out in the water and yelling and screaming and eating on the shore.
[time=1661] It was awesome. Last run of the day, we were out there just killing each other on these tubes. Me and all these seventh grade boys and one of the dads and moms was in the boat.
[time=1671] We get down. We bring the tubes in. We hop in. We drive them back to the shore. The dad stops the boat. I have no idea exactly how far it was. It looked like it was about a mile.
[time=1681] It was probably several, maybe a couple of two, three hundred yards. He stops the boat and says, "Hey, you guys want to swim in?"
[time=1687] Well, all of these seventh grade boys are like, "Yeah, that sounds like fun. I'm still trying to catch my breath from the tube wars."
[time=1693] I say no. They call me names. I shouldn't say here in public. I give in and we swim to shore and the boat takes off around the bend and we're swimming to shore.
[time=1704] It was a long way and I was really tired and it wasn't going well. They're 30 yards ahead of me. I'm really struggling.
[time=1712] Finally, I just decided to let my pride go. I wasn't going to beat him. I'm just trying to at this point live. I'm getting to the point just to where I can tell him about the touch ground.
[time=1723] I'm almost home. I don't know why, but I look back. I had no reason to look back, but I look back. On my last breath, almost, I look back and unbeknownst to me, one of the boys' moms had decided the gal who was in the boat.
[time=1741] As the dad started to take off, she said, "Wait, I want to swim in." She had jumped in and she wasn't doing so well. She was tired and she wasn't going to make it and I look back only to see her going under.
[time=1756] The boat's gone and everybody else on shore isn't paying attention. I don't know what to do other than just to turn around and swim back as best I could.
[time=1766] At this point now, I'm literally scared to death because I'm not making it. I'm barely above water and I make my way out to Glenda Houghton.
[time=1778] Glenda Houghton, one of the nicest, sweetest, kindest, late 40, early 50, not sure. Just a really, really nice lady.
[time=1791] Just one of those really pristine, almost like a doll. I mean, she was just so kind and she's dying. She's drowning.
[time=1800] She can't stay up and I make my way to her and as soon as I get to her out in the water, maybe some of you experienced this, I don't know.
[time=1808] But as soon as I got to her and she saw me, it was as if she was possessed and she starts scratching my face, pushing my head down.
[time=1818] She's got her leg wrapped around my chest and she's hitting and she's scratching and she's screaming right in my ear. She's completely lost and we're both drowning now. She's killing me.
[time=1829] And now I don't know what to do because she's so panicked and she's so out of control and she's scratching and she's clawing and she's hitting and she's screaming.
[time=1837] So I don't know what to do. It's Glinda Hutton, but I just slapped her. I just hauled off and slapped her across her face and I yelled and couldn't believe it was Glinda Hutton.
[time=1849] I yelled at Glinda Hutton. I said, "Shut up!" I slapped her across the head. I yelled at her to shut up. Kids don't say that at home.
[time=1860] And then I grabbed her by her ears like she was a dog. And I said, "Listen to me." And I just told her, "Get on my back." It's all I could think to do.
[time=1870] And by the time I hit her and grabbed her ears and yelled at her, she kind of broke out of it, spitting water out of her mouth and she just gets on my back and we swim.
[time=1882] And I don't know how it worked, but we just, we made it. And I want you to understand that I didn't swim up to Glinda and say, "Hey Glinda, I got some options for you."
[time=1901] Glinda, I got a multiple choice here thing I want you to think through with me for a moment. "Hey, oh, get back up out of the water. I'm not done giving you your options."
[time=1912] You with me? There was one way that we were going to live. There was one way that she wasn't going to die.
[time=1925] And as narrow or as rigid as that may seem to some, it was the way that led to what? Life. I think.
[time=1938] Now, I knew that. I wasn't all knowing, but I had a view of that circumstance that she didn't in her state and I knew what was at stake and I gave her the most loving option.
[time=1953] God knows, Jesus knows very well what's at stake, more so than you and I.
[time=1959] He sees what's on the line and here he, I believe, not arrogantly or rigidly, but lovingly extends to you and I this life vest that leads to life.
[time=1974] There's just two gates. Number two, the two gates lead to two drastically different destinations.
[time=1981] Observation number three, contrary to the way some people explain and view this passage, observation number three, the choice isn't between the evil gate and the good gate.
[time=1993] That's right. We oftentimes get sidetracked in our interpretation of this statement by Jesus.
[time=1999] We start thinking wide gate and destruction and we assume that Jesus means that the wide gate is the worldly gate, that the wide gate is the immoral gate, that the wide gate is the evil and sinful gate.
[time=2014] And that the narrow gate is the squeaky clean, got it all together, gate.
[time=2020] Well, listen, what you have to always keep in mind, and we've tried to teach you this over the years, what you have to always keep in mind whenever you're interpreting or studying the Bible, is that you have to see everything and interpret everything in its proper context.
[time=2040] And the context, what's going on right there, what's happening in that passage, what's going on in that chapter, what's the flow of that book.
[time=2055] See, you always understand scripts, you don't pull stuff out and make independent observations, no, you always interpret according to the context.
[time=2066] So, what are these two gates? Let's go to the context.
[time=2071] This two verse statement by Jesus about gates comes at the end of what's known as the Sermon on the what?
[time=2079] Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5, 6, and 7.
[time=2084] Jesus takes his place on the top of the Mount of Olives.
[time=2089] His 12 disciples settle in at his feet to listen as he lays out one of the most comprehensive, one of the most basic and clear treatments of the Christian faith.
[time=2100] Christian faith ever communicated, and he and his 12 disciples are joined by about, oh, 15 to 20,000 people.
[time=2111] Scholars and historians would say 15 to 20,000 down that north slope of the Mount of Olives, in through the valley and up on the face of the adjoining mountain.
[time=2123] Most of them, here you go, most of them devoted Jewish people who hear about a new rabbi on the scene and come to listen because they're good Jews, and that's what good Jews do.
[time=2134] They listen to good rabbis. The crowd that day wasn't the overtly wicked or evil crowd.
[time=2141] These were the religious people. These, my friends, were the faithful, the devoted Jews for the most part, who thought a lot of rabbis and their teachings.
[time=2151] And they actually, on this day, ended up thinking a lot of Jesus.
[time=2159] Do you know that? They applauded him. They were amazed by him. They didn't hate him. They admired him.
[time=2169] How do I know? Well, look in your Bibles. Look at Matthew 7, 28 and 29 right there at the end, at the end of the sermon on the Mount.
[time=2179] Have you ever read what it says? When Jesus, verse 28, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were what?
[time=2188] They were amazed. The crowds were beside themselves. The crowds were blown away. They couldn't believe what they had heard.
[time=2199] It had moved them. It had stirred them. It says the crowds were amazed at his teaching, and that's not all. Look at 29, for he was, by their estimation, for he was teaching them as one having authority and not as their scribes.
[time=2216] He was special, and they were blown away. But here's what I want you to see.
[time=2225] They thought the Jews, and we've talked about this. They thought they'd gone through the right gate.
[time=2237] They thought their commitment to religion had him on the right road. Think about this. They believed he existed.
[time=2250] Tell you what, raise your hand if you believe he exists. Everybody, raise your hand if you believe he exists. All right, roomful.
[time=2260] They respected his teachings. They couldn't believe what they had heard. He gets done in their life. Wow, that is awesome. They were amazed.
[time=2272] That guy's incredible, and he's better than our scribes. They believed he existed. They respected his teachings. Raise your hand if you respect his teachings.
[time=2285] You hear his teachings, and you think, those are good teachings. All right, roomful. Again. And they knew they could tell. They could tell him the valley that day.
[time=2294] They could tell on that mountain side that he was special. He was something unique. Raise your hand if you think he's something special, unique. Yeah, roomful.
[time=2304] Well, are you okay? Thank you for responding. And I could ask some more questions that might begin to kind of then separate a few of us out on some certain things.
[time=2315] But I want you to know, right there, those three questions, the way you all responded, you're right there with all of them that day. They all believe that.
[time=2323] They all saw it. They admired him. They admired him.
[time=2336] But this morning, my friends, here's what you've got to realize. You've got to realize this. There is a huge difference between admiring him and following him.
[time=2351] An enormous difference between admiring him and following him. My friends, in that sermon, that day, and in the days that followed.
[time=2362] And you know what? I'm not an expert on this thing. I've been studying it, and I've been reading it, and I've been trying to teach it best I can for years.
[time=2370] I don't know everything about it, but I can tell you this unequivocally. I can tell you this without hesitation.
[time=2378] He never once asked a single person to admire him.
[time=2386] But he asked them again and again and again, and he continues to ask today, again and again and again for them to follow him.
[time=2398] So really, so really this wide gate, according to the context, and I think it's helpful, this wide gate can really be called the "I admire Jesus" gate.
[time=2411] I'm a pretty good person gate. I'm trying to do pretty good things. I even come to church periodically.
[time=2419] I mean, I pay my taxes and I don't cheat on my spouse and I'm pretty good to my family. I drive a Chevy, you know.
[time=2429] I buy American. I mean, there's all kinds of things that folks want to add to this picture of their goodness.
[time=2437] And Jesus, he exists absolutely. I respect his teachings, yeah.
[time=2443] And I think he's really special. See, this could be the "I admire Jesus" gate.
[time=2449] And there's one last thing though you have to add to that caricature of that person there.
[time=2455] Believe he exists, yes, respect his teachings, yes, think he's special, yes. Good person trying to do good things, yes.
[time=2463] But, oh, yeah, I'm in control of my life. I'm calling the shots. I got this thing mapped out.
[time=2477] I'm the one punching the buttons. I'm the one pulling the strings. It's my life. And I'm going to live it my way.
[time=2485] On this gate, according to the context here, this gate could be called the "I want to follow Jesus" gate.
[time=2491] This gate could be the "I'm a sinful person." I know that now.
[time=2496] My sin has separated me from God. I'm a sinful person whose best efforts fall short.
[time=2502] And I, oh, yeah. And I completely relinquish all control of my life to him.
[time=2508] I'd rather have him lead. I'd rather have him guide. I'd rather follow honor and obey him.
[time=2516] And there is such, as you think that through, and as you begin to consider and contemplate that, my friends,
[time=2524] there is such a difference between admiring and following.
[time=2528] I read several things over the last couple of weeks. One author I read talked about Martin Luther King.
[time=2534] Martin Luther King, Jr. and the hundreds of thousands of people who admired his stand,
[time=2542] who admired what he was about, who admired his willingness to stand up for those who didn't have any rights.
[time=2549] There were hundreds of thousands of people who were so inspired by him and they admired his willingness
[time=2556] to stand up for a people who wouldn't have stood up without him.
[time=2562] But how many people had their homes bombed?
[time=2566] How many people went to jail with him? How many people were felled by an assassin's bullet? Not many.
[time=2576] Because there's a huge difference between admiring someone and what? Following.
[time=2582] I think about Mother Teresa. I think about the things I've read about her and the stuff that we've learned for years and years
[time=2588] while in Europe, hundreds of thousands of people began to be drawn to her writings to stand that she took to care for those who were in need, to come alongside those in abject poverty.
[time=2600] The way in which she attempted to live out her faith was one that inspired and garnered the admiration of many.
[time=2610] But who moved to Calcutta with her?
[time=2615] Who went with her to live in the absolute pit of despair?
[time=2620] Who went with Mother Teresa?
[time=2623] She went to care for those dying of disease, barefoot, living day after day, night after night
[time=2630] in the midst of absolute humiliation and poverty and sickness. Not many.
[time=2637] Oh, she was admired. But few followed because there's a huge difference between admiring and following.
[time=2643] I watched Tiger Woods last week. I love watching Tiger Woods. I'm sorry.
[time=2648] I watched him last week again do what he has done so many times, 70 second whole.
[time=2654] You saw it coming. Needs a birdie to win. The sun's going down. The crowd's around the green.
[time=2660] He's back from a knee surgery. Could he do it? Can he pull it off?
[time=2664] Lines up a 16 foot putt and drops it in the center of the cup.
[time=2668] Come on, tell me, how can you not love golf?
[time=2673] Doesn't that just get you going?
[time=2677] It's the sugar, isn't it? I know, I'm sorry.
[time=2681] It was amazing. We yelled at scream like we've been doing now for years with him, but I'll tell you what I didn't do.
[time=2688] The next day I didn't go to the bank, an empty, cabernized bank account, hire a swing coach and join a country club.
[time=2696] I don't know that the account could have gotten me those things, but it's nice to say it.
[time=2702] I didn't do that. I admire him, but I'm not what? I'm not following him.
[time=2708] What does all that mean? Here you go. I put it on the screen for you.
[time=2711] You see, following, oh, please don't miss this this morning, following requires full devotion and complete commitment.
[time=2720] My life agenda gets abandoned for the sake of the cause, and instead I make the cause of Christ my life agenda.
[time=2730] My values change. My priorities change. My willingness to humbly serve now trumps my prideful demand to be served.
[time=2739] My obsession with getting is now replaced by a passion to give. I'm gracious, not greedy, compassionate instead of cruel.
[time=2747] God honoring, not self-serving. Why? Because that's how Jesus lived, and now I'm following who?
[time=2756] Jesus. Part of a religion? No. Part of a denomination? No. A keeper of rules? No.
[time=2765] Following Jesus. Back to Matthew 7. Many admired. Few followed. How do I know?
[time=2775] I know because the end of Matthew 7 comes. He walks off the mountain. 20,000 people are like, whoa, great job.
[time=2788] Hey, you keep at it. You're good stuff. That guy was amazing. Now what do you want to go do? 20,000 were amazed.
[time=2797] How many followed? 12. There's a gate that leads to destruction, and many find it.
[time=2813] And there's a gate and a road that leads to life. And only if you find it. 12 followed him off that mountain.
[time=2823] 12, imagine. We've talked about this before. Imagine being one of those 12. Imagine being one of those young guys who had finally found what they were looking for.
[time=2836] Imagine them saying, are you kidding me? I've been waiting my whole life to give myself to something like this, to someone like him.
[time=2846] I don't know if they had chips back then, but all my chips are in. Someone who frees me from my greed and fears, are you kidding me?
[time=2854] My addictions, my sexual sin, my junk, and all my guilt, I'm in. Someone who frees me up and empowers me to help him. Redeem a broken world, I'm in.
[time=2864] I'm completely in. You mean I get to have confidence beyond the grave? And no longer, if you're death, I'm in.
[time=2870] I'm following him off this mountain to wherever he leads me. I'll do more than admire. I'll follow.
[time=2878] I choose this gate, they said. I'll choose this gate.
[time=2887] And perhaps today this is your choice. Perhaps today you would say, you know what? Wow. This is pretty big. And this is pretty clear.
[time=2903] And I need to choose. And he lovingly, not arrogantly, has given me a choice. And maybe today you would say, give me Jesus.
[time=2916] Someone asked Corbin and John if they'd come. And I'd like every one of you in the room to just take a moment. Would you just bow your heads right where you're at?
[time=2924] I'll give you a chance to look up here in a moment and you can kind of follow along with Jonathan. But right now, bow your heads.
[time=2932] And close your eyes and let me just invite you. We've got some time left here. The ham's not going to burn.
[time=2939] The kids are being well cared for. And I really want you to think this morning about what we've been looking at here.
[time=2949] I hope by this point you sense the love that our Lord had in his heart. I hope you sense the love that we have in ours for you.
[time=2959] There really are just two gates and all of life really comes down to this. Which one will you choose?
[time=2966] And I want to invite you this morning to with great humility and with great honesty before him. I know many of you, there's some of you in the room this morning, I don't know.
[time=2978] I don't know where you're at on your journey with him. I don't know what's kept you in the past from bowing the knee of your heart and fully surrendering.
[time=2988] Fully giving, fully devoting yourself not to a religion or a building or a list of do's and don'ts but to a life of relationship with him.
[time=3000] And so as Jonathan sings, I want to just invite you to sincerely give thought to where God may be calling you this morning. Let's listen.
[time=3018] In the morning when I rise.
[time=3045] Give me Jesus.
[time=3071] You can have all this world but give me Jesus.
[time=3088] And when I am alone.
[time=3106] Give me Jesus.
[time=3129] You can have all this world but give me Jesus.
[time=3151] And when I come to die.
[time=3189] Give me Jesus.
[time=3212] You can have all this world.
[time=3237] Give me Jesus.
[time=3267] Well, if your head's bowed and your eyes closed, let me just say this to you before we go this morning.
[time=3273] There's two gates. One leads to life and we want to invite you to that this morning.
[time=3280] And not only invite you to it but we're a family here you see that once nothing more really than to help those who have walked through that gate, learn and know what it means to follow him on that road.
[time=3292] And so we commit this morning to do that very thing.
[time=3296] And a second I'm going to just have you stand and we're going to pray and I'm going to dismiss you.
[time=3301] I hope if you've brought your Easter alms offering you'll drop it off on the way out.
[time=3306] I hope if you've got loose change you'll do that as well to help our trips and our people get where they're going this summer.
[time=3313] But here's what we're going to do.
[time=3314] I'm going to ask you to leave quietly and anybody in the room.
[time=3318] Anybody who wants to just stay and make their way to the front will just meet you here and we'll talk for a moment and then we're just going to open that gate and just let you walk through it.
[time=3330] There's a symbolic gesture on your part if you're either your first time commitment.
[time=3337] Maybe this is the first time you've finally just said I'm going to give myself completely to the one who died for me to live a life that he designed for me to live.
[time=3348] So you can come and do that.
[time=3350] You know what, there may be some of you in the room this morning and you at some point in time you've made a commitment to the Lord.
[time=3356] You've fully surrendered your heart and life but for whatever reason.
[time=3360] And I know there are many.
[time=3362] You find yourself today living a life that would be more consistent with this road over here.
[time=3369] You got a narrow gate profession of faith and kind of a broad road lifestyle and you know in your heart this morning that that's not how he designed it and you want nothing more today than to come back and say wait a minute.
[time=3383] I need some help and I need some encouragement.
[time=3386] I want to re-walk through that narrow gate and ask for help to walk that road God's called me to walk.
[time=3392] Any of you will stay here as long as we need to.
[time=3396] It's okay.
[time=3397] You come when we dismiss and you can walk through that gate.
[time=3401] Would you stand with me?
[time=3404] Father God as we leave this morning we leave with the clear sense that you have been with us God.
[time=3410] You have and your spirit has resided over this time.
[time=3415] God we sense the power of your truth.
[time=3418] We've been encouraged God and reminded by the sweet fragrance of our worship.
[time=3425] God we've been amazed all over again at how penetrating and how convicting and how encouraging the word of God is.
[time=3435] And for all of it God we're grateful.
[time=3438] When an amazing morning of celebration and we leave today thankful for a son that you were willing to part with.
[time=3444] You're only begotten son who you loved.
[time=3448] But God your love for us allowed you to turn on him even for that brief moment so that sin could be forgiven so that hope could be restored.
[time=3458] And God today we've thanked you as best we can and we'll look forward to doing that again.
[time=3464] With us as we go God encourage, give courage to those who need to come and walk through this gate and may it be a sweet time for them today.
[time=3476] This is day of all days, this Resurrection Sunday.
[time=3480] We love you and we thank you God.
[time=3482] Be with us as we go in your son's name we pray. Amen.
