[time=30] Well, hello, everybody.
[time=34] Welcome to the broadcast today.
[time=35] We're so grateful to have you with us.
[time=37] And I am so thankful.
[time=39] We are so thankful here at Blackhawk for the amazing Easter Resurrection weekend that we were able to experience this past week.
[time=49] As you watch the broadcast today, you'll see our Sunday morning follow-up to Easter, kind of our Easter message part two.
[time=57] And I want to just encourage you this morning, as you watch the message to be thinking about how this applies to you.
[time=64] If you've been watching, you know that on Easter Sunday, we had the privilege of turning to this small little passage in Matthew seven, where Jesus talked about two gates, the narrow gate and the wide gate.
[time=76] And it is this narrow gate, Jesus says, that leads to life.
[time=80] The very life made possible by the resurrection.
[time=83] And this narrow gate leads to a road, a way, it says in the passage there.
[time=89] And this is the road we've entitled, and I believe the passage in titles following Jesus.
[time=96] This narrow gate and the road that comes after it is all about a life and a heart that is devoted to following Jesus Christ.
[time=105] And this morning, as you watch, what we've done is just kind of expanded on that.
[time=109] We want you to understand and see in a very specific way what following Jesus looks like.
[time=115] It can be kind of a nebulous term.
[time=118] We can just talk about following Jesus.
[time=120] We can talk about honoring the Lord.
[time=122] We can talk about living lives that are Christ like.
[time=126] But what does that really look like?
[time=128] What does it really mean for you and I to live lives today that would be consistent with the way Jesus lived?
[time=137] Modeling our lives after him, valuing what he valued, prioritizing what he prioritized, patterns in our living, a rhythm to life that is consistent with the way he lived life, consistent with the way those that followed him lived their lives.
[time=156] And so we come back again this morning to a phrase that we've used often over the last year here at Black Hawk, that phrase being elemental.
[time=164] There are five elements that we as a leadership here at Black Hawk have identified in our study of the life of Jesus.
[time=172] As we look closely at the Gospels in the book of Acts, we see that Jesus and those that followed after him did some things that were very specific, gave themselves to some very specific disciplines, if you will.
[time=185] And we want you this morning to see those disciplines, to understand better those disciplines.
[time=190] And then lastly, this, we want you to come.
[time=192] We do, we want you to come to Black Hawk and allow us the privilege of putting our arms around you and helping you in smaller settings.
[time=201] We love the larger setting.
[time=203] We love worshiping together.
[time=204] But it is in smaller settings, in small groups and Sunday morning community settings where we're able to pass along those five elements in a way that can be life changing for you.
[time=216] And so I hope you'll come.
[time=217] I hope you'll come and allow us the chance, first of all, of meeting you and then allowing you to get plugged into a community setting where these five elements, these patterns of our Lord, can begin to not only be understood better by you, but lived out by you in the everyday of your life.
[time=233] Hey, thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=235] We're so grateful for the opportunity to walk through life together, so thankful for the relationship God has given us with you.
[time=242] I hope you'll come and take us up on the offer.
[time=246] We'd love nothing more than to help you and the days to come understand what it means to find and follow Christ.

[time=526] - I wanna ask if you would to just open your Bibles
[time=536] back to Matthew chapter seven, and I wanna read the two verses that I read to you last week.
[time=541] And we wanna come back and literally almost just kind of pick up this morning where we left off last week.
[time=548] I don't know if you got my email that I sent out this week.
[time=551] Raise your hands if you're on my email list.
[time=554] All right, well, there's cool.
[time=556] There may be a bunch of you who didn't even know about that.
[time=558] If you go to our website and just click on Kelly's email list, it is just down the right hand side.
[time=565] I think it's just a great way.
[time=566] I just love communicating with everybody all at once.
[time=569] And I sat down, I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday, and I had had several conversations with people regarding last Sunday, and what an amazing Sunday it was.
[time=581] What a great weekend we had with Good Friday and Resurrection Sunday.
[time=585] And I think it was the fourth or fifth conversation I had with people who, with good intentions, it wasn't like they had bad attitudes at all, but the general gist of the conversation was, man, it stinks that Easter's over.
[time=599] You know, that was really fun.
[time=601] And now it was kind of like, I guess now you just kind of gotta go back to the normal Sunday gig, huh?
[time=606] And I started thinking about it, and I just wrote this out and I sent it to all of you on the list.
[time=610] One week removed from Easter, I believe the tomb is still empty and that our risen Jesus is still alive.
[time=617] I believe this Sunday brings with it just as much promise and hope as last, just as much reason to celebrate and give thanks.
[time=627] I believe the narrow gate still leads to real life and eternal living and that the wide gate doesn't.
[time=634] I believe that the power of the resurrection is still in the air and that hurting, searching souls can be transformed and changed forever today, just like they were last Sunday.
[time=648] One week removed from Easter, I cringe at the thought of waiting another a whole year to sing like that, to gather, to gather and encourage each other with that heightened spirit of anticipation and joy.
[time=662] So why stop?
[time=666] Why would we quit?
[time=669] I serve a risen savior who's in the world today as much as he was last week, amen?
[time=676] And I'd rather just keep proclaiming it.
[time=679] So tell the girls to keep their dresses out and help those little guys tie those little ties one more time, bring families together, buy a new ham, don't let the celebration end.
[time=689] He's still alive, sends power, remains dead and our Lord saved the day, that day, this day and every single day to come.
[time=700] And I believe that with all of my heart and I'm so grateful that we get the chance to come together again today, that resurrection spirit is still in the air and we get a chance to come back to the truth of God's word and I can't wait to see what he has for us this morning.
[time=716] Would you look at Matthew 7, 13 and 14, let me read this to you again, would you in honor of God's word, would you stand?
[time=724] And let me read this to you as we begin this morning.
[time=727] Jesus says in Matthew 7, 13, enter,
[time=733] enter through the narrow gate.
[time=736] Let me stop right there just real quick.
[time=738] Somebody brought this up in between services and I wanna just say this to every one of you.
[time=743] It wasn't but maybe three weeks ago that I stood here and did my very best to teach you from our study on doctrine from the book of Romans, chapters 9, 10 and 11, within which we talked about the doctrine of election.
[time=758] Do you remember this?
[time=760] And we talked about how God is the author of salvation and how God calls us to himself and how salvation, how the faith that we exercise to even experience salvation is a gift from God.
[time=771] We talked about how God is the one who saves and that redemptive activity and energy comes from him toward you and I, we're called by God and the scriptures teach that God knew before the foundations of the world who he would call.
[time=787] Many of us in the room, not our heads, and we say while we sort of understand that and yet there's questions that that sparks as we think about a salvation that almost as you look at it that way, takes the choice away from us and puts it on him.
[time=804] I've always told you that one of the great things I appreciate about the scriptures and one of the great things I appreciate about our God is that he's hard to figure out.
[time=816] There's some mystery there that the smartest of smartest people in the world have never quite ever truly figured out and if they tell you they have, they're lying and they're wrong.
[time=826] Because now we come to a passage here that we came through last Sunday where he, Jesus himself, clearly talks about a choice that people make and this choice that people make
[time=840] and the exercising of that free will and how that rests or stands in comparison to the elective power of God.
[time=847] I don't know that I understand all that but what I've always told you, family, I've always said it to you from the very beginning.
[time=855] I always default to what I do know and what I know is that this book is amazing and it's clarity and consistency and at points where I don't understand, I think he does and I'll keep inviting you to the things that this invites you to and in Matthew 7, 13 and 14, it talks about a very important choice.
[time=874] So can we read it this morning with that truth in mind?
[time=880] Enter you, enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is broad
[time=890] that leads to what, say it, destruction.
[time=893] Another word for what, death, eternal.
[time=898] And there are many who enter through it for the gate is small and the way beyond it, the road that that small gate leads to is narrow and that's a road that leads to life.
[time=913] Remember that?
[time=914] Life, purposeful, meaningful life today and eternal life someday with God and the way is narrow that leads to life and there are few who find it.
[time=928] Father God, we stand before you this morning humbled by how big you are and how massive your truth
[time=936] is, there are times we don't understand it completely but God we know for certain because of what has been revealed to us in your word, what you have shown us in our relationship with you God, we know that you are a loving God, that you are a wise God and that this offer for salvation, God this offer for life is for those who would be willing to accept it.
[time=961] So Father as we talk this morning, not only about that narrow gate but this road that leads beyond it, we pray that you would give each and every one of us in this room this morning great humility and great clarity, God give us courage whoever we are, wherever we've been, courage to embrace the truth and to not just embrace it and listen to it but God that we would all of us in this room today be willing to respond to it in whatever way you would deem necessary.
[time=991] God thank you for the worship that we've experienced, thank you for the word of God, for the spirit of God that is alive and active in it and God I thank you this morning for the people of God who are gathered in this room.
[time=1004] We love you and we pray God your blessing on this time and all the people agreed and said, "Amen, you can be seated." Well as big a deal as last Sunday was with so many people coming forward to walk through this narrow gate, this Sunday's just as big a deal, if not bigger because today we get to talk about the road, the narrow road that this small gate leads to, this way that leads to life and I've just got to tell you last week was absolutely thrilling to stand here on this stage, both ours and just meet individual after individual, person after person.
[time=1042] I'm telling you, they came, they were young, they were old, they were alone, they were married, they came in groups, several of the 55 or so that came, my friends came to walk through that gate right there for the very, in fact I've been meaning to do this ever since I came in, I just think it's a good visual 'cause the gate's what, it's open, yeah, it's not closed.
[time=1070] Many came to walk through that gate for the very first time
[time=1076] and it was interesting, so many of them as we talked up here and I heard the same thing from so many others who talked with people last Sunday morning, so many of them in so many words at the end of the day said why wouldn't I?
[time=1089] Why wouldn't I choose life?
[time=1092] Why wouldn't I choose meaning?
[time=1094] Why wouldn't I choose hope?
[time=1095] Why wouldn't I choose forgiveness?
[time=1097] They said and then others came to just kind of re-clarify
[time=1104] and re-establish the commitment in their own hearts.
[time=1108] I think I said second hour in fact that some maybe have professed a narrow gate commitment but are living wide gate lifestyles and that seemed to strike a chord with many who came, again young and old and it was so encouraging to watch them, to pray with them and to see them walk through that gate.
[time=1130] It's so important that we help people understand though, as important as the gate is.
[time=1136] It's so important that we help people understand what's on the other side of this choice to follow Jesus.
[time=1143] Last Sunday I said to every single person I had the chance to personally speak with, I said to all of them in so many words make sure you come back and I wasn't recruiting people for our church, I wasn't trying to get numbers, I was understanding and trying my best to communicate to them that as thankful as I was for their willingness to walk through that gate, the scripture says, that passage says there's a road on the other side.
[time=1170] It's not just the gate that leads to life, it says the road leads to life.
[time=1175] And walking that road following Jesus, doing more than admiring him is not a trek for the weary, it's not something we can do alone, it's not something that you and I can tackle in and of ourselves, no I need you and you need me to walk that road and I told every one of them, come back, come back and let us help you understand what it looks like and I want you to hear this word specifically and practically to follow Jesus.
[time=1207] See it's one thing to say, oh I'm so excited, I chose to follow Jesus instead of just admire him.
[time=1216] I was there Sunday and Easter at Blackock, it was great, Kelly did this message from Matthew 7, I chose to follow Jesus.
[time=1223] I mean it's one thing to say, I listened to what the scripture said, I sat there that morning and I chose life over death, those are good things to say.
[time=1233] Anybody in the room this morning here that said that last week, I'm grateful.
[time=1237] It's another thing though to understand the specific everyday implications of that choice.
[time=1245] Does that make sense?
[time=1249] Because there are some and they're helpful and they're needed but you and I have to understand what that means and I believe, I believe this with all my heart, I believe with every part of my being that in the following Jesus discussion, specifics about what that looks like, specifics regarding what that entails, I think it's absolutely and completely vital.
[time=1272] In my mind I oftentimes when I'm trying to illustrate something or just think through something in my own mind I'll often default to sports and I can think of times when I was young, trying to learn I tried to play all kinds of sports, there's only a couple today that I know anything about, there's a lot of sports I know nothing about but I remember being little and not knowing much about anything and I remember there would be coaches that I really connected with and then there were coaches that I didn't and I can remember some of the coaches that I didn't and whether it was soccer or basketball or football or swimming or whatever I was doing that just seemed like there were some coaches who in their effort to get me to do better in that sport out of frustration or irritation when I or my friends weren't doing it well would basically in an essence just say do better.
[time=1326] Come on, do better.
[time=1331] And then there were coaches who in their frustration and irritation was okay, time out, come here.
[time=1339] Sit down, okay listen, here's what I want you to do.
[time=1343] I want you to do this and this and this.
[time=1348] They break it down and it would become very what?
[time=1350] Become very simple and in their coaching and even in their motivating they would be very specific and they helped me and I can stand here today and we can stand here in essence as a church and say to those of you who made decisions and to those of you who have fully surrendered yourselves and to those of you who are kind of in this endeavor with us I can say hey come on, do better.
[time=1375] Hey come on, be a part of Blackhawk.
[time=1378] Give yourself to this great endeavor but if I never tell you, if we never talk about it if we never sit down and say hey specifically and practically here's what this looks like then I think we've done a huge disservice.
[time=1394] I believe most people long to know what it is specifically that they can do to make a contribution to the cause.
[time=1401] I think there's a lot of you out there who benefit from a clear, periodic reminder of what it is I expect from you.
[time=1411] As a family member here at Blackhawk what I hope for each of you and what it is that we as a leadership are praying you'll give yourselves to completely in the days ahead and so this morning I wanna just as we begin to talk about this road that leads beyond this gate I wanna give you kind of a big picture if I can kind of a following Jesus life at Blackhawk following Jesus big picture and for us to do that we need to go back toward the back of your New Testament would you turn with me please to first Peter chapter two.
[time=1444] This is where any discussion I believe after 20 plus years in ministry I would tell you in a heartbeat that any discussion about how this whole thing is to function how it is you and I are to live how it is we're to view our connection to this ministry the ministry of the local church and how this things to play out any discussion about how that is to specifically look and function needs to begin here in first Peter two because it's in first Peter two verse nine that Peter using some Old Testament phraseology I say using Old Testament phraseology as you read first Peter two nine and 10 you realize boy these words they might even be in different italics in your translation they could be in all caps they may be kind of set apart from the normal font in your New Testament there there's a reason for that the verbiage that we're about to read is verbiage that was originally assigned to the Jews this was originally assigned in the Old Testament writings as God looked at his kingdom and his kingdom advancing these were pertinent these were vital these were strategic words that God had assigned to his people the Jews as he hoped they would function function as his ambassadors functioning as his representatives to the nations of the world God's hope originally was that his people would follow him that his people would represent him that his people would faithfully proclaim the great goodness and majesty of their God and that the nations would be reached through the nation of who Israel as you study the Old Testament you realize that didn't go so well you realize as you study the Old Testament that there comes a time toward the end where the unfaithfulness of the Jewish nation leads God to move in a different direction for a time when it comes to his redemptive plan to see those in the world reached and his eyes now in the New Testament era turned toward the church we see the church birthed in Acts chapter two and now to the church and what's the church a building or it's people it's B it's people now to the church to you and I these kinds of phrases these kinds of principles are assigned so having said that first Peter two nine and ten says this but you Peter riding through the church but you church are a chosen race a royal priesthood there's a word I want you to hang on to it's a word and a concept that we introduced to you many of you for the first time two years ago in a series we entitled I'm a priest and we introduced to you then for many of you that was the first time for some of you it was a reminder of this great doctrine of the priesthood of all believers and Peter says but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for God's own possession so that you priests the church may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light for you once were not a people but now you are the people of God you had not received mercy but now you have received mercy go back just probably across the page to first Peter two four at the beginning of chapter two Peter again talks about this idea of the priesthood of all believers and it says there in first Peter two four and coming to him Christ as to a living stone which has been rejected by men but is choice and precious in the side of
[time=1681] God and coming to him you verse five also as living stones are being built up as a spiritual house
[time=1690] for a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[time=1696] acceptable to God through Jesus Christ go to the very back of your New Testament to the book of Revelation it's there in Revelation chapter one that we see this concept and this principle again played out Revelation one five the second part of verse five we could spend 20 minutes this morning 30 minutes my friends going just passage by passage by passage where you would see proclaimed and and revealed to you and I in the church God's design that we would function as priests we'll just stick with these three for this morning for timesake Revelation one five second part of verse five to him who loves us and released us from our sins by his blood and he has made us the church to be a kingdom
[time=1749] everybody say that word priests to his god and father priests to his god and father to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever amen the scriptures teach that when God redeems you the scriptures teach that when you walk through that gate and you give your life to following Jesus the scriptures teach that when your soul is redeemed
[time=1776] that you become by virtue of what God does inside of you as the spirit of God
[time=1782] and dwells you the scriptures teach that you become a spiritual priest
[time=1788] you you become a priest imagine that me we become
[time=1794] priests what does that mean we've given you some definition we've given you some thought on this over the last couple of years priests could you could say it a number of different ways I had him put a few things on the screen for you priests in the role of priest in the Old Testament and now as we're called the priesthood of of all believers in the New Testament the function the job description if you will is extremely consistent take a look here priests one thing they did was they represented god to the people they were god's representatives to the people god's heart and and god's law and god's way and god's character
[time=1839] a priest would represent that to the people and you're to be a priest priests passed along god
[time=1851] passed along god to others they passed along god's heart they passed along god's laws they passed along you had god you had the priest and you had the people and as god wanted to lead the people as god wanted to direct the people god would do that through the priest they passed along god's will they passed along god's way to the people look at that next one they mirrored i love this they mirrored god priests played this role they fulfilled this function where they reflected his attributes to beautiful picture they reflect his attributes on to others the love of god
[time=1893] the attributes of god the love of god and the forgiveness of god and the grace of god and the justice of god just named the attributes the priest
[time=1903] had this unspeakable privilege of mirror mirroring that they reflected that on to the people reflecting on to the nations his love and his grace and his forgiveness priests were in the old testament diagram priests were part definitely part of the israelite family they were part of the kingdom of god in that sense yet they were very very when you read about it it's fascinating the role that they played where they lived their function in the temple
[time=1939] it was a very unique they were part of the family as a whole but their function was very unique
[time=1949] when you and i are in the airport when you and i are downtown walking on the sidewalks when we're anywhere we've talked about this before and you see a a gentleman in a black suit with a little white collar you go whoa it's a priest you see him
[time=1969] i mean they just kind of stand out because they're the only ones that look like that they're unique they're different
[time=1980] and while i'm not speaking to the theological foundations of the guy in the white collar i'm just telling you there's something very good there for you and i to take note of there is a uniqueness
[time=1993] they're different priests are it's a beautiful picture of the entire body of christ working and ministering individually yet collectively think about it the church the whole body doing redemptive transformational works because of the active passionate faithful contribution of every single part every part participating every you might want to remember it this way every member and i don't mean formal membership there i just mean we're we're in this together every member a minister every high school student every single adult every married couple every grandmother and grandfather every single mom or dad everybody who has fully surrendered their heart and life to christ scripturally it's indicated that we are in this together you and i
[time=2047] are priests every member a minister now the church
[time=2054] as a whole hundreds and hundreds of years ago this began and when i say this began i'm referring to the fact that they've completely the church completely botched this whole truth this entire doctrine of the priesthood of
[time=2069] hall believers got completely mishandled by the church hundreds and hundreds of years ago church allowed this insidious dangerous philosophy and practice to settle in a
[time=2083] philosophy called and you see it there on the screen the clergy laity distinction now we won't get into this morning where exactly or specifically this insidious dangerous philosophy came from i'm here to tell you that it came and it infiltrated the church and over the years what transpired was this enormous gap in terms of how the church functioned how it lived and breathed there's this gap between the clergy and the laity we even came up with terms that didn't used to be there biblically we just saw that we're all what priests now all of a sudden there's distinction i'm clergy your laity we can look at this philosophy in a number of different ways in our attempt to just explain it kind of lay it out there for you uh you see it on the screen we'll just kind of go down the list uh what does it mean the clergy laity distinction well here's one way of saying it i'm the paid ministry professional and because i'm the paid ministry professional that kind of makes you the what the consumer
[time=2152] so i'm being paid and staff gets paid and what happens then in the church is that folks come expecting to receive the product now all of a sudden the gospel and the kingdom becomes a retail store where folks come in and try it on and see if they like it and if not they leave i'm the paid ministry professional you're a consumer i'll do the ministry and you come each week sit and watch and you might even want to add on to that because sometimes it does happen critique and i know you laugh and i laugh too but it's really not a laughing matter
[time=2193] because that because that just shows you how deep the insidious philosophy
[time=2199] has been instilled because we really do think we're consumers and we really do think that somehow this is a product and we really begin to think that somehow people want to hear if we like that or not instead of backing up and seeing the bigger picture of the gift that it is and the effort that it represents and the greater purpose not of making people happy but honoring god does it make sense i'll do the ministry and you come each week sit and watch i'll give you take pastors here's one way of saying it pastors serve and the congregation gets served we even call them congregations i don't know where that came from Steve you know where that came from
[time=2250] congregations i'm reading here and we're called priests
[time=2256] but now we call ourselves all kinds of things and what happens in this clergy lady distinction is that the congregation can begin to if we're not careful have this idea that they exist to be served this is a great one if you need to if you need to do or want to do
[time=2277] this is the thinking of the clergy lady model if you need to do or want to do more ministry or reach more people what do you do do you build up more priests or do you hire more staff
[time=2290] well they just hire more staff hire more pastors pay more people to do more ministry and we love it because we love more ministry but we miss the foundational truth of turning your bibles to Ephesians 4 we miss this foundational truth Galatians Ephesians Philippians right there in between Galatians and Philippians go to Ephesians 4 all of those examples i just gave you completely miss God's original design
[time=2326] given to us in Ephesians 4 says in Ephesians 4 11 here's here's God giving Paul the blueprint this is how God wanted the church to function this is God's perfect design and he gave verse 11 some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers he gave those individuals to the church and he gave them to the church his bride for what for the equipping for the teaching for the building up for the preparing
[time=2364] of the saints for here it is for the work of service
[time=2371] a work of service to build up the body of Christ who builds up the body of Christ who does the ministry of the body of Christ
[time=2382] who's responsible for the service that the body of Christ offers pastor or priest we're all priests but in this case i'm talking about you the body you the participants you the ones who receive the equipping God says the entire thing is on you that the entire ministry how effective we are how far we reach
[time=2411] all of it dependent on you and that right there dependent upon
[time=2417] those of us who are called to teach those of us who are called to lead doing our very best to equip builds you up we're supposed to be by God's design in this thing completely together side by side we're the same me using my gift me using my gift leadership using its gift so that you'll do so that you'll own so that you'll carry out the ministry of the holy spirit the priest hood of all believers you're a priest then we said this so then we asked
[time=2451] ourselves okay who was the greatest priest of all time
[time=2457] who who was the best priest ever to ever walk the face of the earth
[time=2464] who was the high priest who represented God to others better than anybody's ever represented God to others answer say it out loud Jesus that was the answer we came to so we thought it would be a really good
[time=2480] idea about a year and a half two years ago to study and take a very close look at the gospels in the book of acts so that we could see for ourselves how the great high priest lived what he valued what Jesus prioritized what disciplines did he engage in what did he say no to what did he say yes to and we also looked at that very first church in the book of acts we found that that very first church in the book of acts those individuals who were most recently connected to Jesus they followed him in the very same ways the patterns and the disciplines and the routines we found in the life of Jesus were mirrored by these first century church starters who birthed this amazing endeavor called the local church
[time=2529] and as we looked at the patterns in Jesus life as we looked at the patterns in the life and ministry of that first church we landed on five very important five very strategic five very of God
[time=2542] we felt like in our effort as a leadership we begged God to reveal to us those things that he would want us to call you to to invite you to engage in to invite you to practice we said to God oh god we want nothing more than to build disciples we said this we prayed this to God we want we don't want to build attenders we don't want to build church goers we want to build up people who are following your son oh god would you lead us to those to those things that represent the heart of your son
[time=2578] the way he lived his life and we came to these five central priorities five discipleship disciplines if you will that Jesus modeled for those who chose to walk through that gate
[time=2592] those who chose to follow him five elements and elements that was just we chose the word elements remember the chemistry lesson we gave you there was a substance that we were after and substances are comprised the elements are what make up a substance and in this case the substance was we wanted to grow disciples and so the elements that went into that were so very important and we found these five elements because if i'm going to follow Jesus back to the gate back to the discussion of last week
[time=2630] if i'm going to follow Jesus i'm going to do what Jesus did
[time=2638] and that is exactly what Jesus invited people to then it's exactly what he's still inviting people to today to walk through that gate and down that road and follow him and if you're going to follow him here's five things here's the five elements that we came to i'm going to have Katie put them on the screen all at one time and i'm going to have her put them up there all at once because i want you to visually see them and i want to say this to you as well somebody asked me this last week as i was sharing some of this with them and we were talking about kind of what's to come in the next weeks and months here at black hawk and what my heart's desire is for this great endeavor that you and i are in on together they heard me talking about these five elements and they kind of got the sense that i was excited about these five things that we were pretty committed to communicating and encouraging you toward these five things and then the person asked me well what else are you excited about and i said to them nothing i'm not excited about anything other than
[time=2706] these elements i'm not excited about anything these days other than
[time=2715] you and i being a people who would at a very foundational level follow Jesus does that make sense well it turned into a great discussion because the guy said well wait man i got all kinds of other things i'm interested in and there's things i feel like i need in my wife and i need in our family needs you're telling me all you're going to do from now on to stand up and talk about these five things i said well i'll probably talk about things other than these five things but i said i want you to understand what i'm saying here and here's what i'm saying and here's what i want to make sure he understood and i want to make sure you understand this too look at those five things these are all right from the pages of the gospels in the book of x jesus made it a habit jesus again and again as you read through the gospels you see that jesus slipping away to prayerfully spend time with the who with the father jesus prayerfully abided jesus remained in relationship with god his father in a very personal in a very devoted in a very intimate and special way he makes time we see it again and again and we're inviting you to like jesus did make time to prayerfully abide with the father to make that relationship the priority relationship in your life
[time=2797] and when you prayerfully abide and when there is in you i'm going to make a point here at the end so bear with me and when you're devoted to scripture jesus oh uh in matthew four uh jesus is being tempted by the enemy
[time=2813] and we see this not only in matthew four but we see it again and again and again that jesus had this deep devotion to the word of who
[time=2822] to the word of god he says in matthew four it'll be on the screen i think but he answered and said it is written man shall not live on bread alone but on every what on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god jesus understood that that that with so many things at stake he needed to be and he
[time=2840] had to be grounded in and holding tightly to the foundation of god's word because it is a light unto our path it is a guide to you and i in the everyday of life and when you're prayerfully abiding when on a consistent basis you and i are meeting in intimacy with god when along with that there's this devotion the word means obstinate when we're committed to the scriptures as our final source of authority and our absolute source of hope and when there is back to the conversation i had with this guy i went on to say and then when on top of those two things there's a commitment in your life in mind to missionally serve the phrase missionally serve speaks to motive you say what's missional mean what missional means is simply and only this this is service that you and i would engage in that is so far beyond you and i checking off a box that there we did that
[time=2898] that's not how jesus served jesus served to further the what
[time=2905] jesus served to further the kingdom jesus served to meet needs jesus served to impact and make a difference in the lives of hurting people spiritually and physically and when you and i are characterized by a commitment to missionally mission purpose bigger picture serving when we
[time=2929] rake a yard when we build a handicap ramp when we cook a meal when we babysat me it doesn't matter what it is when you and i are doing that in an effort to fulfill the mission that god has called you and i too to go and make a difference in our world
[time=2947] so when you're prayerfully abiding and when you're devoted to scripture and when you're missionally serving i said to this guy and i'm saying to you this morning and then on top of those three things when you're engaged in when you're really engaged in community when you make a
[time=2965] an intentional choice to live in relationship with others in a smaller setting than this where stories get told and lives
[time=2975] get shared and struggles are voiced and prayers are sent up and confession is a regular part of living and and when we when we do what jesus did jesus did in state of those 12 guys meet me for class at 10 take good notes i'll quiz you on friday
[time=2995] jesus said come live with me come do ministry with me come sleep with me come eat with me come laugh with me come cry with me come do life together and in that i'll transform you and did he transform them yes he did so when you're prayerfully abiding and devoted to scripture and you're missionally serving and you're a part of transformational community and lastly when you understand fifth element that that's not all all those four endeavors aren't all about you they're not all for you being built up they're not all about your group being built up they're not all about just your understanding and your knowledge when you understand that all of that is so that we can make more disciples when you're really sensitive to the opportunities that god gives you with those that you live with and those that you work with and those in your family and you are willing to lovingly invite them to this to this life
[time=3053] okay here's my point did you did you stay with me so i say to this guy i believe that if we teach that
[time=3063] i believe if we make a big deal about that and if we make a big deal about it again and again and again i think an entire family engaged in this i think it absolutely transforms your marriage i think it absolutely transforms your home i think it absolutely transforms your business i think it absolutely transforms your relationships i think it absolutely transforms your heart i mean you pick the topic you want me to preach about and i'm just telling you if we just preach on this and we can do it different ways and we can come out from different angles but when we're together as a family utterly and absolutely devoted to this every part of your life and mind will be affected so don't quote me and don't go out and say he's
[time=3109] only going to preach the five elements for the next ten years but i'm kind of like sort of kind of saying that but i hope you understand the heart behind it for too many years and for too long we've talked about so many other things and i want us to think and give thought to these things Corbin and the team please make your way on up here and let me just say to the rest of you in the room the normal or the narrow road the narrow road is the life of a disciple the narrow road is the life of a disciple a life that leads to a rebirthing of a priesthood your priests we get the privilege of passing along god and i want to tell you this i can't tell you how many in the last couple weeks it's just gotten to be more and more and more people emailing me and talking to me about how grateful you are for the digging deeper material there's now a resource for all of you on our website on the home page where you can go and click on the digging deeper icon and you get to then just throughout the rest of your week with the material made available to you there you get to continue the sunday morning discussion if you will you get to research some things you get to study some things you get to look up some stuff and answer some questions and you can do it alone or you could do it with your spouse or you could do it with your small group or your sunday morning setting but i want you to know this week there'll be a chance for you in the digging deeper material there'll be a chance for you to really dig in on those five elements and we're going to keep inviting you towards those five we're going to keep teaching you we're going to keep lifting up this great value and this great benefit and this great joy of
[time=3211] following Jesus because that's what this thing's about i hope you'll click on there this week i hope you'll just listen here for a moment has been in Corbin lead us in some worship i think we'll get a chance to sing here in just a minute but just let your heart rest take in the great truth of these songs and we will together in the days to come follow our Lord
