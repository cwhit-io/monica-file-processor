[time=282] (audience applauds)
[time=290] - Well hello everybody, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=292] We're thankful as always that you've tuned in.
[time=294] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=299] And you're about to see a message this morning that is the first installment of what will be a six week series that we've entitled The Road to Recovery.
[time=309] We're talking these days at Blackhawk about celebrating recovery.
[time=314] That's right, recovery is oftentimes a phrase that's used in connection with addictions.
[time=320] The fact of the matter is that recovery is just another word for repentance.
[time=325] And addictions are just really sinful patterns that you and I experience in the everyday of life.
[time=332] That's right, sometimes we think addiction, we think alcohol and drugs.
[time=336] The fact of the matter is that no matter who you are, whether you're an 18 year old or a 65 year old, whether you're educated or uneducated, whether you live on this part of town or another part of town, no matter who you are, you and I struggle with sinful patterns.
[time=354] We become addicted as we experience the pull and the power of sin and the only thing that frees us from that, the only thing that can lead us to recovery is a relationship with Jesus Christ, a relationship in which he rules and not sin and its sinful desires.
[time=373] I can't wait for you to hear this series and I can't wait for you to tell others about it.
[time=379] The response in this last week has been enormous as we've begun to talk about giving people actually hope that they can be free from the sin and the struggle that has held them captive in many situations for years.
[time=392] So I hope no matter who you are, whether you're young or old, I hope you'll watch this morning and I hope you'll allow the spirit of God and the word of God to encourage you.
[time=402] There may be some things in your life that you haven't dealt with for a long, long time.
[time=406] There may be some patterns in your life that need to be addressed and maybe this will be over these next six weeks, a chance for you to address with God's help, those sinful endeavors.
[time=418] I also want to say this to you, you're more than welcome to come.
[time=422] Something about being here live and in person, I know is really helpful and we've seen people coming now as they've heard about this series.
[time=430] We've seen people coming who didn't used to come but now they know this is a place where they can come, a safe place to hear a life-changing, dangerous message.
[time=439] And I want to make sure you know you're invited.
[time=441] Come and be with us over these next six weeks as we celebrate this road to recovery and we'll pray that God will do miraculous things in your life and mine.
[time=451] Thanks for tuning in.
[time=452] Take care, God bless you.

[time=473] [MUSIC - 33 seconds]
[time=509] - What do we need to recover from?
[time=524] What do we need to repent of?
[time=531] Paul says to the church at Rome, we studied much of that book recently and I'll take you back to chapter seven where in verses 15 to 17, he said, I don't understand myself at all.
[time=544] For I really wanna do what is right, but I can't.
[time=549] I do what I don't want to do.
[time=553] I do what I hate.
[time=556] I know perfectly well what I'm doing is wrong, but I can't help myself.
[time=562] It is sin, sin inside me that is stronger than I am that makes me do these evil things.
[time=573] I don't understand myself at all for I really want to do what is right, but I can't.
[time=582] Romans seven, 15 through 17.
[time=586] My friends, we come this morning to the beginning of what will be a six week discussion, a six week study that we've entitled the road to recovery.
[time=595] I've already used the word repentance in just these first couple of minutes.
[time=599] You really can synonymously use the two words, the idea of moving away from the opposite direction of sin and the patterns of sin that so easily entangle us.
[time=611] These next six weeks are gonna be about this road, this journey, this movement away from sin toward that which is true and right and good.
[time=620] The road to recovery today's message entitled the first step, the first step to freedom.
[time=627] Recently, I read this a couple of weeks ago, a father was trying to take a nap on a Sunday afternoon, raise your hand if you enjoy a Sunday afternoon nap.
[time=637] Absolutely, what is it about a Sunday afternoon nap?
[time=640] It's just a beautiful thing.
[time=643] Dad was trying to enjoy a Sunday afternoon nap, but his little boy kept bugging him saying, "Daddy, I'm bored." So this dad, being the resourceful kind of guy that he was, made up a game.
[time=653] He found a picture of a globe in the newspaper, picture of the world, and he ripped it up in about 50 pieces and said, "Son, this is a puzzle.
[time=662] "I want you to put it all back together." He laid down to finish his nap, thinking he would get at least another hour or two, but in about 15 minutes, the little boy comes and whacks him on the floor.
[time=672] It says, "Daddy, I'm done." The guy can't believe what he's hearing.
[time=677] He says, "You're kidding me." The dad knew his son didn't know all the positions of the nations and the continents and things like that, and he said, "How did you do," and he was done.
[time=686] It was perfect.
[time=687] He said, "How did you do that?" The little boy said, "Daddy, it was easy." There was a picture of a person on the back page of that newspaper you ripped up, and when that person got put together, the world looked just right.
[time=704] We're beginning a new series today.
[time=709] We're calling it the road to recovering.
[time=711] It's going to work God's word, the truth of God, and the spirit of God, my friends, is going to work on your person.
[time=719] Really is amazing how much better the world looks when your person is put together, not the way you think it should be put together, not the way culture thinks it should be put together.
[time=729] It's amazing how much better it is when you and I are put together the way God designed you and I to be put together.
[time=737] We're going to talk about in this series how to handle, how to overcome the hurts in your life.
[time=743] You understand that you've been hurt, right?
[time=750] You understand that in a fallen world, see, this doesn't make you unique.
[time=757] See, a lot of heads all of a sudden dropping down.
[time=759] He's not looking at me.
[time=761] No, put your heads up.
[time=762] I'm talking to you.
[time=763] In this fallen world, filled with fallen people,
[time=769] some of whom did their best to raise you and me and some of whom didn't and filled with mistakes and shortcomings and challenges in a fallen world filled with fallen people, I guarantee you along the way you and I have been hurt.
[time=785] In this discussion, we're going to talk about overcoming and a God-honoring way, the hurts in your life, the habits that stem from those hurts, you and I have been hurt.
[time=802] It's just a fact.
[time=803] There's no arguing it.
[time=804] And in the midst of being hurt, we develop habits.
[time=807] We develop sinful patterns and habits that move us away from what's right and so many times those habits are tied to the experiences that we've endured.
[time=817] We're going to talk about overcoming the hurts in your life, the habits that stem from those hurts and the resulting hang-ups in pain that it all can lead to.
[time=826] The verse that we've chosen for our theme verse in our series, The Road to Recovery is Isaiah 57, 18.
[time=833] You'll see this on the screen here this morning.
[time=835] God speaking, what an amazing promise this is, what great truth this is for you and I, in the midst of this fallen world, impacted as we've been by the fallen nature of mankind.
[time=849] God says this, He says, I have seen how they acted, but I will heal them, I will lead them and help them, I will commit, I will comfort those who mourn, I offer peace to all near and far.
[time=863] This is a great promise of God.
[time=866] Notice there are five parts to recovery that God wants to do in your life in mind, five parts to the restoration process, the repenting that you and I can experience.
[time=878] God says, first of all, if you've been hurt and you have and I have been, God says, I want to what?
[time=884] I want to heal you.
[time=885] If you're confused, God says, I want to lead you through that confusion.
[time=892] If you've ever felt you were helpless to change anything, He says, I want to help you.
[time=896] God, the God of a universe is saying and promising to you this morning that He wants to help you change that.
[time=905] If you've ever felt that no one understands your problems and no one sympathizes with your struggle, God says to you, I want to comfort you.
[time=915] If you feel anxious and worried and afraid, God says, I want to offer you peace.
[time=921] The fact is my friends, we live in an imperfect world where hurt by other people, we hurt ourselves and we hurt others.
[time=931] The Bible says in Romans 3.23 that how many have sinned?
[time=935] Oh, that all have sinned.
[time=937] That means none of us in the room this morning, none of you listening online, none of you watching by way of the broadcast this morning are perfect.
[time=945] We have all blown it miserably.
[time=947] We've all made mistakes and we still struggle with that sinfulness.
[time=951] We all hurt and we all hurt others.
[time=954] This series, my friends, is for every single person listening.
[time=961] Everyone in this room needs repentance.
[time=964] What do you need to recover from?
[time=967] I've got a note sheet there for you.
[time=968] I hope you'll follow along as we go.
[time=970] What is it that we need to repent of?
[time=973] What is it that we need God's help in recovering from?
[time=976] The good news is this, regardless of the sin pattern that you need recovery from, whether it's emotional or financial or relational or spiritual, sexual or whatever else it might be.
[time=990] The good news is that the steps away from that sinful pattern are always the same.
[time=998] The principles for recovery, the principles for repentance away from sin are always found in God's word.
[time=1007] It's the original recovery manual, if you will.
[time=1010] And the basis, the foundation of any recovery effort is going to ever have any lasting, fruitful effect will always be the word of God.
[time=1021] Now, for the sake of our discussion in the weeks to come, we've summarized the principles of recovery around the word recovery.
[time=1028] You see it there, R-E-C-O-V-E-R-Y recovery.
[time=1031] We'll take a letter or two each week and look at eight summarized steps on the road to repentance, on the road to recovery.
[time=1040] The first step, if you see it there in your notes, you can fill this in, the first step this morning on this road to recovery is the R, and the R in recovery stands for realize.
[time=1052] Realize you and me have to do this.
[time=1055] We have to realize that I'm not God.
[time=1059] Now, that may just sound inane to you.
[time=1062] It may just sound completely inept.
[time=1064] I mean, you might be sitting there thinking, well, why in the world did you think I struggled with that?
[time=1069] Of course, I'm not God.
[time=1072] Well, listen, bear with me.
[time=1075] Let's think this through a bit.
[time=1077] It's realized I'm not God.
[time=1080] Let's admit that I'm powerless to control my tendency towards sin.
[time=1086] Is that making sense?
[time=1088] To realize that I'm not God.
[time=1091] To admit that I'm powerless, in and of myself, to control my tendencies towards sin and that my life left to just me and my own management and my own leadership and my own direction, my life left to just me is completely unmanageable.
[time=1107] Do you ever stay up late when you know you need to sleep?
[time=1112] Do you ever eat or drink more than you should?
[time=1117] Do you ever feel like you ought to exercise,
[time=1123] but you don't?
[time=1124] Do you ever know the right thing to do at work?
[time=1129] Do you ever know, sense in your heart, the right thing to do in that relationship at home?
[time=1135] Do you ever sense that right thing to do with your boyfriend or girlfriend?
[time=1139] And then you don't do it.
[time=1143] You do what's wrong.
[time=1145] Do you ever know something's wrong, but you do it anyway.
[time=1148] Have you ever known you should be unselfish but you're selfish instead?
[time=1151] Have you ever tried to control somebody or something and found it was what, uncontrollable?
[time=1159] We're all, every single one of us in this room,
[time=1165] every one of us in need of recovery from our tendencies toward sin.
[time=1170] What's the cause?
[time=1172] Follow along there on your notes sheet.
[time=1173] What's the cause of my problem?
[time=1176] The cause, my friends, of your problems.
[time=1178] The cause of my problems.
[time=1181] The cause when it comes to these tendencies towards sin is our sin nature.
[time=1185] The Bible has a word for this tendency.
[time=1187] It's called my sinful nature.
[time=1190] You might wanna write that down.
[time=1191] My sin nature gets me in all kinds of problems.
[time=1194] And when I say my sin nature gets me, I guess right here for a moment, I'm just talking about me.
[time=1201] I sent you an email this week.
[time=1205] I don't know how many of you are on my email list.
[time=1208] If you're not, you can get on that list by just going to our website there and clicking on the email list signup thing.
[time=1214] But I sent you an email this week.
[time=1216] I just felt like as we started this series, it was important for me to talk to you about my own addiction and about my own sinful patterns.
[time=1225] And addiction and sinful patterns that I continue to beg God for help with each and every day of my life.
[time=1234] And I won't get into all that this morning.
[time=1236] If you wanna read that, you can go to my blog this week.
[time=1238] I think it'll be posted there on my blog, maybe even today, and you can read through that note that I sent out.
[time=1243] I want you to understand something.
[time=1244] We're in this together.
[time=1245] My sin nature gets me in all kinds of problems.
[time=1252] I do things that aren't good for me.
[time=1256] I do them even when they are self-destructive and I don't do things that are constructive, that are good for me.
[time=1266] I respond the wrong way when I'm hurt and it just increases the hurt rather than lessening it.
[time=1271] I react the wrong way to people.
[time=1274] I treat them in wrong ways and I know it's not going to work and then sure enough, it backfires and things just get uglier.
[time=1280] I try to fix problems and often when I fix them, they end up worse than they were when I began trying to fix them and I'm reminded each and every time write smack dab in the midst of that kind of ugliness and tartness and frustration of what it says in Proverbs 14.
[time=1298] There is a way that seems right to man but it ends in death.
[time=1302] It's important that you and I understand as we set out on this journey together that every one of us will always have this side of heaven.
[time=1314] Those of you in the room who know the Lord, those of you in the room who have fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, even us, those of us that know him.
[time=1323] We will, until that day we're with him, we will struggle and fight against this thing called our sin nature.
[time=1331] Paul understood it very well.
[time=1333] He said in Romans seven, as I read to you earlier, I don't understand myself at all for I really want to do what's right but I can't, I do what I don't want to do, I do what I hate.
[time=1347] Does this sound vaguely familiar to anybody in the room this morning besides me?
[time=1352] Could I get a little louder, yes or a more?
[time=1358] Thank you, it's a little vulnerable out here on the limb.
[time=1362] Just want to make sure somebody's out here with me.
[time=1365] Thank you.
[time=1366] The first step to recovery, the first step to repentance, my friends, is that you must understand the cause of our problem.
[time=1376] The cause of my problem, the cause of your problem is that you, listen, you want to be God.
[time=1382] We do, we say, I don't want anybody telling me what's right and what's wrong.
[time=1388] I want to call my own shots.
[time=1390] I want to make my own rules.
[time=1391] I want to put myself at the center of my world.
[time=1393] I want to be my own boss, live my own way.
[time=1395] If it feels good, I'm going to do it.
[time=1398] If it makes me happy, I'll get more.
[time=1400] I don't want anybody telling me what to do with my life and that my friends is called playing God.
[time=1407] And what it says about you and what it says about me is that we want control.
[time=1414] This independence from God, this unwillingness to trust Him and this demand that we will take care of it, whatever it is, is at the very foundation of this sin problem.
[time=1429] It's called playing God.
[time=1432] This is man's, this is not, please hear me.
[time=1434] This is not man's newest problem.
[time=1436] This is man's oldest problem.
[time=1437] This started way back.
[time=1439] Where am I turning to the book of what?
[time=1442] You can go back, you can go back to Genesis 3.
[time=1445] You should read it, you really should.
[time=1447] Read it again today.
[time=1448] Having listened and having thought through this stuff with us, go back and read through Genesis 3.
[time=1453] It's the oldest problem alive.
[time=1455] Adam and Eve had it.
[time=1457] God put them, remember, we'll summarize here.
[time=1459] Remember, God put them in the garden.
[time=1460] God put Adam and Eve in absolute utter paradise and they tried to control it.
[time=1467] You remember what happened as the serpent came tempted Eve?
[time=1472] God said you can do anything you want in this entire paradise except one thing.
[time=1477] God said the one thing you can't do is don't eat from this certain tree.
[time=1481] What did they do?
[time=1482] They beeline in essence to the tree.
[time=1485] And there the enemy makes his pitch.
[time=1488] There the enemy says you will be like God.
[time=1491] There the enemy says your eyes will be open.
[time=1493] You will be in control.
[time=1496] And there it is that Eve and Adam eat.
[time=1499] It's been the problem from the very beginning.
[time=1502] I want to be God.
[time=1503] I want to call the shots.
[time=1504] I want to run my own life.
[time=1506] I will function independently from God.
[time=1508] You can fill this in.
[time=1509] How do we play God by denying our humanity and by trying to control everything and you could even add everyone for selfish reasons?
[time=1521] So how do we play God?
[time=1522] Write these down.
[time=1524] How do we play God?
[time=1525] Number one, we try to control.
[time=1527] This has been going on from the beginning.
[time=1528] We try to control our image.
[time=1530] My goodness, do I do this?
[time=1533] And I won't speak for you, but I bet I could speak for a lot of you.
[time=1536] We try to control our image.
[time=1538] You want to control what other people think of you.
[time=1543] You don't want, sorry, I'll be okay in a second.
[time=1549] You don't want other people to really know what you're like.
[time=1553] It's why it was hard for me to press send on that email I sent you this week.
[time=1559] We don't want other people to really know what we struggle with.
[time=1565] We play games, we wear masks, we lie, we pretend, we fake it.
[time=1569] We want people to see certain sides of us and yet we hide other sides of us and we deny our weaknesses and we deny our feelings.
[time=1577] I'm not angry.
[time=1578] I'm not upset.
[time=1579] I'm not worried.
[time=1580] I'm not afraid.
[time=1581] I'm not insecure.
[time=1583] I'm not wounded.
[time=1584] I'm not abusive.
[time=1586] We don't want people to see the real us.
[time=1590] Why?
[time=1593] Why was it so hard to press send this week when I sent that to all of you?
[time=1600] Why do you work so hard to keep me from seeing the real you?
[time=1606] Why do I work so hard to hide that from people in my life?
[time=1611] You know why?
[time=1612] Because if I tell you who I really am and you don't like it, which if I tell you who I really am, you probably won't.
[time=1620] And if you don't like it, then you'll leave.
[time=1624] And I don't want you to leave.
[time=1628] If you read my email, you understand why.
[time=1630] Because if you leave, then I'm all alone.
[time=1635] It's just stuck with me and I'm all I've got and that's no good.
[time=1640] So I don't tell you who I really am and I would never share with you all the things I truly struggle with because I want you to like me.
[time=1648] We try to control our image.
[time=1652] We try to control other people.
[time=1655] Write that down.
[time=1655] Number two, we try to control other people.
[time=1657] Parents try to control kids.
[time=1660] How's that one going?
[time=1661] Parents try to control kids and that doesn't work.
[time=1666] Kids just end up getting resentful.
[time=1668] Kids try to control parents.
[time=1672] Hey gang, that doesn't work.
[time=1674] You just end up living in futility and with this lack of wisdom that got designed you to get from those two who you've tried to push away.
[time=1683] Wives try to control husbands.
[time=1685] Doesn't work so well.
[time=1688] He just gets fed up and tired and goes elsewhere.
[time=1692] Husbands try to control wives.
[time=1696] Doesn't work so well.
[time=1699] She either fights back and tries to control you or she just gives up and goes away either literally or emotionally.
[time=1706] People try to control other people.
[time=1710] We manipulate each other.
[time=1711] We use guilt to control.
[time=1713] We use fear.
[time=1714] We use praise.
[time=1715] Some of you use the silent treatment.
[time=1717] Some use anger and rage.
[time=1719] We try to control people so we can get from them what we want because in our sinfulness from the very beginning in the garden we've been trying to play who?
[time=1731] God.
[time=1732] Number three, we try to control our problems.
[time=1734] We try to control our image, other people and our issues.
[time=1738] We're good at this.
[time=1739] We use phrases like I can handle it.
[time=1742] It's really not a problem, we say.
[time=1745] I'm okay, really, I'm fine.
[time=1747] I don't need any help and I certainly don't need counseling.
[time=1751] We try to control our problems.
[time=1753] I can quit anytime.
[time=1755] I'll work it out on my own and the more you and I try to fix our problems, ourselves, the worse the problems get.
[time=1764] Fourthly, write this down.
[time=1766] We try to control our pain.
[time=1769] Remember what we talked about at the beginning of this talk?
[time=1771] All of us have been what?
[time=1774] Have you ever thought about how much time you spend running from your pain?
[time=1782] Trying to avoid it, trying to deny it, trying to escape it, trying to reduce it, trying to postpone it?
[time=1788] People try to postpone pain in a number of different ways.
[time=1792] Sometimes we try to postpone pain by taking our mind off the pain and eating.
[time=1798] Sometimes we postpone it by not eating.
[time=1801] Sometimes we try to postpone our pain or take the edge off our pain by getting drunk or smoking or by taking drugs or by getting in and out of relationships.
[time=1814] I hear it all the time.
[time=1816] This next relationship will be the one.
[time=1818] I know, they say.
[time=1820] He is, I'm convinced he is what I really need to feel really whole and significant and you get in that relationship and oops, it didn't work.
[time=1833] He wasn't it.
[time=1835] She didn't meet all your needs and it's in and out, in and out of one relationship after another or you develop some kind of compulsive habit.
[time=1845] You've got this pain over here and so you just become obsessively compulsive in all kinds of ways, doing all kinds of things to keep yourself busy and distracted from the fact that things aren't right down deep in your soul.
[time=1859] You become abusive.
[time=1863] You get angry with other people, critical, judgmental to hide your own inadequacies in pain.
[time=1870] Pain comes my friends when we realize in our quiet moments that we're not God and we can't control everything and that is absolutely scary and that's the first step to recovery.
[time=1883] Stop playing God because you know what?
[time=1886] The fact of the matter is you cannot control your image, you cannot control other people, you cannot control your problems and you cannot control your pain.
[time=1894] The good news today is that somebody else can
[time=1900] and we'll get to that.
[time=1902] In just a moment.
[time=1903] Roman numeral two, what are the consequences of this activity?
[time=1909] When you and I give ourselves to this kind of endeavor, what happens?
[time=1914] I mean, we've just clearly established it's not gonna go too well.
[time=1917] It doesn't go very well and when we try to make it go well, things get really sideways.
[time=1923] Four problems that always happen, always.
[time=1925] When we try to play God.
[time=1928] Number one, fear.
[time=1929] This is again, right from the text.
[time=1930] This is right from the Genesis account.
[time=1932] It's a very biblical concept.
[time=1935] Fear takes place.
[time=1937] When I try to control everything, I get fearful.
[time=1941] What do I mean?
[time=1942] Well, Adam said in Genesis three, remember, Adam and Eve sinned, they eat the fruit, they weren't supposed to eat.
[time=1950] God comes walking in the garden.
[time=1952] The text implies doing what he had done often in the past, coming to walk with them in the garden, but this time they're not walking with him, this time they're what?
[time=1960] They're hiding from him.
[time=1962] God finds Adam and Eve.
[time=1964] He says, hey, what is up?
[time=1965] What happened?
[time=1966] What went down?
[time=1967] And Adam says, basically, I was afraid.
[time=1970] God says, why are you hiding from me?
[time=1974] He says, I was afraid because I was naked and so I hid.
[time=1979] Naked, exposed.
[time=1981] All the fault, all the failure, right there.
[time=1984] See, we're afraid somebody's gonna find out who we really are that we're fake, that we're phony, that we really don't have it all together, that we're not perfect, that we're actually a mess.
[time=1998] So nobody gets close to me because if they do, they'll find out I'm empty and so we fake it and consequently fill our lives with fear.
[time=2008] Afraid that somebody's going to reject this, afraid that somebody's not gonna love us or not like us when they see what we're really truly like.
[time=2016] We get filled with fear, just like Adam when we try to play God.
[time=2022] Number two, write this down.
[time=2023] We get filled up with frustration.
[time=2025] It's frustrating somebody once said, trying to be the general manager of the universe.
[time=2032] I was reading a story about Chuck E. Cheese
[time=2038] this last week and it reminded me, I used to like taking my kids to Chuck E. Cheese.
[time=2044] The key word there would be I used to.
[time=2047] I don't know if we've got any Chuck E. Cheese people in the room, I mean let's all be honest, it's fun for the first couple of years.
[time=2052] But when you get about three, four, five years into this thing, it can be an absolute drain.
[time=2058] But I remember when it was fun going to Chuck E. Cheese and there was this game that I always like to play, raise your hand if you remember that game where you put the tokens in, you grab that mallet and those things pop up and you just whack it.
[time=2074] Kind of a therapeutical thing there at Chuck E. Cheese in my opinion because you can get so wound up and keyed up and frustrated.
[time=2080] The moment you hit one down, another one pops up.
[time=2086] It's frustrating because every time you slam one down, another pops up and then you slam that one down and another pops up and you get that one and this one pops up and you know what, that's life.
[time=2098] I mean it's life beyond Chuck E. Cheese.
[time=2101] It's just everyday life in an effort to play God.
[time=2105] We whack down one compulsion and another one pops up.
[time=2108] We whack down one sin and another challenge, another temptation pops up.
[time=2113] We whack down one relational conflict and another relationship goes south.
[time=2118] It's so frustrating because you can't get them all knocked down at the same time.
[time=2123] You walk around pretending you're God like you're powerful and you can handle it but the fact of the matter is you can't, the frustration is overwhelming and we might as well just walk around to the back of the dumb machine and unplug it.
[time=2137] It's the only way we're ever gonna get through that one.
[time=2140] Paul realized this in Romans 7, 21 and 23.
[time=2143] It seems to be a fact of life that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong.
[time=2152] Something else Paul says is deep within me, that war with my mind that wins the fight and makes me a slave to sin, frustration.
[time=2165] David understood it in the Psalms where he said, my dishonesty makes me miserable and filled my days with frustration.
[time=2173] Fatigue, write that one down.
[time=2179] Fatigue, we get filled up with fatigue.
[time=2181] It's tiring playing God.
[time=2185] It's hard, where's you out trying to control everything and every one and every circumstance in your life?
[time=2194] David in Psalm 32, four and five I think said my strength, listen to this, my strength he said evaporated like water on a sunny day until I finally admitted all my sins to you, oh God, and stopped trying to hide them.
[time=2216] Most people try to hide their pain and run from the pain by keeping busy because we think I don't like the way the pain feels.
[time=2225] I don't like what I think when I slow down.
[time=2228] I don't like the sounds or the thoughts that run through my mind when I lay my head back on my pillow at night.
[time=2235] So I just keep busy.
[time=2237] You run from pain by constantly being on the go, working yourself to the bone at and away from work.
[time=2245] You get into some hobby or some sport and it becomes a compulsion and you're on the golf course all the time or you're scrapbooking too much or hunting too much or shopping too much.
[time=2259] You can even get compulsively involved in spiritual activity.
[time=2263] Did you realize this?
[time=2266] Church activity can hide your pain.
[time=2268] You're hoping that you'll be so tired that when you lay your head down on the pillow that you'll go to sleep and you won't have to hear racing through your heart and mind the painful realities of your life.
[time=2281] If you're in a constant state of fatigue, always worn out, ask yourself what pain am I running from?
[time=2288] What problem, what sin do I not want to face up to that motivates and drives me to work and work and go and go and deny and deny so that I'm in this constant state of fatigue?
[time=2302] Number four, failure.
[time=2304] That's right.
[time=2305] When you try to play God, that is a job description, my friends, that you are guaranteed to fail at.
[time=2313] It will not go well.
[time=2316] Proverbs 28, 13, you see it there.
[time=2320] You'll never succeed in life if you try to hide your sins.
[time=2325] If you try to hide your addictions, if you try to hide your sinful patterns, if you try to hide these things, it'll never work, confess them, the writer of Proverbs said, confess them, give them up.
[time=2340] And God will show mercy to you.
[time=2341] You need to be honest and open about your weaknesses,
[time=2348] your faults and your failures.
[time=2350] My friends at Blackhawk these days, we have a growing desire to be a, I think the best word that keeps coming to my mind is we have a growing desire here at Blackhawk these days to be a gracious people.
[time=2365] To be a gracious place, an authentic place where people, all people, red, yellow, black and white, rich, poor, educated, uneducated, doesn't matter, where you live, what your past is, what your family did, nothing, just a place where all people can talk about the real problems and the real hurts and the real hang-ups and the real habits and not be as a result of that kind of openness, not be blown away by the judgment of others, but instead realize that we are a family of fellow struggleers, disciples, followers of Christ who are in process, if you will.
[time=2410] And to help all of us, anyone in the room this morning, anybody listening online, anybody watching on the broadcast to help all of us further engage and to encourage us in this journey toward repentance and recovery.
[time=2426] I'm so grateful for our Celebrate Recovery team, a team of people who have faithfully been preparing, not only has they've helped me with this series, but beginning on May 8th and then from then on on Friday nights here at Blackhawk.
[time=2442] There will be a Celebrate Recovery gathering.
[time=2446] They have Celebrate Recovery gatherings at Fellowship Missionary at the chapel at Pathway.
[time=2451] There is a collaborative effort these days among churches to provide a place for those who are serious and honest and sincere in their efforts to move away from sin to come and be a part of a gathering and then also on those nights be a part of smaller groups and settings where accountability and prayer and encouragement and honest speaking the truth and love type things can go on.
[time=2474] And I'm so thrilled that we're gonna be able to do this beginning May 8th and I went to a Celebrate Recovery, actually I've been to a couple now, gatherings.
[time=2485] I went one night about a year and a half ago and it was at that event over at Fellowship.
[time=2492] I actually met a gal who's told me a little bit of her story.
[time=2496] She ended up writing me later and I wanted to read this to you.
[time=2500] She said this about her journey.
[time=2503] Pastor Bird it was an honor to meet you.
[time=2505] The other night I've watched the Bible Hour for six years and can honestly say that at times you're broadcast you'll love this.
[time=2514] Your broadcast, your willingness to teach the truth and love and your son's ability to lead worship.
[time=2521] (laughing) I just love it.
[time=2526] I think he's my son and I wouldn't mind him.
[time=2529] I mean, Dave and Laurie have done great.
[time=2531] I claim no responsibility for that but it's just funny.
[time=2534] I should probably write her back.
[time=2536] To this day she thinks he's my son but anyway.
[time=2539] Your son's ability to lead worship are the only things that have kept me going.
[time=2544] I mentioned to you the other night when we met that God has used Celebrate Recovery to completely transform my life.
[time=2550] A life that was broken and hopeless and seemingly beyond repair.
[time=2554] I had been married for about two years when it became clear that I was addicted to unruly rage and anger.
[time=2561] I was overly critical and mean-spirited and negative toward my husband in most encounters and even though I knew it was wrong and would in time diminish his love for me, I continued in my sin and refused to seek the help I desperately needed to soften a heart and hurtful heart.
[time=2580] The tragedy of my addiction, Pastor Bird, is that the tragedy of my addiction, Pastor Bird, and the sin that I had committed was that it led to more.
[time=2590] That's right, my husband in time shut himself off completely from my regular outbursts and my controlling negativity and became lost in his own sinful commitment to work, pornography and eventually another woman.
[time=2605] At the eight year mark of our marriage, we were completely enslaved to our sin and while at times we both made efforts toward recovery, nothing ever really changed and the destructive cycle simply continued.
[time=2618] Two years ago, a persistent friend of mine invited me to celebrate recovery gathering on a Thursday night and it was there that I realized for the very first time where my anger and controlling patterns came from and most importantly, what the cure was to these addictions that had destroyed my heart and marriage.
[time=2639] I eventually began to attend the Sunday morning gathering at my French church and began to experience the life changing transformation I've often heard you refer to as the word of God, the spirit of God and the people of God coming together.
[time=2654] My husband has actually started to attend celebrate recovery with me and while we're nowhere near healthy or restored, I'm hopeful for the first time in years that the healing power of the gospel can be ours and that freedom from sins, addictive powers will one day be realized.
[time=2675] Amen?
[time=2676] Well, how do you react to that kind of a story?
[time=2680] How do you process that as you hear that?
[time=2685] Here would be two ways that you might be tempted to react.
[time=2690] These would be two ways I would hope you wouldn't though.
[time=2695] One way that we react to a story like that is we say bless her heart, I'm thankful that she's doing better and thankful that that's how all that worked out but my problem's not that bad.
[time=2704] Many of you are sitting in this room right now saying my problem's not that bad.
[time=2710] It's called denial.
[time=2713] How bad does it have to get before you admit you need the healing power of the gospel?
[time=2720] How bad does that hurt, that relationship, that pain, that consequence, that problem, that memory have to get before you admit that you desperately need help and healing?
[time=2731] I read this week that unfortunately it is human behavior that we rarely change until our pain becomes greater than the fear of change.
[time=2743] It is the fear of change that oftentimes leads us over here stuck in this painful dishonoring to God place.
[time=2752] We don't change when we see the light.
[time=2755] We change when we feel the heat and the marriage starts falling apart or the kids start going off the wrong way or you get that phone call in the middle of the night and this one guy I was reading said save yourself.
[time=2767] Save yourself some pain.
[time=2769] Start now today on your road to repentance and recovery.
[time=2774] One man said it this way, it happened to me.
[time=2778] Things began to get healthy and God honoring.
[time=2781] He said it happened to me when the acid of my pain finally ate through the wall of my denial.
[time=2790] God whispers to us in our pleasures, I love this, God whispers to us in our pleasures, God shouts to us in our what?
[time=2800] Pain is God's, pain is God's megaphone.
[time=2804] Let it motivate you my friends to pursue him, to ask for help to face the issue that you've been ignoring, 10, 20, maybe 30 years.
[time=2814] Second reaction to a story like that that I wouldn't want you to have is that's fine for her but I can solve my own problem.
[time=2824] It's called denial too.
[time=2826] Unless you've had a perfect life, there's some things you need to let Christ and the word of God and the spirit of God deal with, you say, well I don't need Christ, I can handle my own problems, I can take care of it.
[time=2841] Well the fact is if you could handle it, you would have.
[time=2846] But you haven't, have you?
[time=2849] If you could have handled that problem, it wouldn't be a problem.
[time=2854] You wouldn't still have it today, it still wouldn't be eating away at you and affecting the everyday of your life like it is.
[time=2860] They ran, I think it's interesting, they ran and hid behind the bush.
[time=2867] God had made them and God had made the bush and they're hiding from God behind the bush.
[time=2873] Just think about how silly that is.
[time=2876] Well what's the cure?
[time=2882] Roman numeral three, the cure.
[time=2885] The first step on the road to recovery is to admit my powerlessness, I'm not God.
[time=2891] The Bible says that in admitting my weakness I find strength.
[time=2896] Now I understand this isn't a popular American culture, self-sufficient society ideal.
[time=2903] I understand that we all got taught to raise ourselves up by our bootstraps and not to depend on anyone else.
[time=2911] But this is the essential first step and I don't want you to miss it.
[time=2915] It's the first step to God bringing healing.
[time=2918] Admit your powerless to do it on your own.
[time=2921] You need God and His truth for it is the truth of God that sets you free.
[time=2928] Cause comes, the cure, excuse me, the cure comes when you recognize these three facts of life.
[time=2934] You can see this on your note sheet.
[time=2936] Here's where the cure comes.
[time=2937] When you recognize these three facts of life I admit that I am powerless to change my past.
[time=2946] I admit that I am powerless to change my past.
[time=2951] Listen people, it hurt, I know it did.
[time=2954] I've experienced it with you.
[time=2956] I still remember it, but all the resentment or anger in the world isn't going to change it.
[time=2962] I am powerless to change my past and the only one who can change the impact of my past.
[time=2970] The only one who can change the effect my past has on me today is Christ.
[time=2976] The only thing that can change or alter the past is the one thing that has changed and altered the past and that is the cross.
[time=2986] And you and I are completely powerless to change it
[time=2992] and you and I have to admit it.
[time=2993] Number two, I admit that I am powerless to control other people.
[time=2997] I try, I like to manipulate them.
[time=2999] I use all kinds of little gimmicks, but it doesn't work.
[time=3003] I am responsible for my actions, not theirs.
[time=3006] I can't control other people.
[time=3009] You can't either.
[time=3011] The only one who can control and change and transform other people is Jesus.
[time=3018] The only place that ever gets accomplished is at the cross.
[time=3022] Only Jesus can change the past.
[time=3028] Only Jesus can control other people.
[time=3033] The cross is where the power is found.
[time=3035] To see all of those things come to fruition.
[time=3038] Number three, write this down.
[time=3039] I admit that I am powerless to cope with my harmful habits, my behaviors and actions.
[time=3050] Good intentions are not enough.
[time=3053] How many times have you tried and failed to somehow get this thing under control?
[time=3059] You need a healing source of power beyond yourself.
[time=3065] You need the Lord.
[time=3069] You need God.
[time=3071] You know why?
[time=3072] Because he made you to need him.
[time=3080] He didn't make you to need the bottle.
[time=3084] He didn't make you to need him or her.
[time=3086] He didn't make you to need the outburst of anger.
[time=3088] He didn't make you to need any of those things that you and I can run to at times.
[time=3093] He made you to need who, him.
[time=3096] And it's in relationship with who, him, that you and I are made whole.
[time=3101] I'm gonna ask Corbin and the guys to come up.
[time=3105] Can't wait for you to hear the song.
[time=3107] James 4-6, my friends, listen, please listen.
[time=3109] God says, it says in 4-6, God opposes the proud and gives grace to the humble.
[time=3116] You see that on the screen there?
[time=3119] God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[time=3122] Grace, listen, grace is the power to change.
[time=3127] Grace is the power God gives me to make the changes in my life I desperately need.
[time=3133] And for you to repent from hurts, for you to recover from habits and hang ups in your life, you need God's grace.
[time=3142] How do you get it?
[time=3144] Only one way.
[time=3145] You know who he gives it to?
[time=3148] This power to change.
[time=3150] This power to be miraculously whole again?
[time=3155] You know who he gives it to?
[time=3157] He gives it to the humble.
[time=3158] He gives it to the broken.
[time=3162] He gives it to the one who's willing to bow the knee of their heart and fully surrender themselves.
[time=3169] Trusting Christ to take away a past.
[time=3173] Trusting Christ to deal with and transform others as he will.
[time=3181] Recovery, repentance.
[time=3185] That means being honest and facing problems and sin that you've wanted to ignore for a long time.
[time=3192] And I want to invite you this morning, join me, would you?
[time=3197] Join me as I face with you over these next several weeks, some of these pains and some of these challenges and some of these hurts, join me and let's together walk this road to recovery.
[time=3210] There is, as you and I walk toward repentance away from sin, there is a prayer that I want you to be willing to say and it's captured in the chorus of this song.
[time=3221] Listen, listen closely, be encouraged.
[time=3223] I'll come back up in just a moment.
[time=3239] [MUSIC - 292 seconds]
