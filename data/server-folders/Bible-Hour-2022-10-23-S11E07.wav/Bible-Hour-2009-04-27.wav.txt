[time=420] (audience applauding) - How you all doing?
[time=436] That was for all of you who have a little southern gospel running through your veins.
[time=439] All right, which I found out when I came to...
[time=441] (audience applauding) There you go, I like that.
[time=443] (audience applauding) My name is Kevin McIntyre.
[time=447] Of course, I brought you to Pastor at County Line.
[time=449] It's such a privilege to be here with you today.
[time=451] Can't wait to steal these guys away.
[time=453] Bring them to our church in a couple of weeks.
[time=455] But that song is a song that we've sung for a long time.
[time=458] I love the message of it.
[time=460] And we're gonna have the privilege of hearing from a lady by the name of Mary Edder this morning.
[time=465] Who's just gonna share briefly with you the change that God has made in her life.
[time=469] When that happened, and just in detail surrounding that.
[time=472] So, Mary.
[time=475] And as I sang the songs today, it's really a testimony of my life.
[time=480] Every single song we sang is a testimony.
[time=484] I wanna take you back way back as a little girl.
[time=489] I was brought up Catholic.
[time=491] And in the Catholic church, we had this little prayer book.
[time=494] And as far back as I could remember, I guess I really wanted to know God.
[time=498] And I remember on my knees for hours at a time, I would kneel with that little prayer book.
[time=504] And pray.
[time=507] Life wasn't really good as a child.
[time=512] But I continued to pray out of that little prayer book, those little repetitious little prayers.
[time=519] Life went on and I grew older.
[time=522] And through some tough times, I realized there was something missing, something missing.
[time=529] All those little prayers didn't seem to be doing it.
[time=533] Something was missing.
[time=535] Well, as I became an adult, there came a point in my life where I just left religion all together.
[time=545] And I watched how God continued to draw me in spite of myself, closer and closer to Him.
[time=555] And through some loving friends who knew the Lord, I finally began to believe that Jesus
[time=562] was the answer to my life.
[time=564] And I began to understand the reality of Him in that personhood of Christ.
[time=571] And back in the fall of 75, I gave my heart and life to Him.
[time=578] Now, since then, God has seen me through the loss of my daughter and an illness which changed my life.
[time=587] And what I want to say to you is the change really is knowing that God is here for every
[time=597] single thing we face in life, the ups, the downs, the tough times.
[time=603] And He is there when no one else is there.
[time=607] He wants to make a change in you this day too.
[time=610] And I thank Him for that.

[time=2099] He sat up in his bed with his eyes wide open and said, "Oh my," at the time I was thinking
[time=2105] he was in great pain.
[time=2107] I could not comprehend what was happening, but the stare and the wide look in his eye was something I never saw from him before.
[time=2114] I can say dad was looking somewhere he had never seen before.
[time=2119] He was on his way to heaven and seeing what God has waiting for us all.
[time=2126] God, the CR program and other Christ's followers have helped me prepare for this time.
[time=2131] And I was available to be used by God to do his work.
[time=2134] I know today, as the Serenity Prayer says, I can be reasonably happy in this life and
[time=2140] supremely happy with him forever in the next.
[time=2144] The struggles of this world can be overwhelmingly difficult alone.
[time=2151] We don't need to be alone.
[time=2153] Our recovery is available for us to begin or to continue a process to grow towards Christ.
[time=2159] We need to work hard to get closer to Jesus and to make that our number one priority.
[time=2163] His arms are extended for us all.
[time=2165] We just need to turn to him.
[time=2167] I've dedicated my life to following him.
[time=2170] And someday it will be my time to see heaven, just like my dad saw on his way to heaven, and be able to say, "Oh my, oh my, oh my." Thank you for letting me share.
[time=2183] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2188] Thank you, Art.
[time=2189] I asked Art to come be a part of this hour this morning for two reasons.
[time=2195] First, to give you the hope of what God can do in changing a person's life.
[time=2202] And secondly, to know that God raises people up out of their hurts to use their pain to
[time=2210] help somebody else on the road to recovery.
[time=2213] So if you're in pain this morning, the book of 2 Corinthians, the first chapter, says God will comfort you so that you, in turn, can comfort others with the same comfort that
[time=2225] you receive from God.
[time=2227] Art, thank you.
[time=2229] Well here is point number two, step number two, earnestly believe that God exists and
[time=2235] that I matter to him and he has the power to change my life.
[time=2242] He has the power to help me recover.
[time=2247] Point number one is earnestly believe that God exists.
[time=2253] There are many valid intellectual reasons to believe that God exists.
[time=2259] Since man has walked the steps of the earth, we have known that there is a God.
[time=2267] One of the sources of evidence we have is the universe with its cause and intentional
[time=2275] existence, its design and its intricacy.
[time=2282] Way back as far as the 4th century BC, Aristotle reasoned that there had to be some force,
[time=2290] some intelligent power that brought the universe into existence.
[time=2296] He reasoned in this fashion, Aristotle would observe that for something to exist, it had
[time=2303] to have a cause, that the world is a result of cause and effect.
[time=2310] But as he moved back from the effect to the cause, he realized that cause had to have
[time=2318] a cause.
[time=2319] So he looked for the preceding cause and found it only to discover that that also had
[time=2325] to have a preceding cause and that had to have a preceding cause and that had to have a preceding cause.
[time=2331] So Aristotle said there has to be an uncaused cause.
[time=2338] In other ways he phrased it, there had to be an unmoved mover and by that he meant
[time=2344] there had to be some force that was intelligent enough to create all of this order.
[time=2353] And powerful enough that he could take his will and his creativity and make it happen.
[time=2361] Now we're talking 400 BC.
[time=2366] And ever since then, brilliant minds have talked about the cosmological reason to believe
[time=2373] there is a God, cause and effect.
[time=2376] We've heard scholars over the centuries talk about the teleological argument, intricacy
[time=2382] and design.
[time=2385] There are other arguments, but perhaps the most compelling reason why you should believe that there is a God today is that you are here.
[time=2396] You're in this room.
[time=2398] You might have rather have preferred to have gone to the golf course or to the brunch,
[time=2405] but you're here.
[time=2407] And the fact that you're here reveals that inside you, you sense a need for God.
[time=2416] You came this morning because intuitively you are wired to know God.
[time=2425] Pascal said that God has created each of us with a vacuum shaped so that only he can
[time=2432] fill it.
[time=2435] Rather fascinating, a man by the name of Dean Hammer, who is a geneticist and the director
[time=2442] of gene structure and regulation at the United States Cancer Institute, wrote a book titled
[time=2450] The God Gene.
[time=2453] It is his belief that you and I are hardwired to believe in God.
[time=2460] I don't know whether his scientific genetic study is valid, I'm not prepared, qualified
[time=2466] in any way to evaluate that, but I can tell you, he echoes Romans chapter 1 and 2 where
[time=2472] the Bible says God has put the knowledge that he exists in each one of us.
[time=2478] You're here today not because you couldn't think of anything else to do on a Sunday morning, but because you are either a believer in God or a searcher for God.
[time=2492] This second step begins by earnestly believing there is a God, that I'm not in this alone.
[time=2499] I am not abandoned.
[time=2501] I have help in the form of a loving creator.
[time=2505] Now you may have fallen under the same influences that I did as an academic student and being
[time=2511] told that faith is a crutch, it's a sign of a weakness.
[time=2517] That in the academic world, faith is sort of leaping into the dark and hoping that there
[time=2525] is some wire to land and someone to catch you.
[time=2528] But I love the writing of John Pokinghorn.
[time=2531] Pokinghorn is a quantum physicist at the University of Cambridge.
[time=2536] He is also a deep believer in Jesus Christ.
[time=2540] Pokinghorn wrote, "Faith is not a question of shutting one's eyes, gridding one's teeth,
[time=2549] and believing the impossible.
[time=2552] It involves a leap, but a leap into the light rather than into the dark."
[time=2561] Earnestly believe that God exists.
[time=2563] The second point is earnestly believe that I matter to God.
[time=2572] And that becomes perhaps more difficult for some of us than even believing there is a God, is believing that I matter to Him.
[time=2581] You see, all of us at all times are constantly evaluating ourselves and comparing ourselves.
[time=2590] Last week was the NFL draft and once again, I wasn't picked.
[time=2596] It was very disappointing.
[time=2601] And we watched ESPN as they went through months of telling us who will be the number one picked
[time=2608] quarterback, who will be the first taken lineman.
[time=2611] And everybody was given points and who ran the fastest 40.
[time=2615] And everybody was being compared.
[time=2617] Here are the first round picks, here are the second round picks, here are the wannabe picks,
[time=2623] here are the couch potatoes, and we know who's where in this continuum.
[time=2630] And the same thing happens.
[time=2633] You go to school, somebody is the vowel dictorian, somebody is the salutatorian, somebody is
[time=2641] get out of the auditorium, I did so well in the third grade.
[time=2650] They asked me to stay back and help the next group of kids through.
[time=2655] And so I know where I'm at on this academic continuum.
[time=2660] I'm the guy making it possible for somebody to be that vowel dictorian.
[time=2667] You turn on the television set and they give awards.
[time=2672] This is the best actor, this is the best actress, this is the best supporting actor, this is the best supporting actress, and everything is compared.
[time=2683] You go to work.
[time=2684] You know that your work's being evaluated.
[time=2686] You know that you're being compared.
[time=2689] And deeper than all of that, you and I know we are being morally evaluated.
[time=2697] We know there is a right and a wrong.
[time=2700] We know that we have this deep emotion called guilt.
[time=2711] And guilt leads to shame.
[time=2715] And when we think about our guilt and shame, our instincts are to do the exact same things that Adam and Eve did, that is to back up, to turn and to hide and hope that God doesn't
[time=2728] see me.
[time=2733] The good news is God cares deeply about you.
[time=2739] You don't need to hide.
[time=2741] He loves you and you matter to him.
[time=2747] We tend to think that there are all these good people and over here you've got Billy Graham and people like Mother Teresa and I'm somewhere south of them.
[time=2758] There was a woman who had so much guilt and so much shame.
[time=2762] Five marriages.
[time=2764] We don't know whether she was divorced, a widow, abandoned, probably a little bit above
[time=2772] when you had five.
[time=2773] She was now living with a man and her shame was so great that she could not bear to hear
[time=2780] the whispers of the other women when they came to the city well to draw water.
[time=2787] You came in the cool of the morning before it became scorching hundred degree temperatures at noon but not her.
[time=2795] She came at noon with the hope and the security that no one else would be at the well.
[time=2802] And then when she thought she had a safe, private moment to draw her water, Jesus walked up
[time=2809] and he asked for a drink.
[time=2812] She was shocked.
[time=2814] Her words were, "Why would you speak to me?
[time=2817] You must be new in town because if you knew who I was, you wouldn't talk to me."
[time=2826] And Jesus intentionally wanted to talk to her.
[time=2831] She mattered to him.
[time=2835] Please don't think that the Bible has good people and bad people.
[time=2841] The Bible only has people who need Jesus.
[time=2845] Even the ones that we look at as great people and maybe they were great compared to me.
[time=2851] They had their failures, their faults and their flaws.
[time=2856] You think of Noah.
[time=2857] Noah was great.
[time=2858] He had the faith to believe that it would rain so hard the world would be flooded.
[time=2864] And then he said, "By the way God, what's rain?" He had great faith but he also had a drinking problem.
[time=2872] I mean a fall down, don't know where your pants are kind of drinking problem.
[time=2882] Abraham was a great man.
[time=2884] By faith he followed God from the land of Ur of Khaldis to a place he didn't even know existed.
[time=2890] But he was also a deadbeat dad.
[time=2894] He wanted a son.
[time=2896] God promised him a son.
[time=2897] He's now very, very old and he has no son.
[time=2900] So he says, "God's plan's not working, I'll come up with a plan." And he takes a mistress.
[time=2907] Her name's Hagar.
[time=2909] She has a son named Ishmael.
[time=2913] Being lo and behold, his wife does have a son named Isaac.
[time=2918] Now he's got two women, two sons and too many problems.
[time=2927] So he goes to Hagar and Ishmael and says, "Go."
[time=2933] Just go.
[time=2936] No, here's your half of the estate.
[time=2938] No, here's your child's support.
[time=2941] So here's joint custody.
[time=2945] Just go.
[time=2948] David is described in the book of Acts as a man after God's own heart and he was.
[time=2954] But he was also a politician with more sex scandals than anybody you know of.
[time=2960] I mean, this guy had multiple wives, mistresses, affairs.
[time=2969] And this son born to that woman, get along with this son born to that woman and this son like that half sister and raped her.
[time=2979] And then her full brother went over and killed that son and David's family became so torn up over his scandalous behavior that one of his sons deposed him as king.
[time=2990] Now this isn't beat up on the old guy's day.
[time=2994] This is please know that no matter who you are or what you've done, you matter to God.
[time=3008] God knows all about my situation.
[time=3015] God knows where your next paycheck's going to come from.
[time=3019] He knows how you're going to make your next car payment.
[time=3022] He knows how long your plant's going to stay open.
[time=3026] He knows who's going to get laid off and who's not.
[time=3030] God knows who you're going to marry.
[time=3033] God knows where he or she is at at this very moment.
[time=3036] God knows how you're going to bump into each other.
[time=3041] God has that all planned.
[time=3043] He knows your situation.
[time=3046] Notice how Jesus put it, "are not two sparrows sold for a penny, yet not one of them will
[time=3053] fall to the ground apart from the will of your father." Do you ever notice when birds migrate sometimes you look up and there's just thousands of
[time=3063] birds going whoosh, and you wonder how do they all move and could you imagine why they're
[time=3069] moving trying to count them?
[time=3070] One, two, three, four.
[time=3071] Hold still.
[time=3072] Five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[time=3073] He stands still. God has no trouble keeping track of every one of them.
[time=3078] And then Jesus added, "Even the number of hairs on your head are numbered.
[time=3085] They're known by God." I don't know how many hairs are on the top of my head.
[time=3091] I notice there's more and more in my hairbrush, but on top of my head I don't have a count, but Jesus does.
[time=3098] He knows you that well.
[time=3100] He knows you by name, and he knows you by need.
[time=3105] He not only knows your situation.
[time=3109] He cares about your situation.
[time=3114] God cares about my situation.
[time=3118] Here's Psalm 103, verse 13, "The Lord is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate
[time=3128] to those who fear him.
[time=3130] For he understands how weak we are, he knows that we are only dust."
[time=3138] Peter invites us, "Cast all your worries, all of your cares on him, for he cares what
[time=3147] happens to you." The final point is this, earnestly believe that God has the power to change my situation.
[time=3163] It's great to believe that God exists.
[time=3168] It's great to believe God cares about me.
[time=3172] But what ultimately matters is believing he has the power to change your life.
[time=3180] If you have a father wound, your dad was a debt bead dad, or your dad was there but
[time=3189] never gave you affirmation, approval or affection, and you're carrying that father wound through
[time=3195] life, God can heal that.
[time=3199] He can step in and fill the hole and be the heavenly father that you didn't have in an
[time=3205] earthly father.
[time=3208] If your wound is, you've been overly bonded with your mother.
[time=3212] And you don't know how to stand up to your mom and say, "Mom, I love you, but I'm married,
[time=3218] I have my own kids, and we're going to spend Christmas as a family.
[time=3224] We'll drop by and visit you, but we're not coming to your house on your schedule to
[time=3231] do everything the way we did it when I was a little boy, I'm now a big boy."
[time=3238] If you don't have that ability to cut those apron strings, God will give you that ability.
[time=3246] If you have found that it is easier to drink alcohol than to face reality, God will give
[time=3255] you the ability to overcome the alcohol addiction and to face reality.
[time=3262] God wants to do in your life what God did in arts life, and that is to take a man who
[time=3268] was addicted to things that controlled him and not only set him free from that addiction,
[time=3274] but to raise him up as a spiritual leader.
[time=3278] Now as you embark in this particular ministry called Celebrate Recovery, this has to be
[time=3285] a grassroots movement.
[time=3289] There are some things that pastors can dream up, like somebody dreamed up Saturday night
[time=3296] church, and we've done that and it's worked.
[time=3300] But a pastor cannot dream up Celebrate Recovery.
[time=3304] Celebrate Recovery has to have people in it who have overcome addictions, hurts, habits
[time=3311] and hang-ups, and Celebrate Recovery has to have people who say, "I believe in the transformational
[time=3318] power of Jesus Christ so much, I'm going to invite my friends."
[time=3324] I go to Celebrate Recovery quite often at the chapel, sometimes I just need the encouragement,
[time=3330] but if I see a man who needs it, I don't say, "Hey, you ought to go on Monday night."
[time=3336] I say, "I will go this Monday night, I will be there to introduce you."
[time=3342] You can't say to somebody who feels like their life is a mess, they have no help, and they have no hope, and just say, "Hey, go to Blackhawk Friday night.
[time=3352] Somebody there will help you." It's going to take this body of people saying, "We want to be the church to those who need Jesus the most." And Celebrate Recovery begins here at Blackhawk on Friday night.
[time=3368] There's a brochure in the lobby if you want all of the details, but it's going to be Friday night here in the South Campus at 7 o'clock.
[time=3375] It will begin with a worship and a teaching time and a testimony, then there will be gender specific groups where if your issue is dealing with pornography, there'll be a support group
[time=3387] for that.
[time=3387] If yours is alcohol, there'll be a support group for that.
[time=3397] Help is available in Jesus Christ.
[time=3402] Would you today come to the second step and say, "I earnestly believe that God exists
[time=3410] and that I matter to Him and He has the power to change my life?
[time=3417] Let's pray." At this moment, if you've never given your life to Christ, I hope that you will personally
[time=3435] say the following things to Him, in your own words and in your own ways, "Jesus, I believe
[time=3444] your God.
[time=3450] Forgive me for thinking I was God of even this life that I call mine.
[time=3459] And Jesus, I need help and I need hope.
[time=3466] Please forgive me of my failures and my flaws and my sins.
[time=3474] Please come into my life.
[time=3478] It is yours.
[time=3480] [AMEN - 24 seconds]
[time=3534] You
