[time=607] (audience applauds)
[time=613] - My name is Dorothy Reed.
[time=615] I am the mother of Kathy and Mark.
[time=620] I am the grandmother of Colin, Lauren, Haley, Jack and Ava.
[time=625] I'm Joyce Fall and I raise two children, a son and a daughter, Kathy Murs and Greg Chaffin.
[time=635] I have four grandchildren, Jeffrey, Katie, Molly and Annie.
[time=641] And I actually came to Fort Wayne for my grandchildren.
[time=644] - I am Katherine Moore, seven children, Kay, Christine, Kent Keith, Connie Kim, Cozette Dawn, Kevin Samuel and Candy Joy.
[time=658] Also, I have 27 grandchildren and five great grandchildren, which we love dearly.
[time=666] - I'm Mary Ann Gibson and we have two children, Timothy James and Natalie May and Timothy and his wife have three grown daughters, Samantha Rebecca and Elizabeth and our daughter, Natalie and her husband, Brad, have two grown sons, David and John.
[time=683] - I would tell any young mother to seek God's guidance
[time=696] every day to teach by example, to be an encouragement, to support, to nourish body and soul, listen.
[time=711] And most of all, relax and enjoy being a mother.
[time=716] And a scripture that has been very helpful for me is Proverbs 22, verse six.
[time=724] Train a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not turn from it.
[time=731] - A word of encouragement that I might think of for our young moms would be to love your children, of course.
[time=738] And I'm sure that would be every grandmother or mother's first advice is to really love your children.
[time=743] But I started really understanding love for my children as well as others.
[time=749] When I was a little older, I wasn't a really young mom.
[time=752] My daughter actually accepted Christ before I did.
[time=755] She was five years old in a Sunday school class.
[time=758] And at about that age, I came to the Lord and I found that loving was a lot more than just the hugs and kisses, which comes very naturally for me because I just am a demonstrative kind of person.
[time=773] But there's a scripture in Deuteronomy that I just loved hearing again because I was in a children's class and hearing those little children learn that verse reminded me of how important it is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength.
[time=791] It's in Deuteronomy 6.5.
[time=793] And to hear those little ones saying that was a reminder to me that that's the way a mom finds her way to being the kind of mom she really wants to be the very best.
[time=803] And the Lord gives us that example in his word.
[time=806] So just stay in that word and keep looking at those moms that are doing it right.
[time=811] And you'll be satisfied later on that you can find out that the one-on-one with your children while you walk along the way, whatever you're doing, whether you're driving to school or maybe to church or just home washing the dishes, you'll have opportunities to share that Lord that loves you so much.
[time=829] - Every day is a gift from God.
[time=831] And we have a choice to make.
[time=833] We can either make that choice and be an anxious and worried about all the problems of the day or we can just trust Jesus to help us with our problems.
[time=844] And he has said, acknowledge him in all of our ways and he will direct our past.
[time=850] - Many years ago when I was a young mother and older mother shared this with our group and it meant so much to me, I'd like to share it today.
[time=858] She said that we needed to do every chore that God has given us with a thankful heart.
[time=864] And I went home and thought about that.
[time=866] And the next thing I knew, I was thanking God for dirty diapers because it meant that God had given me a precious baby.
[time=874] And then as those two children grew and diapers were done, the homes seemed to never be clean, always dirty, loads of laundry to be washed, ironed and mended, three meals a day to be prepared and then cleaned up again.
[time=888] But I got to thinking without my children, I wouldn't have those chores, but oh Lord, thank you.
[time=896] And so when I got tired and I got weary and I did, just like everybody else, I would stop and literally thank the Lord for the chore that I was doing because it represented my children and my husband.
[time=909] And I also thank the Lord that I had money to have food to cook and close to wash in a home to have.
[time=916] And when I got really weary, God laid a verse on my heart, Galatians 6-9, and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.
[time=929] So the well doing of taking care of my family, I tried to do with a thankful heart to serve the Lord by serving my family and it resulted in joy.
[time=940] - You know, just a side note here before we jump in, I got to say this to you.
[time=945] As I watched the video this morning with the moms on the screen, those dear women who have seen a lot of life and were so willing to come and graciously share a bit with us on tape, it just reminded me that I go back to a conversation I had with a young married couple about four or five months ago and this young married couple was asking me where they should go on a Sunday morning.
[time=968] They said it doesn't seem like you've got anything for young marrieds and while I would say to you that I think there are some benefits in young marrieds being with young marrieds, I understand that.
[time=978] I'll tell you what I told that couple.
[time=980] There's about three or four classes down the hall.
[time=983] They're all made up of old people.
[time=985] They're all like, I gotta be careful here, 55 and over.
[time=989] (audience laughs) I had a great bunch of people down that hall.
[time=993] I told this young couple, 50, 55 and over.
[time=996] Some married 20, 30, 40, 50 years.
[time=1000] They've all been in debt and got out.
[time=1004] They've all raised kids and made huge mistakes and learned from them.
[time=1008] They've all faced enormous challenges in life, the loss of loved ones, the loss of kids, the loss of a spouse and they're still here.
[time=1016] They're still walking with God.
[time=1018] They still love the Lord.
[time=1020] They're still a part of a local family.
[time=1022] They haven't turned into consumers.
[time=1024] They're just here to give themselves freely and often.
[time=1027] They're a great bunch of people and they're in the Excel class and they're in the Quynania class and they're in the Discovery class.
[time=1035] And if I were a young married doing it all over again, I'd beanline it for some 65 year old and I'd sit right next to 'em and I'd learn how to live.
[time=1045] And I'd listen to them as they talked about the mistakes they'd made and the life they've lived.
[time=1051] I can't tell you how blessed we are, my friends.
[time=1053] You're thinking about starting a small group?
[time=1055] I think you should.
[time=1056] Get a bunch of your friends together and then go find some old people.
[time=1059] Some old wise people, some old loving, gracious people, some older folks who have seen more life than you and invite them to meet with you on a regular basis and glean from them all that there is to glean.
[time=1072] What a gift we have in our senior adults and I would encourage you as it relates to those classes.
[time=1079] I just mentioned, they can point you in that direction this morning, go out to the guest center, dialogue class, Excel, Quynania, Discovery, there may be some others but I'll tell you what, it's an opportunity for anybody, 18, 20, 30 years old, give it a shot.
[time=1101] Well, I invite you this morning to week three in our series that we've entitled The Road to Recovery this morning, we've entitled The Message, Letting Go.
[time=1110] And I want to talk to you here at the outset about what happens when you and I allow sin and patterns of sin to go unchecked in our lives.
[time=1121] When sin is left unchecked, lead you and I to having a tendency to get stuck in life.
[time=1130] We get stuck in unhealthy bad relationships.
[time=1134] Maybe somebody here in the room can identify it with that.
[time=1137] We get stuck in hurtful habits.
[time=1140] We get stuck in grief.
[time=1142] When we lose a loved one, we get stuck in anger.
[time=1146] When a spouse mistreats us over the years, we get stuck in our work.
[time=1151] We get stuck in illicit relationships.
[time=1153] We get stuck in sin's grip when sin goes unchecked.
[time=1159] And here's the scary thing.
[time=1160] The further and further in you get, the harder and harder it becomes to get out.
[time=1166] And what happens then is after it gets harder and harder and harder to get out, you realize you're in a cycle.
[time=1174] Once you're stuck, there's this cycle that begins and you start feeling initially, you start feeling guilty when you're in this cycle.
[time=1181] Incredibly guilty that you're stuck.
[time=1183] You say, I shouldn't be here.
[time=1185] I know I shouldn't be here.
[time=1188] I wish I could get out of this, but I can't.
[time=1190] And then comes anger, guilt turns into anger, and you cry out, I should be able to change this.
[time=1197] Talk on it, I should be able to do something to get me out of this, but I can't.
[time=1203] You get mad at yourself that it doesn't get fixed.
[time=1208] And then your anger turns into fear.
[time=1211] From guilt to anger to fear.
[time=1213] To fear that you're never going to get unstuck.
[time=1218] You realize it's got control of you.
[time=1220] You begin to fear that you're going to end up dead or alone or ruined.
[time=1224] And then your fear eventually turns to depression and you start shutting down and withdrawing, feeling sorry for yourself.
[time=1231] And then you just resign yourself to the inevitable, which is at the bottom of the cycle and it's where you just quit.
[time=1238] And you just throw your hands up and say, that's it.
[time=1242] I'm done, I give up, I can't change.
[time=1246] And then you start the cycle all over again.
[time=1249] So our question is, how do we break out, my friends?
[time=1257] How does one break out of this stuckness?
[time=1261] How do we get out of these damaging and destructive patterns of sin?
[time=1265] That's what we've been talking about these last two weeks.
[time=1268] I'm so thankful for Rick Hawks, who was here last week.
[time=1271] So thankful that he was willing to continue on in our study.
[time=1275] It was a gift and a joy to be able to be at the chapel.
[time=1279] I was so grateful for the many people I met.
[time=1281] And yet I have to admit it's good to be home and good to be with all of you this morning.
[time=1286] We saw a couple of weeks ago, step one, step one in this road to recovery, admit I've got a problem, realize that I'm powerless, I realize that I'm not God.
[time=1297] We have to come to this place, my friends, where we realize that we are in our humanness absolutely and utterly powerless to change anything significant, anything substantial about us.
[time=1311] I realize the are in recovery, I realize I'm not God.
[time=1315] And secondly, not only am I powerless, not only am I not God,
[time=1321] but I earnestly believe God exists, the e there in earnestly is the e in recovery.
[time=1326] I earnestly believe God exists and that God has the power and is willing to rescue me.
[time=1334] I declare this because the word of God declares this.
[time=1337] I declare this because he knows my problems.
[time=1341] He's intimately acquainted with everything that I encounter and he cares about me.
[time=1346] The God of the universe cares about me.
[time=1349] The God of the universe wants to help me.
[time=1352] He wants to rescue me, he can redeem me.
[time=1354] But it's not just enough, listen, here we go.
[time=1359] It's not just enough to know that God can redeem me and God can rescue me and God can heal me.
[time=1365] The scriptures clearly indicate that there's a choice that you and I have to make.
[time=1369] There's a line that we have to walk across.
[time=1372] There's decisions that you and I have to engage in.
[time=1375] Step three, here it comes.
[time=1376] In light of one and two, I consciously then, I consciously choose to commit all of my life and will to Christ's care and control.
[time=1390] Now, watch this, a lot of you in the room, just like right now, when I read that to you, you're right on the verge of maybe tuning out.
[time=1401] There are a lot of you in the room who just read that on the screen and thought, okay, I see where this is going, this obviously isn't for me, I've already done that.
[time=1411] And I want to say this to you this morning, have you?
[time=1420] Really, have you?
[time=1423] Have you truly, genuinely, deeply committed,
[time=1430] or I like the word submitted?
[time=1434] Have you submitted yourself completely and absolutely in every arena of your life, in every area of weakness, in every relationship, in every endeavor, have you taken your entire life and have you really submitted it to the control and care, to the lordship and salvation that Christ and Christ alone provides?
[time=1458] This is our third step.
[time=1461] And for some in the room this morning, you're sitting here in your mind as I'm asking you this, just say, no, I haven't, and you're just being real upfront and real honest, and I'm so thankful that you're upfront and honest and we're so thankful that you're here.
[time=1472] This could be a significant day in your life.
[time=1476] For others of you, I just don't want you to tune out.
[time=1479] I think there may be some things here for you, even though maybe you raised a hand, even though maybe you walked an aisle at some point in time, even though you maybe prayed a prayer.
[time=1488] I wonder as we make our way through this this morning, if there might be for you some opportunities to re-clarify some things, to re-establish or maybe even restate some things.
[time=1501] I consciously choose to commit all of my life and will to Christ's care and control.
[time=1508] This third step is based on what Jesus said in Matthew 11, 28 to 30, where He said, come to me, all who are weary and overburdened, all who are weary and the text says heavy laden.
[time=1521] And Jesus says, I will give you what?
[time=1523] Say it if you know it.
[time=1524] Rest, I'll give you rest.
[time=1527] He says, take my yoke upon you.
[time=1529] Jesus said, my yoke, my yoke is His teaching.
[time=1532] My yoke, that means His way.
[time=1535] What He stands for, Jesus says, take my yoke upon you and learn from me.
[time=1539] For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[time=1542] Jesus says, come to me and you will find rest.
[time=1546] It's God's invitation.
[time=1548] God's saying, through Jesus Christ, I will unstick you from sin's power.
[time=1556] Give me control and care of your life
[time=1562] and watch what I will do.
[time=1565] I will change you.
[time=1566] I will transform you.
[time=1568] I will redeem you.
[time=1570] Matthew 11, I will give you rest.
[time=1572] So here's my question.
[time=1574] Here's my question to some of you in the room this morning who I know this applies to.
[time=1580] Others of you watching via the broadcast this morning.
[time=1584] And I'm so grateful many of you interact with me.
[time=1587] You send me emails.
[time=1588] I'm in ongoing conversations right now with people who watch on the broadcast.
[time=1594] And I know there are many of you.
[time=1596] And this question I'm about to ask applies to you.
[time=1600] And the question is this.
[time=1602] Why won't you accept the offer?
[time=1606] What keeps you from taking this third step?
[time=1611] Why to this day do you refuse to commit or submit all of your life to the care and control of our Lord?
[time=1621] What keeps people from taking this third step?
[time=1624] I wanna just engage you in that conversation this morning, get you to think that through with me.
[time=1629] God's word has a lot to say about this.
[time=1632] And I hope it will be helpful.
[time=1633] What keeps people from doing this number one, you can write it down on your notes sheet there, pride.
[time=1638] Pride is what is keeping many people from bowing the knee of their heart and fully surrendering their hearts and lives to the care and control of Christ.
[time=1646] Pride will keep me from admitting I need help.
[time=1650] Proverbs 18, 12.
[time=1651] Before destruction, the heart of man is haughty.
[time=1654] Proverbs 18, 12 and the NASB.
[time=1657] Before destruction, the heart of man is haughty, but humility goes before honor.
[time=1663] One translation says it this way.
[time=1665] Arrogant people are on the way to ruin because they won't admit it when they need help.
[time=1672] It's true.
[time=1673] How many men won't stop and ask for directions?
[time=1678] It's just a little Mother's Day jab at the guys there.
[time=1681] Just for fun.
[time=1683] Why won't so many of us?
[time=1684] Seriously.
[time=1685] Why won't so many of us who are stuck in patterns of sin and addiction, not just ask for help.
[time=1694] Why won't we cry out for help?
[time=1696] Why won't we get on our knees and bury our faces in the ground and cry, oh God, please help me.
[time=1703] Where's the desperation that should be there in people like you and me who are as stuck as people like you and me?
[time=1713] Why won't we cry out?
[time=1714] I'm a mess and I'm stuck in my mess.
[time=1717] A lot of times we won't just because we're arrogant
[time=1724] 'cause we don't wanna look bad and we don't want people to see and understand what's really transpiring.
[time=1732] And I'll just say this to you before we move on to number two.
[time=1735] If that's you this morning, I'll just remind you of what God's word reminds us of again and again and again, that pride cometh before the fall.
[time=1746] Pride, you can write it down.
[time=1747] Pride leads to pain and he will get your attention.
[time=1752] If you choose pride, if you choose arrogance
[time=1758] and you walk away from it today, he will continue to pursue you and your pride and my pride always leads to pain.
[time=1767] Sometimes it's that pride that keeps us from this third step.
[time=1770] Number two, guilt.
[time=1772] Guilt will keep you from taking this step.
[time=1775] You think like I think at times, I'm ashamed.
[time=1779] I'm ashamed to ask God to help me.
[time=1782] Psalm 4012, Psalm 4012 says in the NASB it says,
[time=1791] for evils beyond number have surrounded me.
[time=1795] My iniquities have overtaken me so that I am not able to see.
[time=1802] They are more numerous than the hairs of my head, my iniquities than my heart has failed me.
[time=1807] One translation reads problems far too big for me to solve are piled higher than my head.
[time=1814] Meanwhile, my sins too many to count have caught up with me and I'm ashamed to even look up.
[time=1822] Ever felt that way?
[time=1824] Anybody want to raise a hand?
[time=1830] Ever felt that way?
[time=1831] Yeah, I ever just felt so ashamed again
[time=1837] that you don't even want to look up.
[time=1839] I think about my kids.
[time=1840] Maybe you think about your kids.
[time=1842] I think I can remember even being a kid and doing this.
[time=1846] I think about my kids and when we get into certain situations and because of a certain series of events, lo and behold, they're busted.
[time=1857] They've been found out, whatever they did or said, it's come to my attention or my wife's.
[time=1863] And so there you are in the kitchen or there you are in the room or there you are in the backyard and you're having that conversation in the moment.
[time=1869] They usually try a couple of lobs across the bow to see if they can kind of maybe find a way out of this thing.
[time=1875] And then when they realize that they're not going anywhere and they realize you're not going anywhere and they realize that it's over, their eyes go where?
[time=1883] Down.
[time=1885] Our eyes go in our shame and our guilt, our eyes go down.
[time=1889] And so many people get so stuck.
[time=1894] So many people get so weary of the mistake.
[time=1898] So many people are so tired of their sin that their eyes just get stuck down and hear the Scriptures call for us to lift our heads.
[time=1909] And you say to me, you say, "Well, Kelly, "I'm too embarrassed to ask God for help.
[time=1913] "You don't know all the things I've done wrong." Well, you know what?
[time=1917] You don't know how many times,
[time=1923] you have no idea how many times I've begged God, me, how I've begged God for help, struck a deal with him, made a promise.
[time=1936] And broken that promise.
[time=1937] Again and again and again.
[time=1942] And I'm here to tell you, as you say to me,
[time=1948] you have no idea, you have no idea what I've done.
[time=1952] You have no idea, Kelly, how many times I've done it.
[time=1954] There's no way I can go to God for help.
[time=1956] And I'm here to tell you, you're dead wrong.
[time=1960] You're absolutely wrong and that's a lie from the enemy.
[time=1964] And there isn't any sin and there isn't any pattern of sin that God won't forgive.
[time=1971] If there isn't any place you can go, there's nothing you can do that he won't graciously reach in and make right, purify and forgive and bring hope.
[time=1981] He wants to listen, he God, no matter what you got taught
[time=1987] about him, no matter what view or image you have of him, the God of the universe wants to help you.
[time=1994] He wants to forgive you, he wants to lift you up.
[time=1997] He wants your head up, he wants you looking at him.
[time=2000] He wants to bring back to your life the confidence and love that comes when one knows and senses and realizes that they're deeply loved.
[time=2008] Don't let pride my friends or guilt keep you from taking this step.
[time=2013] He wants to forgive you.
[time=2014] What keeps you from committing all of your life to Christ's care and control number three fear?
[time=2022] This is really true, I talk to people all the time and in the midst of that conversation, I realize what's keeping them from doing this is they're afraid of what he's gonna ask them to give what?
[time=2030] To give up?
[time=2031] People don't wanna give up stuff.
[time=2035] Reminds me of that story, yeah, I know you've heard it a hundred times, a guy falls off the cliff, a thousand foot cliff, a guy falls off the cliff, halfway down, 500 foot mark, there's this branch sticking out, he grabs it, branch catches him, he's just hanging there by this branch, he's gonna break it, he meant it.
[time=2050] But he's hanging on this branch and he's just yelling at the top of his lungs, "Somebody help me, help me!" And here's this voice and it's God.
[time=2060] And God says to him, God says, "This is the Lord, trust me, let go and I'll catch you." And the guy's hanging there and he looks down at the next 500 feet and he looks up and he says, "Anybody else up there?" (congregation laughing) You've heard the story and it's sort of funny but it's also really, really sad and true of you and I.
[time=2082] So many times, hang in there by the branch, hang in there just absolutely on the brink, hang in there in an absolute mess and he's saying, "Let go, you're gonna have to trust me here." And there you are, hanging by that branch going, and I don't think so, I'll pass.
[time=2102] I'm okay, really, I'm glad I think I'm gonna survive, really, really, afraid to let go.
[time=2113] Afraid to let go, some of you are hanging on for dear life.
[time=2117] Why are you so afraid to commit your life to Christ?
[time=2123] Some say this to me, when I talk with them about this, some will say, "You know what, Kelly?
[time=2129] "I'll just be honest with you.
[time=2130] "I don't want, they don't like that word control." And they say, "I don't want anybody controlling me.
[time=2135] "I will not be controlled," they say.
[time=2137] And I laugh at him.
[time=2139] I say, "Dude, wake up.
[time=2141] "You're controlled every day of your life by something.
[time=2146] "Something's gonna control you.
[time=2149] "You are not going to, in any way, shape or form, "live life without being controlled.
[time=2155] "You're controlled by the opinions of other people.
[time=2158] "I see it all the time.
[time=2160] "You're controlled by the burden of that last purchase.
[time=2164] "I see it all the time.
[time=2165] "You're controlled by hurts that you can't forget.
[time=2168] "You're controlled by habits and hang ups.
[time=2171] "You're controlled by the way your parents brought you up.
[time=2173] "You're controlled by the pressure of peers.
[time=2176] "And by peer pressure, I don't just mean 16-year-olds.
[time=2179] "I'm learning as I get older.
[time=2181] "46-year-olds face that as well, trying to keep up,
[time=2187] "trying to compete, trying to look better than, "trying to have more than." You know what freedom is?
[time=2195] I love this.
[time=2196] I had to write it down for you.
[time=2197] It's on the screen.
[time=2198] You know what freedom is?
[time=2199] Freedom is choosing who controls you.
[time=2201] Do you understand this?
[time=2203] We have choices that we get to make.
[time=2204] And freedom is choosing who gets to control you.
[time=2208] When you surrender your life to Christ, his control.
[time=2212] See, it's a good word.
[time=2214] Set you free.
[time=2215] He said it himself in John 832, referring to himself as the truth.
[time=2219] He says, "You will know the truth and the truth "will set you what?" Free.
[time=2225] I, Jesus says, "I will set you free." Real freedom is choosing who your master will be.
[time=2231] So what are you afraid of?
[time=2234] Some of you are holding on to that ambition.
[time=2240] Some of you are holding on to that lifestyle that you just started to be able to live.
[time=2247] Some of you are holding on to the dreams that you have.
[time=2253] But I say to you today, what about the dreams that he has for you?
[time=2257] What about what he has planned for you?
[time=2260] We'll talk about that in just a moment.
[time=2262] Don't be fearful.
[time=2266] The Lord's control brings peace and blessing and hope.
[time=2272] Number four, write this down, worry.
[time=2273] Sometimes people refuse to take this third step in recovery because of worry.
[time=2279] Worry keeps you from surrendering your life to the care and control of Christ.
[time=2284] And here's often how it plays out.
[time=2286] How the person sits there thinking this thing through and they're just wracked with anxiety and worry.
[time=2293] They say, "How will it play out for me?
[time=2295] "What's going to happen if I really choose Christ?
[time=2299] "What if I choose Christ and I falter?
[time=2301] "What if I mess this up, Kelly?
[time=2303] "I've messed everything else up in my life.
[time=2306] "Why wouldn't I mess this up?
[time=2308] "I have no idea where this is gonna go.
[time=2310] "I have no idea what he's got in store.
[time=2312] "I just don't know if I can do it." We confuse decision-making because we gotta make a decision.
[time=2321] We confuse decision-making, watch this, with problem-solving.
[time=2327] This is something I've been learning in my own life
[time=2333] in recent days.
[time=2334] Back in 1963, I don't remember it.
[time=2338] I was born then, if you remember it, then you're older than me.
[time=2342] Back in 1963, John F. Kennedy publicly announced, some of you in the room maybe remember, we're gonna put a man on the moon by the end of the decade.
[time=2351] J.F.K. said that, 1963.
[time=2353] That was his decision.
[time=2355] Now, had all the problems been solved?
[time=2359] That came with putting a man on the moon when he made that decision?
[time=2363] Yes or no?
[time=2364] No.
[time=2365] No, but if you're a good leader, you know you never confuse decision-making with problem-solving because if you do, oftentimes you end up never making anyone.
[time=2375] Right.
[time=2377] Not a good thing.
[time=2379] You have to make the decision, then solve the problems.
[time=2385] Kennedy said, "We're gonna go to the moon." And then it was NASA's job to face the problems and figure out the solutions.
[time=2392] Don't worry.
[time=2398] I mean, there's gonna be stuff to deal with and there's gonna be stuff to face but you make the decision.
[time=2402] And in time, God graciously, lovingly with great purpose, helps you work toward a solution because he cares about you.
[time=2412] Write it down.
[time=2413] First Peter, five, seven.
[time=2414] Cast all.
[time=2415] Cast all your, cast all your anxiety.
[time=2419] Cast all of your care on him.
[time=2423] I love what it says in my Bible.
[time=2426] I was reading it this week on that first Peter, five, seven.
[time=2430] Let me read this to you.
[time=2433] Cast all your anxiety on him.
[time=2436] This verse, is that on the screen there?
[time=2437] There it is.
[time=2438] Listen to this.
[time=2439] This verse partly quotes and partly interprets Psalm 55, 22.
[time=2444] Casting.
[time=2445] Casting all your cares.
[time=2447] Casting means to throw something on something.
[time=2452] As to throw a blanket on a donkey, Luke 19.
[time=2455] Followers of Christ are to cast all of their discontent.
[time=2461] All of their discouragement.
[time=2464] All of their despair and suffering on the Lord and trust him for knowing what he's doing with their lives.
[time=2472] Isn't that great?
[time=2474] The whole idea is that we are to put on him that which we cannot manage and that which we cannot control.
[time=2483] I want you to remember this.
[time=2484] It might be the most important thing I say all morning.
[time=2486] The Christian life is a decision followed by a process.
[time=2491] Do you understand this?
[time=2493] The Christian life is a decision followed by a process, a process called sanctification.
[time=2497] It's a painful process.
[time=2499] It's a joyful process.
[time=2501] It's a process filled with ups and downs, filled with victories and defeats.
[time=2507] It's filled with progress and regress.
[time=2510] It was fascinating.
[time=2512] It was really cool this week to read about this in World War II.
[time=2516] The Marines had a definite strategy that they used in the Pacific when they went to retake the Pacific from the Japanese.
[time=2526] They used the same strategy on every island and it worked every time.
[time=2531] First the Marines would go to the island that had been taken captive and start bombing it.
[time=2535] They just pelt it with bombs and grenades and all kinds of explosives.
[time=2540] This was called the softening up period.
[time=2543] Softening up period, you might be.
[time=2546] You might be in the softening up period.
[time=2551] God may be the spirit of God may be softening your heart.
[time=2556] As he seeks to bring to your life the caring control
[time=2562] that only he can bring.
[time=2565] In the second phase, the Marines would come in and establish a beachhead.
[time=2570] Do you understand this word, beachhead?
[time=2572] Maybe only 28, they'd land and they'd kind of take the beach
[time=2578] but not like even all the beach, just part of the beach, maybe 20 yards deep and 200 yards wide.
[time=2584] But all they needed was to establish a presence on that beach, on that island.
[time=2592] Now, when they had established a presence, when they had a beachhead question, had they completely liberated the island at that point?
[time=2600] Yes or no?
[time=2601] No, they had just gotten in.
[time=2604] But from there they began to fight the battles.
[time=2606] Sometimes they'd move 100 yards forward and sometimes they'd move 100 yards back.
[time=2611] Sometimes they'd win the battle and sometimes they'd lose the battle.
[time=2614] But everybody knew that once they'd established a beachhead, once they had established a presence, liberation of the island was inevitable.
[time=2624] It was just a matter of what?
[time=2626] Time.
[time=2627] And in the history, this was so cool.
[time=2629] In the history of World War II, once the Marines had landed and established a beachhead, they never lost an island.
[time=2638] It was just a matter of time that the entire island would be set free.
[time=2643] For some of you, when you're willing, when you exercise the courage that I think you'll exercise this morning to take this third step, what's happening is that God's getting a beachhead, you with me, in your life.
[time=2659] Bible calls it conversion.
[time=2662] It means God establishes his divine, redemptive, sanctifying presence in your life.
[time=2669] Does this mean that everything now in your life will be perfect?
[time=2673] Absolutely not.
[time=2674] It means God's got a beachhead though, and for the rest of your life, he's going to be setting you free little by little, by little, battle, by battle, by battle.
[time=2684] It's a process, so don't worry.
[time=2687] Don't worry, and number five, don't doubt.
[time=2691] Sometimes people don't make this step.
[time=2696] Sometimes they walk away.
[time=2698] And I've had conversations with folks who have said, "I wanna believe, Kelly, I do, but my faith, "my faith just seems so small.
[time=2706] "How will I ever have?" They say a big enough faith to really succeed.
[time=2712] I mean, they say there's so much on the line there.
[time=2715] There's so much at stake, I don't know if I can do it.
[time=2718] And let me say this to you, it's the same thing I've said to them so many times in the past, it's not about the size of your faith.
[time=2729] This isn't about the size of your faith.
[time=2732] You can look at the Bible in Matthew 17, 20.
[time=2734] It says if you have faith as small as a what?
[time=2737] Small as a mustard seed.
[time=2739] There's the picture that Jesus uses.
[time=2741] It says if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, nothing will be impossible, nothing.
[time=2748] It's not the size, write this down.
[time=2751] It's not the size of your faith that matters.
[time=2754] It's the size of what you put your faith in.
[time=2757] Do you understand this?
[time=2759] Not heads, say amen.
[time=2761] Does that make sense?
[time=2763] This is the issue, the size of what you put your faith in.
[time=2768] It's about the size of your God.
[time=2771] And really it comes down to are you gonna put your faith in a little G God?
[time=2776] Are you going to when the chips are down?
[time=2779] Are you going to in the midst of your distress?
[time=2781] Are you going to in the midst of the patterns of your life?
[time=2785] Are we going to put our faith in a little G addiction?
[time=2790] A little G God that's really just an addiction.
[time=2792] You're gonna put your faith in a bottle, you're gonna put your faith in some drugs, you're gonna put your faith in some co-dependency, you're gonna put your faith in food, you're gonna put your faith in anger, you're gonna put your faith in approval?
[time=2805] That is a faith that will fail.
[time=2810] That faith won't come through.
[time=2813] And what we see here, what we see here is that faith in God, big G God, not little G fake God, no big G real authentic God who gives you and me his son, Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal life and meaningful life today.
[time=2833] That's what works.
[time=2834] That's where satisfaction and fullness of life is found.
[time=2838] I think about what's transpired on Wall Street in the last six to 12 months.
[time=2842] I think about the millions of people who put their faith in a bottom line.
[time=2846] How they doing today?
[time=2849] I hear story after story, after story of absolute devastation, lives utterly devastated because they put everything all their faith and all their hope.
[time=2863] A little faith, listen, a little mustard seed faith
[time=2870] in a big G-d brings huge returns.
[time=2877] And I just invite you this morning to look at all five.
[time=2880] You've got your note sheet there, look at all five of those things we just filled in.
[time=2883] Don't, I'm begging you today, don't let any of these things keep you from taking this third step.
[time=2889] Well, let me say this to you, what is the step?
[time=2894] How do you take the step?
[time=2895] Boy, I hope you're interested.
[time=2897] I bet there are some in the room this morning and some watching on the broadcast and you're absolutely interested, so here you go.
[time=2903] Will you just write these things down?
[time=2905] How do I take the step?
[time=2906] What does it mean to submit myself to the care and control of Christ?
[time=2911] Number one, I accept God's son as my savior.
[time=2913] Will you do that?
[time=2916] Will you come to the place where in your heart you believe Romans 10, 9 says that if you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, you will be saved.
[time=2928] Will you believe in your heart that God's son, Jesus Christ, is your savior and the only one that will save you?
[time=2940] That will save you, are you willing this morning to understand that your religion won't save you?
[time=2946] Being American won't save you.
[time=2948] Voting a certain way won't save you.
[time=2950] Your parents' belief doesn't save you.
[time=2953] Coming to this church doesn't save you.
[time=2955] The only thing that saves you is when you accept the sacrificial work of God's son on the cross on your behalf, when you accept that.
[time=2966] Jesus, as Lord and savior, care and control,
[time=2972] when you see your sin and your futile human efforts leaving you separated from a holy God, then and only then are you on the path to redemption.
[time=2983] Number one, accept God's son as your savior.
[time=2986] Number two, you accept God's word as your standard for living.
[time=2989] I accept God's word as my standard for living.
[time=2993] The Psalmist said that the scriptures are, Psalm 119.
[time=2997] The Psalmist said that the scriptures are a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[time=3002] He is the ultimate God and his word will be from this point on my ultimate source of authority and direction and guidance.
[time=3013] He writes it to reveal himself to me.
[time=3016] He writes it so I can understand not only him, but this way in which he wants me to live and think and function and value.
[time=3023] Now as you make this commitment to Christ's care and control, you willingly submit every part of your life to the word of God and its direction because it's through the word the Lord cares for and controls and leads and guides his people.
[time=3041] It's through the spirit of God that's energized in this word.
[time=3046] I accept God's son, accept God's word, I accept God's will.
[time=3050] I told you we'd get back to this number three.
[time=3052] I accept God's will.
[time=3054] This is very important that you not just say this, it's important that you desire this.
[time=3062] I accept God's will as the ultimate goal in my life.
[time=3066] This is heavy duty stuff.
[time=3067] Is this true of you?
[time=3070] That you look at God's will, what God wants for you, what God wants you to stay in, what according to this, what God wants you to give yourself to according to this, the way God wants you to value, the way God wants you to choose, the things God wants you to pursue, the things he doesn't want you to pursue.
[time=3090] Are you willing to look at God and the spirit of God and the word of God and say, you know what?
[time=3095] Whatever God wants, I'm gonna do.
[time=3098] I wanna be in the center, not the peripheral, I wanna be in the center of God's will for my life.
[time=3107] And I declare that there's no better place to be than in his will.
[time=3112] Can you say that?
[time=3113] Will you say that?
[time=3114] Number four, I accept God's power.
[time=3120] Philippians 4.13, I accept God's power.
[time=3123] God's power is my strength.
[time=3125] We win on this one, my friends.
[time=3128] This is a huge, this is a win-win for us.
[time=3131] Our futility and our weakness.
[time=3135] Now we come under the submission of the Lord and God's power now is our strength.
[time=3142] I can do everything.
[time=3143] I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
[time=3147] No longer do I have to rely on my own energy.
[time=3154] No longer do I have to rely on my own willpower, no longer am I relying on anything remotely connected to me.
[time=3163] I look at it this way, things work better plugged in.
[time=3165] Did we realize that?
[time=3166] Out in the garage, working on stuff, things just seem to work better when they're plugged in.
[time=3171] And I tell you what, when he establishes this beachhead, when you come to faith in Jesus Christ, we get plugged in to God and to his strength and to his energy, to his authority.
[time=3186] God says, I will give you my power to be all that I have called and designed you to be.
[time=3191] I wonder if you're ready this morning to make that commitment.
[time=3197] Let me leave you with a picture here.
[time=3199] It's a picture in the book of Revelation where it says, Jesus says, I stand at the door and knock.
[time=3207] I stand at the door and knock.
[time=3208] If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come where?
[time=3213] I will come in and fellowship with him.
[time=3216] Jesus says, I'm standing at the door of your life.
[time=3219] I'm knocking.
[time=3220] I wanna heal you.
[time=3223] I wanna redeem you.
[time=3225] I wanna give your life purpose.
[time=3227] I wanna begin to repair what's broken.
[time=3230] I wanna unstick you.
[time=3233] Will you submit all of your life and all of your heart to me?
[time=3238] And let me ask you if you would just bow your heads.
[time=3243] And close your eyes this morning.
[time=3245] And with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, I wanna just give you the opportunity.
[time=3249] You may be watching on TV.
[time=3252] You may be right here in this room this morning.
[time=3254] You may be listening online.
[time=3256] And I wanna just say to you that right now is as good a time as any.
[time=3263] Right now may be God's divinely appointed time for you to take this third step.
[time=3268] You know what, there's eight steps coming.
[time=3270] There's five more after this.
[time=3273] I looked at the material a couple of weeks ago.
[time=3275] I thought, man, three should be eight, but no, three is three.
[time=3278] And I can't wait for you to see what's coming.
[time=3280] But let me just, let me say this to you.
[time=3282] If you miss this step, the rest of it might be inspiring and the rest of it might be helpful and the rest of it might be encouraging, but the rest of it will never ever accomplish.
[time=3293] This road to recovery, this road to freedom, this road to repentance.
[time=3300] Unless you're willing at a point in time to knowingly and readily surrender all of you to the care and control of Christ Jesus.
[time=3312] Here's how you can do it.
[time=3314] You don't have to say it a certain way.
[time=3316] You don't necessarily have to pray it.
[time=3318] Although sometimes that's a great form, you know, within which for this declaration to take place.
[time=3326] But if you believe these words, I'm gonna just give you some words to just guide you through this.
[time=3332] If you believe this in your heart and if you're willing before God this morning to proclaim this to him as true from your heart, and he says he'll save you.
[time=3344] He says he'll redeem you.
[time=3346] And it just would go something like this, dear God in heaven.
[time=3349] I realize I am stuck in my sin.
[time=3355] Oh God, I realize that my sin separates me from you.
[time=3360] My sin, my patterns of sin, they separate me from relationship with you.
[time=3368] And oh God, I long to be in relationship with you.
[time=3371] You can just say this to him.
[time=3374] You can just say God, would you please forgive me for all of my sin?
[time=3379] I know it's a lot.
[time=3380] Would you forgive me and would you make me whole?
[time=3385] And as I enter into this relationship with your son, as I commit today to follow after Jesus, oh God, would you give me strength and courage?
[time=3395] God, would you grow me into the man or woman that you've called me to be?
[time=3401] Would you allow me to forget what lies behind and instead with your help, God, press forward to that which lies ahead?
[time=3409] Say to him, oh God, I'm so grateful.
[time=3413] God, I'm so thankful.
[time=3415] Words can express how appreciative I am for your grace and mercy.
[time=3422] This offer of forgiveness and this promise of life with you.
[time=3426] God, I commit today to walk with you.
[time=3431] I commit today to be fully devoted.
[time=3435] I know I'll need your help.
[time=3436] I know I'll need those in this church to come alongside and God, I'm grateful that they're here.
[time=3442] Thank you for saving me.
[time=3444] And God, we as a family, we marvel again every time we think those truths through.
[time=3451] We marvel that this morning, there are those who have said those words and believed those truths and have submitted themselves, God, to the care and control of your son.
[time=3462] And we commit as a family to walk alongside as best we can, to faithfully invest in them, to love them, to offer them the guidance and the encouragement that they'll need.
[time=3472] And oh God, we pray you'd give us the strength to do that very thing.
[time=3476] And all the people in the room agreed and said, amen.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
