[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] We're thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=36] If you've been watching the Bible Hour over these last several weeks, you know that we find ourselves in the midst of a very compelling series that we've entitled "The Road to Recovery." We're talking about and celebrating these days the process of recovery or repentance from the grip that sin can have in our lives, the destructive and deadly patterns of sin that oftentimes thwart what God has in store and what God desires for you and for me in our lives and in our relationship with Him.
[time=67] Today we come to step four in this "Road to Recovery" and it's a very, very important step and it has to do with you and I being willing to honestly and openly evaluating our lives, honestly looking deep into the reality of how we're living and not only what we're doing but what we've done in the past.
[time=86] That's right, today we talk about the great power that comes and the great freedom that comes when you and I confess our sins.
[time=95] And I wanna say this to you, while you'll hear us talk about the great power and freedom that comes when we confess our sins to God, you'll hear at the end of the message us encouraging you to think about not so much confessing but sharing openly and honestly your faults and your failures and your sins with a trusted friend.
[time=117] That's right, someone who you can trust with the real realities of your life, someone you can trust with the real failures of your life.
[time=127] And as I say that I realize that may be a scary option for you, it is for me.
[time=133] It may be something that you're not used to doing.
[time=135] You may not be living today in relationship with people at that level where you can honestly tell them everything that has transpired and all that is going on today.
[time=147] And so with that in mind, I wanna encourage you with something I talked to you about last week and that is our Friday night celebrate recovery gathering right here on campus on Friday evenings at seven o'clock.
[time=159] What a great opportunity for you to come and be a part of a community of people who are all there for the very same reasons.
[time=165] They want nothing more than to experience the cleansing, healing process of recovery.
[time=171] They're willing to do that with God and they want desperately to do that with others.
[time=175] And so I would just encourage you, no matter who you are, you may wear a coat and tie to work.
[time=180] You may be a stay-at-home mom.
[time=182] You may be an hourly worker.
[time=185] It doesn't matter where you've been.
[time=187] It doesn't matter what your life looks like today.
[time=189] You can come to the celebrate recovery gathering here on campus and meet some people who would love to walk through the realities of life and the struggles of life with you in a way that brings encouragement and hope.
[time=201] So come Friday night, seven o'clock and be a part of this amazing group of people.
[time=206] I can't wait for you to meet them and I can't wait for you to see what God has in store for you as you share with them the honest realities of your life.
[time=215] God bless you.
[time=216] Stay on this road to recovery.
[time=218] It's worth it.
[time=219] We can't wait to see what God does with our church in this series.
[time=223] I can't wait to see how God continues to grow us in our authenticity with him and with each other.
[time=230] It's gonna be a great, great few weeks as we wrap this thing up.
[time=234] Hey, have a great rest of your week.
[time=235] Thanks for tuning in, and as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=506] [MUSIC - 44 seconds]
[time=562] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 154 seconds]
[time=736] (upbeat music) - Well, as most of you know,
[time=751] we're celebrating recovery these days at Black Hawk, talking about repentance and the road to recovery.
[time=761] The road away from sins gripped, the road away from the destructive patterns of sin, the road to freedom and the meaningful, healthy, God-honoring life.
[time=773] Let me say that again, the meaningful, healthy, God-honoring life, God-designed you and I to live.
[time=783] This is the road that we've been on.
[time=786] Step one, on this path toward recovery, step one on this road to repentance, realize I'm not God.
[time=794] Step one, several weeks ago was the realization that we all have to come to that we are absolutely in our humanness utterly powerless to control and guide our lives, realizing that I'm not God.
[time=808] The E in recovery earnestly believe God exists and not only that God exists, but that God cares about you.
[time=815] God knows you, God's intimately acquainted with you and all of your past and all of your struggles and all of your humanness.
[time=823] So I realize that I'm not God and I'm powerless to control my life.
[time=827] I earnestly believe that he is God and he not only knows me, but he cares about me and wants to move me in a direction of health and recovery and repentance.
[time=837] Commit step three, this was huge.
[time=840] Commit all of my life.
[time=842] Commit every part of you, every arena, every compartment of your life.
[time=848] Commit all of my life to the care and control of Christ.
[time=853] His lordship and his salvation, the care and control of Christ.
[time=860] And step four, we come to step four this morning and I hope you'll follow along on the note sheets, openly examine my life.
[time=868] Honestly, examine your life and confess your sin to God.
[time=873] We just talked about examining ourselves as we came to the table of communion.
[time=880] And this morning it's appropriate, we come to this fourth step where you and I are to openly, we get this privilege, this chance to examine our lives and to confess the sin that we find upon examination, to confess that sin, first and foremost to God and also to someone that you trust.
[time=902] Well, let's jump in here to step four.
[time=903] Why is this, you might be asking, why is this part of the repentance process?
[time=908] Why is this open, honest examination and the confessing of my sin to God part of this road to recovery?
[time=915] Well, because of this, my friends, unconfessed sin keeps us stuck in the past.
[time=921] Unconfessed sin keeps us from growing and becoming what God wants us to be.
[time=927] And if you and if I am ever going to live in freedom, if you're ever going to live in freedom and you've got to stop pretending, you and I have to stop overlooking, we have to stop trying to hide it, we have to begin to examine our lives and confess our sin to God.
[time=945] We have to be truthful about our sinfulness and our failures.
[time=949] It's a big step.
[time=954] It's a challenging step, but it's a step that we must take.
[time=959] The truth is none of us is faultless.
[time=961] We all have sins, we all have secrets, we've all made terrible mistakes.
[time=968] So we all have regrets, we all have remorse, we all have things we wish we could turn back the clock on.
[time=976] Not your head if you wish you could turn back the clock on some things.
[time=982] And if we don't confess the sin,
[time=990] if we don't get real honest and real genuine before God with these things,
[time=999] then we embark on this anguishing, impossible journey of trying to live with the sin and having to deal then with the guilt that comes with trying to live with the sin and it just gets messy, discouraging, defeating.
[time=1021] The guilt can be so confusing.
[time=1025] You and I trying to live in that cycle.
[time=1029] We do a lot of different things.
[time=1032] We deny the guilt.
[time=1034] We try to repress the guilt.
[time=1038] We may blame other people for the guilt.
[time=1042] We may excuse the guilt.
[time=1044] We may rationalize our guilt, but whether we deny it or minimize it or rationalize it, we still feel the effects of unconfessed sin.
[time=1054] And if you're really going to repent, if you're really going to recover with God's help, with God's help from the hurts and the habits and the hang-ups of your life, then we have to confess our sin and failure, move away from a life racked by guilt and live with a clear conscious before God.
[time=1075] I was messing around on the computer again this week,
[time=1082] which I don't do very often.
[time=1083] I'm a little bit illiterate on that front.
[time=1085] I googled, forget what I googled.
[time=1087] I think it was living with guilt.
[time=1089] I found over a million, seriously.
[time=1094] I found over a million references to books, periodicals, articles on how to live with guilt.
[time=1103] And I stood there looking at my computer screen going, wow.
[time=1108] That's not at all what God designed you and I to do.
[time=1114] He never intended you and I to live with guilt.
[time=1119] Do you understand this?
[time=1120] So many people in this world trying desperately to figure out over a million references on books, periodicals and articles, trying to help people do the one thing they were never designed to do by God.
[time=1132] The good news for all of us is that God never designed or desired for us to live with guilt.
[time=1140] The good news, the gospel truth, my friends, is that sin can be confessed, guilt can be removed, and complete freedom can be realized.
[time=1149] Step four means I openly, honestly, examine and then confess my sin.
[time=1156] I love the first couple verses of Psalm 32.
[time=1159] What happiness for those?
[time=1162] What have, I think it's there in your notes sheet, what happiness for those whose guilt has been forgiven?
[time=1167] What relief for those who have confessed their sins and God has cleared their record?
[time=1175] Let me give you a couple of things, three things specifically here to write down and think about as we make our way through this discussion.
[time=1181] The reason for this fourth step, and I can just say it to you in a sentence, the reason for this is because we want to avoid the tragic results that will occur, the tragic results that will play out when there is unconfessed sin and guilt in your life and mine.
[time=1200] Reason number one, physical pain.
[time=1204] Do you understand this?
[time=1206] Do you understand that the scriptures speak to the physical pain, the physical infirmity, the physical struggle that literally shows up in your life and mine when we somehow try to make our way through life with unconfessed sin and the guilt that follows.
[time=1225] I'm gonna just, on this point here, I'm gonna just read to you some things and I hope as I read, I just hope you'll listen.
[time=1232] You might want to jot some things down.
[time=1233] Go back to Psalm 32.
[time=1235] I just quoted Psalm 32 one and one and two.
[time=1239] I want you to look at Psalm 32, three and four.
[time=1243] Listen to this, Psalm 32, three and four.
[time=1247] You want to honestly, openly examine yourself and come to this place of getting sin out on the table and confess before God because when we don't, when we try and hide it or move away from it, there's literally physical consequences.
[time=1262] When I kept silent, David here, when I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long, for day and night, your hand was heavy upon me, my vitality, my spirit, my energy was drained away as with the fever, heat of summer.
[time=1284] Maybe you've felt this.
[time=1288] Maybe you've experienced this.
[time=1291] Maybe you're feeling this or experiencing this.
[time=1294] As we speak, look at 38.1.
[time=1297] Again, a psalm of David, 38.1.
[time=1301] Oh Lord, rebuke me not in your wrath and chasten me not in your burning anger for your arrows have sunk deep into me.
[time=1309] These are arrows of conviction.
[time=1311] And your hand has pressed down on me.
[time=1314] There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation.
[time=1318] There is no health in my bones.
[time=1321] Because of my what?
[time=1322] Say it.
[time=1323] For my iniquities are gone over my head.
[time=1327] We referenced that last week.
[time=1330] As heavy burden, they weigh too much for me.
[time=1333] My wounds grow foul and fester because of my folly.
[time=1337] I am bent over and greatly bowed down.
[time=1340] I go mourning all day long for my loins are filled with burning and there is no soundness in my flesh.
[time=1350] I am benumbed and badly crushed.
[time=1354] I groan because of the agitation of my heart.
[time=1359] Lord, all my desire is before you and my sighing is not hidden from you.
[time=1364] My heart throbs, my strength fails me and the light of my eyes even that has gone from me.
[time=1376] Physically, we can feel and sense the effect written for us here, communicated in powerful graphic terminology.
[time=1388] It really is that way.
[time=1391] It's really how it works.
[time=1394] Look at Psalm 102, go back a few chapters.
[time=1398] Go to Psalm 102, Psalm 102 verse one.
[time=1405] Psalm 102, one.
[time=1407] And then we'll look at verses three, four and five.
[time=1409] Here my prayer, Psalm 102, one.
[time=1411] Here my prayer, oh Lord, and let my cry for help come to you.
[time=1416] For my days, verse three.
[time=1418] For my days have been consumed and smoked and my bones have been scorched like a hearth.
[time=1424] My heart has been smitten like grass and has withered away.
[time=1429] Indeed, I forget to eat my bread because of the loudness of my groaning, my bones cling to my flesh.
[time=1437] The scriptures teach us my friends that there is a physical hurting, a physical suffering that comes with sin.
[time=1450] Reason number one for this fourth step.
[time=1455] We want to avoid physical pain.
[time=1460] Number two, we want to avoid relational pain.
[time=1463] We'll write that down.
[time=1464] Relational pain, it's not just physical, it spills over into your relational world and it spills over into mine, believe me.
[time=1473] I've been there, I've experienced this.
[time=1476] Go back to Psalm 38, if you wouldn't.
[time=1478] Go back to Psalm 38, look at verses 11 and 12.
[time=1482] We were just there in 38, one to 10.
[time=1485] When you keep going past 10 verse 11, it says, "My loved ones, you see it there?
[time=1490] "My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague." What's his plague?
[time=1497] That's his what?
[time=1498] It's his sin.
[time=1499] And my kinsmen stand a far off.
[time=1504] Those who seek my life lay snares for me and those who seek to injure me have threatened destruction and they devise treachery all day long.
[time=1516] Unconfessed sin and damages my relationship with others.
[time=1521] When I overreact in anger and violate a friendship,
[time=1531] when I gossip about a leader whose decisions I don't like, when I'm critical and insensitive to my spouse who needed my love and compassion, when I commit these and other sins, choose not to confess them or make it right, it destroys in time the underpinnings and the foundations of those very relationships and they suffer because of unconfessed sin.
[time=1557] Guilt can cause you to spoil people, indulge people.
[time=1564] I feel guilty in this relationship so I buy her lots of stuff.
[time=1571] Parents, parents often feel guilty.
[time=1574] Parents often feel guilty and overcompensate
[time=1580] for the guilt by indulging their kids.
[time=1582] Guilt can cause you to avoid commitment in relationship.
[time=1586] You get just so close and then there's that line, you get just so close.
[time=1592] Why won't you let people get closer to you?
[time=1598] Oftentimes it's guilt, one of the reasons.
[time=1601] A lot of marriages today suffer.
[time=1606] One of the reasons a lot of marriages today have problems is because of guilt from the past, things that happen prior to marriage that a spouse still feels guilty or remorseful about.
[time=1618] My friends, we want to consider this fourth step today.
[time=1622] There are tragic results when you and I allow sin to be unconfessed.
[time=1628] There's physical pain, there's relational pain.
[time=1630] Write this down, number three, there's spiritual pain.
[time=1633] There's spiritual pain.
[time=1635] Oh, this hurts even to think about it.
[time=1639] Hurts even to read it to you, but I will listen to the heartfelt cry of the psalmist, David again.
[time=1646] It's always amazing to me.
[time=1649] David, a man after God's own heart,
[time=1657] really, literally, I believe he was.
[time=1660] David, the one, lifted up in so many ways, on so many occasions as a man of God who you and I would trust and admire and respect and want to emulate when it comes to our relationship with God.
[time=1676] And you know what, so encouraging to me, I won't speak for you, but when I read through the Psalms and as I read through the Psalms, realize the stuff he did
[time=1688] the things he confessed, the heartache that he experienced.
[time=1693] Man, I'm not saying I'm thankful that he did.
[time=1699] I'm saying it's an encouragement to me and I hope it is to you to hear what comes out of this guy's heart as he shares truth with us.
[time=1708] Look at Psalm 51, the spiritual pain that comes with unconfessed sin.
[time=1713] Psalm 51, 1 says, "Be gracious to me, O God, "according to your loving kindness, "according to the greatness of your compassion, "blot out my transgressions." Verse three and four, "For I know my transgressions, "my sin is ever before me against you "and you only I have sinned and done what is evil "in your sight so that you God are justified "when you speak and blameless when you judge "and then look at this, verse 10, "creating me a clean heart." His heart wasn't clean was it, his heart was what?
[time=1749] His heart was dirty, his heart was sinful.
[time=1752] Created me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[time=1757] His spirit was instead fast, his spirit was broken, his spirit was wandering, his spirit was distant.
[time=1763] Created me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[time=1768] Do not cast me away from your presence.
[time=1773] What greater tragedy is there on the spiritual front here as we talk about the spiritual pain that comes with unconfessed sin?
[time=1781] What greater tragedy is there than when you and I sense as David sensed here, this being absent from the presence of God, this distance that comes between he and us.
[time=1794] Do not cast me away from your presence and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.
[time=1800] Restore to me the joy of your salvation.
[time=1804] Obviously that had been lost.
[time=1806] Obviously that was gone and sustain me with a willing spirit that I will teach transgressors your ways and sinners will be converted to you, deliver me from blood guiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation, then my tongue will joyfully sing of your righteousness.
[time=1827] Wow.
[time=1830] All right.
[time=1831] This fourth step, it's a very important step, my friends.
[time=1838] And it's a very scary step.
[time=1842] Some might say this is the step that separates the boys from the men.
[time=1846] This is the one that separates those who want to talk about recovery and repentance and those who really want to pursue it.
[time=1854] So you and I coming to this place where we say I want to be physically and relationally and spiritually well, I want to grow, I want to move beyond the past.
[time=1866] I read this week somebody said I want to bury the past but I can't bury it as long as it's alive.
[time=1873] And the great truth to remember my friends is back to step three.
[time=1880] When you submit all of you to the care and control of Christ, Christ covered all your sin.
[time=1886] Christ provides the forgiveness for everything that's been done, every choice that's been made, every road you've walked down.
[time=1893] How to take this fourth step.
[time=1898] How to take there's some things that practically I want to just give you to think about here this morning.
[time=1904] How do you take this fourth step?
[time=1906] It's a simple procedure but you know what?
[time=1908] It requires an enormous amount of courage.
[time=1911] Number one, examine yourself.
[time=1912] Would you write this down?
[time=1913] Examine yourself, take a personal, it's a phrase I saw this week as I studied this.
[time=1919] Take a personal moral inventory.
[time=1922] Examine yourself.
[time=1923] What this means is that you get alone by yourself.
[time=1927] Maybe you're not used to doing that.
[time=1930] So we're learning all kinds of things here.
[time=1931] Get alone with yourself.
[time=1933] You get a pen and a notepad and you sit down and you ask yourself some very probing, very honest, very important questions.
[time=1942] What have I done?
[time=1944] Let's just be honest about it.
[time=1946] You and the pad and the pen.
[time=1948] What have I done?
[time=1948] You write it down.
[time=1949] What specifically do I feel guilty about?
[time=1954] What are my regrets?
[time=1955] What do I feel remorseful about?
[time=1957] What relationships have I damaged?
[time=1960] What sinful pattern needs changing in my life?
[time=1964] What sinful attitudes or actions have I been holding onto?
[time=1970] What have I done?
[time=1971] What specifically do I feel guilty about?
[time=1973] What are my regrets?
[time=1975] What do I feel remorseful about?
[time=1977] What relationships have I damaged?
[time=1979] What sinful pattern needs changing?
[time=1982] What sinful attitudes or actions have I been holding onto?
[time=1986] Jeremiah said in Lamentations 340, let us examine our ways and test them.
[time=1995] God says we need to examine our lives, pray and then ask God for help.
[time=2001] It's really basic, it's really simple, but wow, what a courageous effort it requires.
[time=2008] To examine our lives, pray and ask God genuinely and sincerely for the help that only he can provide.
[time=2014] Look at Psalm 139, Psalm 139, 23 to 24.
[time=2019] Search me, oh God, can you pray this this morning?
[time=2023] Would you be willing in that quiet moment with him in that pad and that pin?
[time=2028] And those kinds of questions running through your mind, would you say what the psalmist said when he proclaims, search me, oh God, and know my heart, try me and know my anxious thoughts and see if there be any hurtful way.
[time=2043] See if there's any sinfulness in me and lead me then in the everlasting way.
[time=2051] You gotta just write that out, you gotta just have that on a card, you gotta put that right front and center, not only in this time of doing business with God,
[time=2062] but it ought to be something you have front and center in the everyday of life.
[time=2066] Now when you take this personal inventory, you need to take your time, don't rush it.
[time=2074] I want you to know I've done this many times in my life.
[time=2081] I'm trying more and more so to make it a regular habit, a discipline, I believe God will use it to keep me in tune with him, to keep me growing, to keep me healthy, to keep me away from physical pain and relational pain and spiritual distance.
[time=2100] And it doesn't work, I'm gonna say this to you, it does not work unless you're ruthlessly honest
[time=2110] with yourself and you say I am going to quit pretending, I am going to lay out before God what's wrong with my life, the sinfulness that's still there, the stuff I haven't made right, and you sit down and you start writing these things out.
[time=2128] Why in writing?
[time=2129] Somebody might ask, actually somebody did ask me, this week, why in writing?
[time=2135] And I just, I found this, I thought it was great because it forces you to be specific.
[time=2142] You might say, why can't I just think about these things?
[time=2146] Pray about 'em, do it that way.
[time=2150] And I love this because thoughts, listen to this, because thoughts disentangle themselves when they pass through the lips and onto a piece of paper.
[time=2162] Thoughts disentangle themselves when they move from my mind to me writing them out, it means I've thought about it and I can say it, I can write it down onto a piece of paper, it's gotten clear.
[time=2176] If I can say it and put it down in writing, it no longer remains vague.
[time=2182] You can't just say, God, I've blown it.
[time=2185] Well, we all know that.
[time=2187] I know you have and you know I have.
[time=2188] Specifically, we need to write it down.
[time=2193] This helps us face reality, helps us stop denying since presence in our life.
[time=2199] Number two, accept responsibility for my sin.
[time=2202] Number one, we do a self-examination.
[time=2206] Number two, we accept, this is big, accept responsibility for my sin.
[time=2211] Psalm 32.5, go back there if you would.
[time=2215] Psalm 32.5.
[time=2216] It says, I acknowledge, I love this, I love the honesty, I love the clarity, I love the fact he's not looking for anybody else to dump this on.
[time=2226] I acknowledge my sin to you and my iniquity I did not hide.
[time=2231] I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord
[time=2237] and you forgave the guilt of my sin.
[time=2240] Oftentimes, most of you in the room know this.
[time=2246] Oftentimes, the greatest hold up to the healing of your sin is you.
[time=2254] That's right, you, it starts with being radically honest and saying, I am the problem here.
[time=2263] My sin, you can't keep saying if I just change relationships, I'll get through this.
[time=2272] I'll just make new friends, I'll change jobs, I'll switch churches, I'll move, I'll change towns, then everything will be fine.
[time=2280] Because everything won't be fine because the problem is wherever you go, you're there and you're the problem.
[time=2289] Does that make sense?
[time=2292] I'm the problem, it's my sin and it's affecting me and it causes physical and relational and spiritual pain and you and I have to be ruthlessly genuine about this.
[time=2313] So we accept responsibility for our sin, don't rationalize it.
[time=2318] Don't say it happened a long time ago or it's just a stage or everybody does it.
[time=2324] Don't minimize it, don't say it's no big deal.
[time=2327] If it's no big deal, how come you still remember it 20 years later?
[time=2331] I remember mine, I know you remember yours.
[time=2339] Don't minimize it, don't blame others.
[time=2342] I hear people say, well, you know what Kelly, it's mostly their fault, it's mostly their fault.
[time=2347] Well, you know what, it may be mostly their fault but God holds you responsible for the 10% that's your fault and left unconfessed that 10% can be deadly, treacherous stuff.
[time=2361] And the 10% was me just being kind.
[time=2367] It's usually more like 50.
[time=2372] Romans 12, 18, I think.
[time=2376] So far as it depends on you, if at all possible, be at peace with all men.
[time=2384] Whatever you can make right, whatever you can confess,
[time=2390] you do it.
[time=2391] The point is that if I really wanna stop defeating myself, I've gotta stop deceiving myself and pretending that it's everybody else's fault when the issue really is me.
[time=2403] Let me ask you this morning, what are you pretending to not feel guilty about, but in your heart you still do?
[time=2411] Don't you think that maybe it's finally time for you
[time=2417] to confess that and to get that out on this divine table of forgiveness and cleansing, to finally be made whole, to finally be forgiven,
[time=2430] to renew your spirit, to restore unto you the joy of your salvation?
[time=2435] Make a moral inventory.
[time=2438] Look at the list and say, you know what, that's me.
[time=2441] I accept responsibility for my sin.
[time=2444] Number three, ask God for forgiveness.
[time=2446] First John 1-9.
[time=2448] First John 1-9, if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous.
[time=2453] Your translation may say just.
[time=2455] He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=2462] Ask God to forgive you for it, for all of it.
[time=2470] Whatever it is, whatever's still hanging on,
[time=2478] whatever needs to be put up on that table, you ask God who knows you and loves you
[time=2486] and wants to make you whole, you ask him to forgive you and he will.
[time=2490] Couple things to keep in mind as you ask for forgiveness.
[time=2493] Kind of a how not to ask two things just real quick and this comes from personal experience and it comes from listening to people think this through for years.
[time=2502] Number one, don't bargain.
[time=2503] Just write that down.
[time=2505] Don't bargain.
[time=2506] Don't say if you'll just forgive me, I'll never do this again because guess what?
[time=2511] You what?
[time=2512] You probably will.
[time=2514] Don't do that.
[time=2515] Don't create more baggage in your mind and heart.
[time=2519] I'll never do this again.
[time=2521] If that specific sin is your area of weakness, you'll probably be confessing it along with me again and again and again and again.
[time=2530] You don't have to bargain with God to get his forgiveness again and again and again.
[time=2537] Ask him humbly and don't bribe him.
[time=2542] Don't say God if you'll forgive me, I'll do this.
[time=2544] If you forgive me, I'll do that.
[time=2545] I promise to do a lot of good things.
[time=2547] I'll go to church more often.
[time=2549] I'll tithe more.
[time=2551] God's not bribable.
[time=2553] And besides, there are never any conditions with him.
[time=2557] Do you understand that?
[time=2559] He's not a conditional, God.
[time=2560] He's not offering his forgiveness to you at a price.
[time=2564] That price was paid by his son who hung on a cross so you and I could have these sins forgiven.
[time=2571] You just believe, you believe that he will forgive you.
[time=2575] When we freely admit that we have sinned, we find God utterly reliable.
[time=2579] He forgives our sins and makes us as it says there in 1 John 1, 9, thoroughly clean from all that is evil.
[time=2587] I want you to write this down.
[time=2590] To admit or to confess means to speak the same thing about the sin.
[time=2595] I don't think there's a blank on your sheet.
[time=2597] Just write this down on the side.
[time=2599] To confess means to speak the same thing about the sin on your list that God says about it.
[time=2605] You agree with God about the sin.
[time=2608] You say, God, you're right, it is sin, it's wrong.
[time=2610] You don't sort of believe it.
[time=2615] You fully and absolutely agree with God about the sin.
[time=2618] You confess the sin and begin to move in a different direction.
[time=2622] My friend confession is so healthy.
[time=2626] Number four, share my failure with someone else.
[time=2631] Number four, write that one down.
[time=2635] Share my failure with someone else.
[time=2637] God says it's absolutely essential for your recovery.
[time=2643] James 5, 16, admit your faults to one another.
[time=2646] Pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[time=2648] How are we healed?
[time=2650] Well, ultimately by the sacrifice of Christ, but that healing gets furthered.
[time=2654] It gets deepened when we admit our faults to each other.
[time=2658] It gets fleshed out.
[time=2659] It comes into the everyday world of our relationships.
[time=2662] Some might ask, why do I need to drag another person into this?
[time=2665] Why can't I just admit it to God?
[time=2667] Why don't I just pray about it, make a list, talk to God about it and be done with it?
[time=2672] Why do I need to tell someone else?
[time=2675] Let me just say this to you.
[time=2676] I've wrestled with this myself for years.
[time=2678] I believe this is what I would say to you today because the root of our problem, my friend, is relational.
[time=2684] See, we lie to each other.
[time=2685] I lie to you and you lie to me
[time=2694] when we're not honest and forthright about what really goes on.
[time=2703] We deceive each other.
[time=2705] We're dishonest with each other.
[time=2707] We wear masks, we pretend we have it together, but we don't, we deny our true feelings, we play games, and it isolates us from the community, from each other, and it prevents the intimacy that God designed us to live in.
[time=2722] We end up living in shame and insecurity and loneliness.
[time=2728] If they really, we talked about this, week one, if they really knew the truth about me, they wouldn't love me, they'd reject me.
[time=2735] And with that kind of thinking, the Christian community takes a devastating hit, makes it sick, makes it unhealthy.
[time=2747] The more you hide it, the bigger it gets.
[time=2752] So we risk honesty with a person, and all of a sudden this feeling of freedom comes into our life and you realize that the healing, that the healing can be experienced and even experienced at an even deeper level when we're willing to not only confess things to him and secure and make right this vertical relationship, but the healing just kind of spreads out, goes even deeper into us when we're willing with each other horizontally to tell people what's transpired, to tell people what I struggle with, to tell people the sins and the failure.
[time=2793] Now, do I want you to just go out and hop on a box in the foyer and start screaming it out?
[time=2799] No.
[time=2800] Telling the wrong person can be disastrous.
[time=2803] You don't just go out and indiscriminately tell your problems to just anyone, you can write this down.
[time=2810] Who do you tell?
[time=2811] Somebody you trust, number one.
[time=2812] Somebody who can keep a confidence.
[time=2815] Someone who's not a gossip.
[time=2817] Someone who has a reputation for being trustworthy.
[time=2821] You tell someone you trust.
[time=2823] This could be a Christian counselor.
[time=2824] This could be a very dear friend.
[time=2827] But I think it's important that you and I find people in our lives who we can thoroughly and absolutely trust.
[time=2832] Number two, somebody who understands the value of what you're doing.
[time=2835] They don't think it's weird.
[time=2837] They don't think it's over the top.
[time=2840] They understand it and appreciate it.
[time=2842] They're grateful for your vulnerability and your honesty.
[time=2845] Somebody who understands the great value of what you're doing thirdly, somebody who is mature enough not to be shocked.
[time=2853] There's no greater nightmare than finally coming clean with somebody in that person, fainting.
[time=2860] You know what I mean?
[time=2863] Somebody who, number four, knows the Lord well enough.
[time=2866] I had deep enough level that they, I love this, that they can reflect His forgiveness.
[time=2872] We talk about priests.
[time=2874] We reflect God to others.
[time=2876] You need to find a priest in the body of Christ, a mature believer who can, having not been shocked, then begin to reflect God's grace and His forgiveness to you.
[time=2891] And you find a safe place.
[time=2892] And you take your moral inventory list and you stay to that person.
[time=2895] I need you to listen to me and help me take this fourth step.
[time=2901] Here's some things I know are wrong in my life.
[time=2904] This is what I've done.
[time=2905] Here's the sin that I have committed, that I have not yet confessed.
[time=2909] And I was thinking about this the day when someone tells me,
[time=2916] when someone says to me what I'm about to tell you, I've never told anybody, there's this feeling that comes over me.
[time=2926] And it's not a feeling of, oh cool, I get to know.
[time=2929] It's this feeling of wow, like in about five minutes,
[time=2935] this person's heart and soul is going to be completely different when they are willing to come before God.
[time=2943] And they graciously include me in the process.
[time=2946] And they get to get all that stuff forgiven and forgotten and move to side.
[time=2951] It's an amazing thing.
[time=2954] You don't have to tell everybody, just somebody.
[time=2958] And all of a sudden the secret that's been making you sick stops making you sick.
[time=2963] Remember, be specific.
[time=2966] The secret you want to conceal the most is the one you need to reveal the most, because that's the one that will most likely bring the greatest level of healing so you can experience God's grace.
[time=2979] When do you do it?
[time=2982] As soon as possible, I'd do it quickly.
[time=2986] Number five, except God's forgiveness.
[time=2989] Steve, would you come on up?
[time=2990] Except God's forgiveness.
[time=2992] Romans 3, 23 and 24.
[time=2996] Romans 3, 23 and 24, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, it says in Romans 3, 23, being justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.
[time=3011] For all in the same boat, my friends, every week somebody comes to me and says, Kelly, all these messages, the stuff that you're talking about, it's like you've been reading my mail.
[time=3023] It's like you've been following me around all week.
[time=3026] And I say no, I've just been following me around all week.
[time=3031] I've just been reading my own mail.
[time=3033] We've all got problems.
[time=3038] We've all got things that God continues to work us through.
[time=3044] God forgives instantly, don't forget this.
[time=3046] God forgives instantly, He forgives freely.
[time=3049] He forgives completely.
[time=3052] And I want you just to listen to Steve shares the story.
[time=3056] I know we're running a little late, but this was just one of those Sundays where I kind of just said to myself, "Hope you'll give me some grace.
[time=3063] We're gonna run a little bit late." And I want Steve to just share with you.
[time=3067] Steve's a good friend, everybody say, "Hi, Steve." There you go, man.
[time=3071] Steve is a good friend who has been a huge influence in my life on my own road to recovery.
[time=3078] And Steve and Lloyd and others on the Celebrate Recovery team have just been an enormous encouragement to me and many others.
[time=3086] I want you to just see a real person who's just really honestly doing his very best as part of our family to follow the Lord down this path.
[time=3095] Let him just read this to you.
[time=3096] If he can, listen, be encouraged and we'll go.
[time=3099] - I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity.
[time=3103] Hang on one second.
[time=3105] - Do, do, do.
[time=3105] Thank you, okay.
[time=3106] - Testing one, two.
[time=3108] There you go.
[time=3109] - I like to share a little bit of my life with you.
[time=3112] I've been a Christian 29 years.
[time=3114] I've been in recovery for 29 years and I'm gonna start with what brought me to Christ.
[time=3118] And hopefully when I finish, you can see the joy and hope that I have in my life yet that God's not done with me.
[time=3125] Hi, my name is Steve.
[time=3126] I'm a believer of Jesus Christ and alcoholic who is also dealing with relationship issues.
[time=3131] I was raised in a family where alcohol was a big influence on how we lived.
[time=3135] You see my dad drank a lot.
[time=3137] And because of that influence, I decided at a young age to drink.
[time=3141] Now, first alcohol was fun and exciting.
[time=3144] It made me feel like I never felt before.
[time=3147] All the hurts in the low, soft, extreme just disappeared for a time.
[time=3152] But the more I drank, the less able I was to deal with life.
[time=3155] I was always trying to find the next thing to give me the happiness and the self-worth I was looking for.
[time=3160] I can never remember just having one or two drinks.
[time=3162] If I picked up that first drink, I drank until I was drunk.
[time=3166] You see, I drank just like my dad.
[time=3168] I became the very person.
[time=3169] I did not say I would wanna be.
[time=3171] As the consequences and the pain of my drinking increase, the more I knew I needed to do something about the alcohol use.
[time=3178] I tried to do some controlled drinking, found out I could not.
[time=3182] So I decided to stop and found out I could not.
[time=3186] The cycle of trying to stop and failing went on for some time.
[time=3189] My life has become a mess.
[time=3191] I didn't know what to do or where to turn.
[time=3194] During this time, because of family obligations, I started attending a prayer meeting on Sunday nights.
[time=3199] You see, I was living one way outside that prayer meeting, but at the same time, I won that life the prayer meeting was talking about.
[time=3205] I came to avoid my life that I knew if I wanted God in my life, I needed to stop drinking.
[time=3211] Here I was, a 28-year-old male, married for seven years with maturity of an 18-year-old.
[time=3217] I was a mess.
[time=3220] You see, I thought alcohol was a problem.
[time=3223] I just stopped drinking.
[time=3224] Everything will be okay.
[time=3226] It was through this prayer meeting, my recovery started.
[time=3232] Somehow I was able not to use alcohol.
[time=3234] And life did get better because I was not doing all the crazy things I did when I drank.
[time=3240] But I did not have the peace and contentment I thought I would have.
[time=3243] I still had this obsession to drink.
[time=3245] I was always being on guard where I went, what I did, and who I saw because I was afraid I would pick up and start using.
[time=3252] Then I got involved in a secular 12-step program, and through the 12-steps, I was able to deal with a lot of issues that kept me tied to alcohol.
[time=3259] I never seen the resentments, the forgiveness, the fear and the anger I had in my heart towards others, or the hurts I have caused others because of the things I did when I drank.
[time=3269] The 12-steps gave me the structure and the discipline to really look at myself.
[time=3273] The obsession of drink was gone.
[time=3275] Peace and contentment started to be present in my life.
[time=3279] The best way to describe my life at this time was I was a Christian, active in my church, involved in Bible studies and work in the 12-steps.
[time=3286] I was right where God wanted me to be.
[time=3289] About five years ago, I started a secular 12-step meeting here at Black Oxo.
[time=3293] As a Christian, I can be open to share my higher power, who is Jesus Christ, through the 12-step meeting and to other people, and I saw people come to Christ.
[time=3302] So the first time when I was approached by helping me start celebrating cover here at Black Ox, I said, "No thanks." I was comfortable with what I was doing.
[time=3309] If it's short time later, I was asked again to get involved in celebrating cover.
[time=3313] This time I replied, "I'll read the material "and see what happens." I told my wife about it, "I told her I was too busy.
[time=3320] "Don't worry, I'm not going to be part of this." But as I read the material, got all organized on mine, this is exactly what I needed, and in many ways is already doing.
[time=3329] For to me, celebrate recovery is a place where I can bring any struggles in my life out in the open with other Christian men so I can deal with them, and there is no better place to be.
[time=3340] I have a sponsor in CR, I call him every day.
[time=3342] He has helped me and encouraged me in areas that I have difficulty with.
[time=3347] I call those areas relationship issues.
[time=3349] I let people in my life only so far, and then I shut down.
[time=3353] My sponsor has helped me focus in and make some changes in my life based upon God's word and his own experience of God has worked in his life.
[time=3362] The more time I spend spending the lessons hearing the testimonies going to meetings where Christian men and women are open about their struggles, the easier it is for me to deal with the hurts, habits, and hang-ups that I have.
[time=3374] My relationship with my Savior has grown to a much deeper and consistent level.
[time=3378] My love for my wife is more today than it has ever been, and I have a much clearer boundaries in areas that I'm playing to eight principles.
[time=3386] CR has become a very important part of my life.
[time=3390] Recovery for me is an ongoing process because I know God has other areas in my life.
[time=3396] He wants to change so that I may become the person he wants me to be.
[time=3400] Thank you.
[time=3401] [AMEN] (audience applauding) Stay right here with me.
[time=3408] Hey, would you guys just stand, and stand with Steve and I, and let me just pray.
[time=3413] With your heads bowed and your eyes closed, let me just encourage you.
[time=3418] You know, Steve talked about a sponsor, and when you listen to what the sponsor is doing with Steve, you know what that sponsor's doing is he's discipling Steve.
[time=3427] He's reminding him of what's true.
[time=3430] He's calling him to obedience.
[time=3431] He's lovingly there for Steve when he struggles, and I'm so grateful if anybody in this room, or anybody listening online wants to come and gather with a group of people devoted to this kind of process, I want to tell you again, Friday nights, seven o'clock, upstairs, room 257, they'd love to have you, anybody.
[time=3451] Doesn't matter who you are.
[time=3452] Father God, thank you for the morning, and thank you for my friend Steve.
[time=3455] Thank you for the team that's giving themselves to this Celebrate Recovery Ministry.
[time=3460] Thank you for this family, God, and the growing levels of honesty and authenticity that we're experiencing because of your word and what it calls us to.
[time=3469] God, give us strength and courage to face these challenges.
[time=3473] God, give us strength and courage to face this week.
[time=3476] Bring us back together again, if that be your will, and we'll thank you for it.
[time=3479] And all the people in the room agreed and said, [AMEN] God bless you.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
[time=3508] [MUSIC]
