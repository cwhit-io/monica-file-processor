[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] We're thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=36] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving as senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=41] And I wanna take just a few minutes today and tell you about an upcoming opportunity that we don't want you to miss.
[time=47] Over the last five years, Black Hawk Ministries has had the privilege of partnering with the Willow Creek Association in bringing to the Greater Fort Wayne area, one of the world's renowned leadership training experiences known as the Leadership Summit.
[time=63] The Leadership Summit is an amazing two-day conference in August, August 6th and 7th.
[time=68] And we're a satellite host site here and we cannot wait to see what God will do again as he encourages and challenges those like you and me who have the privilege of influencing others, whether you're a coach, whether you're a teacher, whether you own a business, whether you're a mom.
[time=86] If you have any opportunity at all in your life to influence people, the Leadership Summit is a tremendous opportunity for you.
[time=94] We wanna make this conference available to you at a highly reduced rate.
[time=98] And so as part of our Bible Hour viewing audience, we want you to go to our website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=104] There you'll find a Leadership Summit link.
[time=107] And when you click on that, you can actually just begin the registration process.
[time=111] There's a password that you'll need to get this highly reduced rate.
[time=115] The password is here at the bottom of the screen and you can use this to enter in to your own registration process.
[time=122] We can't wait to see what God will do.
[time=125] Through the Leadership Summit, we have seen him grow and challenge and envision leaders for five years and we can't wait to see what he's gonna do here in this sixth year of hosting the Leadership Summit right here at Blackhawk.
[time=139] I hope you'll give it some thought.
[time=141] I hope you'll share this opportunity with some friends.
[time=144] It has made a huge difference in my own life as a leader and I can't wait for it to make a huge difference in your life as well.
[time=152] Hey, God bless you.
[time=152] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=154] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=156] - Listen to this, once you were dead, doomed forever because of your many sins, you used to live just like the rest of the world.
[time=169] Full of sin, obeying Satan, the mighty prince of the power of the air.
[time=175] He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God.
[time=183] All of us used to live that way, following the passions and desires of our evil nature.
[time=190] We were born with an evil nature and we were under God's anger just like everyone else.
[time=198] But God is so rich in mercy.
[time=203] And he loved us so very much that even while we were dead
[time=209] because of our sins, he gave us life.
[time=213] When he raised Christ from the dead, it is only by God's special favor that you have been saved for he raised us up from the dead along with Christ.
[time=227] And we are seated with him in the heavenly realms, all because we are one with Christ.
[time=235] And so God can always point to us as examples of the incredible wealth of his favor and kindness towards us as shown in all he has done for us through Christ Jesus.
[time=252] God saved you by his special favor when you believed and you can't take credit for this.
[time=262] It is a gift from God.
[time=266] Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done.
[time=271] So none of us can boast about it for we are God's masterpiece.
[time=277] He has created us anew in Christ Jesus so that we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.
[time=287] [MUSIC - 224 seconds]
[time=518] - Thank you, Corbin.
[time=522] Thank you, ladies, band.
[time=524] It's good to be together again, and I wanna just right out of the gate here, remind every one of you who have been a part of this recent series that we've been engaged in, this road to recovery.
[time=536] It's been quite a journey as we've been allowing the scriptures to paint for us quite a picture of what it looks like to move away from sin and to move away from sin's patterns.
[time=548] Those destructive and deadly patterns that can ruin and destroy us.
[time=555] I want this morning as we begin our time for you to hear from a new friend.
[time=559] And I think it's important that we hear from others.
[time=562] I think it's important for you and I to understand that in this battle against sin's grip, in this movement that you and I want to make toward recovery and repentance, I think it's always important for you and I to realize that we're not alone.
[time=578] And I also think, and this gets a little scary at times as I think this through in my mind, but I nonetheless feel it's important that we talk honestly and openly about these things.
[time=591] And so Tom, would you come on up?
[time=593] I'm so thankful that Tom's here.
[time=595] I'll let Tom introduce himself to you.
[time=596] I'm gonna allow Tom to share with you his story.
[time=600] I'm grateful for his willingness to be here.
[time=604] Tom is a part of this community.
[time=607] He is a brother in Christ and one who has a story to tell.
[time=612] Not unlike many of ours in this room.
[time=615] What sin does is an amazing thing and I'm grateful for what God has done in Tom's heart and life.
[time=621] I want you to listen, I want you to be encouraged and then we'll move on into step five today in our series.
[time=628] Tom. - Thanks, Kelly.
[time=629] - Yep.
[time=630] - I had my first two sexual experiences at the age of 11.
[time=636] And as most of you know, when you're having sexual experiences at the age of 11, that's not a good thing.
[time=643] I remember the total rush that first experiencing experience, thinking that I'd never felt anything like that before.
[time=650] As I got older in high school, I began to believe the lies the world taught me about what it was to be a man.
[time=655] The world teaches young men that to be a man is to have athletic accomplishments, sexual conquests and to be financially successful in our work.
[time=664] That's the path that I stayed on for several years.
[time=667] After college, I went to work and I continued on in my self-centered pursuit of life.
[time=672] I was hurting me and the women with whom I was being intimate.
[time=677] When my dad died at the age of 48, I decided to start going to church.
[time=681] I hadn't grown up in the church and I wasn't a Christian, but I thought getting into religion would help fill the emptiness in my life.
[time=690] One day, three months later, I became a follower of Jesus Christ.
[time=694] I prayed all the time, witnessed to my faith, couldn't read the Bible enough and went to church all the time.
[time=700] I stopped drinking and swearing and chasing women and began living a Christian lifestyle.
[time=706] I had a daily time with God.
[time=707] I prayed and continued to grow in my walk with God.
[time=710] And at that time, I stopped acting out sexually for six months.
[time=714] Eventually, though, I sinned in this area and I continued to struggle with temptations to look at pornography and self-medicate sexually.
[time=722] I go weeks and months between giving in and falling, but it was always a struggle.
[time=727] Well, let's fast forward from there for 15 years later.
[time=731] By now, I'd been married for 13 years.
[time=734] I'd gone to seminary and was a pastor here in Fort Wayne.
[time=737] My marriage, well, I'll just say this.
[time=739] My marriage was extremely, extremely difficult.
[time=742] Also, at that time, I discovered the internet in chat rooms.
[time=746] I found that I could get online and talk to women and I could find in some false way the encouragement and intimacy that was missing in my marriage.
[time=754] When I began chatting, it was fun and it was exciting.
[time=758] But I soon began having emotional affairs online.
[time=761] In that, I was sharing with women online things I wasn't sharing with my wife.
[time=766] We then moved to Colorado to plan a church.
[time=770] The ministry was going great, but my marriage went from bad to worse.
[time=774] And I went from chatting and having emotional affairs to meeting women and then to committing adultery.
[time=780] I ended up being unfaithful several times before I ended up resigning my pastorate, leaving my wife and ultimately getting a divorce.
[time=788] I thought that if I was out of the marriage and out of my circumstances changed, then everything would be better.
[time=795] I was looking for my circumstances to change or for my wife to change, but God was looking to use those circumstances to change me.
[time=803] By this time, the cycle of sexual sin had developed.
[time=807] When I was rejected, stressed, lonely, hurt, depressed, curious, tired, I would run to the internet, get online and chat, and sometimes act out sexually.
[time=817] I thought I can control this as I could stop for periods of time, but in reality, I was self-deceived and in denial about what was truly going on.
[time=827] I was being controlled by this instead of me controlling it.
[time=832] Well, fast forward again to 2006.
[time=835] Still thinking I could control my sexually acting out.
[time=838] I was pastoring a church and I met a wonderful woman with whom I fell in love and we married.
[time=844] I had told my wife very vaguely about my past and my struggles as I was totally convinced they were behind me and I could control them because I really believed I could.
[time=853] A few months after we were married, we had some areas of conflict that were quite healthy in a normal relationship.
[time=860] However, I wasn't healthy.
[time=862] And so with the habit of running to the internet with any pain I had, I began getting online and chatting with women again.
[time=869] My bond to just sin at this point was very strong and had been in my life for several years.
[time=874] I started doing everything that I'd done before.
[time=877] Chatting and then eventually meeting women and then finally committing adultery with one woman.
[time=883] Just after New Year's Day of 2008, God exposed my sin.
[time=888] My wife found some emails that I'd written other women and then after a couple days it all came out.
[time=893] I confessed to my unfaithfulness in my adultery.
[time=896] I resigned from my church.
[time=897] My wife told me to leave within a week and filed for divorce.
[time=901] My stepdaughter would not talk to me and many my friends were either angry with me or stopped being with my friends because I deceived them.
[time=910] And actually who could blame them?
[time=913] I'd reached bottom.
[time=914] I had been fully exposed now for what I really was.
[time=917] I lost everything in my life that I was so afraid of losing.
[time=921] My wife, my daughter, my church, my livelihood in a place to live.
[time=927] A couple of weeks after all this happened, I met a guy named Tim who told me about a place called Stone Gate in Colorado Springs.
[time=933] It was a ministry run by Dr. Harry Schomburg that specifically dealt with Christians who struggled with sexual sin.
[time=940] I made my reservations as soon as I was able.
[time=944] At that point, I was willing to do anything to deal with my sin.
[time=948] It was also during this time that Tim took to my first Celebrate Recovery Group.
[time=952] I was so ashamed, discouraged, and broken and I couldn't even look up when I spoke.
[time=957] But the men there didn't shame me.
[time=959] They encouraged me.
[time=961] They said they'd pray for me and they said they'd be there for me to walk with me.
[time=966] Guys gave me their phone numbers if I needed someone to talk to.
[time=970] As God began to work in my life, I finally saw that I had been a deceiver and I was totally self-deceived.
[time=977] I was a liar.
[time=978] I was self-absorbed, selfish, arrogant, and proud.
[time=982] I was covetous and I was a rank hypocrite.
[time=985] I had wallowed in self-pity and had been in total denial for a long time.
[time=990] I knew I was sexually immoral and had been an adulterer, but the whole weight of the seriousness of those sins hit me like a ton of bricks.
[time=997] I was unfaithful in every way to my wife and my God.
[time=1000] And yet the hardest thing for me to deal with was something I'd been totally blind to.
[time=1005] I had been an idolater.
[time=1007] I'd been an idol worshipper.
[time=1009] My inner pain and the relieving of that pain had become more important than obeying my God or anything else in my life.
[time=1018] While I was at Stonegate, God did a deep work of deliverance in my life.
[time=1022] The bondage of sin in my life was broken by the forgiving healing power of Jesus Christ.
[time=1027] Upon returning from Stonegate, I continued on with Celebrate Recovery and began working the program steps daily in my life with Jesus.
[time=1035] Doing that coupled with the follow-up program from Stonegate, being accountable to my accountability guys and putting hedges in my life, primarily with my computer, I continue to walk in purity with Christ in my life.
[time=1048] The Bible says that what is impossible with man is possible with God.
[time=1053] The greatest miracles in my life have been my restoration, my relationship with God and with my wife and my stepdaughter.
[time=1060] Three months after my return from Stonegate, my wife put the divorce on hold as she saw how God had begun to change my life.
[time=1069] We continued to talk and work on rebuilding our relationship.
[time=1072] We were separated for 11 months and then on the first Saturday of December, 2008, with the help of my Celebrate Recovery brothers, I moved back in with my wife into our house.
[time=1083] And then on January 11th of this year, we stood with our pastor and renewed our marriage vows.
[time=1089] My wife and daughter have both forgiven me and were working on rebuilding our lives together.
[time=1094] God has done miracles in my life.
[time=1097] In delivering me from 40 years of sexual bondage
[time=1104] by restoring and healing my marriage relationship with my wife and daughter and by restoring my walk with God to a vital, truthful, totally open relationship.
[time=1113] I thank Jesus and I thank Him for what He has done in my life through Celebrate Recovery and the relationships I've developed there.
[time=1123] When people ask me where I go to church, I tell them I worship it pathway, but my church is Celebrate Recovery.
[time=1130] Thanks.
[time=1131] (audience applauding) - Thanks, Tom.
[time=1150] That's courageous right there.
[time=1154] And I wanna make sure that every one of you understand just a couple of things.
[time=1161] First of all, I wanna say this to the kids in the room.
[time=1164] I wanna make sure you understand what Mr. Tom just said.
[time=1169] He, in no way, glorified a life of inappropriate behavior
[time=1176] in no way did he glorify what your world and mine, kids,
[time=1182] you know we glorified what your world and our culture is trying to promote when it comes to inappropriate activity, when it comes to the downsides of the net, when it comes to illicit behavior, what Mr. Tom just shared simply brought great clarity to the absolute tragedy and destruction and futility that comes when we ignore God's direction and move outside of God's parameters.
[time=1213] So it's a great reminder to you young people and it's a great reminder to every one of us.
[time=1218] Second thing I wanna say is there may be some of you sitting here this morning thinking, gosh, you know what, we really just, we don't talk about that kind of stuff in church.
[time=1227] There were some in the room who were uncomfortable
[time=1233] for varying degrees and I just wanna say this, I would never, we would never do anything, you know, thoughtlessly we would never push envelopes just to push envelopes.
[time=1246] But part of what we've realized about the condition of the church is that its weakness is in some ways due to the fact that we don't talk about things like that in church.
[time=1256] And there are many of you in the room this morning who truth be told, you sat there and while maybe you didn't wanna grab a mic and come to the stage, there was a thought in your soul that said, boy, what would it be like to be able to just say it all and get it all out there.
[time=1276] And that is what is so attractive about freedom.
[time=1282] And it is the truth that sets us what?
[time=1286] Free.
[time=1287] And I'm grateful for a new friend willing to speak the truth, willing to share his story and what Tom shared is a powerful reminder that we all have hurts.
[time=1300] We will never forget.
[time=1302] We have hang ups, we will always wrestle with.
[time=1304] And we have simple habits that left unaddressed can destroy our lives and the lives of those around us.
[time=1312] And over the last several weeks, we've been absolutely amazed at the picture that the scriptures have painted of this road to repentance, this road to recovery and today we're gonna look at step five and a little bit of six.
[time=1326] We've been looking at the acronym Recovery and the V represents step five.
[time=1331] In step five this morning, you can write this down to voluntarily submit to every change God wants to make in my life and humbly ask God to remove my character defects.
[time=1343] It's a long one, but I want you to see that.
[time=1346] Step five in this road to repentance is to come to a place where you're willing, are you?
[time=1352] Today, are you willing today to voluntarily submit to every change, not most of them, not the ones that you think are necessary, but every change that God would wanna make in your life and then humbly ask him to remove your character defects or maybe better said, your disobedience.
[time=1372] Your disobedience, your movement away from that which God has designed.
[time=1379] Well, how does this happen?
[time=1381] How do we submit to every change?
[time=1383] How do we humbly ask him to remove character defects?
[time=1386] How do we move away from these patterns in sin?
[time=1388] I love what it says in Romans 12, one and two.
[time=1390] Romans 12, one and two, kind of a foundational text for this step.
[time=1395] Therefore, I urge you, Paul says, I beg you, brethren, by the mercies of God to present your bodies, all of them, every part, every component of your body, a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship and do not, listen, and do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed.
[time=1420] How are we, according to this passage, transformed?
[time=1424] We are transformed by the renewing of our what?
[time=1428] Of our minds so that we may be, so that we may prove, so that you may prove what the will of God is.
[time=1436] You prove what the will of God is when your mind gets transformed.
[time=1441] We prove what is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=1448] I wanna show you three things this morning.
[time=1450] It's gonna be a highly practical look this morning at some things I think are very helpful for us as we live out this road to repentance.
[time=1459] I wanna talk about where my disobedience comes from.
[time=1462] I wanna talk about why it's so hard to get rid of my disobedience at times.
[time=1467] And then I wanna show you how we can cooperate with God's change process in this fifth step and see God transform and change the hurts, the habits and the hang-ups that have been so destructive in your life and mine in many cases for years.
[time=1482] Number one, where do my character defects come from?
[time=1486] I hope you're following along on your notesheet.
[time=1488] Where do my character defects, where do these sinful patterns of disobedience come from?
[time=1494] Three things, my chromosomes, my circumstances, and my choices, jumping with me here, my chromosomes.
[time=1500] What do we mean by this?
[time=1501] Some of our sinful defects, my friends, have been inherited because both, yeah, I learned this this week, because both your mother and your father contributed to you 23,000 chromosomes each.
[time=1515] You have inherited both positive and negative traits, strengths and weaknesses.
[time=1520] You've inherited some physical defects.
[time=1522] You've inherited some mental traits.
[time=1526] You've inherited emotional strengths and weaknesses from your parents, and while this doesn't excuse the sin, listen, and while this doesn't excuse the sinful choices that you and I make at times as it relates to these defects, it does bring clarity to your disposition, your predisposition towards certain struggles.
[time=1549] It's important for you to understand this.
[time=1553] Because of your biological parents, you may have a tendency toward a hot temper, but it doesn't excuse you to go out and hurt somebody.
[time=1561] Understand?
[time=1562] Pretty basic.
[time=1564] You may have a tendency to be lazy, but that doesn't excuse you from not working.
[time=1570] We may have tendencies genetically to be given towards certain addictions, but that doesn't excuse us to go out and make the choice, and it is a choice to become addicted.
[time=1582] My genes, my genetics are one source of this bent toward character defects and disobedience.
[time=1590] My circumstances, write that down.
[time=1592] My circumstances.
[time=1593] My nurture or lack thereof is another source.
[time=1598] You were raised.
[time=1600] This isn't a bash your parents' point.
[time=1603] This is just reality in a sinful fallen world with sinful people.
[time=1607] You were raised and I was raised a certain way, and a lot of your patterns of relating, a lot of your ways of dealing with pressure, a lot of your habits you learned from the way you were successfully or sometimes unsuccessfully raised by mom and dad or those who influenced you.
[time=1627] You learned to respond to your own needs in certain ways, how to cover for yourself, how to handle hurt and rejection, and many of you were hurt, and many of you were rejected.
[time=1639] And it's left a mark on you and give you some examples here.
[time=1643] You have and I have because we were made in the image of God designed the way God designed us.
[time=1648] You have and I have a legitimate need at a very young age for respect, affirmation.
[time=1655] But if you didn't get respect early in life, you learned to settle for attention.
[time=1662] Did you know that?
[time=1664] It's kind of how that works.
[time=1666] Made by God to be respected, affirmed, didn't get it oftentimes you settle for attention, and you figured out ways to get attention in various and unhealthy methods.
[time=1677] You have a legitimate need for love.
[time=1679] You can write that down, it's so very true.
[time=1681] Boys and girls, a genuine and strong need to be loved.
[time=1686] But if you didn't get love, you may have settled for cheap sex in order to get the emotional closeness that you long for.
[time=1695] You have a need for security.
[time=1697] Every one of us from a very early age has this in-depth need to be secure.
[time=1702] But if you really didn't get it early, you may have tried later to cover for yourself with materialism and possessions that now give the outward appearance that you're finally secure because you have all you could ever want.
[time=1717] Chromosomes, circumstances, choices, number three,
[time=1723] just briefly.
[time=1725] If you choose, if I choose to do something long enough, it becomes a habit and once it becomes a habit, we get stuck in sinful patterns that are destructive and distance us from a meaningful relationship with God and others.
[time=1740] When you and I make a choice again and again and again and again and that choice gets reaffirmed again and again and again, that becomes a pattern.
[time=1752] You making that choice, me making that choice leads us to places God never designed us to go.
[time=1757] All of those three, I want you to write this down.
[time=1759] All of those three really just come back to one thing, my friends.
[time=1763] Why is this so difficult?
[time=1765] Number four, write it down there because of my sin.
[time=1768] Because of our sin, because of our sinful nature.
[time=1772] Because of our sinful predisposition,
[time=1778] it makes it so very difficult.
[time=1780] Why is it so hard to change?
[time=1782] Let's keep going.
[time=1784] People try fads, they try therapies, they try books, they try seminars, why, and it doesn't work.
[time=1789] Why is it so hard to change?
[time=1791] The defects, the patterns of disobedience in my life.
[time=1794] Number one, quickly here because I've had them for so long, that may be very, very true of you.
[time=1800] This struggle that you're facing today, these struggles that you know are a part of your everyday life, for many of you, you've been wrestling with them for years and years.
[time=1816] Tom stood here this morning and talked about 40 years, 40 years of addiction.
[time=1822] You didn't get them overnight.
[time=1824] It took years for you to develop and ingrain the sinful tendencies into the very fiber of your being and you're not going to lose them with the snap of a finger.
[time=1835] Oftentimes the duration of the struggle makes it challenging.
[time=1839] Number two, we identify with them.
[time=1841] What do I mean by that?
[time=1842] Write that down.
[time=1843] Because not only have I had them so long, but because I can tend to begin to identify with them, we confuse our identity.
[time=1852] Think about this, who we are.
[time=1854] Like really, who we believe ourselves to be.
[time=1858] We confuse our identity with these disobedient patterns.
[time=1863] We confuse our identity with our defects.
[time=1866] We say, you've said it, I know I've said it.
[time=1870] In times of great frustration and despair, this is just who I am.
[time=1876] But the truth is, and we want to lift up the truth
[time=1883] this morning, the truth is you don't have to be that way.
[time=1888] The truth is you don't have to keep walking down that road.
[time=1892] The truth is, it's not who you are.
[time=1895] Through the Word of God and through the Spirit of God and with help from the people of God, God can transform you.
[time=1902] You can change.
[time=1903] Complete this sentence for me, just quietly in your own mind.
[time=1910] I want to just show you how oftentimes we get stuck in this.
[time=1914] Complete this sentence, it's just like me.
[time=1917] It's just like me to be blank.
[time=1923] When you think about the negative qualities, when you think about the struggles that you encounter, it's just like you to be, what?
[time=1933] A workaholic, anxious, overweight, drunk, high, short-tempered, fearful.
[time=1941] See, you and I, we fill in that blank and we fill it in often.
[time=1947] And then the filling in of the blank in that fashion, what you're doing is setting yourself up to fail.
[time=1953] You identify yourself with your defect and it becomes almost a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[time=1958] When, when for the 500th time you say to yourself, "You know what, when I'm anxious, I just eat." When I'm anxious, I eat.
[time=1968] When I'm anxious, I eat.
[time=1969] When for the 500th time you say, "When I get on an airplane, I just get nervous." Then the 500, in first time you get on a plane, you're gonna be what, say it.
[time=1981] We just feed ourselves.
[time=1984] These lies that don't necessarily have to be.
[time=1988] You set yourself up and watch this.
[time=1991] This is where it gets even more scary.
[time=1993] What happens is that unconsciously, one of the reasons that we don't change is because we actually become afraid that if I really let go of this defect, if I really allow God to transform me, I've seen this.
[time=2010] This really happens.
[time=2011] People really begin to feel as if I've been this for so long.
[time=2016] I've struggled with this for so long.
[time=2020] I have so connected myself with this sinful defect.
[time=2024] My identity is completely messed up and the thought of God changing me into something else as good and right as I know this is, it almost feels scary to me.
[time=2036] I'm not sure who I'll be because I see myself as this.
[time=2040] And we stand back and we actually give it some thought.
[time=2047] And I'm reminded every time I hear about that, I'm reminded of the little boy in the ghetto that C.S. Lewis wrote about, who because all he ever knew was the ghetto, every summer looked forward to playing in the puddle because he had never been to the ocean.
[time=2067] He had never seen the sea.
[time=2069] He had never known the delight of playing in a wave and all he had ever known was a mud puddle.
[time=2075] And sometimes when this is all we've ever known, sometimes this seems a little scary.
[time=2081] Another reason why is that oftentimes there are defects that payoffs.
[time=2088] That's right, every defect has a payoff.
[time=2093] It may this defect and me living this sinful pattern out.
[time=2097] It may mask my pain.
[time=2100] It may give me an excuse to fail.
[time=2102] It may allow me to compensate or survive the guilt in my life.
[time=2106] It may get me attention.
[time=2108] My defect may allow me to control other people.
[time=2111] You see, any time a negative behavior is repeated, even though it's self-destructive, there's oftentimes a payoff that comes with the negative behavior.
[time=2121] And we don't do things that we don't get rewarded for.
[time=2124] It's just human nature.
[time=2125] Maybe you've never thought about it in this way.
[time=2129] And you don't wanna let go of that defect.
[time=2138] You don't wanna let go of that payoff.
[time=2141] And that might be consciously or unconsciously.
[time=2143] Reminds me of the relationship between emotional pain
[time=2150] and uncertainty, and the conversations I used to have with my grandpa Joe.
[time=2156] As I grew older, I've told you about grandpa Joe for years.
[time=2161] Grandpa Joe was an alcoholic.
[time=2163] And I remember him as I got older, honestly talking with me about his battle and his struggle.
[time=2170] And he'd talk about the relationship between the emotional pain that was welded up in his soul from years and years of dysfunction.
[time=2181] And the relief that came from a drink.
[time=2186] And he told me, and I know it's very basic and most of us understand this, but I remember him telling me, the first time he ever figured it out, the first time he ever put two and two together, that one drink didn't touch it, but five would.
[time=2199] And that once he got to five, the pain stopped.
[time=2204] Once he got to five, the hurt began to go away.
[time=2208] Once he got to five, he got numb.
[time=2211] And I remember him telling me how nice it felt to not feel.
[time=2216] There's a payoff that comes with the sinful pattern.
[time=2223] You have to be aware of that, and you and I need to be willing to let go of what really is in a payoff.
[time=2230] There's really no profit at all, just more loss.
[time=2236] But it's certainly in our humanness feels like it, number four, Satan discourages me.
[time=2240] It's difficult for us to move away from these patterns because my friend's Satan discourages us.
[time=2246] Just briefly here, I want to remind you that the scriptures are very clear.
[time=2249] The scriptures call Satan the accuser.
[time=2252] You've experienced this, haven't you?
[time=2254] You've experienced Satan's accusing tactics.
[time=2258] He's saying to you, this will never work.
[time=2263] You can't do it.
[time=2264] You cannot be transformed.
[time=2266] You will not change.
[time=2269] Some of you have been coming for the last five weeks.
[time=2271] You're actually encouraged for the first time in your life as you begin to face the possibility of moving away from some pattern or patterns in your life.
[time=2282] And you know as well as I know that today, when you drive home, there will be that voice in your ear that will say, who are you kidding?
[time=2289] You can't do this.
[time=2292] It is futile, it is hopeless.
[time=2295] You are stuck, you are not gonna change.
[time=2298] Satan, the great accuser, the great discourager oftentimes keeps us from moving away from that which destroys.
[time=2308] Well, how do I cooperate?
[time=2311] How do I cooperate with God's change process in my life?
[time=2316] Romans 12, Romans 12, one and two said that we are transformed by the renewing of our minds.
[time=2324] The Bible says your thoughts determine your feelings, your feelings determine your actions.
[time=2329] So we have to think biblically if we're going to cooperate with God's change process in our lives.
[time=2338] Let me give you some practical things to think about.
[time=2340] Let me give you some practical truths that I believe God can use to help transform and renew your mind.
[time=2347] Practically, number one, I want you to think about this.
[time=2350] Focus on changing as you think about and as I think about cooperating with God in repentance toward health and away from sin's grip.
[time=2358] Think about this.
[time=2359] Focus on changing one defect, one sinful pattern at a time.
[time=2365] Proverbs 17, 24, write that down.
[time=2367] Proverbs 17, 24.
[time=2368] An intelligent person aims at wise action but a fool starts off in many directions.
[time=2376] Sounds like me.
[time=2379] It's one of the things I've had to work on in my life.
[time=2383] I hear stuff like what we've heard for the last four weeks and I got 30 things I want to work on like right now and I make my list of 30 on Monday morning and by Wednesday I'm shot.
[time=2395] I'm discouraged, I'm overwhelmed, it's too much, I'm never going to change.
[time=2399] Focus on changing one defect at a time.
[time=2405] An intelligent person aims at wise action, focused action, but a fool starts off in many different directions.
[time=2412] Go back to your moral inventory that you made in week four.
[time=2417] Go back to your moral inventory and look at that list of things that aren't right in your life and say God, which of these, specifically which one of these is damaging my life the most and beg God to help you to take the word of God
[time=2436] and the spirit of God and help and encouragement from the people of God and begin to work on that one specific thing.
[time=2441] Number two, focus on victory, focus on repentance, focus on movement away from that sin, write this down, one day at a time.
[time=2450] One day at a time, similar to number one, but I want to just mention this to you.
[time=2455] I was probably in my late teens, early 20s.
[time=2457] Me and four or five buddies went on a road trip, we were in college, we went to visit one of the guys, parents, we drove up to their house, the mom and dad were great, they wanted to take us to dinner, the mom and dad and a sister take me and the four guys, five, like eight, nine people were out to dinner, they take us to this steakhouse where when you walk into the steakhouse right there in the entryway is this glass enclosed 64 ounce steak.
[time=2484] Have you ever seen a 64 ounce steak?
[time=2489] It was like whoa, these like the angels were singing and I'm looking at this steak going whoa.
[time=2496] And then there's this sign that says if you order and eat that steak we cover the entire bill for your party.
[time=2503] And my friends are like boom, they're like looking at me like dude, you can do that.
[time=2509] It was amazing.
[time=2513] So I'm thinking to myself, I think I can do this.
[time=2517] Well it was a little tricky because we're at the table, the mom and dad, the sister, all the buddies.
[time=2522] And they realize if I go for this and I do it then the whole bill gets covered so they're like, okay well should we order up on this thing?
[time=2529] You know, or is he gonna fail?
[time=2530] Should we just get like chicken fillet?
[time=2532] Well they ordered up, they had belief in me and I'll never forget at two and a half hours.
[time=2540] And my buddies are like fanning me with their napkins and they're patting me on the back and they just kept telling me.
[time=2546] They just kept saying one bite at a just one bite at a time.
[time=2551] They just kept them, come on Birdman, one by 64 ounces.
[time=2555] I lick that plate clean.
[time=2557] My family's so humiliated right now.
[time=2569] You take a lifetime, you take a lifetime problem.
[time=2582] And you break it down into bite-sized pieces.
[time=2585] And you work on it one day at a what?
[time=2591] At a time and you get God's strength.
[time=2594] One day at a time and you pray when you get up in the morning
[time=2602] you roll right from your bed onto your knees and you beg the Lord, Lord give me strength for this day.
[time=2612] Please, I wanna be patient today.
[time=2616] I wanna think pure thoughts instead of lustful thoughts, today, oh God give me strength and the ability to do that today.
[time=2626] I don't wanna lose my temper.
[time=2627] Just for today, God, would you give me strength in that direction?
[time=2631] You ask God to help you for one day or better yet, I read this week, better yet, maybe for the next three hours.
[time=2637] And if you're anything like me, and you struggle like I struggle, three hours is probably a little bit more appropriate.
[time=2647] Maybe it's hourly.
[time=2649] I was talking to somebody about this this week and they said, well gosh, if you do that then you're gonna be praying all day.
[time=2657] And we kind of looked at each other and thought, wow, maybe that's not a bad idea.
[time=2664] I need that in my life.
[time=2668] I bet many of you in this room need that as well.
[time=2672] Moment by moment, bite-sized pieces.
[time=2675] One day at a time, lick that plate clean.
[time=2679] Number three, I focus on God's power, not mine.
[time=2683] Jeremiah 1323, I focus on God's power, not mine.
[time=2687] Jeremiah 1323 says, can the Ethiopian change his skin?
[time=2691] Yes or no, everybody answer?
[time=2693] No, can the leopard change his spots?
[time=2696] Yes or no?
[time=2698] No, can't happen, not gonna happen.
[time=2700] Then you also can do good who are accustomed to doing evil.
[time=2703] How? Philippians 4, 13.
[time=2705] Many of you know it, what a great, great promise, what a great, great declaration of truth.
[time=2709] I can do how many things?
[time=2712] Through Christ, I can do all things through Him who strengthens and sustains and holds me up.
[time=2721] You already know willpower isn't enough, right?
[time=2724] We've all come to that conclusion, raise your hand.
[time=2727] If you've come to the conclusion, willpower is overrated.
[time=2730] If it worked, we'd all be transformed and healed and we're not because we can't do it on our own.
[time=2737] Willpower doesn't work.
[time=2740] You can't change your spots if you're a leopard and if you're an Ethiopian, you can't change your skin changing and moving away from sin's grip is humanly impossible.
[time=2752] We focus on his strength, not ours.
[time=2755] Number four, I focus on truth, not lies.
[time=2758] I focus on truth, not lies. Philippians 4, 8.
[time=2761] Finally, brethren, whatever is true, what a great verse.
[time=2768] Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute.
[time=2777] If there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, then by all means, he says, dwell on, focus on, set your mind on, take in these things, honorable things, right things, true things, lovely things, things of good repute.
[time=2797] We've said this before.
[time=2798] I'm gonna say it to you again quickly here, whatever you focus on, whatever you listen to, let me say that again, whatever you listen to, whatever you read, whatever you watch, is what you will, it's what you will.
[time=2813] It's not that you might, it's what you will move toward.
[time=2816] It's what you will gravitate toward.
[time=2820] Whatever you focus on is what dominates your life.
[time=2824] If you focus on illicit material, illicit activity, will keep dominating your life.
[time=2830] If you focus on what you've been, then what you've done will keep dominating your life.
[time=2838] But if you focus on the truth, God honoring values, the person of Christ, then you move in that direction.
[time=2848] Whatever has your attention has you, somebody once said, whatever has your attention has you.
[time=2854] And if you say, listen, and if you say, I'm not gonna think about a drink, I'm not gonna think about booze, or I'm not gonna think about lust, I'm not gonna think about lust, I'm not gonna think about lust, what are you thinking about?
[time=2867] As you sit there and say that to yourself, moment after moment after moment.
[time=2872] So you don't resist temptation.
[time=2876] Not once in the Bible does God command you to resist temptation, not once.
[time=2880] He says resist the tempter.
[time=2883] He says resist the devil.
[time=2884] Because as one author said, because whatever you resist persists, the harder you push it, the harder it pushed back.
[time=2892] Instead of resisting the Bible teaches refocusing, turning the mental channel of your mind, the renewing of your mind, if you're watching a television show and it gets inappropriate, you don't say, I'm not gonna watch this, I'm not gonna watch this, I'm not gonna watch this, I'm not gonna watch this.
[time=2912] You get the remote and turn the what?
[time=2914] You turn it, you refocus off of what you've been to the truth.
[time=2919] My friends, this is the power.
[time=2923] This is the life-saving power of taking in
[time=2929] and affirming the word of God.
[time=2931] I was reminded this week that there are over 7,000 promises in the Bible.
[time=2936] Probably the most helpful discipline you could ever develop is learning to memorize scripture.
[time=2942] Somebody suggested memorizing one week, one promise, one verse a week.
[time=2946] By the end of the year, you'll have 52 verses memorized that you could use to counteract these destructive thoughts that the enemy sends your way 52 weeks, 365 days a year.
[time=2960] Number five, last one.
[time=2962] Focus on doing good, focus is so important.
[time=2965] Focus on doing good, not feeling good.
[time=2969] Did you hear that?
[time=2971] Galatians 516, Galatians 516, but I say walk by the spirit.
[time=2976] You see that, but I say walk by the spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh.
[time=2987] My friend's sanctification is not about your feelings.
[time=2990] If you do the right thing, if you obey God, your feelings will eventually catch up with you.
[time=2999] If you wait until you feel like obeying, many times you'll never what, obey.
[time=3006] And Satan will make sure that you never feel like it.
[time=3013] Somebody once said it's always easier to act your way into a feeling than to feel your way into an action.
[time=3021] If I don't feel loving toward my wife,
[time=3027] if you don't feel loving toward your husband,
[time=3033] if you don't feel like disciplining and lovingly giving direction to your kids, start acting loving and feelings will come.
[time=3046] If you wait until you feel like it, it'll be too late.
[time=3050] It's amazing how oftentimes we get that confused.
[time=3054] Hey, I'm gonna ask Corbin to come on up and I'm gonna invite the rest of you to just take some time this week and go to our website.
[time=3062] I am so grateful for the activity that we've seen on our digging deeper resource.
[time=3068] The rest of your blanks there on your note sheet, all of this will be filled in for you.
[time=3072] Everything we didn't get to this morning will be covered in the first part of our digging deeper resource.
[time=3078] You click on that digging deeper icon.
[time=3080] It gives you a complete overview of the last week's message and it gives you a chance to further research and further study and read.
[time=3088] And then it gives you a chance to answer some questions that bring applications.
[time=3092] So for the rest of what we have this morning here, go to the digging deeper site by about Wednesday and you'll have it all there and we can just enjoy kind of finishing up this message together.
[time=3105] Hey, I wanna give you a chance to respond this morning and I hope you will, don't go away.
[time=3109] Let's lift our voices and let's respond to our God and worship and praise and then we've got something to end the service this morning that I really want you to be a part of.
[time=3117] So let's worship our God together.
[time=3126] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=3144] Let's stand together and sing that again.
[time=3148] Praise you, Jesus.
[time=3152] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=3271] Therefore there is now no condemnation
[time=3277] for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=3280] Because through Christ Jesus, the law of the spirit of life has set me free from the law of sin and death.
[time=3287] For what that law was powerless to do and that it was weakened by the sinful nature God did by sending His own son in the likeness of sinful man to be sin on our behalf so that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the spirit.
[time=3315] Lift up your heads, oh lift up your heads, look on them.
[time=3353] Your chains undone all rise.
[time=3363] Exhale of the sun, Jesus Christ.
[time=3371] The Holy One, oh lift up high.
[time=3376] Your chains undone all rise.
[time=3384] Exhale of the sun, Jesus Christ.
[time=3391] The Holy One, oh lift up high.
[time=3398] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=3416] - Hey, it's Corbin Place.
[time=3425] Let me just ask you for a moment here just about your heads.
[time=3428] Corbin, would you, we lift our eyes to Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith, the one who paid it all.
[time=3435] Would you just sing that chorus one more time for us?
[time=3437] Jesus paid it all as Corbin sings.
[time=3440] I want to just remind you in the room this morning.
[time=3442] I know that there are people in this room.
[time=3444] And after five weeks, you're still standing here feeling in your gut like there's no way.
[time=3451] There's no way he could, no way he could forgive everything I've done. And I just want to remind you, he paid it all.
[time=3459] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=3514] (upbeat music)
