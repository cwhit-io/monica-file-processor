[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well, hello again, and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] We're so thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=37] You know, in the last several months, all somebody has to do is just pick up the newspaper or listen to the evening news, and we are absolutely bombarded with the reality that these are very difficult times.
[time=50] We face, in this very unsettled culture, in this very, very tenuous world in which we live, economic pressures and personal pressures, employment pressures, everywhere you look, everywhere we turn, the news seems to be bleak.
[time=68] The winds are blowing very hard, and at times you and I begin to wonder how in the world are we going to survive this, and maybe more importantly, we begin to think to ourselves, where is God in the midst of all of this?
[time=82] And you know what?
[time=83] It's not just reading the papers, and it's not just the evening news.
[time=86] We have started to hear from many of you in our Bible, our audience.
[time=90] There are many in our own community right here, and this isn't just news that's a far off.
[time=97] This is stuff that's beginning to hit you and I right where we live.
[time=100] This is affecting the everyday of your life and mine.
[time=104] And so for the next several weeks, we've decided here at Black Hawk to address this and look to the one source of hope, to look to the one source of clarity, that you and I can always depend upon, and that is God's word.
[time=119] And we begin to ask ourselves these questions.
[time=121] How can I trust God?
[time=123] Is God faithful?
[time=124] Will God sustain me?
[time=126] Will God come through and protect and redeem his people?
[time=130] And we want you to know the answer to that, is one very resounding yes.
[time=134] And the reason the answer is yes is because God has been faithful.
[time=137] God has been redeeming the broken.
[time=139] God has been faithfully coming alongside the hurting.
[time=143] In times like these, from the very beginning.
[time=147] And we're going to go back over the next seven weeks to the book of Genesis.
[time=151] Seven timeless stories from the book of Genesis and the reality, the great encouraging reality that God has always worked and God will continue to work in the midst of anxious times.
[time=164] I hope you'll join us.
[time=166] I hope you'll watch the broadcast better yet.
[time=169] I hope you'll come in person and be here with us over these seven summer Sundays and take in the great encouraging truth of God's word.
[time=178] These are amazing stories from the book of Genesis.
[time=180] God's faithfulness and God's trustworthiness.
[time=183] How God spoke into and how God moved in the midst of unbelievable circumstances.
[time=189] And I hope it will bring to you, as I know, it's already brought to me great encouragement and hope.
[time=195] These are tough times.
[time=197] And these are the kinds of times where God has always been and that is the best.
[time=202] Sing this again, you baby clown.
[time=204] You may be mine.
[time=209] You love, say of the Lord.
[time=213] You are my sheep.
[time=216] Sing it.
[time=218] God, you're all this and more.
[time=220] Lord, we lift our voices to you.
[time=226] Sing it.
[time=256] Sing it together.
[time=260] You are my sheep.
[time=264] My sheep.
[time=270] We lift our voices to you.
[time=275] Sing it.
[time=276] Sing it together.
[time=279] You are my sheep.
[time=282] Sing it together.
[time=299] You are my sheep.
[time=302] Sing it together.
[time=340] Sing it together with Robert.
[time=344] All creatures of our God and King.
[time=354] Lift up your voice and with the sea.
[time=360] All creatures of our God and King.
[time=669] All creatures of our God.
[time=670] All creatures of our God and King.
[time=738] Does he really good, they ask?
[time=740] I mean, they tell you and they tell me when, you know, they say, "I know you always talk about His goodness.
[time=744] I know you always talk about how He's got a plan.
[time=746] Does He really and is the plan good and does He realize what's going on?
[time=753] Is He trustworthy?
[time=755] Will He truly sustain us in the midst of such great difficulty?
[time=760] Will He redeem the broken?
[time=762] And will He protect those who are His?
[time=767] You may hear the question asked this way.
[time=769] We've tried to incorporate some of this question into the title slide on our series.
[time=775] How can we know that God will do His transforming work?
[time=778] How can we know that He will continue to do His transforming work in the midst of anxious and trying times?
[time=786] And my friends, I'm here today to declare to you the answer to those questions.
[time=793] I'm here today to as loudly and as boldly and as grateful as I can say to every one of us.
[time=801] Will He continue to do His transforming work in the midst of anxious times?
[time=808] The answer is an emphatic yes.
[time=811] And I say yes to you because I believe the Word of God says yes to you and the Word of God says yes because my friends from the very beginning of time
[time=822] He's been doing His transforming work in the midst of anxious unsettled difficult times.
[time=831] Amen?
[time=832] And that's where we've gone with this series over the next seven, eight weeks on these summer Sunday mornings.
[time=838] We will be looking back at the beginning and what a book it is.
[time=842] I'll tell you, just going back through it recently, I've been reminded what an amazing read, what an amazing study, what an incredible encouragement the book of Genesis is.
[time=852] And we will be giving ourselves to seven timeless stories from the book of Genesis over these next several weeks and in these stories we will see my friends the faithfulness of God.
[time=863] We will see the goodness of God.
[time=865] We will see God continuing to do His work in the midst of really difficult stuff.
[time=872] He's always been doing it and He continues to do it today and I believe many of us
[time=878] will derive great encouragement as we take a look back at God at work.
[time=882] This morning the first story, the first of the seven timeless stories, we'll look at the story of the fall.
[time=888] That's right, the fall of mankind found in Genesis chapter three.
[time=892] Open your Bibles if you brought them with you today.
[time=894] Open them up to Genesis chapter three and before we look at the story of the fall we've got to be really clear.
[time=901] I want everybody here.
[time=902] I want us to be really clear on one very big point before we get to chapter three
[time=908] and that one very big point is that prior to chapter three in the book of Genesis
[time=914] what we see among other things is that God had finished His creation.
[time=919] And in chapter one we are told that God's creation by God's account and God's estimation was excellent.
[time=929] God saw as the chapter, as the text says, God saw all that He had made and behold it was very good.
[time=936] God the divine creator stood back, saw everything that He had made and seeing it all together, seeing all of it in harmony, seeing the land, seeing the mountains, seeing the sea, seeing the animals, the birds, seeing man, seeing the heavens, seeing all of it in harmony with each other.
[time=955] God declares that what He has made is really, really good.
[time=960] My friends I want you just for a moment and it's difficult for you and I.
[time=964] It's difficult for us to do this in the midst of such fallenness but I want you just to try to imagine what that was like.
[time=976] It was all the sky, the sea, the animals, man, the heavens,
[time=984] all of it unblemished, all of it perfect, all of it pristine, all of it beautiful,
[time=991] all of it just complete, nothing missing, everything about all of it was right.
[time=999] There wasn't anything wrong.
[time=1004] What a picture. What a reality.
[time=1009] And with that clearly in your minds, the story of the fall
[time=1015] actually begins at the end of chapter 2. Look at chapter 2 verse 25.
[time=1020] With all of that in view I want you to see what it says in 2.25 where it says on the man and his wife we're both naked and we're not what?
[time=1030] And they were not ashamed. They were not ashamed.
[time=1035] The word there used for naked in the Hebrew text is the word "aram" It's from the root word "aram" which can mean naked, nude, or smooth.
[time=1047] Naked, nude, or smooth. It can also mean watch this.
[time=1051] It can also mean cunning, prudent, or crafty.
[time=1057] And for those of you that know this story and where it's going, that's an interesting word isn't it?
[time=1065] Naked, nude, or smooth, cunning, prudent, or crafty.
[time=1070] I think it's appropriate. I really do that we have a word that goes beyond what we have come to know as naked or nude.
[time=1077] This infers that Adam and Eve were conscious of being sufficiently covered in the physical sense in that they had their natural clothing.
[time=1088] You see that? They had their natural clothing or skin.
[time=1092] They were smooth around. They had no concept of nudity.
[time=1096] From the spiritual point of view they had all the clothing they needed.
[time=1100] They were dressed with the consciousness of complete and absolute innocence.
[time=1106] There wasn't anything wrong. They weren't missing a thing.
[time=1109] They were covered sufficiently, and they knew it.
[time=1112] And they were at peace with this. They were around naked, and that they were prudent and intelligent enough to dispatch their duties and fellowship with their Creator God.
[time=1124] Remember God said that it was perfect, that it was good.
[time=1127] They were not ashamed physically or with respect to their function.
[time=1132] For shame implies a sense of what? Guilt.
[time=1136] Which they simply did not have because they hadn't done anything wrong.
[time=1141] They lived there in the garden with their personal and spiritual integrity intact.
[time=1148] On the other hand, watch this. On the other hand, watch.
[time=1153] As we see Satan use his oram, watch as we see Satan use his craftiness
[time=1161] to take advantage of their integrity. We'll come back to that.
[time=1164] Verse 1, chapter 3, "Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made." Now the serpent was more crafty.
[time=1175] Here in verse 1 of chapter 3, we're told of another creature, another created being the nakash or serpent.
[time=1183] There's been much discussion over the centuries regarding the snake or serpent that appeared to Eve in the garden that day.
[time=1191] Snakes have caught the interest of man for thousands of years.
[time=1195] You may love them, you may hate them, but they've got quite a history.
[time=1199] In Egyptian history, the snake occupies a primary role with the Nile cobra adorning the crown of the pharaoh.
[time=1207] In ancient times, the snake was worshipped as one of the gods and yet also used for sinister purposes, murder of an adversary and the ritual suicide of Cleopatra.
[time=1217] Snakes have also been widely revered, such as in ancient Greece, where the serpent was seen as a healer.
[time=1224] Aslepius carried two snakes intertwined on his wand, a symbol of the day seen on many ambulances.
[time=1232] In Judaism, the snake of brass is also a symbol of healing, of one's life being saved from imminent death.
[time=1239] You can read about that in Numbers 26.
[time=1242] And in Christianity, Christ's redemptive work is compared to saving one's life through beholding the serpent of brass.
[time=1251] John 3, 14, you can write that down.
[time=1253] All that being said though, a little quick history on snakes.
[time=1257] In biblical Christianity, the serpent was primarily seen as a representative of evil, a representative of sly, cunning,
[time=1268] plotting as viewed and described for us here in Genesis chapter 3.
[time=1276] Now, if you think about it, and I want you to, you stop and think about it for a moment.
[time=1282] It's possible, I believe, many people have over the years come to connect evil with snakes for a number of reasons.
[time=1289] Here's just a few.
[time=1293] They hide and strike when you aren't expecting it.
[time=1301] You ever think about that?
[time=1303] You'll hear folks say they never saw it coming.
[time=1308] Think about this.
[time=1310] The coiling ability of a snake.
[time=1314] The coiling ability can give one a false impression of his striking range.
[time=1322] So you think you're sort of being cautious and you position yourself at a certain distance, and then you realize there was more there than you thought, and he gets you.
[time=1333] And really, you shouldn't have been standing so close.
[time=1337] You should have been standing further away.
[time=1343] Snakes use camouflage to blend into the environment unnoticed.
[time=1351] You ever think about that?
[time=1354] Here's one.
[time=1355] They tend to bite.
[time=1357] They tend to strike at the feet or the foundation
[time=1363] in order to bring down a large prey.
[time=1368] Some interesting thoughts on how it is that snakes get connected to this concept of evil.
[time=1375] Let's keep going.
[time=1376] Now, the serpent was back to Genesis 3.1.
[time=1378] Now, the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.
[time=1385] This we know a lot of speculation about this serpent.
[time=1389] A lot of speculation about the snake.
[time=1391] I don't want to get into all of that.
[time=1393] I want to just say this to you this morning.
[time=1395] This we know for sure, Satan was the one doing the tempting.
[time=1399] It was Satan in the likeness of a serpent.
[time=1402] Whether it was Satan disguised as the visible shape of an appearance of a snake or whether it was a real living snake possessed by the devil, don't know.
[time=1413] Not sure either one could be a possibility.
[time=1417] But the fact that Satan chose to act his part in this serpent is born out in a number of different scriptures.
[time=1425] We see it all throughout God's Word.
[time=1427] I'll just give you a couple here.
[time=1428] Revelation 12, you can look that up later.
[time=1430] You can write that down.
[time=1431] It may be there in your notesheet.
[time=1433] Revelation 12, 9, and the great dragon was thrown down.
[time=1437] The serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world, he was thrown down to earth and his angels were thrown down with him.
[time=1447] Think about Revelation 20, verse 2.
[time=1451] And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old who is the devil and Satan and bound him for a thousand years.
[time=1458] There really is no doubt about it.
[time=1459] Satan himself was at work here in Genesis 3 in the form of this serpent.
[time=1465] The next significant point of the verse is the word crafty.
[time=1469] You see it there?
[time=1470] In Genesis 3, 1, now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field.
[time=1477] The Hebrew word there for crafty is, guess what?
[time=1481] Aram, A-R-U-M.
[time=1485] Sound familiar?
[time=1486] Look familiar?
[time=1487] Some believe that a Hebrew word play, and I would agree, a Hebrew word play is going on here because this Hebrew word to describe subtle or crafty is from the same word, Aram, A-R-A-M, which we saw used to describe Adam and even their nakedness.
[time=1505] Aram is an adjective, describes a person place or thing.
[time=1511] I listened in English, I just want you to know that.
[time=1515] Aram is an adjective meaning sensible, shrewd, even resourceful.
[time=1519] This adjective can either have a positive or a negative connotation.
[time=1523] When positive it takes on the meaning of prudent, or one who exercises sound judgment and is cautious or careful.
[time=1531] We see this positive use of the word Aram in a number of different places, Proverbs 12, Proverbs 14.
[time=1539] Proverbs 12, 16 says a fool's anger is known at once, but a prudent or a Aram man conceals dishonor.
[time=1547] The wisdom of the sensible, the wisdom of the Aram is to understand his way, but the foolishness of fools is deceit.
[time=1555] Positive usages, but, but, but, but.
[time=1558] In Genesis 3, the word Aram is used in the negative sense.
[time=1562] Therefore it denotes a premeditated craftiness or deceitfulness behind the words.
[time=1568] There is for serve, for certain there is a game of deceit going on here and the innate ability that the serpent had to be cunning, careful and wise is used in a sinful negative fashion to deceive, trick, and fool the individual.
[time=1584] Now listen people, this is a hard one to get your arms around but I want you to try it with me here. This is where we see the magnitude of Satan's intent.
[time=1594] And it's big.
[time=1598] And when you stop and think about it, it's so tragic, it's so sad.
[time=1602] Satan was there in all of his craftiness, in all of his deceitfulness.
[time=1609] We find Satan here in this text, here in this moment, for one purpose and one purpose only.
[time=1617] And as my friend Rod Ovid says, it wasn't to set up a fruit stand.
[time=1621] He was there, listen, listen.
[time=1624] He was there to bring down mankind.
[time=1631] The whole thing.
[time=1634] He knew what was at stake.
[time=1636] He's there to destroy all that was perfect and pure.
[time=1642] He's there to put an end to the Eden experience before it could spread
[time=1651] with his negative arum, his craftiness in mind.
[time=1656] Let's look closely, shall we?
[time=1658] At the approach that the evil one took in his effort to lead
[time=1664] Eve toward the fall, Satan's steps as he tempts Eve towards the fall.
[time=1673] I'll tell you this, as you go, as we look at this, I guarantee you that you will see a lot.
[time=1678] One of the things that you'll see is that his steps that he took with Eve aren't any different than the steps he takes with Gessu.
[time=1685] You. Nothing at all has changed.
[time=1690] Let me start by saying this before we get to the first step.
[time=1694] In this entire setup, and you got to be honest with yourself, we all got to just understand that this is what he's doing.
[time=1700] He is setting Eve up.
[time=1702] In all these steps, he's setting our peace, prepping Eve to fail.
[time=1707] And in all of this setup, he never once comes out right and says, Eve disobeyed God.
[time=1713] Never once does he come out right and just flat out say, Eve, I want you to disobey God.
[time=1717] He never does it, but instead uses suggestion and innuendo to aid her into reaching false conclusions of her own.
[time=1724] And then she simply follows her own misguided, inaccurate course.
[time=1732] It's an amazing series of events.
[time=1734] Satan's steps as he tempts Eve towards the fall.
[time=1737] Number one, his first step is to marginalize.
[time=1739] His first step has always been, and his first step continues to be to marginalize God.
[time=1746] To marginalize God. Genesis 3-1.
[time=1750] Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.
[time=1756] And he said to the woman, indeed, has God said, it'll stop right there.
[time=1762] As you read that, watch this, maybe you knew this, maybe you didn't.
[time=1765] As you read that, you realize something.
[time=1767] In a very subtle way, Satan begins the marginalization of God by using a different word for God.
[time=1775] Did you know this?
[time=1776] Everywhere in chapter 1 and 2, most everywhere in the chapters leading up to 3, almost everywhere immediately after 3,
[time=1784] when you see the word God in the Hebrew text, what you see is Elohim Yahweh.
[time=1789] Yahweh Elohim, the Lord God.
[time=1792] Or you see Jehovah.
[time=1794] When you look at the Hebrew and you read around this passage, the word used for God again and again is the word that lifts God up.
[time=1801] That's the word that talks about the majesty and the power and the bigness and the holiness of God.
[time=1807] It's like God, capital G, big capital G, you with me?
[time=1813] Suddly, when he says to Eve, indeed, has God said he uses the word Elohim.
[time=1823] Just Elohim.
[time=1825] It's just God.
[time=1827] Now it's God, it's even still capital G, God.
[time=1833] But if Yahweh Elohim or Jehovah is right here, big God, capital G, God, God, for all he's worth.
[time=1843] Right here, Elohim God would be right about here.
[time=1848] It's God.
[time=1850] You with me?
[time=1851] Huge God, capital G, sorta capital G, God right here.
[time=1857] He begins to diminish the view of God.
[time=1861] He begins to distract from the perspective of God.
[time=1866] Satan begins the game of temptation by lowering the level of reverence and majesty and holiness and authority.
[time=1873] Satan always wants to marginalize and diminish our relationship and our view of our great holy mighty God.
[time=1885] His desire is to attack and undermine the object of our faith so that our departure from our faith
[time=1895] so that our disobedience is really at the end of the day, not that big a leap.
[time=1903] It's a whole lot bigger deal.
[time=1908] When you and I jump to disobedience from this place of a right view of Yahweh Elohim, the Lord God who is big capital G.
[time=1917] It's a long way from here all the way over to disobedience.
[time=1922] That's a big jump.
[time=1924] It's not that big a jump from right here.
[time=1929] God, who's God, but it's just God.
[time=1934] He subtly begins to move in.
[time=1940] Second step.
[time=1942] Satan's second step is to cast or create doubt.
[time=1945] To cast or create doubt.
[time=1946] Secondly, Satan begins with a half questioning, half insinuating remark.
[time=1952] This is just, it's amazing when you really stop and think about this.
[time=1955] What he did, Genesis 3-1, he says, "Indeed.
[time=1959] Indeed, as God said, you shall not eat from any tree of the garden.
[time=1966] The purpose of this opening question was to raise." Listen, was to raise just a moderate, just an ever so slight, moderate level of doubt or questioning.
[time=1980] Maybe you can imagine how he says it to her.
[time=1984] Maybe you can kind of hear how he says it, and maybe you can hear it because maybe you've heard it.
[time=1992] I've heard it.
[time=1994] You?
[time=1997] Hey, do you really say that?
[time=2005] I mean, think about it, Kelly.
[time=2008] He really said that you shouldn't do that.
[time=2013] Really?
[time=2015] Did he really say that?
[time=2018] I mean, why would he say that to you?
[time=2022] I mean, I know he's God and everything, but I mean, really.
[time=2027] Is it really that big of a deal?
[time=2030] You've heard these words.
[time=2036] He is the master of casting and creating doubt.
[time=2041] And where that casting of doubt led with Eve and where that creating of doubt goes with you and me,
[time=2048] exact same place.
[time=2049] It leads us to this deadly.
[time=2051] It's beginning.
[time=2052] It's kind of way back here at the beginning of the process, but boy, it's a deadly statement.
[time=2056] It leads to now why would God keep that from me?
[time=2062] Now we start to think about it.
[time=2065] Now we listen to him and we start thinking, man, what was God thinking?
[time=2069] He can't really be that bad.
[time=2074] And on he goes, step three.
[time=2076] Third step, now that he's God or where he wants her is to distort the truth.
[time=2080] Satan misquotes or distorts the Word of God.
[time=2084] Now we notice there in 3-1 that he exaggerates the verbiage by making the prohibition that
[time=2092] God had spoken much greater than it was.
[time=2095] Has God said, hey, Eve, listen, has God said that you can't eat any fruit from any tree?
[time=2103] Now let me ask you, did God say that?
[time=2104] Yes or no?
[time=2105] No, God didn't say that.
[time=2108] That's not what God's word.
[time=2111] You with me?
[time=2112] It's not what God's word was.
[time=2113] See, he distorts God's word.
[time=2118] And many of you know this and I know I've experienced this.
[time=2120] Many of the sin problems we experience in our Christian lives stem from us not accurately
[time=2127] knowing God's word.
[time=2129] It stems from us not accurately knowing it, not accurately teaching it, not accurately
[time=2135] handling it.
[time=2137] We think we know it, but we don't because we don't read it.
[time=2140] We don't study it.
[time=2141] We don't memorize it.
[time=2143] We don't hide it in our hearts.
[time=2145] Many times verses are pulled out of context and bent a little or sometimes a lot to serve
[time=2154] someone's agenda or satisfy a preference.
[time=2157] So many times the inaccurate handling of the scriptures leads to all kinds of sin and
[time=2163] turmoil and trouble.
[time=2167] You know, my parents grew up in a time and in a day.
[time=2171] They grew up in a Christian culture, if you will.
[time=2173] Some of your parents maybe did.
[time=2175] Some of you possibly grew up in a culture like this.
[time=2178] You know, I think in some ways good, well-intending people, but nonetheless they didn't handle
[time=2184] this very well.
[time=2186] They, my parents grew up in a time and some of what they grew up with.
[time=2191] It was rigid and it was legalistic and it was narrow and it was stifling.
[time=2196] And some of it kind of spilled over even in my younger days.
[time=2200] I mean, I would listen to them talk and I would listen to others talk in that world and you know, they were just like there weren't any cards and there weren't any movies and there weren't any long hair and there wasn't any this and there wasn't any of that.
[time=2214] I mean, there were just these long lists of things that you just didn't do, places you didn't go, stuff that you weren't a part of.
[time=2220] And to listen to them, you'd have thought as a boy, I thought, gosh, there's got to be a chapter and verse for these things somewhere.
[time=2227] I just can't find it.
[time=2229] And then you get older and you realize they were making it up.
[time=2234] I mean, you know, no offense, but be offended.
[time=2239] I mean, it wasn't there.
[time=2242] It wasn't there.
[time=2244] And I think sometimes, man, I'm glad I figured it out.
[time=2247] You know, by like 15, I would have missed Journey and Forner and Kansas.
[time=2251] And that would have been horrible.
[time=2258] Can't tell you how many times I've sat in a restaurant booth or in my office with a couple getting ready to be married.
[time=2268] And enjoying the honest conversation that we most oftentimes have in that setting.
[time=2273] And inevitably, those conversations go to the state of their physical relationship as they
[time=2279] approach marriage.
[time=2281] Can't tell you how many times it's broken my heart to bump into people who not with a rebellious spirit.
[time=2287] No, not with a fist clenched, you know, we're going to teach you.
[time=2291] No, just like really freely offering to me the fact that they are involved sexually.
[time=2296] And it's their understanding that God's word allows that as long as they're going to get married.
[time=2304] You know, and it's just amazing how when, for whatever reason, truth gets distorted, distorted
[time=2310] truth leads to distorted living.
[time=2313] When the truth gets altered, when the truth gets tweaked, when the truth gets adjusted, just a little bit or a lot, then decisions get made, choices get made, and all of a sudden life begins to look distorted.
[time=2326] The woman said to the serpent, watch how she sort of volleys back.
[time=2331] She kind of makes an effort here.
[time=2333] The woman says to the serpent, "From the fruit of the tree of the garden we may eat." It wasn't all the trees, but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God said, "You shall not eat from it or touch it." Did God say that?
[time=2348] Nope.
[time=2349] Never said anything about touch, or you will die.
[time=2353] Okay, so let's review.
[time=2355] Watch this.
[time=2356] I think there's a really interesting principle here about temptation in sin.
[time=2362] I don't know how far we can take it with the time, but let me just at least lay it out there for you.
[time=2367] Eve's minding her own business, and Satan disguised as a snake.
[time=2374] Satan disguised as an animal begins a conversation with her.
[time=2379] You can read it a thousand times.
[time=2381] I've read it.
[time=2382] I've looked at all the books.
[time=2383] I've looked at all the commentaries.
[time=2384] There is no indication whatsoever of any concern or surprise on Eve's part that an
[time=2391] animal is talking to her in the garden hanging from a tree.
[time=2396] None.
[time=2397] You say, "So what?
[time=2399] What's the point?" Well, here's the point.
[time=2402] I believe we can assume from that that there must have been, that this must have been a creature with whom she was familiar and comfortable.
[time=2412] She was familiar and comfortable.
[time=2418] There happens to you and me so many times when we get familiar and comfortable.
[time=2426] So many times the guard goes down, so many times the resistance level drops, so many
[time=2432] times wisdom vacates.
[time=2438] More to stay there, but we'll move on.
[time=2440] Let's keep going.
[time=2441] When the snake performs this clever routine, Eve responds.
[time=2446] She read that verses two and three initially, she connects.
[time=2449] She corrects, excuse me, his protest to all trees being off limits.
[time=2453] She says, "No, it's just the one in the middle." It was kind of a strong start, going to give her a little clap at a girl Eve, but it fades.
[time=2462] She eventually gets caught up in the protest and in time even refers to her intimate friend
[time=2468] and holy majestic God, she in the same text refers to him as Elohim, casual acquaintance,
[time=2477] the common name of God, and the marginalization of God continues.
[time=2484] We see there that it worked.
[time=2485] Finally Eve follows Satan's lead and proceeds to an exaggerated statement of her own regarding
[time=2491] God's prohibition by reporting that they could not eat it or even touch it or they would die
[time=2498] Genesis 2, 17, you can write it down, Genesis 2, 17, these were the original words of God on that front.
[time=2504] You shall not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[time=2508] For when you eat of it, you will surely die.
[time=2510] No mention at all anywhere of touching, she adds it, why?
[time=2516] Why the exaggeration?
[time=2518] This is important.
[time=2520] Why the exaggeration?
[time=2522] Some might say perhaps Eve wasn't listening when Adam repeated the rule to her.
[time=2528] Maybe the forbidden became an obsession that happens.
[time=2534] But what seems most probable is that Eve was now beginning to feel as if the prohibition
[time=2542] was, and this is a very important, very dangerous word in this whole temptation game, she was
[time=2550] beginning to feel as if the prohibition was unfair.
[time=2556] God's God, she's now concluding that God has been, and that which he has prohibited, now God is seen as unfair.
[time=2564] Unfair.
[time=2565] In that case, her distortion comes from a heart that had been nudged and prodded and
[time=2572] moved with great craftiness and a ram by the evil ones, progressive questioning, doubting
[time=2581] efforts.
[time=2582] And the serpent said to the woman, "You surely," verse 4, the serpent said to the woman, "You
[time=2590] surely shall not, you surely will not die." For God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good and evil.
[time=2599] And the next step, write it down, is a combination of a denial and a lie.
[time=2604] Once Eve showed the slightest measure of doubt, and this is just like him, when he sees or smells the slightest level of doubt and you, boom, he pounces.
[time=2614] He's got you dialed in.
[time=2616] Satan went from in your window to flat out denial and lying.
[time=2618] He emphatically denied that the consequence was real.
[time=2622] You surely will not die.
[time=2623] He said he doesn't just whisper this, the grammar in the Hebrew indicates that he emphatically
[time=2629] declares it and notice that he continues immediately.
[time=2633] For God knows, he says to her, "For God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened.
[time=2638] Don't be fooled, Eve, don't let him pull one over on you.
[time=2641] You will be like God knowing good and evil." That is to say, it's not because the fruit of the tree will hurt you, it's just that God doesn't want you eating that fruit because he doesn't want you to be like him.
[time=2653] It's just this simple, Eve God's a jerk.
[time=2657] He's this egotistical God who demands your worship and obedience and then keeps from
[time=2663] you the stuff that you want.
[time=2665] Who does he think he is?
[time=2666] How dare he do that to you?
[time=2670] First Satan blatantly negates the penalty of death and he infers wrongdoing by God.
[time=2676] He lays out a case for the prohibition being evidence of God's self-serving will or his envy or his potential envy.
[time=2685] And what you and I have to stop and remember in the midst of this messiness is this, please remember this, please don't forget this.
[time=2693] Please don't let this ever fade far from your mind, my friends, that Satan is a liar.
[time=2700] He is a liar.
[time=2704] He lies.
[time=2705] He lets all he does is lie to you.
[time=2710] Whatever he's promising you right now, I don't know all that he's tempting you with.
[time=2719] I know some of it because he's tempting me with it too.
[time=2725] I don't know the specifics of what he's trying to lead you toward, outside of your marriage
[time=2732] or outside of your job or in the privacy of your own office or wherever.
[time=2739] But I can tell you this, whatever he's promising you is a lie.
[time=2746] It won't come true, it won't be fulfilled, you won't be happy, you won't be relieved,
[time=2753] you won't escape, you'll die.
[time=2758] He's a liar.
[time=2759] Jesus said it himself.
[time=2760] 44, he was talking to some guys he wasn't happy with.
[time=2763] You are of your father, the devil, he said, and you want to do the desires of your father.
[time=2767] He, your father, Satan was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there's no truth in him.
[time=2775] Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature for he is a liar and the father
[time=2781] of lies.
[time=2782] So all, so watch this, all these steps now lead Eve to this tragic place.
[time=2795] Desire and rationalization, desire and rationalization by this time Eve is captivated.
[time=2801] She became entangled by the conversation, joined in with her own insecure statements
[time=2807] and now with this new unchecked revelation she begins to see the tree in a much different
[time=2813] light.
[time=2814] Now she desires its forbidden fruit and so the rationalization process began.
[time=2823] Verse six, when the woman saw, watch this, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes that the tree was desirable to make one
[time=2834] wives, she took from its fruit and ate and she gave also to her husband who was what?
[time=2844] With her and he what ate.
[time=2849] You know as you read that verse, you've got to stop here just for a moment because as you read that verse, it sounds very familiar.
[time=2856] I told you at the beginning of this talk that what you would see is that the attempts of Satan, the steps that he uses are no different today than they were then.
[time=2864] This strategy is just the same, it's never changed.
[time=2868] And I want to lay this scenario.
[time=2870] I think about at the other end of the Scriptures back all the way back at 1 John, I think we
[time=2876] see something there that convinces us that this is true, that nothing has changed.
[time=2882] Look at 1 John 2, 15 to 17, 1 John 2, 15 to 17, I want to lay this scenario in Genesis
[time=2892] 3 next to a very famous warning given to us by the disciple John, do not love the world
[time=2898] nor the things in the world, if anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[time=2902] For all that is in the world, everything represented by the fruit of that tree, the lust of the
[time=2910] flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father but it's from the world.
[time=2916] The world is passing away and also it's lust but the one who does the will of God lives forever.
[time=2923] What we see here is that the pattern has not changed from the beginning of time.
[time=2927] This very first sin followed the same course it does today.
[time=2934] First we note that Satan first captured the ear, then the eye, then the inward desire
[time=2941] and finally the will, you can write it down, evil out her ear to listen to the tempter.
[time=2947] Don't listen to him.
[time=2951] She allows her ear to listen to the tempter.
[time=2954] She allowed her eye to feed on the object of temptation, look away, turn your head, run.
[time=2966] Don't listen, don't look.
[time=2970] She allowed desire then.
[time=2973] Once she hears it, once she feasts on it visually, she allows desire then to run away
[time=2981] with the will.
[time=2984] You can just kind of connect it in the verses.
[time=2987] When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, lust of the flesh and that it was
[time=2993] a delight to the eyes, lust of the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise,
[time=3000] the boastful pride of life and she falls.
[time=3007] She sends the first temptation in Eden and all of the millions and millions of temptations
[time=3017] by which men and women have been lured into sin ever since are fundamentally identical.
[time=3026] He's always done it the same way, I don't think he'll ever change.
[time=3031] So what happened?
[time=3033] He takes and eats the fruit and she sends and she turns to Adam and gives him the fruit and he eats it and he sends and we all became in that moment, we all became sinners.
[time=3043] And then they hear God, oh my goodness, oh man, every time I read this, I just cringe.
[time=3051] You cringe?
[time=3052] I just cringe.
[time=3053] They hear God.
[time=3054] I mean, they eat the fruit.
[time=3056] You've been there.
[time=3058] You make the choice, it says in the text that they heard God walking in the cool of the day.
[time=3064] He's coming to take a walk with them.
[time=3070] And they hide because as the text says, Genesis 3.9, you don't even want to read it.
[time=3079] Then the Lord God called to the man, who did he call out to?
[time=3084] To the man who ate the fruit first, who's responsible?
[time=3095] Men who are responsible?
[time=3096] I just want to make sure you were with me here.
[time=3101] Then the Lord God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?"
[time=3107] He said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked,
[time=3119] so I hid myself." They hide because now they're no longer unashamed.
[time=3131] Now all of a sudden they're ashamed.
[time=3135] Now they are guilty.
[time=3137] They are no longer innocent.
[time=3142] And God delivers his curse.
[time=3145] He curses the serpent.
[time=3147] He delivers the curse to Eve says, "Your pain and childbirth will now be multiplied." So in gals you can thank her for that.
[time=3157] He says to Adam, "You're going to just work your tail off your whole life and it's just going to hurt, it's going to be hard, it's going to be toil serpent, you're going to crawl around on your belly, woman you're going to have increased pain and childbirth and you're going to want to control men." Says it right there.
[time=3175] Your desire will be for the man.
[time=3178] That wasn't a joke, that was serious.
[time=3183] I know it's not very funny, but women you're going to want to control men and that is part
[time=3190] of the curse.
[time=3193] It's not going to work, it'll never go well when you try and do that.
[time=3198] And he curses man, says you're going to just work your tail off, it's going to be tough,
[time=3205] it's going to be hard, it's not going to be anything like it was.
[time=3208] They're cursed, they're now fallen, they're tainted and they're evicted.
[time=3215] Remember that?
[time=3217] They're evicted, they're tossed out.
[time=3220] Can you just stop for a moment?
[time=3221] I think Beth's got some pictures for us.
[time=3223] Can you just stop for a moment in light of all that we've seen now, especially in light of all that they had?
[time=3230] Can you stop for a moment and just look at that picture?
[time=3234] And as you look at that picture this morning, would you allow yourself to just feel what that must have been like, to have lost all of it?
[time=3245] Can you imagine the remorse?
[time=3249] Can you imagine the sense of what had been lost?
[time=3252] Can you imagine the fear?
[time=3254] Can you imagine the uncertainty?
[time=3256] Can you imagine just the horror?
[time=3259] Where were they going?
[time=3261] What were they going to do?
[time=3264] Well, it's really an amazing thing and I want to just end with this.
[time=3271] You're sitting here going, hey Kelly, I thought this was about the goodness of God.
[time=3278] There's God at work in anxious times, okay, I thought the whole series was about how God comes alongside His people and how God redeems that which was broken.
[time=3288] Okay, you ready?
[time=3289] Been waiting all, been waiting all week to show you this.
[time=3293] Remind many of you of this, others maybe you never knew this.
[time=3297] Look at verse 22, Genesis 3, 22 and 24, 22, 23 and 24, then the Lord God, Elohim Yahweh,
[time=3305] and the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil,
[time=3312] and now he might stretch out his hand and take also, he took from that tree, now if he
[time=3319] stays here, he might also take from the tree of life and eat and live forever in his newly
[time=3330] acquired, sinful state." Wow, did you ever see that?
[time=3337] I can't have that.
[time=3341] I love him too much, God says, I've got to redeem you, I've got to save you.
[time=3349] I've got to go, I've got to kick into action here.
[time=3353] What's broken has to be made new, what's lost has to be found, what's wandering has to be saved.
[time=3360] So yes, I'll evict you.
[time=3364] So he drove the man out, and at the east end of the garden of Eden, he stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword, which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree
[time=3376] of life.
[time=3377] Why don't you stand quietly with me this morning?
[time=3380] And as you stand, let me just remind you that in the midst of a regret and a remorse that
[time=3387] I don't think any of you and I could ever begin to describe in the midst of their darkest moment, in the midst of something that was just catastrophically horrible.
[time=3400] In the midst of whatever it is you're facing, in the midst of tough times, in the midst of difficult days, our God has always been a God who redeems.
[time=3410] Our God has always been a God who makes a way.
[time=3412] Our God has always been a God who comes alongside in the middle of your worst decision and says,
[time=3420] you know what, I love you, and I'm going to give you a way back.
[time=3423] And so he boots them out of the garden because if they had eaten from that tree of life they would have lived forever in their sinful state and God couldn't have it.
[time=3432] And I hope this morning that that's a great reminder to you.
[time=3436] I hope the interaction between the enemy and Eve gives you some things to think about in terms of how you do battle against him and I hope God's response at the end of the story
[time=3446] leaves you hopeful today.
[time=3447] I know it does me.
[time=3449] Let's pray.
[time=3450] God, thank you for the morning, thank you for the worship, thank you for the truth, thank you for the body of Christ, thank you that we can be here together.
[time=3458] And God, as followers of your Son, as followers of Jesus Christ, may we leave this place ready
[time=3466] to do like he did, ready to do battle with the temptation of the evil one, ready God
[time=3472] not to rely on our own strength, but God to rely on you, on your spirit, on your word
[time=3478] and the support of your people.
[time=3480] God, give us strength to do that very thing.
