[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=33] [MUSIC - 549 seconds]
[time=598] [AMEN] Let's clap for God this morning and praise Him.
[time=602] (audience applauds) Would you pray with me, Lord, in heaven?
[time=610] You are all those things that we say and sing.
[time=614] It's so much more.
[time=616] And we praise you this morning for being our Heavenly Father who takes your enemies and calls them and loves them and redeems them and adopts them and brings them into his family and calls them friends and sons and daughters of the Most High God.
[time=634] We love that about you, God, and we want to mimic that in you and we want to imitate you in that way as we look at a hurting world around us and may we open our arms to love and forgive and point them to you, the healer and restore and defender and redeemer.
[time=650] Thanks for times like these that we get to be together and pray, God, that as we continue to worship through Steve's teaching of the word that you give us ice to see and ears to hear what you'd have for us to learn and know today.
[time=664] And we ask you to the name of your son, Jesus.
[time=667] [AMEN] Would you pray with me as we begin this morning?
[time=681] I'm reminded, Father, of a song we sing here together,
[time=689] Word of God speak.
[time=691] Fall down like rain.
[time=696] Open our eyes to see your majesty.
[time=702] Lord, as we go to your word, as we run to it as a shelter this morning, I pray you would do just that.
[time=712] Open our eyes to see your majesty, to be still and to know that you are in this place.
[time=717] We offer that to you, Father, as our prayer in Jesus' name.
[time=722] [AMEN] Well, good morning, everybody.
[time=726] Happy Father's Day to all of you.
[time=729] We're going to be in Genesis chapters six, seven, and eight this morning.
[time=733] But if I could take you initially to Genesis chapter five as a word to fathers on Father's Day.
[time=741] Genesis 524 has an extraordinary statement
[time=747] about a guy named Enoch.
[time=749] Enoch is the great-grandfather of most of Noah.
[time=756] And it says about Enoch in Genesis 524, that Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.
[time=767] Enoch did not die.
[time=769] His son died.
[time=770] Very old age.
[time=771] Methuselah is Enoch's son.
[time=772] He died 969 years old.
[time=774] Methuselah.
[time=776] Grandson, Lamech.
[time=778] The father of Noah.
[time=780] And Noah all died old men, but Enoch did not.
[time=783] He walked with God, and he was not.
[time=784] God took him.
[time=787] In Genesis six, verse nine, the same phrase is used of Noah.
[time=792] That Noah walked with God.
[time=796] I speculate, and that his speculation, that Noah's walking with God had something to do with his family.
[time=804] Perhaps with the men in his life.
[time=806] I don't know that Noah knew his great-grandfather Enoch.
[time=808] No way of knowing that.
[time=811] But men, I encourage you.
[time=813] I challenge me with you.
[time=814] I challenge you to the young men in your life especially.
[time=819] To set a good example for them by the grace of God.
[time=822] To be the men that he has called you to be.
[time=825] To walk with God in such close fellowship that it is unbroken.
[time=831] This sort of special intimacy.
[time=833] Pattern it before the people in your life.
[time=835] Pattern it for your kids.
[time=837] Be an encouragement to your wife as you pattern the intimacy with God.
[time=842] It's my word to myself through you on Father's Day.
[time=848] In 1779, John Newton wrote the hymn that we're going to read as we begin this morning.
[time=854] And this hymn takes the name from the first line of it.
[time=857] So it's called See the Gloomy Gathering Cloud.
[time=860] I would like this hymn to hover over us as we read this morning, this story of the flood narrative.
[time=867] And what Newton, the same writer of Amazing Grace, John Newton.
[time=871] What Newton is after in this hymn I think is extraordinarily important and very insightful about the passage.
[time=876] So listen as we read and let this be our background for what the story is going to unfold.
[time=881] This morning we're going to be in Genesis 6-8 in the flood story.
[time=884] The story that we all know very well.
[time=886] Perhaps we'll have to unlearn some things today I would suggest.
[time=892] See the Gloomy Gathering Cloud hanging or a sinful land.
[time=897] Sure the Lord proclaims aloud.
[time=900] Times of trouble are at hand.
[time=903] "Happy they who love his name, they shall always find him near.
[time=908] Though the earth were wrapped in flame, they have no just cause for fear.
[time=913] Hark, his voice in accents mild.
[time=916] Oh, how comforting and sweet.
[time=918] Speaks to every humble child pointing out a sure retreat.
[time=922] "Come," he says, "and in my chambers hide, to my saints of old well-known, there you safely may abide, till the storm be overblown.
[time=932] You have only to repose on my wisdom, love, and care.
[time=937] Where my wrath consumes my foes, mercy will my children's spare.
[time=943] While they perish in the flood, you that bear my holy mark, sprinkled with a toning blood, shall be safe within the ark.
[time=952] Sinners, see the ark prepared, haste to enter while there's room.
[time=958] Though the Lord, his arm has bared, mercy still slows down, retards your doom.
[time=965] Seek him while there yet his hope, or the day of grace be passed.
[time=969] Less than wrath he give you up, and this call should prove your last.
[time=975] I just pray that those stanzas will be in your mind as morning as we begin through Genesis chapter 6.
[time=981] We'll begin this morning in Genesis chapter 6 and verse 5.
[time=984] So maybe flip the page, Genesis 6 verse 5.
[time=987] Some background, Kelly left us last week in Genesis 3.
[time=990] Much has happened in Genesis 4 and 5.
[time=993] In the meantime, Genesis 4 is a story, the tragic story of Cain and Abel.
[time=1001] If you allow me to say this, God's grandchildren is grandsons.
[time=1008] Cain and Abel, Cain, of course, murders his brother, the famous story from our youth.
[time=1014] Genesis 5 is the story of the generations that follow after.
[time=1018] The generations, 10 generations from Adam to Noah.
[time=1022] So hold that in the back of your mind as well.
[time=1025] It's taken 10 generations for these words in Genesis 6, 5 to be true of humanity.
[time=1031] 10 generations.
[time=1033] Genesis 6 verse 5, let's read together, verses 5 through 7.
[time=1039] The first thing we see in Roman number 1 is the fact that God is gracious.
[time=1044] God is a gracious God.
[time=1045] He is disposed to be gracious.
[time=1048] That's his default position.
[time=1050] The story is going to be bookended with grace.
[time=1052] We'll come back there in a few minutes.
[time=1054] But God is gracious.
[time=1056] We see in these first few verses the agony and the approval of God.
[time=1061] The agony and the approval of God.
[time=1064] Watch for the agony first.
[time=1066] Verse 5, Genesis 6, the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth.
[time=1073] And that every intention of his thoughts, of his heart, was only evil continually.
[time=1083] Strong language.
[time=1084] And the Lord was sorry.
[time=1087] He had made man on the earth and it grieved him to his heart.
[time=1090] So the Lord said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land.
[time=1095] Man and animals, creeping things, birds of the heavens.
[time=1100] For I am sorry that I have made them.
[time=1105] I'm sorry." What terrible words.
[time=1109] Romans 3.23 famously says, "All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."
[time=1115] That assessment is still true of us today.
[time=1117] It wasn't just true of the people living in those days.
[time=1119] It's still true today.
[time=1121] You'll notice after the ark, what God says is exactly what he says before the flood comes.
[time=1126] The man's condition hasn't changed.
[time=1129] Lying within Noah's heart, even through the flood, even on the ark, all those days.
[time=1134] Evil's lurking within.
[time=1136] The only hope for him.
[time=1140] The only hope for us is the grace of God.
[time=1144] Let's read together.
[time=1145] Back through this passage.
[time=1147] It's a hard word to translate this word sorry.
[time=1150] The Hebrew writers translated that God repented, that he had made man in the earth.
[time=1155] It's a very interesting phrase and I want to talk with you about all the theological problems that word has.
[time=1159] That isn't the point.
[time=1161] It's a very sad thing to say that God's very good creation.
[time=1165] God sees everything he's made and behold it was very good.
[time=1170] It took ten generations, ten generations to get to this point.
[time=1174] That God was very sorry.
[time=1176] God's very glad.
[time=1178] And now he's very sorry.
[time=1180] There's no way to read that verse and not be heartbroken.
[time=1183] To not truly experience God's emotion.
[time=1187] But the really heartbreaking thing about verse 11 is that it can be translated as we move on through this passage.
[time=1194] That the earth was ruined.
[time=1197] It took ten generations of people to ruin the world that God had made.
[time=1203] Hold that one for just a moment.
[time=1206] Look at verse five.
[time=1209] Only evil, every intention of his heart was only evil continually.
[time=1215] The idea is that sin has reached its high point and that sin has reached every corner of civilization.
[time=1223] Thoroughly corrupted from beginning to end.
[time=1227] Every intention of his heart was only evil continually.
[time=1232] He knows in that group Noah.
[time=1238] Noah's heart had every intention was only evil continually.
[time=1243] And everything friends hinges on verse eight that we'll read now.
[time=1253] But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
[time=1258] Noah found favor.
[time=1261] It says before that that God had decided to blot out every living thing from the face of the earth.
[time=1267] And the phrase "the word blot out" is an erasing word.
[time=1271] God's just going to wipe everybody out.
[time=1273] It had gotten that bad.
[time=1274] Children's Bibles.
[time=1276] Lots of interesting theology in children's Bibles.
[time=1279] If you guys ever know it, I've got small kids at home.
[time=1281] Children's Bibles are not always extraordinarily helpful.
[time=1284] In children's Bibles the story goes this way.
[time=1287] Everybody in the world was really bad but Noah was good so God saved him.
[time=1290] That's how it goes.
[time=1293] Friends, I suggest to you that they've missed a tremendous opportunity to communicate to us this great truth about the grace of God.
[time=1302] If you earn grace, it's not grace.
[time=1307] You cannot earn it by definition.
[time=1309] That's the definition of grace is unearned, unmerited favor.
[time=1314] Noah finds favor in the eyes of the Lord.
[time=1317] His thoughts are only evil continually, even Noah.
[time=1321] John Piper suggests that Noah recognizes this.
[time=1324] He repents and God has favor on him.
[time=1326] It's interesting to think about.
[time=1329] This language, though, friends, that I don't want to get too far away from the language of these verses, God has grieved to his heart.
[time=1338] He's bitterly indignant.
[time=1340] He's experiencing this mixture, some say, of rage
[time=1346] and bitter anguish.
[time=1349] When I get angry, I have fits of anger.
[time=1352] I do things and I say things that I ought not to do and that I ought not to say.
[time=1356] But God doesn't have fits.
[time=1359] God doesn't pout.
[time=1361] Can I say it that way?
[time=1362] God isn't a pouty God.
[time=1365] I'll get you.
[time=1367] It's not the way that God acts.
[time=1369] Even though he is grieved to his heart and he is very angry, God doesn't have these fits.
[time=1376] He says that he's going to blot out.
[time=1378] He's going to annihilate every living thing on the earth, but Noah and his family and the animals that are on the ark.
[time=1387] The great takeaway, folks, here, of course, is from Ephesians 2.89.
[time=1392] Famously, for by grace, you have been saved through faith.
[time=1396] It's not of your own doing.
[time=1399] It's the gift of God.
[time=1400] Not as a result of what you've done of works that no one may boast.
[time=1404] Noah finds approval in the eyes of God because God shines his face upon him.
[time=1410] Not because Noah deserves it.
[time=1412] Every favorable description of Noah, and the Bible is thorough with its praise of Noah.
[time=1417] Everywhere you go, in Hebrews chapter 11 and Ezekiel, he's praised.
[time=1421] Genesis 6 and 7 goes on and on about how obedient and righteous Noah is.
[time=1425] All that flows out of God's declaration of favor on him.
[time=1430] Every good thing that you say about someone in your life that you admire flows out of God's grace in their life.
[time=1438] And if you have any sort of biblical knowledge at all, and someone heaps praise upon you for how great you are, your response might always be with C. J. Mahaney.
[time=1449] When someone asks you how you're doing, he goes, better than I deserve.
[time=1455] That's a prayer attitude.
[time=1457] You know that no one never says anything in this entire story?
[time=1461] Never says a word.
[time=1464] In counterparts to the flood story in the ancient world, their speeches and the heroes do all these marvelous works, but Noah just does what he's told.
[time=1473] Just plows away, does what he's told, listens to God, doesn't say a word.
[time=1478] More on that later.
[time=1480] Verses 9 through 16 lays out for us the savagery of man
[time=1488] and the supply of God.
[time=1491] These are the generations of Noah, verse 9.
[time=1493] Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation.
[time=1498] Noah walked with God.
[time=1500] Noah had three sons, Shem Ham and J. Feth.
[time=1503] Now the earth was corrupt.
[time=1505] The earth was ruined.
[time=1507] That's the translation of that word that caught my attention this week, that the earth was ruined.
[time=1512] It took us that long, 10 generations to get to that point.
[time=1515] This is a commentary of friends on the ruin, on the ruination of man that left to ourselves we are not basically good.
[time=1523] That's a biblical doctrine that we have to hold fast to.
[time=1525] Not because we're defeatist and we like to think bad things of ourselves and we're depressive kind of people as Christians.
[time=1532] If your starting point is how great you are, then what need would you possibly have to reach out to God to say, "God, I need you in my life." The biblical doctrine of total depravity is on display in Genesis chapter 6.
[time=1547] And that evil lurks in my heart as well, friends.
[time=1554] The earth was corrupt in God's sight.
[time=1558] Someone asked me earlier if it was the earth itself or just people.
[time=1561] I don't know.
[time=1562] The human beings ruined the earth like ecologically.
[time=1565] I don't know.
[time=1566] The earth was filled with violence.
[time=1571] Reminds me of Genesis 4 and Cain and Abel.
[time=1574] It got into that point.
[time=1576] If you read Genesis 5, it says so-and-so had so-and-so had other sons and daughters.
[time=1580] So-and-so had so-and-so had other sons and daughters.
[time=1582] On and on and on it goes.
[time=1584] And this murderous spirit was just out of control.
[time=1589] And the stench of the wickedness reaches God's nostrils.
[time=1594] And in Genesis 1 and 2, it's God takes the land and there's the land takes the water and there's the water.
[time=1599] He places the water where it is.
[time=1601] In Genesis 6 and 7 and 8, God removes his hands of protection over that water and the water just flows out
[time=1607] to wash away that awful stench.
[time=1611] More on that later too.
[time=1614] Noah is blameless by comparison to his generation.
[time=1624] Romans 6, 23 says the wages of sin is death.
[time=1628] But the gift-the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=1632] Friends the gospel is on display even in Genesis 6, not just in Romans 6.
[time=1637] We deserve this judgment but God gives us grace.
[time=1640] Noah deserved to be drowned with the rest of them but God had favor on Noah and his family.
[time=1645] And it's a beautiful picture.
[time=1648] But the same thing has always been true and it will always be true.
[time=1655] God's bleak assessment of humanity applies to Noah but Noah finds favor.
[time=1660] God's supply.
[time=1661] Verse 14.
[time=1663] Look at verse 14.
[time=1666] Here we have the description of the ark itself.
[time=1668] Make yourself an ark of gopher wood.
[time=1670] I'm assuming that wood was waterproof.
[time=1673] It would be very helpful in this context having a waterproof sort of wood.
[time=1677] Nobody knows what gopher wood is.
[time=1679] We can't find it anywhere.
[time=1680] No one's ever discovered what this kind of word this is in the Hebrew.
[time=1683] It's sort of a mysterious word but there it is.
[time=1685] Make rooms in the ark and cover it with pitch inside and out.
[time=1688] This is how you are to make it.
[time=1689] The link to the ark 300 cubits.
[time=1691] A cubit is 18 inches.
[time=1693] So the ark was 450 feet long.
[time=1696] 50 cubits breadth.
[time=1698] 75 feet wide.
[time=1699] Height.
[time=1700] 30 cubits.
[time=1701] So 45 feet high.
[time=1702] The inside capacity of the ark was 1.4 million cubic feet.
[time=1708] The total deck area was over 95,000 square feet.
[time=1711] Basically the ark would cover one and a half football fields.
[time=1716] It's a very large vessel that God specifically lays out for Noah.
[time=1719] Make it like this.
[time=1722] It says, make a roof for the ark.
[time=1724] Finish it to a cubit above verse 16.
[time=1726] Set the door of the ark in its side.
[time=1728] Lower, second and third decks.
[time=1731] Moving on to the letter C.
[time=1733] We are going to make it like this.
[time=1736] Make it like this.
[time=1737] It says, make a roof for the ark.
[time=1739] Finish it to a cubit above verse 16.
[time=1747] Set the door of the ark in its side.
[time=1749] Lower, second and third decks.
[time=1751] Moving on to the letter C, the severity of God.
[time=1754] The severity of God.
[time=1755] God acts very severely.
[time=1756] Watch what he describes his actions.
[time=1758] The severity of God and the submission of Noah.
[time=1761] I don't want to sell Noah short.
[time=1763] I just don't.
[time=1765] Verse 17, chapter 6.
[time=1766] If you hold that, we'll bring a flood of waters.
[time=1768] I, God says, I'll bring it.
[time=1774] Friends, God is in control of the world.
[time=1778] He is in control of the world, of everything in the world.
[time=1786] Governments, climate forces, whatever you think of.
[time=1792] God is in charge of it.
[time=1793] That yells out to us from this passage.
[time=1797] God's sovereignty.
[time=1799] I'll bring the flood.
[time=1801] When the flood waters abate, when they go away, God sends them away.
[time=1807] I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh.
[time=1813] In which is the breath of life under heaven.
[time=1816] Everything that is on the earth shall die.
[time=1821] But I will establish my covenant with you, Noah.
[time=1824] And you will come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, your sons' lives with you.
[time=1828] And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you, to keep them alive.
[time=1836] They'll be male and female.
[time=1838] And then it goes.
[time=1841] God establishes his covenant with Noah to save him before one drop of water ever falls.
[time=1848] So again, God's not pouting.
[time=1849] God's all, I'll just wipe those people out.
[time=1851] And he doesn't act recklessly.
[time=1854] God promises to keep Noah safe and to save him, small s, before the flood even starts.
[time=1861] That's a very powerful observation, friends, in this passage.
[time=1865] Psalm 29 verse 10 says, "The Lord sits enthroned over the flood."
[time=1872] God is on his throne of sovereign power watching this happen and allowing it to happen exactly
[time=1878] as he has designed it.
[time=1879] The Lord sits enthroned as king forever, even in the 21st century.
[time=1885] Maybe it may I say especially in the 21st century.
[time=1891] God knows exactly what he is doing.
[time=1893] He will accomplish Noah's salvation.
[time=1895] Why are we so slow to trust God that what he says is actually going to happen?
[time=1900] Why do we do that?
[time=1902] Are we honestly the only generation that has ever experienced difficult times?
[time=1908] I wonder these things, friend.
[time=1910] We have conditions to what we're going to do for him.
[time=1914] These are appropriate things to ask from the text.
[time=1916] Look at verse 22.
[time=1920] Noah did this.
[time=1922] He did all that God commanded him.
[time=1927] Do you ever partition off your obedience?
[time=1931] I'll go this far.
[time=1933] That's as far as I'm willing to go.
[time=1935] Noah is clear more than once in this passage that he does everything that God intends him to do.
[time=1941] He builds a boat.
[time=1942] This isn't going to be boats before this.
[time=1943] We don't know, but this is the first boat to build a boat.
[time=1948] Okay.
[time=1949] I'll build a boat.
[time=1950] It's going to rain.
[time=1951] It would seem.
[time=1952] There's no rain before this, so it would seem as well.
[time=1955] All these things, Noah acts in faith.
[time=1960] The first takeaway from this passage, guys, is that God is gracious to Noah.
[time=1965] The second point here, Roman, who were two in your outline from chapter 7, is that God is just, and he's both.
[time=1972] Gracious and just.
[time=1973] I have to talk to my students about not tying God's hands behind his back.
[time=1978] We love that God is gracious sometimes, but not that he's just.
[time=1982] We tie it behind his back.
[time=1984] Others like to say that God is just, but tie his gracious hand behind his back.
[time=1988] What we see in the Old Testament is a two-handed God.
[time=1991] Not too face, but too handed.
[time=1994] His grace and his justice are always outstretched, no more so than in this passage.
[time=1999] In chapter 7, verses 1 through 10, lay out for us the Lord's rule and reliability.
[time=2008] God says to Noah directly, "I am going to blot everything out, Noah.
[time=2014] And unless you get in, go into the ark," he says.
[time=2018] "Unless you get in, you will be destroyed." It's definitely in there.
[time=2023] The only way Noah could be saved is getting into that ark.
[time=2028] God's rule and reliability are on display.
[time=2032] We see here the Lord's rule and reliability.
[time=2036] God isn't just flexing his muscles to sort of force his will on Noah.
[time=2043] He is mercifully telling him, "Get in the ark." Have you ever heard people say things about how God is?
[time=2051] He seems sort of bossy.
[time=2055] Have you ever heard that kind of attitude anywhere out there?
[time=2058] I remember I talked with you folks early last year in January of '08 about how why God is not an ego test.
[time=2064] Do you remember that?
[time=2066] Why God is not an ego test?
[time=2068] It's an embarrassing thing even for me to say.
[time=2072] Do you know when God says to us that the only way to be saved is through Jesus Christ?
[time=2076] That's a gracious thing to say.
[time=2079] There aren't lots of ways to be saved.
[time=2081] If there were, that would be a cruel thing for God to say.
[time=2084] Only Jesus.
[time=2086] But because there's only one way to be saved, he says, "Follow after Jesus."
[time=2092] The only way for Noah to be saved was to get in the arks.
[time=2095] God says, "Get in the ark, Noah." And God says to you and I, "The only way for you to be saved is through Jesus Christ and his cross."
[time=2104] The only way to be saved is through Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[time=2109] The only way to be saved and for God to tell us that is gracious, merciful, not exclusive, just to be exclusive.
[time=2120] It's very important.
[time=2123] Once again, if God had not told Noah and his family what to do, they would have been destroyed.
[time=2130] God is telling us to do things.
[time=2133] Did you hear John Newton's words in the hymn?
[time=2135] There's a cloud, there's a storm gathering.
[time=2139] Come to Jesus.
[time=2143] The Lord is reliable.
[time=2146] Noah is 600 years in verse six.
[time=2149] That's old.
[time=2150] I thought you should know.
[time=2151] That's a very big number.
[time=2153] 600 years.
[time=2155] I feel old sometimes.
[time=2157] I'm not going to live to be 600 years old.
[time=2158] That's very old.
[time=2159] I just thought I would observe that with you.
[time=2162] What happened in verse six?
[time=2164] What came on the earth?
[time=2167] The flood of waters came on the earth because God says the flood's coming and guess what?
[time=2171] The flood comes.
[time=2177] Everywhere you turn.
[time=2179] No.
[time=2180] Everywhere we turn in the Bible, it emphatically declares that what God says will come to pass.
[time=2188] Everywhere we go.
[time=2192] If God says the flood is coming, guess what?
[time=2195] The flood is coming.
[time=2196] If God says in the Psalms, Psalm 34 that he is near to the broken hearted and he saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[time=2205] Guess what?
[time=2206] He is.
[time=2208] If he promises us in Hebrews 13 through Joshua 1 that he will never leave us or forsake us, guess what?
[time=2215] He won't.
[time=2218] When Jesus says to his disciples that he will be with them always to the very end of the age, he will.
[time=2230] He will.
[time=2231] Are there circumstances so grave in our life that we would start to doubt those words?
[time=2236] I hope not, friends.
[time=2239] We move on in chapter seven to see the Lord's power and protection verses 11 through 16, chapter 7, the Lord's power and protection.
[time=2247] Look at verse 11, this was interesting to me.
[time=2250] In the 600th year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the 17th day of the month, on that day, these details have no symbolic significance that I can tell.
[time=2264] So, why are they there?
[time=2270] The flood is a children's story.
[time=2275] I've got a picture of my daughter made for me this morning for Father's Day.
[time=2279] Can the cameras get this?
[time=2280] I don't know if you guys can get this or not.
[time=2282] It reminded me of the flood story, all the animals coming in, I don't know why.
[time=2287] It's a very abstract art here, which is quickly lines.
[time=2291] It reminded me, I don't know why it reminded me of that.
[time=2293] Maybe I'm thinking about the Ark for the last several weeks.
[time=2296] I was thinking about everything in that way.
[time=2301] The flood actually happened.
[time=2306] It isn't a kid's story.
[time=2308] Stop.
[time=2309] It happened.
[time=2311] It really did happen.
[time=2312] That wasn't a global flood.
[time=2314] Guys, there are pages of scientific questions.
[time=2317] I'm not a scientist.
[time=2318] I'm not even going to go there.
[time=2320] You can read on that if you want to.
[time=2322] It's not my objective this morning.
[time=2324] What is my objective is to tell you that the flood really did actually happen.
[time=2327] It was an historical event.
[time=2329] Do I understand all the things that happened with it?
[time=2331] No.
[time=2332] Mountains covered by 22 feet of water.
[time=2334] I don't understand that.
[time=2336] But these details in verse, in chapter seven, about how old Noah was and what happens at
[time=2348] this point and all of those things, it matters.
[time=2356] It just does.
[time=2362] Okay.
[time=2363] Verse 11.
[time=2364] All the fountains of the great deep and the windows of the heavens were opened.
[time=2368] See, they were opened.
[time=2369] They were allowed to open.
[time=2370] What does it mean fountains of the deep and windows of the heavens?
[time=2373] I don't know.
[time=2374] Lots of water is what it means.
[time=2377] Beyond that, I don't know what it means.
[time=2380] But God is sovereign even in the things that He allows to happen.
[time=2385] So when God says, here's the land and here's the water, in this passage He takes the water and He says, and the water gushes forth.
[time=2398] Rain fell upon the earth for 40 days, verse 12.
[time=2401] God is undoing creation.
[time=2404] It's a frightful thing.
[time=2406] God is reversing the created order by allowing all this chaos to ensue under His control.
[time=2413] See, the earth was formless and void at one point, but God makes it orderly.
[time=2417] He makes it the way it needs to be.
[time=2419] And now God brings that chaos back out in judgment of sin.
[time=2423] It's terrible thing to watch.
[time=2425] And it really does actually happen.
[time=2427] The windows were open, friends.
[time=2429] I just say to you again that God's in control of all things, even these things.
[time=2433] But God protects Noah.
[time=2434] You see here, let her be the Lord's power in protection.
[time=2436] The Lord's power in protection.
[time=2438] A little phrase here, end of verse 16.
[time=2442] The Lord's Sutterman.
[time=2447] An ancient world has lots of parallel accounts of the flood story.
[time=2450] There's a story called the Gilgamesh Epic, which is famous as a way for people to say, well, there's other flood stories too in the ancient world.
[time=2457] The hero of that story shuts himself in.
[time=2461] Noah is shut in.
[time=2464] The door is closed from the outside.
[time=2467] It's a six word.
[time=2468] The Lord shut him in.
[time=2471] That's six.
[time=2473] It was closed from the outside.
[time=2475] It's a very powerful little message that God protects Noah.
[time=2479] That God is the hero of the story.
[time=2481] That's some other guy.
[time=2482] The guy's name is Utna Pashtim.
[time=2485] Not him.
[time=2486] Not Noah.
[time=2488] God.
[time=2489] Let her see.
[time=2491] Moving right along.
[time=2493] So much to say here, friends.
[time=2495] The Lord's awesome and awful judgment is seen at the end of chapter 7.
[time=2499] Awesome judgment.
[time=2500] Mountains are covered by 22 feet.
[time=2503] 15 cubits is about 22 feet.
[time=2507] It's extraordinary.
[time=2508] It's extraordinary to imagine that.
[time=2512] This judgment is awful, verse 21.
[time=2514] And by awful, I mean full of awe.
[time=2517] It doesn't mean bad in that way.
[time=2520] I mean that the word is taken from that phrase to be full of awe.
[time=2523] It strikes me that way.
[time=2525] Every look at verse 21.
[time=2527] All flesh died that moved in the earth.
[time=2529] Birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth.
[time=2533] And all mankind.
[time=2534] Everything on the dry land and whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
[time=2538] He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground.
[time=2542] In verse 4, God says he's going to blot out.
[time=2544] He blots it out in verse 23.
[time=2546] He will do what he says for better and for worse.
[time=2551] Only Noah was left.
[time=2553] Noah was left.
[time=2554] Verse 23.
[time=2555] Do you see that?
[time=2556] I'm only that in your Bibles.
[time=2557] Noah was left.
[time=2560] Noah escapes the wrath of God because God allows him to escape his wrath.
[time=2566] God, it's a passive verb.
[time=2568] Noah was left.
[time=2570] And his family.
[time=2572] Because he's gracious.
[time=2575] He doesn't survive because he's good enough.
[time=2577] He survives because he's left by Yahweh.
[time=2579] By God.
[time=2581] God is gracious.
[time=2583] Friends, he is just and he's both.
[time=2585] Lastly, we see together that God is faithful.
[time=2589] It's an embarrassing question that we have on the screen before about is God still faithful
[time=2595] and anxious times?
[time=2596] That question we're going to be asking all summer.
[time=2598] I also want to come up on stage and say yes and go back and sit down.
[time=2604] I know it's an important question for us to answer.
[time=2606] I don't mean to make a light of it.
[time=2608] But may I just submit to you that that is the answer to the question?
[time=2612] God is so faithful.
[time=2613] Watch this.
[time=2616] Chapter 8.
[time=2619] Verses 1 to 5.
[time=2620] But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock.
[time=2624] They're all in there.
[time=2625] How are they all in there?
[time=2626] I don't know.
[time=2628] But they're all in there.
[time=2629] God made a wind.
[time=2633] To blow over the earth.
[time=2634] The waters subsided.
[time=2635] The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed.
[time=2638] The rain from the heavens were restrained.
[time=2640] God is the hero.
[time=2644] Can I go back to the first page of your outline from home?
[time=2647] I forgot to take a couple of things that I want to miss telling you.
[time=2649] Romanian rule 2, letter A.
[time=2653] Noah is obedient with everything.
[time=2655] It says that he was obedient.
[time=2656] And the question there was under letter A was what's God telling you to do?
[time=2659] I'll come back in a little bit.
[time=2662] We see letter B there, the Lord's power and protection.
[time=2667] The God is in control of all things just by way of review.
[time=2670] I don't want to miss those.
[time=2671] I know how frustrating that can be to miss those points in the outline.
[time=2676] Letter A here, the Lord remembers and the waters recede.
[time=2679] God is the hero.
[time=2681] Exclamation point.
[time=2682] Circle that on your page.
[time=2683] Just do it for me, please.
[time=2684] Just circle it.
[time=2685] God is the hero.
[time=2687] God is the hero of the story.
[time=2689] Of every story in Genesis.
[time=2693] May I say that again?
[time=2695] I'll invite you to respond when I say it.
[time=2697] God is the hero of every story in Genesis.
[time=2700] Every story, every great person we meet in Genesis and there are some great people in there.
[time=2705] God is the hero.
[time=2708] In Joseph's life.
[time=2710] God is the hero.
[time=2712] Just so happens, all these things in Joseph's life, just so happens that there's a famine.
[time=2716] Just so happens that there's Joseph's impulse.
[time=2718] It still happens.
[time=2719] Well, how does that just so happen?
[time=2722] It's remarkable.
[time=2727] Noah is obedient.
[time=2728] We got a praise for his obedience.
[time=2729] I don't be careful about that, but God is the hero.
[time=2733] Noah doesn't say a word the whole story.
[time=2735] I've mentioned that before.
[time=2736] It's just a powerful observation.
[time=2738] The waters recede from the earth verse three continually.
[time=2741] All these things happen under the Lord's control.
[time=2746] Everything.
[time=2748] Everything happens under his control.
[time=2751] What circumstances do we think are outside of his control this morning?
[time=2755] I must ask.
[time=2758] I hope this story can redeem our thinking a little bit.
[time=2761] I hope so.
[time=2763] Nothing happens outside his control.
[time=2765] There are times that things will happen in your life, maybe even today, that will confound you.
[time=2771] Where are you?
[time=2773] If you've almost asked that question, don't be afraid to ask that question of God.
[time=2776] Where are you?
[time=2777] God, where are you in my suffering, in my marriage with my kids?
[time=2781] Where are you?
[time=2786] I have prayed this story would bring to your mind powerfully that he is in the midst of all of it.
[time=2793] Somehow.
[time=2794] Let her be.
[time=2795] The Lord gives a place and a purpose.
[time=2798] There's a window in the ark at the top, so the ark is tricked out, we think.
[time=2802] There's a skylight in the ark.
[time=2804] Can I say that?
[time=2805] Did the ark is tricked out?
[time=2806] Is that my word to say that?
[time=2808] It's got like a moon roof in the ark.
[time=2811] God sends birds out.
[time=2813] A raven first, then a dove.
[time=2815] Raven gives him no comfort.
[time=2817] Ravens are unclean.
[time=2819] Dove gives him comfort.
[time=2821] Noah loves this bird.
[time=2822] I won't get into that, but he loves this bird.
[time=2824] Check it out in chapter eight.
[time=2825] He really does like it a lot like his pet almost.
[time=2827] The earth brings back an olive leaf.
[time=2831] Very interesting.
[time=2832] Beauty and fertility on display there.
[time=2835] Do you see how specific it is in verse 13?
[time=2838] Look at verse 13.
[time=2839] Chapter eight.
[time=2841] In the six hundred and first year, first month, first day of the month, the waters were dried
[time=2848] from off the earth.
[time=2849] This really did happen.
[time=2850] There was a lot of water and then it was gone.
[time=2852] An actual historical event.
[time=2854] Look at verse 17.
[time=2858] Bring out with you every living thing.
[time=2860] With you of all flesh, birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
[time=2868] They may swarm on the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.
[time=2872] It's a repeat of the command from Genesis 128.
[time=2874] Be fruitful and multiply.
[time=2879] God says go out.
[time=2881] So Noah went out.
[time=2885] He is obedient.
[time=2886] Profoundly obedient all throughout.
[time=2888] Why is he obedient?
[time=2889] Because God was gracious to him.
[time=2891] That's the order.
[time=2893] All friends, it's so important.
[time=2896] God will not look upon your obedience, be impressed with you and then give you salvation.
[time=2900] If that's your attitude toward God, then I want to talk you out of it as closely as I can.
[time=2905] Because you cannot merit the favor of God.
[time=2908] Your behavior matters tremendously before him.
[time=2913] But it will not merit his favor in your life.
[time=2917] That's the message of the Bible from back to Genesis 6 and 7 and 8.
[time=2921] We conclude this story.
[time=2923] It is a story.
[time=2924] It's a true story.
[time=2925] But it is a story.
[time=2927] Genesis 8, 23, 22.
[time=2929] I want to read this with you in conclusion.
[time=2934] The Lord's pleasure and promise.
[time=2937] As the stench of wickedness rises on the earth, God wipes it off with water.
[time=2943] Now Noah builds an altar to the Lord in verse 20 and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird
[time=2949] and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
[time=2951] And when the Lord smelled the pleasing aroma, the Lord said in his heart, remarkable verses.
[time=2959] I'll never again curse the ground because of man.
[time=2964] The putrid sense of wickedness that God smelled in Genesis 6 is replaced by the sweet smell of Noah's sacrifice.
[time=2970] The story begins and ends with grace, friends.
[time=2973] Watch this.
[time=2974] Don't miss this.
[time=2975] Look at verse 21.
[time=2979] I will never again curse the ground because of man.
[time=2983] 4 says the ESV.
[time=2985] The intention of man's heart is evil from his youth.
[time=2988] What does that mean?
[time=2989] 4.
[time=2990] That word 4 should be translated even though.
[time=2996] Read it again.
[time=2997] I will never again curse the ground because of man even though the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth.
[time=3004] The flood didn't change Noah's heart.
[time=3007] In his family, there's still crooked people.
[time=3010] He won't curse the ground even though man's heart is still continually evil.
[time=3014] The story begins and ends with grace.
[time=3017] Aren't you glad that you don't get what you deserve?
[time=3020] Are you glad for that this morning?
[time=3025] Oh, friends.
[time=3027] God is merciful.
[time=3029] The punishable will not be punished.
[time=3032] He won't do it.
[time=3035] As the band comes, we're going to conclude this morning with a hymn.
[time=3039] And I'll have some very quick applications for you.
[time=3043] Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done.
[time=3048] 822, while the earth remains, seed time and harvest, cold and heat,
[time=3054] summer and winter, day and night shall not cease.
[time=3060] God's faithfulness is great.
[time=3062] As you stand, let me read these verses to you from Isaiah 54.
[time=3067] This is like the days of Noah to me.
[time=3070] As I swore the waters of Noah would no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you
[time=3076] and will not rebuke you.
[time=3078] For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love will not depart from you.
[time=3083] And my covenant of peace will not be removed, says the Lord, who has compassion on you.
[time=3089] I pray, friends, that we would sing this hymn with the renewed sense of purpose because of who God is and what he has done.
[time=3096] Let's sing together.
[time=3098] Praise thy faithfulness, O God, my Father, there is no shadow turning with me.
[time=3120] Thou changest, not thy compassion's thee, fail not, as thou hast been, thou forever will be.
[time=3140] Sunburn and winter, springtime and part is, sunburn and stars, and their courses are burned.
[time=3156] You join with all nature and man, therefore it matters, to thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[time=3175] Praise thy faithfulness, Praise thy faithfulness, morning by morning.
[time=3187] Give mercy, sight of seeing, all I can need, live life and can grow by birth.
[time=3200] Praise thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[time=3245] Parton for sin and the peace that endure.
[time=3253] Thine own deep presence to you and to guide.
[time=3262] Straying for today and bright, oh, for tomorrow.
[time=3271] Well, sing so my little ten thousand besides.
[time=3279] Praise thy faithfulness, Praise thy faithfulness, morning by morning.
[time=3291] Give mercy, sight of seeing, all I have needed, live life and can grow by birth.
[time=3304] Praise thy faithfulness, Praise thy faithfulness.
[time=3321] Lord unto me.
[time=3331] In Matthew 24, Jesus says that as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming in the Son of Man.
[time=3337] And the passage lays out that not that Noah's days, they were evil, but that's not the point of the passage.
[time=3345] The point is it will happen when people are unaware.
[time=3348] Marrying, giving in marriage, maybe you're going to go wedding this summer.
[time=3353] Few of you will.
[time=3356] Are you ready for the Lord's return?
[time=3358] There will be signs for his return that have been going on for two thousand years.
[time=3363] They'll intensify in some way before the end, but are you ready is the question.
[time=3369] The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep you unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment.
[time=3375] That's from 1st, from 2nd Peter.
[time=3376] Secondly, this is either in your notes.
[time=3380] Just as the ark was a specifically ordered plan for the salvation of Noah and his family, so the cross is the specifically provided means of salvation of those who follow after Jesus.
[time=3391] The only way to be saved is to run to that cross, friends, to escape judgment, run to it, lastly.
[time=3399] God's faithfulness is great, amen.
[time=3402] Do you have your sins pardoned?
[time=3405] Do you have a peace that endures his dear presence to guide you?
[time=3410] These are questions that need answers, friends, and I pray that they are.
[time=3414] And if they're not, that you will run to him today as a good father who knows how to give good gifts to his children.
[time=3420] Let's pray as we dismiss.
[time=3422] Oh, great God, you are gracious.
[time=3426] You are just and you are faithful.
[time=3430] Lord, you have promised us that your son's return will happen.
[time=3434] Suddenly, they believe that in the church for 2,000 years, that we would be ready, that we would run to your only way to be saved to the cross of Christ.
[time=3445] And that we would leave here celebrating your faithfulness, our sins having been pardoned, our peace enduring.
[time=3452] And Lord, those that do not know you, they would run to Jesus who showed us how great your love was for us on that cross.
[time=3459] So, Lord, dismiss us now in your grace.
[time=3462] May we leave together our speech having been seasoned with these things from your word.
[time=3467] We thank you for speaking to us in Jesus' name.
[time=3469] We pray.
[time=3470] [AMEN]
