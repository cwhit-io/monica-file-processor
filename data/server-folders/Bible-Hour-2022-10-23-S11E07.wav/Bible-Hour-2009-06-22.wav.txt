[time=949] Hey, seven timeless stories.
[time=952] Seven timeless stories from the Book of Genesis.
[time=955] That's where we are this summer.
[time=957] Does God still work in anxious times?
[time=960] You know, we have a habit of putting people up on pedestals
[time=966] and then convincing ourselves that they'll never fall.
[time=970] We do this with sports figures, we do it with politicians, we do it with pastors, and just about everyone else in the public eye.
[time=977] We do it even, we do it with people in the Bible.
[time=980] We read the Bible and we come across really significant, important people, and we even begin to project that onto them, wanting them to somehow miraculously dwell above the fray that we ourselves exist in even today.
[time=996] But the Bible, my friends, the Bible that I read, as I study these pages and as I interact with this day after day, the Bible I read does not spare the disappointing details of fallen heroes.
[time=1011] And often, the Bible I read exposes their humanness, the humanness of those who we thought would stand with greater strength.
[time=1020] Let me ask you a question this morning as we start here.
[time=1022] Why do you think God does this?
[time=1025] Why do you think God gives us these glimpses into the frailty?
[time=1030] Why do you think God gives us these glimpses into the fallenness and the failure of those who once stood strong or those who we at least thought when given the opportunity would stand strong?
[time=1044] Be sure of this.
[time=1046] When human shortcomings are exposed in these pages, be sure of this.
[time=1052] It's not to sell copies, all right?
[time=1055] It's not to provide tantalizing drama.
[time=1058] Remember this, the Bible is first and foremost, God's self-revelation.
[time=1063] Do you understand this phrase?
[time=1066] The Bible is first and foremost, God's self-revelation.
[time=1071] It reveals God to you and I.
[time=1074] That's why we have the Scriptures to have this glimpse into most importantly Him, not us.
[time=1082] So when these sordid, disappointing details are brought forward, it's not for the sole purpose of presenting man's sinful failure, but to display God's interaction with that failure.
[time=1095] So we can learn more of the mind and character and heart of God and we're going to see this morning this very thing as we come to our third timeless story from the book of Genesis.
[time=1107] Genesis chapter 12 verses 10 to 16 is where we'll start.
[time=1111] Would you in honor of God's word stand and let me read this to you this morning.
[time=1115] Genesis 12 verses 10 to 16, we come to the story of Abram and Sarai in Egypt.
[time=1123] It says there in verse 10 now, "There was a famine in the land." So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was severe in the land.
[time=1133] It came about when he came near to Egypt that he said to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman." Well done, Abram, ladies, would you agree, say amen?
[time=1146] Guys, just try that out on the way home today.
[time=1149] Just look at her and say, "You know what? You're beautiful." And when the Egyptians see you, he says to Sarai, "They will say, this is his wife, and they will kill me, but they will let you live.
[time=1161] Please, Sarai, say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you and that I may live on account of you." And it came about when Abram came into Egypt.
[time=1170] The Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
[time=1173] Pharaoh's official saw her and praised her to Pharaoh.
[time=1177] You can imagine how that conversation went.
[time=1180] And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
[time=1184] You could replace the word house with harem.
[time=1189] Therefore, he treated Abram well for her sake, this brother of hers,
[time=1196] and gave him sheep, and oxen, and donkeys, and male and female servants, and female donkeys, and camels.
[time=1205] Genesis 12, 10 through 16.
[time=1208] Would you pray with me? God, we stand before you this morning, as we mentioned earlier, God expectant, and anticipating that your word
[time=1218] and the spirit of God that energizes your word, God would transform and change and convict and remind us today of this great truth.
[time=1227] Truth God that we need to hear, truth that we can hold on to, truth God that can make a difference in the everyday of our lives.
[time=1234] God, would you do that in us today? And we'll thank you for it.
[time=1238] In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1241] Amen. To many, to many, this passage is just a sad story of a godly man and woman gone bad.
[time=1250] It's just a weak, scared guy who lied and sacrificed his wife in the process.
[time=1260] People look at this, people read this, and they say, "Man, I cannot believe," I mean, of all guys, Abram, you know, that he would do this.
[time=1267] But there is, there is, as the NFL officials say,
[time=1273] after coming back from the booth, upon further review,
[time=1279] there is, I think, a much deeper, much more significant story line here.
[time=1286] And it is that much deeper and much more significant story line, way beyond fear and lying that I want you to see and that I want us together as a family this morning to lay hold of.
[time=1300] And so we'll attempt to do that in the remaining time.
[time=1304] By the way, this story this morning is for anyone who keeps making the same mistakes
[time=1310] over and over again.
[time=1313] Anybody in the room identify with that?
[time=1318] This story is for anybody in the room who keeps learning hard lessons the hard way.
[time=1328] This story is for anybody in the room this morning who marvels at times, at the patience of God with you and me as we walk this life so many times in desperate need of his grace and his love and forgiveness.
[time=1344] Anybody in the room appreciate that, say amen?
[time=1347] This story is for every one of us, my friends.
[time=1349] It begins with, and you can write this down, it begins with a disembodied voice.
[time=1354] That's right.
[time=1355] It begins with a disembodied voice.
[time=1357] The story actually begins in the first verse of chapter 12.
[time=1360] Go back to chapter 12 verses 1 to 3.
[time=1363] Now the Lord said to Abram, "Go forth from your country and from your relatives."
[time=1378] and from your father's house to the land which I will show you and will make you a great nation.
[time=1384] I will make you a great nation.
[time=1385] I will bless you.
[time=1386] I will make your name great.
[time=1388] So you shall be a blessing and I will bless those who bless you and the ones who curse you.
[time=1392] I will curse and in you, Abram, all the families of the earth will be blessed."
[time=1400] When you read that, you just kind of go, "Wow, that's kind of how that whole thing started." What you don't see and what you typically, me included with this, we typically don't understand is if you go back to 11, you go back to 10, you go back to 9.
[time=1413] There's no ongoing dialogue between God and Abram.
[time=1419] This is where it begins.
[time=1423] It's the first time he's ever in his life heard from this voice.
[time=1434] First time ever.
[time=1437] We'll come back to that.
[time=1438] One of the things I want you to notice here is the word usage.
[time=1441] The word used here in this passage is Jehovah, where it talks about this voice.
[time=1446] The Lord spoke to him.
[time=1447] Jehovah is the word used.
[time=1449] The Scriptures don't use Elohim or other words that could have been translated God for that wouldn't adequately infer what is actually happening here.
[time=1458] The word choice indicates that Abram hears the voice of Jehovah, God, but the voice he's hearing is of the majestic holy, separated, unbelievable God of all gods,
[time=1472] God of creation, God of the universe.
[time=1475] This isn't small G God, but capital God that has spoken to his heart and inner being.
[time=1480] Abram was convinced somehow, think about this.
[time=1483] He was convinced somehow in this one interaction with this disembodied voice that this personal great God, Jehovah of the universe was the real and only true God.
[time=1494] It's significant that Abram understood that it was Jehovah speaking to him because it demanded
[time=1501] that it was Jehovah, it demanded them that he respond to Jehovah's supreme authority
[time=1508] and Jehovah, the supreme authority said go and go he went.
[time=1514] He responded obediently, so Abram went forth.
[time=1518] As the Lord had spoken, you can see it right there in the text.
[time=1521] So Abram went forth, it says.
[time=1523] As the Lord had spoken to him and Lot went with him, now Abram was 75 years old when he departed from Huron.
[time=1531] In the Hebrew, I want you to note this, in the Hebrew it says there in that verse, "Hallek Havram," which are two words that tell an amazing story in and of themselves.
[time=1544] "Hallek Havram," Abram went.
[time=1549] Abram went.
[time=1552] Abram responds, Abram obeys.
[time=1555] Abram doesn't hesitate.
[time=1557] Abram went.
[time=1559] "Hallek Havram," it's an incredible insight.
[time=1562] Abram lived in the comfort and wealth of his father's house in the setting of Padan Aram, a great and flourishing region that was part of the Mesopotamian culture.
[time=1571] It was a culture that was affluent in that day.
[time=1574] There was no place on the face of the then known world that had it going on more than this place of Mesopotamia.
[time=1581] In November of 1975, he would be considered old by today's standards, but in his time it was common to live well beyond 150 years.
[time=1589] He himself lived to be 175.
[time=1593] So although he wasn't old by any means, he leaves the security of immense belongings
[time=1600] and status behind and sets out to follow the invitation, the wooing of a disembodied voice,
[time=1608] a voice he had never heard before.
[time=1614] He wasn't religious.
[time=1616] Did you know this?
[time=1618] Abram.
[time=1620] He wasn't religious.
[time=1622] He wasn't God-fearing.
[time=1625] He was a comfortable, wealthy pagan whose scripture tells us even worshiped the moon.
[time=1633] There's no backdrop.
[time=1635] There's no preparation.
[time=1637] There's no familiarity at all, just a voice.
[time=1642] In an obedience, he sets out for the land of promise and blessing.
[time=1648] So the God followed this now.
[time=1650] So the God of the universe made a promise and Abram set out to follow his voice by faith, but I want you to look at verse 10.
[time=1657] So he packs up everything he has, goes to a place that he does not know that God says he's going to reveal to him in time.
[time=1664] Off he goes and it says in verse 10, when he got there, there was a famine.
[time=1668] You see it there?
[time=1669] Now there was a famine in the land.
[time=1672] So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was what?
[time=1677] Say it.
[time=1678] Severe, the Hebrew word used to describe this particular famine.
[time=1683] In this instance is the word kabed, K-A-B-E-D.
[time=1687] Could have been two other words that he could have used to describe this famine for us.
[time=1692] This is this word, which means something very grievous, something heavy, extremely severe
[time=1698] and of great consequence to use kabed meant that this famine was an extremely grim situation.
[time=1705] Nothing was growing.
[time=1706] No rain was falling.
[time=1708] Cattle and people were dying.
[time=1710] Survival was absolutely impossible.
[time=1713] Okay, so you say, wait a minute.
[time=1717] Hang on here.
[time=1719] So where's the blessing?
[time=1722] You're Abram.
[time=1723] All right, you hear this voice.
[time=1725] You say, okay, I'm in.
[time=1727] You load up the camels.
[time=1728] You make this trek.
[time=1729] You get there and people in cattle are dying because there's absolutely nothing to drink or eat.
[time=1735] Where's this new land?
[time=1738] Where's this new life that you've promised?
[time=1741] God, did you bring me here to starve and die?
[time=1745] Why did I leave that to come and experience this?
[time=1750] You know, he's got to be sitting there thinking about this voice.
[time=1754] He has to begin to question what he was thinking.
[time=1760] Anybody in the room thinking may have been at this point confused.
[time=1763] Raise your hand.
[time=1765] All right.
[time=1767] Raise your hand if you've ever been confused by God.
[time=1773] All right, so most of us are still tracking here with the story.
[time=1777] Yeah?
[time=1778] All right, stay with me.
[time=1779] Stay with me.
[time=1780] Here's some cultural geographical insights I want you to see here.
[time=1786] We know if you read verses five to nine that Abram was living with his father's household in Haran.
[time=1792] Pandan oran would be the proper name for that region.
[time=1796] It's in northern Mesopotamia in obedience to God.
[time=1799] He headed eastward and then straight south toward the promised land, Canaan.
[time=1805] He stopped first in Shechem.
[time=1807] From there he traveled further southward building an altar between the towns of Bethel and I.
[time=1812] He continued his journey then toward the Negev, a wilderness region which borders with the desert of the Sinai Peninsula.
[time=1820] This region suffered from chronic periods of oppressive drought.
[time=1824] We know this about this place.
[time=1826] It's true, which resulted in the disastrous chain effect of people and livestock being left without a way to live or survive.
[time=1834] Because intense rains kept neighboring Egypt to the contrary, rich and fertile.
[time=1841] It was common, you learn this about it when you just study the history of this region and its people.
[time=1847] It was common in society, in that culture, for those inhabiting Canaan to travel to this land of plenty for temporary dwelling
[time=1859] as they waited for life-sustaining rains to return to their normally lush plains and plentiful plateaus.
[time=1870] Okay, quick question. We just read it kind of quickly. Maybe you've read it before. Did God?
[time=1878] Did I miss something? Did God tell him to go to Egypt?
[time=1884] Yes, no. No.
[time=1889] Did he pray about it?
[time=1895] Yes or no? No. All right.
[time=1903] How did he know to go to Egypt? Who told him to go to Egypt?
[time=1909] God or culture? Answer? Culture.
[time=1917] I just want you to think these things through with me here. What are you learning as we go through here? What are you learning about the real Abram at this point in his life?
[time=1929] Far from his home is wealthy affluent home in Haran and Canaan, the promised land has so far turned out to be not very what? Promising. What should he do? What would you do?
[time=1949] It's a real dilemma, the kind that we all find ourselves in from time to time. How many times have you faced a major, very confusing decision?
[time=1959] Really, really thought about it. Sawed advice, wrestled with the issues, made a decision that you thought was really good or they thought was really good, so you do it and off you go kind of in faith because you've got to believe if you came to that conclusion, God must be in it and then the result is
[time=1978] disastrous, just worse than you ever could have imagined. Many of you have lived that. Some of you are experiencing that even today. What do you do?
[time=1989] How do you navigate this? You'll see a slide here. When it seems God has thrown you a curve and it would certainly have seemed to Abram that God had thrown him a curve. What do you do?
[time=1999] Well, just quickly, there's a few options that we have. We can. He could have and we can in that situation become bitter. We can complain and get bitter. We can just kind of stand there and throw our hands up and say, "What in the world?"
[time=2011] You know, I was just trying to do the right thing. Thought it's what you wanted me to do. Why are you making me endure and experience this?
[time=2018] We can pack it all in and go home. There's no sign. I'll mention this. There's no sign of that in here, of him just loading up the camels and all the estate and going back to Dad's place, but oftentimes that's what we think or consider doing.
[time=2034] Thirdly, you could just man up and by man up, I mean, you know what? There are times when I think people get in that situation and they end up just kind of making something happen.
[time=2045] It's not inherently evil. It's not that it's bad, but it's just it's them. It's our response. They take a survey of the situation. They ask others around for advice. They dig down deep. They use their intellect, their experience, their maturity, and they figure out a way to survive.
[time=2062] And that is exactly. I want you to see this. That's exactly what Abram does. He had most certainly heard from the locals that during famines, the people of Canaan routinely traveled to Egypt to wait it out.
[time=2074] So that's his choice. He man's up. He puts a plan together. There's a fourth choice that he could have made.
[time=2083] There's a fourth choice there that you and I can make. You know what? We'll come back, okay? We'll come back to that fourth choice in a little bit.
[time=2091] Let's keep going. What you got to remember here, I want to say this to you just a couple of times in a couple of different ways just to make sure you hang on to this.
[time=2098] What you got to remember here is that this juncture, spiritually, at this juncture, the handling of this dilemma from a spiritual perspective wasn't even anywhere near being in Abram's playbook.
[time=2114] If you follow me there. It no spiritually, no clue. He saw what was going on here. He was new at this and like many of us believed based on God's promises.
[time=2128] This voice at least promises that great blessing was imminent because like us, he assumed that blessing came with doing the right thing.
[time=2137] And he heard the voice of Jehovah. He decided to obey that voice and felt like, man, right around the corner here. This is going to get really, really good.
[time=2146] Now as you also read the account and as you also take into account culture, it's clear that the prospect in Abram's mind of going into Egypt made Abram very nervous.
[time=2158] And rightly so, given Abram's wealth and the accumulated size of his estate, none of the other tribes within the region of Canaan had ever seen to him to be much of a threat, but now he's dealing with Egypt.
[time=2171] Now he's dealing with a completely different ballgame. This was a densely populated, sophisticated country with a foreign tongue, a prosperous people and a powerful, undisputed sovereign ruler whose name was Pharaoh.
[time=2187] Adam had great apprehension, excuse me, Abram, had great apprehension for the safety of himself and his wife as they prepared to enter Egyptian territory.
[time=2197] So here's what he did, Abram devised a plan. It came about, Genesis 12, 11 to 13, it came about when he came near to Egypt that he said to Sarah, his wife, see now I know that you are a beautiful woman, and when the Egyptians see you, they'll say, taker.
[time=2215] And they'll kill me, but they'll let you live, so he says, please say that you are my sister and lays out the plan.
[time=2222] Now we read that. Many of you have read that for years, and we read it again this morning, and there's something inside of us that reads that and goes, man!
[time=2234] What? Come on, Abram. Like what's he thinking? He's tossing his wife under the bus.
[time=2244] I mean, he's not just tossing her under the bus, compromising her very, very likely in a very intimate way, compromising his wife.
[time=2252] On top of that, you say he's lying, and this is Abram, and we just, we get so disappointed in him.
[time=2262] Sometimes we kind of wag our fingers at him in this story, and we say, shame on you. How could Abraham do this?
[time=2274] And I would just at this point remind you, just you could just take note of it here. He's not Abraham yet, is he?
[time=2285] He's still who? Had he ever heard the voice? Yes or no? No, never had. Some come to the conclusion that Abram should have just trusted God, and just said, you know what?
[time=2302] She is my wife. You're right. She's hot. I know it. You guys just do what you're going to do, and, well, we'll just deal with it.
[time=2310] I can't lie. I got to say it. Yep, she's my wife. But some think he should have trusted God more deeply, and just stayed in Canaan.
[time=2318] Yeah, it was bleak, but he should have just hunkered down, believed the promise of God.
[time=2325] And this is where hermeneutics, it's a big word with a really simple meeting, just the study, the interpretation of Scripture.
[time=2333] This is why it's so important that when we do hermeneutics, when we interpret the Bible, you've got to take into account some things.
[time=2341] You've got to take into account, yes, each verse, and you've got to take into account the grammar, and you've got to take into account the context of what's going on.
[time=2349] You also have to take into account the culture, and you have to take into account the story, the narrative, and where it started, and where it's going, the circumstances surrounding these things.
[time=2359] And when you take all of that into account, I think we can learn some things about Abram, and most importantly about the character and heart of God in this story that I think are worth learning.
[time=2371] Here's a few, you ready? Just jot these down. Abram, my friends, Abram was green, and by that I don't mean he recycled.
[time=2380] By that I mean he was spiritually, absolutely, and completely immature.
[time=2386] Ten generations had passed between Abram and Noah.
[time=2390] Did you realize this? So he had no real framework at all, or reference point for this disembodied voice that he had followed.
[time=2398] He had no book of Bible stories to glean wisdom from, and thereby grow from the experience of others who had gone before him.
[time=2406] He didn't have centuries of recorded church history and volumes of expository preaching literature to pour through for answers.
[time=2413] There was no 24/7 Christian radio, no small group to attend. Get nothing to fall back on, but a new voice and a promise.
[time=2423] And up to this point, the promise wasn't going very well. Would you agree? Agreed.
[time=2430] You read it, you think about it, and you begin to get this picture of who Abram really was, and you think, my goodness, if only he had had the privilege of growing up Jewish.
[time=2442] If only he had had the privilege of growing up in the family of God, if only he had had the privilege of being taught what all Jewish young men would have known.
[time=2450] Proverbs 3-5, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding."
[time=2463] Would have been useful, wouldn't it?
[time=2467] Abram was green. Write this down, Abram was shrewd. He really was. Abram had a worldly sense about him.
[time=2475] He had already proven to be a good leader, a sophisticated man. He understood people and was very experienced and very intuitive.
[time=2482] We can see from the verses that follow this passage that Abram's intuitive assessment of the situation there in Egypt was absolutely right on the money.
[time=2492] The Egyptians responded just as he knew they would, verse 15, Pharaoh's official saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's harem.
[time=2506] Now, a note here on this, you might want to just make note of this, his worldly wisdom, my friends, his shrewdness, his street smarts, would have also allowed him to know that in that culture, in that day,
[time=2521] because of the way this harem thing worked, it took a year. Did you know this? It took a year for a new harem member to be indoctrinated, prepared, and readied for her first trip to the Pharaoh's bed.
[time=2543] So he knows this. He shrewd. He's just flying by the seat of his pants here. This is all very new. He's trying to get through it.
[time=2554] You know what else? Abram was actually half truthful. Did you understand this? Have you ever looked at Genesis 20? I think it's Genesis 2012.
[time=2564] Sarah was a sister. Sarah was his half sister. In Genesis 2012, this all comes out, and you know, it was the daughter of my father, Tara, but not the daughter of my mother.
[time=2581] And she became my wife, Genesis 2012. And I just mentioned that to you, because it wasn't like he just pulled it out of nowhere.
[time=2588] It wasn't just this pathological dude that just kind of pulled it out of the sky. She was his half sister.
[time=2599] He's spiritually immature. He's street smart. Now he's bending the truth a little. And you might want to write this down. He was also very realistic.
[time=2608] He was very pragmatic. Abram was realistic. Abram knew Egypt wasn't an arbitrary monarchy where anything goes.
[time=2615] All predicated upon the whim of a single ruler whose wishes were absolute. Boom. Pharaoh wished it. Pharaoh got it.
[time=2624] Clearly the unbridled passion and judgment of a single unchecked ruler could prove to be in his case and Sarah's case.
[time=2631] If he wasn't smart, inconvenient, even deadly. So it's survival time for this young man of 75.
[time=2640] He's facing a formidable, scary opponent. What would you do? How would you respond? He's green, he's shrewd, he's truth bending, and extremely practical.
[time=2652] And this is where it gets extremely interesting. Genesis 12, 14 to 20, it came about when Abram came into Egypt.
[time=2659] The Egyptians saw that the woman was beautiful. They go through that whole scene where they take her. She goes into the Pharaoh's home.
[time=2669] He treated Abraham well, sheep and ox and donkeys. We've read that, but look at that. But the Lord, after all that takes place, but the Lord struck Pharaoh.
[time=2678] The Lord struck who? The Lord didn't strike Abram. Who messed up here? Abram? Who does the Lord strike? Pharaoh. The Lord strikes Pharaoh.
[time=2689] Remember the Bible. The Bible is the self-revelation of God's character and God's heart for his people.
[time=2698] But the Lord struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai. Abram's wife. Then Pharaoh called Abram. We don't know how it all came out.
[time=2706] But it ends up with Pharaoh calling Abram and saying, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me the truth?
[time=2712] Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? Why did you say she's my sister so that I took her for my wife?"
[time=2718] Now then here, here's your wife back. Take her and go. Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they escorted him away with his wife and all that belonged to him.
[time=2729] Everything Pharaoh had given him. He just says, "Keep it and get out of here." Genesis 12, 14 to 20.
[time=2739] Now remember, I just said it to you. I'm going to say it to you again. The Bible is first and foremost. God's self-revelation.
[time=2749] Whenever you and I have the privilege of opening up the pages of God's Word, we have this amazing opportunity to see and learn more about the mind and character and heart of God for his people.
[time=2762] And that is exactly what's happening here. We're watching Abram in his spiritual infancy being raised up by God. This is what we're watching. This is what we're encountering in this story.
[time=2775] God at this juncture is teaching and God is growing like he teaches and grows you. He's teaching and growing Abram through this process over time.
[time=2788] Do you, some of you know this, some of you don't. Do you realize in chapter 20, just, you know, eight chapters later that he's traveling years later, chapters later, do you realize he's traveling with Sarai again?
[time=2808] And this time he comes upon Abimelech, King of the Philistines, not Pharaoh, now it's Abimelech, and he gets scared and he tells Sarah, tell him you're my what?
[time=2823] He does it again.
[time=2828] This message is for anybody who continues to struggle with doing the same things again and again and again. Remember I said that? He does it again.
[time=2839] And again, you got to read it. Read it tonight. Go to Genesis 20. God intervenes, brings judgment on Abimelech, blesses Abram, saves the day and moves him down the road.
[time=2855] He goes to Egypt on his own, God didn't say go to Egypt, throws his wife under the bus twice, and God just keeps growing him.
[time=2868] This type of slow, listen, this type of slow learning process, this gradual sanctification if you will over time, where the mercy and grace and love of God patiently communicates to the struggling fallen soul is what develops godly character, and in time builds up our muscles of faith.
[time=2895] Can I say it that way? Our muscles of faith. Okay, here it is. Last 35 minutes all comes right here.
[time=2909] So did this process work with Abram? Did Abram ever really develop after years and years and years of failing at the very same thing and other failures that we don't have time to get to? Did he ever develop muscles of faith?
[time=2931] Can it ever, can it ever work in your life? Do you think, do you believe today, do you have any hope that at some point in your life and your journey with him that your fear, the fear in you that leads you and prompts you toward multiple experiences of disobedience and lack of trust and independence from God is there.
[time=2956] Any hope at all for you that your fear can someday be overcome by a great strong faith.
[time=2969] Will you ever learn to trust God deeply and stop doing your own thing?
[time=2980] Okay, remember I told you that there was a fourth option back on the what do you do when God throws you a curve?
[time=2990] There is a fourth option and simply stated it's called trust God.
[time=2998] Trust God and reminds me of the song I used to sing as a little kid in the pew next to my mom. Trust and what? Trust and obey.
[time=3005] That's a fourth option, my friends. The fourth choice is a result of seasoned experience with God.
[time=3013] It comes when somebody has watched God over time again and again and again and again show his faithfulness and goodness.
[time=3023] It comes when someone has seen again and again and again that when you trust him there's great blessing and promise and that when you don't you're left on your own and it's not a place you want to be.
[time=3034] It comes when over time someone sees and realizes they begin to know not just know cognitively but but Oida know down deep inside in one's heart and soul that God is faithful.
[time=3047] In this mode of trusting and obeying you see we're able to remain within the confines of God's promises and trust him to work things out even when it looks bleak even when you know Pharaoh's guys are going to take her.
[time=3063] Even when you know there's no food to eat I got to go somewhere even when you know your marriage is hopeless.
[time=3074] Even when you know there's just no way that addiction can be conquered even when you know that you just got to have that new whatever.
[time=3087] No no no there's this fourth choice where we go you know what I'm going to do the right thing and I'm going to trust God in a deep and profound way.
[time=3099] Watch this this was like this was like goose bump time for me this week.
[time=3106] We know for a fact I asked you earlier do you think it ever worked with Abram a guy just like you and me.
[time=3114] We know for a fact that it did that it did that that indeed there was developed within Abram this great faith and we know it because of what we saw him do years later with his only son Isaac go to Genesis 22 real quick.
[time=3133] Genesis 22 did it ever work pages chapters years years later Genesis 22 verses 1 and 2 hold on it's just going to thrill your heart blow you away all at the same time.
[time=3149] Now it came about after these things that God tested Abraham now he's Abraham and he said here I am.
[time=3160] He said Abraham and Abraham said here I am take now your son God said take now your son your only son whom you love Isaac and go to the land of Mariah and offer him there as a burnt offering
[time=3178] on one of the mountains of which I will tell you Abraham this is God I want you to go to Mariah and kill your son go to verse 7 amazing interaction between the two.
[time=3197] Here's something for you to hang on to most of our Bible stories most of our flannel graphs that we do with our kids on this show Isaac you know beat about 10 11 12 years old.
[time=3208] Hey daddy Isaac was probably in his early 20s when this happened I say that to you not only because of just the sheer magnitude of what it reveals but it also tells you a little bit about the faith that had been developed and who in Isaac.
[time=3226] Verse 7 Isaac spoke to Abraham his father said my father and he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but father where is the lamb for the burnt offering.
[time=3243] And Abraham said here it is Abraham said read it with me out loud God will provide.
[time=3253] God will provide for himself the lamb for the burnt offering my son so the two of them walked on together then they came to the place of which God had told him and Abraham built the altar.
[time=3267] There is no pleading there is no plan B there is no alternative course there is no going to Egypt there is no hey she's my sister.
[time=3279] Abraham built the altar arrange the wood bound his son and laid him on the altar on top of the wood Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
[time=3296] Same guy same man just years later just over the season of time just through the experiences of life just through failure after failure after failure.
[time=3317] And God's character revealed God's faithfulness and God's patience and dedication to grow him same guy unspeakable faith through lessons learned.
[time=3331] God still work in anxious times absolutely he's still doing this very thing in you you know why because my friends as I told you in week one he's been doing it from the very beginning.
[time=3345] And what we learn about the character of God in his word is that what he did then he does now because he doesn't change and his love for you is as deep as his love for Abraham who became Abraham who are you going to become.
[time=3360] Oh that Abraham had known Proverbs three five oh that you and I would know Proverbs three six.
[time=3368] Five trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding verse six but in all your ways acknowledge who have faith in who trust who in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths what say it.
[time=3388] Straight would you stand and let's pray.
[time=3392] Oh Father in heaven we are a people today who are so thankful that you continue to make very crooked detoured paths straight once again.
[time=3405] Oh God we're thankful that as we read your word this morning we're reminded that the revelation of God that the revelation of you and your heart and your character is one that reminds us of your great patience.
[time=3417] Your commitment to a process.
[time=3420] God we're so glad you didn't and don't wag your finger in Abram's face.
[time=3425] So thankful God that you stayed faithful to grow him and nurture him and develop him into the man of the man of faith.
[time=3435] The Bible refers to him as a man of faith who was a friend of yours.
[time=3442] And oh God we long to be your friend we long to be people of faith great strength and character and integrity.
[time=3451] And oh God I pray that we would choose option four.
[time=3454] I pray again and again today and tomorrow and this week that we would be a people who choose to trust and obey for there is no other way.
[time=3463] God we're grateful for this story we look forward to more stories from this amazing book of Genesis.
[time=3469] We're thankful that you're a God who still works in anxious times and all the people were thankful and they agreed and said with one voice.
[time=3477] Amen God bless you we'll see you next week.
