[time=30] [MUSIC - 40 seconds]
[time=74] One more time.
[time=76] [MUSIC - 7 seconds]
[time=88] - Couple minutes here, just to keep sharing with you,
[time=96] some things that just continue to be on my heart, the heart of our leaders, we kind of just in our planning, we're just calling these little vision talks, but really it's just a chance to stay current and up to speed with where God is leading us and the things that we're learning in the process about this ministry and its future.
[time=116] Last week I read to you, I kind of said to you a statement, that statement's on the screen right now.
[time=122] We really are excited about the fact that God is actually leading us, we believe these days in this direction, we are becoming more and more so, my friends, a diverse community of disciples, lot of differences in this room, even this morning, lot of differences in this family, and we want to be a diverse community of disciples, Jesus imitators, as it says, whose personal, financial and cultural differences disappear in our genuine love for each other and our mutual commitment to follow our King, amen?
[time=158] I wanna draw your attention to just one of those phrases up there, and I wanna take that phrase and just make a real simple connection to our church and how we'll do ministry in the future.
[time=169] There's a phrase up there, Jesus imitators.
[time=173] And let me ask you this question, it'll be on the screen, how will, how will we in the days to come approach ministry at Black Hawk in a way that imitates Jesus?
[time=185] I want you to think about this.
[time=187] If we wanna be a diverse community of disciples, Jesus imitators, how will we beat Jesus imitators in the way we approach ministry across the board?
[time=197] As churches today think about this and consider this, I wanna just tell you, there's a couple of options out there and both are okay, I'm not standing here today necessarily saying that one is wrong and sinful and one is good and godly.
[time=212] Two common options though, that many churches today consider.
[time=217] Attractional would be one approach.
[time=221] Incarnational, I'll explain it in a moment, incarnational would be another approach.
[time=227] Let's talk about that first one just for a moment.
[time=231] Attractional approaches to ministry are those which basically adopt the if we build it, they will come philosophy.
[time=239] These churches are oftentimes known for their amazing Christmas concerts, they're on-campus coffee shop, they're climbing wall, they're sports leagues, impressive facilities and more.
[time=250] Now, real quick, is there anything inherently wrong with any of those things?
[time=254] Yes or no?
[time=256] Nothing wrong at all with any of them.
[time=259] All right, you hear me?
[time=260] Nothing wrong with those things.
[time=261] The idea that drives this approach oftentimes is that if you can just get people in the what?
[time=268] If you can just get people in the door as you offer these things and give them these things, if you can just get people in the door then you can most definitely what?
[time=279] You grow your church, you keep people as you give yourself to this attractional approach.
[time=286] Now, there's the other side of the coin though, watch.
[time=289] What Blackhawk is really, I believe, moving toward.
[time=293] God has given us great peace about this and great excitement for this picture.
[time=298] What Blackhawk is moving toward in recent days is a more incarnational approach.
[time=303] What do we mean by incarnational?
[time=305] Instead of doing ministry on the basis of getting people to come to us, we long to be a church that takes its ministry to them.
[time=316] Not one for one and not 100% you get what I'm saying but then it becomes not so much them coming to us but it becomes about us.
[time=324] Blackhawk Ministries is really about Blackhawk's ministers.
[time=328] It's about you and me in the everyday of life being willing to go as a priest and pass him along to those in your workplace and those in your neighborhood and those in your family and those in your world.
[time=340] Not so much them to us but us to them.
[time=343] Just like the Son of God, here's where it's incarnational.
[time=346] Just like the Son of God who left his heavenly home to dwell among those he came to love.
[time=352] We want to be known for our willingness to take the gospel out from within the walls of our building to affect the lives of those we come in contact with.
[time=362] Does that make sense?
[time=364] While we'll continue to gather, I think the next one, yeah, while we'll continue to place great value and priority on the gathering because first century Jesus followers did as well, while we'll continue to place great priority on the gathering and we'll be thankful for those who come and join us for everybody who calls Blackhawk home.
[time=386] Everybody who calls Blackhawk Ministries home, we will implore you as priests.
[time=393] To live as reflectors of God and his attributes to those in your world.
[time=400] And that, that is the basis, that is the strength, that is the bulk of what we're gonna do.
[time=407] We're going to be people who live out the gospel in the everyday of our lives.
[time=414] Blackhawk Ministries, in every each and every setting, consumed with taking it to them so that they can see and understand through the way you and I live our lives.
[time=426] [AMEN] Two approaches, one that we feel very, very grateful to be kind of led toward.
[time=432] One caution, look at this.
[time=433] Attractional approaches can, they don't always, but attractional approaches where we try and get them in the door by doing the big deal.
[time=441] Attractional approaches have a way of growing up consumers 'cause they get used to having the big deal.
[time=450] They get used to you as leadership providing all this stuff and so they bring the people and the people come and sit and take it in.
[time=457] Attractional approaches can tend to develop consumers while the incarnational approach can tend to produce disciples who understand that it is our place to not sit and so much receive, but to sit, have it deposited in us so that we can go and make a difference.
[time=479] And boy, is there, thank you, amen, back to you.
[time=481] And boy, is there a great opportunity in this world, my friends, to go and make a difference.
[time=487] We're gonna hear more about that here.
[time=490] As we continue in our worship and I just pray to God that he'll continue to grow this vision and this picture of ministry in your heart and mind in the days to come.
[time=498] - In the summer we've been talking about these stories from Genesis that remind us about anxious times and how God is so faithful in the midst of those.
[time=508] This morning I'm really thankful that my sister, Key is here and she's just saying that last song and just thankful for her and she's gonna share with you this morning in my request a story about her husband and her and an anxious time that they went through about four years ago.
[time=524] And I think it's so important for us in the midst of our unknown circumstances to hear stories not only from Genesis, but from our friends and our brothers and sisters in Christ about God's faithfulness in the midst of unknown circumstances.
[time=538] Key, why don't you share with them?
[time=539] - Sure, exactly four years ago like Corbin said, Josh and I, my husband, found ourselves in the midst of the greatest hardship we've ever faced when our sons Levi and Silas, our twin boys, were born three months early.
[time=557] I was 28 weeks pregnant and completely surprised
[time=564] being rushed down by a helicopter, two and a half hours from where we lived to a hospital where I gave birth to the twins.
[time=575] At the time of their birth they weighed two and a half pounds and I actually brought, this is the size of the diaper that they wore when they were in the intensive care unit for infants and we actually had to roll this like two times just to get it to fit around their waist.
[time=594] There were so many hardships involved in their early delivery.
[time=599] For one, our oldest son, Samuel, who's now five, was 13 months old and obviously needed caring for and as I said earlier, I was life-lighted down to a hospital that was two and a half hours away from my home, our home and that was just really
[time=619] a difficult situation having to juggle being with the twins and being there for my husband and for our 13-month-old and one incident really stands out to me as just a pivotal point in the journey.
[time=636] It was the very first time after I was discharged from the hospital.
[time=641] It was the first time we had to get in our van and drive away from the hospital and leave the babies there, leave Levi and Silas at the hospital and I was just completely overwhelmed with the idea of what would happen in our absence.
[time=661] We didn't know if they would be breathing through the night.
[time=664] We didn't know if they would run into any issues with infection.
[time=669] There were so many things that could have gone wrong and I was just overcome with fear with at times anger thinking about why is this happening
[time=680] and just a heartache, it was so painful to go through the experience and in that moment God had taken every security that we had, everything that we clung to and we knew to make things okay and he had stripped that away from us.
[time=697] He had taken that from us and he was calling us to a place where we had to trust him in a way that we never had before.
[time=706] And I remember praying and just telling God no matter what happens to Levi and what, no matter what happens to Silas, I commit them to you and I know that you are a good God.
[time=724] And no matter what the future holds, I'm still gonna love you and I'm still gonna serve you and you will always be my God.
[time=732] And that was a major point where I just realized this is faith, this is believing, this is trusting.
[time=741] It seems easy to do sometimes when things are going right but this was just such a hard experience.
[time=748] And God in that moment of brokenness and surrender, God sent such a peace over me and he let me know as much as you care for your twins, I care for you so much more and you can trust me with this burden.
[time=762] And he was so good and so faith through that time.
[time=768] And I am happy to tell you, I'd like to invite the twins to come up right now that we celebrated the twins fourth birthday.
[time=776] (audience applauding) Come on up guys.
[time=779] They're now four, they turned four this Thursday.
[time=787] They're energetic, active little boys.
[time=791] You would never know that they ever spent any time in the hospital.
[time=794] But we've seen God's mighty hand at work and I just wanna encourage you, if you're facing any uncertainties in your life, if you are struggling asking questions, is God listening, does he know what I'm going through?
[time=810] Does he care?
[time=812] My answer for you this morning is yes.
[time=815] If you cling to Jesus, just look at what he can do.
[time=820] See his power and his mighty hand at work.
[time=823] (audience applauding)
[time=829] (upbeat music)
[time=849] [MUSIC - 108 seconds]
[time=962] - All my life.
[time=964] [MUSIC - 69 seconds]
[time=1038] (upbeat music)
[time=1049] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=1069] (upbeat music)
[time=1078] - You know, as Corbin plays, let me just ask you this.
[time=1083] One of the amazing things, one of the great gifts that God gives me as a pastor and a shepherd in a local church is that over the years, you know, I get to experience and walk through life with so many of you.
[time=1096] And I wondered if we could just take a moment and celebrate God's goodness.
[time=1100] If you have in your life and journey with him, you've experienced the goodness of God in a time and in a setting where it was just unspeakably tough for you.
[time=1117] I mean, it just was confusing and it was painful and you found yourself thinking, I don't know if I can get through this.
[time=1124] And whether you were young or old and whether it had to do with a job or a family member, if there was a time in your life where like key, listen, you knew, you knew God was good.
[time=1137] You knew that God would be faithful.
[time=1141] It was so difficult, but you knew you could trust him.
[time=1145] I want you just to stand up quietly, just slip up.
[time=1148] Wow.
[time=1152] Yeah.
[time=1154] And I just want you to look around the room and I just want you to be so encouraged by the fact that so many in this room have known the goodness of God, the faithfulness of God.
[time=1166] Father God, I'm grateful for those who stand here today
[time=1172] and we're thankful as a family for the fact that we know you and we know even in dark times that don't make sense, your faithfulness endures.
[time=1182] And we thank you for the chance to celebrate that today.
[time=1184] We thank you God that we can stand again next week, next month there will be new situations that will stretch our knowledge of you.
[time=1193] We pray God for the strength to rest, to trust and obey.
[time=1198] In your name we pray, amen.
[time=1201] Everybody say amen.
[time=1203] Amen, you can be seated.
[time=1204] Thank you.
[time=1205] Thanks Corbin, thank you Key.
[time=1208] I want to thank Kerry Burton.
[time=1209] That was some of you, I don't know Kerry's, you know Kerry's new last name, Davidson.
[time=1216] Kerry used to be a part of our family.
[time=1218] Some of you may recognize Kerry.
[time=1219] Kerry Davidson now lives in Marion, but she came back and was willing to sing this morning and we're thankful for Corbin and the band and those gals using their gifts.
[time=1229] And it's good to be, good to be together.
[time=1231] Would you open your Bibles to Genesis 22?
[time=1233] Genesis chapter 22, as most of you know, we've been enjoying a summer series here on Sunday mornings.
[time=1242] Some timeless stories from the book of Genesis, asking and answering the question, is God still at work in anxious times?
[time=1251] It says in Genesis 22, my friends, we alluded to this at the conclusion of our time together last week.
[time=1257] Now we come back today to kind of take another fuller view of this amazing situation that unfolds here in the 22nd chapter of Genesis between Abraham and Jehovah God.
[time=1270] Now it came about, it says, after these things, verse one, Genesis 22, now it came about after these things, but God tested Abraham and said to him, Abraham, and he said, here I am.
[time=1284] He said, take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Mariah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.
[time=1299] Hey, I want to stop right here and I want to just invite you to take a few minutes with me here at the beginning.
[time=1305] I want to just get you to think about how it is we come to the Scriptures.
[time=1310] How it is we view these kinds of narratives
[time=1316] and interactions between God and man, I want to talk to you just for a moment as we start out today about how we as a family and how you individually actually view an opportunity to read and study God's Word.
[time=1329] And here's how I want to kind of come at it with you this morning.
[time=1332] I want you to think for a moment about a backstage pass.
[time=1336] Anybody ever had one?
[time=1338] Anybody ever had a backstage pass?
[time=1341] It's a great adventure, an eye-opening experience to be allowed behind the scenes of a major event.
[time=1348] Maybe it was a concert.
[time=1350] I used to work security.
[time=1351] When I was in school as a 20-year-old, they'd let basketball players work security at major concerts at the venue there at the university.
[time=1359] I attended a song, unbelievable things.
[time=1361] It was quite an experience.
[time=1364] When you're backstage, a lot happens, although seamless to a general spectator filing into their seat in the auditorium, there is always a flurry of involvement backstage from this backstage vantage point.
[time=1377] Lights, camera, action, logistics dominate the landscape and you quickly become privy to the multitude of activities being hidden from the audience by design.
[time=1387] With any event of this nature, and here's a couple of words I want you to write down and think about, with any event of this nature as a member of the audience spectator, right, we are what we'll call this morning experiential receivers.
[time=1403] There's the first word I want you to have in your mind today as we think about how we come to the scriptures.
[time=1408] As a member of the audience, we are experiential receivers, general consumers, spectators who enjoy and follow along willingly with each twist and turn of the plot.
[time=1420] We have no idea where it's going, but we'll sit, watch, listen in our seat and enjoy the ride as a spectator.
[time=1428] But if you're backstage, if you're behind the scenes, we are witnesses, witnesses.
[time=1437] We see from our backstage vantage point that there is a predetermined plan behind the plot and that the plan is based on the vision of the director and when backstage, we see that everything is put into place and carefully orchestrated by the director to create and present this event, this play, this concert, this game.
[time=1464] Well, now that we've been backstage, any time you get a view of what's really going on and why it's going on and what its purpose is, the outcome of the event almost takes a back row seat to our fascination with the process and planning which has occurred behind the curtain.
[time=1484] As I was thinking about this this week, I came across a writing actually done by a friend of mine.
[time=1491] And as I read this writing, I realized it was exactly what we're talking about here when we think about receivers and witnesses and vantage points and spectators and being behind the scenes.
[time=1503] And I want to just read this to you.
[time=1504] I thought it was extremely well written and just fascinating and very applicable.
[time=1508] In the city of London with a quick glance in the direction of the palace of Westminster, you will easily spot the Big Ben clock tower.
[time=1518] In addition to providing the practical function of telling time as a grand neo-gothic architectural gem this world famous tourist attraction inspires the masses in the same way all forms of art have through the ages, greatness begets greatness and moves men to accomplish more.
[time=1534] As the largest forefaced chiming clock in the world, did you know that?
[time=1541] The largest forefaced chiming clock in the world, it peels across the city in a perfect quarter hour pattern with an earshot its metronome melody urges city dwellers from their hectic life toward the grounding of its regular unchanging tempo.
[time=1557] It hums of a higher timing and a steady enduring hand at the wheel but to see it in its fullness, we must climb the Parliament tower.
[time=1568] For behind the great face of this timepiece is the watchmaker's design at work created in 1854.
[time=1577] The face of the clock is 23 feet in diameter.
[time=1580] The hour hand is nine feet long and the minute hand is 14 feet long.
[time=1586] Its designer invented a revolutionary escapement mechanism, a device, listen, a device that converts the rotational motion of gears into the back and forth motion of a pendulum.
[time=1602] To fine tune Big Ben's pendulum, the designer placed a small stack of old penny coins,
[time=1611] adding or subtracting individual coins has the effect of minutely altering the position of the pendulum's center mass, therefore altering the rate at which the pendulum swings.
[time=1624] So precise is this process that by adding or removing a single penny, the clock's speed will change by 4/10 of a second per day.
[time=1637] This penny method is still used to this very day, to this very hour to manage the accuracy of this timepiece.
[time=1647] OK, receivers, receivers from London's city sidewalks
[time=1657] or even out in the suburbs within hearing distance, we are experiential receivers.
[time=1662] As general consumers or spectators, we can take advantage of Big Ben's ability to tell us what time it is.
[time=1668] Moving a step further, we can enjoy the grandeur of its architectural design and take inspiration from its beauty, its symbolism, and its longevity.
[time=1678] But as witnesses, behind the scenes,
[time=1685] on the stairway landing built with beams hewn from trees that grew centuries ago, we can be witnesses.
[time=1693] We can see there behind the great face the intricacy of the design and marvel at the precision with which it continues to operate.
[time=1701] We are humbled by the genius of the watchmaker.
[time=1704] We marvel at the complexity and are thrilled with the beauty of the design.
[time=1708] Here in the tower behind the scenes, we have forgotten what time it actually is as we bask in the thrill and enlightenment of an inside look.
[time=1721] My friends, what God's word teaches us and what we'll see again today in our fourth story.
[time=1728] In this list of seven timeless stories from the book of Genesis is that on a spiritual level, don't miss this, on a spiritual level, we stand in awe of the watchmaker's perfect design, how carefully and how perfectly God manages, not only the millenniums, but our lives as well, within the scope of a limitless universe.
[time=1751] He shifts us again and again toward true center and one penny at a time, one alteration at a time, one day after another with his divine hand.
[time=1767] He is never late.
[time=1769] His design will not fail, never has, never will.
[time=1775] And he will always produce his perfect results in his perfect time.
[time=1780] And this we see from our behind the scenes look.
[time=1785] That's how I want us to view the scriptures.
[time=1787] The scriptures give us this opportunity to look behind the scenes at stories and in that look we find all kinds of insights.
[time=1795] So today we're witnesses.
[time=1798] Today you get an inside look at an amazing story that on the surface sometimes gets viewed and interpreted a certain way this morning we get a chance to look.
[time=1808] So go back to Genesis 22, if you will, and we'll begin there and our text, tempted or tested is where we'll begin.
[time=1816] The passage begins.
[time=1817] Now it came about after these things.
[time=1820] First line, first verse, chapter 22.
[time=1822] You see it there?
[time=1823] And I want to stop right there.
[time=1824] Now it came about after these things.
[time=1827] So what things, when you read that, your mind like mine might go to okay, what things are we talking about?
[time=1832] And it's a very important question.
[time=1834] It helps set the context for this story.
[time=1836] What things are we talking about?
[time=1839] Well, the timeframe, my friends, for our passage here in Genesis 22 is really the 50 years.
[time=1847] You can just jot that down.
[time=1848] The 50 years that have passed since Abram left Heron and took off after the promised land that an audible only God had promised would be his.
[time=1861] So after 50 years, imagine this, after 50 years of walking with God, after 50 years of experiences with God, after 50 years of God leading and directing and showing and teaching and working with Abraham, all the lessons, all the maturity gained, we are told God tested Abraham.
[time=1884] My friends, God does this with His people.
[time=1889] God did this with Abraham.
[time=1891] I'm so thankful for the chance that you and I have to look at this today because my friends, God does this with you.
[time=1897] God does this with me, God tested Abraham.
[time=1901] Now some translations use the word tempted, which is unfortunate, not let me explain that to you.
[time=1907] And it's the most important word in the passage, by the way.
[time=1910] So you gotta understand the usage of this one word for this whole thing to really make sense.
[time=1918] In the Hebrew, the word for tested was nasa, N-A-S-A-H, when they translated the Hebrew Old Testament to the Greek New Testament, the translators gave it the name perazzo, P-E-I-R-A-Z-O, perazzo, which means to try, whether a thing can be done, to attempt and to endeavor to test.
[time=1941] And it's important to note that in the Greek, there is a positive usage of perazzo and there is a negative usage of perazzo.
[time=1949] The negative usage, you could look at James 113.
[time=1954] You can turn back there if you want.
[time=1956] Look at James 113.
[time=1958] This would be a negative usage of the word perazzo.
[time=1961] It says there, and here it's talking about tempting, not so much testing.
[time=1967] Let no one say when he is perazzoed.
[time=1970] Let no one say when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself does not what?
[time=1977] Tempt, he himself does not perazzo.
[time=1980] Perazzo in the negative sense has a totally different intent.
[time=1983] With the negative usage, the initiator desires the one being tested to fail.
[time=1990] The purpose with the negative usage is to stumble someone and watch him or her fall.
[time=1997] This is how, by the way, this is how Satan works.
[time=2001] Satan is known as the great what?
[time=2003] The great tempter.
[time=2004] Perazzo in the negative sense, without exception, without exception, every time Satan is involved in the perazzo or testing process, the test is designed to trip up and harm.
[time=2018] On the other hand, I love this, on the other hand, however, every time God is involved in the testing, it is not to incite one to sin, fall, or fail, but to try, this is what he does with you, this is what he does with me, when he tests us, when he perazzos us, he tries us, or proves one's character, attempts to give an occasion for the development of one's faith.
[time=2045] When you see test and you see God, the purpose is always to examine the believer's attitude and initiate a learning process in order to bring us more into conformity with God.
[time=2059] Here in Genesis 22, we have the positive usage.
[time=2063] God wanting not to tempt Abraham, but to prove and test what level of trust and faith was really there in Abraham's heart.
[time=2073] And really, with the magnitude of this test, we move more accurately to an exam.
[time=2080] That's a biggie.
[time=2082] There's just a test, this is an exam.
[time=2085] From tests to exam, and this is where my friends, this is where you get the privilege, and I get the privilege as we make our way through the text of really moving back behind the ropes, getting back behind the curtain.
[time=2096] This is where you and I get this inside backstage look.
[time=2100] As we mentioned earlier, in this context, because of the use of perazzo, God was providing an opportunity to examine the level of commitment that Abraham possessed.
[time=2114] This isn't God being mean.
[time=2119] We know that the director, if you will, okay, we're backstage.
[time=2123] We know that the director, God, had been working with Abraham for a long time now, and through those many experiences, God was revealing more and more of his own character to Abraham.
[time=2135] God, the director, did this in order to solidify within Abraham's mind that he was the true and living Jehovah God, and that he could, and should be trusted.
[time=2146] But now we come to a place, here in Genesis 22, where the question is gonna get asked, Abraham, how deeply do you trust me?
[time=2153] How much faith are you willing to exercise with me?
[time=2159] Would Abraham really truly follow the script?
[time=2164] You know, from the director's chair, we begin to understand as you read through this passage.
[time=2168] As you understand perazzo, it's the reason I gave you the insight on perazzo.
[time=2172] As you think about that, and it starts to play itself out in our story, you and I can begin to understand that this test wasn't about Abraham failing.
[time=2181] It wasn't even about him losing his son, this situation, this scenario is about God celebrating, or at least wanting to celebrate, the great faith and trust in this man, whom he'd come to know, and love in the years that they had spent together.
[time=2199] This is about Abraham's faith, as it's tested, and God taking him in that faith to the next level of maturity and trust.
[time=2210] In fact, there's an early, it was great to come across this this week, there's an early Greek translation of the Old Testament called the Samakas.
[time=2219] It was called the Samakas because Samakas the Ebonite, it's a nice name, Samakas the Ebonite translated it.
[time=2227] Listen to what he said, in the Samakas, it says God put great honor.
[time=2233] It's not about God being mean or unfair, it says God put great honor on Abraham by giving him this opportunity of showing to all successive ages.
[time=2244] And did it show to all successive ages?
[time=2248] Yes or no?
[time=2249] Absolutely.
[time=2250] God put great honor on Abraham by giving him this opportunity of showing to all successive ages the nature and power of an unshaken faith in the goodness and faithfulness of God.
[time=2263] You see the difference from backstage, this was never about killing Isaac.
[time=2268] It was about an assessment, a measurement of one's faith.
[time=2272] How real, how real would his faith be?
[time=2276] Well, you know what?
[time=2277] As the story progresses, you realize that some exams are like pop quizzes.
[time=2283] You can write that down.
[time=2284] Some exams are like pop quizzes, you never, you ever walked into a room and you sat down and you saw that funny look on the teacher's face, you knew something was up, you had no idea it was coming, you didn't study for it, it's why they call it a what, pop quiz.
[time=2297] Some exams are like pop quizzes, you never see it coming.
[time=2301] After 50 years, after the promise of a child and the promise of a blessing of a nation and a new land, after all of that, God says take your son, verse two.
[time=2312] Your only son Isaac, whom you love and go to the region of Mariah, sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.
[time=2324] You know, we're never really ready for calamity, are we?
[time=2331] I mean, you're never really prepared for what happens sometimes.
[time=2337] Imagine after all this time, following all that Abraham and his God had been through together out of nowhere he kissed this command.
[time=2346] He had waited so long for the promise of a son to come about, and now that Isaac is in his 20s, I looked at that a little bit more this week, I would say without doubt now after even further reading and study, I would say without doubt, probably 25 years old.
[time=2362] Just becoming a man.
[time=2365] And God gives this unbelievable command.
[time=2372] For all intents and purposes, humanly speaking, his son was now as good as dead.
[time=2377] How could this be?
[time=2379] You ever been there?
[time=2380] You ever get hit out of nowhere with something God allowed and thought to yourself?
[time=2390] What are you thinking?
[time=2395] Why would you do this now?
[time=2398] Why?
[time=2400] Do you really think that this is gonna be good?
[time=2405] Do you think this is really gonna go well?
[time=2407] I mean, have you ever been in that spot?
[time=2409] Many of you stood this morning, so I'm assuming you have been.
[time=2412] I know I have been.
[time=2414] I've thought those thoughts I've asked those questions.
[time=2417] Well, before we start judging as we often do this entire passage by today's standards, we need to practice what I told you about last week.
[time=2427] That was correct hermeneutics.
[time=2429] Whenever you're interpreting the scriptures, there's a number of questions that you've gotta ask.
[time=2434] There's a number of things that you need to look into before you start forming your opinion.
[time=2438] Abraham was the first, remember we talked about Abraham was the first of the people?
[time=2443] Jehovah was developing.
[time=2445] He didn't have the advantage of a written history of God's words and commandments laid out for him.
[time=2451] This was all completely new to him.
[time=2454] And then secondly, whenever you're doing hoovering hoovermeneutics, you always wanna look at the cultural backdrop.
[time=2459] Culturally, you gotta remember this that since child sacrifice was commonly practiced.
[time=2467] It was commonly practiced throughout the Venholm world.
[time=2473] And it was in particular popular there in Canaan.
[time=2476] Abraham didn't think so much in terms of there being a prohibition for in the cultures of that day, all types of things were done in the name of worship in order to secure prolific crops, fertility, power and wealth.
[time=2490] It was common for men to sacrifice their kids.
[time=2494] Just happened all the time.
[time=2498] See, did you know this?
[time=2501] This is the backdrop within which he gets this command.
[time=2506] Common, but after all this, he's gotta be wondering after all this time, after all that he and this uncommon God had been through.
[time=2516] Why would God ask in such a common way for Isaac's life?
[time=2520] Well, my friends, here's a great, here's a great lesson for you and me.
[time=2527] With whatever time we got left, I just want you to, boy, just hang on here and take this in.
[time=2534] This is what it boils down to.
[time=2536] Key, key referenced this.
[time=2539] I mean, without even knowing the message today, she just perfectly referenced this as she shared her story with you.
[time=2547] As I had you stand, I asked you a question.
[time=2550] I used this one word in my question.
[time=2554] I'll show it to you here in a moment.
[time=2555] You responded to that one word that I used in this question.
[time=2559] I want you to see something here.
[time=2562] It's very important for you and I to learn.
[time=2564] Pop quizzes, get past.
[time=2566] Pop exams, get past.
[time=2570] When we stick with what we want, say it out loud.
[time=2573] With what we know.
[time=2576] I truly believe, as I read this, again and again and again, as I read through this, I truly believe that there's something more to this story, something very special and very deep within Abraham going on.
[time=2592] Something that only comes from experience and maturity.
[time=2596] Experience with God and the maturity that he grows in you and I as we experience him.
[time=2604] There was a, there was a calmness to him.
[time=2608] I want to read this to you.
[time=2610] There was a calmness about Abraham that day and uncanny type of ease with which he responds to this command of God to sacrifice his son on the altar.
[time=2624] Genesis 22, you can look at it yourself.
[time=2630] Listen, picture as you listen, picture him physically responding.
[time=2637] So Abraham rose, verse three.
[time=2639] So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey.
[time=2643] Took two of his young men with him and Isaac, his son.
[time=2646] I mean, he split wood for the burnt offering and a rose and went to the place of which God had told him.
[time=2652] On the third day, three days go by.
[time=2658] How those three days treat you?
[time=2660] On the third day, mulling this over and thinking on this.
[time=2667] On the third day, Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance.
[time=2672] Abraham said to his young men, stay here with the donkey and I and the lad will go over there and we will worship and what?
[time=2681] Do you see them?
[time=2685] You hear the faith oozing out right there?
[time=2689] Who does he say will return?
[time=2690] Just him or he and the lad?
[time=2693] He and the lad, where does this come from?
[time=2697] And we will worship and we will return to you.
[time=2702] Verse six, Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac, his son and he took his hand and he took in his hand, the fire and the knife.
[time=2713] So the two of them walked on together.
[time=2719] Calm, the ease with which he responds.
[time=2724] You see, by this time in his life, I believe my friends Abraham had learned that God always figured something out.
[time=2731] He'd learned, and some of you in the room this morning, I think have learned this.
[time=2735] Others, others of us need to learn this.
[time=2738] He'd learned that God's always up to something good.
[time=2742] Do you know this?
[time=2744] That God is always up to something, what?
[time=2747] He's always up to something good.
[time=2750] Maybe not good circumstantially in the moment, kill your son as a burnt offering.
[time=2757] Maybe not good circumstantially in the moment, oh, my wife just left me.
[time=2763] Maybe not circumstantially in the moment I just lost my job.
[time=2767] See, he's always up to something good.
[time=2771] Maybe not circumstantially in the moment, but good for our lives and his great name in time.
[time=2778] Amen, it's true about him.
[time=2783] You figured that out yet?
[time=2786] Some of you feel close to figuring that out.
[time=2790] Maybe others of you feel a million miles away like I do at times.
[time=2794] He had learned that God could be trusted.
[time=2799] I love Abraham's slow, deliberate response.
[time=2804] Gets the donkey, gets the wood, gets the servant,
[time=2810] gets the boy, hits the road, takes the trip, goes three days, sees the mountain, you with me?
[time=2816] Just goes.
[time=2817] Just deliberate, faith-filled obedience.
[time=2823] Reminds me, here's the word.
[time=2830] Here's the word.
[time=2832] Here's where all this kind of comes to.
[time=2835] It's the word key used, it's the word I used with you and the question I asked you, and here's the word.
[time=2840] This all reminds me of this amazing word that we see used in both the Old Testament and New Testament.
[time=2849] It's the Greek word in the New Testament.
[time=2851] The word is Oida.
[time=2853] I've learned a lot about this word from my good friend, Rod Ovid.
[time=2859] Rod has taught me and invested in me and helped me see the richness of this word.
[time=2865] And when I read this story, this narrative from Genesis 22, and I see Abraham's slow, deliberate, obedient response to this unspeakable request or command.
[time=2877] I'm reminded of the word Oida, O-I-D-A.
[time=2880] You see it, I'll tell you the definition.
[time=2882] Let me read it to you first from 2 Timothy 1.12.
[time=2886] Let me read a usage of the word Oida.
[time=2888] Paul, who's in chains getting completely and thoroughly mistreated.
[time=2894] For this reason Paul writes to Timothy, I also suffer these things.
[time=2898] But I am not ashamed for I, everybody say the word out loud.
[time=2903] I know.
[time=2904] Key said, key said, she knew, she knew God was what?
[time=2907] She knew God was good.
[time=2909] I asked you stand if there was this place in time where it all seemed to go south, but you what, say it, knew.
[time=2917] And here's this word, Oida, this knowing.
[time=2921] Oida is knowledge that comes from a deep and longstanding experience with God.
[time=2929] Oida is that which you know to be true about him that is an absolute sure thing.
[time=2935] Oida isn't questioned.
[time=2936] Oida isn't doubted.
[time=2938] Oida knows for sure.
[time=2941] So much has transpired over time.
[time=2944] There's been such consistency in regularity that you just what?
[time=2948] You just know that he is who he is.
[time=2954] That his promises are true.
[time=2956] That his faithfulness is great.
[time=2957] You just know it.
[time=2958] It may not in the moment make the slightest bit of sense, but because of what you've been through, because of what you've studied, because of what you've read, because of what you've lived with him, you just say it, know it.
[time=2972] Oida.
[time=2975] If I were to ask all of you who stood up this morning, and even others of you who didn't, I would suspect, because of what you've seen, and because of what you've experienced, because of what you've studied, and come to see us truth about him, because of how he has evidenced that, which is true about him to you in your own life.
[time=2995] If I were to say to you, just pick one thing that you know to be true about God.
[time=2999] You know because of what you've seen, and experienced with him that he is, boom, fill in the blank.
[time=3005] You know that he is, go ahead, somebody say it.
[time=3011] Faithful, anybody, loud.
[time=3013] Faithful, what else?
[time=3016] Good, what else?
[time=3017] Absolutely, amen.
[time=3020] What else?
[time=3021] Uh-huh.
[time=3023] You know that God is what?
[time=3027] Awesome.
[time=3028] Faithful, true, good.
[time=3031] You and I know this because we've seen it.
[time=3034] Watch this, it doesn't blow your mind.
[time=3036] Hebrews 11.
[time=3038] Abraham, although he had no idea how, he just knew that God was gonna keep this child of, remember God promised him this child of promise.
[time=3052] And I don't know how he put this together.
[time=3056] I think it's what great faith does.
[time=3057] It just births this in us, but he so believed that this promise of a child and a nation that would come.
[time=3065] He so believed it.
[time=3067] Do you know what it says?
[time=3068] Have you ever read it and just kind of thought about it?
[time=3070] Maybe you've read it and not thought about it, but look at Hebrews 11.
[time=3073] I want you to read it and think about it today.
[time=3076] Hebrews 11, 17, it's amazing.
[time=3080] By faith, Abraham, when he was tested, parazzo, offered up Isaac and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son.
[time=3094] That sound familiar?
[time=3095] Abraham and Isaac are a type.
[time=3100] They are an illustration in the Old Testament of John 3, 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only what?
[time=3108] Begotten son.
[time=3109] Offering up his only begotten son.
[time=3113] It was he to whom it was said.
[time=3116] In Isaac, your descendants shall be called.
[time=3119] So he had been promised that, so because he had been promised that and because he believed in his God because he oiled up, because he knew it was true.
[time=3129] Look at 19, he considered back here in Genesis 22
[time=3135] that God is able to raise people even from the what?
[time=3141] Say it, what?
[time=3142] Where had Abraham ever heard about people being raised
[time=3151] from the dead?
[time=3154] Had Abraham ever heard the gospel?
[time=3156] Yes or no?
[time=3157] No.
[time=3158] Did Abraham know the story of the tomb?
[time=3161] No.
[time=3161] Did Abraham even know about Messiah and how all that would play out in Jerusalem and the Pharisees, did he know any of this?
[time=3167] Did he have any context or any backdrop for the chosen one, the one promised to be killed and then raised from the dead?
[time=3175] Where does this come from?
[time=3176] You know where this comes from?
[time=3177] This comes.
[time=3178] When you've been promised something by a good God and when the circumstance makes absolutely no sense at all true, deep, genuine faith produces belief that's beyond what you would even know about or understand.
[time=3196] It's amazing.
[time=3200] It shows us that a deep faith goes beyond what we know, what we are aware of beyond anything we can even conceive.
[time=3210] Here's what I want you to hear this morning and we'll go.
[time=3212] He knew, do you?
[time=3214] Do you know this?
[time=3219] He knew that even the worst case scenario.
[time=3223] What's yours?
[time=3228] What's your worst case scenario?
[time=3230] He knew that even the worst case scenario would be somehow redeemable.
[time=3235] He believed that whatever God allowed, God would in time use, whatever God allowed, God would use that very thing to bring blessing.
[time=3243] You know where else in the New Testament you find Oida?
[time=3247] For I know that God causes all things.
[time=3253] Romans eight.
[time=3256] For I know that God causes all things to work together for what?
[time=3260] Oida.
[time=3262] It's almost as if Abraham had become familiar
[time=3268] with a Greek word he'd never even heard of.
[time=3272] And he knew that God would cause all things.
[time=3276] Worst case scenario, God would figure out a way to redeem it.
[time=3281] Here's what I want to make sure we're clear on.
[time=3286] You're going to be asked, John 1633, in this world you will have, what, trouble.
[time=3296] In this world you will have tribulation.
[time=3298] But take heart, take courage.
[time=3302] He's overcome the world.
[time=3304] And I want to make sure you understand, you are going to be asked to put your son on the altar, so to speak.
[time=3312] You're going to go to the doctor one day and he's going to tell you you got a brain tumor.
[time=3317] Just boom out of nowhere.
[time=3318] You're going to go home one day and find a note on your dresser and your wife's going to be gone.
[time=3324] Your test for cancer is going to come back positive.
[time=3328] Your lifelong struggle may end up being a lifelong struggle.
[time=3335] There may be days when the wind blows in your life so hard you never imagined it could blow that way.
[time=3345] Friends, you never thought would desert you, will turn on you and gossip about you and leave you.
[time=3351] Your child may grow up living with a disease.
[time=3356] I don't know which one of those are going to come to fruition.
[time=3362] I don't know if it'll come to fruition for you or you.
[time=3366] But it's going to happen.
[time=3369] And you and I can, with a timeless story like this, be reminded of the fact that there is a faith and a trust that you and I can possess that can lead us through that, whatever that may be.
[time=3382] You and I can, John 1633.
[time=3384] We can take heart and we can take courage.
[time=3388] We can believe things we have no concept of because that's how good he is and we know it.
[time=3396] Oida, amen?
[time=3399] Stand and let's pray.
[time=3402] Father, we are grateful this morning for your word.
[time=3405] We're thankful for a behind the scenes look at a scenario that has left many confused and yet now this morning God, we look at it and we see your hand, your directing hand all over it and Father, we are thankful for what Abraham believed to be true and we're thankful for the obedience that that wrought in his life, oh God, we pray for that same kind of trust and faith would you grow that in us.
[time=3433] May we see you for what you are.
[time=3435] As Keith said this morning, a good God whose faithfulness
[time=3441] can be trusted, oh God, would we please, as your people, trust you with the most intimate and most difficult and most challenging circumstances of our lives.
[time=3453] May we load up the donkey, may we walk toward the hill.
[time=3457] And may we as we approach that hill see you, not the pain, not the discomfort, not everything be in sideways and go in south, but God, may we look with our heads up at this place.
[time=3470] And may we see you and your goodness and may we trust you and keep walking, all the people.
[time=3478] Great hope and participation and we will be prepared.
[time=3481] (upbeat music)
