[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us.
[time=36] I wanna take a few moments this morning, if I can, and reintroduce you to a resource that we have available to all of you in our Bible Hour audience, and also introduce you to a new resource that I think could really be helpful for some very special people in your life.
[time=53] Let's start with the resource that you've heard a little bit about.
[time=57] I just feel compelled to tell you again about digging deeper.
[time=61] That's right.
[time=61] When you go to our website at blackhawkministries.org, you'll find there on our homepage a digging deeper icon.
[time=69] When you click on that, what that provides you with is a chance to really further the discussion from that week's message.
[time=76] You know, we spend 35 minutes or so every week trying to unpack the great truth of God's word.
[time=82] There hasn't been a Sunday in 22 years of ministry where I've ever sat down and felt like we really got to be thorough and complete in our study.
[time=92] So what we've done is compiled a great team of people who every week provide you with an interactive Bible study, a chance for you to review what we talked about and then further that study and its application in your life each and every week.
[time=108] So go to our website, click on the digging deeper icon, and you'll be blown away and encouraged by the opportunity.
[time=115] It provides you to further your own study and understanding of this great life-changing truth.
[time=121] Hey, also on that same website homepage over on the other side, you're going to find another icon that says dig kids.
[time=128] That's right, dig kids.
[time=129] And what that is is really just a kid's version, a family-friendly version of digging deeper, a chance for you with your little ones.
[time=138] No matter how old they are, a chance for you to interact with that same message at a young person's level, a chance for you to, as a father or mother or grandfather or grandmother, anybody who has influence over little ones, you can take this dig kids resource and invest in them further the great life-changing truth of God's Word.
[time=159] I'm so thankful for these resources, so grateful for those who helped put them together.
[time=165] And I hope you'll use them this week and in the weeks to come as you continue to deepen your own understanding and love of God's Word.
[time=172] Hey, thanks for tuning in.
[time=174] We're thankful that you're a part of the Blackhawk family.
[time=177] Thankful that you are here with us and I hope today you'll be encouraged by the message from God's Word.
[time=183] Thank you so much.
[time=184] Have a great week and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=187] [MUSIC - 503 seconds]
[time=694] - The other thing I want to come back to
[time=700] is the discussion that we've kind of been having in the last several weeks.
[time=703] Every Sunday, I get to be here this summer.
[time=705] I just want to kind of keep talking you through some things that we keep thinking through as a leadership, things I just keep wrestling with in my own heart and mind.
[time=714] Let me take you back to a statement that we've been looking at over the last few weeks or so.
[time=718] This is something we really believe God is doing.
[time=721] This is something we really can't wait to see Him fulfill in the days to come at Black Hawk.
[time=726] We long to be, we really do.
[time=728] We long to be a diverse community of disciples.
[time=731] You understand that, right?
[time=733] Diverse, you're different than I am.
[time=736] There are a lot of differences in this room.
[time=738] We come from different backgrounds.
[time=740] We come from different upbringings.
[time=742] We are different ages.
[time=744] You look around our community today.
[time=746] Here in Northeast Fort Wayne, the demographic is changing, giving us an opportunity, a privileged chance to welcome and befriend and partner with all kinds of people, red, yellow, black and white, all precious in His sight, educated, uneducated, rich, poor and in between.
[time=765] I mean, God's giving us this amazing opportunity to be a people who are willing in our hearts to be a diverse community of disciples.
[time=774] Disciples, Jesus, imitators.
[time=778] We've tried to really simplify that for us in recent days.
[time=780] It's really what we wanna do and it's really all we wanna do.
[time=785] We just want to follow Jesus.
[time=790] We wanna follow the ways of Jesus.
[time=793] We wanna see what Jesus did.
[time=795] We wanna watch how Jesus lived.
[time=797] We wanna see His values.
[time=798] We wanna see the way He conducted Himself.
[time=801] We wanna see the way in which He did.
[time=803] We wanna follow after Him.
[time=805] Jesus, imitators, who's personal and financial and cultural differences, what?
[time=810] Say it, disappear.
[time=813] Just disappear.
[time=814] I don't care who you are.
[time=815] You don't care who I am.
[time=816] We don't care where we've been.
[time=818] I don't care the different color of your skin.
[time=820] I don't care the different way in which you speak.
[time=823] I don't care what kind of job you have.
[time=825] You don't care how much money I make.
[time=826] We are just in this thing together.
[time=829] Those differences disappear in our genuine love for each other and our mutual commitment to follow our King.
[time=838] Amen?
[time=839] Well, we read that.
[time=840] Last week we asked a question.
[time=842] It was a good question, I think.
[time=843] A great question for you and I to think through.
[time=845] In light of that statement, and how will we at Black Hawk Ministries, how will we do ministry in a way that, back to that statement, imitates Jesus?
[time=856] How do we do that?
[time=857] Well, what did Jesus do?
[time=861] And this is where we came up with that.
[time=863] We didn't come up with it, but we just kinda passed it along to you.
[time=865] It's a phrase, and you know what?
[time=866] It's just a phrase.
[time=868] It's not from the Scriptures.
[time=869] It's not absolute truth, it's just a phrase.
[time=872] But it's an interesting phrase that has got me thinking a lot in recent days.
[time=877] Are we gonna be attractional in our ministry approach, which is, hear me, okay, this is not bad and evil.
[time=885] This is not wrong and right.
[time=887] These are two different styles.
[time=888] Are we gonna be attractional, or are we going to be incarnational?
[time=893] Encarnational, what does that mean?
[time=896] When you think incarnational, you think about Jesus.
[time=899] He was incarnational, he existed at one point in time in the heavenlies in the comfort and joy of intimacy with God.
[time=908] He was safe, if you will, inside, but he came out of that.
[time=912] And he took on human flesh, the incarnation.
[time=916] Jesus leaves the heavenlies and comes to mankind and he gets dirty and he gets beaten up and he gets misunderstood.
[time=924] There's attractional or incarnational.
[time=928] The attractional approach, we kinda talked about it last week, tries to bring in an effort to reach people, let me say that, in an effort to reach people, the attractional approach attempts to do all that they can to bring people where?
[time=946] In, trying to bring people in in order to reach them.
[time=951] And we do all kinds of things to try and get people in to try and reach them with the gospel, that's one approach.
[time=959] The incarnational model wouldn't be so much us trying to bring them in to reach them.
[time=966] It would be our effort to reach them by you and I going out.
[time=971] You and I is the body of Christ.
[time=976] Yes, we gather, we come in to be fed and taught the word of God to have our spiritual hearts and minds built up and then we, in the incarnational model, we go.
[time=986] You go to work and you go to your street and you go to your neighborhood and you go to your community and you go and I go, we go outside these four walls to do the work of ministry, priests who go.
[time=1000] That's how the, in the incarnational model, that's how the church works.
[time=1004] The church is effective and the church grows and the church impacts its world because the people go.
[time=1011] They scatter and they love and they serve and they make a difference in their worlds.
[time=1018] Are you with me?
[time=1019] Some things to think about.
[time=1020] One approach, one approach, the attractional approach,
[time=1026] if we're trying to get them in in order to reach them, then we can become very, what?
[time=1034] Very facility dependent.
[time=1036] I think sometimes that's where, over the years, people have gotten a little bit confused and thought that the church was a building because so many times the building has been so primary in this endeavor because we've wanted to get them inside the four walls in order to reach them, that if we didn't have the building, then we're, what are we gonna do?
[time=1062] Well, the other one that isn't so much facility dependent, the incarnational approach where you and I and the whole effort of the church, resting on our willingness to go and make a difference in your world and mind.
[time=1076] See, that's not facility dependent that's people or priesthood dependent.
[time=1083] I got a good friend who every time we meet for coffee, without fail always asks me the same question.
[time=1090] What are you gonna do when one night you get a phone call at two in the morning and it's your maintenance guy and he says, "Oh my gosh, the church has burned to the ground." It's gone, Kelly.
[time=1101] It's like all gone.
[time=1104] There is no more Blackhawk.
[time=1107] It burned to the ground.
[time=1110] And he asks me, how will ministry move forward without the building?
[time=1121] And when you're so absolutely dependent on the building for ministry to move forward, you got a problem.
[time=1128] But when you're dependent on, and I believe it's really the way God designed this thing, I don't think God was ever intending us to become dependent upon a building.
[time=1136] I think God always designed for the ministry of the church to be dependent on who?
[time=1142] On the body, on you and you and you and you and me.
[time=1148] I'm grateful, I hope it never burns down.
[time=1153] Really, I love what God has given us.
[time=1156] But this isn't the church, you're the church.
[time=1158] And for us to make a difference in this world, you and I have to be incarnational.
[time=1163] Couple of examples, just some people wrote me this week.
[time=1166] What do you mean by incarnational?
[time=1168] How does it really work?
[time=1169] So just a couple of examples.
[time=1171] Corbin and Tanya, a few summers ago, they decided to take their acting gift that God had given them, and they didn't use it inside these four walls.
[time=1179] They have in the past and were thankful that they have.
[time=1182] That summer they chose to go downtown and join the Civic Theater effort with Beauty and the Beast.
[time=1187] And they got to know people and spent time with people and used those gifts down with the beauty and the beast production.
[time=1193] It was an amazing opportunity for them.
[time=1195] Friendships were formed and they had a chance to kind of leave the heavenlies, if you will, and go and be with and love and come alongside.
[time=1202] It was an amazing privilege.
[time=1204] Somebody came to me and said, "Hey, I play flute." And God's giving me this gift and I'm actually going to have a chance to play at the Philharmonic on a regular basis.
[time=1213] But my problem is I want to play here, but rehearsal nights are the same.
[time=1218] Well, you know what, I'd be okay with that individual choosing however they chose, but I would really want them to think about taking that flute and going downtown and sitting in that chair and getting to know those flautists.
[time=1232] Did I say that right?
[time=1233] Those flautists on either side and the people in that orchestra, I'd love to see people say to me, "Hey, we should start a church league." They want to start a basketball league for a church basketball league.
[time=1247] We got all these gyms and they'll often say, "I'll say, you know what?
[time=1251] You got some guys who want to play in a league.
[time=1254] Get your guys and go play in a league.
[time=1259] Let's not start one here.
[time=1261] Let's go to where the leagues already exist and you go play and make a difference in the way that you play and in the way that you relate.
[time=1271] Coffee shop, people have said to us, "You know what, we've got to redesign our four year and we should build a coffee shop that's open all week long because people that they like coffee and they'll come to a coffee shop and we could get folks that could..." I say, "You know what?
[time=1284] Let's not build a coffee shop." How about you and me?
[time=1288] I love coffee.
[time=1289] Who loves coffee?
[time=1289] Raise their hand.
[time=1290] How about we just go to a coffee shop and make that coffee shop our own?
[time=1297] How about we go and just plant ourselves in the same seat five days a week and let's pray for the people that work there and befriend the folks we get to meet.
[time=1308] It's like cheers, you know, but it just kind of came out.
[time=1315] It's like cheers, but it's not like, you know, it's not booze, it's coffee.
[time=1321] Because coffee's kind of like booze, never mind.
[time=1324] But you get what I'm saying.
[time=1326] You might say to me, "Here you go, last one." You might say to me, "Do an evangelistic service." You know, we'll invite all of our friends and we'll bring them in and you do a message that articulates and makes clear the gospel that can change and redeem lives.
[time=1344] And you know what, that's not a bad idea.
[time=1347] This isn't about good and bad, remember?
[time=1351] But I might say to you, priesthood, who have been charged with the work of ministry, I might say instead of an evangelistic service, let's live evangelistic lives.
[time=1362] How about you and me and everybody that calls this place home?
[time=1367] You begin to build redemptive relationships with those people God's divinely put in your neighborhood, where you work in your extended family, in that league or in that coffee shop.
[time=1381] And how about you build a friendship with them that would lead to you having a party at your house that you invite them to and you share a meal and have a great time getting to know them better and you never know the redemptive friendship that leads to the party might lead to a chance for you to do more things, maybe take a vacation with their family or go to a game downtown or who knows what.
[time=1402] And that might lead to as they watch your life and you interact with theirs, a chance for you to share with them at some point, the things that you believe and you find hope in.
[time=1412] You never know that might lead to a living room setting, three to six months down the road, where all of a sudden they've said yes to an invitation from you to look at God's word and to see right there how it can make a difference in the everyday of life.
[time=1427] You never know where that's gonna go.
[time=1429] I'd rather, really honestly, I'd rather you do that than me give a message.
[time=1435] So we wanna be incarnational.
[time=1440] We wanna be a diverse community of Jesus imitators and let's keep working on that together, shall we?
[time=1446] Amen? - Amen.
[time=1447] - Amen.
[time=1448] We got a great opportunity this morning.
[time=1449] We're gonna continue on in our series from Genesis.
[time=1452] Jesse Henna's here, come on up, Jesse.
[time=1453] Jesse is our student ministry pastor here at Black Hawk.
[time=1457] He has for over three years now given leadership to that entire endeavor to 12 liquid, our high school and middle school ministries.
[time=1463] Jesse and those that work with Jesse have done a phenomenal job, a phenomenal job of not only leading that ministry in so many different ways,
[time=1477] but they've done a great job of getting to know your kids in mind.
[time=1479] They've made a relational investment in so many of them.
[time=1483] We have more and more campuses from around Fort Wayne, now represented in 212 than ever before.
[time=1490] And I'm so grateful for the energy that this guy brings to it.
[time=1492] So thankful for his love for our kids, yours and mine and thankful that he was willing to say yes today, to keep us going in this series.
[time=1501] I'm gonna enjoy getting to listen and you're gonna be blessed.
[time=1504] So we're the thankful heart for the enormous amount of time.
[time=1508] Would you welcome Jesse Henna.
[time=1510] (audience applauds) You good?
[time=1514] - Thank you, good, good.
[time=1519] And make sure that microphone is on.
[time=1521] If I would be a poor youth pastor, if I didn't take this opportunity, which I forgot first service to say, we're looking for people to be incarnational with our students.
[time=1533] And if that's something you would like to do, something we always need adult people to enter into students' lives and love on them and impact them.
[time=1542] And we've got a little thing in the bulletin that you can fill out.
[time=1545] Give us your name and we can sit down and talk about what that looks like for you.
[time=1549] And I would love to meet you.
[time=1550] I'd love to talk to you about that.
[time=1553] I think instead of a coffee shop, it should be a Taco Bell.
[time=1556] (audience laughs) Just saying.
[time=1560] Yesterday, I had the opportunity or, I don't know, maybe opportunity to run a 5K with my wife.
[time=1567] I am not built for distance, okay?
[time=1572] Just say that right now.
[time=1573] I've been running for a few months.
[time=1576] I'm up to about four miles, but yesterday was a race thing.
[time=1579] It was, I made it.
[time=1583] Is my wife is she in here?
[time=1585] (audience applauds) Oh, there they are, okay.
[time=1588] Good, I was so worried about you guys.
[time=1590] I was wondering.
[time=1591] And I made it and we started the race and it started pouring and it was lightning and I was like perfect.
[time=1596] I can get hit by lightning and not have to finish the race and not have to speak Sunday morning.
[time=1605] But it didn't happen and I finished and it was a good time.
[time=1608] I don't know my time, we'll have to check those later.
[time=1612] But my wife did come in a few several seconds ahead of me.
[time=1618] (laughs) That's all right.
[time=1621] She is built for distance, I am not.
[time=1624] Hey, we are in Genesis 27 and one of the things I love about Genesis is it's mostly narrative, it's mostly story.
[time=1633] And when I have the opportunity with my two little girls, I have Grace who's seven and Gabby who's five.
[time=1639] Grace is for several, or a few years now been reading to me and I fall asleep on her bed and I had to get out, I gotta go to bed.
[time=1647] That's Grace, okay, that's wonderful.
[time=1649] But Gabby, I still get to read a little bit.
[time=1652] Hey gabbers.
[time=1653] And we love to read books that make us laugh like the runaway pancake.
[time=1658] We read that one often, that's our favorite.
[time=1661] And we read Curious George and I'll never understand why Curious George, the man with the yellow hat, he's never gonna figure it out.
[time=1668] But when he leaves that monkey alone, I mean, George is gonna get into stuff.
[time=1674] But several books later, he keeps leaving that monkey alone and it's funny and we learn great stuff.
[time=1680] We learn lessons, we learn morals, we learn not to cry wolf, which is kind of our story, not to lie, okay?
[time=1688] And I think it's really cool that Jesus, in his day, he brought a story, he brought the new news, the new story of God's love and his mercy and his grace.
[time=1701] It wasn't a story of empire dominance or religious legalism or Essaean seclusion.
[time=1707] It was the new news, the good news of the gospel that there is a God and he is all about redeeming his people and entering into relationship with us.
[time=1718] That's the story Jesus brought and we can orientate our whole life around that story.
[time=1724] And as we continue seven timeless stories from Genesis, will you turn to Genesis chapter 27?
[time=1731] And as you turn there, you guys can go ahead, as you turn there, I just want to paint a little backdrop, kind of the flow of where we are in redemptive history before we get into chapter 27.
[time=1742] You can probably, it's safe to say, you can break the book of Genesis into two parts.
[time=1747] The first part would be Genesis one through 11, which deals with God's creative design and man's corruption of that design.
[time=1755] And the time period roughly covers between creation and the tower of Babel and in there, there's the fall, the flood, tower of Babel.
[time=1763] And then we come to part two, which is the patriarchal period, which is Genesis 12 through 50.
[time=1769] Genesis 12 through 50, tell us about what God has been doing about that corruption in terms of a redemptive design.
[time=1779] And in these chapters, it kind of slows down and it kind of zeroes in on a family.
[time=1787] Zeroes in on a man named Abram, who we know is Abraham and the movements and of these promised people.
[time=1795] And this all starts when God shows up in Abraham's Abrams, who we know is Abraham's life in Genesis 12, one.
[time=1802] And God comes in and he says this, "Lord has said to Abram, 'Leave your country, "your people and your father's household "and go to the land I will show you.
[time=1812] "I will make you into a great nation.
[time=1814] "I will bless you.
[time=1815] "I will make your name great." And you will be a blessing.
[time=1819] I will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you, I will curse.
[time=1824] And all peoples on earth will be a blessing through you.
[time=1829] God called the universe into existence by the power of his word and God called a special people into existence by the power of a promise.
[time=1837] And that promise comes in chapter 12.
[time=1840] And this is in essence, it's a covenant.
[time=1842] It's called the Abrahamic Covenant.
[time=1844] And it is between God and Abraham and Abraham's seed.
[time=1848] That's important.
[time=1849] It's not with all Israelites, nor is it only with them.
[time=1854] The covenant later, chapter 15, it becomes ratified in a dramatic, really cool story that you can read later.
[time=1861] And where God under obligates himself, "I am going to do this.
[time=1865] "I am God.
[time=1867] "I promise this is going to happen." The blessings he has promised are guaranteed and certain.
[time=1873] It's going to happen because it solely depends on God and his sovereignty and his character to do his promise.
[time=1882] The goal of this covenant, listen to this, as Kelly is talking about incarnation, of the goal of this covenant is that the blessing would be a blessing to all nations, that they would look and see Abraham's faith and they would say, "Abraham's God, we wanna know that God." And when we're out in the community and we're at Taco Bell, we're at games, we're in those leagues, we're in those coffee shops, they see us, we wanna know you're God, we wanna know what that's about.
[time=1906] We can't expect them to all come in here and find out about God, we gotta go to them.
[time=1911] And that's what God was doing from the beginning with the covenant to bless all nations.
[time=1917] That was the goal and God chosen his sovereignty to enter covenant with Abraham, take all responsibility so that other nations would see and know God.
[time=1926] And so Abraham and his family have been chosen to be the vessels through whom the blessings would come and eventually they would bring the Messiah.
[time=1937] Now, before we jump into the text, I'd like to pray and just ask God to show us, to teach us, to mold us and shape us.
[time=1945] Would you pray with me?
[time=1947] Father, thank you for this morning.
[time=1950] Thank you that you are God who keeps his promises, that you are God of love and of peace and of righteousness and of justice and of holiness and grace.
[time=1963] We pray, Lord, that our time together would be sweet, that you would teach us, that you would speak through me, that you would use this text to show us who we are and where we need to go, and that you would open our eyes to who you are and what your plan is and what your purposes are.
[time=1982] Pray these things in Christ's name, amen.
[time=1986] Okay, Genesis 27, I'm just gonna read a little bit and I'll have some comments and I broke it up into chunks and you'll figure it out as we go.
[time=1993] All right, Genesis 27, verse one.
[time=1995] When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau, his older son and said to him, "My son, here I am," Esau answered, Isaac said, "I am now an old man "and don't know the day of my death." Now then get your weapons, your quiver in your bow and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me, prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat so that I may give you my blessing before I die.
[time=2024] And I've kind of, I've titled this chunk, "The Conspiracy." Isaac is old, he can't see real well.
[time=2033] He's probably, he's around 130-ish.
[time=2035] We're not really sure, I don't know how that works in our years, dog years, whatever, doesn't matter, but he was old, okay, he was really old.
[time=2042] And he was feeling his end was near, he was a little anxious, he was being a little pressured, he wanted to tie up some loose ends, he wanted to get this done, right?
[time=2052] So he calls in Esau, this is where the conspiracy comes in because Esau is not next in line.
[time=2059] Although Isaac wanted him to be, that's who Isaac wants 'cause he favored him, but Isaac had to have known that in chapter 25, God came to Rebecca and said this to her, the Lord said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, "and two peoples from within you will be separated.
[time=2078] "One people will be stronger than the end, "of the older will serve the younger." Isaac had to have known that Esau would serve Jacob, not the other way around.
[time=2086] Isaac had to have known that when it said he, in his anxiousness, not trusting, not really sure, maybe he forgot, I don't know, Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, "Satan does not fill us with hatred of God,
[time=2102] "but with forgetfulness of God." How often, and when we're us, you and I, when we're calculating, or when we're figuring out what we are doing, or where we're going, or stuff, and we put God over here, and we don't calculate with God.
[time=2118] We leave him over here, and we kind of plan ourselves, and we go, "Okay, God, come on with us, "is what we're doing." You ever been there?
[time=2125] I've been there, been there a lot.
[time=2130] He also would have known Esau that he had, if we go, if we jump up 26, verse 34, this little detail is really important, and when narrative kind of zeroes in details, they're important.
[time=2142] 34, when Esau was 40 years old, he married Judith, daughter of Veree, the Hittite, and also basement, daughter of Elan the Hittite.
[time=2150] They were a source, listen to this, they were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebecca.
[time=2155] Esau married wrong, okay?
[time=2160] He was already almost disqualified for this, and he was unworthy to receive this blessing.
[time=2166] Isaac had to have known this.
[time=2168] So what's he do?
[time=2169] He conspires with Esau.
[time=2170] We're gonna get this done.
[time=2172] Go get some food, go hunt some game, bring it in, and I'll give you the blessing, and we'll call it good.
[time=2178] And this is done in secrecy, because this kind of blessing, this had all the legalness of a will today.
[time=2185] This would never be done in secrecy.
[time=2187] There would always be people around to witness what Isaac was going to, how he was gonna bless.
[time=2192] Well, Esau, but Isaac doesn't do that.
[time=2196] He does it in secret.
[time=2197] How many of us sins that we struggle with are done in secret, and in hiding behind the scenes, behind closed doors, when nobody knows.
[time=2208] So that's the conspiracy.
[time=2213] Isaac and Esau, they kind of get together, we're gonna get this done.
[time=2216] Now, verse five, we come to Rebecca, when I'm calling this the counter conspiracy, the counter conspiracy, listen to this.
[time=2225] Now, Rebecca was listening as Isaac spoke to a son Esau.
[time=2230] She was not supposed to be doing that.
[time=2232] When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, Rebecca said to her son, Jacob, look.
[time=2238] I overheard, come on, Rebecca.
[time=2243] I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the Lord before I die.
[time=2253] Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you.
[time=2257] Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats so that I can prepare some tasty food for your father.
[time=2263] Just the way he likes, then take it to your father to eat so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.
[time=2269] Rebecca is not gonna allow her favorite, Jacob,
[time=2275] to be skipped out on the blessing.
[time=2278] She's gonna manipulate.
[time=2279] She's gonna counter conspire with Jacob to get this thing done.
[time=2283] She's gonna manipulate the situation.
[time=2286] She thinks that God needs a little help here.
[time=2290] She thinks that he might not know what Isaac's doing
[time=2296] so she's gonna make it happen.
[time=2298] How many times have we manipulated situation, business deal, our spouse, our friends?
[time=2308] We've all done something like this.
[time=2313] Now, that's not good.
[time=2319] This story, I mean, we keep, this isn't good.
[time=2322] Nobody's right here.
[time=2323] There's no, nobody does anything right in this story.
[time=2327] It's kinda depressing.
[time=2329] This family is in dire need of some family counseling and they need to sit down and some chairs and get some stuff worked out because this is the family.
[time=2338] This is the covenantal line of Abraham.
[time=2341] This is the other chosen ones that God says, you know what, I'm gonna make, I'm gonna bless other nations.
[time=2348] Just, it's not very good, it's a dark day.
[time=2351] Now, Jacob, you would think, oh, Jacob, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he probably says no, Mom, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not right, no, listen to what Jacob says.
[time=2361] Jacob said to Rebecca, his mother, but my brother Esau is a hairy man and I'm a man with smooth skin.
[time=2367] He doesn't say, Mom, what are you, Mom, that's just not right.
[time=2370] We can't deceive Dad like that.
[time=2373] No, he says, wait, Mom, I love the plan, but we got, here's a problem right here, we need to fix this part.
[time=2380] He doesn't say, no, no, no, no, Mom, which would probably have ended it, but no, he goes along with it.
[time=2387] In fact, he adds to it.
[time=2390] What if he touched, oh, listen to this, what if my father touches me?
[time=2394] I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.
[time=2398] What if, what if I get caught?
[time=2403] If you are going to do something, any act or choice or whatever, and your first question that comes into your brain is, what if I get caught?
[time=2417] I'm gonna guess that's probably not the best choice, right?
[time=2422] If your first question is, what if I get caught?
[time=2427] I shouldn't do it, right?
[time=2430] You guys with me?
[time=2431] I'm not a prophet, I'm just a youth pastor, but I'm pretty sure that that's not the proper step for you, and I don't think God would honor that in your life if that's your question.
[time=2442] But we've all asked that question, we've all, we've all been there.
[time=2445] We're on the verge of something like, ah, and we think we're looking around.
[time=2451] What if I get caught, right?
[time=2454] C.S. Lewis said this, a little lie is like a little pregnancy, and we're gonna see three of Jacobs.
[time=2465] And so his mom says, hey, don't worry about it, I got that covered.
[time=2470] My mom, she says, my son, the curse can fall on me, just do what I say, go, go get that done for me.
[time=2476] And so, verse 14, so he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.
[time=2484] Listen to this, then Rebecca took the best clothes of Esau, her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son, Jacob.
[time=2494] She dressed him up for Halloween.
[time=2496] She also covered his hands in the smooth part of his, of his neck with the goat skins, and she handed to her son, Jacob, the tasty food and the bread she had made.
[time=2506] She went further, she conspired with him, go do this, and then she got the food already, and then she dressed him up, so Isaac would not know who it was.
[time=2517] This is deep, this is dark.
[time=2519] This is like desperate housewives.
[time=2522] I mean, there's just all kinds of people just conspire in one family.
[time=2527] He went to his father and said, my father, here we go, here comes the lies.
[time=2531] Yes, my son, he answered, who is it?
[time=2534] Jacob said to his father, amisa, your firstborn, that's lie number one.
[time=2539] I have done, as you told me, please sit up and eat some of my games so that you may give me your blessing.
[time=2547] Isaac asks his son, how did you, how did you find it so, how did you get all, how did you get that game so, how did you hunt so fast, bow and arrow, how did you do that so quickly?
[time=2557] Listen to this, this is what Jacob does.
[time=2560] The Lord, your God gave me success.
[time=2565] What?
[time=2570] He lied to his father and then he brings God into it.
[time=2575] Oh, God, oh, God, help me.
[time=2580] That's a big lie if we're gonna size him up.
[time=2587] That's a big one.
[time=2589] That's a no, no, a New Testament and an Old Testament.
[time=2592] You don't bring God into your evil deeds, okay?
[time=2596] How many times have we done something like that where we know in the revealed scriptures there are certain actions that are yeses and certain actions that are noes.
[time=2607] We know some of them.
[time=2609] And for some reason, circumstances, emotions, feelings and we say, I feel God has led me to this and it's contradictory to that, but we're sure that that's what God told us to do.
[time=2620] We've brought God into the lie.
[time=2623] How many times have we seen church is split because pastor A got ticked at pastor B and, oh, God told me to get mad at him
[time=2637] and leave and plant a church.
[time=2639] What?
[time=2639] Really? Are you sure it's God?
[time=2643] And they say, and here's the chump card.
[time=2645] Here's what they do.
[time=2647] The Holy Spirit is leading me to do this.
[time=2652] Really? The Holy Spirit, know that?
[time=2654] Did you talk to him about that?
[time=2658] Because we know what he's already said.
[time=2660] He'd already breathe this out.
[time=2662] We know that's not right.
[time=2664] Jacob brings God into it.
[time=2666] So often we do that.
[time=2668] Then Isaac said to Jacob, come near so I can touch you, my son, to know.
[time=2674] And this is interesting that there's senses involved in this.
[time=2679] When was the last time we saw some of the senses involved?
[time=2683] In the garden, when Eve looked, it was looked good and tasted good?
[time=2692] It's just interesting.
[time=2693] I don't think it has anything point-wise exegetically, but I think it's interesting that in this text, he says, come close so I can touch you.
[time=2703] And Rebecca already took care of that, right?
[time=2706] She's got this stuff all rigged up on him.
[time=2708] He must have looked goofy.
[time=2711] Jacob went close to father, touched him and said, the voice, and then there's the hearing.
[time=2717] Look, the voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
[time=2722] He did not recognize him for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau.
[time=2726] So he blessed him.
[time=2727] Are you really, are you really my son?
[time=2729] He asked, I am, I am.
[time=2731] He replied, line number three.
[time=2733] Then he said, my son, bring me some of your game to eat so that I may give you my blessing.
[time=2739] Jacob brought it to him and he ate.
[time=2741] And he brought some wine and he drank.
[time=2743] And then his father, Isaac, said to him, come here, my son, and kiss me.
[time=2747] Who was deceived by a kiss?
[time=2752] New Testament.
[time=2752] Jesus?
[time=2756] Yep.
[time=2757] When Isaac caught the smell, there's a smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed.
[time=2767] May God give you of heavens do and of earth's richness and abundance of grain and new wine.
[time=2774] May nations serve you and people's bow down to you.
[time=2777] Be Lord over your brothers and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.
[time=2783] May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.
[time=2788] So Isaac blesses Jacob.
[time=2792] After Isaac finished the blessing, he just barely leaves.
[time=2797] It says he had scarcely left his father's presence and Esau comes in.
[time=2801] I brought you the food father.
[time=2804] His father asked him, who are you?
[time=2806] Esau's like, well, who do you just told me to go do this?
[time=2810] Who do you think it is?
[time=2811] It's your son, your firstborn eats Esau.
[time=2815] And then it says 33, Isaac trembled violently for he realized he'd been tricked and deceived and manipulated that his plan
[time=2829] that he thought was so good and sure had been ruined had not come to pass.
[time=2836] Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me?
[time=2841] I ate it just before you came in and I blessed him.
[time=2844] And indeed he will be blessed.
[time=2845] When Esau heard this, his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry.
[time=2851] Esau also realized that Jacob had done it to him again.
[time=2856] Jacob already swindled him out of his birthright.
[time=2860] And now he comes in and he gets his blessing as well.
[time=2862] Bless me, father, me too.
[time=2865] He wants this blessing, but he said, your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.
[time=2871] But Isaac was also acting a little shady.
[time=2875] It's interesting.
[time=2875] Your brother came deceitfully.
[time=2876] I wasn't doing anything wrong.
[time=2877] He was doing it all wrong.
[time=2879] Esau said, isn't he rightly named Jacob?
[time=2881] He has deceived me these two times.
[time=2883] He took my birthright and now he's taking my blessing.
[time=2886] Then he asked, haven't you reserved any blessing for me?
[time=2889] Isaac answered Esau, I have made him Lord over you and have made all his relatives, his servants.
[time=2895] And I have sustained him with grain and new wine.
[time=2900] So what can I possibly do for you, my son?
[time=2903] Esau said to his father, do you have only one blessing, my father?
[time=2908] Bless me too, my father.
[time=2911] Then Esau, wept aloud.
[time=2912] His father, Isaac answered him, your dwelling will be away from the riches, earth's riches, away from the due of heaven above.
[time=2923] You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother.
[time=2926] But when you grow reckless, sorry, when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke off from your neck and that kind of ends our portion.
[time=2936] But what a story.
[time=2938] It's a pathetic grubby account of the family that constitute the promised line of the Abrahamic Covenant.
[time=2947] If we took a chapter of the scriptures and we kind of came into one of your bad days and we wrote some things about you and some of the things you've done and whatever probably would look similar, just guessing, I know it would for me.
[time=2965] I know it would for me.
[time=2969] They were all wrong, they lied, they deceived, they manipulated, they swindled, they had their own agendas, mom and son teamed up against dad, dad and son teamed against just everything.
[time=2980] And the brother takes the birthright and the blessing, the scheme, the conspiracy, the secrecy.
[time=2986] It's all wrong.
[time=2988] Doesn't look very good.
[time=2989] Yet in all of that, God sovereignly rules behind the scenes, bringing glory out of gore and honor out of shame, no matter the plans of men, nothing can get in the way of the purposes of God.
[time=3006] God will finish this story.
[time=3008] He knows, he's got it all written.
[time=3011] He's under control.
[time=3013] It's like Jesus in the boat.
[time=3014] The storms are going crazy.
[time=3015] Jesus is chilling, he's sleeping.
[time=3017] God's good, he's got it.
[time=3019] Psalms 45 says this, oh Lord my God, you have accomplished many things.
[time=3024] You've done amazing things and carried out your purposes for us.
[time=3029] No one can thwart you.
[time=3033] I want to declare them and talk about them, but they are too numerous to recount.
[time=3039] His purposes cannot be stopped by our sins, by your sins, by other people's sins, by kings, by nations, by me, by Kelly.
[time=3047] He cannot be stopped.
[time=3049] His purposes will ring true.
[time=3051] They cannot be thwarted.
[time=3053] The Creator God is the God of the garden.
[time=3056] He is the God who brought the flood.
[time=3057] He is the God who decided to choose this family that we just read about, a man named Abraham to enter into covenant in order to bless the world, to bring the Messiah into the world.
[time=3071] From the beginning to the end, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that same God, that one and only, he has always been, always about, and he has declared it in Leviticus, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.
[time=3082] I will be your God and you will be my people.
[time=3086] That God is on a mission of redemption to make a people for himself.
[time=3090] The God of Moses, the God of David, the judges, the prophets, all pointed to this God, having a people for himself.
[time=3098] A little lying, a little manipulating, a little of that cannot stop that.
[time=3103] He's gone to such an extent that God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that God went too far as that.
[time=3108] He sent his son and that same God who is still working even today in a world full of unemployment, terrorism, famine, abuse, depleted 401ks, the God from Wall Street to Main Street, from the city to the country, he is God, he can be trusted, he is worthy, he is good.
[time=3130] He will truly sustain, he will dream the broken and provide for his people that God used the foolishness of the world to redeem it.
[time=3140] He sent the promise Messiah, the Christ, who has washed away our sins, has reconciled us to God, eliminated shame and guilt.
[time=3148] So we would never have to wonder, not for a second, even in the most anxious of times, in the most pressured circumstances and unknown things that come in life, that he is going to show up and transform this world.
[time=3163] God is on mission, whether you like it or not, whether you're for him or against him, he's gonna do it because he's God.
[time=3172] And because God, listen to this, I think this is a great definition of faith.
[time=3179] God is who he says he is, he is, it's true, and he is able to do all he has promised to do.
[time=3188] Now as we kind of come to us today, 2009, the beauty of the stories of the scriptures and the events of scripture that we've been to, Kelly's been teaching, I think Webby taught on one, and what we've been going through, seven time of stories, is that we find the roots of our faith in these, in this family, our roots.
[time=3210] That's great, great, great, great, great, great, great, grandpa.
[time=3213] And look how he lived.
[time=3216] And look what God did, through him, despite him.
[time=3219] Our faith is deeply rooted in them, and we also find our sin deeply rooted in them.
[time=3229] It's also in us, deception, disobedience, conspiracy,
[time=3236] secrecy, is all there, and it's in us.
[time=3239] And the great thing about these stories is that God tells us the truth, it doesn't hide it.
[time=3247] He doesn't sugarcoat it, he tells the truth.
[time=3250] He shows us the good and the bad, the victories and the defeats in times of tremendous faith in times of disgusting sin, it's real, it's transparent, and even though they live, some of them, with terrible consequences, their faith, and their falls, God shines through and accomplishes his purpose and makes good on his promises.
[time=3276] That's the God we serve.
[time=3278] That's the God, the redeeming God, who's on mission, who sent his son to fulfill what Abraham was looking forward to.
[time=3287] And so in your life, think about your life.
[time=3294] How is faith affect you?
[time=3299] I just have a few questions I wanna leave you with.
[time=3303] Are you trusting in your God, listen to this, are you trusting in your God?
[time=3308] Or the God that is revealed in the scriptures?
[time=3313] See, so often we think, we've got ideas about who God is,
[time=3319] we've kind of built God in our minds.
[time=3322] And if it doesn't line up, if our circumstances don't line up with that, then God must not be faithful.
[time=3331] He must be angry at me, but no, no, the God of the scriptures, he will be there, he will sustain, he will provide.
[time=3340] And when we don't trust God,
[time=3346] we fill our lives with things that are Godless.
[time=3350] If our marriage is shaky, we go find something else
[time=3356] because we don't think the one person that we entered into covenant with is good enough.
[time=3362] So we'll find another one, that's not God's plan.
[time=3365] And if there's, we're just something wrong in our mind, we're just sad, we can't really get through life.
[time=3373] So we go and we find substances to fill us because we don't trust in God.
[time=3380] We don't think God is able to do, for me,
[time=3386] he's not enough, whatever it is.
[time=3389] When we don't trust God, we trust the Godless.
[time=3393] The second question is, your faith easily interrupted by the circumstances of life is my faith easily interrupted by the circumstances of life.
[time=3404] And I think every one of us can say, yeah, sometimes.
[time=3409] Sometimes it's really hard to trust God with certain things.
[time=3412] And sometimes it's really easy to trust God.
[time=3416] And the third one there, in Luke 17, the apostles are recorded as saying to Jesus, increase our faith, increase our faith.
[time=3428] And so I'm gonna ask you and me, what is an area, a situation, a relationship, an addiction, a marriage that you are needing to ask the Lord to increase your faith in order to find victory?
[time=3442] Let's pray.
[time=3445] Father God, we're thankful that you are God and that we are not.
[time=3450] And that you are the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, you are the God of Blackhawk, of Kelly, of me and all of us in this room.
[time=3463] Your purposes cannot be thwarted.
[time=3465] You will show up because you've been doing it from the beginning of time.
[time=3471] You are trustworthy, you are good.
[time=3473] And in an anxious times, is God still at work?
[time=3478] Yes, he is.
[time=3479] And we pray that you would increase our faith.
[time=3484] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3498] (upbeat music)
