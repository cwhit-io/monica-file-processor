[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well hello everybody and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] We're thankful that you've tuned in as always.
[time=37] It's a real pleasure for us to get to spend just these few minutes with you in the viewing audience.
[time=43] We're thankful for the relationship that God has given us with you.
[time=46] And I want to take a few minutes today and just remind you as part of the Black Hawk family, what means the most to us as we give ourselves to this ministry here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=58] What means the most to us, and we believe it means a lot to God as well, is that we would be a people, a diverse community of disciples, Jesus imitators.
[time=68] I think you've heard me say that recently.
[time=71] Jesus imitators whose personal and financial and cultural differences disappear in our genuine love for each other and our mutual commitment to follow the King.
[time=83] That's what we want to be.
[time=85] A diverse community of disciples, Jesus imitators.
[time=89] And we believe the best way that God has allowed us to pursue that vision is to be a people who would consistently and often gather to encounter our God, connect in smaller settings to engage in growth and go.
[time=105] Not sit still, not settle in, but go to enlarge his reach.
[time=110] To us it's really become that simple.
[time=112] We know it's a profound endeavor, but it's that simple.
[time=115] We gather on a weekly basis to encounter our God.
[time=119] We encounter him through worship.
[time=120] We encounter him through the scriptures.
[time=122] We encounter him through the fellowship that we enjoy on a Sunday morning.
[time=127] We connect in smaller settings.
[time=129] That might be four guys at a restaurant booth.
[time=131] It could be 15 people in a living room on a Wednesday night.
[time=135] It could be a Sunday morning community here on our campus.
[time=139] But either way, we believe in that smaller setting where relationships are grown and trust is established and authenticity can take place.
[time=148] We believe in those smaller settings, God grows his people in amazing ways.
[time=154] And then we've got to be a people who having received and benefited from all of that.
[time=158] We've got to be a people who go.
[time=159] And that going may be across the street to paint the fence of an old widow lady.
[time=166] The going may be downtown to help feed those who are hungry.
[time=169] The going may be to hold a baby dying of AIDS in Nairobi.
[time=174] The going could be a lot of things, but we want to be a people who go.
[time=178] And that's really what we want to invite you to be a part of.
[time=182] That's all we're about.
[time=183] It's really become that simple and that focused.
[time=186] And we believe with all of our hearts that that is an endeavor that God can use to change the world.
[time=192] And we want to be used of him to do that very thing.
[time=195] So hey, think about it, would you?
[time=197] We'd love for you to come and gather with us.
[time=200] We'd love for you to come and connect in smaller settings.
[time=202] We'd love to be going with you.
[time=205] And it is a great, great journey, one that is changing our lives and changing the spirit and the scope of our ministry.
[time=213] And I can't wait for more and more of you to come and join us, this growing and diverse community of disciples, Jesus imitators.
[time=224] It's an amazing ride.
[time=225] We hope you'll come by and check it out.
[time=227] God bless you.
[time=228] Thank you for tuning in this morning.
[time=230] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=232] [MUSIC - 141 seconds]
[time=378] - We're gonna take a few minutes here and do this.
[time=383] Neil, would you come on up, Neil and Bob and Dorothy?
[time=387] I want some folks to come up this morning.
[time=390] We've been talking about how at Blackhawk, we are so grateful that God is raising up and God is doing an amazing thing.
[time=397] As he kind of creates in us this further desire to be a community of diverse disciples.
[time=406] We've really gotten clear in recent days around here.
[time=409] It's the one thing we wanna do.
[time=411] We wanna be about raising up those who follow after the ways of Jesus.
[time=417] The way that I look at our church, the way our leadership looks at our church, the way we want all of you to look at this great endeavor is as simply as possible.
[time=426] And we've drawn these circles before.
[time=429] I've showed you this slide before, but I want you to realize it's way more than just circles and slides, my friends.
[time=435] We really believe this.
[time=436] We believe God has led us to grow up a family of disciples by gathering to experience and encounter God.
[time=445] We want you to connect in smaller settings.
[time=448] We believe there you can engage in growth.
[time=450] And we want you to go across the street to paint a fence, across town to serve a bowl of soup, across the world to hold a dying baby in Nairobi.
[time=460] This is what we believe God's calling us to invite you to.
[time=465] And in that middle one there, connecting to engage in growth.
[time=468] So very important that this isn't the only time you're with the body.
[time=473] We believe that when you're with the body in a smaller setting where relationships can be formed, where the biblical discussion can get furthered and most importantly where you get to live out that truth.
[time=486] Inside and outside these four walls being disciples, you know, on the ground as it were.
[time=494] These are great settings, these smaller settings, we call them community groups.
[time=498] And we want you to be a part of one.
[time=500] We want you to be a part of one on Sunday morning.
[time=502] We'd love to have you be a part of one during the week, but either way it's vital that you and I experienced this.
[time=508] Neil Clay has been a part of our family here, Neil and Vaughn and their family for 35 years.
[time=514] Neil has continued to invest in me personally and encourage me, Neil and Bill Archer and some others lead a community group on Sunday mornings called the Discovery Class.
[time=524] And I've asked Neil to share a few things about that.
[time=527] There are a number of other options.
[time=528] We'll hear more in the days to come from other options and other settings where you can get connected, but this morning welcome Neil and let him share a little bit with you about discovery.
[time=537] - I'd like for you to share, this is what Kelly said to me.
[time=540] I'd like for you to share what the purpose is of your adult Bible fellowship class.
[time=544] And I'd like whoever you choose to talk briefly about how God has blessed and encouraged them through their involvement in your Sunday morning community group.
[time=552] So we're gonna take just five or six minutes and do that.
[time=555] Bob and Dorothy Reader here, a part of our class and they'll share in just a moment.
[time=559] But first and foremost, I'd be remiss if I didn't say this.
[time=563] Before anything else, I pray that each of you within the sound of my voice will come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior.
[time=571] That's where you start.
[time=573] John 3 16 says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." Then once you know him as Lord and savior, it is only natural for you to worship him.
[time=589] And of course, that's what we're doing here today.
[time=591] We're worshiping him.
[time=593] In this service, we wanna sing his praises and we wanna listen to his word being taught.
[time=599] In James, the first chapter, verse 22 it says, do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves, do what it says.
[time=612] To help us become doers, our church, as Kelly said, has community groups.
[time=619] In church on Sunday mornings, we have seven adult Bible fellowship classes, community groups, some meet at nine, some at 1045.
[time=627] In addition, our church has 20 or 25 community groups that meet in homes during the week.
[time=634] Our comments this morning from Bob and Dorothy and myself are directed to those of you who are not yet participating in a community group and to urge you to give serious consideration to visiting and joining with one.
[time=647] Remember, Kelly asked me to share with you the purpose of our adult Bible fellowship class we call Discovery.
[time=654] But we're not here just to promote Discovery.
[time=656] I'm here to encourage you, Bob and Dorothy are as well, to join a community group, whether it be in a home or at church on Sunday mornings.
[time=663] The purpose in the Discovery class is to study God's word under the teaching of one of the best Bible teachers in our church, Bill Archer, and then to apply God's word in our lives, and also to pray together, and we sing together, and we fellowship together, and we care for one another, and lift one another up, and then we reach out to others in ministry as well.
[time=686] So that's why I've asked Bob and Dorothy to give a more practical application of what has happened in their lives now that they've joined with us in this community group.
[time=695] Bob?
[time=696] - Good morning.
[time=702] What?
[time=705] You go to Sunday school?
[time=708] Isn't that for kids?
[time=709] I was startled without response some years ago to my casual mention that Dorothy and I were now attending Adult Bible Fellowship class at Black Rock.
[time=721] I replied, "Yes, we are, and we love it." Before our decision to give Sunday school for adults a chance, we, like many others, were content to arrive here at the appointed hour for the church service, and then leave immediately after.
[time=739] Here and gone, not realizing that we were missing not only a learning experience, but fellowship with other Christians as well.
[time=750] Despite numerous invitations to try to discovery class, we dragged our feet making quick excuses that we were thinking about it.
[time=761] Finally, the Sunday arrival, we ran out of excuses,
[time=767] and we, more out of curiosity than anything else, joined others in a discovery class.
[time=774] Ever after several classes, we realized this is where we've gone along in the fellowship of like-minded Christians.
[time=785] In previous Sunday school groups of other churches I attended, I was either too timid, imagine me being timid, to ask questions or too embarrassed to admit I didn't have all the answers to basic Christian belief.
[time=803] That notion was quickly dispelled through the patience and encouragement of class teacher Bill Archer in answering my many questions.
[time=815] Hallelujah, my vast open spaces of biblical understanding could now be bridged, and that surely has been the case, and hopefully will continue well into the future.
[time=829] I look forward, I look forward each Sunday to exploring both the old and New Testament books in an ongoing effort to fill in the remaining gaps of my understanding and ultimately to live a more Christ-centered life.
[time=846] Our purpose here today is to invite you to share in this Christ learning experience along with us in our Discovery ABF class or the many others that are available.
[time=862] Thank you.
[time=863] (audience applauds) - Good morning, the best kept secret at Black Hawk
[time=876] that needs to be exposed, ABF Adult Bible Fellowship.
[time=883] I was so spiritually moved upon my first worship service at Black Hawk many years ago.
[time=891] Talent abounds with every aspect of the service.
[time=896] The music program touches my soul, God's message is biblical, and the people encountered are warm and friendly.
[time=907] What more could we ask?
[time=910] Well, we met a couple who before and after each worship service encouraged us to attend the ABF Discovery class.
[time=921] We thought, how nice of them to extend this invitation, but we seemed content to sit, hear the message, the music, and leave.
[time=933] Did I say that we were invited to an ABF?
[time=937] Yes, over and over and over.
[time=942] We weakened, we did attend the Discovery class and quickly realized what we were missing.
[time=951] The Bible teaching, well, let's just say we didn't understand how thirsty we had been.
[time=959] We heard those divine ancient words over and over from childhood on, but these words and explanations took on new meaning, especially the book of Revelation.
[time=975] We became a part of a community where fellowship, love, caring, support in good and bad times, meals delivered to nurture members during illnesses
[time=990] and visits made to hospitals by many of the class members to lend encouragement.
[time=999] We now ask ourselves, why had we waited so long to join such a supportive group?
[time=1007] What a blessing to know people in Christ who care so much.
[time=1012] God bless that persistent couple who never tired of inviting us to ABF.
[time=1020] Bob and I have been so blessed.
[time=1024] We are here today to encourage you to become a part of an ABF group and experience the many blessings as a result.
[time=1034] (audience applauds) - Thanks, Bob and Dorothy.
[time=1040] Let me conclude this quickly.
[time=1042] Let me share a couple of verses of scripture with you that apply here.
[time=1045] Hebrews 10, verses 23 through 25.
[time=1049] The word says, "Let us hold unswervingly "to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful "and let us consider how we may spur one another on "toward love and good deeds.
[time=1062] "Let us not give up meeting together "as some are in the habit of doing, "but let us encourage one another "and all the more as you see the day approaching." The day is approaching, friends, right, amen?
[time=1075] So I have these questions for you if you're not now in a community group.
[time=1079] One, are you meeting together with fellow believers?
[time=1083] That's what the word instructs us to do.
[time=1085] Two, are you spurring one another on toward love and good deeds?
[time=1089] That's what the word says.
[time=1091] And three, are you encouraging one another?
[time=1094] This is what we all are to be doing as we see the day approaching.
[time=1100] That's what the word says.
[time=1101] So come join us in the discovery class or pick another community group, be it in a home or on Sunday mornings here.
[time=1108] Come and join with us and begin to revitalize your faith and become a doer and not just a listener.
[time=1116] (audience applauds) - Hey, just a reminder to you.
[time=1125] As we've been saying all along, we're trying to model what we're doing here after the way of Jesus.
[time=1131] Jesus grew disciples in community.
[time=1135] Jesus grew disciples in a smaller setting.
[time=1138] Jesus did a lot of public speaking.
[time=1141] Jesus did a lot of teaching to the masses.
[time=1144] Those three, those 12, those 70, they got grown, they got matured, they got deepened in their faith in a smaller setting and that's why it's so very important.
[time=1156] As we try to become a diverse community of disciples, Jesus imitators.
[time=1161] So important that every one of you give thought to connecting in a smaller setting.
[time=1164] Let us know, I mean it, let us know.
[time=1167] Come talk to me this morning, give us a call this week, we wanna help you make that connection.
[time=1171] And again, let me say this about Neil and Bob and Dorothy, you may look at their age and think that that community's just for like, you know, older, wiser people.
[time=1181] There's a number of folks in their community that are young, like me, young, like really young.
[time=1187] There's a number of folks in that community, seriously.
[time=1191] You know, young parents, singles, I mean, it's just a very diverse group and you would love it and there are other community groups on a Sunday morning that I'm sure you'd love to connect with, give it some thought, let us help you if we can.
[time=1202] Hey, open up your Bibles this morning if you would to the book of Genesis.
[time=1205] We continue in our series today, seven timeless stories from the book of Genesis.
[time=1211] Is God still at work in anxious times?
[time=1214] We believe he is and we believe God is at work in anxious times today because God's always been at work in anxious times.
[time=1223] God's always been at work in anxiety in the midst of difficulty and trial from the very beginning of time and that's what that word, Genesis means.
[time=1232] It means beginning.
[time=1234] You know, in our studies so far, we've come across a number of different characters.
[time=1238] We've come across Adam.
[time=1239] We've seen Eve.
[time=1240] We've studied and looked at Abraham.
[time=1242] We've seen Isaac and there has been, really my friends, a common theme.
[time=1247] Well, there've been several, but there has been one common theme, that we've seen again and again.
[time=1254] And it comes up today in our study as well.
[time=1257] This common theme has been man's tendency to lean.
[time=1262] That's right, to lean.
[time=1264] We referenced a passage from Proverbs three,
[time=1270] few weeks ago, Proverbs three, five and six.
[time=1274] Anybody wanna, well, let's just go there actually.
[time=1280] Can rattle it off, but let's just read it.
[time=1282] Proverbs three, five and six.
[time=1284] I wanna make sure you just kind of have it, have it there in your mind.
[time=1289] Proverbs three, five and six.
[time=1296] You got it?
[time=1297] It says they're trusting the Lord with all your heart.
[time=1303] Everybody turn there.
[time=1304] Proverbs three, five and six.
[time=1306] Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[time=1311] And do not what?
[time=1313] Do not lean, it says, on your own understanding.
[time=1318] In all of your ways, instead of leaning on you, instead of leaning on your mind, instead of leaning on your wit, instead of leaning on your giftedness, instead of leaning on your ability to figure things out, in the midst of whatever it is you and I might face, in all your ways, acknowledge who.
[time=1341] Lean on who?
[time=1344] Him, in all your ways, acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths what?
[time=1349] Yeah, we've bumped into some leaners in the last several weeks and they've been leaning the wrong way time and time again.
[time=1358] And today we come to, in this ongoing study, we come to the story, the ongoing unfolding story of Jacob.
[time=1366] We come two generations down the line from Abraham to his grandson, Jacob, the one who God said he would continue the blessing through in keeping with the covenant that God had made with Abraham in Genesis 12.
[time=1382] God had promised Abraham that he would make of him a great nation.
[time=1386] Jacob here is the one who God is going to continue this blessing through.
[time=1390] As we pick it up here in Genesis, turn to Genesis 30, go to 31, if you will, when you come to Genesis 31, what's happening is that Jacob is now at the end of what has been a very long and difficult and confusing 20 years of labor under the hand of Laban, and now God has spoken, and now it's time for Jacob to return to the promised land.
[time=1415] It's time for Jacob to come back to this place that God had promised.
[time=1419] God says it himself, look there in 31, 13.
[time=1422] Genesis 31, 13, he just says, I am the God of Bethel where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to me.
[time=1429] Now he says to Jacob, arise, leave this land and return to the land of your birth.
[time=1439] God wants Jacob back in the promised land, but here's the issue.
[time=1444] Here's where it gets interesting, here's where it gets uncertain, here's where fear sets in, here's where the anxious time kind of gets defined in our study today.
[time=1455] Jacob knows right there at the get-go that if he's going back to the promised land that there is one whom he is going to have to encounter, there is one whose path he is gonna have to cross, and that one is his brother who, Esau.
[time=1471] And for those of you that know the story, you understand what a terrifying reality that would be.
[time=1477] For those of you who don't know the story, just real quick, understand that the relationship between Jacob and Esau to this point has been strained, to say the least.
[time=1485] You would remember back in Genesis 25, Jacob got Esau to sell his own birthright to Jacob over a bowl of soup, and that didn't go so well.
[time=1499] Jacob, then Jesse, and I'm so thankful for Jesse, by the way, if you were here last week, you just were able to experience just some phenomenal teaching.
[time=1507] I'm so grateful for Jesse Hannah and the leadership that he gives our student ministries and his message for us all last week.
[time=1514] Jesse took us through the account of Jacob deceiving Isaac and stealing the blessing that Isaac had wanted to give to Esau.
[time=1523] So he rips him off on the birthright front.
[time=1526] He rips him off on the blessing front.
[time=1530] This didn't leave Esau in a good frame of mind, let's say.
[time=1534] You can go back to Genesis 27, 27, 41, and 42.
[time=1540] You kind of want to ask the question, so how's Esau doing once you think about all this?
[time=1544] Why would Jacob be so terrified to cross his path again now as he makes his way back home?
[time=1550] So, verse 41, so Esau bore a grudge.
[time=1554] No kidding, against Jacob.
[time=1557] Because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, the days of mourning for my father are near, then I will kill my brother.
[time=1565] How's he doing?
[time=1566] He's upset, he's angry.
[time=1569] Then I will kill my brother, Jacob.
[time=1573] Now, when the words of her elder son, Esau, were reported to Rebecca, she sent and called her younger son, Jacob, and said to him, "Behold, your brother, Esau, "is consoling himself concerning you "by planning to kill you." So this is what Jacob believes he's up against in Jacob's human mind, in Jacob's fleshly understanding of the circumstance.
[time=1600] He is pretty convinced that while God has him going back, what he's going back to as a brother, who is absolutely outraged and is going to kill him.
[time=1609] And so watch what God does, this is amazing.
[time=1613] And before I show you what God does, let me just try to make this as personal and practical as I can this morning.
[time=1619] Jacob is on his way by God's command into a circumstance filled with uncertainty and fear.
[time=1628] So I wanna just give you the opportunity.
[time=1632] I don't know how this plays out in your life today, but I would guess there's a way in which God wants to play this teaching out in your life today.
[time=1641] So my question for you today, before we go any further is this, what circumstance in your life today, what is it God has commanded you to do?
[time=1652] What is it that God has called you clearly to pursue?
[time=1657] What is it that he's wanting you to stay at?
[time=1660] What conversation do you need to have with a friend whose relationship with you is broken?
[time=1668] What difficult marriage, is he calling you to as a part of that marriage, stay at and continue to give yourself to selflessly?
[time=1679] Whose business is in trouble and you're not sure where it's going and you fear the worst and yet God has said continue to go forward and trust me.
[time=1688] I mean, I just want you to think for a moment about you in your life and your circumstance.
[time=1693] Is there anything God is calling you to?
[time=1696] Is there any road he's asking you to walk and literally honestly this morning before God you would admit it's kind of a scary road.
[time=1704] So I want you to think about that this morning.
[time=1708] I want you to benefit from understanding Jacob's context but I want Jacob's context to speak into the reality of yours.
[time=1716] You're with me, so think about that.
[time=1719] Now watch what God does, it's amazing.
[time=1722] He commands Jacob to go back home.
[time=1724] Jacob begins this fearful, apprehensive journey home and an amazing thing happens, Genesis 32.
[time=1735] Genesis 32, one and two.
[time=1739] Says, "Now, as Jacob went on his way, "the angels of God met him." Stop right there.
[time=1749] As Jacob goes on his way to this fearful, uncertain setting,
[time=1757] the angels of God meet him.
[time=1761] They really did.
[time=1764] And I want you to think about what that would be like for you.
[time=1768] I want you to understand in your mind what that would literally be like if the difficult circumstance, just for instance, if the difficult circumstance that you chose this morning or if it were me and there was a friend of mine and our relationship was broken and I knew it wasn't right and I knew I needed to go and talk to this individual.
[time=1792] I knew it had gotten to that point.
[time=1793] God was telling me, go, speak with him.
[time=1796] I mean, it would be as if I picked up the phone, called him and he said, yeah, that'd be fine.
[time=1802] Drive over to his house and as I pull in the driveway, there's a legion of heavenly angels encircling the guy's house.
[time=1810] How would you feel?
[time=1815] I think I feel pretty good about it.
[time=1820] I'd say that's a decent sign that this might go well.
[time=1823] The angels of God meet him
[time=1829] and he said, when he saw this, this is God's camp.
[time=1834] And he named that place Mahanai, Genesis 32,
[time=1840] verses one to two, Mahanai means two camps.
[time=1843] Obviously, Jacob was inferring to the camp of his people and the camp of God's angels.
[time=1851] Reminds me of Elisha, turning your Bibles to 2 Kings 6, if you would go ahead, everybody turn there.
[time=1858] 2 Kings 6, it's exactly, you know, the same thing we see going on with Elisha and his servant.
[time=1867] Though the opposing forces appeared overwhelming, Elisha makes the point that if the young man, if the young servant's eyes were truly opened, they would be hold on his side.
[time=1879] Remember the armies of heaven, 2 Kings 6, 15 to 17.
[time=1883] Now, when the attendant, the servant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was circling the city, trouble brewing, doesn't look good.
[time=1896] And his servant said to Elisha, said to him, "Alas, my master, what shall we do?" And Elisha answered, "Do not fear for those great, great line here, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them." Then Elisha prayed and said, "Oh, Lord, I pray open his eyes that he may see, and the Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he saw and behold, what did he see?
[time=1923] The mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire, all around Elisha." Second Kings 6, amazing story, true story.
[time=1938] I wonder, I wonder how many times your fear.
[time=1943] I wonder how many times your uncertainty about a situation would have subsided if your eyes and mine had been opened.
[time=1953] If we had been able to, with spiritual eyes, see what was ahead instead of just simply seeing them with our own.
[time=1962] David wrote, you can write this down, Psalm 34-7.
[time=1966] Psalm 34-7, David wrote, "The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him and rescues them.
[time=1974] He encamps around those who trust him and delivers them."
[time=1980] Now I want you to think about this.
[time=1985] For Jacob, this vision of divine protection, coming as it did at a time of perceived danger and great fear could have really truly in a pretty significant way sustained him.
[time=1999] You with me?
[time=2000] It could have really encouraged him.
[time=2003] It could have, this vision of angels around him could have brought great comfort.
[time=2009] And here my friends is the problem that the text presents.
[time=2013] Here is the challenge that we bump into again with Jacob.
[time=2018] It did encourage him.
[time=2022] It did sustain him.
[time=2024] It did bring strength up to a point, just up to a point.
[time=2029] We read that Jacob immediately, it's right here in the text,
[time=2039] immediately after seeing the angels, then took his own steps to ensure his safety and success.
[time=2047] He sends messengers ahead to appeal to his hostile brother, Esau, whom he feared.
[time=2053] Notice the carefully, look at this, the carefully laid out bribes and manipulative wording that is used every step of the way.
[time=2062] Then Jacob, Genesis 32, three through five, 32, three to five.
[time=2067] Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Sarah, the country of Edom.
[time=2075] He also commanded them saying, "Thus you shall say to my Lord, Esau." Thus says your servant Jacob, he's pointed on.
[time=2084] I have so germed with Laban and stayed until now, I have oxen and donkeys and flocks and male and female servants implied all of which I'm giving to you.
[time=2095] And I have sent to tell my Lord that I may find favor in your sight.
[time=2103] We see here, and you can read this on the screen, we see here that true to his lifelong pattern, and it really was a lifelong pattern, Jacob plotted, struggled, and wrestled with difficult circumstances all to his best advantage as he saw it.
[time=2121] He had always done this.
[time=2123] We see in Jacob's attention, one might say, a conflict of faith.
[time=2128] While Jacob demonstrates a trust in God, he always seems to hedge his bet where they plan B.
[time=2135] He seemed to safeguard his faith with trusting in his own conniving and well-placed escape routes, in quote.
[time=2146] Honestly, it reminds me a lot of me.
[time=2149] As I read the story and as I look at his responses
[time=2156] and as I watch him maneuver, it reminds me a lot of me.
[time=2161] It may, in some places, remind you of you, but I know in many places it just continues to remind me of me.
[time=2170] And that passage we began with this morning continues to ring in my ear and yours trust in the Lord with how much of your heart, all of it.
[time=2181] And lean not.
[time=2182] I know you're bright.
[time=2185] I know you're quick on your feet.
[time=2189] I know you can figure things out.
[time=2192] I know you're masterful at coming up with a plan.
[time=2195] But lean not on your own understanding and all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight.
[time=2202] Well, let's keep going in the text, 32, 6 to 8.
[time=2207] The messengers did exactly as Jacob had commanded.
[time=2210] The messengers then returned to Jacob saying, "We came to your brother Esau, he's there." And furthermore, he's coming to meet you and 400 men are with him.
[time=2219] Now Jacob just pops a gasket.
[time=2222] Faith and trust are out the window.
[time=2225] He kicks in the autopilot.
[time=2227] He's greatly afraid and distressed.
[time=2230] And he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two companies for he said, "If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape." At least I figured that out.
[time=2244] He's thinking.
[time=2247] And you can stop there and just think about that specific circumstance.
[time=2250] On the one hand in that day of tribal culture and tribal warfare, you want to give them a little bit of grace.
[time=2258] Anybody in that day who hears that someone's coming toward him with 400 soldiers may kind of get a sense that things might not possibly go real well.
[time=2269] But on the other hand, Jacob had seen the angels.
[time=2275] He drove in the driveway and there on top of the roof of the disgruntled friend were a million angels.
[time=2282] He'd seen them.
[time=2286] So why all the frantic maneuvering?
[time=2289] And that's a good question for me to ask you this morning.
[time=2293] Why in light of what you've seen?
[time=2299] Why all the frantic maneuvering in your life?
[time=2305] We notice in the text that after he does all of his own preparation, after all the maneuvering's been done, after he's laid it all out just the way he thinks it should be.
[time=2315] Then it says the text says, "Then he prays." Then he prays.
[time=2321] 32, 9 to 12, Jacob said, "Oh God of my Father Abraham and God of my Father Isaac, oh Lord, who said to me, return to your country and to your relatives and I will prosper you.
[time=2331] I am unworthy of all the loving kindness and of all the faithfulness which you have shown to your servants." He does remember it.
[time=2339] He is aware of it.
[time=2341] For with my staff, watch this.
[time=2342] For with my staff only I crossed this Jordan and now I have become two companies.
[time=2349] Crossed over the Jordan with a staff.
[time=2352] Now I've become two companies.
[time=2353] We're gonna come back to that.
[time=2354] Deliver me I pray from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children, for you said I will surely prosper you and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which is too great to be numbered.
[time=2372] This prayer reveals this conflict of faith, this prayer even in that one line there in verse 10, really reveals for us the conflict that resided in Jacob and the same conflict that resides in many of us in this room this morning.
[time=2389] Did you see it there?
[time=2390] For with my staff only.
[time=2393] In one sentence he says with my staff only I crossed the Jordan.
[time=2398] That right there shows enormous faith.
[time=2404] That right there is indicative.
[time=2406] It symbolizes the great willingness that he had to with a staff only crossed the Jordan into this land of who knows what was gonna be there.
[time=2418] And the same guy who crosses over with a staff only now is maneuvering like a mad man and it says right there in that one verse with my staff only I have crossed and yet now I have become two companies.
[time=2432] Now I'm going crazy trying to figure out how to help this thing not go south.
[time=2435] It's important that you and I would remember.
[time=2442] I had him put it on the screen.
[time=2444] When facing a present fear, let's come back to your present fear.
[time=2447] Let's come back to what makes this practical for you this morning and let's try and make it that way.
[time=2453] When facing a present fear it is always wise to remember.
[time=2458] It is always wise to think back and reflect on the past evidence of God's guidance and faithfulness.
[time=2467] Do me a favor.
[time=2468] When you get home today, don't do me a favor.
[time=2471] Do yourself a favor.
[time=2472] I've done this before, it's so encouraging.
[time=2475] I think very useful.
[time=2477] When you get home today or tonight on your own or with your family maybe in the morning in your personal abiding time with him before you hit your day at some point in these next several hours, why don't you do this?
[time=2491] Get out of sheet of paper.
[time=2493] Don't do it on the computer, just write it down.
[time=2495] Get a piece of paper.
[time=2497] Get a pen, get a loan.
[time=2499] And before God, just start writing line after line, after line after line of the ways in which he has shown and evidenced his faithfulness to you in recent days.
[time=2511] Start with yesterday, go into the last week, think about the last month.
[time=2516] You may wanna, who knows how far you'll go, but my point is this, when we literally take the time to sit down and remember and reflect and write down specific ways in which he has shown himself to you, to be good and gracious and wise and right and true, it provides for you and I a context to come back to, save that piece of paper or those pieces of paper, fold them up, put them in your Bible, set them on your dress or put them wherever you're gonna see them.
[time=2547] And as you look at that, be reminded about how faithful he's been.
[time=2551] Well, you go back to his prayer.
[time=2558] Having prayed, oh God of my Father Abraham and God of my Father Isaac, oh Lord, who said to me, having prayed that incredible prayer there in nine to 12, one would think, one would assume that Jacob can now finally rest.
[time=2578] Finally, be at peace.
[time=2581] Finally, let it go and go see Esau and let this thing play out.
[time=2589] The way God's gonna allow it to play out, get in the car, drive up the driveway, go knock on the door and have the conversation enough.
[time=2599] He prays the prayer, now he's ready to rest.
[time=2602] Wrong, no.
[time=2606] We're back to leaning.
[time=2608] Jacob continues to make his own plans for his own safety.
[time=2616] He arranged bribes, it's an emissaries ahead with them.
[time=2619] Also careful and calculated as he always had been in an effort to control this thing down to the minute detail.
[time=2628] Look for yourself, look with me at 13 to 21, Genesis 32, 13.
[time=2636] So he spent the night there, then he selected, listen from what he had with him, a presence he's gonna give.
[time=2641] He saw a present now.
[time=2643] Now we're gonna have gifts for his brother Esau.
[time=2646] 200 female goats and 20 male goats, 200 used and 20 rams, 30 milking camels and their cults, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, 10 male donkeys.
[time=2661] He delivered them into the hand of a servants every drove by itself and said to his servants, pass on before me and put a space.
[time=2671] I mean he's choreographing this thing between the droves.
[time=2675] He commanded the one in front saying, when my brother Esau meets you and asks you saying to whom do you belong and where are you going and to whom do these animals in front of you belong, then you shall say these belong to your servant Jacob.
[time=2689] It is a present sent to my Lord Esau and behold, he also is behind this.
[time=2694] Then he commanded also the second drove and the third drove and all those who followed the drove saying after this manner, you shall speak to Esau when you find him and you shall say behold, your servant Jacob also is behind us for he said, I will appear, listen to this wording, for Jacob said, I will appease him.
[time=2716] I am gonna figure this thing out.
[time=2720] I am gonna make sure I will appease him with the present that goes before me, then afterward I will see his face, perhaps he will accept me.
[time=2730] So the present passed on before him while he himself spent that night in the camp.
[time=2737] Wow.
[time=2739] You ever feel that busy trying to run around
[time=2746] and make sure that everything goes the way you think it should go?
[time=2750] Question for you with a lot, and there was a lot.
[time=2756] He thought, with a lot on the line, what won't you do?
[time=2763] Maybe think of it that way.
[time=2764] And where are you willing to just draw the line?
[time=2767] What won't you say?
[time=2769] What plans won't you make?
[time=2773] Here's a couple for you on the screen.
[time=2777] Will you today in this situation you find yourself in?
[time=2781] Will you find yourself in?
[time=2782] Will you cut off?
[time=2783] Will you stop the maneuvering?
[time=2787] Or maybe better said, how far will you go in your effort to really, purely trust God?
[time=2794] Well, off go the, off go the droves,
[time=2801] off go the servants, off go the camels and donkeys and use and sheep and people scripted to say just the right things and he stays behind.
[time=2810] I read this this week.
[time=2812] So after Jacob separates his immediate family for added protection, he then settles in for the night.
[time=2817] There he stayed.
[time=2819] Alone and watching through a dark night of fear.
[time=2826] You ever been here?
[time=2829] Inner turmoil, self-doubts, even perhaps doubts about God.
[time=2834] Time after time, the question would rise in his mind most certainly, what will the morning bring?
[time=2844] Can you relate to that scene?
[time=2845] I can, I've been there with you.
[time=2848] Long agonizing nights of restlessness and fear waiting for an outcome you were so very uncertain and fearful of.
[time=2856] Well, this is where it gets extremely interesting after Jacob kind of goes off on his own, the text.
[time=2863] The next thing we see in the text is that he becomes engaged in a huge fight, really.
[time=2870] Like a wrestling match with a man, a being sent by God.
[time=2875] It seems to go on all night.
[time=2878] Look at 24 and 25, then Jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
[time=2884] The implication there is they wrestled all night long.
[time=2888] They never stopped wrestling.
[time=2891] They're fighting.
[time=2892] And when he saw verse 25, when he saw that he had not
[time=2898] prevailed against him, he touched the socket of his thigh.
[time=2903] So the socket, the being, touches the socket of Jacob's thigh
[time=2909] and the socket of Jacob's thigh was dislocated while he wrestled with him.
[time=2915] Then he said, well, we'll stop there.
[time=2918] At the end of this anguishing effort, we see that at some point the angel dislodges his hip and Jacob must have realized this was an angel, a representative of God.
[time=2931] For the text says that Jacob hangs on to this being with all of his might, won't let him go, pleads for a blessing, 26.
[time=2941] Then he said, let me go, for the dawn is breaking, but he said, I will not let you go unless you bless me.
[time=2947] Think about this now.
[time=2948] Think about what we know to be true about Jacob.
[time=2951] Think about the back and forth we've been experiencing.
[time=2954] Think about this wrestling.
[time=2956] Now we're talking about physical wrestling, but think about the wrestling that was going on in his soul.
[time=2961] Think about this tension, this conflict of faith, this I believe and you're a good God in this.
[time=2966] You know what I'm gonna figure this thing out.
[time=2969] I mean, it's amazing how in theory, kind of in concept we've got this wrestling, but now in this story, the way it plays out, God just is fine.
[time=2976] You know what we're gonna wrestle.
[time=2977] And they wrestled and they wrestled and they wrestled and they wrestled.
[time=2984] And this angel dislodges his hip.
[time=2986] Now he's at a disadvantage.
[time=2989] Now he's been weakened.
[time=2990] Now he's in this place of weakness.
[time=2993] It's really a good place to be.
[time=2997] And he realizes in that moment what you and I, many of us have realized in the past and some of us in the room need to realize this morning that really instead of figuring everything out,
[time=3013] instead of going before God and showing how smart we are, what we desperately need in humility is his blessing.
[time=3019] So he wrestles with God in the end.
[time=3027] You and I know that when that happens, God wins.
[time=3031] God's will wins, God's way wins.
[time=3036] His direction is always best.
[time=3038] You and I may wrestle with that for a night.
[time=3046] There are some of you in this room who have been wrestling with God for months and you just keep fighting it and you just keep doing battle with it.
[time=3057] And at some point, he invites you, I believe, in this story of Jacob to quit wrestling, to from a place of weakness and fear or uncertainty, whatever it might be.
[time=3069] Lean not on your own understanding, but in all your ways, acknowledge him, to trust him and to seek him for the blessing.
[time=3078] It's amazing how the story ends.
[time=3080] Corbin, come on up if you would.
[time=3081] It's an incredible ending to the story.
[time=3085] You can read it there in Genesis 33.
[time=3088] Genesis 33, but he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times
[time=3100] until he came near to his brother, then Esau, verse four, ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept.
[time=3108] So many times, my friends, it's not as bad as we thought it would be.
[time=3114] [AMEN] You ever been there?
[time=3119] Just convinced you had this thing nailed.
[time=3121] Just convinced it was gonna be horrible.
[time=3123] So convinced that you do all this maneuvering.
[time=3126] You do all this leaning on you.
[time=3128] So convinced it's gonna be so bad that you do all this scheming and conniving and then all of a sudden, boom, you get there, not as bad as you thought it would be.
[time=3139] Let me encourage you, trust God this week.
[time=3143] Let me say that to you, church.
[time=3145] Trust God this week.
[time=3147] And when you feel compelled to maneuver and plot,
[time=3154] don't, don't do it.
[time=3159] Don't fight and wrestle.
[time=3160] Remember, remember who you're dealing with.
[time=3165] Remember the faith of God.
[time=3170] Remember the goodness of the Lord.
[time=3173] Remember, pull out that sheet or those sheets of paper and look back on the way in which he has guided.
[time=3179] Look back on the way in which he has blessed.
[time=3183] Look back on the way in which he has walked with you through so much, why in the world would he leave you near?
[time=3189] And I would encourage you this morning to remember.
[time=3194] And I want to encourage you this morning to sing the song as we go.
[time=3197] Would you stand?
[time=3198] Let's not lean on our own understanding.
[time=3203] Let's lean into the faithfulness of our God and let's sing about that faithfulness this morning.
[time=3207] Just sing it, sing it from your heart.
[time=3209] [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=3340] - That encourages you, that encourages you, say amen.
[time=3348] A.S. Corbin plays, let me just leave you with this.
[time=3351] We wouldn't be true to the text if we wouldn't mention this.
[time=3355] And I think it applies to probably a lot of us in the room.
[time=3360] Esau.
[time=3361] He got shafted.
[time=3364] He really got mistreated.
[time=3368] And he also made a bunch of mistakes, we didn't get into his whole story.
[time=3373] But I'm telling you, Esau, Jacob, Esau really got wronged.
[time=3377] You've been wronged.
[time=3381] You've been shafted.
[time=3384] You've been mistreated.
[time=3385] You've been lied about.
[time=3388] I mean, I don't know.
[time=3391] You tell me, I know there are people in this room this morning and you suffer today, but the hurt and the pain of mistreatment and yet his response when face to face with the one who wronged him was what?
[time=3404] Grace.
[time=3406] A kiss on the neck.
[time=3410] Grace.
[time=3413] It's amazing.
[time=3414] It's a great thing for you and I to be reminded of.
[time=3417] Be gracious.
[time=3420] Father God, we pray this morning that your spirit would go with us.
[time=3424] We sense this morning his presence with us, God.
[time=3427] We sense the great power of your word in this story of Jacob, O God, the back and forth, the back and forth.
[time=3434] It just sounds so familiar to me.
[time=3438] Oh, would you strengthen our faith?
[time=3440] Oh, God, would you develop in us just a clear, a clear memory that would be unwavering, strong and stable, God of your faithfulness and your goodness.
[time=3453] And may we lean on you.
[time=3456] Father, bring us back together again next week.
[time=3459] If that be your will, God, bring us together tonight.
[time=3462] If that be your will, may we as a family celebrate your faithfulness in redeeming those who will be in the water tonight being baptized, may we as a family celebrate what you've done and may we do that, God with all our heart and all the people in the room who were encouraged and agreed with the prayer said.
[time=3480] [AMEN] God bless you guys.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
