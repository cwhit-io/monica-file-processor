[time=988] Well, good morning, Blackhawk family.
[time=990] Just a moment if I could introduce to you not only the one who comes this morning with, I believe, a word from the Lord and a great message for you who are here with us today, but a friend, a really, really good friend.
[time=1006] Many of you know because I've shared with you in the past how oftentimes it's difficult to really feel like in ministry that you've got friends, friends that are there for you no matter what friends that are available, friends that are honest, friends that are genuine, friends that don't want anything from you at all, they just want to be your friend.
[time=1028] And it's rare when I come across people like that and for Deborah and I, Al and Karla Jennings have been that very thing.
[time=1036] They have been from day one friends and they have continued to be friends and our families are friends and they have loved us and they have invested in us.
[time=1046] They have been for us exactly what we've needed over the years and I can't tell you how grateful I am for Al Jennings.
[time=1054] He pastors at Summit Ministries International.
[time=1057] It's an amazing church right here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1060] Summit is a place where the Word of God is taught where the arts are celebrated, where relationships are valued.
[time=1069] It's an amazing thing that God's doing through Al and his team and I'm so thankful that he took a Sunday to come and be with us today.
[time=1077] I hope you'll welcome him warmly.
[time=1080] I hope you'll welcome him with a great sense of anticipation for what God has for us today through Al.
[time=1086] Please know how much he means to me and what a friend he has been to our ministry over the years.
[time=1092] So welcome, please, Al Jennings, and you all have a great, great morning.
[time=1096] God bless.
[time=1097] (applause) Thank you so much.
[time=1101] Thank you, big fella, wherever you are.
[time=1104] He's even bigger on the screen than he is in real life.
[time=1108] But I thank you for receiving me.
[time=1111] I'm always well received here.
[time=1114] And I believe today I'll be no exception.
[time=1117] It's a pleasure to stand before you.
[time=1120] I'm filling in some very big shoes and literally and figuratively, okay?
[time=1128] So we're just excited about being here and I want to echo what Kelly said.
[time=1134] Pastor Kelly and Kebra are so dear friends of Carlinas.
[time=1138] And like he said in ministry, it's good to have people that are on the same page with you and you can bounce things off of.
[time=1147] I get so inspired every time I come here, the way you do things and to be able to, how you can get so much into 75 minutes.
[time=1155] We just haven't figured that out yet at Summit Church.
[time=1159] But we're working on it.
[time=1161] And this is just such a wonderful ministry.
[time=1164] You're doing such wonderful things.
[time=1165] And at Summit Church, we just four weeks ago expanded, actually five weeks ago now into Indianapolis.
[time=1171] We have a site.
[time=1173] We're one church now in two locations, Fort Wayne and in Indianapolis.
[time=1177] So needless to say, I'm very, very busy.
[time=1180] But it's always just a blessing to be here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1186] Give yourselves a hand.
[time=1188] (Applause) All right.
[time=1191] So we're going to talk about lessons in overcoming adversity
[time=1197] from the life of Joseph.
[time=1199] I love the story of Joseph and there's some valuable lessons that we can learn.
[time=1203] Anybody ever gone through any trials, tests, tribulations, adversity, all right?
[time=1210] If you're living, you're going to go through something.
[time=1212] And it's very important to have the proper response in the midst of adversity.
[time=1219] In fact, it's what you do in adversity that will determine whether or not you're going to come out of it victorious.
[time=1227] And God wants all of us to be victorious.
[time=1230] The Scripture tells us in Psalm 34, 19 that many are the afflictions
[time=1236] of the righteous, but the Lord delivers us out of them some, out of them few, out of them all.
[time=1246] I know that's not good English, but the Scripture says, "The Lord delivers us out of them all." So I don't care what you're going through.
[time=1251] I can boldly tell you that if God before you, who can be against you?
[time=1257] The Scripture tells us in Romans 8.
[time=1259] And in Romans 8, it also says in verse 37, nay in all these things.
[time=1263] And he mentions a bunch of the things and trials and tests and so on and so forth.
[time=1267] But in all these things, we are as Christians, as believers, as children of God, we are more than conquerors.
[time=1275] All right?
[time=1276] So we're going to begin in Genesis chapter 37 and verse 3.
[time=1282] Now Israel or Jacob loved Joseph more than all his children
[time=1288] because he was the son of his old age.
[time=1292] Also, right from, I mean, right from get-go.
[time=1297] Joseph had favor on his life.
[time=1299] The hand of God was all over him.
[time=1302] And just because the Lord is with you, as he was obviously with Joseph and the Scripture says, he will never leave us or forsake us.
[time=1310] Isn't that comforting from the Word of God that he said, "Lo, I am with you always." That's the reason why some people don't fly on airplanes because they said, "No, God didn't promise he'll be with you in an airplane." And he said, "Lo, I will be with you." No, I don't think that's what the Scripture meant.
[time=1330] But even when the hand of God is on you, you will go through things, but you always have to remember that God is with you.
[time=1338] And so also goes on to say he made him a tunic or coat
[time=1346] of many colors, had a beautiful coat prepared for him.
[time=1350] But when his brother saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, hated him.
[time=1358] You know you got hard times when your own family hates you.
[time=1362] Usually you can run or go to your family for comfort.
[time=1367] But Joseph couldn't even do that.
[time=1370] His brothers hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.
[time=1376] In verse 5, "Now Joseph had a dream and he told it to his brothers and they hated him even more." Seemed like they would be excited because he had a dream from God, but yet they hated him even more.
[time=1390] So he said to them, "Please hear this dream which I have dreamed." There we were, binding sheaves in the field.
[time=1397] Then behold, my sheaves arose and stood upright.
[time=1401] And indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my she.
[time=1407] Now that really gets you in trouble with your brothers, right?
[time=1411] All of you, basically what he's saying going to bow down before me.
[time=1415] And I'm sure they were really excited about that.
[time=1418] And his brother said him, "Shall you indeed reign over us or shall you indeed have dominion over us so they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words." Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers and said, "Look, I have dreamed another dream and this time the sun, the moon and the eleven stars bowed down to me."
[time=1445] Okay? So he told it to his father and his brothers and his father rebuked him.
[time=1451] Now his father is on his case and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed?
[time=1457] Shall your mother and I and your brothers indeed come and bow down to the earth before you?
[time=1465] You are a child.
[time=1467] What? But his brothers envied him but his father kept the matter in mind.
[time=1475] The first lesson that we want to share with you today is you can't share your dream
[time=1481] with everybody.
[time=1484] Everybody's not going, "Hey, Deborah, I didn't know you were here.
[time=1489] Wow, I would have dressed better if I had known you." The one thing you all have helped me to relax, I used to have suit and tie.
[time=1495] Isn't it so easy to get up?
[time=1497] Now there's nothing wrong with suits.
[time=1498] Some of you guys get dressed in suits and tie.
[time=1500] And that's wonderful that you can just come to church and just, there's nothing in the Bible that says what you have to wear, right?
[time=1506] I mean, decent clothes, right, and covered up.
[time=1510] But really, it's good to be able to relax.
[time=1513] It helps me to get a little bit more sleep in on Sunday.
[time=1517] And I don't have to prepare so much.
[time=1520] But anyway, we can't share your dream with everybody.
[time=1524] Everybody's not going to understand what God has shared with you.
[time=1529] And you just open yourself up to unnecessary criticism
[time=1536] when you share your dream and your vision that God has given you with people who can't understand and can't relate.
[time=1542] Sometimes even your own family you can't share things with.
[time=1545] And somebody say amen to that.
[time=1549] So he got himself in a little bit of trouble by sharing his dream
[time=1555] with his brothers and we'll see that a little bit later.
[time=1561] But it's good to share your dreams with people who are close to you, who can relate to you, people that can understand you.
[time=1569] You're very close friends, okay, and believing friends,
[time=1575] people who know God and love God.
[time=1578] So first of all, be cautious about who you share your dream with.
[time=1583] The second lesson is you can't keep a blessed man down.
[time=1589] Let's look at verse 18 in Genesis 37.
[time=1592] "When Joseph's brother saw him coming, they recognized him in the distance and made plans to kill him," that's great, isn't it?
[time=1600] Here comes that dreamer, okay, they're making fun of him now.
[time=1604] Here comes the dreamer, come on, let's kill him and throw him into a deep pit.
[time=1611] Now his own brothers, you're in trouble when your brothers want to kill you.
[time=1615] Well, they changed their mind and decided they weren't going to kill him but they were going to put him in a pit alive and just leave him there.
[time=1622] But then they saw some Ishmaelite traitors passing through so they decided to sell him.
[time=1629] So he sold into slavery, but yet remember, he still has a dream from God.
[time=1636] No matter what you're going through, remember what God has shared with you
[time=1642] by his spirit, by his word, and stay encouraged.
[time=1646] Because I want to encourage you that no matter what you're going through today, God, let this story help you and encourage you and help you understand
[time=1656] that you're going to come out of that situation that you're in.
[time=1658] Turn to the person next to you, I like people to respond.
[time=1662] So sometimes I give you some instructions.
[time=1665] So let me just encourage you to do this.
[time=1668] Turn to the person next to you and say, no matter what you're going through, you're coming out of it.
[time=1671] That makes you feel a little better, doesn't it?
[time=1679] Your words are important.
[time=1680] So you're using your words to encourage somebody.
[time=1683] Turn to another person, your second choice.
[time=1687] Turn to them and tell no matter what you're going through, you're coming out of it.
[time=1692] All right.
[time=1698] So these traitors, these Ishmaelite traitors that he was sold to,
[time=1706] then they sold him to a Potiphar who was an officer of Pharaoh.
[time=1712] And then he began to be a slave in Potiphar's house.
[time=1717] We'll pick up this story in verse one of chapter 39.
[time=1721] Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the God and Egyptian bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.
[time=1731] The Lord was with Joseph.
[time=1736] One time I did a study of heroes, I did a teaching on heroes, and I went through various heroes in the Bible like Abraham, Moses, David, et cetera, and even Joseph.
[time=1749] And one underlying theme that was consistent, the common denominator in all of these great heroes of the Bible that I studied
[time=1759] and what made them successful was the fact, no matter what they've gone through, and they all went through things.
[time=1765] But one common denominator was that the Lord was with them.
[time=1768] That's a key component in your life.
[time=1772] If you can't remember anything else about what I shared, remember this, the Lord.
[time=1778] My message to you today is the Lord is with you and you cannot fail.
[time=1781] Trust him and you make it.
[time=1786] All right, and you can say amen, it doesn't bother me.
[time=1790] All right, now verse two, the Lord was with Joseph and he was a successful man.
[time=1800] And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.
[time=1805] See, don't be afraid of success.
[time=1807] In fact, God wants you to be a success.
[time=1810] There's a success the world's way, but then God has success for you.
[time=1816] See, God's way and the world's way are two different things.
[time=1819] The scripture tells us in Joshua chapter one and verse eight, "This book of the law or the word of God shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it.
[time=1832] For then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have good success."
[time=1839] God wants you to have good success.
[time=1841] See, there's good success and there's bad success.
[time=1844] See, bad success is have a lot of money, but yet your kids don't speak to you.
[time=1849] That's not good success.
[time=1852] Married five times.
[time=1854] And you say, "Well, man, I tell you what, I just always married a wrong woman.
[time=1858] All five of my wives, all of them had the same problem." Yeah, it was you.
[time=1867] See, but God wants us to have good success in every area of our life.
[time=1873] I mean, it's amazing how people, I mean, if you don't know God in ministry,
[time=1879] if you really don't follow after God, you would be tempted to quit the ministry with some of the things that come across your desk.
[time=1885] One time a couple came to me and they said, Pastor, they wanted what I required marriage counseling before I would marry them.
[time=1894] So they would come in my office and both of them had been married before.
[time=1898] And they really kind of had this attitude that they knew it all.
[time=1901] And then finally, they told me, Pastor, we really don't need marriage counseling because both of us have been married before.
[time=1907] [ Laughter ] And that's all I'm going to say about that.
[time=1912] [ Laughter ] But God wants you to have good success.
[time=1918] And so the Lord was with Joseph and that's what causes you to be a success.
[time=1923] To have the Lord with you.
[time=1927] And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian, and his master saw, see when the Lord is with you, people will recognize it.
[time=1936] And it will have an effect on your work and all that you do.
[time=1941] Okay, you're going to be the best at whatever you do.
[time=1944] And that's what Joseph was.
[time=1946] He was the best at whatever he did.
[time=1949] More about that later, but the master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all he did to prosper in his hands.
[time=1958] So Joseph found favor in his sight and served him.
[time=1962] Then he made him overseer over his house.
[time=1965] Potiphar put him over his whole house and all that he had put on --
[time=1971] all that he had, he put under his authority.
[time=1973] So it was from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake.
[time=1985] And the blessing of the Lord was on all that he had in the house and in the field.
[time=1992] Thus he left all that he had in Joseph's hand and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate because he gave Joseph authority over everything and everything was blessed in his house and in the field because of Joseph.
[time=2008] And Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
[time=2012] I like that they put that in there because that's how I can relate to Joseph being.
[time=2017] All right, so number three, the lesson is being the best
[time=2024] in whatever circumstance you're in, you can be the best.
[time=2028] You can rise to the top.
[time=2029] Joseph, as we read this story, I want you to look for this in each passage that we read and study together that Joseph always rose
[time=2041] to the top level of wherever he was.
[time=2043] Now, and you can imagine he could have had a different attitude.
[time=2051] He could have thought to himself, here I am.
[time=2054] I'm sold in slavery.
[time=2055] My own brothers leave me for dead.
[time=2058] Then they sell me.
[time=2059] Now I'm in this guy's house.
[time=2061] I'm in the Egyptian's house.
[time=2063] I'm in some foreign country.
[time=2065] I'm a slave.
[time=2066] He could have held his head down.
[time=2069] Got discouraged like some of you may be right now.
[time=2073] You may be in a situation.
[time=2075] But as I said earlier, it's important to have the proper response when you're in adversity.
[time=2082] It's not time to hold your head down.
[time=2084] It's time to look up.
[time=2086] It's time to trust God.
[time=2088] It's time to put God to the test because he will see you through.
[time=2093] Be encouraged today.
[time=2096] And be positive.
[time=2098] See, and stay positive.
[time=2102] See, you have to learn to say the right things.
[time=2107] Jesus said that if you have faith as a seed, in Matthew 1720,
[time=2113] I believe if you have faith as a seed, you will say to this mountain, move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible to you.
[time=2121] You need to know how to if you're married, you have a family and you're going through some financial difficulty.
[time=2126] You need to know how to stand in the middle of your home and call your family together and say, listen, we're going to make it.
[time=2131] This mountain that we're facing right now, it's going to move.
[time=2135] And see, sometimes people say, well, that sounds like a positive thinking to me.
[time=2140] That sounds like motivational thinking.
[time=2143] Guess what it is?
[time=2144] Because all positive thinking and motivational speakers to talk about all this positive stuff, all that stuff comes out of the Bible, talking about being positive.
[time=2156] Those success principles, all true success principles come out of the Bible.
[time=2162] See, Jesus said if you have faith as a seed, he'll say, Jesus didn't go around saying when the disease people were brought to him and demon possessed people, all kind of problems in the three and a half years of Jesus walked the earth.
[time=2174] People came to him with all kind of difficulty and questions.
[time=2177] He never said, oh, man, that's a hard situation right there.
[time=2180] I don't know how we're going to get through this.
[time=2182] I don't know how we're going to get these people healed.
[time=2183] I don't know how we're going to get these demons all these forward.
[time=2186] I don't know.
[time=2187] I'm kind of scared of myself.
[time=2188] No, Jesus always had the proper response.
[time=2191] He said, okay, let's deal with this.
[time=2195] Come out of that man in the name of Jesus, but just come out of the man.
[time=2199] All right.
[time=2200] So Jesus was positive, okay?
[time=2204] And so we ought to be positive.
[time=2206] Paul picked up on that.
[time=2207] He had that spirit of faith.
[time=2210] He said, we having the same in 2 Corinthians 4, 13, we having the same spirit of faith.
[time=2217] We believe and therefore have spoken.
[time=2220] I believe and therefore speak.
[time=2222] See what you believe from God's Word, speak it and say it.
[time=2226] And it will come to pass.
[time=2228] So you can't hold your head down and talk about how bad things are.
[time=2233] Well, the economy is bad.
[time=2234] What are you going to do?
[time=2236] I mean, things are changing and people are laying off, companies
[time=2242] are laying off people by the truckload, okay, and they're cut backs and layoffs.
[time=2247] So what are you going to do?
[time=2249] What you should do?
[time=2250] Be the best at every situation that you're in.
[time=2253] Then number four, the blessing and favor of God.
[time=2258] We see that the blessing of God was on Joseph, that he was in Potiphar's house and yet he rose to the top level.
[time=2267] He was over everything in Potiphar's house because of that blessing and the favor of God, everybody say the favor of God.
[time=2274] See, the Bible talks about favor, that we're crowned in Psalm 8 5, I believe it says, we're crowned with glory and honor.
[time=2282] You've got a crown of favor on you, okay?
[time=2288] Sometimes people criticize Joel Osteen.
[time=2290] He's always smiling and happy and telling everybody they're going to make it.
[time=2295] And you know why people gravitate to that because people are looking for hope in these trying times.
[time=2300] It's not that you don't go through things.
[time=2301] We all go through things, but you've got to have the right attitude in the midst of what you're dealing with and going through and hope is a powerful thing.
[time=2311] You can't don't lose your hope no matter what you're dealing with, no matter what you're going through.
[time=2318] So there's a principle number 5, the principle of diligent work.
[time=2323] Like I said, there's companies that are laying off people, it's happening all the time in these days.
[time=2328] But what you need to do is be the best.
[time=2331] Make yourself invaluable to your employer.
[time=2334] Be the best at what you do.
[time=2337] I believe Joseph didn't just happen to go right to the top of wherever he was.
[time=2344] I believe he started with some very menial tasks.
[time=2347] They gave him something little to do.
[time=2349] And he was successful at it, so they gave him a promotion.
[time=2352] And then he took that job and was successful at that job.
[time=2357] And then they promoted him.
[time=2358] I believe he was the best.
[time=2360] And he did whatever they gave him to the best of his ability.
[time=2364] And it's not just about having God with you and having God's hand on your life.
[time=2369] You always or you also should be very diligent on your job,
[time=2376] on your business, even if you're a business owner.
[time=2379] See, people are going to want to do business with their best businesses.
[time=2384] So if you want to separate your business from other businesses, you want your business to stand out.
[time=2388] If you're a business owner, be the best at what you do.
[time=2391] If you're a worker and you work for a company, be the best.
[time=2394] Because the first people that they lay off, and the first people that, when it comes to cutbacks, are the people who are lazy and the people that are not doing anything.
[time=2402] That's a no-brainer.
[time=2405] See, so you need to make yourself invaluable.
[time=2409] I believe Christians ought to be the best workers on the job.
[time=2411] We ought to stand out because the hand of God is honest.
[time=2414] Be the best at what you do.
[time=2415] And even if you do get laid off, God will open up something else for you.
[time=2418] It's not the end of the world.
[time=2420] When you make yourself valuable, somebody is always employers-- I'm an employer.
[time=2426] Employers are always looking for people who are good.
[time=2431] And they're going to keep around people that they can't do without.
[time=2434] Make yourself one of those people that your boss, your employer, cannot do without.
[time=2438] Can somebody say amen?
[time=2441] In verse 7 in chapter 39, thank you.
[time=2447] And it came to pass after these things that his master's wife-- here we got something else going on now.
[time=2456] His master's wife-- remember, he's good-looking now.
[time=2461] And I believe his master's.
[time=2462] I believe Potiphar's wife was also fine.
[time=2465] And I guess she got a little bored.
[time=2467] She did all the shopping she could do.
[time=2468] And she's just sitting around kind of bored around the house.
[time=2473] Got tired of watching all the soap operas and things like that.
[time=2475] And she noticed Joseph doing some things in the house.
[time=2481] I don't need to-- I mean, it really looks like episode of desperate housewives.
[time=2486] So I don't need to watch soap operas and desperate housewives to see some juicy stuff.
[time=2491] You can see there's a whole lot of juicy stuff in the Bible.
[time=2494] And here's one of them.
[time=2496] It came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast longing eyes on-- what is it-- casting longing eyes?
[time=2502] I mean, hey, let's get it on, all right?
[time=2506] That's kind of '70s, really.
[time=2508] I mean, she wanted to get with it, OK?
[time=2511] She wanted to have sex with him, OK?
[time=2515] Let's just be real.
[time=2516] And I don't know if-- I might not get invited back after saying that, but can I say the S word in here, OK?
[time=2522] But she said, hey.
[time=2525] And she-- I mean, she got straight to the point.
[time=2527] She said, hey, lie with me.
[time=2529] Obviously, her husband wasn't at home.
[time=2531] And she said, hey, lie with me.
[time=2532] But being the man of God that he was, he refused.
[time=2537] And you need to understand when you're tempted.
[time=2541] One of the great sexual-- one of the great temptations in this day and age is sexual temptation.
[time=2549] I mean, it used to be-- you'd have to hunt for pornography when I was growing up.
[time=2555] I mean, you had to get a playboy from somewhere and sneak it in the house.
[time=2560] Now, you can get it 24/7 on the internet.
[time=2564] I mean, it's a big issue in these days.
[time=2567] And you need to know how to stay-- you need to stay holy, stay in the Word of God,
[time=2574] and guard yourself, guard your heart against the temptation
[time=2580] of men and even women of getting online and peeking at pornography, because I mean, some of this stuff you don't have to look for, it will find you.
[time=2591] You get all kind of crazy emails and things like that from all these stupid places, trying to lure you into a trap of sexual sin.
[time=2600] And you need to know how to guard yourself with God's word.
[time=2604] Read the Bible every day, see?
[time=2607] And don't think you can't succumb to it, because you can, but you don't have to.
[time=2614] And you shouldn't if you guard yourself with God's word.
[time=2617] And so, Joseph guarded his heart.
[time=2620] And it goes on to say that when he refused and he said to his master's wife, look, my master does not know what is with me in the house.
[time=2629] And he has committed all that he has to my hand.
[time=2631] There's no one greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but you.
[time=2641] I can have everything else, but I can't touch you.
[time=2644] And watch this, very important statement.
[time=2647] Because you are his wife.
[time=2650] How then can I do this great wickedness and sin
[time=2656] against God?
[time=2658] Adultery is not just sin against your spouse or somebody else's spouse.
[time=2664] It is a sin against God.
[time=2666] And Joseph understood that.
[time=2668] And that brings us to our next lesson is honor.
[time=2672] Joseph was a man of honor, integrity, and holiness.
[time=2677] He was a holy man.
[time=2680] And even though you're holy and you're right with God, sometimes things just don't go your way.
[time=2686] But in the end, remember, in the end, you will come out victorious if you continue to trust God.
[time=2692] And so this woman got upset.
[time=2696] And one day, I'll pick it up in verse 10.
[time=2700] So it was that she spoke to Joseph day by day.
[time=2703] I mean, this wasn't just a one-time thing.
[time=2705] Every day she's hitting on him.
[time=2709] But he did not heed her to lie with her or to be with her.
[time=2713] He kept his honor, he kept his holiness, kept his integrity.
[time=2719] But I'm going to skip down to verse 16.
[time=2723] What had happened was one day he was working in the house.
[time=2726] And finally, I mean, she just got real aggressive.
[time=2729] And she grabbed his garment and said, hey, lie with me.
[time=2732] And so Joseph, you know, the Bible says flee for an occasion.
[time=2736] When you find yourself, young men, young women, or anybody for that matter, you're in a situation, and something starts to jump off, and it's not right.
[time=2745] And somebody wants to have sex with you, and you're in a situation, you might be alone with them.
[time=2749] Get, first of all, don't get along with them in the first place.
[time=2754] But if you get in a situation like that, get out of there as quickly as you can.
[time=2761] I don't care if the party is hot or what's going on, if some crazy mess is going on, young people, get up out of that party.
[time=2768] And Joseph got up out of there.
[time=2771] Okay, I mean, with his garment left in her hand.
[time=2775] I mean, he had a shirt or something, was still in her hand, and he stormed out just to avoid her.
[time=2781] But yet, being the wicked person that she was, she created a scene, called a man to come in the house, said, look, this Hebrew has come in to mock us.
[time=2791] He came in here and tried to rape me, lying through her teeth, right?
[time=2796] And finally, she obviously tells her husband, a pot of her, who throws him into the jail, into prison.
[time=2805] Okay, in verse 16, so she kept his garment with her until his master came home then.
[time=2810] She spoke to him with words like these, saying this Hebrew, serve it, I already said all that.
[time=2816] Let's drop down to point number eight.
[time=2820] Getting bitter, okay,
[time=2826] I didn't give you number seven.
[time=2827] Dealing with false accusation, you need to know how to deal with when somebody accuses you falsely.
[time=2835] And this is how Joseph dealt with it.
[time=2837] He used every situation that came his way, instead of getting bitter, he got better.
[time=2847] So lesson number eight is, in any situation that you're in,
[time=2854] don't allow the situation to make you bitter, use the situation to make you better.
[time=2860] Now, here is Joseph being thrown in prison.
[time=2866] And this is an outstanding character trait that was consistent throughout Joseph's life.
[time=2873] When life throws some hard stuff at you,
[time=2881] remember to allow that adversity in your life to make you better, use it, negative things, negative circumstances, trials and tests, use them as stepping stones to go even higher and trust God even more.
[time=2899] Use them as stepping stones to make you stronger.
[time=2906] Circumstances are not necessarily going to make you stronger just because of the circumstance.
[time=2914] Circumstances, like you are surrounded.
[time=2919] It's kind of like those old cowboys and Indians, where, I mean, you got all around you, you're surrounded.
[time=2927] Indians are surrounding you and you're the cowboys and you watch some of those old cowboy movies.
[time=2934] Are they gonna come out of that situation or not when they're surrounded by Indians?
[time=2937] It well, it depends.
[time=2939] It depends on if you've got the goods to get you out.
[time=2942] You have the firepower to get you out.
[time=2945] See, and trusting God is the firepower and understanding that the Lord is with you.
[time=2949] Having a positive attitude is the firepower that you need to get you out.
[time=2954] You cannot afford when you're going through things to hold your head down, lift your head up and trust God.
[time=2961] And start to say, man, we're coming out of this situation and we're coming out victorious.
[time=2968] And once you come, the good news is, once you come through the adversity victorious, you're going to be stronger to face even the next situation and the next trial and test and circumstance that comes against you.
[time=2982] You'll be stronger each time after you come out successfully of each adversity, okay?
[time=2990] Then number nine is understand that the Lord is with you.
[time=2997] And we've talked about that.
[time=2999] The Lord is with you no matter what you're going through.
[time=3003] In verse 21, it says, but the Lord, even in prison, watch this, the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor, the hand of God never left, the favor of God never left, the Lord never left Joseph no matter what he was going through.
[time=3022] We're gonna see a similar thing happen in prison that happened in Potiphar's house.
[time=3026] The Lord gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand, all the prisoners who were in the prison.
[time=3037] The jailer put Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners.
[time=3043] Now that's an unusual thing to happen in prison, but he recognized that the Lord was with him and I believe the same thing happened as happened in Potiphar's house.
[time=3051] The jailer probably gave him some small things to do and he did them successfully and the jailer was probably amazed at what he did to how he handled it.
[time=3061] So he got promoted and he kept getting promoted till he was over all the prisoners.
[time=3067] The keeper of the prison did not look, verse 23, into anything that was under Joseph's authority because the Lord here it is again, the Lord was with him and whatever he did, the Lord made it prosper.
[time=3081] See, when the hand of God is on you and you allow him to cause you to be the pest at whatever you do, the Lord will prosper everything in your hand.
[time=3094] Well, while he was in prison, he ran across a former Chief Baker
[time=3102] and a Chief Butler who was the Chief Butler and Chief Baker for Pharaoh and Pharaoh had got angry with him and threw him in prison.
[time=3112] Well, he got to know these guys in prison and so the Baker and the Butler both had some dreams, they both had a dream and which Joseph interpreted the dream of the Baker and the Butler and his interpretation came true.
[time=3130] Unfortunately, it didn't work out too good for the Baker because he got his head cut off and in pale, but he interpreted also the dream of the Butler
[time=3142] and the interpretation of that dream was that he was going to be restored to his former position with Pharaoh as the Chief Butler or cup bearer.
[time=3152] But Joseph told him when he interpreted his dream, he said, "Mr. Butler, once you get back into your position, "don't forget about me 'cause, you know, I'm here on justly "and I really shouldn't be in this prison, "I didn't do anything wrong." So remember me when you get before Pharaoh, but sometimes what happens when people get promoted and God elevates them, they forget where they came from and they forget about the people that helped him along the way and that's what happened to the Butler.
[time=3177] He forgot all about Joseph, okay?
[time=3180] But again, God's hand is still on Joseph and it happened later on that the Pharaoh had a very disturbing,
[time=3191] troubling dream that none of his magicians, none of his chief advisors, nobody could interpret, nobody could tell him what the dream meant.
[time=3199] He's very disturbed by it, very frustrated by it.
[time=3202] And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden, the Butler remembered Joseph and he said, "Oh, Pharaoh, by the way, I remember my faults now, "there's a guy in prison that interpreted my dream "and interpreted the baker's dream "and what he said came true." So Pharaoh went and got him out of prison.
[time=3222] To interpret his dream and make a long story short, he interpreted that dream.
[time=3226] I mean, he was spot on, interpreted the dream successfully.
[time=3230] Everything that Joseph told him came to pass and he was the result.
[time=3234] He went from the pit.
[time=3237] Remember, he was back in the pit that his brothers threw him in.
[time=3240] God brought him from the pit and took him to the palace.
[time=3246] That's what happens when you trust God.
[time=3248] And in verse 42, excuse me, verse 39, "Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'Inasmuch as God "'as shown you all this, there's no one as discerning "'and wise as you.
[time=3261] "'You shall be over my house, and all my people "'shall be ruled according to your word, "'only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.'" And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you "over all the land of Egypt." Remember what we said before in times living well on me, but you can never keep a blessed man down and you are a blessed person.
[time=3284] And nothing can hold you back when you trust God.
[time=3288] And when you realize that the Lord is with you and he's gonna make you more than a conqueror.
[time=3294] The scripture says, "In all these things, "we're more than a conqueror.
[time=3297] "Thanks be to God who always, always causes us." You ever see my car and I got a license plate, it says always, that's what that means.
[time=3305] People ask me that all the time.
[time=3306] You work for Walmart, I said, "No." So what does that mean?
[time=3309] No, that means that God, one of my favorite scriptures, God always causes us to triumph.
[time=3313] And that's what he did in Joseph's life.
[time=3315] And then Pharaoh took off his signant ring off his hand and put it on Joseph's hand.
[time=3322] And he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck, gave him some bling, man.
[time=3330] And he said, and he had him ride in a second chariot which he had, and they cried out before him, bow the knee, so he set him over all the land of Egypt's.
[time=3339] Pharaoh also said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, "and without your consent, no man may lift his hand "or a foot in all the land of Egypt." Every head bowed every eye closed.
[time=3350] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[time=3353] We thank you for God's people.
[time=3357] And Lord, we love you.
[time=3358] We're here because we wanna know you better so we can follow you more faithfully.
[time=3364] And Lord, if there's anybody here who doesn't know you who has not made Jesus the Lord of their life, Father, we pray that they're coming to a saving relationship with you, with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3379] And anybody here, Father, who's going through adversity, going through trials and tests and situations, Lord, the trials of life are common to us all.
[time=3388] There's no temptation that's taken us, but such is as common to man.
[time=3392] But your word says that you're faithful, who will not allow us to be tempted above, which we are able, but will with the temptation, make a way of escape.
[time=3400] Thank you, Lord, for giving us a way of escape out of all the trouble and all the problems that we may be going through right now, Lord.
[time=3407] And we know that your word says that many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord, you, Father God, deliver us out of them all.
[time=3413] Father, I pray that your delivering power will work in each and every person, Father God, and your power will prevail to bring each and every person, going through adversity, out of their situation.
[time=3424] And I thank you, you will bring each one out victoriously, and we give you the praise and glory for it in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3433] I wanna just give you some parting words.
[time=3436] You received me so well, and I just thank you for the privilege of ministering to you.
[time=3440] I wanna just leave you with this one statement.
[time=3443] When life throws you a setback, don't take a step back, make a comeback.
[time=3452] God bless you, have a wonderful week.
