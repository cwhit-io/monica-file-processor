[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=35] We're thankful as always that you've tuned in and I wanna take a few minutes this morning and talk to you about a resource that we have available to you.
[time=43] It's a resource that we've talked about actually often in the last several months but I wanna just keep talking about it because we keep hearing about it.
[time=52] We keep hearing stories of how God's using this resource to encourage so many of you in our viewing audience and so many who are a part of the Blackhawk family.
[time=61] It's actually two resources.
[time=63] Let me just start with the first one.
[time=65] It's called our Digging Deeper resource.
[time=68] You can find the Digging Deeper material on our website, on our homepage.
[time=72] If you just go down and click on the Digging Deeper icon, what you'll find is this.
[time=77] You'll find a really well done, a really well put together study, discussion, an interactive opportunity for you to with this material continue the discussion from Sunday mornings.
[time=92] So many times we finish on Sunday having spent 35, 40 minutes on the message but there's so much more to talk about.
[time=99] There's so much more that you could learn.
[time=101] There's so many things that you could not only know and learn but that you could apply and this is a great tool to help you do that.
[time=108] I wanna invite you to go to the Digging Deeper icon and even print it out.
[time=112] You could use it for your own personal study.
[time=114] You could use it for your small group study.
[time=116] You could use it for the Sunday school class that you teach.
[time=119] I mean, you could really use this material in a number of different settings and I'm so grateful for our Digging Deeper team and the work they do each week.
[time=129] It is a great chance for you as the week goes by to keep your mind and your heart fixed, to keep yourself focused on the great truth that we were able to talk about and uncover on Sunday mornings.
[time=142] Hey, on the same website, on that same homepage, you're gonna find another icon that's entitled Dig Kids.
[time=149] That's right, Dig Kids and moms and dads.
[time=152] This is a great chance for you to kind of take that same concept and this is material geared toward young people.
[time=159] This is a chance for you with your daughter or for you with your son or for you with your whole family at night two, three times a week to really just continue the biblical discussion to invest and deposit into their young hearts and lives, the great truth of God's word.
[time=175] I'm so thankful for Janice Mariezy and the children's ministry team that works so hard to put this material together and I hope you'll utilize it.
[time=184] I hope you'll be encouraged by it.
[time=186] Two great resources that will continue to help you grow, not only in your understanding of God's word, but the application of it in your everyday life.
[time=196] Hey, I hope you're blessed by it.
[time=197] I know we have been.
[time=198] Thank you so much for tuning in today.
[time=200] God bless you and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=204] Priests were overwhelmed and then your glory came.
[time=206] But as difficult as it is to ask, I'm still gonna ask it.
[time=212] Lord, let your glory fall because that's where I know I'm supposed to be in Him with Him all the time.
[time=220] Will you sing that with me?
[time=221] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=229] Man, lift your voices.
[time=231] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=238] Sounds beautiful, church.
[time=240] [MUSIC - 205 seconds]
[time=459] [APPLAUSE]
[time=466] [MUSIC - 486 seconds]
[time=957] Well, last time.
[time=959] [MUSIC]
[time=964] Open your Bibles, if you would, to the book of Genesis.
[time=969] Will you do that?
[time=970] The book of Genesis, which is where we've been, my friends, over these last seven, eight weeks or so.
[time=976] Seven timeless stories from the book of Genesis.
[time=979] Is God still at work in anxious times as you look back over the course of the last seven weeks?
[time=986] How would you as a family answer that question?
[time=989] Is God still at work in anxious times?
[time=991] Yes or no?
[time=992] Yes, amen, amen.
[time=994] He absolutely is.
[time=995] This morning, I wanna just if we could take a few minutes and look back, kinda look back at where we've been in this study and try to glean some things, to be reminded of some things that we've seen.
[time=1006] And I wanna show you some things we didn't get to look at.
[time=1009] And I think in the process, I hope in the process, you and I'll be very, very encouraged.
[time=1014] Over the course of the past seven weeks, as we've studied and looked closely at these seven timeless stories from the book of Genesis, Adam and Eve, Noah and his family in the flood, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph through it all.
[time=1030] We've been reminded again and again of some very important truth.
[time=1033] Truth about, watch this, the truth about our God.
[time=1036] We've been reminded of the truth about us.
[time=1042] We've seen the truth about our God's ways, the ways in which he functions, the ways in which he works.
[time=1048] And we've seen the truth about our God's plan.
[time=1052] And in our remaining minutes this morning, I wanna do our very best to just kinda quickly invite each of you in the room and those of you watching on the broadcast to look back with me through this great book at some truth that we touched on and some that we skipped.
[time=1066] And I hope at the end of the morning, your heart and mind will be filled with a picture of our God that your heart and your mind this morning will be filled with a picture of our God and his plan that will encourage and inspire you to be the one thing God from the very beginning has always wanted a people for his own possession.
[time=1088] Number one, let's just jump in.
[time=1089] The truth, what did we see?
[time=1091] What have we learned regarding the truth about our God?
[time=1095] The truth about our God.
[time=1096] With just a thoughtful read through the book of Genesis, one can clearly surmise some very specific traits of our God.
[time=1105] He is incomparable.
[time=1107] He is a jealous God.
[time=1109] He is a wise God.
[time=1110] He is strong.
[time=1111] He is compassionate.
[time=1112] He is full of justice.
[time=1114] He is full of mercy on and on and on.
[time=1117] The list can go on and on.
[time=1120] Our conversation could go, but let's just take a few minutes this morning and look at two, two very significant attributes of God that stand out for us, I believe in the text of the book of Genesis.
[time=1133] The first one comes from the creation passage.
[time=1136] Would you turn in your Bibles to Genesis chapter one?
[time=1140] We didn't spend a lot of time here early on in our study, but today we come back to this, to see this first attribute.
[time=1147] The truth about our God.
[time=1151] First thing I want you to see here is that he did more than make.
[time=1156] That's right.
[time=1157] Our God, my friends, as we look at this text, we come to the realization that he did a lot more than just make our God created.
[time=1166] He created.
[time=1167] The God of the Bible, my friends, is a creator.
[time=1172] Genesis one, one.
[time=1174] In the beginning, God what?
[time=1176] Say it.
[time=1178] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=1182] The Hebrew word used for created speaks to the absence.
[time=1185] Watch this, it speaks to the absence of any pre-existent material.
[time=1190] The word created.
[time=1195] And our God, my friends, is a creator.
[time=1198] And the word itself speaks to the absence, I'll say it this way, of any pre-existing ingredient.
[time=1205] See, we make cookies.
[time=1209] We use flour and eggs and sugar and oil.
[time=1213] That's called making.
[time=1214] God isn't in the business of making.
[time=1216] No, what we learn about God in Genesis is that he's in the business of what?
[time=1220] Say it.
[time=1221] Creating.
[time=1221] Our God is a creator.
[time=1223] Genesis one, three, it's powerful.
[time=1225] Just to read through the entire creation account, Genesis one, three says it so clearly and so powerfully.
[time=1232] Then God said, he just said it, let there be light, and there was what?
[time=1237] He speaks it.
[time=1239] He speaks it with his creative power into existence, where there was darkness.
[time=1246] Now there was because of his creation.
[time=1249] Now there was light.
[time=1250] So you might be sitting there this morning.
[time=1252] I think there were several first hour thinking this.
[time=1255] It's okay, it's a good question.
[time=1256] You might be asking, so why, Kelly, is it so important that you would talk to us about this kind of obvious thing about our God?
[time=1265] Why all the effort to help us see that God creates?
[time=1269] Why all the time spent already?
[time=1271] To show us that he creates new, good things out of nothing.
[time=1276] I'll say that to you one more time.
[time=1282] That he creates new, good things out of nothing.
[time=1287] Well, I'll tell you what, I'm really thankful
[time=1294] over these 21 years of ministry that I've known that about him
[time=1301] because I can't tell you how helpful it's been to be able to articulate this and to talk about this when people have come to me as they have over the years and said, you know what, God can't redeem me.
[time=1313] God, yeah, I could never be transformed or saved.
[time=1320] Me, they say, me, made new.
[time=1324] No, no, no, they say, Kelly, you don't understand.
[time=1327] I've been too immoral.
[time=1331] I've been too evil.
[time=1333] I've been too sinful.
[time=1336] There's nothing there, they say, as they speak about themselves and the condition of their heart.
[time=1343] They say, there's nothing there.
[time=1346] They say, my heart is empty and I say, because I know what I know to be true about my God, I say that's perfect because out of nothing he creates.
[time=1361] What is empty he makes full.
[time=1364] I think about King David and the horrific experience of his whole life getting completely sideways.
[time=1372] Just how deep he went in the sin and the despair of his life, how dark that was, how destructive that was, how desolate it was and David cries out in Psalm 51 10.
[time=1385] Make in me a clean heart, did he say, make?
[time=1391] What did he say?
[time=1392] Create, because he knew his God was a God who what?
[time=1397] Creates, out of nothing, out of emptiness, out of a barren wasteland, of rebellion and iniquity.
[time=1406] Our God creates, amen, amen.
[time=1411] He's a relational God, don't forget that.
[time=1413] Continuing on here, he is a, we learn this in our study of Genesis.
[time=1418] He is a relational God.
[time=1419] Let me show you, I don't know that we spent much time here.
[time=1421] Look at Genesis 2.18, Genesis 2.18, then the Lord God Himself said, it is not good.
[time=1427] God said, it is not good for the man to be what?
[time=1432] Alone, God said, it's not good for the man to be alone.
[time=1436] I will make him a helper suitable for him.
[time=1440] See, my friends, what we see here is really a glimpse into the mindset and heart of God.
[time=1445] What we get here is a glimpse into God's character and God's nature, he looks at this thing and it is not as he would have it because he's a relational God and he's never been about being alone.
[time=1457] And so he gives him a helper because in God's design, it's always gonna be about relationship.
[time=1465] Look at the next chapter, look at 3.8, we did look at this.
[time=1469] Let's just look at it quickly again, 3.8.
[time=1472] My goodness, sin has, sin has entered into the scene.
[time=1478] The destruction and the ripple of sin's effect is already starting to be felt.
[time=1484] And in verse eight, it's a very interesting verse.
[time=1487] It says, and we've looked at this before over the years.
[time=1490] So for some of you, it may be review.
[time=1492] It says they, Adam and Eve, they heard, look at that.
[time=1495] They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden.
[time=1500] Stop right there.
[time=1503] Remember this?
[time=1504] What does that tell you about the nature of Adam and Eve's relationship with God prior to the fall?
[time=1514] They, did they see him coming in the garden?
[time=1519] No, they heard the sound.
[time=1521] So it infers, they were familiar with the what?
[time=1525] They knew the sound because they had experienced it before.
[time=1530] They had walked with him before.
[time=1532] They had been in the pattern of that.
[time=1534] So they, they knew they had been with him so intimately and so often that they knew the sound of him coming in the garden in the cool of the day.
[time=1545] Because that's the way God is.
[time=1548] He's relational.
[time=1550] Don't forget this.
[time=1551] In eternity, in eternity past, hard concept to grasp.
[time=1556] I know.
[time=1557] But way, way back in the beginning, before the beginning, 'cause there wasn't any beginning, but in the eternity past, way back, you know, where it never began.
[time=1565] How did I do in clearing that up for you?
[time=1569] (congregation laughing) Eternity past, we know that God existed.
[time=1574] And we know that God existed in relationship with God the Son and God the who.
[time=1581] God the Holy Spirit.
[time=1582] We know that forever God has always existed
[time=1588] in this triune, trinity, small group.
[time=1593] There they've been.
[time=1596] Forever they've been together.
[time=1597] Forever they've been intimate.
[time=1599] Forever they've been connected.
[time=1604] And now with the onset of creation, he makes man in his image, he makes man.
[time=1613] Why does he make man?
[time=1615] Some say to control and manipulate mankind while oppressively ruling earth from his heavenly throne.
[time=1623] No.
[time=1624] No, no, why does God create man to take walks with him in the garden, in the cool of the day?
[time=1631] Wow.
[time=1636] He's just from the beginning wanted to be with, just wanted to be with you, just wants to be in relationship with you.
[time=1646] It's why religion has never been the answer.
[time=1651] It's why from the beginning in God's design, religion was never the answer.
[time=1657] You never got to God.
[time=1658] You will not get to God today and you will not get to him in the future by religion.
[time=1665] The only way you get to God is through relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1674] His only begotten son.
[time=1675] He's a relational God.
[time=1680] Lots more to say about him.
[time=1681] Let's jump quickly to us, the truth about us.
[time=1684] Two things real quick, we're broken and we're leaners.
[time=1688] Let me start with we're broken.
[time=1689] You know what friends, a study of the book of Genesis, even the brief one we've just done clearly indicates to us again and again and again almost on every page that we mankind post Genesis three, we are absolutely broken.
[time=1708] We are broken.
[time=1709] We just aren't even close to what God intended.
[time=1714] Sin just ruined us.
[time=1719] And you know what?
[time=1719] When you really start looking at where we've been and you start going back through the book, you realize I saw it again this week, you realize something, you realize how quickly we got broken, you realize how quickly and we got ruined, you realize how quickly sin moved in its pervasive nature into all of mankind.
[time=1743] It's really amazing when you look back at it.
[time=1744] Go to Genesis four.
[time=1747] Real quick, go to Genesis four, verse three.
[time=1750] It says there, so it came about in the course of time that this is just a chapter, this is just half a chapter after the fall.
[time=1760] Then we're talking about the sons of Adam and Eve.
[time=1764] We're talking about movement from biting into some fruit,
[time=1770] which I know is utter rebellion to this.
[time=1774] So it came about in the course of time that came brought an offering to the Lord of the fruit of the ground, able on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock, ones into produce, ones into meat and of their fat portions.
[time=1789] And the Lord, we don't know why, it doesn't say, but the Lord had regard for Abel and for his offering, but for Cain and for his offering, he had no regard.
[time=1798] So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell.
[time=1802] Then the Lord said to Cain, why are you angry?
[time=1806] And why has your countenance fallen?
[time=1808] If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up?
[time=1812] And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door and its desire is for you, but you must master it.
[time=1822] Wow, there's a lot there.
[time=1824] I'd love to get into, but we won't, let's keep going.
[time=1829] Verse eight, here it is, Cain told Abel, his brother, and it came about when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him, murdered him.
[time=1844] Right there in the field, it's the first sign of this we see in any way, shape or form, sin is permeating.
[time=1853] And now a half a chapter later, we're murdering people in cold blood.
[time=1859] And then when you stop and think about it some more, which I've done in recent weeks, you realize that two chapters later, it's so bad and so pervasive, God says, forget it, I'm done.
[time=1873] And he destroys the earth because of what?
[time=1877] Because of sin, so bad, so rampant, so dark.
[time=1881] He destroys it all and starts over.
[time=1889] We're all, we are, we are all busted up and all through Genesis.
[time=1895] We see it again and again and again.
[time=1898] One of the ways in which we see we're broken, and you see it there on the screen, we're leaners.
[time=1903] We've talked about this leaning, the sin of leaning.
[time=1908] It can be a sin depending upon which way you lean, right?
[time=1912] We've talked about that in recent weeks.
[time=1914] Let me show you an example of this one that we didn't look at on the first pass through, go to Genesis nine.
[time=1920] We see this again and again and again in the book of Genesis, we see it again and again and again with the people of Israel.
[time=1927] But let me just give you another example of this leaning, this leaning on our own understanding, this leaning on our own agenda, this leaning that took place.
[time=1936] In the hearts and lives of the people of God, nine one.
[time=1941] Maybe you've seen this, maybe you haven't, it's very interesting.
[time=1944] And God bless Noah and his sons.
[time=1946] And God said to Noah and his sons, be fruitful and multiply, and what, fill the earth.
[time=1954] Now the word there fill implies and you'll see it later in the text, scatter, go.
[time=1960] You go there, you go there, you go there, you go there.
[time=1964] Multiply, be fruitful, multiply, and God's word to those people was clear, go and fill the earth.
[time=1973] Okay, fast forward to 11 one.
[time=1977] Now the whole earth, here we go, they're on their way.
[time=1980] Gonna obey God, they're on their way.
[time=1982] The whole earth used the same language and the same words.
[time=1985] It came about as they journeyed east, but they found a plane in the land of Shinaar and what?
[time=1992] Uh-oh, uh-oh, I think you said, I think you said scatter and here they are settling.
[time=2001] They said to each other, come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly.
[time=2007] And they use brick for stone and they use tar for mortar.
[time=2009] They said, come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower, remember this story from Sunday school?
[time=2015] And a tower whose top will reach into heaven and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be what?
[time=2023] Say it, now they're just, see now they're just, they're gone.
[time=2027] They were okay, we'll do this now.
[time=2029] They're just saying, now they're to the point where they're saying they're gonna do the very thing they got told, they're gonna do the very thing they got told not to do.
[time=2036] Now it's just willful, five, six lines here.
[time=2041] Otherwise we'll be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.
[time=2046] No kidding, the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.
[time=2052] The Lord said, behold, they are one people and they all have the same language and this is what they began to do and now nothing which they purposed to do will be impossible for them.
[time=2061] Come, let us go down there and confuse their language so that they will not understand one another's speech.
[time=2069] So the Lord verse eight scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth and they stopped building the city therefore its name was called what, Babel?
[time=2081] Because they're the Lord confused, the language of the whole earth and from there the Lord scattered.
[time=2088] They wanted to settle, God wanted to scatter.
[time=2092] They disobeyed and settled, God comes in and scatters.
[time=2096] It's the one tragic tendency that would mark the people of Israel to the end of the Old Testament.
[time=2105] They wanted judges and they wanted kings and they didn't listen to the prophets and they just again and again and again.
[time=2115] God gives them this and calls them there and they say no, we think we'll go here.
[time=2120] Leaning, we've looked at Proverbs three, five and six in recent weeks, trust in the Lord with all your heart and don't lean on you.
[time=2131] Don't lean into your wisdom.
[time=2133] Don't lean into your agenda.
[time=2135] Lean not on your own understanding and in all your ways acknowledge him.
[time=2140] Lean on him.
[time=2142] Lean into his truth.
[time=2143] Lean into what he has said.
[time=2146] Go where he said to go and do what he said to do.
[time=2149] And he will make your paths straight, right, blessed, healthy.
[time=2156] Might even be difficult.
[time=2162] It might even be filled with trial but it's his path and he'll make it straight when you lean on him.
[time=2169] He'll teach you something in the midst of that.
[time=2170] He'll show you himself in the middle of that.
[time=2176] Are you a leaner?
[time=2177] I thought about it this week.
[time=2179] Here's a few things just to think about.
[time=2181] Are you a leaner?
[time=2182] Leiners are oftentimes the loners.
[time=2189] They don't like being with others.
[time=2190] They kind of want to do their own thing.
[time=2191] They kind of got it figured out.
[time=2193] They don't like playing by the rules.
[time=2195] They're autonomous.
[time=2198] They're kind of above everybody else 'cause they just, they've got it figured out.
[time=2204] They don't like playing with others.
[time=2206] They just like kind of playing by themselves.
[time=2208] Loners are oftentimes leaners and to lean on one's own understanding is not good.
[time=2215] Leiners are oftentimes self-sufficient.
[time=2218] They're oftentimes distrusting.
[time=2220] They're oftentimes warriors.
[time=2222] I know a lot of warriors, they worry so much.
[time=2225] They worry so aggressively that in their worrying, then they concoct plans and devise schemes and they manipulate and they construct their world in just a certain way 'cause they're so worried and in their worry they lean on them and not him.
[time=2242] Loners, self-sufficient, distrusting warriors, leaners are oftentimes impatient people, willful people, independent.
[time=2253] Truth about us, we're broken and we're leaners.
[time=2257] Just two discouraging realities we see in us
[time=2264] as humans through the book of Genesis and through the rest of Scripture.
[time=2267] Here's the good news, my friends.
[time=2268] The truth about God's ways.
[time=2270] He's long-suffering and patient.
[time=2275] Lots to say there, but I'm gonna move on.
[time=2277] He's long-suffering and patient with our brokenness and our leaning.
[time=2282] I'll just say it that way.
[time=2283] And then let me show you this.
[time=2285] This truth about our God that we saw, where was it?
[time=2289] It was back in chapter three.
[time=2291] I want you to see this.
[time=2293] My friends, our God has always.
[time=2295] He has be encouraged this morning.
[time=2297] He has always been about redemption.
[time=2302] Our God from the very beginning of time has always been about taking that which is broken, taking that which is busted.
[time=2311] He's always been about taking that which is enslaved.
[time=2314] He's always taken about that which is separated and distant and bringing it back and restoring and renewing.
[time=2323] Our God has always been about redemption.
[time=2326] We read this at the conclusion of, I think it was week two.
[time=2331] I'm gonna read it to you again.
[time=2332] This was just so powerful for me that day.
[time=2335] And if you were here, be encouraged by it.
[time=2338] Again, if you weren't, maybe it'll be a new insight for you into the redemptive, rescuing heart of God.
[time=2345] Genesis 3.22.
[time=2348] Remember this?
[time=2350] The fall has transpired.
[time=2354] The curse.
[time=2355] The curses have been delivered.
[time=2357] As things coming to an awful end, Adam and Eve are just broken and now filled with sin.
[time=2364] The original design now tainted by iniquity.
[time=2368] Then the Lord God said, 22.
[time=2371] See, I read this as a kid and I always thought as a kid.
[time=2374] And I think I thought for most of my adult life that when I got to 22, what these next few verses were about was that they messed up and now they were getting the boot.
[time=2383] And I always felt like they deserved to get the boot 'cause they messed up, right?
[time=2389] Raise your hand if that makes sense.
[time=2390] My whole life I thought, okay, this is what's going on here.
[time=2393] Okay, this is the justice of God.
[time=2396] And I think it is.
[time=2397] And they're getting tossed out of the garden like a kid who is disobedient in a class.
[time=2404] And then you read this and you go, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[time=2407] Look at this.
[time=2407] When the Lord God said, behold, the man has become like one of us.
[time=2413] I don't know who he's talking to.
[time=2416] (laughs) I think maybe, I don't know.
[time=2418] Maybe it's the Trinity, I'm not sure.
[time=2422] He says, behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil 'cause they ate from the tree of the knowledge of, right?
[time=2432] All right, knowing good and evil.
[time=2434] Now, look at this.
[time=2435] Now you might stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life.
[time=2440] And if he takes from the tree of life and eats it, he will live forever in his unredeemed state.
[time=2448] Wow.
[time=2450] So the heart of God, this redemptive heart of God is not gonna let that happen.
[time=2454] So therefore God sent him out from the Garden of Eden.
[time=2458] So they wouldn't eat of the tree of life, eat and live forever in an unredeemed state.
[time=2462] We drove the man out at the east end of the garden.
[time=2467] You stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword, which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.
[time=2474] Abraham, Isaac, and the ram that comes last minute into the thicket.
[time=2478] God has always been a God of redemption.
[time=2481] Noah and his family.
[time=2484] God, a God of redemption.
[time=2486] Jud, Joseph and the pit and Pharaoh and the rise to prominence.
[time=2492] In this case, God again, this God of redemption.
[time=2495] And Joseph's brothers who threw him in the pit, come back and need.
[time=2499] God's always been this God of redemption.
[time=2503] Restoring and reconciling that, which was broken.
[time=2506] The truth about God's ways.
[time=2512] So important that you hear this, my friends.
[time=2515] So important that we as a family hear these words.
[time=2518] The truth about God's plan.
[time=2520] What did we see?
[time=2521] What did we learn?
[time=2524] What we saw and learned is this.
[time=2526] From the very beginning, which is what the word Genesis means.
[time=2531] God's redemptive plan.
[time=2534] Redemptive, saving, restoring, reconciling.
[time=2539] God's redemptive plan was to be carried out from the very beginning, passed along by God or by a people.
[time=2547] I mean, yes, God's initiating it,
[time=2553] but the agent, the tool, the mechanism that God and His sovereignty from the beginning of time has chosen to use has always been a people.
[time=2562] A people who would, with great faithfulness and passion,
[time=2568] reflect to an on-looking world.
[time=2570] The Philistines and your neighbors.
[time=2579] It's always been His plan that a people with great faithfulness and passion would reflect to an on-looking world, the love, the compassion, the justice and grace of their God.
[time=2591] 26, go there quickly.
[time=2593] 26, Genesis 26, verses two to five.
[time=2599] It says this, Genesis 26, two to five.
[time=2607] Lord appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt." Talking to Isaac.
[time=2611] Stay in the land of which I shall tell you.
[time=2613] So journey in this land and I will be with you and bless you, Isaac, for to you and to your descendants.
[time=2620] I will give all these lands and I will establish the oath, which I swore to your father Abraham.
[time=2626] I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and will give your descendants all these lands.
[time=2633] And here it is, and by your descendants, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed because Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes and my laws.
[time=2648] 28, 10.
[time=2649] Then Jacob departed from Virshiba, went toward Harani, came to a certain place and spent the night there.
[time=2655] Because of the sun had set, he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and laid down in that place.
[time=2660] He had a dream and behold, a ladder was set on the earth where it's top reaching the heaven and behold the angels of God were ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said, I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac, the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your descendants.
[time=2685] Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth.
[time=2688] Now it's not the stars of the heavens.
[time=2690] Now it's the dust of the earth and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south and in you, here it is, and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
[time=2706] Behold, I am with you.
[time=2708] And they didn't do it.
[time=2713] They didn't do it, they didn't obey them.
[time=2720] They weren't faithful.
[time=2724] They leaned the wrong way.
[time=2726] And due to the unfaithfulness and continued rebellion
[time=2732] of Israel, God chooses to birth a new redemptive plan.
[time=2737] A new people who will now listen, who will now be responsible, this new people.
[time=2747] They will now be responsible for proclaiming, passing along and living out God's message of grace and salvation.
[time=2756] A new people who will be his and he will be theirs and they will walk closely with him.
[time=2763] And now the nations will be blessed by them, this new people.
[time=2769] Now the nations will be loved by them.
[time=2773] Now the nations will be reached for the kingdom's sake by them.
[time=2781] And this morning I just want you to make sure, want to make sure that every one of us in the room realizes that if you know the Lord this morning personally, you are them.
[time=2796] The great preacher E.V. Hill was his name, E.V. Hill.
[time=2807] E.V. Hill stood in chapel one day at the Masters College back in 1986.
[time=2816] And I'll never forget just a huge African-American man with a big voice.
[time=2821] And he stood there on the front of that stage and wagged his finger in our faces.
[time=2827] And with great power and authority, just said it again and again and again, use it.
[time=2832] You want to know the answer?
[time=2837] You want to know where the hope is?
[time=2838] He wasn't in any way taking away the providence or the divine power and the initiation of salvation by God, but in terms of mechanisms, in terms of instruments, he just stood there and pointed at a gym full of 1,000 college kids and said, use, use it.
[time=2852] And I want to tell you this morning, you're it.
[time=2856] How's that?
[time=2858] Your God's, the church is God's redemptive plan.
[time=2865] And as Marty and Joy and Doug and Chris come, I want you just to think with me, you're it.
[time=2871] This is God's plan.
[time=2874] And if you and I are the sum total today of God's redemptive plan, if we're the ones who are to bless the nations, we're the ones who are to love the nations, we're the ones who are to reach the nations.
[time=2889] You're cubical, you're neighborhood babies in Kenya.
[time=2895] Then there are some questions, I think, that have to be asked.
[time=2898] Are you being, are you?
[time=2901] See, this is where sometimes we go to we.
[time=2904] And I think sometimes we kind of cop out there.
[time=2908] So I'm not going to go to we.
[time=2910] I'm going to stay with you.
[time=2912] Are you, you, are you being God's redemptive person?
[time=2917] Are you?
[time=2923] I don't look around too much.
[time=2924] I'm talking to you.
[time=2926] Are you, who are you reaching?
[time=2929] Who, who is God using?
[time=2933] How is God using you to reach those in your world?
[time=2938] Are you being the church?
[time=2939] You are in your world, the God of this universe's
[time=2945] redemptive plan.
[time=2947] And listen, you can, you can, you can be developing redemptive friendships with those far from him.
[time=2954] You can.
[time=2955] You can be redemptively serving those in need.
[time=2961] You can, you can on your block.
[time=2963] You can with your small group.
[time=2964] You can with your Sunday morning community.
[time=2966] You can serve those in need.
[time=2970] Redemptively, you can, redemptively pray for those far from God in your world.
[time=2975] You can invite them to coffee.
[time=2979] You can invite them to a ball game.
[time=2981] You can invite them into your small group.
[time=2983] You can invite them to join us in a gathering on Sunday morning.
[time=2987] You are the church.
[time=2990] And the church is God's plan.
[time=2994] God's people to reach and redeem the nations.
[time=2997] Close your eyes, would you bow your heads?
[time=3000] Father God, as we end this morning with a song.
[time=3005] Oh God, I pray that we would be mindful of your faithfulness and your steadfastness.
[time=3012] So God, that we would be reminded of the God that we've seen in this study.
[time=3016] And because of that faithfulness, oh God, would you instill in us today in fresh or new ways?
[time=3023] God, a faithfulness of our own.
[time=3027] That would allow us to be a people for your own possession.
[time=3030] God, a people who would represent you.
[time=3032] Oh God, as we lift up and are reminded of your faithfulness, may our hearts be encouraged and may our bodies and our minds be strengthened to be all that you've called us to be.
[time=3046] [MUSIC - 241 seconds]
[time=3297] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 56 seconds]
[time=3380] [AMEN - 1 seconds] (audience applauds) I'm gonna ask these guys to kinda sing us out of the room this morning with that song, but before we do that, let me just invite you to stand quietly where you are.
[time=3399] And with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, I do wanna say this, if there's anybody in the room today, or anybody watching, you know, you can contact us.
[time=3409] If there's anybody in the room today, and when we talk about how God's word reveals our brokenness, our sinfulness, how busted up we are, and our tendency to lean the wrong way, if you wanna get that healed, if you want that brokenness fixed, if you wanna know the Lord Jesus Christ, as your Lord and your Savior and friend, you come and let us talk with you this morning, meet me right down here, and we'll pray with you and talk that through.
[time=3441] The rest of you, I wanna just encourage you to be faithful.
[time=3444] He has been so faithful to reach you, and so will you be.
[time=3452] I know it's we, but will you be faithful to reach those that God's given you the opportunity to reach, to reach out to, to encourage, to befriend, to come alongside and serve.
[time=3465] Oh God, give us the strength of heart and the courage, courage to do that very thing, to be faithful like you, and to extend to others the same grace and love God that you've extended to us.
[time=3478] Well, thank you for it, and all the people in the room agreed and said, amen.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
