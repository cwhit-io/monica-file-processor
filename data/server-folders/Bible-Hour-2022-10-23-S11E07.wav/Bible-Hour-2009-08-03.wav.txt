[time=290] [APPLAUSE]
[time=295] Father, in heaven, we just want to worship you this morning.
[time=299] In light of all of who you are, we just want to praise and lift you high for being those things that we mentioned and even more.
[time=307] God, we agree with the psalmist when we say that your greatness, no one can even fathom.
[time=312] And that all that we know of who you are is just a small glimpse.
[time=315] And God, if we were to behold you in all of your beauty and all of your glory, God, we would be brought to our knees.
[time=324] We would be brought to our faces planted in the ground.
[time=327] And like your word, chose us.
[time=329] God, fire consumes you.
[time=331] And you are awesome.
[time=333] And you are terrible in a good way.
[time=337] All of that, God makes us really thankful for Jesus.
[time=339] It makes us really thankful for His sacrifice that covers us with grace and mercy and brings us near to you.
[time=347] We pray this morning that everything we do in this hour would be pleasing and that we would use all of it to worship you.
[time=355] God, that you would engage our hearts in this process.
[time=359] For your glory and in the name of your Son, we pray these things.
[time=363] [AMEN] Well, welcome again.
[time=365] I'm Bill Hartman.
[time=366] I'm lead administrator here for Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=368] Just beginning my second year and Amy's mention of the fall reminded me that our school begins full day August 20th.
[time=376] If you're out here and have not yet enrolled your youngster and wished you could, give us a call tomorrow.
[time=383] When Pastor Kelly asked me if I would do this today, I thought from just a second he was going to ask me to preach.
[time=390] If I could preach it, he quickly corrected that and said, "I'm just here to introduce Reverend Terry." He reminded me quickly that preachers don't like long introductions.
[time=399] They like long periods of time to preach, so I can't say very much here.
[time=403] But if I did get to teach a little, I'd probably tie it around a verse that this summer has meant quite a bit more to me.
[time=410] Mark 838 and kind of a quick paraphrase would be when Jesus is saying, "If you are ashamed of me in this world, if you are ashamed of me and my word,
[time=421] in this world, I will be ashamed of you when I return with my Heavenly Father
[time=427] and with the Holy Angels." I think we could talk all morning about that.
[time=433] But when I think about that verse, and then I think about Reverend Terry, who's going to share with us.
[time=438] I've had the privilege of working alongside of Reverend Terry for the last three years on the East Island County School Board.
[time=444] He's been the president for the last two years.
[time=446] He was on our board for four years beyond that.
[time=450] I've really come to know that if there's one thing he's not ashamed of, it is his Lord.
[time=456] I've had to remind him at times on the board, wait a second, this is a board meeting, this isn't your congregation.
[time=462] But speaking of that, he is also the pastor of New Life, Church of God,
[time=468] and we've rearranged this morning just a little bit because he's going to be back there by noon to preach there yet.
[time=474] But I really would like you to welcome him this morning.
[time=478] And Reverend Terry, if you'd come up, I'd like to pray for you just before you begin.
[time=482] [APPLAUSE]
[time=488] Heavenly Father, we collectively, I personally thank you for your time.
[time=491] I personally thank you for Reverend Terry.
[time=494] I thank you for what he's meant to me.
[time=496] I thank you for what he's meant to really to the East Island County Schools and to the prayer that he brings to the table with the issues that are out there ahead.
[time=504] I thank you for the word that he'll share this morning.
[time=507] I thank you especially for your word that he will mold with the thoughts that he has to touch our hearts.
[time=513] We ask Father for your presence in your son Jesus' name.
[time=516] [AMEN - 1 seconds] Reverend Terry, I always like to check the rules if someone gets excited and agrees with something you say, are they welcome to respond?
[time=525] Absolutely, and we're going to practice this morning.
[time=528] [AMEN] Hallelujah.
[time=531] God is good at ending.
[time=533] And all the time, our God is good.
[time=539] Again, I have one more celebration to teach on this morning, and so we're going to beat the devil with a short stick this morning.
[time=547] [AMEN] Hallelujah.
[time=549] Got to get your word in your hand, Bill.
[time=551] Thank you so much for that introduction.
[time=553] Again, a man of God.
[time=555] I'm so glad to serve with him with East Island and just to know that you have a brother in Christ
[time=562] with you in the marketplace or wherever you may be.
[time=566] And over the past few weeks, I know Pastor Kelly, the angel of this house, and I'm so glad to be here with you on this morning.
[time=575] It's a joy, it's a privilege, and I wouldn't miss it for the world.
[time=579] In fact, we made it in record time from Maryland yesterday to get back here to be with you today.
[time=587] So I'm excited to be with you today.
[time=589] But as Pastor has been teaching on the seven timeless stories from the book of Genesis, I was on a similar theme.
[time=596] The theme that I've been teaching on is rejoicing in times of trouble.
[time=600] And so I want to talk about that.
[time=603] But today, I want to deal with it from the standpoint.
[time=605] We know that God is still at work in anxious times.
[time=609] But the question is, is what do we do in difficult times?
[time=613] Are we still faithful when things don't quite go the way we want them to go,
[time=619] when the dreams that we have?
[time=621] What do we do?
[time=622] Do we continue to have faith in God?
[time=624] And so in a few moments, I want to share that with you.
[time=626] But if you would, because Pastor, let me know that I'd be the pastor for the day,
[time=632] then you're going to act like you're at New Life.
[time=634] Amen?
[time=635] [AMEN] Hallelujah.
[time=637] That's what I'm talking about.
[time=638] We'll get to practice just a little smidget more before the morning is out.
[time=643] But if you'd be so kind to turn with me to Genesis, chapter 41, and 41,
[time=651] I'm going to pick up at the end of the dream and share some thoughts in between there.
[time=659] There's a short scripture reading.
[time=661] Do you be so kind to stand with me here in this great church, this ministry that's been
[time=669] advancing the kingdom and this city of Fort Wayne?
[time=672] I'm excited about what you're bringing to this city.
[time=676] It's a joy to know what Black Hawk ministry means to this city.
[time=680] The enemy doesn't like it, but so what?
[time=683] I'm so glad of what you're doing in this city.
[time=687] Hold your finger there in Genesis, chapter 41 and verse 41.
[time=691] And I want you to make this declaration over your life.
[time=694] Hold your word in your hand and declare this over your life.
[time=697] This is the living word of God.
[time=703] I am what it says I am.
[time=707] I can do what it says I can do.
[time=711] This is the truth, the whole truth.
[time=716] And nothing but the truth.
[time=719] So help me, Holy Ghost.
[time=722] While you're still standing here this scripture reading out of the new international version,
[time=728] Genesis 41 and verse 41.
[time=731] Tessa Farrell said to Joseph, "I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt."
[time=737] And then Farrell took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger.
[time=742] He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
[time=747] He had him ride in chariots as second in command.
[time=751] The men shouted before him, "Make way." Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
[time=758] And then Farrell said to Joseph, "I am Farrell.
[time=762] But without your word, no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt."
[time=769] And Farrell gave Joseph the name Zafina Paniya and gave him a Sena daughter of Patifira,
[time=777] priest of on, to be his wife.
[time=780] And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.
[time=783] And Joseph was 30 years old when he entered the service of Farrell, king of Egypt.
[time=789] And Joseph went out from Farrell's presence and traveled throughout Egypt.
[time=794] And during the seven years of abundance, the land produced plentifully.
[time=798] And Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt
[time=804] and stored it in the cities.
[time=806] In each city, he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.
[time=811] Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain like the sand of the sea.
[time=816] It was so much that he stopped keeping record because it was beyond measure.
[time=823] Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph and a Sena daughter of Patifira, priest of on.
[time=830] And Joseph named his first born, Manasseh, and said it's because God has made me
[time=837] forget all my trouble and all my father's household.
[time=842] The second son, he named Ephraim, and said it's because God has made me fruitful
[time=850] in the land of my suffering.
[time=854] While you're still standing, I'm going to preach from that verse in this thing, faithfulness in difficult times.
[time=862] Father, your word is already anointed, but we prayed dear God this morning.
[time=866] You would anoint this frail vessel afresh.
[time=869] I know that I am nothing but your everything to me.
[time=875] Teach Holy Ghost, teach in the house today.
[time=879] And we'll be careful to give your name the honor, the glory, and the due praise.
[time=883] Fresh anointing for this hour, in Jesus' name we pray.
[time=887] All God's people said together, amen, and amen.
[time=892] You may be seated in the presence of the Lord.
[time=895] I had some backup at the early celebration, and usually when I'm praying you'll hear them talk right back to me as though they were part of the prayer and they are. And while I'm praying, I usually pray something like this because I recognize it's the power of the Holy Spirit. It has to be God who's declaring his word, his promises to us because he's the one who fulfills them.
[time=919] But I'll say something like this, and you're going to get ready to practice because they repeat what I say. Because I'll say I am nothing but your everything to me.
[time=931] And I'll say teach Holy Ghost, and they'll just say, when they hear me say teach, they just say teach, and I'll say teach in this place.
[time=939] Do you need practice, or when I say teach, you have to say teach like you mean it.
[time=946] Y'all ready? I'm going to see. I am nothing but your everything to me.
[time=951] Teach Holy Ghost. Teach in this place.
[time=955] Well, you did all right balcony people. I didn't hear you, but that's all right.
[time=959] Y'all still here with us today. We want him to teach on this morning.
[time=964] And so I've been teaching this very similar theme about rejoicing.
[time=969] You're a champion. And so this morning I greet you champion because God has a work
[time=975] for us to do, and we only do it through the strength that God provides.
[time=980] And so I want to share that a little bit this week because rejoicing in difficult times or rejoicing in times of trouble is not the absence of problems or rejoicing
[time=992] in difficult times. It doesn't mean that difficult times don't exist.
[time=996] It's simply rejoicing is access to God's strength in the midst of difficult times.
[time=1004] That while we're going through, we're acknowledging him in all of our ways because we couldn't make it in our own strength. And so I want to share this because even though we know that God is still working in anxious times or difficult times,
[time=1020] we know he's still working, you've gone through seven stories that really prove that.
[time=1024] But the question is what about us? What do we do in our difficult times?
[time=1029] Do we are we faithful? Do we still believe God? Will we still trust him even when we can't trace what he's doing? And we see that in Joseph's life. What a powerful
[time=1040] individual or story that shows the importance of what to do or how to be faithful in difficult times. One of my favorite authors, Charles Swindall,
[time=1051] he talks about attitude in life or attitude in adversity. And he explains
[time=1058] attitude is this. He says life is 10% of what happens to you. It's 90% of how you
[time=1067] react. I sort of paraphrase that for myself because I believe the same thing.
[time=1072] But life is 10% of what happens to you. It's 90% of what happens in you.
[time=1078] We can't always choose our challenges. We can't always choose our problems.
[time=1083] But we can always choose our attitudes. We can always choose how we react.
[time=1089] And this is what we see in Joseph's life. He had all type of circumstances and difficulties and hardships take place in his life. But the key was what did he react?
[time=1100] How did he react to the fact that he was serving a faithful God? In fact, it's almost mind boggling to think that when God gives you a picture or a glimpse
[time=1111] of where he's taking you to, he gives you a dream and you can see that God has
[time=1117] great plans for your life. What do you do when those dreams that God promised seemed to be shattered right before your eyes? Here's where Joseph had to make a
[time=1128] decision to be faithful in those difficult times. Let me share with you a life lesson in just a little bit about my own story, a little bit about myself and we'll make a couple of points and then I'll be headed over to new life to do it one more time.
[time=1143] Preach one more time. Here's the word. Life lesson is this.
[time=1146] How to remain faithful when dreams have been shattered?
[time=1152] How do you remain faithful, child of God, when your dreams have been shattered?
[time=1159] You know, I've had somewhat of a difficult times in this last year.
[time=1163] It's been kind of rough. It seemed like every four months or so.
[time=1167] I was losing someone who was precious to me.
[time=1170] My first was my auntie. We was away on vacation and actually one of the aunties
[time=1176] who was at that funeral on the way home, she happened to choke in a restaurant
[time=1183] and a few months after that she went on to be with the Lord as well.
[time=1187] While grieving through those process and while preaching her funeral there in Anderson, I got a call that my mom was sick and I didn't know.
[time=1198] For me, I've been away from my home in New York City for a long time.
[time=1202] I went to school in Boston, went to school in Oklahoma City, and spent most of my time as Administrator of Teaching School in Baltimore, Maryland, in the Columbia area, which we just came back from yesterday.
[time=1215] But I spent a lot of time away from my home.
[time=1218] And so it really impacted me to lose those two.
[time=1223] And then to hear the news about my mom that she was deathly ill.
[time=1227] And you're trying to figure out, Lord, what's going on?
[time=1230] I'm a praying man. I'm up every morning in prayer crying out to my father simply
[time=1236] because I know that our Heavenly Father watches over us.
[time=1239] I know that he understands what we're going through.
[time=1243] And so I'm making my business to cry out to him every day.
[time=1247] And so while I was praying and going back and forth, shortly after that, you know, I spent a week with my mom.
[time=1255] She went home to glory that week.
[time=1259] And so in succession, those difficult times begin to impact my life.
[time=1265] And God began to birth in me the importance of leaning on him and not my own understanding in my own difficult times.
[time=1275] All of us have difficult times. All of us have difficult situations.
[time=1280] But what do we do about those circumstances?
[time=1284] So I want to share at least three things that the Lord began to speak to me.
[time=1288] And I believe you can apply them to your own life.
[time=1290] Number one, we have to have faith in God.
[time=1295] Amen?
[time=1297] Sounds like something that we already know, a trite point, but it's so important.
[time=1301] I believe that it's a specific point because Joseph shows that everything that he went through, he had faith in the living God.
[time=1312] We have to hear it. In other words, you've got to hear what God promised.
[time=1318] Faith comes by hearing, any hearing, any hearing, not by having heard.
[time=1324] It's not that you've heard it already. You've got to hear it again.
[time=1328] If you want your faith to increase, you've got to get more word in you.
[time=1332] I love to hear music. I'm a musician. I play a little bit of music.
[time=1336] But after a while, I've got to turn off whether Christian broadcast or hearing music. And I've got to hear preaching.
[time=1342] I've got to hear teaching because your faith is built up in difficult times when we hear the word of God's.
[time=1350] I've got faith in God. Listen to what God has promised.
[time=1355] Joseph kept faith in difficult times because he relied on God and not on himself. What else do you do in a dungeon as he was?
[time=1364] He was in the dungeon. He was in a place. He was in a dark place.
[time=1368] And while there, he still kept his mind and his heart on the Lord.
[time=1374] When I begin to read the passage, if you go back and look in Genesis chapter 41 and verse 15 through verse 16.
[time=1383] Here's when Joseph is brought forth and he's about to interpret the dream of Ferrell.
[time=1388] And I love it because Ferrell, he was trying to get Joseph to take credit for being able to interpret dreams. It's amazing how, you know, our flesh tries to get us to take credit for what only God wants to take the glory for.
[time=1404] And so he says this, Ferrell says to this, he says I had a dream.
[time=1408] And no one can interpret it, but I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream, you can interpret it.
[time=1416] I'll use my vernacular. Joseph said, no, I can't, but God can.
[time=1421] See, we've got to understand that when God is doing things, we've got to learn how when people are trying to count on us or depend on us and say, wait a minute, no, I can't, but I know who can.
[time=1432] But my God can. And so he says, I cannot do it, Joseph replied, Ferrell, but God will give Ferrell the answer he desires.
[time=1443] It's learning that I've got to lean on God at all points for everything.
[time=1449] For faith comes by hearing, hearing by the word of God.
[time=1453] Let me give you this guiding principle for this point.
[time=1457] The guiding principle is, in order for us to be faithful in difficult times,
[time=1463] the source of our faith has to be on God's word and not our wisdom.
[time=1469] The source. And that's all Ferrell was trying to do.
[time=1473] He was trying to get Joseph to rely or to say, hey, look at what you've done.
[time=1478] It was a Sunday ago, a couple of weeks ago, I stood on the platform and I made an announcement to the congregation.
[time=1486] An announcement was this, while I was teaching, I resigned from being your pastor.
[time=1493] And I got the same blank stare that I'm getting right now.
[time=1497] And I said, no, here what I'm saying, the Holy Spirit is pastoring this church.
[time=1502] And God is tired of us always seeking man for the help that only God can give.
[time=1509] He's tired of us seeking fleshly resolution for the things that need a supernatural God.
[time=1516] I said, so you know what, for now, I don't want you always just trying to figure out what pastor, you know, you're waiting for me to pray, I'm waiting to get to church.
[time=1524] Listen, don't wait to get to church.
[time=1526] Lay hands on your own head and pray for your own self.
[time=1530] Amen, somebody.
[time=1532] David said, why so downcast, oh my soul, put your hope in God.
[time=1538] The Bible says David encouraged himself in the Lord.
[time=1541] That's what you see in Joseph's life as well.
[time=1544] We've got to learn how to rely on God.
[time=1547] Our faith has got to be in the Lord our God.
[time=1551] [AMEN] Number two, we've got to focus on God.
[time=1555] Not only do we have to hear it, but you have to see it.
[time=1558] Oh, I love this.
[time=1560] You have to see it as Joseph did in a dream before you see it in the natural.
[time=1567] You have to see it in the spirit before you can see it in the natural.
[time=1573] The Bible says, so we fix our eyes, not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.
[time=1578] Because what is seen is temporary, but what's unseen is eternal.
[time=1583] [AMEN] And so God's thing is, is we've got to learn how to see it before we see it.
[time=1589] You've got to get that in your heart.
[time=1591] I want to show that to you in just a minute.
[time=1593] But for faith is, now faith is being sure of what we hope for.
[time=1599] And certain of what we don't see.
[time=1602] Oh, I love it.
[time=1603] It's being sure of what we hope for.
[time=1605] In other words, when I say that you have to see it before you see it, just break down the
[time=1611] verse, faith is the substance of things hoped for.
[time=1615] If you're hoping for something, you have a glimpse of what it will be.
[time=1620] You might not have it tangibly, but you have something to hope for.
[time=1624] You have a glimpse.
[time=1625] You've got to see it before you actually see it tangibly.
[time=1630] And so here we see this in Joseph because he understood and simply, the word reminds
[time=1637] us is that we've got to look for God's promise while we're going through the process.
[time=1643] You have to go through the process.
[time=1646] We've got to look, we've got to look at God's promise while we're going through the process.
[time=1652] This is what Joseph did.
[time=1654] Joseph kept the faith in difficult times because he focused on the future.
[time=1660] He kept his faith.
[time=1661] He kept his eyes upon the Lord.
[time=1663] Jesus did it.
[time=1664] Our Lord did it in Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 2.
[time=1668] Word says, "So let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and the perfecter of our faith,
[time=1674] who for the joy set before him he endured the cross." Calling it shame sat down at the right hand of the Father.
[time=1681] Well, here's the deal.
[time=1683] Jesus set joy in the picture.
[time=1686] Jesus put joy.
[time=1688] While he was on the cross, he looked at what was better to handle what was bitter.
[time=1694] And so he's teaching us to do the same thing.
[time=1697] We ought to look unto Jesus because he's the author and he's the perfecter of our faith.
[time=1703] And him, for the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross.
[time=1707] The beautiful thing in keeping focus on God is that while Joseph was in the dungeon,
[time=1714] and while Pharaoh's dreams were being, he was going through all type of things.
[time=1719] He was trying to figure out how was he going to get an answer to the dream, this nightmare he was having.
[time=1725] And it's amazing that God was preparing Joseph through the process.
[time=1731] Isn't it amazing that while you're on the way to the promise or realizing the promise,
[time=1737] you've got to go through a process.
[time=1739] Everybody wants a finished product, but for some reason we just don't like the process.
[time=1746] God didn't forget about Joseph, even though he was in the dungeon.
[time=1750] In fact, God put Joseph on the king's mind.
[time=1754] He put Joseph on Pharaoh's mind.
[time=1757] How beautiful that God is still working behind the scenes no matter what we're going through.
[time=1765] And so number one, we have to have faith in God.
[time=1767] We have to hear it.
[time=1768] You've got to keep hearing what God has said.
[time=1771] Listen to what God has promised.
[time=1774] Number two, we've got to focus on God.
[time=1776] You've got to see it.
[time=1777] Before you tangibly see it, you've got to see it in your mind before you have it in your hands.
[time=1784] Look at what God's promised while going through the process.
[time=1788] But this last point, it's the favor of God.
[time=1793] As we focus on God, there's the favor of God.
[time=1796] We have to say it.
[time=1798] You have to begin to say it.
[time=1800] Listen, even when we're saved, the Bible says, so what does the word say?
[time=1805] It says the word is near you, it is in your mouth and in your heart.
[time=1809] That if we confess with our mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in our heart that
[time=1816] God's raising from the dead, then we're saved.
[time=1819] Watch this.
[time=1820] That is the principle of faith.
[time=1822] Faith comes by hearing, but it is released by speaking.
[time=1828] Amen, somebody?
[time=1830] Oh my.
[time=1831] See, the thing is, is that our faith, there is a faith increase when we hear the word, but
[time=1837] there's a faith release when we say the word.
[time=1840] If God said it, then I need to say it.
[time=1842] I've got to keep on saying what God said.
[time=1845] See, a lot of times, in difficult times, you'll have all kinds of problems, issues around you, and there's a temptation to begin to talk about all your woes and talk about all your problems and talk about what didn't happen.
[time=1858] Listen, if you don't like what you've been seeing, then change what you've been saying.
[time=1864] Amen, somebody.
[time=1866] For your words are shaping your world.
[time=1870] What we say, they are performing or they're shaping things all around us.
[time=1875] If you don't like what you've been seeing, change what you've been seeing.
[time=1879] We've got to keep on saying what God says.
[time=1882] And so we've got to look at the promise while going through the process because you're headed for a promotion.
[time=1889] Somebody say I'm headed for a promotion.
[time=1891] Yeah, I'm headed for a promotion.
[time=1893] And you've got to understand promotions don't come from the east or the west.
[time=1897] Promotions come from the Lord, our God.
[time=1900] I begin to learn that.
[time=1901] That begin to stir in my heart and stir in my spirit because it doesn't matter the things that are going around us.
[time=1907] In difficult times, what you've got to realize is that's a part of the process.
[time=1912] In fact, the Bible says for now, if need be, we have to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
[time=1919] These have come so that your faith of greater worth and gold that perishes, even though
[time=1925] refined by fire, may be proven genuine.
[time=1928] In other words, the reason why we have to go through difficult times, the reason why we have to go through struggles is to prove that your faith is genuine.
[time=1937] Amen, somebody.
[time=1938] In other words, God's thing is don't just love me just because you know everything is okay.
[time=1944] His thing is, will you rejoice in the Lord even when things aren't going your way.
[time=1949] Even when they don't feel like, somebody say favor.
[time=1953] I want you to see the favor of the Lord because this is what kept Joseph going because here
[time=1959] we read the story at the end of his life and God began to do some things that really blessed me because we saw that God was with him all the time.
[time=1968] Even when he was thrown into the pit.
[time=1970] Even when he went through the prison and now he's promoted to the palace.
[time=1975] The thing is, is God was with him the favor of God.
[time=1979] The grace of God was with him all the time.
[time=1983] I have to use the code of many colors just one more time.
[time=1987] If you don't mind, thank you so much.
[time=1989] Y'all then I came with props.
[time=1992] No, one of the members was so kind at the first celebration to give me this beautiful
[time=1999] shawl.
[time=2000] It reminded me of the code of many colors and I said I need to put it on.
[time=2005] Somebody say favor.
[time=2007] Favor means favor it.
[time=2010] It means that you have been wrapped in grace.
[time=2016] It means that the grace of God has been wrapped around you.
[time=2021] Joseph had the coat of many colors and the coat of many colors was wrapped around him.
[time=2030] While the coat of many colors was wrapped around him, it represented what we have as
[time=2036] believers.
[time=2037] For by grace are we saved through faith.
[time=2040] That not of ourselves but a gift of God, not by works less any man should boast.
[time=2045] In other words, God said because you love me, you become my new favorite.
[time=2050] Let a difficult time come but God said you know what, I've got you wrapped in grace.
[time=2056] I've got grace wrapped around you so whatever you go through, you can go through it with
[time=2062] your head held up.
[time=2063] The reason why your head is held up is not because of you, it's because of the grace of God.
[time=2069] We have this treasure in earthen jars of clay to show that this also passing great power
[time=2076] is from God and not from us.
[time=2081] So what are you doing difficult times when you're beaten up and the coat of many colors is stripped off of you.
[time=2088] They took the coat of many colors.
[time=2090] They threw him in a pit.
[time=2092] What do you do when you're down in the dumps, in the dungeons?
[time=2095] Let me tell you something, when you understand the grace of God is on your life, even though you're stripped of many things, you might lose your job but you still have joy.
[time=2105] Joseph had something about him that even when he was stripped of his coat, he still had his swagger.
[time=2111] It was something about God's grace that no matter what I go through, because God's grace is on me, I still got my swagger.
[time=2118] I don't care who talks about you.
[time=2120] I don't care who thinks bad of you.
[time=2122] If you know that your hope is in the Lord and your strength is in the Lord, then you're already seated in the heavenly realm.
[time=2130] You're already seated in heavenly places.
[time=2132] Amen everybody.
[time=2134] Hallelujah.
[time=2136] Glory.
[time=2137] And so let love and faithfulness never leave you.
[time=2141] Buying them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.
[time=2146] Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.
[time=2153] Trust in the Lord, the next verse says, with all your heart.
[time=2157] And lean not to your own understanding.
[time=2159] In all of your ways, acknowledge him and he will direct your path.
[time=2166] There's something about the favor of God that I want you to use with me just in these
[time=2172] last few moments, just to make a declaration.
[time=2175] We start off every celebration like we did here today declaring the promises of God
[time=2181] over our lives.
[time=2182] But I want to give us today a confession of faith or the faithful.
[time=2187] Here's a confession of the faithful.
[time=2190] Simply we've got to make sure that we say what we heard.
[time=2195] God say until you see what you say.
[time=2198] You have to say what you heard.
[time=2201] You said, wait a minute pastor, what if I'm in a difficult time?
[time=2204] You need to say, guess what, but God promised I'm coming out of this.
[time=2208] What if you have all kind of difficulties on your job and you know the person who's on your job, they always have something negative that's pushing on you.
[time=2217] It seems like you keep giving the same project or a project that you don't want.
[time=2222] What's going to happen?
[time=2223] What do you do?
[time=2224] Guess what?
[time=2225] You keep your head held up and you say what you heard until you see what you say.
[time=2231] You've got to understand that if God said it, then that settles it.
[time=2235] Whether you believe it or not, if God said it, that settles it.
[time=2238] And so here's what you're going to do.
[time=2240] I want you to say these three things and just give you the quick context.
[time=2244] When Joseph, because he was favorite of God, he had two sons as he was getting ready for
[time=2251] his promotion.
[time=2252] And the first one he named Manasseh, which meant forget or it means to forgive.
[time=2258] Let me tell you something, if you're ever going to get the best that God has for you, there's some things you just got to let go of.
[time=2265] There's some things you just got to leave behind you.
[time=2267] There's some things you can't hold, listen, you can't receive a blessing if you're holding on to the past.
[time=2273] [AMEN - 1 seconds] And so he learned to forget, which means to forgive.
[time=2281] And then he was fruitful.
[time=2283] Manasseh's name meant forget.
[time=2287] Ephraim meant double fruitfulness.
[time=2291] And so I want you to say this with me.
[time=2294] Because of my God who is my strength, I'm favored, I'm forgiven, and I'm fruitful.
[time=2306] Oh, you ought to get excited about that right here.
[time=2310] Now say I'm favored.
[time=2312] Say I'm favored, I'm forgiven, and I'm fruitful.
[time=2318] You're speaking to your harvest right now.
[time=2321] That's what the word reminds us of.
[time=2323] The abundance from the abundance of the heart to mouth speaks.
[time=2328] Life and death is in the power of the tongue.
[time=2331] The word of God reminds us the importance of what we say.
[time=2336] And so you say what you heard until you see what you say.
[time=2340] It's amazing.
[time=2341] Because all that Joseph went through, God said, I'm just going to make you forget.
[time=2346] I'm just going to get it out of your mind.
[time=2348] And it's going to be so far to your mind that the blessing, your ladder, will be so much greater than your former.
[time=2356] I'm out of time, but the best is yet to come.
[time=2360] Give God a praise in the house.
[time=2379] Wow, that was great.
[time=2383] Thanks again, Reverend Terry for those words.
[time=2386] And it's beautiful to think.
[time=2388] Didn't you love that his church has been focused on the same theme that our church has been in all summer, but we just didn't even know it.
[time=2394] I think that's God at work, and I love that.
[time=2398] I'm not nearly as exciting as Reverend Terry, but I do have some thoughts to share with you before we sing some more.
[time=2405] You can respond as you feel led, but I probably won't do it quite the same way he does.
[time=2411] It's awesome.
[time=2412] I really loved it.
[time=2413] You know what?
[time=2414] I really love what he shared, and I think it's important for us to remember that God's ways on our ways.
[time=2420] What I love about reading through the book of Joseph, or the book of Genesis and in the life of Joseph, you know, he references two boys, Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh.
[time=2429] And in chapter 48, Joseph brings those kids to his father, Jacob, and he says, "Jacob, please bless my boys."
[time=2438] Jacob couldn't see very well, and so Joseph had it all set up, and he brought the oldest son so that he'd be in front of Jacob's right hand.
[time=2448] And he brought the next oldest son, so he'd be set up right in front of Jacob's left hand, and so Jacob was going to bless with his right hand, the oldest boy, and his left hand, the youngest boy.
[time=2458] I guess that's just how things were done.
[time=2460] And Joseph thought, you know, Dad can't see very well, so I'm going to bring him real close, and I'm going to put him in the right order.
[time=2466] And you know what Jacob does?
[time=2468] In chapter 48, grandpa Jacob switches his hands, and he puts his right hand of strongest blessing on the youngest boy, and he puts his left hand of the weaker blessing on the oldest boy.
[time=2484] Now think back with me, remember Jacob, the deceiver?
[time=2489] He was the younger of the twins that received the strongest blessing instead of the weakest blessing, and then think back with me about Joseph being the younger of the boys who gets all the favor in the code of many colors, which is cool to think about.
[time=2506] The way things are supposed to go, according to culture, aren't always the way things happen with God, and Jacob knew that, and I think that's why he did the swap before he blessed the boys.
[time=2517] Jesus said that the weak will become the strong, and he swapped the two, and he said, if you want to become greater, you have to become less, and he swapped the two.
[time=2529] And he told the story about going to a wedding feast, and he said, if you want to sit in that seat of honor, then you go to the seat of the lowest position first, and then wait till the bride in the groom asks you to join them at the seat of honor, and he swapped the hands.
[time=2544] And you think about the promises of God and how his ways on our ways, and sometimes things feel like we just got the big swap, and we got the lesser end of the deal, but God has a promise for us that isn't always on this earth.
[time=2557] Sometimes we live in a land of slavery like the Hebrews did when they were in Egypt, and we live our whole life in this land of slavery, and we feel pretty swapped.
[time=2567] But then we know that God promises that life after death is with him, and it's nearness to God, and it's to our good, and there's hope at the end of the day, and at the end of our lives there's hope.
[time=2581] And so I think it's important to remember that as we say the promises of God, that they aren't necessarily going to happen immediately, but they will happen in his time and in his ways.
[time=2595] And sometimes even after we leave this earth, but that's okay, because I think in a million and two years from now, when we're all hanging out around the throne, that we'll look back on the 80 some years that he's given us, and we won't really mind.
[time=2611] That's what I think.
[time=2613] This morning we're going to end by singing the song together that you know, and I hope you love, just take my life and let it be consecrated to him, take my moments and my days, take my words, take my feet where they should go.
[time=2626] And I just want us to end our time this morning, dedicating our hearts to him, and trusting in his ways that aren't our ways that he has the best plan for our lives.
[time=2638] Why don't you stand to your feet, and the words are going to come on the screen, and we're just going to sing our heads off, and our hearts off together, and just ask that God would take us and make us into what he wants us to be.
[time=2654] Take my life and let it be consecrated to him, take my moments and my days, let them flow and seize this praise.
[time=2676] Take my hands and let them move, have the impulse of the love.
[time=2687] Take my feet and let them be, strength and beautiful for thee.
[time=2699] Take my voice, take my voice and let it sing, always only for my King.
[time=2713] Take my lips and let them be, fill with messages for me.
[time=2724] Take my silver and my gold, not a night would I withhold.
[time=2736] Take my intellect and use every power as you choose.
[time=2749] Here am I, take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life.
[time=2774] Take my will and make it mine.
[time=2779] It shall be no longer mine.
[time=2785] Take my heart, it is I know.
[time=2790] It shall be thy road from, take my life, my life home, that your feet is treasure so.
[time=2807] Take myself and I will be, ever only, all for thee.
[time=2820] Here am I, take my life, take my life, take my life.
[time=2836] Take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life.
[time=2863] Here am I, take my life, take my life, take my life.
[time=2879] Take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life.
[time=2879] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 151 seconds] Take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life, take my life....
[time=3047] Behold, heed, cut, write it all right on the clouds, shining up, take the sun, let the trumpets fall, yeah.
[time=3072] Listen, you didn't have told your voice, it's a year after you've believed.

[time=3303] And these are the days of Ezekiel, shining like the sun, shining like the sun, and the trumpets fall, lift your voice, it's a year after you've believed.
[time=3331] And these are the days of Ezekiel, shining like the sun, shining like the sun, shining like the sun.
[time=3349] It's a year after you've believed, it's a year after you've believed.
[time=3378] [AMEN]
[time=3386] Amen, stand to your feet, let's sing a little bit more together, sing there's no God like Jehovah, here we go.
