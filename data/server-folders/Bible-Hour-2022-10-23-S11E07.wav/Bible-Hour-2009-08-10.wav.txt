[time=47] - We are the Church of Christ.
[time=53] Ephesians 3, 10 through 11.
[time=55] His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to all the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms.
[time=64] According to his eternal purpose, which he accomplished in Messiah Jesus, our Lord.
[time=71] Ephesians 3, 10 through 11.
[time=73] We are the Church of Christ.
[time=75] [MUSIC - 108 seconds]
[time=186] We are the body of Christ.
[time=191] Ephesians 1 says that God placed all things under Christ's feet and appointed to Him to be head over everything for the church, which is His body.
[time=205] The fullness of Him who fills everything in every way.
[time=209] Ephesians 1, 22 through 23, we are the body of Christ.

[time=416] (choir singing)
[time=475] - This morning, Tony Opelger, Tony's gonna be sharing to you today from the Word of God, and I'm excited about what he put.
[time=483] What God has put on Tony's heart.
[time=486] Tony and I have been friends for several years.
[time=488] My first Sunday, I believe, here at Black Caucus, worship leader Tony and I met afterwards and we've been friends ever since, or homies ever since, like he likes to say.
[time=499] Anyway, most of you probably know Tony, but if you don't, he's served in several capacities at our church, and most recently, we got to send them out June 1st.
[time=509] He began his work kind of on his own over there at Northeast Christian Church over on Stellhorn, and he's in charge of leadership, and he's kind of like a senior pastor role over there in charge of teaching and shepherding that body. Tony's wife, I'm gonna go on and on, is Hannah, and many of you know Hannah Coache, now Hannah Opelger, who I'm excited to announce. I don't know why he's giving me the privilege of doing this, but on Christmas Day, Hannah's due with their first child, and so that's awesome and exciting news.
[time=539] Anything else you want me to tell him?
[time=546] It's a girl. That's exciting too.
[time=549] If you need any tips or you want to learn from my ways and errors with girls,
[time=555] just give me a call.
[time=556] So I'm excited for what Tony's gonna share.
[time=560] Yeah, I just want to say a couple things.
[time=563] First, I always would tell this to the students at TUFW, Taylor University, Fort Wayne, where I served the last seven years, when Corbin would come down, I would say something like this.
[time=574] I was in Corbin's wedding, and Corbin was in my wedding.
[time=578] Therefore, we are homies.
[time=581] Therefore, Corbin's been a great encouragement to me, and I just praise the Lord for him. Thank you, brother.
[time=588] I just want to tell you all that it is such a blessing
[time=596] to get to be here this morning, not just to serve in this way, which is a blessing and an honor, but just to be here.
[time=603] As Corbin just mentioned, Hannah and I, we grew up among all of you.
[time=609] We're part of Blackhawk Christian School and part of this church family, and I was baptized right up there behind that screen.
[time=618] We were married about right here.
[time=622] We had the opportunity to serve in all kinds of ways.
[time=625] I was an elder this past year.
[time=627] Up until, as Corbin mentioned on June 1st, you all sent us out to go help lead and shepherd and teach the Northeast Christian church community.
[time=638] And our building is just right around the corner on Stelhorn Road, and they are a kind, gracious, loving people.
[time=644] They're quickly becoming our family, but I have to tell you that you all, Blackhawk Church, will always be our family.
[time=652] And so it's just a blessing to look out and see so many familiar faces.
[time=656] It's an honor to get to be here today.
[time=659] Let me pray before we jump into the teaching. Let's pray together.
[time=666] Father, together, we ask that you would have your way among us during these moments.
[time=674] We ask that you would be king.
[time=676] We pray, God, that the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts would be pleasing in your sight.
[time=683] Oh, Lord, our rock and our Redeemer.
[time=686] We pray this in Jesus' name, and everyone agreed and said, Amen.
[time=691] Okay. I have a few questions for us this morning.
[time=699] Do you ever dream about that word?
[time=705] Does it consume you in any way, shape, or form?
[time=711] Have you ever had it that you went to bed at night and you were thinking about this word or woke up in the morning and it was the first thing on your mind?
[time=719] Do you have any stirrings or longings or desires related to that?
[time=726] When you think about raising your children or your grandchildren or the shape of your career,
[time=732] does this have an important role in those decisions?
[time=736] Do you ever dream about the church?
[time=742] If you have your Bibles today, you can turn together to Ephesians.
[time=746] Ephesians is a letter in the middle of the New Testament, and as you're going there, I'll give just a little background information on this letter, which we call Ephesians.
[time=755] It was written by the Apostle Paul, while Paul was in Rome, in the city of Rome, on house arrest,
[time=762] waiting to go on trial before the Caesar.
[time=765] And we believe this happened sometime in the early 60s AD.
[time=769] And this letter was what they call a circular letter.
[time=773] In other words, it was meant to circulate from one church community to another in and around
[time=780] the city of Ephesus, which is in modern day Turkey.
[time=784] And Paul, in this letter, writes some absolutely incredible things about the church.
[time=793] One of them is here in Ephesians 3 starting in verse 10.
[time=797] It says, "His intent, God's intent, was that now through the church, through the church,
[time=807] the manifold wisdom." Manifold, that means many-sided.
[time=811] Picture in your mind a diamond with its many beautiful sides.
[time=815] The manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the
[time=821] heavenly realms, through the church.
[time=824] According to his eternal purpose, which he accomplished in Messiah Jesus, our Lord.
[time=831] Wow.
[time=832] John Piper calls that the cosmic calling of the church.
[time=837] Could it be, brothers and sisters, that the way that we live together as the church could
[time=844] actually show the beauty and the wisdom of God, not just to the neighbors around us,
[time=852] not just to the city of Fort Wayne, not just to the nations, but even to the angelic beings
[time=858] and powers in the heavenly realms?
[time=863] Do you ever dream about the church?
[time=870] Well, this morning, it has been my hope and prayer that God would work in such a way
[time=876] that we would all be moved toward, stirred up a little bit towards dreaming about the church.
[time=885] And I'm going to, I want to confess right up front here, I'm going to stir the pot just a little bit today, a couple times.
[time=892] I have the advantage of being able to stir the pot and then run away this morning.
[time=898] I'm really thankful for that.
[time=901] But I'm going to start stirring this way.
[time=904] It is also my hope and prayer that after today, none of you would ever go to church again.
[time=918] I've been praying this.
[time=919] It is my hope and prayer that after today you would never, ever go to church ever again.
[time=931] Now, before I get in trouble, I better explain a little bit about what I mean.
[time=937] It really has everything to do with glasses.
[time=945] I wish you guys could see, but I could see this is really awesome.
[time=950] This is actually also the first time that I've ever felt like Bono.
[time=958] We all, to one degree or another, wear a set of glasses through which we see the world.
[time=966] And these glasses help to shape and tint how we view things, how we view life, how we view the world.
[time=975] And these glasses that we wear also shape and tint how we view and think about and talk about the church.
[time=986] And we will call these the cultural glasses.
[time=991] These are the cultural glasses.
[time=1000] This is the first time that I've ever felt like Kelly Bird.
[time=1005] There is, however, another pair of glasses that we as followers of Jesus want to constantly be working to put on.
[time=1015] And we call these, we will call these the biblical glasses.
[time=1020] The biblical glasses and these glasses help us to see life and the world through the lens of God's Word, the Bible.
[time=1030] And these glasses also help us to see and think about and talk about the church through the lens of God's Word, the Bible.
[time=1042] When we change glasses from the cultural to the biblical, our vision is changed.
[time=1051] Our vision of the church is changed.
[time=1057] When we have these glasses on, the cultural glasses, think about it.
[time=1061] How do we view the church?
[time=1065] Well, how do we talk about the church? In our culture, the church is a building.
[time=1074] We say things like we're driving by the church or let's drive to the church or right now we might say we are in a church.
[time=1084] So in our culture, when we have these glasses on, the church is a building.
[time=1089] Also in our culture, the church is a place.
[time=1094] It's a place, we say things like this is a place where people come to hear a message.
[time=1100] Or this is a place where people come to experience God.
[time=1106] Or this is a place where people should always wear ties.
[time=1112] I was going to wear jeans today, Corbin kind of talked me out of it a little bit, so I was going to say a place where people should never wear jeans when they're speaking.
[time=1122] In our culture, church is a building or a place.
[time=1128] The church is also, when we look through these biblical lenses, a meeting time or a service.
[time=1135] We say things like church starts at 1045 or after the service, we'll ask one another.
[time=1142] How was church today?
[time=1145] These are all cultural ways to view the church.
[time=1152] And what I want to encourage us to do together today and if you're willing from this point forward is to do our best to try to take off these cultural glasses.
[time=1165] And I recognized and admit that just like if you are not able to see well and you take off your glasses, it can be a bit awkward or uncomfortable or even slightly irritating.
[time=1179] But I want to encourage us brothers and sisters to try to take off these glasses and to try our best to put on the biblical glasses.
[time=1192] When we put on these biblical glasses, we see that in the Bible specifically in the New Testament, the word that is used to translate into church in the English is ecclesia, ecclesia, it's up there on the screen.
[time=1209] And this word is used 111 times throughout the New Testament to refer to believers.
[time=1220] In the centuries, in the few centuries before the time of the New Testament, this word was used by the Greek culture around them to describe a gathering of citizens.
[time=1231] In fact, the New Testament uses it that way three times, a secular gathering of citizens.
[time=1239] But when you begin to read through those other 111 uses of this word ecclesia, you see very quickly that these first followers of Jesus took this word ecclesia and infused a slightly different meaning into it.
[time=1259] When you read through those 111 passages that use this word ecclesia that we translate church, you see that it almost always and exclusively refers to the people.
[time=1275] It almost always and exclusively refers to the community of believers, the community of God's redeemed people.
[time=1288] Here are a few examples of its use in the New Testament. Luke uses it this way, Acts 9, 31. Then the church, the community of God's redeemed people throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace.
[time=1302] Paul uses it to begin in two Corinthians 1, 1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, to the church, the people of God in Corinth.
[time=1313] And John uses it this way in Revelation 1, 4. John to the seven churches, to the seven communities of believers in the province of Asia.
[time=1323] In the Bible, when we put on these glasses, we see that the church is the community of believers.
[time=1334] It's the people. And I know that you all here have been chalked talking about and wanting to be disciples, followers of Jesus, so we could say it that way.
[time=1344] The church, when we look through these glasses, is the community of disciples.
[time=1351] And sometimes in the New Testament, it refers to all of the believers, all the disciples around the world throughout all of time. Theologians just call that the universal church.
[time=1364] But oftentimes, like in these passages that we just saw, it refers to the community of disciples in a region, or in a city, or in a locality.
[time=1374] So therefore, Blackhawk is a church. Or in other words, Blackhawk, you all are a community of disciples.
[time=1387] So, biblically speaking, we right now are not in a church. We are in the church's building.
[time=1400] Biblically speaking, we are not having church right now. We are gathered as the church.
[time=1410] And biblically speaking, we do not ever, ever go to church. We are the church.
[time=1422] We are the church. That is so important. Let's say it all together on the count of three. One, two, three. We are the church.
[time=1436] Is it okay if I gently challenge you for a moment?
[time=1445] Yes, okay. I don't know what I was going to do if you said no.
[time=1452] I'll challenge you this way. I encourage you this way. What were the four or five words or phrases that you wrote down just a few moments ago or thought about just a few moments ago related to that word church?
[time=1466] Were they more cultural or biblical? Which set of glasses did you have on when you wrote those?
[time=1477] Can I encourage you/challenge you, Blackhawk, my family, to change the way that you use the word church?
[time=1488] Make the change from the cultural use of it to the biblical use of it. Because I believe that the way that we use this word church is so important.
[time=1499] Not only because it's an indicator of which of these glasses we have on, but I believe it is so important because it shapes our very ability to be the church God is calling us to be.
[time=1512] It shapes our ability to be the church God is calling us to be. Not too many of us are going to dream about the church building.
[time=1523] Not too many of us are going to dream about sitting through a church service.
[time=1529] But I believe that every one of us, every one of us, if encouraged, could dream about being a part of a church, a community of disciples that is together living out the life and the mission that God desires for us.
[time=1553] When we change glasses, our vision is changed. And we see that we are the church.
[time=1564] But not only that, when we change glasses from the cultural to the biblical, our vision is lifted. Our vision of the church is lifted toward this incredibly high view of what it means to be the church.
[time=1582] And so in the letter of Ephesians, Paul begins the first half of the letter. He lifts the vision of the church.
[time=1592] And in those first three chapters, he gives three images of the church, three images of the identity and the calling of the church.
[time=1603] Again, when we change glasses, not only is our vision changed, but our vision is lifted. Our vision is lifted to see an incredibly high view of what it means to be the church.
[time=1619] And Paul does just this. He lifts our vision in these first three chapters of Ephesians, and he does so in part by giving us three images of the church. And here's the first image.
[time=1634] The church is the temple of God. The church is the temple of God. And Ephesians 2, starting in verse 19, Paul writes this.
[time=1646] Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Messiah Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
[time=1663] Now, I want to pause there. We do not have the opportunity this morning to dive too deeply into this, but I want to make this point as clearly as possible.
[time=1673] Any high vision of the church must be preceded by an even higher vision of the Lord Jesus.
[time=1691] And here he is called the chief cornerstone. The cornerstone in that time was the stone that was set in place first.
[time=1699] It was the most important stone in the entire building, more important than the foundation itself.
[time=1707] And in the ancient Near East, the name of the king would often be inscribed on the cornerstone.
[time=1715] And here Paul is telling us that Jesus is the most important. When it comes to the church, when it comes to dreaming about the church, Jesus is the most important.
[time=1726] He is the one who determines the shape and the stability of the entire structure, just like the cornerstone.
[time=1734] He is the king, and not only is his name inscribed on the stone, but he himself is the chief cornerstone.
[time=1744] Paul continues on and says, verse 21, "In him, in Jesus, the whole building is joined together."
[time=1754] That's a masonry term. And it has to do with the process of fitting the stones rightly together, one next to the other.
[time=1763] So in him, the whole building is joined together in that way and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
[time=1772] And in him, in Jesus, you too, you plural also are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.
[time=1788] Wow. Think about that. A dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.
[time=1797] To understand some of the gravity of this, we must be reminded just a little bit about the temple.
[time=1804] You'll recall that in the Hebrew Scriptures, which we call the Old Testament, we see God instructing his people to build him a dwelling place.
[time=1813] At first, it was a moveable one called the tabernacle, and then once the people were settled in the land, he had them build a more permanent structure which was called the temple.
[time=1823] And the temple was the place on earth where God dwelled.
[time=1829] The temple was the place on the whole earth where the presence and glory of God were most often seen.
[time=1837] The temple was, in a sense, the intersection of heaven and earth.
[time=1843] The temple was a really big deal.
[time=1847] And here now, Paul is writing that the church, the community of disciples, is the temple.
[time=1857] The church, not the building, not the time or the place, but the community is to be a dwelling place for the living God.
[time=1869] Can you imagine brothers and sisters what it would be like to be a part of a community in and through whom the living God manifests his presence and glory in such a way that hearts and lives are radically transformed?
[time=1886] Can you imagine being part of a community in and through whom the living God makes himself known to the neighbors around us, to the city of Fort Wayne and to the nations?
[time=1905] When we put on these biblical glasses, we see that we are, we together are the church, and we also see that we together are to be the temple of the living God.
[time=1922] Church, Blackhawk, my family, that is your identity.
[time=1933] That is your calling.
[time=1936] And that is the first of the three images that Paul gives us.
[time=1941] The second of those images is coming up on the screen.
[time=1946] That is part of my family. That is my mom's side of the family, the Schlichman family.
[time=1953] So, I am half Opeliger, half Schlichman, and I married a co-watch.
[time=1962] Just by the names alone, you can tell why I am just a little bit weird.
[time=1968] The church is the family of God.
[time=1974] Paul says in Ephesians 3, "For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name."
[time=1987] And back toward the very beginning of the letter, he said this, "In love, he predestined us to be adopted as his sons and daughters through Jesus the Messiah."
[time=1998] So, therefore, in Jesus, we have become children of God, and that is what we are.
[time=2007] And that makes us brothers and sisters.
[time=2015] So, it's no mistake, then, that the most common image is you read through the New Testament, the most common image that is used for the church is the family of God.
[time=2025] Over and over again, they call each other brother or sister, or even in one place mother or father.
[time=2031] The church, the community of disciples, is a family.
[time=2036] It's called to be a network of intimate, loving relationships.
[time=2044] A network of intimate, loving relationships where we love one another with an unusual kind of love.
[time=2053] A love that goes beyond the differences that normally separate people in this world.
[time=2059] A love that moves past the superficial and goes into something deep and real.
[time=2065] And a love that is sacrificial and radical and life-giving.
[time=2072] Can you imagine being a part of a church, a church family, a community that is like that with radical, unusual love for one another?
[time=2084] Can you imagine being a part of a community who shows what God's unusual love is like to the neighbors around us, to the city of Fort Wayne, and to the nations?
[time=2095] Can you imagine? I know that some of you can. I cannot say it any better than what Dr. Gilbert Bilizikian, former Wheaton College professor, says it in this quote which I'd like to read for us.
[time=2106] He wrote, "Imagine a community of believers dream about it who are so totally devoted to God that their life together is charged with the Spirit's power.
[time=2121] In that band of Christ followers, believers love each other with a radical kind of love."
[time=2128] And here's what happens. They remove their masks and share their lives with one another.
[time=2134] They laugh and cry and pray and sing and serve together in authentic Christian fellowship.
[time=2142] Those who have more share freely with those who have less until socioeconomic barriers melt away.
[time=2149] People relate together in ways that bridge gender and racial chasms and celebrate cultural difference.
[time=2156] This community of believers, this church, offers unbelievers a vision of life that is so beautiful.
[time=2166] It takes their breath away. It is so bold, so creative, so dynamic.
[time=2172] They cannot resist it, and God adds to their numbers daily.
[time=2178] When we put on the biblical glasses, we see that we together are the church.
[time=2188] And we also see that we together are to be the family of God.
[time=2196] And church, Blackhawk, again, that is your identity. That is your calling.
[time=2208] And that, again, is the second of the images of the church.
[time=2213] And the third image that Paul gives us is what we see on the screen.
[time=2218] The church is the body of Jesus.
[time=2223] And at the end of Ephesians 1, starting in verse 22, it says this.
[time=2228] And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body.
[time=2241] The fullness of him, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
[time=2249] And this image, this truth, is taught in a number of places throughout the New Testament, even later on in chapters four and five of this very letter.
[time=2259] And oftentimes, we emphasize the horizontal aspect of this image, which is good and right and true.
[time=2268] We talk about finding our roles within the body.
[time=2273] One person's the arm, one person is the leg, one person is the foot, and so on and so forth.
[time=2279] It's about finding unity in the midst of diversity.
[time=2283] And like I said, that's good and right and true, but it is horizontal.
[time=2288] And I believe I would like to suggest today that here Paul is emphasizing the vertical aspect of this image.
[time=2297] Jesus is the head and we, the church, are his body.
[time=2303] And so therefore, the church during this age is called to be his body in the world.
[time=2312] We are to be the fullness of him, the fullness of him.
[time=2317] What we see Jesus doing, we together by his spirit are to do.
[time=2324] The church is called to be in a real and mysterious way Jesus in the world.
[time=2334] I'll say that again.
[time=2335] The church is called to be in a real and yet very mysterious way Jesus in and to the world.
[time=2344] So where we see Jesus proclaiming truth and grace, we together by his spirit proclaim truth and grace.
[time=2353] Where we see Jesus fixing that which is broken, we together by his spirit are to fix that which is broken.
[time=2363] And where we see Jesus suffering for and serving the world around us, we together by his spirit are to suffer for and to serve the world around us.
[time=2374] Can you imagine being a part of a community that is together by his spirit being used to bring people into his kingdom?
[time=2384] Can you imagine being a part of a community that is together by his spirit being used to change the world for the better for his glory?
[time=2398] When we put on these biblical glasses, we see that we together are the church.
[time=2403] And we also see that we together are to be the body of Jesus.
[time=2409] And again church, that is your, that is our identity.
[time=2415] That is our calling.
[time=2418] Three images, an absolutely incredible identity and an extremely high calling.
[time=2428] Could you dream about being a part of something like that?
[time=2438] I know and believe that some of you, maybe many of us here today, have caught a glimpse, have seen a glimpse of this, have seen a glimpse of the church being the church.
[time=2453] And if you are like me, you want to see and experience that more and more and more for the glory of God.
[time=2462] In a couple moments, we're going to go into a time of communion and we're going to sing together or worship together through song.
[time=2471] But before we do that, I have a few questions that I'd just like to gently ask you.
[time=2477] First, when you think about being the church, when you think about being a part of a community of disciples,
[time=2491] who do you think of?
[time=2495] What are the faces that come to your mind?
[time=2498] What are the names?
[time=2503] When you think about being the church, who comes to your mind?
[time=2506] Maybe these people are already around you.
[time=2509] Maybe you're in an ABF community together or a home community or a discipling community or maybe they're neighbors that live around you.
[time=2518] Second question, what would it be like for you to come together with those people in this next season and to ask God to help you to be the church together?
[time=2536] What would it be like for you to come and to ask Him even to beg Him together to move you toward being joined together?
[time=2545] You remember that Mason return being joined together like those stones in such a way that you would be the temple of the living God?
[time=2555] What would it be like for you to come together and to ask Him to move you toward loving one another in such a way as to be the family of God?
[time=2566] What would it be like for you to come together in this next season and to ask Him to beg Him to move you to be spirit-led and mission-oriented in such a way as to be the body of Jesus?
[time=2580] What would it be like for you to commit for a season with those God has already placed around you to intentionally pursue these things?
[time=2590] And if you are already doing that, what would it be like for you to do so more and more and more in this next season?
[time=2599] My prayer is that you, Black Hawk Church, would be a people who dream together about being the church, the fullness of Him, everything that God desires for you during this time in this place with these people.
[time=2622] God has given you and will give you everything that you need to pursue being the church.
[time=2631] This is His design. It's His desire. We could even say that it is His dream and He will provide. He is able. Paul ends the first half of that letter in Ephesians this way.
[time=2648] It says, "Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more, immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, all that we could dream about."
[time=2661] According to His power, that is at work within us together.
[time=2669] To Him be the glory in the church, the community of disciples, and in Messiah Jesus throughout all generations, including our generation today, forever and ever. Amen.

[time=3446] And may the result of that be that the neighbors around us, the city of Fort Wayne, the nations,
[time=3453] and even the angelic beings and powers in the heavenly realms sing for joy.
[time=3460] And may the result of all that be his glory and praise.
[time=3465] In the name of Jesus and everyone agreed and said, Amen.
