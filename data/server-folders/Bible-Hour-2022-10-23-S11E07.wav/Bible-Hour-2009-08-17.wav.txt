[time=1006] Autumn, the fall.
[time=1009] Things still good, but things are changing.
[time=1014] You know what I mean?
[time=1016] And while we can sense that in the weather and we can sense that, you know, with what's going
[time=1023] on around us again this morning, we also know that there are times like this where this
[time=1029] is very much present in your life and your soul and your world.
[time=1034] And while leaves are changing, sometimes lives are changing.
[time=1039] And oftentimes these seasons of change and transition, we get a sense that they're coming.
[time=1046] Things begin to happen.
[time=1047] Things begin to take place.
[time=1050] For you in the room this morning who would find yourself in this season of Autumn, you
[time=1056] found that the cloud that we talked about with our summer friends is a lot closer.
[time=1063] It's a lot bigger.
[time=1066] Things are changing in your world.
[time=1068] There are transitions occurring that truth be told have you nervous, uncertain, lonely,
[time=1074] afraid, maybe job related.
[time=1079] It may be health related.
[time=1083] It may be family related.
[time=1087] You may have a baby on the way.
[time=1091] You may have just delivered a little one and your life's just full of change and transition.
[time=1099] Maybe you just got married.
[time=1102] Maybe you just hard to believe, but maybe you just dropped that son or daughter off at college,
[time=1112] and you never, ever imagined would come, but it's come and gone and now she or he is there and you're here.
[time=1120] Could be a lot going on with family, with your health, with your job, and your relationships.
[time=1128] Relationships might be changing.
[time=1131] Those who were once close aren't.
[time=1134] Those who were once distant you're getting closer to.
[time=1138] That's natural, maybe that's not good.
[time=1142] Maybe you're doing your best to anticipate changes and shifts in your marriage, in your relationship
[time=1151] with a spouse.
[time=1153] You're not sure exactly how it's all going to turn out, but you sense change is coming.
[time=1158] The waters are definitely not blue and calm anymore.
[time=1163] They're starting to get choppy.
[time=1165] The potential for darker days is definitely looming.
[time=1169] Down deep in your heart you sense the need to brace yourself for what may be coming.
[time=1175] And for every one of us in the room, for anybody here sensing this season of autumn, for anybody in the room who is living in the midst of what seems to be a changing, shifting reality.
[time=1189] Let me read for you this morning from the book of Philippians.
[time=1192] All of that, all the above, everything I just mentioned, whatever may be brewing, whatever might be stirring,
[time=1202] can oftentimes produce in you and in me in this season of autumn something we call anxiousness,
[time=1209] this worry of what might be, this uncertainty about what's to come.
[time=1214] And let me read to you what Paul says in Philippians chapter 4 verses 6 and 7, he speaks directly to the issue,
[time=1221] be anxious for what, say it, nothing.
[time=1227] And you're sitting there right now and you're saying, are you kidding me?
[time=1232] Everything you just said, all that I'm facing, all that I'm trying to endure here,
[time=1240] I mean, it hasn't even really all come yet, but I'm just, I'm seeing it happen in Kelly.
[time=1245] It's difficult and it's hard and it's scary and it's lonely and I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it and you're telling me that God's Word says be anxious about nothing.
[time=1257] And I'm saying to you this morning, what I've said to you for years, I didn't write it, but I sure am thankful to be able to tell you what it says, and it says be anxious for nothing.
[time=1269] But in everything, all the above, right?
[time=1273] By prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[time=1280] And the peace of God, here's what happens when you're willing to be anxious about nothing through prayer and supplication, begging him for help and thanksgiving because you believe in your heart, he will.
[time=1292] It says because of that, here's what happens.
[time=1295] From the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=1304] All that we mentioned, all that you're facing, all that may be coming.
[time=1309] Your heart will be guarded by the peace of God.
[time=1317] As Corbin plays, listen to what it says in Psalm 37, let this be an encouragement to you this morning.
[time=1325] Those of you in this season of transition, those of you facing change and the uncertainty that comes with it,
[time=1333] says in Psalm 37, 1, do not fret. Do not fret because of evil doers, be not envious toward wrong doers,
[time=1341] for they will wither quickly like the grass and fade like the green herb.
[time=1346] Trust in the Lord and do good.
[time=1350] Dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.
[time=1353] Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.
[time=1359] Watch this now.
[time=1362] Commit your way.
[time=1365] Those of you living in this moment, this morning in uncertainty, in anticipation of change and transition, commit your way to the Lord.
[time=1376] Trust also in him and he will what?
[time=1383] He will do it with all your heads bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=1390] Those of you who find yourself in this season of change, in this season of the soul will call autumn.
[time=1397] Would you stand and would you just do me the honor of praying with you,
[time=1405] praying a prayer for you this morning as you've identified yourself in this place?
[time=1412] Maybe your prayer would go something like this, Father God in heaven.
[time=1416] I stand here today in your presence, sensing a season of change and transition in my life.
[time=1423] Lord, as I watch you at work in my circumstances, I can see that what once was will be no more.
[time=1435] That life will be different, that my faith will be tested, that my belief in your goodness will be stretched,
[time=1446] and that my love and dependence on you will be challenged.
[time=1451] O God, I long to face this autumn of my soul with great confidence and resolve, not in me or my ability to endure it but in you, Lord.
[time=1462] May I walk through these days and nights of change with my confidence and trust in you intact.
[time=1468] May I hold on to the Word of God as the ground begins to shift.
[time=1473] May I hold on to the people of God as the winds begin to blow.
[time=1478] And may I hold on to the Spirit of God as temptation comes my way.
[time=1485] My world is changing, but praise be to you, O God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[time=1494] that you never change, and your faithfulness endures forever.
[time=1499] Walk with me, please, through this, I pray.
[time=1504] And although standing agreed with the prayer and said it, amen.
[time=1515] [MUSIC - 34 seconds]
[time=1573] I thank Hillary Richard for drawing those for us on video there.
[time=1578] A talented young lady, and I'm thankful for her help.
[time=1583] Well, winter.
[time=1588] It's a tough one, isn't it?
[time=1591] There are some in the room today who are trying to endure it.
[time=1598] I never knew much.
[time=1600] I never knew anything at all about enduring winter until we moved here 14 years ago.
[time=1607] But I tell you what, I can remember in the middle of about the second winter,
[time=1613] starting to think about getting my resume out.
[time=1617] And I didn't know, honestly, didn't know if I could endure too many more of those.
[time=1624] You know, it gets cold, and things are different.
[time=1629] And the sun doesn't shine very much, and while we can talk about that in the physical sense again, you and I know that the winter of the soul is a very, very difficult thing to endure.
[time=1641] It's a very real thing.
[time=1643] We see it all through the Scriptures.
[time=1645] We see the psalmist in particular dealing with times of great darkness and doubt and difficulty.
[time=1653] For those of you in this season of life, the cloud, singular cloud that we talked about
[time=1660] a while ago has become cloud's plural.
[time=1664] The sky of your life has turned gray, and be it circumstantial.
[time=1671] You understand that?
[time=1672] Sometimes tough things just happen, right?
[time=1677] I mean, sometimes things get really sideways and really confusing and really hard,
[time=1683] and you and I had nothing to do with it.
[time=1686] It's just a hard season.
[time=1690] So be it circumstantial or self-inflicted, because many of you in the room,
[time=1698] myself included, would also understand that there are times when we do have a part in it.
[time=1704] The darkness and the discouragement, the destruction and the coldness is oftentimes brought about
[time=1714] by choices that we've made.
[time=1717] So be it circumstantial or self-inflicted, there is a turmoil and pain in your soul that runs
[time=1723] deep this morning.
[time=1724] As you sit here in this room, your heart seems to be shrinking.
[time=1731] You can remember a day when it was soft and growing today, and all honesty before him,
[time=1740] you would say it's hardened and shrinking.
[time=1744] Your heart is shrinking, your relationship seemed to be leaving, and your God, who you
[time=1750] cognitively know and your mind loves you, you believe that to be objectively true,
[time=1757] and it is, you know it is, and yet the reality of where your heart and soul finds itself today
[time=1763] is that he seems distant and detached, a long way away.
[time=1771] Your battle with guilt, your battle with regret, your battle with repeated sin, your battle with
[time=1779] the discouragement that comes from all the above, the loneliness that you feel from the loss of
[time=1785] one that you loved, the turmoil of this season of winter in your life, it's not going well
[time=1792] at all.
[time=1793] And you've come to a very lonely, tired, weary place where, listen, where resignation, defeat,
[time=1811] or maybe even compromise, seems like the only way out.
[time=1819] The winds are blowing that heart, the skies that dark, the emptiness you feel, that severe,
[time=1826] and defeat, resignation, or maybe even compromise, maybe the enemy, coming along with you as
[time=1834] he has done with me so many times in those places and just whispering in your ear,
[time=1840] look, just do the wrong thing.
[time=1844] Go ahead, find relief from this winter, find satisfaction in the midst of this dryness,
[time=1852] in the midst of this loneliness and despair, go ahead, just do whatever you need to do
[time=1858] to manipulate circumstances and people and take this thing into your own hands, and those are dark days.
[time=1870] Those are hard times.
[time=1874] Let me read to you.
[time=1876] I mentioned to you that we see this in the scriptures we do in a number of places.
[time=1881] Just briefly, let me read to you what it says in the book of Psalms, the Psalmist in Psalm 22
[time=1891] had some very lonely, dark, hurting words that he shares with us.
[time=1898] It says in Psalm 22, 1 and 2, it says, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[time=1908] Far from, listen, far from my deliverance are the words of my groaning.
[time=1919] And maybe this morning, truth be told, you just find yourself groaning,
[time=1926] just wishing somehow it could be as you know it should be and can be.
[time=1935] For those of you trying to stand in the cold of your struggle, these are days when we simply must cry out to God.
[time=1944] These are days when the truth about God can trump the trial of your soul.
[time=1950] Did you hear that?
[time=1951] These are days and times when the truth about God can trump the trial of your soul.
[time=1960] I want you to listen. Oh, you'll enjoy it, I promise you.
[time=1964] Listen to Marilyn and Marcia as they come this morning.
[time=1968] Listen as they sing and allow them to remind us of what's true.
[time=1974] As they declare once again the never ending, winter enduring promises of God.
[time=1982] I need the every hour, most gracious God.
[time=1993] No tender voice like Thine can peace afford.
[time=2006] I need the oh I need thee.
[time=2015] Every hour I need thee.
[time=2021] Oh bless me now my Savior.
[time=2028] I come to thee.
[time=2035] I need the every hour.
[time=2040] Enjoy your pain.
[time=2045] Come quickly and abide.
[time=2050] Or life is vain.
[time=2056] I need the oh I need thee.
[time=2064] Every hour I need thee.
[time=2070] Oh bless me now my Savior.
[time=2076] I come to thee.
[time=2083] I need the every hour.
[time=2088] Teach me thy will.
[time=2093] And thy rich promises in me fulfill.
[time=2105] I need the oh I need thee.
[time=2113] Every hour I need thee.
[time=2119] Oh bless me now my Savior.
[time=2125] I come to thee.
[time=2134] When peace like a river, attendeth my way.
[time=2146] When sorrows like sea billows roll.
[time=2156] Whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say.
[time=2168] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=2205] My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought.
[time=2216] My sin not impart but the whole.
[time=2226] It is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more.
[time=2236] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord oh my soul.
[time=2248] And Lord, praise the day when my faith shall be sight.
[time=2257] The clouds be rolled back as a scroll.
[time=2266] The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend.
[time=2276] Even so it is well with my soul.
[time=2288] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=2328] Well why don't you close your eyes and bow your heads.
[time=2333] Let me personally invite anybody in the room to just with great courage and with great hope in him.
[time=2343] A God who you know loves you.
[time=2346] A God who has promised to deliver you in his time and place.
[time=2352] I want to just ask you if you find yourself today in a season of winter in your soul to just stand.
[time=2361] If you are sitting next to somebody who you know and love who may be in that spot you may want to just stand with them or you may want to just put your hand on their back.
[time=2370] You may want to do whatever you might need to do to just communicate to them in this moment.
[time=2380] Your love for them and your belief in them.
[time=2384] Let me pray for you.
[time=2385] Let me pray a prayer for you.
[time=2389] Those of you in winter this morning and again it is a privilege to be able to do this with you.
[time=2395] For you it might sound something like this dear God in heaven.
[time=2399] As I stand here this morning I stand in the darkness of my confusion, my hurt, my doubt, my loss.
[time=2409] Be it the result of my own sin or the result of life in this broken world.
[time=2413] I stand here Lord cold and distant from you and that place of intimacy and warmth found only by your side.
[time=2421] Whether because of death and the loss of one that I loved or the sense of death that comes with my continued sin.
[time=2430] I confess to you in this moment a sadness in my soul that's left me weary, discouraged and in mourning.
[time=2441] I'm weary of having to try again discouraged by my repeated failures and mourning the loss of those things and those moments that can never be retrieved.
[time=2452] Oh God I'm sorry, oh God I'm embarrassed, oh God I'm alone, oh God I'm filled with regret, oh God I am, truth be told, anxious.
[time=2466] I'm starving for hope and wondering if your touch will ever come again dear Lord please hold me up.
[time=2475] Please draw near to my shivering soul as I draw near to you and allow the coldness of this season to pass in your time and place.
[time=2487] It is so dark and so cold oh Lord please come quickly and every person standing agreed with the prayer and said amen.
[time=2505] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=2565] I once was lost, but now I'm found, I once was lost, and now I'm found so far away.
[time=2592] But I'm home now, I once was lost, but now I'm found, and now my life's so small.
[time=2609] I once was blind, but now I see, I once was blind, but now I see, I don't know how, but when he touched me, I once was blind, but now I see.
[time=2637] And now my life's all seems, and now my life's all seems, and now my life's all seems.
[time=2658] I once was dead, but now I live, I once was dead, now I live.
[time=2671] And now my life's you I give, and now my life's you I give, and now my life's you I give.
[time=2691] Hallelujah, hallelujah, that my life's all seems to you.
[time=2772] Well, with the difficulty of winter comes the great joy of spring, amen?
[time=2781] And with spring comes some amazing pictures. We've seen some on the screens this morning. I know you can envision if I say, if I say spring to you.
[time=2791] And if I talk about the good days that come following winter, when I talk about what the grass looks like in the garden and the skies and the world we live, we can all just envision some things that bring a smile to the face of one who has endured much.
[time=2808] I think that there are some words that I've always associated with spring, just some of my favorite words. I don't know why over the years these words have just grown to mean so much to me, but they are words that I always connect with this season of the soul.
[time=2824] Words like renewed, words like restored, words like my favorite one of all. Many of you who know me know it's my favorite word of all, redeemed.
[time=2836] There's something about redemption. There's something about being restored. There's something about being renewed. It's just a beautiful picture physically and spiritually when this happens, it is a great day.
[time=2849] And for some of you in the room this morning, truth be told, you find yourself today in a time and a season where your heart and life and soul is feeling renewed.
[time=2860] You've been through a bunch, and yet there seems to be a new day dawning. I'll never forget about three years ago.
[time=2867] It's been about three years that my wife came home one day and shocked and inspired our whole family.
[time=2876] And when she announced to us that she was going to run a mini marathon, I thought she had lost her mind.
[time=2884] I couldn't believe what she was saying, but sure enough, she had committed with some other gals to run in a mini marathon.
[time=2891] I didn't know much about mini marathons. I knew a marathon was 26 miles? Four? Yeah, I knew. I thought I knew. What's a marathon?
[time=2901] I thought it was like half. I'm thinking 13 miles. Sure enough, she set out on her training for this mini marathon.
[time=2913] It was like nothing we'd ever seen. It was just four or five, six days a week. It was increasing mileage each day.
[time=2920] She had a thing on the refrigerator and a little waist belt with water bottles and we're just like, wow.
[time=2927] And she just, she did it. She trained and she prepared and the mini marathon she had chosen to run was out in LA at Disneyland.
[time=2935] So like a good husband, I thought I should go along and support her in that.
[time=2940] So she's in the Disneyland mini marathon with these three or four of their gals and their husbands all went.
[time=2945] So it was a pretty decent time when we get out there and it was the day of the mini marathon.
[time=2949] It was over 45, 50,000 runners. It was quite a sight. I mean the place was, and they ran on the Disney property and then kind of off the property for a while and then back to the property.
[time=2961] And it was just an amazing event. I'll just never forget the four guys. We just, we wanted to do our best to support and encourage.
[time=2968] And so we figured out ways to kind of run with them sort of and then skip over here and meet them at the next mile marker and get in the car and drive three miles down the road.
[time=2976] We were having a blast and we're yelling and screaming. And it was just amazing to me to watch the progression of the run with Deborah at mile two her and all the gals are waving saying get pictures, get pictures.
[time=2987] You know, and when at mile four it's not quite as smiley and not quite as wavy and by mile seven there's tears.
[time=2995] And don't look at me and by mile ten eleven it was bad.
[time=3005] I mean like not funny bad. I mean like crying and pain and it, I mean it was like, can I took me by surprise because while I had been very excited about this whole thing all of a sudden about mile eleven when we caught up with them.
[time=3021] And they were kind of spread out by then she wasn't doing well. I mean her body was like breaking down and mentally she was fading and I'm just thinking wow I'm starting to get a little upset.
[time=3033] We head to the finish line. I just didn't know what to expect. And there we were at the finish line. The place was just packed.
[time=3040] People, cameras, lights everywhere. You know the big stand and the announcer and people coming down the final stretch there and all of a sudden boom there she was just running her her brains out as fast as she could.
[time=3054] And I'll never forget she crosses the line and there's just a, this is bad when there's people everywhere. She crosses the line, she just runs, she sprints through bodies back and forth, comes up to me, buries her head in my chest.
[time=3067] And I throw my arms around her and she just starts crying. You know the gals that, what does she call it, the ugly crying?
[time=3074] Just from way down deep inside and your eyes get all puffy and she's just crying and then we're laughing and then she's crying and then we're laughing and it was just the sweetest thing.
[time=3085] It was just amazing to have endured so much that was so hard and so challenging. And then to be in this moment where all of a sudden it was like, wow, things are going to get better and this is good and I'm so glad I went through that.
[time=3101] And many of you in the room this morning are feeling that. You've crossed the line. It was very difficult. Things started to break down but God has renewed your spirit today.
[time=3114] God has renewed your hope and you sense and can see clearly now that cloud that kind of was there and then kind of came. Now it's, it's leaving.
[time=3125] It's blue skies ahead and I want to just invite you this morning to listen to the words of the psalmist and then I want to, I want to pray with you.
[time=3134] Psalm 27, one of my favorite passages in all of scripture.
[time=3138] I love what it says because I love David. I love David because I know what David endured. I know what he faced. I know what he persevered through.
[time=3148] And in Psalm 27, 13, it begins with these words.
[time=3153] I would have despaired unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the what? The living.
[time=3165] Wait for the Lord. Be strong and let your heart take courage. Yes, wait for the Lord.
[time=3173] And as Corbin plays, I want to ask you to just bow your heads and close your eyes. Let me just read that last line to you again.
[time=3182] Those of you in spring, I want to say this to you. I want to say how grateful I am that you've waited on the Lord.
[time=3191] I want to thank you for being strong and letting your heart take courage.
[time=3197] Yes, you waited on the Lord and the Lord has in his time today, showing you his goodness and his mercy.
[time=3206] I want to invite you to stand this morning quietly. If you find yourself in this season of spring, would you do that?
[time=3214] And allow me the privilege of praying this prayer. Maybe a prayer that would echo the feelings and the thoughts of your own heart and soul this morning.
[time=3226] Dear Father in Heaven, your faithfulness and enduring love amaze me.
[time=3235] I stand here this morning deeply grateful for what feels like a new beginning.
[time=3242] The blessing and encouragement that you've chosen to bestow upon me in my life leaves me speechless.
[time=3249] Lord, I cannot begin to express to you the hopefulness and the promise that has filled my heart in recent days.
[time=3258] The clouds that brought such darkness seem to have moved on, the winds that once blew so hard have subsided.
[time=3264] And with this new day comes new opportunities that you've clearly set before me.
[time=3270] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for bringing blessing to one who doesn't deserve it, for offering new hope to one who's been so unfaithful,
[time=3281] for healing a wounded heart and making whole again a life that was so broken.
[time=3288] Oh, God, I sense you recreating me and re-envisioning my life and my days.
[time=3298] I commit to you in this moment to walk with you down this new road in obedience and trust.
[time=3306] Heavenly Father, it feels so good to breathe again, and may every breath remind me of a God who makes all things new.
[time=3321] Every evening's sky and invitation to trace the pattern stars and early angel life celebration for freedom medicines.
[time=3340] And I notice children's games and those who watch them from the shade.
[time=3350] Every drop of sun is full of fun and one day.
[time=3359] You are sunburned.
[time=3374] And even when the trees come to surrender to the first time.
[time=3384] In forfeiting their knees and leads up to their own.
[time=3390] In sending this inside, still I notice you when change begins.
[time=3398] Thy embrace will come within us.
[time=3403] I will offer thanks for what has been the best of me.
[time=3412] You are a God of you.
[time=3428] And everything in time and under heavy finally falls asleep.
[time=3455] Wrapped in blankets wide on creation.
[time=3460] Shivers underneath, and still I notice you when grandkids crack and end my breath of frost and waves.
[time=3474] Even though in death you will bend doors for life to enter.
[time=3483] You go winter.
[time=3487] And everything that's new has greatly surfaced.
[time=3492] Teaching us to pray on me.
[time=3497] And what was frozen through is newly professed.
[time=3503] Turning up things free so it is with you.
[time=3508] And how you met me now and every single person's changed.
[time=3516] And so it will be as you are free creating me.
[time=3523] Some of our winter is free.
