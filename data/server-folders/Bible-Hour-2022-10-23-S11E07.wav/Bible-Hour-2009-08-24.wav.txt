[time=30] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] I'm so thankful that you've tuned in and we're so thankful to be able to have this time with you this morning.
[time=40] My name's Kelly Bird, and if you're tuning in for the first time, this is the Bible Hour, and we have a privilege here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we have had the privilege for years of sharing with you the life-changing truth of God's Word.
[time=54] And I'm joined this morning by a good friend of mine, Bill Archer.
[time=57] - Good morning.
[time=58] - And Bill is not only a good friend of mine, not only has he been a mentor and a supporter of mine for the 14 years I've been here, but Bill has been in ministry serving here at Black Hawk for 37 years.
[time=73] And we want to share with you this morning in our ongoing effort to try and provide you with as many resources as possible a website that Bill has kind of been behind and a part of.
[time=85] When I say Bill's been serving, Bill's been teaching God's Word here at Black Hawk for years.
[time=91] Bill's been teaching God's Word.
[time=93] We were just talking about it for probably over 40 years, and I know it has meant a great deal to him, and it has been a great deal to many of us here at Black Hawk.
[time=102] And so I want to have Bill tell you about this resource and tell you kind of where it came from and how it's being used.
[time=110] Bill, tell them the name of this website that we want them to know about.
[time=114] You can find the website at TimelessTruthForToday.com.
[time=118] All one word, TimelessTruthForToday.com.
[time=121] TimelessTruthForToday.com.
[time=123] Now this website, this was kind of born out of your teaching ministry in one of our Sunday morning communities, our discovery class.
[time=132] Tell the folks kind of just the story behind how this website came to be.
[time=137] Well, our class has a lot of people that are snowbirds that go to Florida for some reason in the winter.
[time=145] And so they were because of the type of teaching that I do, which is very sequential, each lesson builds on the next one.
[time=154] When they missed, they always came back and said, "Well, we'd really like to catch up." So I thought, "Well, a website would be a good way to do that." And so my son encouraged me along that line, and we set the website up basically for that purpose to catch up to those classes.
[time=171] Awesome.
[time=173] So people can just week after week after week, no matter where they are, keep up with your teaching and keep up with the great encouragement that comes with the Word of God.
[time=183] Tell me, Bill, as I know the answer to this, I want you to share it with the folks who are watching.
[time=188] They may see you on screen here, a little older than me, not much, but just a little.
[time=195] And they may think, "Gosh, is he teaching just a bunch of old people?" And the fact is, Bill's not.
[time=202] I want you to know about the Discovery class.
[time=204] It's a class, really, that has a wide range of demographic, young and old, right?
[time=209] Yeah, we have quite a range.
[time=210] As a matter of fact, we just, one of our class members just had a baby about three months ago.
[time=216] We have another one that's expecting in December.
[time=219] Wow.
[time=220] We're going to get a grandchild there.
[time=221] Wow.
[time=222] And so we have quite a wide range.
[time=224] All the way up to how old?
[time=226] A lot older than me.
[time=228] A lot older.
[time=230] I think that's great.
[time=231] And it's something that we're seeing more and more of today at Blackhawk.
[time=235] Just how God's Word cuts across lines of diversity and age and socioeconomic lines.
[time=241] It's an amazing thing to see.
[time=243] And we want you to know about this website, TimelessTruthForToday.com.
[time=248] And when you go there, you can be encouraged and you can keep up with Bill's teaching.
[time=252] I've listened, have listened to Bill for years and I'm just telling you, and you know me, I wouldn't tell you this if it wasn't true.
[time=259] You'll be encouraged.
[time=261] We're so thankful for your continuous support of the Bible hour.
[time=265] So thankful that we get to spend time like this with you.
[time=268] And I hope you'll look it up.
[time=269] I hope you'll be encouraged.
[time=271] And I hope you'll allow God's Word, His timeless truth to continue to encourage you in your everyday life.
[time=277] God bless you.
[time=278] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=280] But by not physical, I'm in a war.
[time=284] But now in this world, you are the life that's beautiful.
[time=290] And I want more.
[time=292] I want all that joy.
[time=296] Joy, I have to speak of all.
[time=298] It won't go away.
[time=300] Just enough strength to live for your days.
[time=303] So I'll never have to worry.
[time=305] But tomorrow I'll read.

[time=503] [APPLAUSE]
[time=504] - Let's pray together this morning.
[time=507] Would you join me?
[time=509] God, in heaven, we want to submit ourselves to you again this morning collectively and call you the faithful one.
[time=517] We want to put our hope in you.
[time=519] We want to count on you.
[time=521] We want to depend on you.
[time=523] And God, we just ask that you would increase our faith.
[time=527] That you would grow us and grant us that gift of faith and the spiritual fruit of faithfulness in our lives.
[time=533] So that that could impact how we behave and respond to the world around us.
[time=539] God, would you increase our faith and use us to be salt and light in the world around us for your fame and your glory and your praise?
[time=548] Pray this in Jesus' name.
[time=550] [AMEN]
[time=552] [APPLAUSE]
[time=555] - Well, Blackhawk, would you give a warm welcome to Clinton fossil from remedy FM?
[time=559] - Thank you.
[time=560] [APPLAUSE]
[time=563] We've had Clinton in the past.
[time=565] He's come and over the last couple, two or three years, done his best to kind of keep you all abreast of what God is doing.
[time=571] A lot has transpired in this last year, and I wanted him to take just a few minutes and catch you all up with what that looks like.
[time=579] So, fop, catch him up, man.
[time=580] - It's always great to be with you guys at Blackhawk.
[time=582] And I do want to let you know about some of the growth that we've experienced.
[time=585] Just three months ago, I was in Los Angeles and my engineer called me and said we just had our millionth listener, which, you know, to be able to hear that, first of all, knowing that, you know, in the beginning stages, we just hope that my mom would listen.
[time=598] It was a big, big deal to me that God has used this in 94 countries to reach all these teenagers from around the world.
[time=605] I want to let you know about that.
[time=606] I want to let you also know that God's been doing some real things.
[time=608] Good and neat things.
[time=609] I haven't told you this yet, Kel.
[time=610] I have spoken at Snyder High School over 20 times this year on issues that we cover in our Bible, that we cover on the air, but, of course, doing our best to help kids where they're at, dealing with some of the mainstream media issues that they experience.
[time=623] We've been embraced only by the public school system, but by the local church as a way that we can help you online.
[time=629] Now, if you don't know what Remedy FM is, we are an online web station.
[time=633] We started out as a radio station playing music, but we've evolved so quickly into something that broadcasts live video.
[time=639] I do a lot of teaching shows that are biblically based.
[time=642] We have a lot of chat conversations.
[time=643] Any one time we could be talking to 30 to 50 kids from, again, all around the world about whatever issues they're dealing with, almost like an online chat confessional of being able to meet them where they're at.
[time=654] This morning, I want to let you know, again, about our cure Bible.
[time=657] We are so proud of the way that this thing has come together and how God has used it.
[time=661] Every listener who calls in is looking for hope and does not know who God is.
[time=665] We get them this cure Bible.
[time=666] We send it to them.
[time=667] It's the cheapest Bible I've ever found.
[time=669] It's a $5 Bible.
[time=671] It's the entire Old Testament New Testament.
[time=673] 52 relevant devotionals for what teens are going through.
[time=676] Recently, we met a young man on Xbox Live, one of our DJs does ministry on Xbox Live, and he was talking to this kid, and this kid said, "You know, he'd never heard about who Jesus Christ was." And we sent him this cure Bible.
[time=688] Well, his mom found out that we'd sent this thing to him, and she was a little bit upset.
[time=692] She called us, and she said, "You know, what is this thing you sent my son?" And we said, "Well, this is our very own teen Bible." We wrote it for the kid who just doesn't know anything about God that is interested.
[time=704] And there was a pause, and she said, "Will you send me one?" And so we sent it to her immediately.
[time=709] And, gang, I can tell you that this thing has been all over the world already.
[time=712] Kids in Germany, Australia, South Africa are reading the cure Bible because of the relationship that we have with them online where they're spending their time.
[time=721] And I can't say enough about this church.
[time=723] We just love Blackhawk and your support.
[time=725] We need your prayers as we grow.
[time=728] We're going to point an hour.
[time=729] We just need volunteers to be online chatting with us.
[time=731] We need prayer partners that are going to protect our DJs.
[time=733] Many of our DJs are Blackhawkers.
[time=735] And we just need you to be praying for our staff as we go online.
[time=739] We talk about the edgiest of issues to get these kids to a place where they understand the remedy is Jesus Christ.
[time=744] We have this Bible available.
[time=746] We sold a lot the first hour, so I can't guarantee there's much left.
[time=749] But we do have them in our booth, and we are willing to sell these online as well.
[time=752] If you have a teenager who needs to see the Word of God in an irrelevant way, meeting them where they're at.
[time=757] But, Kelly, thanks so much for your friendship, your partnership, and for all of you out there that support remedy FM, whether it be financially or perfully, we couldn't do this without you.
[time=766] Okay, help a literate computer like dummy.
[time=769] How can a guy be playing Xbox Live is a video game?
[time=772] It's a gaming console.
[time=774] It's a gaming console, and are you able to communicate with the kids while they're playing?
[time=778] We have some technology that allows them to actually listen on Xbox Live, but this isn't how the situation happened.
[time=783] One of our DJs, our hip-hop ambassador, actually goes on every week and plays kids from around the world.
[time=789] One of the kids, he's managed to get to know.
[time=791] And through that, in one hand, he's shooting them with a hand he's telling Bo Jesus.
[time=796] It's quite a dichotomy, but we are so grateful that way that God has allowed us to use technology
[time=803] to be 10 years ahead of the curve in reaching kids for Christ.
[time=806] Hey, Black Hawk, thank Clinton for all that they're doing.
[time=808] Thank you.
[time=809] Good job.
[time=814] Hey, kids, young people in the room, and boy, mom and dad's as well.
[time=819] Just go home today, this week, we think about it, and you've never been online there.
[time=823] Think about it this week.
[time=824] When you're going on your computer, remedy.fm, give it a look and be introduced to some great things
[time=830] and some great people.
[time=832] We're really thankful.
[time=833] Hey, let me, let me, if I can, just, can we just take a minute?
[time=839] And most of the time, there isn't a beginning to a Sunday morning teaching time like this,
[time=848] where I don't, I don't sense this.
[time=851] Sometimes I do what I'm about to do, and sometimes I don't, and I just entrust it to the Lord,
[time=858] which is fine, but this morning I just kind of feel like we should do this.
[time=861] I don't know where your week has taken you.
[time=866] I'm not sure what you're going through this morning.
[time=870] Not sure what condition you're in as you come and gather here this morning with the family.
[time=877] You may be incredibly encouraged.
[time=880] You may be extremely discouraged.
[time=884] You may be here today on the top of victory and good choices and situations that continue
[time=894] to look and smell like spring.
[time=897] If you were with us last week, you'll understand that reference.
[time=902] But for others of you, you know what, the wind may, the wind may just be blowing harder,
[time=909] and the skies may just seem a little darker.
[time=912] And one thing that we believe here is that no matter where you are in that,
[time=918] no matter what you're facing, no matter what the condition of your soul or life,
[time=924] the Word of God and the Spirit of God breaks through.
[time=930] And what a privilege we have to be together this morning and to have the Word of God and the Spirit of God and the encouragement that comes from the people of God.
[time=938] Minister to us, amen?
[time=940] So can I just say a prayer, and can we just jump in to our talk this morning?
[time=945] God, we pause really to say thank you for your presence.
[time=949] Oh, God, we love your presence.
[time=953] We love when we sense that you are near.
[time=956] God, we love when we sense the great power of your Word.
[time=960] God, we love it when we sense and know the great power of fellowship and the relationship, God, that you have given us with you and with each other.
[time=968] And God, we give this time to you.
[time=970] We pray, God, that you would use it to encourage us, to teach us, to remind us.
[time=976] God, to point us toward that, which is true.
[time=978] God, we pray that you would use this time to embolden us.
[time=982] God, to envision us and to give us courage to be obedient followers of your Son.
[time=988] And we ask it all in His name.
[time=990] And the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=993] Amen, thanks for letting me do that.
[time=996] Let me ask you a question this morning.
[time=998] You ever come to the realization, I'm asking all of you.
[time=1001] You ever come to the realization that if the people in your life could understand if they could just better understand this about you?
[time=1013] Then they'd understand better why you do that.
[time=1019] You ever been there?
[time=1020] You ever just realized, you know what, if the people in my life just had a clearer picture
[time=1026] of me and who I am and how I was raised and where I've been and the story of my journey,
[time=1033] if people just kind of understood this and maybe a lot of them don't.
[time=1037] If we had a better view of this, if you ever realized, folks would probably have a better clearer view of why it is.
[time=1044] You think this way or get excited about these things or are stirred by these kinds of encounters
[time=1051] and endeavors.
[time=1052] Make sense?
[time=1053] Well, I know in my own life, there's been something that in recent weeks I've been sharing with
[time=1060] you.
[time=1061] Often it is a statement that has just kind of been born out of my own time with God, my
[time=1067] own time in His Word, my own experience of life and ministry over the years.
[time=1072] I've been sharing that statement with you intermittently over these last several months.
[time=1077] And there are two things over here that I want to just make sure you understand and know
[time=1088] about me clearly today, two things that as it relates to this statement I think are very,
[time=1096] very pertinent and very, very important.
[time=1098] And I think really explain why it is my soul and my heart are so stirred when I think about
[time=1105] this statement and its truth.
[time=1109] The statement goes like this and I could just say it to you.
[time=1112] I don't even have to read it, but here it is.
[time=1115] I'm thankful in my life to be a part of as I am here in this family.
[time=1119] I'm thankful to be a part of a diverse community of disciples, Jesus imitators, who is personal
[time=1129] and cultural and financial differences disappear and their genuine love for God, their genuine
[time=1136] love for each other, their genuine love for their neighbor.
[time=1141] A diverse community of disciples, Jesus imitators whose differences disappear in their genuine
[time=1148] love for God each other and their neighbor.
[time=1151] And you may ask the question, I know sometimes I sit back and ask the question, what is it about that statement that is so encouraging to me?
[time=1160] Why?
[time=1161] Every time I read it, why?
[time=1165] Every time I scribble it on a yellow piece of paper in my office, does it just light me up?
[time=1171] At the deepest part of who I am, I read something like that and my soul and my heart and my
[time=1177] heart and my mind are stirred.
[time=1181] Why does it seem so right to me?
[time=1185] Why so inviting?
[time=1186] Why so compelling?
[time=1189] People ask me, why do you believe so strongly that this statement, that this picture is who
[time=1195] we should continue to become?
[time=1198] Well, there's two things that I want you to see over here that I think really explain the
[time=1205] question with which I read and hold on to and have given myself to a statement of that nature.
[time=1215] The first thing, I think first and foremost, I'm drawn to a diverse and inclusive picture
[time=1222] of the church, if you will.
[time=1224] I think first and foremost, I'm drawn to that statement because I believe it's biblical.
[time=1229] You can write that down.
[time=1232] The first thing I want to have you look with me at this morning and the first thing I want us to consider when you think about and look at that statement, I think I'm so drawn to
[time=1242] it, I think it ignites things in my heart and soul because I believe it's biblical.
[time=1247] Let me show you what I mean.
[time=1250] A diverse community, the church, go to Acts chapter 2, if you will.
[time=1258] Turn your Bibles to Acts chapter 2, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and then comes the book
[time=1264] of Acts.
[time=1265] If you go to Acts 2, I want to pick it up right there in verse 1.
[time=1271] Acts chapter 2 verses 1 to 6, an amazing event about to happen.
[time=1275] That's right, the church, my friends, as we know it, the New Testament age is about to
[time=1281] begin in God's sovereignty and in God's providence in this time and place, in this setting, God
[time=1290] now is about to birth the church.
[time=1293] I want you to follow along with me here.
[time=1296] When the day of Pentecost had come, Pentecost means 50th, it refers to the Feast of Weeks
[time=1302] from Exodus 34, which was celebrated 50 days after Passover, 50 days after Passover, they
[time=1310] called it Pentecost, when the day of Pentecost had come, they were, they were all together
[time=1316] in one place.
[time=1317] They, referring to the followers of Jesus, this band of faithful disciples who had experienced
[time=1324] his crucifixion, had witnessed his resurrection and ascension, and now they're waiting for what's next.
[time=1330] They were all together in one place, and suddenly, verse 2, there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting, and there
[time=1341] appeared to them tongues as a fire, distributing themselves and they, those tongues of fire,
[time=1349] rested on each one of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to
[time=1355] speak with other tongues or languages as the Spirit was giving them utterance.
[time=1363] Why?
[time=1364] Why was this going on?
[time=1365] Well, I'll keep reading.
[time=1366] Now there were, verse 5, now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men, this is the
[time=1372] context God chooses to use as he goes forward here in Acts 2 with the birth of the church.
[time=1380] There were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.
[time=1387] And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak, each one of those in the crowd was hearing those who
[time=1398] had been in the room speak in his own language, the language of the crowd, and what languages
[time=1406] were these?
[time=1407] Well, it's amazing that at this unique time, Passover, in this unique place, Jerusalem,
[time=1417] God chooses to move, he initiates the church, and as the church is birth, God wasn't about
[time=1424] to isolate.
[time=1425] He could have, but he didn't.
[time=1427] He wasn't about to segregate, he wasn't about to separate, no, God chooses to birth this thing in the midst of a context where look, look who was there.
[time=1436] Go to verse 9, who was in the mix as God begins to move Parthians and Medes and Elamites
[time=1442] and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia and Pontius and Asia.
[time=1448] People from Phrygia and Pamphylia in Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors
[time=1454] from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs.
[time=1461] So he brings them all together.
[time=1464] And from the get-go, from the inception, the church is culturally and personally, ethnically,
[time=1473] geographically diverse.
[time=1475] John MacArthur, not only probably the greatest Bible teacher of our day, but a man who invested
[time=1483] much in me early in my ministry days, John MacArthur notes in his notes on Acts 2.
[time=1490] This event showed that from then on God's people would come from all nations and mark
[time=1497] the transition from Israel to the church, a church that would now be comprised of every
[time=1503] tongue, every tribe and every nation.
[time=1508] This spirit, my friends, this spirit of inclusion, this spirit of diversity, this spirit of every
[time=1518] tribe, every tongue, every nation, this spirit of all people, having this opportunity to
[time=1526] come and to hear, to come and respond, to come and in their response and repentance be given the privilege of a place and the family of God, this spirit of diversity is all over the gospels and the book of Acts and the epistles.
[time=1539] Look at Acts 2.45.
[time=1542] Look at Acts 2.45, you see this spirit beginning to pour out.
[time=1548] It says in 2.45, it says, "And they began early believers here in this first church, began selling their property here." We see financial, socioeconomic diversity, they began selling their property and possessions
[time=1561] and we're sharing them with all as anyone might have need.
[time=1566] In chapter 4, verse 32, "And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and
[time=1572] soul, different but of one heart and soul.
[time=1576] And not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them and with great power the apostles were getting testimony to the resurrection of the Lord, Jesus an abundant grace was upon them all for there
[time=1590] was not a needy, verse 34, there was not a needy person among them."
[time=1596] Think about that.
[time=1597] Think about there not being a needy person among us.
[time=1604] For all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales and lay them at the apostles' feet and they would be distributed to each
[time=1617] as any had need.
[time=1622] Diversity, you had the poor and the wealthy, you had the needy and the gracious.
[time=1626] You can go on and read in Acts 11.
[time=1629] It's an amazing story when you begin to see what God did through the church at Antioch.
[time=1634] It was there really later on in the story of the church and its development in Antioch where we see the gospel truly beginning to go on beyond the Jews to the Gentiles.
[time=1645] There couldn't have been a more distinct, there couldn't have been a drastically different culture than the Jews, than the Gentiles.
[time=1653] We've talked about that in the past, the differences are marked and drastic and yet God moves on
[time=1659] beyond Israel, moves on beyond the Jews to a completely different tribe and tongue we
[time=1665] see from Antioch in Acts 11, the gospel going out to the Gentile world.
[time=1670] We see Philip sharing with the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8, we see Jesus ministering to the
[time=1677] Samaritan woman in John 4, Jews didn't talk to, Jewish rabbis didn't talk to women, Jewish
[time=1686] rabbis certainly didn't talk to Samaritan women, we see Jesus in that story going out of his way really, even geographically in terms of his journey to get to that well, to talk to that woman.
[time=1697] Just thinking about it this week, we see Jesus as he selects disciples, did he select 12
[time=1703] guys who were all the same, yes or no, no.
[time=1708] When we think about the gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed to the church, do we see everybody in the church getting the same gift, yes or no, no, we see diversity, we see variety,
[time=1719] we see in God's design for this thing from the very beginning that it would be at its
[time=1726] best when it was functioning with the understanding that you're going to do some things differently than I'm going to do and you may look different than me and you may come from a different place and you may speak a different language and you may have different abilities but in
[time=1741] him we are one.
[time=1742] I love how Paul summarizes this in Galatians 3, turn there would you, Galatians 3, 26.
[time=1753] Go past Romans and 1 and 2 Corinthians and before Ephesians you'll come to Galatians, look at Galatians 3, 26.
[time=1760] He says this so well, so powerfully, Galatians 3, 26.
[time=1766] For you, riding to the church at Galatia for you are all sons of God, stop there, is everybody
[time=1774] in the world a son of God, no, be careful there.
[time=1778] He says for you are all sons of God through faith in whom?
[time=1784] Let's say that louder.
[time=1785] Through faith in whom? Through faith in Christ we're all one.
[time=1794] That's just a really profound statement right there, it's for everybody here and this is written for we're all one, through faith in who?
[time=1806] Say it again, Christ.
[time=1809] For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ, what a
[time=1816] great picture you've put him on.
[time=1819] There is neither in that case, those of you who have had faith in Christ, those of you who have been baptized into Christ, there is neither with you all, there is neither Jew nor Greek and again I can't in the time allowed today even begin to describe to you the difference
[time=1837] in that culture in this context between those two words Jew and Greek.
[time=1844] I mean pick the most hostile, violent, separated demographic group of people that you and I
[time=1852] know of in our modern day and just multiply it.
[time=1857] So far apart those people were and yet he says here through Christ there's neither, there's
[time=1864] neither, it's all brought together, there's neither Jew nor Greek, there's neither slave nor free man, there's neither male nor female for you are all, say it out loud, one in Christ
[time=1877] Jesus.
[time=1878] And if you belong to Christ then you are Abraham's descendants heirs according to promise.
[time=1888] What a great picture, what a great picture of the diversity of the body of Christ.
[time=1897] Now I've been talking to you about and we've been kind of camping on this issue for several
[time=1904] months and I'm really grateful for some of the questions that it has raised so thankful
[time=1910] for some of the discussions that it's allowed me and others on our team to have.
[time=1915] And while I've been talking about it and while I believe so deeply in it and I've just tried to in a few minutes, number one from God's words show you why I'm so moved by that concept.
[time=1928] I want to make sure as I talk about that I want to make sure as we continue to move forward that you understand what I mean by it and I just tried to do that for you there real
[time=1938] quick.
[time=1939] I also want to make sure you understand what I don't mean because I think sometimes when you talk about something a lot people may begin to think there's a strategy kind of
[time=1950] going on or there's plans behind the scenes or there's something brewing and I really
[time=1957] want to make sure that you understand just a couple of things on that front this morning.
[time=1962] What I don't mean is I talk to you a lot about the beauty of diversity and the inclusiveness
[time=1968] of the church that God designed what I don't mean is I am not talking about an effort on our part to somehow manufacture diversity.
[time=1980] Not talking about a recruiting effort because we are stirred by this and because we long
[time=1987] for this.
[time=1988] I'm not talking about an effort on our part to somehow go out and fill seats with different
[time=1994] colored people from different parts of the world and it's not we're not talking about
[time=2000] some plan here to try and humanly speaking make progress on some quota or goal not at
[time=2008] all.
[time=2010] When I talk about this we're not talking about recruiting it we're talking about being open to who God would bring who God would bring across your path who God would bring
[time=2022] to our neighborhood who God would bring to this community the opportunities that God would in his sovereignty and providence allow this family to have and that picture is an
[time=2034] ever changing picture who God brought and the opportunities God gave this family 25 years
[time=2040] ago it's a different picture today and we're really thankful for that and we want to be
[time=2046] a family that's open to God's design for Jew and Greek slave and free man and woman those
[time=2055] who are different to hear the life changing life transforming word of God and respond
[time=2062] to the call of God on their hearts and in so responding have the privilege of being part
[time=2068] of the family.
[time=2069] Don't forget and I wrote this down I wanted to make sure I say it right to you this morning don't forget this and a friend of mine pointed this out to me reminded me of this this week meaningful diversity if we're going to talk about ethnic and cultural or financial diversity
[time=2087] within a healthy functioning body meaningful diversity within a local body is a byproduct
[time=2094] not a goal it's a byproduct you don't want to try at a foundational level to be diverse
[time=2102] you want to try at a foundational level to be like Jesus does that make sense you don't
[time=2112] want to try to manufacture something you want to try and be somebody you want to be like
[time=2119] Jesus was you want to be like those gracious generous acts to acts for believers who sold
[time=2130] what they had so that those who didn't have could live and survive you want to be like Jesus and those that followed after him we want to be disciples and Jesus was and those
[time=2142] that followed him early on they were a loving gracious people who in the world God put them
[time=2149] in saw no distinctions and allowed God to work through that heart and that mind you know
[time=2158] it really has raised this discussion really has raised some very I think very important
[time=2167] and very pertinent opportunities for me in my own heart and mind to think some things
[time=2173] through and I think for a few others of us to think some things right I had a very at
[time=2179] a very healthy and I mean that is a very healthy conversation a couple weeks ago it wasn't
[time=2187] a note it wasn't an email it was face to face and it was with somebody who I love and respect
[time=2193] who's a part of our family who just said to me look as you talk about diversity I just got to tell you there's some questions that come up in my mind and I need to ask you and I want you to be honest with me and I promised him but I would be and so he just said look when you use the word diversity this word diversity while he says I think I know what
[time=2213] you mean and I think I know where you're coming from understand this word diversity is oftentimes used today in this in this broader discussion of inclusion and tolerance not
[time=2228] your head if you're following me all right so he says to me he says so I just I got to ask you he said when you talk about being diverse he says are you talking about being
[time=2239] inclusive and are you talking about being tolerant I said yeah I think so I'm pretty
[time=2249] sure that's what I'm meaning and he said well let me just take it a step further because you know oftentimes that word diversity when included in the conversation of tolerance
[time=2258] and inclusiveness then we start getting into issues like and he could have picked any but he said homosexuality are you Kelly are you saying that we want to be a community that's
[time=2274] open and inclusive and accepting when it comes to things like that and I said well that's
[time=2287] a great question think about that I said let's let's define and bear with me here I said
[time=2299] let's define homosexual if by homosexual what you're asking me is do I think that there's
[time=2308] a place in the family of God because where the statement was a diverse community of disciples
[time=2314] I said if you're asking me do I think there's room in the community of disciples Christ
[time=2320] followers for one who would in this case you picked that topic kind of wave their fist
[time=2326] in the face of God and say don't tell me that I'm wrong don't tell me how to live don't try to dictate my morality I am who I am and I'll do what I want to do if you're asking
[time=2339] me am I saying we're accepting of that and that's all good and there's room for that in the family of God no I'm not saying that I think the word of God's really clear that
[time=2354] whether it's that issue or any other number of issues that when one comes to faith in Christ
[time=2361] and fully surrenders their heart and life to Christ their heart is softened repentance
[time=2367] takes place and that individual begins to move in a direction toward that which is right and true and good they don't move perfectly they don't move immediately all the time but
[time=2379] yet that heart and that disposition is changed and what we see there is a person who is growing
[time=2386] toward obedience and greater trust in Christ I say that okay all right I said but I was
[time=2396] if you're asking me not so much about the family of God but let's just talk about the
[time=2404] gathering or the relational world of the people of God then I'd have a different answer
[time=2413] for you and I said to him I would say to you that if we're talking about somebody walking
[time=2419] through these doors fist not flying in the face of God but someone saying hey you know what I got some questions and in all honesty I'm not sure about what's going on inside
[time=2431] of me and my tendencies and my patterns and my choices for talking about somebody coming
[time=2437] through these doors and sitting down wanting to listen and understand better what may be
[time=2444] this book and its author has to offer them for talking about somebody who might want to
[time=2450] do that with you or me over coffee someday my answer to him was I am absolutely saying
[time=2458] that I would welcome I would include I would go to great lengths to try and be a safe place
[time=2467] to hear a dangerous life changing message and I said further further why wouldn't we
[time=2475] be accepting and willing to offer that when we're willing and accepting I said to him I'm
[time=2482] willing for you to be there and I'm willing for me to be there and we're willing every
[time=2490] week to have over eaters and over spenders and over gossipers and over prideful and over
[time=2503] critical and over lazy I mean just go sin after sin after sin after sin we just go right
[time=2511] down the list and every week God gives us the privilege to welcome those who struggle
[time=2518] in the midst of their humanness to come in through those doors and hear the truth and so
[time=2525] I want to make sure you understand when we talk about diversity and inclusiveness in
[time=2531] the family of God that's really clear how God just defines that when it comes to the opportunity
[time=2540] to reach out to red yellow black and white educated uneducated those who look like you
[time=2548] and those who don't those who act like you and those who don't those who believe what I believe and those who don't when it comes to the privilege God's given us to be the people of God in a community filled with diversity I'm hopeful and thankful that we get a chance
[time=2564] to move and act and offer in that kind of spirit amen amen all right well there's anything
[time=2578] I got to bear with me here okay because I want to I started with the member back to my question have you ever realized if folks knew something about you that if they knew that they'd better understand this well first of all I just want you to understand I love God's word and I believe God's word speaks to that statement in such powerful ways it's why first and foremost I said it stirs me secondly and I don't hardly ever do this but
[time=2602] I'm going to take I'm going to take a few extra minutes here and I'm going to do something I rarely ever do and that is talk about me and I don't talk about me often but I want
[time=2613] you to understand that for me I think there's something I've learned about me and where God has brought me my life my journey with him the way he orchestrated all of that I'm
[time=2624] learning that there's some there's some things about me that really play into why certain
[time=2630] things like that statement stir me so deeply and in such a profound way so let me just
[time=2637] you bear with me yeah we let me just tell you a few things about me that I think play into this some of these things you know a bunch of this stuff I think you may not know only child most of you know that never had any brothers or sisters two words kind of
[time=2654] explain that 12 pounds 10 ounces 17 homes by the time I turned 18 17 homes and I think
[time=2669] 11 different cities as far as siblings go I had no you know no siblings so I had no
[time=2677] friends in terms of inside the home and every new city we went to every new neighborhood we moved into every new school I went to meant that I had to from kindergarten on I had
[time=2688] to develop this ability to adapt so I learned from experience how to adapt a lot of my growing
[time=2697] up years we were all over the place many of those years spending California just the mention of the word says a lot to anybody who knows California when you grow up in California
[time=2707] you grow up with everything and every one at your fingertips one of the places that we lived in California was a small little town in the middle of the Mojave Desert this is
[time=2718] true I lived in the desert in a little place called needles California oftentimes Curtis
[time=2725] Smith would tell you it's the hottest place in the country day after day after day between
[time=2732] like you know June and September I lived in needles California as a 10 year old my friends
[time=2738] were Hispanic and Native American Indians I learned to love Mexican food and survived the heat with Joey Calderon and Matthew Wingfoot these were my buddies this was who I lived
[time=2750] with and through rocks with and hunted lizards with I was a lizard hunter extraordinaire it
[time=2758] was in California that I also spent some early and formidable days with my alcoholic deaf grandpa you've heard me talk to him refer to him many times over the years grandpa Joe with him I learned to love him I learned to love the disabled I learned to love the
[time=2775] addicted and see more clearly even as a young boy they're pain and struggle I learned to
[time=2782] be at ease with him in the midst of his lifelong battle when I was five or six most of you
[time=2790] don't know this and this just kind of came to me in the last couple months as I've been thinking about this when I was five six years old for a brief stint my parents ran a nursing home you didn't know that did you my parents ran a nursing home in Santa Cruz California
[time=2805] on the coast run on the beach and and we lived in the back of the nursing home and I would
[time=2811] literally as a five six year old boy I would literally walk the halls of the nursing home every day playing with 90 year olds on oxygen these were my friends and every day I'd have
[time=2823] to like reintroduce myself to them I didn't quite understand that at five I would think they would have remembered me but they didn't but there I was five years old playing with 90 year olds every day in a nursing home in Santa Cruz California we moved later at the
[time=2838] age of twelve to Louisiana that's right Louisiana it was there in Shreveport Louisiana twelve
[time=2846] years of age but I first met racism and ongoing segregation 1975 I learned quickly about southern
[time=2859] culture and that there was an entirely different culture of kids and people on the other side
[time=2865] literally on the other side of the tracks and while I was told by whites to stay on my
[time=2871] side I chose almost daily to ride my bike with my basketball in hand to the other side
[time=2878] over to Townsend Street Park where I met and became friends with Monroe Doyle Jimmy and
[time=2885] Lamonde can remember him like it was yesterday for some reason in the midst of all of that
[time=2891] and the way God had raised me to that point and those three years in Shreveport black never seemed different to me it just never did and poor poor to me the closer I got to
[time=2905] it and the more I was around it seemed less complicated it seems simpler those three years
[time=2914] were some of the most memorable of my life I went on to high school we moved from Louisiana back to California I went to Saratoga high school in Saratoga California where the socioeconomic
[time=2925] demographic represents the top two percent of the nation's highest incomes the kids at
[time=2931] my high school what does that mean it means that the kids at my high school drove pourshes BMW's and corvettes and the only ones who didn't were those who hadn't turned sixteen
[time=2942] yet and me that was it and that's not an exaggeration my friend's dad's were millionaires and I learned
[time=2953] to get along with those who had much and developed an appreciation for the discipline sacrifice and hard work that many of them had endured on the way to their fortunes I went to college
[time=2965] this may make more sense to some than for others but let me just try and help you with this I went to college in San Francisco Fresno and Los Angeles which would mean if you just
[time=2978] kind of follow the demographics of those places San Francisco the metropolitan of the city and all that comes with San Francisco Fresno really the agricultural capital of the United States really in the San Joaquin Valley there and then LA in those three places I roomed with drug dealers future farmers and future pastors over those five years I learned how
[time=3001] to roll a joint bail hay and exegied a New Testament text and once I fully surrendered
[time=3009] my heart and life to Christ in 1983 I did ministry in Tijuana Mexico New York City the
[time=3015] inner city and suburbs of Los Angeles Fort Wayne and Irobi Kenya Yvonne of O Russia I
[time=3025] have lived my entire life with red and yellow black brown and white I've embraced and been
[time=3034] at ease with old and young the physically elite and the physically impaired I've lived
[time=3042] in the desert I've lived at the beach I've lived in the mountains and in the frozen tundra
[time=3048] of Fort Wayne Indiana and this is going to really blow your mind I like I really like

[time=3237] so much to me and I'm so thankful I get to experience this in a growing sense with you
[time=3246] I'm pretty sure in light of all that that I want to be a part of a church that looks like heaven I long to be a part of a local church that is comprised of what Dr. MacArthur
[time=3258] used to always refer to as a celestial demographic and what's a celestial demographic well he
[time=3268] would always say who's gonna be in heaven every tongue every tribe every nation anybody drug
[time=3282] addicts and porn addicts and homosexuals and liars and cheats and lusters and overspenders
[time=3290] and mean critical lazy and dignity people who got changed who got redeemed and thank
[time=3302] God for places like this and thank God for people like you who allow those people to feel welcomed thank God for places and people like you who reach out and are willing to embrace
[time=3314] even though it might be difficult and challenging so that they can hear the life changing eternity
[time=3320] altering truth of God's word amen thank God that we get to be a community of believers a diverse community of disciples not consumers not attenders disciples Jesus imitators whose
[time=3337] differences and we've got many disappear in a greater broader bigger cause than your preferences
[time=3349] or mine a disappear in light of our love for him our love for each other and our love
[time=3357] for our neighbor those who are different both sides of the tracks amen stand if you would
[time=3368] let me pray for us this morning father God we are grateful that we can laugh and have
[time=3376] a little bit of fun but we're grateful more so than that God that we can focus our hearts and our minds on the great truth of your word and God as we see you beginning the church and as we watch its inception and its growth we see how in time it reached across all boundaries
[time=3393] and all lines and all distinctions and God as Paul said in Galatians 3 it still does today and we are all of us through faith in Christ one and so God we will commit again
[time=3404] today to be a people that aren't strategizing or recruiting or trying to make something
[time=3413] happen but God will commit again to be a people all of us who are open open and willing
[time=3420] and ready to extend a hand of kindness and warmth God a people who are willing to invite
[time=3426] God a people who are willing no matter the color of skin no matter the history of ones passed no matter the difficulty that may be represented in that extended hand oh God
[time=3439] will push through with your help and your strength and your encouragement so that whether
[time=3446] slave or free Jew or Greek male or female gay or straight black or white no matter the
[time=3457] differences God we will attempt to be a people who will provide a place and a setting where
[time=3464] you can and your word and your spirit can transform people into the body of Christ and
[time=3473] for that God we are grateful thanks for letting us be a part of that keep our hearts open
[time=3480] and our hands and arms extended and all the people agreed with the prayer and said amen
[time=3510] .
