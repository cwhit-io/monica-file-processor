[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well good morning everybody.
[time=33] It's good to see all of you.
[time=35] There's a joke floating around the foyer this morning.
[time=39] A couple guys pulled me aside to tell me the joke.
[time=42] They found it pretty funny.
[time=44] I wasn't terribly amused.
[time=46] The joke goes something like this.
[time=47] There's a guest speaker this morning, did you hear?
[time=49] And they go, "Who?" and they say, "Kelly." (audience laughs) So anyway, it is good to be back with you.
[time=58] And yeah, it's been a very, I've told you before, how thankful I am for the freedom you give me with my family mostly over the summer months to be with them in different settings.
[time=68] So anyway, summer's over and here we are and it's good to see all of you and great to be back with you.
[time=72] I don't know how long ago this movie came out.
[time=75] I can't remember.
[time=77] And when it came out and even the title of the movies, believe me, not important.
[time=83] But as I describe it, I think many of you will probably remember it.
[time=89] It was a movie that had a lot of different kind of subplots to it, but the main deal was between Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger.
[time=99] And they had this stormy relationship and it was on and it was off and I think he was a sports agent or something.
[time=108] But anyway, this relationship kind of just went up and down all over the place.
[time=112] And it looked okay at the beginning and then in classic Hollywood fashion, it was bleak in the middle.
[time=118] And then at the end of the movie, all of a sudden, the music starts, you know, and the whole plot crescendos with them face to face, I think, in a living room.
[time=128] And he gives this amazing speech trying to win her back and at the end of the speech with tears in old Tommy's eyes.
[time=138] He looks at her and he says, you...
[time=142] Anybody want to tell me what he said?
[time=145] Oh, you all watched it.
[time=147] You complete me.
[time=152] And then she says something like, shut up, you had me at hello and kind of a funny little moment there.
[time=157] But he says this, you complete me.
[time=163] And I want to stand here this morning with you, church, and I want to just remind you, we as a leadership want to take some time this morning to remind you, that while I understand the romanticized intent of that line,
[time=179] and while I understand it's a movie and while I understand how that thing kind of ended up there, I want to just, you know, go on record again as saying that that thought, that notion that she would have the capacity and ability to complete him, complete, fill him up, bring everything that's needed, somehow make him all that he needed to be is patently alive.
[time=209] It's just not true.
[time=211] It's a movie.
[time=215] And I want to remind you, couples in the room.
[time=219] I just want to remind you in the room who are married.
[time=223] You may be having some struggles today.
[time=226] Maybe you had some last night.
[time=228] Maybe it's been a tough few months.
[time=235] And I just want to remind you as couples in light of God's design, in light of what God has intended.
[time=243] I want to remind you, he or she, sit next to you there, was never, ever, ever designed by God to complete you.
[time=253] Do we understand this?
[time=256] It's never how it was intended to be.
[time=258] He or she doesn't have the capacity to complete you.
[time=260] He or she doesn't have the ability.
[time=262] He or she has no ability whatsoever to make you all that you were intended to be and fill you up.
[time=270] And when you as a couple treat each other that way and look to each other for that completion, it doesn't work.
[time=279] You may be sitting here this morning thinking about getting married someday.
[time=283] And I want to remind you if you're thinking about it and you kind of know who that guy is or you know who that girl is and you guys are moving down that road and you're thinking to yourself, boy, when we get married, this is going to be it.
[time=292] I'm going to be complete.
[time=294] No.
[time=295] No, he won't.
[time=297] She won't.
[time=299] It is not how God designed for you and I to be completed.
[time=304] My friends, church, God designed you and I to be completed
[time=311] by Christ.
[time=315] Amen?
[time=316] Look with me at Colossians 128, a foundational verse in the life of our church, a foundational verse in the life of this ministry.
[time=326] It is at the core, my friends, of what we are trying our best with God's help to do and to be for you and with you.
[time=335] Paul writes the church at Colossae in Colossians 128.
[time=340] He says, "We, you want to know what we're about?
[time=342] You want to know what we do?
[time=343] You want to know without the very core of this ministry.
[time=346] You want to know what's most important, what's most important about what we're doing there with you, Colossae Church.
[time=353] Black talk, the most important thing we could ever do for you.
[time=358] Paul says, "We proclaim, say it, him.
[time=364] We proclaim him.
[time=366] We proclaim the gospel.
[time=368] We proclaim the truth about Christ.
[time=371] We proclaim him and who he is and what he's done and what that's provided and what that means for you, that whole picture.
[time=381] We proclaim him." He goes on in 28 to say admonishing in this proclaiming of the gospel, in this proclaiming of Jesus.
[time=394] We admonish every man and we teach every man.
[time=399] With all wisdom, James says that wisdom comes from where?
[time=402] That wisdom comes from above.
[time=404] We admonish and we teach with all wisdom.
[time=406] And here's why, so that at the end of the day and these are the kinds of verses and these are the kinds of phrases that really reach deep into the heart of men and women like me who before God feel every day like I do the responsibility, appropriately so,
[time=425] of all of you.
[time=429] So that, we do all that.
[time=432] So that at the end of the day, we may, because God will call for
[time=438] this, from those who lead and love and teach so that we may, at the end of the day, present every man, say it out loud, complete.
[time=451] And you will become, that's a great word, they're complete in the NASB.
[time=456] When you look it up in the Greek, when you look it up in the Greek, it means to be like who?
[time=460] To be like Jesus.
[time=462] That's why we proclaim him and his gospel.
[time=467] Well, so we looked at this, we've looked at this for years, we looked at it again in recent days.
[time=473] And as a leadership, you know, in that room we gather in where we sit and talk with each other and go before God, we ask the question, very important question, I think.
[time=482] We said, who's the most completed person who's ever lived?
[time=485] I mean, if this is really at the end of the day, what we're hoping for, if this is really at the end of the day, what we're wanting to be able to provide this family and this, this ministry that you would be complete, not because of who you marry, but because of who you surrendered your heart and life to.
[time=499] We've asked ourselves, who was the most completed person ever?
[time=505] And the answer to that question, you know, and I know, say it.
[time=508] Who isn't?
[time=509] Jesus.
[time=511] And so we felt compelled to then go to the story of Jesus.
[time=516] Because of the encouragement of a number of our elders, one in particular, John Bars, who is an elder here at Blackhawk and has been a good friend of mine for years, John was persistent in his encouragement that we look through carefully the gospels and the book of Acts with the intent to, in looking through and reading through, and we did line by line, all the gospels and the entire book of Acts, asking the question as we read, what did Jesus do?
[time=546] How did Jesus live?
[time=548] What disciplines did Jesus give Himself to?
[time=551] What did He value?
[time=553] What did He embrace?
[time=556] How did He live and how did those who followed Him live?
[time=561] What did they embrace?
[time=562] What disciplines did they give themselves to?
[time=567] And as we read through the gospels, those of us who lead and try to love you here in this family, we found that Jesus did give
[time=577] Himself to some very specific disciplines, some elemental
[time=583] pursuits, if you will, that brought great strength.
[time=587] Listen, that brought great strength and anointing and power and love and grace and effectiveness to His life.
[time=594] How would you like those things to be brought to your life?
[time=598] How would you like it if your life was marked by great strength and anointing power, love, grace and effectiveness?
[time=608] And we did our very best with God's help to capture those findings and that's what's become our five elements, these elements that you see on the screen, these five disciplines, these five spiritual endeavors, these five practices that we saw Jesus giving Himself to, and we want you to be complete.
[time=628] Complete means like Him.
[time=631] You with me, this isn't, this isn't, we tried to make this really simple, it's not that complicated, is it?
[time=637] We want you to be like Him, and so we felt God lead us to these five elements.
[time=641] You see Him right there, prayerful abiding.
[time=644] Jesus again and again and again.
[time=647] Jesus made time to be with the Father.
[time=650] Jesus made time in His day, often morning, noon and night to prayerfully and personally and intimately abide with the Father.
[time=661] And those who followed after Him in that first church did the very same thing.
[time=668] There was a huge devotion to Scripture.
[time=670] You see it all through Jesus' life, you see it all through his ministry, you see it in a profound and prominent way in that first church.
[time=679] We see Jesus in the temptations and the wilderness as He's thirsty and hungry and Satan comes and personally attacks, we see Jesus as one response.
[time=687] Again and again is the Word of God, here's the Scriptures.
[time=691] The same Word that the Psalmist calls for you and I to hide in our hearts so we will not sin against Him.
[time=699] Personal prayerful abiding, a devotion to Scripture.
[time=702] We see Jesus engaged in, we see Him modeling for those who followed Him and we see Him modeling it for you and I, transformational community.
[time=711] Jesus above all people could have lived Him being who He was.
[time=715] Of all people He could have lived in isolation.
[time=718] Of all people He could have been okay out on His own.
[time=721] Of all people He would have been fine to be distanced from the struggles and the trials that come anytime you get up close to people but no.
[time=730] Jesus models for us community.
[time=732] Jesus lived with.
[time=734] Jesus traveled with.
[time=735] Jesus ate with.
[time=736] Jesus was in conflict at times with.
[time=739] Jesus taught and loved and they slept on the roads and they administered in the temples and the synagogues and in the villages with three really closely with three with 12 and even
[time=754] with 70 and beyond that 120.
[time=759] And in that community, here's the point, they were all transformed.
[time=765] Jesus changed them and He grew them and they became different people than they were when this thing started as they lived and shared life together.
[time=775] We saw in our study prayerful abiding, we saw this huge devotion to the Word of God.
[time=780] We saw transformational community.
[time=782] We saw Jesus model, missional serving.
[time=785] And those that followed after Him, missionally served.
[time=789] You keep asking me which I'm thankful for.
[time=791] Many keep asking me, okay explain to me again.
[time=793] What does it mean when you say missional serving?
[time=795] It's real simple, but it's very profound.
[time=797] Missional serving is serving.
[time=799] Yes, it's painting a fence.
[time=801] And yes, it's raking up leaves.
[time=803] And yes, it's visiting an elderly person in a nursing home.
[time=807] And yes, it's going to Nairobi and holding babies.
[time=809] And yes, it's going to in as much and helping people figure out how to get bus tickets.
[time=815] But it's not just doing those things to do those things.
[time=817] And sometimes you and I do those things just to do those things.
[time=822] No, missional serving is doing it on mission, doing it with purpose, doing it with intent to pass along the Lord to those people, to reflect His attributes, to end the serving, in the raking of the leaves.
[time=837] Pray in hope to God you would have an opportunity to introduce that person to the one source of hope they desperately need.
[time=844] Jesus did it again and again and again.
[time=848] He was missional.
[time=849] He didn't waste time doing things that didn't matter.
[time=855] Prayerful abiding, devotion to Scripture, transformational community, missional serving.
[time=862] And then at the end of it, all He just stood there on that mountain and told those guys before He left.
[time=868] Go make some more.
[time=871] Go reproduce yourselves.
[time=873] It's what this is all about.
[time=875] Go and multiply.
[time=877] Go and take all that I've taught you, all that we've seen and experienced and invested in others making disciples.
[time=887] And today I want to say this to you.
[time=889] I want to leave that list up there on the screen.
[time=892] Today after 20, 23 years of ministry,
[time=898] what you see on that screen right there, that is all, that is all I'm interested in ever being measured by again.
[time=914] For the rest of my days, however long God allows me to do this, that right there is the singular metric that I want to be evaluated by
[time=926] as a leader and pastor, and I believe it's the singular metric
[time=932] that we as a church should assess our ministry, our church, our school,
[time=941] our broadcast, that right there on the screen.
[time=946] That's all I want to be measured by.
[time=948] And here's what I mean by that, for years and years and years.
[time=952] I grew up spiritually, and I grew up in ministry, if you will.
[time=958] I grew up in a ministry world where you were assessed by and where today even still this continues, where the metrics that are used to say, "Hey, are you doing well?
[time=970] Are you successful?" See, I've grown up in a ministry world where the metric was attendance, where the metric has been the size of our budget, the building or the physical plant, how many books I've written.
[time=985] Which I haven't written any, by the way, yet.
[time=988] I'm working on it. Thank you.
[time=992] Growing numbers in our viewing audience, style of service, how high-tech, cool, or innovative can we be.
[time=999] See, these are the things so many times that I think, if we're not careful, we can begin to want to be assessed and measured by these things, enrollment numbers.
[time=1009] How many trips we've taken to the rescue mission or Nairobi?
[time=1013] When I believe biblically, my friends, according to Scripture, we should be assessed and measured by one thing and one thing only.
[time=1020] Are we growing that?
[time=1024] Are we, by God's grace and with His help, developing in you a life that looks like that?
[time=1035] That's what we should be, that's what you should measure me by.
[time=1039] That's what you should say, you should say, well done, or you should say, not going so well.
[time=1045] Not primarily based on any of those other things, I think, primarily based on this.
[time=1051] And so, as a leadership, we went before God and we begged God to help us simplify and focus our ministry, our discipling efforts.
[time=1063] And this is the picture that He led us to, and He did.
[time=1066] This is the picture that God led, those who lead and love you.
[time=1070] This is the picture He led us to.
[time=1072] Disciples, He told us, and the Scriptures bear it out, all through the Gospels and the Book of Acts and the Epistles, disciples will be grown when you gather faithfully, when you gather to encounter God, when you connect in smaller settings to engage in growth, and when you go, when you having gathered and having connected, when you go, when you become a mobile priesthood, when you're willing to go across the street, across town, across the world, to pass Him and His attributes of love and grace and compassion along to others.
[time=1112] And you do this in ministry, you do this in your workplace, you do this as a family, when we, as a family,
[time=1123] gather, connect and go with that kind of intention and that kind of purpose, we believe God's, and we see it happening, we see God growing, disciples.
[time=1135] This morning, I want to just get you to think with me about, in our remaining time this morning, I want to just draw your attention to that one little piece over on the side there, connecting.
[time=1144] This morning, I'd like to just encourage you as a family on this connecting to engage in growth front.
[time=1151] You know how much it means, you've heard us say it, you'll hear me say it again, and again, we believe there's great value in this setting, but we believe there is enormous value in benefit, and the scriptures bear it out, how you and I are grown and deepened in our faith when we engage in those smaller settings, and it might be a class on a Sunday morning, it could be a home community, it could be a restaurant booth with three friends.
[time=1176] It could be a one-on-one discipling relationship, but beyond this, there are so many opportunities for you and I to engage in application of that truth and the growth that comes when we live and experience life together.
[time=1192] I want to tell you this morning about some Sunday morning opportunities.
[time=1195] I want to tell you, we want to tell you some stories of those who through Sunday morning opportunities and home communities and ministries here at Blackhawk, where God is taking the connecting piece
[time=1210] of that picture and doing some amazing things.
[time=1213] I don't want you to miss it, we don't want you to go without this.
[time=1217] Some of you, I affectionately refer to, and I mean that, I affectionately refer to some of you as one-hour folks, and there are others who are two-hour folks and there's reasons for certain things I understand that, but you may need to be a two-hour individual.
[time=1234] There may be an opportunity right here within these walls on a Sunday morning, and on the screens, I think they've got some of those opportunities listed, and those are all good people doing a good thing, and they're all elemental in their pursuit and growing in their commitment to be five-element-driven, and we want you to think about coming and connecting with some people.
[time=1257] Others of you are connected in smaller settings off campus during the week.
[time=1261] Those are going to continue to become more and more elemental in their pursuit wherever you go around this place.
[time=1269] In whatever setting you connect, we're just drawing bigger lines in the sand these days and saying, "You know what? Before God, it's our responsibility to complete you, spiritually build into you, and those five elements are what we want you to be about." Watch this video, I think it captures in a very cool way, in a very simple way.
[time=1289] It just captures the amazing opportunities God gives us with each other as we live out this faith in community.
[time=1297] Romans 12, 18, be at peace with one another.
[time=1305] Psalm 133-1, be unified with one another.
[time=1310] John 13-34, love one another.
[time=1314] 2 Corinthians 13-12, greet one another.
[time=1318] Romans 12-10, be devoted to one another.
[time=1322] Romans 14-19, build up one another.
[time=1326] Romans 15-14, instruct one another.
[time=1330] Romans 12-16, live in harmony, Ephesians 4-32.
[time=1335] Be compassionate toward one another.
[time=1338] 1 Thessalonians 5-11, encourage one another.
[time=1342] 1 Corinthians 12-25, have concern for one another.
[time=1348] Galatians 5-13, serve one another.
[time=1352] Ephesians 5-21, submit one another.
[time=1356] 1 Thessalonians 5-18, comfort one another.
[time=1360] Romans 15-7, accept one another.
[time=1364] 1 Thessalonians 5-15, be kind to one another.
[time=1369] Ephesians 4-32, forgive one another.
[time=1373] Colossians 3-16, admonish one another.
[time=1377] James 5-15, pray for one another.
[time=1381] Hebrews 10-24, spur one another to love and good deeds.
[time=1385] Hebrews 10-25, fellowship with one another.
[time=1389] 1 Peter 4-19, be hospitable to one another.
[time=1393] Leviticus 19-11, do not lie to one another.
[time=1396] Galatians 6-2, carry burdens for one another.
[time=1399] James 5-16, confessing to one another.
[time=1403] Colossians 3-13, bear with one another.
[time=1414] It's kind of a Brady bunch effect there at the end, did you catch that?
[time=1418] That's kind of cool.
[time=1420] Hey, we wanted to just take the rest of our time this morning and just share three stories from three smaller settings here in our ministry where people are connecting, engaging in growth, and God's encouraging them through those settings.
[time=1433] I'm thankful to have Rod and Carolyn Ovett, Vern Chauvin, and Denny Howard here with us this morning.
[time=1439] I'm going to let Rod kind of tell you about the smaller setting that they're a part of.
[time=1444] There's a Sunday morning and a Wednesday night Carolyn's going to briefly describe, and then I'm going to have Vern and Denny just share what God's been doing through these settings.
[time=1452] Rod, tell us about it.
[time=1453] Okay, thank you.
[time=1455] Excel is our class on Sunday mornings at the 9 o'clock hour, and Karen and I had the privilege of jumping into a fellowship that had begun many, many years ago, I think over 20.
[time=1466] And a lot of people have been there for a long time, but we keep gaining people.
[time=1472] What we've done is we have a lot of good fellowship, a lot of opportunity to share, a lot of extraneous activity,
[time=1478] but we've really committed ourselves to a deeper understanding of the word.
[time=1483] That's paramount in our class where maybe we're at that age, we need to know it more, I don't know.
[time=1491] But we've committed ourselves to a basically admit rash type of study.
[time=1496] Something that's deep, prospecting as it were.
[time=1500] We get into the history, the language, we dig deep, and our model was basically what happened when Israel came out of exile.
[time=1510] The sages of old and the wise men of Israel decided we're going to commit to the word,
[time=1517] to the study of the word like it said in Colossians.
[time=1520] And so we are committed to that.
[time=1522] And what they felt in Hillel, the famous rabbi, said that he believed with all his heart that the highest form of worship was the study of God's word.
[time=1532] So we're committed to that on Wednesday morning and again on Sunday morning and again on Wednesday.
[time=1538] Karen, tell me a little bit about the Wednesday night opportunity.
[time=1541] We meet on Wednesdays in the library from 645 to 8.
[time=1546] It is the same format as the Excel class and our studies run parallel.
[time=1552] For some people who come, it is a mid-week opportunity for an additional community experience,
[time=1560] meaning they attend other ABFs or even other churches.
[time=1564] But for some it is their primary community experience.
[time=1568] That's cool. Awesome. Well, Vern, I think Vern's a part of that Wednesday night community.
[time=1574] Vern, I want you just to share with the folks how God is using that community experience to encourage you.
[time=1580] And I got to give props to Vern.
[time=1582] I don't know that I'll ever be bold enough to do this, but he brought his own timer.
[time=1586] He brought his own timer.
[time=1588] Blessed is already going to stay on track and love you Vern.
[time=1591] Go ahead and hit that thing and go.
[time=1593] Thank you.
[time=1595] When I attended the meeting, well, first of all, I know you have a bulletin.
[time=1600] Will you circle Wednesday evening Bible study, someone that Carol mentioned.
[time=1605] That's the one I'm going to talk about.
[time=1607] And bear with me because in two and a half minutes, I don't think I can say what I want to say.
[time=1612] So I'm going to read it.
[time=1614] And when I attended the town hall meeting on Saturday, August 29th at Don Hall's guesthouse, they gave us a bell.
[time=1624] Well, we didn't have one here, so I made my own.
[time=1628] And so I attended Common Ground for about six years, and I've been attending Wednesday night evening for two years.
[time=1637] And I want to speak about three things.
[time=1639] One is our Bible study, and we're studying the book of Hebrews right now.
[time=1644] Our fellowship in a very diverse community where we connect, as Pastor Kelly was saying, and in our prayer time.
[time=1652] We're having an in-depth study in the book of Hebrews taught by Rod and Carol Overt in addition to providing historical and cultural background,
[time=1662] mid-resh, and all that good stuff.
[time=1666] So he introduced some Greek texts and the Greek words.
[time=1670] And I say this with praise and honor for God.
[time=1674] I attended the theological seminary in Dallas about 100 years ago, I think.
[time=1683] So I've had four years of Hebrew and nine years of Greek, and so I consider myself an educated idiot in those ways.
[time=1691] My point in mentioning this is to say that the Wednesday night Bible study provides excellent review for me.
[time=1698] Do you have to know Greek?
[time=1700] I know a little Greek down the street and he owns a little restaurant.
[time=1703] But anyhow, we have detailed maps and all those kinds of things with art and that kind of thing.
[time=1711] We had a beautiful one this morning.
[time=1715] So the book of Hebrews, as far as I'm concerned, talks about Christ entering into this world and then dying on the cross for our sins,
[time=1725] in the mind and years, raising from the dead and ascending up to heaven and seated at the right hand of the Father where he makes intercession for us.
[time=1734] He sat down indicating that the job is all done.
[time=1739] It's all paid in full like in John 1930, and I can remember my prophet seminary saying the bell just went off.
[time=1748] He meant his redemption work, and the Greek word for that is to tell the eye, and that means it's finished.
[time=1762] Now, regarding a community fellowship, we have about 25 to 35 people who attend from other churches.
[time=1768] Some of them work all day, and they come and are blessed by the fellowship and Bible study.
[time=1775] About 50%, I would say, are married, and 50% of us are single.
[time=1781] They come from various churches in the evening, and what really binds us together is praying together.
[time=1789] And Hebrews 14, 16 says, "Let us approach the throne of grace with confidence."
[time=1795] And the word there means confidence and open and free.
[time=1802] We were singing a song about free, free to do the things that God gives us to do.
[time=1807] You know, folks, the 186 hours between morning service from week to week gets kind of long for me,
[time=1815] and so I'm so glad that in the middle of this, the bridge is gapped by this Wednesday night meeting.
[time=1822] So I'd encourage you all, yes.
[time=1824] In fact, like the Apostle Paul said, you know, he was from southern Tarsus, and he said, "You all come."
[time=1831] Thank you.
[time=1832] Thank you, Vern. Now I have 30 seconds here, brother.
[time=1840] How do you say in two and a half minutes something that's very significant in your life?
[time=1844] Debbie and I have always been involved in ABF.
[time=1847] In fact, my main connect in ABF is we met and won in the late 70s and have been married over 25 years.
[time=1856] And so, you know, it is not in the big corporate setting that you, you know, the corporate worship
[time=1862] that you made the main connections between people.
[time=1865] It's in the smaller settings like serving small groups, ABFs.
[time=1869] Let me drive it home with a word picture.
[time=1871] I have a photo here. Can everybody see that okay?
[time=1873] This is one of the most beautiful spots on the face of the earth.
[time=1877] This is Mount Everest and on a mission trip.
[time=1879] That was part of it was sponsored by people in our ABF.
[time=1883] I went to counsel, missionaries, and provide some training.
[time=1887] But it's a fly-by shooting, so to speak.
[time=1890] But I wanted to do this.
[time=1893] I wanted to see Everest ever since I was a little kid in grade school.
[time=1896] But it lost some of its meaning.
[time=1898] You know why?
[time=1899] Because somebody that I love very much wasn't with me.
[time=1903] Debbie wasn't with me or another trusted friend or maybe somebody from that ABF or somebody from the church here.
[time=1909] And corporate worship can be that way.
[time=1912] It loses, it doesn't lose the significance.
[time=1914] We miss the significance and majesty of it when we aren't connected.
[time=1919] What do I like about our ABF that makes it kind of unique?
[time=1922] Well, one is we do study it, as Vern and Rod said, in the original language, in the Greek language.
[time=1928] And some of you might say, "Well, that sounds really boring." I'd say, "Don't knock it until you've tried it." In fact, I probably laugh more on Sunday morning in the ABF than any other given hour of the week.
[time=1941] We have a great time.
[time=1942] The other thing I think is very significant about it, that really spells something about community.
[time=1947] I looked around one Sunday morning and just discovered it's about half married people and half single.
[time=1953] And so what does that say? That says we're very comfortable in being in community with each other and supporting each other and kind of we have each other's back when one of us is struggling.
[time=1963] And so I want to really encourage you to think of things like small group or an ABF or serving somewhere,
[time=1970] is the primary way to connect and therefore the corporate worship.
[time=1974] You really tap into the mean significance of it.
[time=1977] Well said.
[time=1978] Would you thank you guys for coming this morning?
[time=1980] Thank you very much.
[time=1984] You know, one thing that I'll mention just because I know these folks so well is that while they study
[time=1990] and they are in depth and they prospect through the Scriptures, as Rod said, they love each other.
[time=1997] And I believe that's what God's word produces in people, a great love for each other.
[time=2002] And it is that love that we want to sing about this morning.
[time=2005] Denny's all time favorite songs is this song that Sarah and Corbin are going to lead us in.
[time=2011] So would you all stand and let's worship our God in response to this love that binds us together?
[time=2026] How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure, that He should give His only Son,
[time=2042] to make a rich His treasure, how great the pain of searing loss, the Father chants His face away,
[time=2059] as ones which were the chosen one, bring many sons to glory.
[time=2081] He warned the men upon a cross, my sin upon His shoulders, ashamed I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers.
[time=2103] It was my sin that held Him there until it was accomplished.
[time=2113] His dying breath has brought me alive, I know that it is finished.
[time=2136] I will not boast in anything, no guest, no bow, no wisdom, but I will boast in Jesus Christ, His death and resurrection.
[time=2157] Why should I gain from His reward? I cannot give an answer, but this I know with all my heart,
[time=2173] His wounds have been my ransom, why should I gain from His reward? I cannot give an answer,
[time=2191] but this I know with all my heart, His wounds have been my ransom.
[time=2222] You all can have a seat. One of the other smaller settings that we wanted to introduce you to this morning,
[time=2230] while there are many here on a Sunday morning and we want you to think about, many of you need to think about,
[time=2236] maybe connecting there, there are other smaller settings that meet in homes and other places during the week, and I've asked Dan and Chris Martin to come up and I asked them to bring with them this Sunday their home community,
[time=2249] and we went ahead and asked all of them to come, and the moms, the dads, the boys, the girls, the little ones, the older ones,
[time=2259] and we wanted you to see what this looks like and we wanted you to understand and kind of get a sense
[time=2265] for what it really is like when people decide to live and share and experience life together.
[time=2271] We believe it's what God has called us to, and we're not going to introduce everybody, but these kids have been great.
[time=2278] They have been fantastic both hours, and they're here again this hour.
[time=2282] Would you all thank these little ones for their good job, gang? Nice job, dude.
[time=2289] And Dan's just going to briefly just tell you a little bit about this small community, what it means to him
[time=2295] and kind of what God's been doing in their experience, and then we're going to have Chris and Kim just share a few things.
[time=2300] Go ahead, Dan. Sure.
[time=2302] Kelly talks a lot about diversity.
[time=2305] Well, we've got some diversity in how our small groups in Black Hawk function.
[time=2311] I have never taken any Hebrew. I don't know any Greek.
[time=2318] By necessity, we're not as strong as these folks in studying scripture or in prayer.
[time=2326] But there's five elements, and we really, really believe strongly in focusing on transformational community,
[time=2334] missional serving, and making disciples.
[time=2337] And so that's our focus. We still do the study of scripture.
[time=2341] We just met over on the other side for an hour and talked about how awesome our majestic God is
[time=2348] and how we should approach him.
[time=2354] One thing you can see we're very good at is having lots of kids, and that makes life pretty complicated.
[time=2361] A lot of different struggles, a lot of different things go on in the lives of these folks.
[time=2368] And so our transformational community, we really focus on making it a safe place, a place where people can be comfortable,
[time=2376] no, they're not going to be judged, know that people love them unconditionally, and that we can live life together,
[time=2383] tear down the walls, be transparent, and maybe someday confess sin to one another.
[time=2390] But it's a long process. The enemy is strong.
[time=2395] The scars from previous betrayals are deep.
[time=2402] And so to make that community where we are able to be totally transparent with one another takes a lot of time.
[time=2410] We need to spend more than a few minutes of small talk before our study to live that type of life.
[time=2419] And so what better way to spend time together than serving?
[time=2425] I counted over the last year, I think we've done over 20 projects together.
[time=2431] And those are the ones that are formalized and I know about.
[time=2434] There's numerous others that just happen.
[time=2437] And so we're focused on living life together, serving God, loving one another, loving our brothers.
[time=2445] You know, our greatest command is to love God with all our soul, all our heart, all our mind, and to love our neighbor as ourself.
[time=2454] And these are my neighbors, the people we serve are our neighbors, and that's what we're trying to do.
[time=2460] We're trying to live it out, and hopefully along the way, the Holy Spirit will reveal some of His precious word to us.
[time=2467] And that's our approach.
[time=2468] [AMEN - 1 seconds] Would you thank Dan for what he's doing?
[time=2472] Go ahead.
[time=2475] Go ahead, Chris.
[time=2479] This is my angel who I'm sure 100% God sent to me when I was on a road in my early 20s, far from him.
[time=2489] And running farther away, he sent me this wonderful lady.
[time=2493] Awesome.
[time=2496] Hi, my name is Chris, and I have been married to Dan to 19 years, and I'm a mom, a stay-at-home mom of five children.
[time=2506] Their ages are 23, 18, 16, 3, and 10 months.
[time=2511] So, this group is wonderful to me.
[time=2514] I am so blessed to be part of this group.
[time=2517] I truly feel these people love me and my family.
[time=2522] I love living life with them.
[time=2524] I don't go a week without hearing from or talking to them.
[time=2528] We even try to have play dates with all the kids.
[time=2531] This is very important to us moms also.
[time=2534] When Daniel was born, this group showered us with many, many meals, and we were very, and very supportive to us.
[time=2543] We are showing our children how to live a Christian life with one another, and I love living life with these people.
[time=2550] Well said.
[time=2555] I am so thankful that God put it in our hearts to join a small group.
[time=2560] It has been such a blessing to us to be with a group of people who want to put God first in their lives and who want to continue to grow in their faith.
[time=2570] I love being involved with the community of people who enjoy reading and studying God's Word, who set out on a regular basis to serve others, and who are in a light of encouragement to those going through tough times.
[time=2588] Being in this small group has helped me in many ways, but one of the ways that has really stood out is when one of us or when one of our loved ones is going through a difficult time.
[time=2599] We are there to help each other by praying, writing words of encouragement and sharing God's Word with them.
[time=2610] Knowing that we have a group right behind, knowing that you have a group like this behind you and praying right alongside you gives you an extra strength.
[time=2623] You can feel God's love and God's peace through their support.
[time=2628] Well said, Kim.
[time=2630] Would you all thank this group for their efforts?
[time=2633] (Applause) Thank you guys very much.
[time=2637] Appreciate it.
[time=2639] Hey, we're going to sing a song here in just a minute.
[time=2642] Kim actually shared with us that it's a song that we sing often here that means a lot to her and to those in this group.
[time=2650] I know this group.
[time=2651] I know a lot of the people who are walking off this stage and they have been through a great deal.
[time=2657] And it's their love for each other and their love for God, them being connected to Him and to each other that has brought them through a lot.
[time=2666] And they wanted us to sing this song today, to sing it worshipfully and I just hope you heard them.
[time=2671] I hope you heard two things there.
[time=2673] There's a lot of stuff going on there, praying for each other, play dates, writing notes, standing with each other.
[time=2680] And then there was this other theme of going out and serving and other people and life beyond that living room.
[time=2687] You with me?
[time=2688] And I'm just so grateful for how Dan has led them.
[time=2691] And I want to invite you to stand, if you would, and allow Corbin and the team to lead us here.
[time=2706] I know you're strong, I know you're more than able to save me from whatever ever comes my way.
[time=2716] And I know you are a healer, I know you can deliver, I know that you can rescue me.
[time=2727] But even I cannot see your hand, when you move in a way that I put out a plan.
[time=2738] Still I will worship you, I will worship you.
[time=2746] And there'll be a night out where I will worship you, where in the fire I will worship you.
[time=2756] And I hope seems gone, I will stand and proclaim that you are my God, I will worship you.
[time=2775] I know that you are strong, I know you're more than able to save me from whatever ever comes my way.
[time=2785] And I know you are a healer, I know you can deliver, I know that you can rescue me.
[time=2796] But even when I cannot see your hand, when you move in a way that I put out a plan.
[time=2808] Still I will worship you, I will worship you.
[time=2815] And there'll be a night out where I will worship you, when I'm in the fire I will worship you.
[time=2825] And I hope seems gone, I will stand and proclaim that you are my God, I will worship you.
[time=2845] I will worship you, I will worship you.
[time=2889] I will worship you, I will worship you, I will worship you.
[time=2904] Still I will worship you, when I'm in the fire I will worship you.
[time=2914] Still I will worship you, I will stand and proclaim that you are my God, I will worship you.
[time=2924] I will worship you, when I'm in the fire I will worship you.
[time=2934] Still I will worship you, I will worship you.
[time=2940] That you are my God, yes you are my God, yes you are my God, I will worship you.
[time=2957] You can be seated.
[time=2971] Well hey we want to just tell you one more story, and this is in a Sunday morning adult class,
[time=2977] this is in a home community per se, but this is a story from 212, from our student ministry.
[time=2983] And I am deeply grateful for Jessie, Hannah, and for J.E. and the team of folks that give themselves
[time=2989] tirelessly to our middle schoolers and our high school students, young men and women who so many of them
[time=2996] with a growing hunger to be, who God has called them to be.
[time=3000] And I want to introduce you all to Maddie, Nunchwander, everybody say hi Maddie, she's over here.
[time=3006] That was weak, say hi Maddie.
[time=3009] There you go, much better, a good friend of hers Jessica Walters is here with her.
[time=3014] And Jessie just tell us a little bit about how you first met Maddie and what you've seen God do in there and then Maddie is going to share some things with you.
[time=3021] Alright yeah, I met Maddie as a freshman, she came to 212, and she just seemed like a great kid,
[time=3028] just smiles a lot and is a lot of fun, she goes to Northrop and so just got to hear her story a little bit.
[time=3034] And she's been coming to 212 ever since, she's a junior this year.
[time=3038] And it's just been great, she's been on mission trips with us and fall blast and just watching God do things in her life.
[time=3045] And I'm just going to give to her because it's just really cool what she's going to say.
[time=3050] Hi, I'm Maddie, like they said, I go to Northrop and I've basically been involved with 212 ever since I was a freshman.
[time=3058] I was invited by a friend of a friend and I've been going ever since.
[time=3061] Being connected with 212 I can say literally changed my life.
[time=3066] I guess I just have never experienced such a real environment.
[time=3070] I really feel like since 212 that is the way the church was intended to be, so full of genuine faith and love.
[time=3078] And I guess I just never saw kids thirsting for God so much as I did at 212.
[time=3085] I guess I just didn't realize he was that good and there I was surrounded by kids my age on their knees just begging for more of God.
[time=3094] And God definitely grew me hugely in the years to come from being involved in 212.
[time=3099] Wednesday quickly became like my favorite day of the week.
[time=3102] I remember weeks where I would just like have an awful week and I would just be dying to go to 212 knowing that I'd be there with all my friends.
[time=3109] With people who would encourage me and point me to the one who knows all the answers.
[time=3115] Jesse and all the leaders at 212 they just have such a heart for kids and such a passion for Jesus.
[time=3121] And when they talk they never sugarcoat anything and they ask really hard questions sometimes.
[time=3128] And it brings things to the surface that sometimes I would rather keep hidden.
[time=3132] And let me just say that God has broken down tons of walls in my life through 212.
[time=3138] And Jesse is the first one to come with to you with open arms wanting to take you to Taco Bell and walk you through life struggles.
[time=3146] And I guess I've always grown up a Christian and I was raised in a Christian environment and a Christian home,
[time=3152] but it wasn't really until 212 in the mission trip that I got involved with that God really opened my eyes to show me how blind I actually was.
[time=3160] That I was missing him. He's so big and so awesome and I was missing him.
[time=3165] And I can just say that during these past few years for the first of my life I can say that my faith is not my parents.
[time=3175] It's not my churches and it's mine and it's real and it's genuine.
[time=3179] It's the first time that I can say that this is what I believe and this is what I'm going to live for.
[time=3185] And so God slowly began to change my view of him and let me tell you when that changes everything changes.
[time=3192] And it's just awesome and God is awesome and he's just working in 212 and I can just feel him pulling me in.
[time=3198] And every time he pulls me closer I feel him pulling my friends in closer.
[time=3202] I just hear him saying, "Maddy, there's more, keep coming. I'm still greater yet. It's still awesome or yet."
[time=3208] And that's just an incredible thing and 212 has really provided me with the environment where I can just dive deeper into who Christ is
[time=3214] and who I am in him now.
[time=3216] And not only that, but God has really revealed his heart to us and the passion he has for the lost.
[time=3223] And he is really equipping us for every good thing that he desires out of all of us and in our lives now and in our lives later.
[time=3230] And I'm standing next to my peers and we're being made ready for everything that God has intended for us in this life.
[time=3237] Being connected with 212 has really showed me how sensual the community within the body of Christ is,
[time=3243] how important it is in developing and growing your walk.
[time=3247] And through 212 I've met tons of high schoolers, just like me.
[time=3251] And I think that fellowship is the major reason that God was able to rock my life these last two years.
[time=3256] God has revealed so many of his attributes and I can say that some of these people I've met are like my best friends now.
[time=3263] They come up next to me and they walk me through the hard times in life and point me to Christ when it's the hardest to see him.
[time=3270] And I can just say that these are true friends.
[time=3274] These are friends who care about my soul.
[time=3277] And I care about their soul and it's more important than anything else in life than talking about guys or soccer or whatever.
[time=3284] It's so much more important than whatever Satan tries to take up ground in our lives.
[time=3290] We are the first to come to each other and point each other to the truth and be like this is what it is.
[time=3296] And we don't allow Satan to take up any ground in our life because it's so worth it. God is so good.
[time=3302] And he's just been a huge example to all of us.
[time=3305] And I love the community there and I feel like that has been such an amazing experience just getting to know every single one of them
[time=3312] and grow more deeply in that love with each other and just run this race hand in hand together pulling each other along.
[time=3320] So yeah.
[time=3321] Well done.
[time=3329] Well done. I'm going to have you guys just stay there and just going to have the rest of your stand if you would and stand quietly please.
[time=3336] I want to just, as we leave this morning, I want to just make sure that you're making this connection.
[time=3344] Everything that Maddie just said so well. Thank you, Maddie, for sharing what you did. Everything she just said.
[time=3353] Everything she just gave testimony to. Everything that she just articulated him God doing in her life through that community and that connection he wants to do with you.
[time=3368] All of that he wants to do with you and all of that he does in community when you are connected with those who want to and who are willing to live and share and experience life with you.
[time=3381] He did not make you. He did not design you to live life alone.
[time=3385] And there may be, if you could please, Katie, could you put those five elements back up on the screen?
[time=3391] And I want to just remind those of you and those of you in existing communities, those of you in smaller settings today, you're already kind of connected.
[time=3399] This is what we will today and in the days to come we will keep pushing and lovingly prodding and encouraging you to move with great intention toward the teaching and discussion and application and embracing of those five truths.
[time=3417] If you're in the room this morning and you're thinking you know what, I need that in my life. I really do. There may be you, there may be three or four couples, there may be three or four other guys, there may be three or four other gals, there may be ten or twelve, but you don't have to, you could join an existing one.
[time=3432] You could start one. That's about that. And we'd help you do that. But this is going to continue to be a place in the people that are going to be measured by one thing, the growth and development of those attributes and those pursuits in your life in mind because God wants us to be complete.
[time=3455] He wants us to be like his son. And so we will proclaim him in the gospel and we will teach and admonish and we'll praise him and thank him for what he does. Amen.
[time=3465] Let's pray. Father, thanks for the morning. We mean that. Thank you for this morning and what we were able to see and experience. Thank you for Maddie and for Jessica and Jesse and the hundreds of middle school and high school students represented here in this room.
[time=3482] Thank you for home communities like the Martins and thank you for Rod and Care and what they're doing with so many others in this place on Sunday mornings as they apply the Word of God and build relationship with each other.
[time=3493] God, bless these efforts, draw people closer to you and more deeply to each other in your son's name. We pray. Amen.
[time=3512] [MUSIC]
