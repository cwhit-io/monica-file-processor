[time=145] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=157] Well, hello again everybody. Welcome to the Bible Hour. It's good to be with you as always. I'm here this morning in my baptism t-shirt. I got my swimming suit on and we're getting ready this morning to celebrate baptisms in our worship system.
[time=174] And as I was driving in this morning, it was a great reminder to me as I drove in in my swim trunks and my t-shirt that it's one of the great celebrations. It is one of the greatest moments. It is one of the great joys in my life.
[time=189] And in the life of those on our team and those who call Black Hawk home, baptisms, this celebration of new life when people, young and old, step into those waters and they proclaim.
[time=201] Not only that they've come to faith in Christ, but they proclaim their love for and their desire to be connected with this body of believers. And most of you know that there were those in the first church who did that very thing. You know, Jesus commands that we be baptized.
[time=219] Baptism doesn't save us. Baptism is an indication that we've been saved. It's an act of obedience. And there were those in that first church who did that at the risk of their lives.
[time=231] There were those who did that, who stood in the waters of that river and proclaimed their love for Jesus and their commitment to follow him with others.
[time=240] And they knew that that could bring to them great persecution and great trial and we do it today and great freedom. But still it's an enormous activity.
[time=251] It's an enormous occasion and we're so thankful that we get to do it once a month here at Black Hawk.
[time=257] Hey, I want to tell you about one thing on our website. I want to keep doing my best to just invite you and kind of push you in a gentle way to our website.
[time=265] It's an amazing site with so many things that are available there for you. One of the things I want to make sure you know about is that over on the kind of on the as you're looking at the screen.
[time=276] It's over there on the right hand side about halfway down. You can actually click on a link that allows you to watch the Bible hour message anytime you want right there on our website.
[time=289] And I say this to you because I've bumped into people out in the public who say, "Gosh, I missed the broadcast this week or my shift at work changed and now I don't get to watch it on Sunday mornings."
[time=301] And I want to just make sure you know you can go to our website, click on that link there on the homepage about halfway down.
[time=307] And you can watch the Bible hour message anytime you want 24/7. So we know that it's a resource and tool that God continues to use to encourage so many of you.
[time=319] Share this with your friends. Let them know they can go to the website and watch the Bible hour anytime they want.
[time=324] And our hope and our prayer is that God will continue to use it. Not only to communicate the great life-changing truth of His Word, but to encourage people like you all week long.
[time=334] So I hope you have a great week. I hope to come by and see as soon as you have it.
[time=339] We'd love to put a face with a name. God bless you. Thank you for tuning in and have a great week.
[time=364] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=415] And took the blame and bore the love we stand for give the night the cross.
[time=435] [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=489] It became sin for us. He took the blame, bore the love we stand for give the night the cross.
[time=517] [MUSIC]
[time=532] Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath.
[time=542] [MUSIC]
[time=564] In the dream, for all this, the high of us.
[time=578] Christ became sin for us.
[time=587] He took the blame, bore the night we stand for give the night the cross.
[time=606] [MUSIC]
[time=629] And death is crushed to death. Life is mine to live.
[time=638] Run through yourself last night.
[time=646] And this is the power of that older life across son of God.
[time=659] [MUSIC]
[time=682] We stand for give the night the cross.
[time=696] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=829] Those are some powerful words that you just read and I hope you were able to read all that was on the screen.
[time=838] I've always been struck by the line in that last quote by John Piper where he talks about nibbling, nibbling at the things of the world and in the process missing those great and mighty and deep things that God makes available to us.
[time=854] I want to allow those words my friends and the truth that you saw there in those quotes from profound writers and quotes from the most profound writer of all.
[time=866] I want those quotes and what you saw there to kind of form a foundation for what we'll begin to talk about this morning and what we'll talk about in these next four weeks.
[time=876] What these next four weeks will be is really an introduction to a new series. It's a series that kind of introduces a series and it'll make more sense to you four weeks from now.
[time=888] But I want to begin this morning by giving you the opportunity to see those great truths and then just share with you that over the next several weeks, there is a very important spiritual discussion, a very important biblical discussion that I believe we as friends.
[time=907] I believe we as a church need to have. And when I say we as friends, when I say we as a church, I mean those of you who are senior adults, those of you who are moms and dads, those of you who are 20-some things, those of you who are students and kids, anybody that calls this place home,
[time=926] anybody who names the name of Christ, anybody who has fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ. There are some things I believe that God has made very clear to me in recent weeks, some things he's put on my heart, the heart of our leaders, and I know there is this discussion
[time=944] that I really believe down deep in my heart we have to have and we have to have it now. Not sure how it'll go. I'm not sure how it'll end. I know how I'm hoping and praying it will end, but I know down deep in my heart it's a discussion we must have.
[time=961] And so here's my way too long, way too hard to remember series title. And I say it to you that way because I always try really hard to make the series title really short and easy to remember. What are you guys studying at Blackhawk these days? Oh, it's easy, it's just boom.
[time=978] I tried so hard on this one and I kept trying to say it more succinctly and I kept trying to say it more tightly and I just couldn't, so here it is. This is what we'll be addressing over the next four weeks.
[time=995] The answer, the answer we may not want to hear to a question we rarely ever ask. The answer we may not want to hear to a question we rarely ever ask. And I want to say this up front, this may be for many of us a very difficult conversation.
[time=1023] It may be for many of us in the room of a very difficult spiritual biblical conversation to have. It may bring severe discomfort. It may bring an enormous amount of conviction.
[time=1037] It may even bring remorse. A sense of regret. I know it has in my own heart and life in recent days as I've been thinking this through. But I want to tell you this, I also believe as I've tried my best to listen to God on this one while it may bring discomfort and it may bring conviction and it may bring remorse.
[time=1058] It may also bring in time great repentance in your heart and life. It may also bring great freedom and joy for you and me. But it is a discussion we must have. The answer we may not want to hear to a question we rarely ever ask.
[time=1077] Now as it relates to the answer to this question and even the asking of the question, here's why I want to do this. And I say here's how I want to do this. It's how we do this all the time. It's always how we roll here at Black Hawk. But I want to just say it to you again.
[time=1093] And I think more than ever on this front, I want to make sure you know this is how we're coming at this. I simply want to let the Scriptures, I want to let the Word of God speak into our lives at a very personal level on a very personal topic.
[time=1109] And I'm asking you, I'm asking every one of you that calls this place home to be here, to make it a point to over these next four weeks be here in the room, in the discussion, thinking this through, listening to the Word and Spirit of God.
[time=1127] I want you to make a commitment to join me and the rest of us who faithfully gather each week to encounter him. And let's do that together and see what God will show us and see what God will teach us and to see where God will lead us in the days to come.
[time=1141] I'm very excited. I'm very energized. I'm a little nervous in a good way because again, I'm not sure what God's going to do with this in you or me. It could be something enormous that may take us places we never imagined.
[time=1155] But I believe he wants to do something and I'm very, very much looking forward to it. Why? Because there's an answer that we may not want to hear to a question that doesn't get asked very often.
[time=1170] Listen, what we do with the answer, when we get to it, what we do with the answer has the potential to radically alter our lives, our families' lives, completely transform this church and truly change this community and the world.
[time=1190] So if, if, having asked the question and having arrived at the answer, if we do the right thing with the answer.
[time=1205] I know I may have already completely lost half of you questions and answers and I haven't asked the question yet and I may not even get to it today, but I hope you get the sense that this is important,
[time=1219] that I believe God has some things for you and I to see and realize and understand. I think it's going to take great honesty and great sincerity and a little bit of courage on your part in mind, but I believe he wants to do something.
[time=1233] Are you ready? All right, here we go. Open your Bibles if you would to Psalm 42. Would you do that?
[time=1241] Psalm 42, everybody can look on maybe with somebody next to you if you don't have a scripture to look at yourself. I'm sure they'd be happy to share it with you.
[time=1252] I'd like you to open up to the book of Psalms, Psalm 42 verses 1 and 2. And as we look at Psalm 42 verses 1 and 2, my friends, I want you to listen very carefully this morning.
[time=1269] Don't read it yet, just look at me. I want you to listen as we read this together very carefully to the words and to the heart behind the words.
[time=1281] I want you to listen as the psalmist describes his relationship with God. Many of you, myself included, have one as well a relationship with God. I want you to listen as he describes his relationship with God as he describes his view of God as he describes how valuable God is to him.
[time=1303] I want you to listen this morning. We're going to look at passage after passage after passage. And as we look at those passages, I want you to listen and see how the psalmist shows us where God fits in the picture and priority of his heart and life.
[time=1323] Here we go, Psalm 42. Psalm 42, 1 and 2 says, "As the deer pants for the water brooks, sow my soul, sow my soul, just like the deer, sow my soul, pants for you, oh God.
[time=1341] My soul thirsts for God, for the living God, when shall I come and appear before God?
[time=1354] As the deer pants for the water, sow my soul, pants for you."
[time=1364] Here's how we're going to do this. We're going to go passage after passage after passage. And as we do this, I just want to take some time and point out to you some terminology that God chose to use as God designed this truth for you and I to hear.
[time=1380] My soul, just three here I want to take note of, my soul pants for you. You see that there? I don't know what picture comes to your mind. He gives us the picture of the deer.
[time=1393] When I think of a panting animal, my mind goes to that day and you and I have been there where you get back from the day and a half two day trip and as you're driving in the drive where you have the thought, "Gee, did we put water in the dog's dish?"
[time=1408] You know what I mean? And you pop that garage door and out comes the dog and it's like, you know, she's half dead and she's kind of bent over and the tongue's hanging out the side, it's all thick and she's looking and she's like, "What I thought you loved me?"
[time=1420] Panting, just so thirsty. My soul pants for you. Important that you understand right out of the gate here in this discussion that soul, the word soul, S-O-U-O represents the deepest part of who you are.
[time=1435] It's the spiritual side of you, that deepest, most spiritual in terms of a relationship with him, that intimate place, that deepest place with him and he says, "My soul pants for you."
[time=1451] My soul thirst, look at the text again, it says, "My soul thirsts for God and then he clarifies for the living God." Why does he say that?
[time=1460] My soul pants, just like a deer, my soul pants for you, my soul thirsts for you for the living God. Here, the psalmist helps us in this discussion that we're starting this morning because here he clarifies between a God, capital G, the God, a living God and any other small G God that you and I might be, right?
[time=1484] Might be, of course we are, thirsty for. You and I get thirsty sometimes and we take our thirst towards small G gods that aren't living gods, they're dead empty gods that don't deliver.
[time=1501] We get thirsty so we go to food, our soul gets thirsty so we go to people, we get thirsty so we go to the internet for all kinds of things, we get thirsty so we drink, we get thirsty in our soul and empty so we take pills, we get thirsty so we race off to all kinds of gods, little G gods, and here the psalmist reminds us that in his heart he thirsts after God.
[time=1528] Oh yes, a God, the living, not the dead, not the feudal, not the empty, but the living God. My soul pants for you, my soul thirsts for you living capital G God.
[time=1547] And then I love the, I love the question there at the end of two, when shall I come and appear before God? You know what this is saying?
[time=1556] What this is saying in the vernacular of our day it would be as if he's saying, you know what, I pant for you, I thirst for you, the living true God, when do I get to be with you?
[time=1574] I want to be with you, I want to be in your presence because all this isn't, all this isn't working out so well.
[time=1584] I see this for what it is, I understand this for what it brings and doesn't bring and I, I pant for you, I thirst for you and at the end of the day the honest truth is I want to be with you.
[time=1600] When do I get to be with you?
[time=1604] It's interesting as I read through this Psalm 42, very familiar passage, a passage that you and I have looked at many times over the years as I looked at it again this week and looked at it in the original language of the Hebrew and began to open up and go back through some of the Hebrew resources
[time=1623] and tools that help bring to light what the words mean and the pictures that they paint.
[time=1629] I was amazed all over again to have this picture painted for me of the deer panting in the original language in Psalm 42 and it said, it said here, the Hebrew clearly paints a picture of the panting deer not being by any stretch.
[time=1648] The beautiful dough frolicking around in the grass looking for a sip.
[time=1656] No, the panting deer in the Hebrew of Psalm 42 is a deer who finds himself in a situation where there's been a drought.
[time=1666] The deer is dying. Okay, don't miss that. This deer in Psalm 42 is dying.
[time=1677] It's crawling to the edge of a diminished stream with its tongue hanging out gasping for the one thing it needs.
[time=1688] That's a very important statement and we'll come back to it later.
[time=1696] And the Psalmist says, I'm like that.
[time=1703] That's where I'm at. He says, I'm like a deer who's practically dead sliding its almost dead carcass down an embankment trying to get to a diminished stream that's not even there anymore to get the one thing I know I need.
[time=1722] And I pant for you and I am thirsty for you and I just want to be with you.
[time=1732] And I hope you sense in that the urgency that he has for God and that deep intense longing and craving that he has for him.
[time=1744] Would you turn in your Bibles to Psalm 63?
[time=1748] Just go a few pages back to Psalm 63. If you'd allow me just to read to you Psalm 63 verses 1 to 8.
[time=1759] Psalm 63. And as I read, you'll hear a lot of Psalm 42 terminology. There'll be a lot of drought language here.
[time=1770] It's a theme that we see throughout the Psalms in different places. Oh God, the Psalmist says this is a Psalm of David.
[time=1778] Psalm 63. 1. Oh God, you are my God. I shall seek you earnestly. My soul thirsts for you.
[time=1787] My flesh yearns for you in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[time=1794] Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary. See, your power and your glory because your loving kindness is better than life.
[time=1803] My lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live. I will lift up my hands in your name.
[time=1811] My soul, deepest part of him, is satisfied as with marrow and fatness in you is what's inferred there.
[time=1819] And my mouth offers praises with joyful lips when I remember you on my bed.
[time=1825] I meditate on you and the night watches for you have been my help.
[time=1830] And in the shadow of your wings I sing for joy. My soul claims to you.
[time=1839] Your right hand upholds me.
[time=1844] Incredible. Let me do the same thing with you here. Just some terminology that I want to make sure you catch.
[time=1852] He says here the Psalmist says I seek you earnestly. You are my God. I shall seek you earnestly.
[time=1861] Seek is not a challenging or difficult word for any of us to understand when we're seeking something,
[time=1867] we're looking for something, but have you ever lost something of great value to you?
[time=1872] Have you ever lost a wedding ring? Raise your hand.
[time=1876] Okay, good. Have you ever lost your wallet? Raise your hand.
[time=1879] Yeah, have you ever lost some? They ever lost a picture you didn't ever want to lose.
[time=1883] Ever lost a trinket that meant so much to you. Ever lost a coin that somebody, I mean if you think about it,
[time=1889] there are those times where we lose something and that's something that we lost.
[time=1893] It meant so much to us and it could have been a wallet with a cast paycheck in it that you desperately needed
[time=1901] to like survive. It could have been a ring given to you by a husband or wife years ago.
[time=1907] But the earnestly brings this into perspective because here he's not just looking for something.
[time=1912] No, he's earnestly seeking God and the word earnestly means a dedicated, desperate search.
[time=1920] I've got to find it. I'm not going to stop looking until I do.
[time=1924] I will turn over every couch. I will look under every cushion. I will go back to the store and hunt every aisle
[time=1931] because I have got to find it.
[time=1936] And this is the language of the psalmist as he describes the way in which,
[time=1945] remember what I asked you to do, to listen to how he describes his view of God,
[time=1951] to listen as he describes his relationship with God, to listen this morning church.
[time=1958] As we hear the Scriptures describe the heart of this individual for his Lord.
[time=1965] Now this was compelling to me and I looked it up and I just kept looking it up and it just continued to be an astounding thought.
[time=1971] All through Psalm 42, Psalm 63, already we've seen my soul, my soul, my soul,
[time=1977] that deepest part of your spiritual being, right? You with me?
[time=1981] Now as you go through 63, he says my soul thirst for you.
[time=1984] My, look at the end of verse 1, and my soul thirst for you, my flesh yearns for you.
[time=1995] He says not only does the deepest part of my spiritual being pant and thirst
[time=2001] and want desperately to be with you, my flesh longs for you.
[time=2010] And as I read that and looked at that, I just thought to myself, wait a minute, wow. If I'm going to shoot straight with those guys on Sunday,
[time=2019] which I always try and do, my flesh, my flesh yearns for a lot of things.
[time=2029] And a lot of times, I'd be embarrassed to tell you what it is.
[time=2037] It's not him.
[time=2040] He says my flesh. See, I've lived, he's saying I've lived.
[time=2044] I've watched, I've experienced and at the level of my soul, I'm craving him
[time=2050] and now even my flesh yearns for you, oh God.
[time=2058] He's a dry and weary land back to the text.
[time=2061] In a dry, it says in a dry and weary land, important that you understand,
[time=2067] yes, in the language of the text, in the metaphor, if you will, he's talking about a drought and he's painting the picture of a scorched land, but he does that so that you and I can understand.
[time=2079] He's talking about a dry and weary life.
[time=2082] He's talking about a life that just keeps not adding up.
[time=2086] He's talking about the disappointment. He's talking about the emptiness.
[time=2089] He's talking about the sin that we live in and around.
[time=2092] He's talking about the dry and weary existence that you and I face
[time=2100] and in that he seeks God earnestly, dedicated and desperate search.
[time=2106] Even his flesh cries out for him.
[time=2110] He says, go back to the text and look at verse three, because you're loving kindness, because you, because you're loving kindness, because all that's true about you, when I compare that to my life
[time=2126] and all that I love about life, you're better.
[time=2130] And I want you to think about that. This is not a slap on the wrist.
[time=2133] I'm not trying to stand up here and make you all feel guilty, but I want you to think for a moment about those things in your life that you love.
[time=2141] Think about those things in your life that you love.
[time=2144] Think about the stuff in your life that you get to do.
[time=2146] Think about the places you get to go. Think about the relationships that you have.
[time=2150] Think about the experiences and circumstances and the stuff that you and I get to by God's grace interact with and think about those two or three things that you really, I mean really, really like.
[time=2165] Go ahead. Think about it.
[time=2167] Just tell somebody next to you, whoever's sitting next to you.
[time=2170] Just tell them one of those things. Just share back and forth real quick.
[time=2174] Just tell them one thing that you really love about life.
[time=2178] Go ahead. Tell them real quick.
[time=2185] Probably didn't take you too long. Somebody say something back now.
[time=2189] Next person, share what you love about life.
[time=2195] And here's the point. Here's the point.
[time=2200] The Psalmist knows that your list is long.
[time=2204] His was, I can take you to Psalm after Psalm after Psalm where he talks about the things that he loves and they're good things because they're from God.
[time=2211] God is better.
[time=2220] That's why he pants for him. That's why he thirsts for him.
[time=2224] He wants to be with him.
[time=2227] That's why his flesh cries out for him.
[time=2231] God's love is better than life.
[time=2234] When I remember you on my bed, I love that. Go to verse 6.
[time=2239] When I remember you on my bed, I meditate on you in the night watches.
[time=2244] I kind of thought I knew what that meant, but then I looked it up and began to study what it meant and it meant what I thought it meant.
[time=2251] Sometimes, listen, sometimes the longing for him was so intense.
[time=2256] Sometimes the panting for God, so great.
[time=2260] Sometimes the thirsting of the soul or flesh, take your pick.
[time=2264] Sometimes he wanted to be with him so deeply and so badly that sometimes he couldn't sleep.
[time=2273] It was so overwhelming and it was so all-consuming that it would literally keep him up or wake him up at night.
[time=2281] And when he would wake up at night, he would meditate in those night watches. He can't even sleep.
[time=2289] He's so mindful of God and wanting more of him.
[time=2296] And I love what it says here at the end of 63.
[time=2298] Verse 8, my soul clings to you.
[time=2304] My soul clings to you, the soul, the deepest part of who I am when you get
[time=2312] right down to it in the face of all that's out there, God, in the face that all this world has to offer, in the face of all the things I bump into and wrestle with and struggle with, in the midst of all of this world in this place at the end of the day, I've concluded my soul clings to you, cling.
[time=2333] Great word.
[time=2334] You want to know what it means?
[time=2336] It's the deepest part of me clutching on to God.
[time=2340] It's what you might have done when you found that ring you lost.
[time=2349] It is a clutching that describes this intense personal, intimate feeling.
[time=2357] I may have told you this story before, but I'll say I'll never forget it as long as I live of all the traveling that God's allowed me to do, of all the places that God's allowed me to go.
[time=2368] You know, it was a, I don't know, a couple, two, three years ago that I, two years ago, a little over two years ago that I went on our second trip to Nairobi.
[time=2379] You allowed me and a few of our team members to go about three years ago, but then it came time for us to take our first team to Nairobi to the orphanage there.
[time=2388] And it was an amazing experience.
[time=2390] And it was just an, it was an odd thing to me because I had been gone away from Kebra and the kids before, but there was something about this trip.
[time=2398] Maybe it was just that it was as far away as it was.
[time=2401] I think it was a, maybe an extra long trip.
[time=2404] I think it was about 12, maybe 13 days.
[time=2407] And I'll never forget being about six, seven days into it, just being completely done.
[time=2412] Emotionally, I didn't let the team know or I tried not to, but there was something inside me at about six or seven days.
[time=2418] And I just, I literally lay in my, my, lay in my mosquito net at night and cry
[time=2424] because I wanted to be home because I just was, I missed them so badly.
[time=2428] And yet we, you know, we trudged on an amazing 12, 13 days.
[time=2432] And it was a good time.
[time=2434] And I'll never forget getting on the plane in Nairobi, flying to Amsterdam
[time=2441] and missing our connection in Amsterdam.
[time=2444] And it just blew the whole thing up.
[time=2446] And I was just desperate to get home.
[time=2449] We all were.
[time=2450] And because we missed our connecting flight, all of a sudden they were dividing us up.
[time=2454] And some were going to this country and some were going to that country.
[time=2458] I just wanted to go home.
[time=2461] And it was just the only way they could do it for me.
[time=2464] I remember Tony and Hannah ended up going to Toronto.
[time=2467] And they look at me and say, we can get you home, but you're going to have a six and a half hour layover in Detroit.
[time=2475] And I remember thinking to myself, how bad is this?
[time=2477] How bad is Detroit for six and a half hours when you're like three hours away, like my car?
[time=2482] So I said, fine, I was so discouraged.
[time=2485] I so wanted to see her face and their faces.
[time=2490] And I knew the six and a half hours was just going to be horrible.
[time=2495] And so I make the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.
[time=2499] And I land in Detroit.
[time=2501] And I remember standing up to get my bag out of the top there.
[time=2505] And I turn my phone on and it buzzes.
[time=2507] And it's a text from my wife with four of like the sweetest words you've ever, ever seen.
[time=2514] Just watched you land.
[time=2518] I'm like, no way.
[time=2520] I start crying in the aisle right there.
[time=2522] I'm like, you're kidding me.
[time=2523] And she had gotten the kids out of school, loaded them up in the car, and driven to Detroit, which if you know my wife and my kids, that right there is an amazing endeavor.
[time=2532] They'll ride with her.
[time=2534] There's about a 20 mile radius within which they'll ride with her.
[time=2537] And she's so much better than me on so many fronts.
[time=2541] On the directional front, I got her beat.
[time=2545] But they trusted her and God was gracious.
[time=2547] And she gets all five kids and they get on the freeway.
[time=2550] They drive it.
[time=2551] They find the airport.
[time=2552] They park.
[time=2553] They get to where they're supposed to be.
[time=2554] And I'm telling you what, clinging, clutching.
[time=2559] Asama says, is what I did when I came out of those doors at the international
[time=2565] terminal there having gone through customs.
[time=2567] And we just cried and laughed.
[time=2570] And I remember just saying to myself in that moment, I didn't want to let go.
[time=2576] Just didn't want to let go.
[time=2577] The psalmist says, you know what?
[time=2580] I just, I don't want to let go of you.
[time=2584] I cling.
[time=2586] I clutch to you.
[time=2589] You know, dry and weary land.
[time=2591] Look at Psalm 119, if you would.
[time=2595] Skip back a few pages to Psalm 119, 20.
[time=2600] It says in Psalm 119, 20.
[time=2604] I just started, I'll tell you what, I got to Psalm 42 a couple of weeks ago and started thinking about panting and longing.
[time=2610] And it just took me all over the place.
[time=2612] And I loved it when I came to Psalm 119, 20.
[time=2614] "My soul," the psalmist says, "deep as part of who you are, a place that represents your greatest spiritual desires and realities.
[time=2623] My soul is crushed with longing after your ordinances,
[time=2629] after you more specifically after your word at all times.
[time=2633] My soul is crushed with longing for you and your truth."
[time=2639] You know what that word "crushed" means?
[time=2641] That word "crushed" because he wants something so badly
[time=2647] and it's hard for him to get it.
[time=2649] His soul is crushed.
[time=2652] When the gal in Amsterdam looked at me and said, "I can get you to Detroit, but six and a half hours, that was crushing." And he says, "My soul, because I want you, and I pant for you, and I thirst for you, and I yearn for you, and I earnestly seek you anytime I can't have you.
[time=2673] When I even think about you and your truth, my soul," he says, "is crushed." Then, oh my, then I came to Psalm, then it took me to Psalm 119, 131.
[time=2689] You may know this.
[time=2690] You may have seen this.
[time=2691] I don't think I've ever read this.
[time=2693] I don't think at least.
[time=2694] I never read it in this context.
[time=2696] And when I read it, I almost came out of my office and ran down the hall.
[time=2702] I mean, it just blew me away.
[time=2703] Psalm 119, 131.
[time=2705] It really says this.
[time=2707] This is the psalmist.
[time=2709] This is David.
[time=2710] I opened my mouth wide and panted.
[time=2717] And I don't know, as you read that or listen to that,
[time=2724] I opened my mouth wide and I panted for your commandments, and you can just add there that bad.
[time=2732] You know, that strongly, that deeply, that intently.
[time=2737] And it was, I don't know, it was kind of like okay for me to think about it when I was thinking about a deer doing it.
[time=2743] Does that make sense?
[time=2746] But go ahead.
[time=2748] Somebody open up your mouth right now.
[time=2751] Wide and pant, like a dying deer.
[time=2758] And he doesn't say, "It's as if I did." He says, "I do." It's just that real to him and it runs that deep in him.
[time=2771] It's almost kind of uncomfortable to think about.
[time=2774] All of us, like, sticking our tongues out right now and panting.
[time=2782] But it's like he's shameless.
[time=2784] And he just wants you to know that there is a place that you and I can go with him.
[time=2791] That deep that evokes that kind of longing and yearning and thirsting.
[time=2796] When was the last time you did that?
[time=2801] Any circumstance?
[time=2804] I mean, I think about working out like I'm trying to do again in my life.
[time=2810] I think about situations that you've been in.
[time=2814] You know, mostly I think about physical situations that lead us to these places of just panting mouth open wide.
[time=2824] Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please give me something.
[time=2828] When was the last time, maybe not the last time you did it.
[time=2832] I mean, when was the last time you were close to being in that place?
[time=2841] And was it?
[time=2843] Or I'll just say it this way.
[time=2845] I bet.
[time=2847] If I were a betting man, I bet it wasn't about him.
[time=2853] Maybe it was.
[time=2854] And if it was, praise God.
[time=2859] So then I'm 42 and I see the deer sliding down the bank and I go to 63 and his flesh is yearning.
[time=2869] He just wants to be with him and the longing and the panting thing continues and I go to Psalm 119 and he's crushed and Psalm 119, 131.
[time=2877] He's literally sitting there with his mouth open, his tongue hanging out panting because he wants so badly
[time=2883] to have him and his word and then it flipped me back to Psalm 81.
[time=2890] Would you go there with me?
[time=2891] I'm going to have Corbin and the guys come on up.
[time=2896] Go to Psalm 81, would you?
[time=2898] This was great.
[time=2900] It took me to 81 and I had to read a little bit, but then I got to the end and I'm like, oh, wow.
[time=2906] Oh, my.
[time=2907] Psalm 81.
[time=2910] Psalm 81, 7 to 10.
[time=2918] Listen, my friends, listen to the words of the psalmist.
[time=2921] Listen to his heart as he describes his relay.
[time=2925] I said this to you at the beginning today.
[time=2927] As he describes his relationship with God, his view of God, the place and the priority of God in his life.
[time=2933] What he believes to be true about God.
[time=2936] Look at Psalm 81, 7 to 10.
[time=2938] You called in trouble and I rescued you, God here speaking through the psalmist.
[time=2942] I answered you in the hiding place of thunder.
[time=2947] I proved you at the waters of Maribah, here, oh, my people, and I will admonish you.
[time=2953] Oh, Israel.
[time=2955] If you would listen to me, I've asked you all morning to do this, haven't I, to listen?
[time=2962] Oh, Israel.
[time=2965] If you would listen to me, let there be no strange, say it out loud right now.
[time=2972] There you go, let there be no strange God among you, nor shall you worship any foreign what?
[time=2980] Say it.
[time=2982] I, the Lord, am your what?
[time=2986] God.
[time=2987] Big G, capital G, say it big.
[time=2990] I, the Lord, I, the Lord, am your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
[time=2997] And here it is, here it is.
[time=2999] Can you believe he says this?
[time=3000] Open your mouth wide.
[time=3005] Can you, yeah, incredible.
[time=3007] Open your mouth wide.
[time=3010] And I will what?
[time=3012] I'll fill it.
[time=3014] Pant, pant like a dying deer.
[time=3018] Want me that badly.
[time=3021] And I'll fill it.
[time=3022] I'll be for you what all the entertainment and all the pleasure and all the internet and
[time=3028] all the shopping and all the belongings and all the square footage can't give you.
[time=3033] Open your mouth and pant like a dying deer.
[time=3038] Let your flesh yearn for me.
[time=3040] Go ahead.
[time=3041] Open it wide.
[time=3044] And I'll fill it.
[time=3048] I'm going to ask Corbin to lead us in some worship.
[time=3052] Just write along these lines.
[time=3056] We didn't get anywhere near the answer.
[time=3058] We didn't even ask the question.
[time=3060] But here's your assignment for the week.
[time=3062] I promise you we'll ask the question next week.
[time=3065] But I think maybe some of you know the question.
[time=3068] And as we think about it, and I want to ask you to think about it this week.
[time=3072] Every day, go back to these passages.
[time=3074] Read them again.
[time=3075] And I want you to think about what's the question that would be so important for me to ask having read this, having thought about this.
[time=3082] We'll come back next week.
[time=3084] We're going to build it a little bit more.
[time=3086] Look at a few more passages and then we're going to ask the question and begin to think through God's answer.
[time=3092] Corbin, if you want to stay seated, you may.
[time=3096] If you'd like to stand as you sing these songs, feel free to do that too.
[time=3104] I am yours, set apart for you.
[time=3112] I am yours, hungry for your truth.
[time=3118] Take my life.
[time=3120] You are all I live for.
[time=3125] I am yours, set apart for you.
[time=3132] I am yours, hungry for your truth.
[time=3139] Take my life.
[time=3141] You are all I live for.
[time=3146] Take my life.
[time=3148] You are all I live for.
[time=3153] Take my life.
[time=3155] You are all I live for.
[time=3160] How love feels.
[time=3163] You're dwelling place.
[time=3168] Oh Lord, oh mighty.
[time=3174] For my soul bonds and even fangs for you.
[time=3188] Here my heart is satisfied within your presence.
[time=3201] I sing beneath the shadow of your wings.
[time=3214] Batteries one day in your courts.
[time=3242] My heart and flesh cry out for you the living God.
[time=3248] Your spirit's water to my soul.
[time=3255] I've tasted and I've seen cons again to be.
[time=3261] I will drum dear to you.
[time=3273] Batteries one day in your courts.
[time=3282] Thousands of swear.
[time=3285] Batteries one day in your courts.
[time=3295] Thousands of swear.
[time=3298] Batteries one day.
[time=3318] Batteries one day in thousands of swear.
[time=3324] Thousands of swear.
[time=3331] Take my life.
[time=3333] You are all I live for.
[time=3338] Take my life.
[time=3340] You are all I live for.
[time=3345] Take my life.
[time=3347] You are all I live for.
[time=3353] I am yours.
[time=3359] Hey if you just stand with the rest of us and everybody please just stand with your eyes closed and your heads bowed.
[time=3369] Let me just say this to you as we leave this morning.
[time=3374] The psalmist paints a very real and very honest picture.
[time=3378] And you're right some of these pictures were painted in times of absolute distress.
[time=3384] But there are other psalms and other places in scripture that describe for us the everyday of life.
[time=3391] And in this everyday of life picture we hear we listen, right church?
[time=3397] We listen to these words like longing and thirsting
[time=3403] and hungering after and craving and earnestly seeking and panting after him.
[time=3413] And there's a question I think in there that we are going to have to ask.
[time=3421] And oh God in heaven I pray this morning and we pray as a family that you give us the courage and the readiness to ask that question.
[time=3431] And oh God as your word reveals to us the answer.
[time=3435] God may we be faithful.
[time=3437] And may we have courage then as well and may we trust you deeply and walk with you obediently as we pursue repentance.
[time=3445] As we listen to your answer and begin individually and as a people to move in different directions.
[time=3452] God we thank you for the morning.
[time=3455] We long for your courts.
[time=3458] You're all we need.
[time=3460] We're yours.
[time=3462] And we pray God that you'd be with us as we go help us to be priests who pass you along to others.
[time=3469] Oh God may we pass along your attributes of love and grace and compassion each and every step in every place that we go.
[time=3478] And all the people agreed and said amen God bless you.
[time=3488] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
