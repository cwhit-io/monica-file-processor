[time=114] (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast. We're thankful. Really thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=143] And if you tune in last week, you know, that we've kind of started a little mini teaching series.
[time=148] It's a series that's going to lead to a more extensive series.
[time=152] But nonetheless, we began last week to ask a question.
[time=156] We didn't really get to the question last week you're going to hear us ask that question today.
[time=162] And I want to just say it to you like this again. There is a question that we rarely ask.
[time=168] And there's an answer to that question that we may not want to hear.
[time=173] And as we think this through, I just can't tell you how hopeful I am that you'll engage with us in this discussion.
[time=180] I can't tell you how hopeful I am that you would open up your heart and your life to the life-altering, life-changing power of God's Word.
[time=190] It's in God's Word that we find this discussion.
[time=193] And I want you to know this as you hear us ask the question this morning.
[time=198] You're going to have a chance to ask not only that question, but a series of questions.
[time=203] Very honest, very probing questions that will require of you and me a very authentic, very honest, very humble answer.
[time=213] And I pray that as you watch this today, I pray that as you continue in this courageous spiritual discussion
[time=220] that you would have the courage and the willingness to not only ask yourself the question, but then over the next few weeks, would you make sure, would you make it a priority to join us?
[time=231] There is an answer to this question that you and I desperately need to wrestle with.
[time=236] And so I hope you'll come and be with us live and in person on a Sunday morning, nine and ten forty-five.
[time=242] If you can't make it here, I pray you'll watch the broadcast next week.
[time=246] If you missed the broadcast, I hope you'll go online and watch the broadcast on our website.
[time=251] You can watch that broadcast tape anytime when you go to blackhawkministries.org.
[time=256] But here's the thing, over the next three weeks, the answer to the question that we're going to ask today
[time=263] is absolutely crucial for you and I.
[time=267] It can, if we handle this answer appropriately, it can change your life.
[time=271] If we handle the answer to the question in a way that honors God, it can transform our church, it can transform the world.
[time=280] People who wrestle with this issue are the kind of people who God uses, I believe, to bring transformation and change to a world that desperately needs it.
[time=289] But you and I have to be honest with ourselves and we have to answer the question.
[time=295] So listen today, the question will get asked and then join us over the next few weeks.
[time=300] I hope and I pray that you'll give this an honest and prayerful effort.
[time=306] I hope that you'll come before God and open your heart and life.
[time=309] Every part of it to what he has for you over these next few weeks.
[time=314] Hey, God bless you.
[time=315] It's an honor for me to be able to bring this truth to you week after week and I hope it's encouraging to you.
[time=322] Enjoy the broadcast.
[time=324] Have a great week.
[time=325] As always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=327] God bless you.
[time=328] Take care.
[time=330] [MUSIC] While I am unaware.
[time=351] [MUSIC] But I never hear the sound.
[time=364] [MUSIC] Lord, I'm amazed by you.
[time=377] [MUSIC]
[time=387] How you love me.
[time=390] [MUSIC]
[time=401] You pay the morning sky.

[time=423] For you hold me in your hand.
[time=427] [MUSIC]
[time=439] Lord, I'm amazed by you.
[time=446] [MUSIC]
[time=454] Lord, I'm amazed by you.
[time=466] [MUSIC]

[time=547] [MUSIC]
[time=555] How you love me.
[time=558] [MUSIC]
[time=563] Lord, I'm amazed by you.
[time=568] Lord, I'm amazed every day.
[time=574] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=612] Be still and know that he is God.
[time=617] [MUSIC - 26 seconds]
[time=650] You knock so hard on that door, but still there's no one home.
[time=657] [MUSIC]
[time=672] You are more than just enough.
[time=677] [MUSIC]
[time=686] Even when times you are.
[time=691] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=711] Everything is slipping away, or falling apart.
[time=718] He gazes down on you, beaming with love, singing child.
[time=725] You're more than just enough.
[time=729] [MUSIC]
[time=739] You are more than just enough.
[time=742] [MUSIC]
[time=753] You're more than just enough.
[time=756] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=820] When I scroll more than I fall.
[time=823] [MUSIC]
[time=827] When I'm dry and empty.
[time=829] [MUSIC]
[time=835] You are more than just enough.
[time=839] [MUSIC]
[time=849] Even when times get rough.
[time=853] [MUSIC]
[time=870] You are more than just enough.
[time=873] Just enough.
[time=877] [MUSIC]
[time=884] Please be more than just enough.
[time=890] [MUSIC]
[time=905] Hey, with your heads bowed, maybe in your eyes closed just for a moment here.
[time=912] I know that there are many of you in the room this morning.
[time=916] And you believe that to be true.
[time=920] That he is more than just enough, that he is all you would ever need, that in him and in relationship with him, you have been provided with every blessing made available in the heavenlies, that there is great strength, and there is great courage, and there is great hope to be found in him.
[time=941] I know I would see hands all over the room.
[time=945] If I said if you believe that, you know, raise them.
[time=949] But here's what I want you to do.
[time=951] I'll tell you, first hour, I heard that song, and for me, my mind just went racing back through the week.
[time=958] And all the times in this past week, when I chose or acted or spoke in ways that would indicate I didn't believe that.
[time=972] And I want to just give you an opportunity here in these moments to just confess whatever you might need to confess.
[time=981] When you chose to go over here, or you chose to chase that, or you gave yourself to this bit of relief over here, you and I and are chasing after little gods that don't sustain us and don't fulfill us and leave us empty.
[time=999] I want to just give you the opportunity to confess before him
[time=1006] whatever you may need to make right.
[time=1011] Father God, we do believe that so many of us in the room.
[time=1023] We believe it deeply, and yet we are tempted each and every day to make choices and move in directions where we would seek all that we need and try to find that fulfillment in other places through other means and other ways.
[time=1041] God, we confess that to you and we proclaim again that you are more than enough.
[time=1046] In you, we find our deepest desires met.
[time=1050] In you, God, we find peace and meaning.
[time=1052] We find great significance and joy.
[time=1055] And thank you for the reminder of that today.
[time=1058] And all the people in the room agreed and said amen.
[time=1064] Well, hey, let's jump in here where we left off last week.
[time=1068] The answer that you may not want to hear to a question that rarely gets asked.
[time=1078] Last week here in the gathering, I really just asked you to do two things.
[time=1084] First of all, I asked you to listen.
[time=1088] And I asked you several times throughout the morning, and I'm so thankful.
[time=1092] I think many of you did.
[time=1094] I asked you to listen to the Word of God.
[time=1098] To listen to what God's Word had to say to you through the pen of the psalmist.
[time=1104] As the psalmist described for us his view of God, his own personal desire for God and the priority that God held in the psalmist's own heart and life.
[time=1115] I asked you to listen to what God's Word had to say to you and listen to the picture that the scriptures paint of those who desired him and longed for him and craved him.
[time=1131] And secondly, I asked you to have some spiritual guts.
[time=1136] If you will.
[time=1138] I asked you to be courageous enough to see this spiritual discussion that we began last week through to the end.
[time=1146] To sit here in this room for five Sundays and really, really truly allow God full access to all of your heart, all of your mind and all of your life.
[time=1156] Every part of it.
[time=1157] Every compartment, every room, every arena.
[time=1160] And I promised you last week and I will reiterate that promise to you this morning that if you will listen to the Word of God and if you will exercise courage
[time=1174] in your willingness and readiness to wrestle with what we see and find and if you will obey him on this topic.
[time=1183] I believe the Spirit of God and I believe the Word of God will alter your life completely.
[time=1188] I believe your heart and life and your home and your family could be transformed.
[time=1192] I believe this church could be transformed and I believe our world could be radically reached.
[time=1199] And I want to remind you this morning, I mean that the world can be changed by people who walk this road.
[time=1206] The world gets changed by people who are willing to enter into this discussion.
[time=1214] And people who are willing to respond appropriately to the answer.
[time=1221] The answer you may not want to hear to a question that rarely gets asked.
[time=1228] So last week, last week we listened and saw the heart
[time=1234] of a God follower whose relationship with God was marked by words, phrases and pictures like this.
[time=1250] He panted after God, longing.
[time=1254] He longed to be with God, craving.
[time=1257] He craved the presence and the touch of God on his life, panting and longing and craving and yearning, desperately seeking, hungering and thirsting.
[time=1270] These were the words, these were the phrases.
[time=1272] These were the pictures we saw the Word of God paint for us as we looked into the heart and life of the psalmist.
[time=1278] We saw this raw, can't sleep at night because you fill my thoughts, you're better than life.
[time=1285] Oh God, when can I be with you?
[time=1287] I want more of you mindset and approach to God.
[time=1292] This is what we saw.
[time=1295] We even went beyond the scriptures, not as if we needed to, but we even took a look at some of the quotes from the great minds and deep hearts who like the psalmist longed for God and the Lord in his presence, like this one from Owen.
[time=1312] You'll see it on the screen, John Owen, said, "Oh, to behold the glory of Christ, herein in the glory of Christ and the presence of Christ, herein would I live, herein would I die, herein would I dwell in my thoughts and affections, till all things below become unto me a dead and deformed thing, no way suitable for affectionate embraces."
[time=1342] And this morning, we're simply going to do two things yet again.
[time=1347] Number one, as painful and thrilling all at the same time, as painful and as thrilling as it may be, we're going to keep listening.
[time=1356] I'm going to invite you again to listen carefully to the Word of God, to listen to its phrases, to listen to its truth, to listen and take in the pictures that it paints.
[time=1369] I want you to understand and see again normal everyday people like you and me and their love for and their longing for, and their all-out pursuit of God.
[time=1385] And then secondly, we are going to ask the question.
[time=1390] I promise. We'll get there today.
[time=1393] Today we're going to ask the question.
[time=1396] We probably won't get to the answer today, but I promise you today we'll ask the question.
[time=1403] Ready to go? All right, here we go. Psalm 27.
[time=1407] Actually, hold on. Before you, hang on, I'm sorry.
[time=1411] Don't go to Psalm 27 yet. Everybody look up here at me.
[time=1415] Now you know where we're going. We're going to Psalm 27, and I had a conversation this week with a friend about this, and I thought it was a really good point, and I want to try to make it here quickly.
[time=1425] We're going to go to Psalms, and we're going to see again much of what we saw last week.
[time=1429] And I know many of you, like me, were blown away by what we saw last week, and it kind of can tend to give you and I this view of the one who writes it, and we've got to be careful about that view.
[time=1442] I told you last week, I didn't read all of that to kind of spiritually slap you on the wrist.
[time=1448] This was not an endeavor to somehow kind of elevate some individual or individuals, but I wanted you to be aware of what is possible.
[time=1457] I wanted you to be aware of how we really can think.
[time=1460] I wanted you to see for yourself from the heart and pen of one who we have great admiration for, the psalmist, mainly David.
[time=1469] I wanted you to see what went on in his heart.
[time=1473] I want to remind you this morning, and I don't know what this will do to your view of him or all that we saw from him last week.
[time=1486] But he's the same guy who watched Bathsheba take a bath
[time=1493] from his balcony when all the other kings were out to war, which is where he should have been.
[time=1502] It's the same guy who had her summoned to his palace bed so he could have sex with her, and it's the same guy who then had her husband killed
[time=1518] so he could move on with as little ripple effect as possible.
[time=1526] Blessed you idolize him and think that he's this perfect, pristine God follower who does no wrong.
[time=1536] He's not.
[time=1538] He's just like you.
[time=1542] And he's just like me.
[time=1545] And honestly, that doesn't diminish my view of him, and it doesn't diminish the message we heard last week at all.
[time=1554] In my heart, really, it elevates it.
[time=1556] I'm so grateful that God gives us examples of those who live in the same tensions and struggles that you and I do.
[time=1564] And yet, in light of all those tensions and struggles, we still get to see a man after God's own what?
[time=1570] A man after God's own heart.
[time=1574] So let's keep reading the Psalms, shall we?
[time=1577] Psalm 27, 4.
[time=1579] I love the imagery.
[time=1580] I love the picture this paints for us, my friends.
[time=1583] Psalm 27, 4, we get to see more of his relationship with God and his desire for him.
[time=1589] It says there in the fourth verse of chapter 27.
[time=1594] It says one thing, underline that.
[time=1598] Put a circle around that if you're okay writing in your Bible.
[time=1601] One thing I have asked from the Lord.
[time=1606] This is a psalm of David.
[time=1608] It's psalm of fearless trust in God.
[time=1611] It says at the top of my text.
[time=1613] One thing I have asked from the Lord that I shall seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to meditate in his temple.
[time=1627] One thing I have asked from the Lord and that one thing I shall seek that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
[time=1638] Just like last week, there's some terminology that I want to just point out to you that some of it's pretty clear, some of it could use a little definition, so I'll do my best to kind of just pass it along to you.
[time=1649] I want you to take note of that.
[time=1651] One thing, one thing in the Hebrew, the emphasis that's given there, the way that's written and the way it plays out, what he's really saying is the only thing that really matters to me of all the things I could ask for.
[time=1663] And there could be hundreds, literally there could be thousands of things that he could ask for.
[time=1667] While the options are many, while the list is long, of all the things I could ask of you really at the end of the day, it boils down to this.
[time=1676] Here's the one thing that I would long for.
[time=1680] Here is the one thing that I desire.
[time=1684] Oh, and by the way, it is so at the top of my list that I will seek it.
[time=1692] I will aggressively, with great dedication and effort and with great diligence, seek.
[time=1698] I will seek after this one thing that really matters the most to me.
[time=1706] And what is that one thing?
[time=1709] That I may dwell, David says, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord.
[time=1715] That I may dwell in the house of the Lord.
[time=1718] Again, you can underline our circle, house of the Lord.
[time=1721] Two things here I want you to see.
[time=1722] Number one, he is referring to, there is something in this phrase that is definitely tied to the literal physical house of the Lord.
[time=1732] All my friends, David found great joy in being in the temple.
[time=1736] David found great joy in the place of worship.
[time=1739] Are you with me?
[time=1741] When David and the people of God would gather, all David found great closeness and great comfort.
[time=1747] And he found great peace as he came into the house, the literal building, the place, the tent of worship.
[time=1754] I mean, it was a huge deal to him.
[time=1759] And he does mean that.
[time=1761] And you and I can give thought to that as well.
[time=1763] There is great joy and there is great comfort when we come together and meet with and encounter God in the gathering of God's people.
[time=1773] Nothing magical about the brick and mortar.
[time=1777] But here he is talking about a place he would go and a people he would be with.
[time=1782] But watch this, in the Hebrew, when you look at this house of the Lord, what it's really getting at and what it's really communicating,
[time=1792] the one thing he wanted the most and the one thing he would seek is to dwell in the house of the Lord in the Hebrew.
[time=1801] The main meeting has to do with the fact that it's in that house that he felt most intimate with God.
[time=1808] What he's after here, my friends, what he's saying is, oh, at the end of the day, the one thing that matters most to me is I want to dwell in intimacy with God.
[time=1818] I want to be that close.
[time=1820] I want to be so with him. I want to be so close to him.
[time=1823] I want to be so connected to him.
[time=1826] House of the Lord, physical place, yes, but it has an analogy that really speaks to this issue of relational intimacy that he found and experienced with God.
[time=1837] And here's the amazing thing.
[time=1839] There's one thing I have asked for and I'll seek it is to dwell, to live, to be in intimacy with God all the days of my what?
[time=1850] Say it. My life. Interesting.
[time=1853] Sometimes where we go with that, and sometimes we even see it in Scripture, as someone would say, this one thing I've asked for and I will seek is that I could dwell in the house of the Lord for eternity.
[time=1865] Sometimes those kinds of lofty aspirations get connected to forever and ever.
[time=1872] But he doesn't say forever and ever.
[time=1876] Here and again in the Hebrew, he's talking about all the days of his what?
[time=1880] Say it. Life, the way you could read that is all the days of my living.
[time=1887] While he's very confident of forever, he's talking about a desire he has for God now.
[time=1894] Today, here in the present, it's one thing I want and oh,
[time=1900] I will seek it is to be in intimacy with God all the days of my living.
[time=1907] All the days of my life.
[time=1911] You know what? Just go down to the next chapter.
[time=1914] Go to Psalm 28, we find just more and more evidence.
[time=1920] More and more of the picture that Scripture paints of his heart for God and his longing for God and his desire to be with God.
[time=1929] Psalm 28, 1.
[time=1932] To you, O Lord, to Psalm of David.
[time=1936] To you, O Lord, I call.
[time=1938] My rock.
[time=1940] Do not be deaf to me.
[time=1943] You see where he's going?
[time=1945] Do not be deaf to me.
[time=1947] For if you are silent to me, I will become like those who go down to the pit.
[time=1956] To you, O Lord, I call.
[time=1958] My rock.
[time=1960] Do not be deaf to me.
[time=1962] For if you, what's it say there?
[time=1965] For if you are silent to me.
[time=1973] There's some terminology for you.
[time=1974] If you are silent, I go down.
[time=1978] If I can't hear from you, I'm done.
[time=1983] If I don't get to hear your voice, I'm unraveled.
[time=1987] If I don't get to hear from you, if I don't get to sense and hear your direction, if I call out to you and there's this distance or this gap between us,
[time=1998] count me out.
[time=2000] I'm done.
[time=2001] I go down to the pit.
[time=2006] He's so desperate to hear from God that if he doesn't, he's destroyed.
[time=2013] It got me thinking about all the things we listen to.
[time=2017] I don't know all the things you listen to.
[time=2022] I don't know all the voices that you allow into your mind.
[time=2031] But I know you pretty well and you know me pretty well and we can so many times be desperately rushing and wanting to hear stuff.
[time=2043] And we do it through all kinds of avenues and all kinds of means.
[time=2046] But boy, the psalmist said at the end of the day, he just wants to hear God.
[time=2051] That's the voice.
[time=2052] That's the message.
[time=2053] That's the song.
[time=2056] He wants to hear.
[time=2061] Let's move on from the Psalms.
[time=2064] Why don't you turn to Habakkuk 3 and we'll wait 15 minutes while you get there.
[time=2076] When I was young, like really young, there was a message I gave one time.
[time=2080] There wasn't Habakkuk, but I asked everybody to turn to this one book and I couldn't find it.
[time=2085] How embarrassing is that?
[time=2087] It's actually on page 1292 if you're interested.
[time=2091] And if somebody next to you is right now looking in their table of contents, just cut them some slack, all right?
[time=2098] Habakkuk, now we're not hearing from the psalmist, now we're hearing from the prophet.
[time=2104] Habakkuk says in chapter 3, verses 17 through 19, what a powerful passage.
[time=2111] And though the fig tree should not blossom, now remember who he's writing to, remember he speaks to a people here who would have in that day in this setting been a very agrarian society.
[time=2121] They would have, for the most part, counted completely on agriculture and cattle.
[time=2128] I mean this was their livelihood.
[time=2130] This is how they fed their families.
[time=2131] This is how they survived.
[time=2134] And Habakkuk says in Habakkuk 3, 17, he says, though the fig tree should not blossom.
[time=2140] And there be no fruit on the vines, none.
[time=2143] Though the yield of the olive should fail and the fields produce no food.
[time=2149] Though the flock should be cut off from the fold and there be no cattle in the stalls at all.
[time=2157] What does he say in verse 18, yet I will exalt in the Lord, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
[time=2165] The Lord God is my strength.
[time=2171] No specific terminology on this one to explain to you.
[time=2176] I'm just going to explain it as simply and clearly as I can.
[time=2180] Here's the takeaway from this passage.
[time=2184] If I end up with nothing, if I end up with whoever I am, whoever you are, if we end up with nothing.
[time=2197] If life doesn't go as planned and the crops and the cattle and the olive tree and the whole nine yards there,
[time=2209] that whole picture has to do with the planting and the watering and the planting that would go into their life.
[time=2217] And he says, if nothing turns out as planned, and every one of you in this room has a hundred of them plans.
[time=2229] If none of them turned out, if I end up with nothing, if what I believe I honestly need, and we're not even talking about want,
[time=2238] we're talking about things that I need, crops, cattle, olives, and that setting and that time.
[time=2245] If what I believe I honestly need isn't provided.
[time=2249] If I'm left then in need, if I'm absolutely desolate, empty, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord is my strength.
[time=2267] The Lord is my strength. I will rejoice in the God of my what? Salvation.
[time=2278] Because my salvation, i.e. my relationship with him, knowing him, being in intimacy with him, being close to him, knowing I have him,
[time=2289] means more to me than anything. Your love is better than life. The Lord is my strength.
[time=2297] Can you repeat that after me? The Lord is my strength. I will rejoice. I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
[time=2311] I hope, I hope you can say that. I hope you can mean that.
[time=2319] You know what we can even go and we will because of time, we can go to the New Testament. Would you turn to Philippians?
[time=2326] Philippians chapter 1, here we don't have the psalmist and we don't have the prophet, here we have the apostle Paul,
[time=2333] writing to the church at Philippi. Go to Philippians 1, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[time=2340] It says there in Philippians 1, 21, it's just a brief little sentence, it's just a powerful little passage,
[time=2346] and Paul in the midst of great trial and great persecution and great torture.
[time=2352] And the threat of great danger says, listen, for me to live, verse 21, for me, the way I'm wired, what God's done to me,
[time=2360] and view of my relationship with him, the way this whole thing works out, for me to live is Christ.
[time=2366] If I live, I get Christ. To live is to walk with him. To live is to be in relationship with him.
[time=2373] For me to live is Christ, and to die is what? Say it, gain. To die, in essence what he's saying,
[time=2380] to live is Christ. If I live, I get Christ. If I die, I just get more of him.
[time=2387] And I've heard it said, and you've heard it said, many a time of the Apostle Paul, you know, they didn't know what to do with him.
[time=2395] They were trying to squelch him, they were trying to thwart him, and there he was, just saying, look, either way we go on this thing. If I live or die, I just simply want more and more of the mall.
[time=2411] I want more and more of my hobby. I want more and more money.
[time=2415] I want more and more prestige and power. I want more and more pleasure. No.
[time=2422] At the end of the day, all I want is more of him. I just want Christ.
[time=2431] I told first hour it reminded me of a song. I don't know when I first heard it.
[time=2437] I forget what church it was at. I forget where I lived. If you heard my story from two weeks ago, you can empathize with my inability to nail it down, but somewhere when I was a kid
[time=2448] in some junior church setting somewhere, they taught me, I want more of Jesus.
[time=2452] More and more and more. I want more of Jesus than I've ever had before.
[time=2459] I want more of his great love, and it goes on and on, and kind of a sing-songy little thing.
[time=2465] You know, it's funny how you get older and you think back on that stuff, set around with friends, and like mocked that song. Not mocked. Hang on, time out.
[time=2473] Not mocked the meaning of the song, but you know, just songs that you sang when you were little, and it was kind of silly, and it just seemed kind of silly, and you know, I want more of Jesus.
[time=2483] I read these things. I read where we've read these last few weeks,
[time=2490] and it's not silly. It's not silly at all.
[time=2495] It's so profound. That's such a great song.
[time=2501] You and I should be. You and I should be singing it every day.
[time=2504] We should be thinking it. We should be moving in that direction.
[time=2507] I want more of Jesus. More and more and more.
[time=2517] Okay, so here we are.
[time=2520] Oh, wait, we're not there yet. Hang on. I was about to give you the question.
[time=2524] No question yet. Go over it. Go over to Philippians 3.
[time=2529] You want to see desire? You want to see priority? You want to see perspective?
[time=2533] Philippians 3.8.
[time=2536] Same thing. In 7 he says, "Whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as what?
[time=2542] Loss for the sake of Christ." Look at 3.8.
[time=2546] More than that, I count all things to be lost.
[time=2549] Everything in view of the surpassing value, the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish the Greek word for manure.
[time=2569] It's the Greek word for excrement.
[time=2573] That's how he viewed all things in comparison to this one thing.
[time=2580] I want more of Jesus.
[time=2584] And count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ.
[time=2590] Matt Chandler said this about this passage.
[time=2594] He said we should talk at length about this text because I think it more than the rest of the text, kind of attacks the evangelical mindset.
[time=2604] And what I mean by that is that Paul says the question we should be asking is not, is it right or is it wrong, which that's the question a lot of us ask.
[time=2614] As he says, most of us perpetually live in the spiritual reality of is this behavior right or is it wrong?
[time=2622] Let me do the correct behavior.
[time=2625] And if the behavior is correct, then we'll do it even at times to our detriment.
[time=2630] Paul says you're asking the wrong question.
[time=2634] The question is not is it right or wrong, but rather does it get me more of Christ?
[time=2641] Or does it rob me of Christ, of my awareness of him?
[time=2646] And that's how he did his life. He would say, listen, I count that as a loss.
[time=2651] I count that as rubbish. I'm not interested in that.
[time=2655] It doesn't matter to me. It's okay. If you do it, when I do it, it robs me.
[time=2660] And so I'll have nothing to do with it.
[time=2665] I count it as dung.
[time=2669] Paul says I want more of Jesus.
[time=2675] More and more and more.
[time=2680] So here we are.
[time=2683] We'll recap and ask the question.
[time=2686] These people, these people panted like a dying animal for more of God.
[time=2700] They were thirsty and hungry for him, and he was in their mind better than life.
[time=2710] They found strength and hope only in him.
[time=2714] They earnestly desperately sought him.
[time=2718] They were destroyed if they couldn't hear from him.
[time=2722] They craved God. They longed to be with God.
[time=2728] Listen, they were desperate for God.
[time=2734] And here's the question.
[time=2737] And as Corbin comes and I think Ben's going to join him and maybe Chris,
[time=2744] as they come, I want to ask you this question and then I'm going to just confess to you.
[time=2747] I've been lying to you. It's not a question. There's actually a few.
[time=2751] And we're going to give you a chance this morning to ask him.
[time=2755] But here's the question.
[time=2758] They craved God.
[time=2761] They longed for him.
[time=2764] They were desperate for God.
[time=2767] And the question is why aren't you?
[time=2774] How's come I'm not? Come, we're not characterized by a desperateness for him.
[time=2785] And I'm going to just ask you some questions here and I just invite you to just however you listen best.
[time=2791] Maybe you just want to look at me and you can listen that way.
[time=2794] Maybe you want to bow your heads and listen that way.
[time=2797] But here's some questions in light of this great truth over the last two weeks for you and I to consider.
[time=2803] Why are we thankful for God but not desperate for him?
[time=2813] Why is he literally down toward the bottom of your list when it comes to that which you crave?
[time=2823] Can't live without.
[time=2826] I've got to have it. And I've got to have it now.
[time=2831] How does he get down toward the bottom of that list?
[time=2836] You know, here's maybe the clearest way of asking this. Why?
[time=2850] Why when I could have so much of him, do I settle for so little?
[time=2865] Why church would we ever be content with this?
[time=2871] This world of ours, these options, these little G gods, why are we so content?
[time=2879] Why does, why does full fledged fully expressed on adulterated passion for God when you and I bump into those individuals periodically?
[time=2891] Why does it leave us at times more uncomfortable than inspired?
[time=2902] Why do most of us in the room sleep just fine?
[time=2907] If you weren't here last week, that's just a question in reference to the Psalmist who, his sleep's interrupted by thoughts of God, he's mindful of God on the night watches.
[time=2917] So taken by him and so consumed with him. Why does the church, why does the church at times seem so unmoved, so not stirred by these types of longings and pursuits?
[time=2935] Why do you just sit there week after week?
[time=2942] And nothing seems to ever really change.
[time=2949] To quote C.S. Lewis, why do we settle for playing in a muddy puddle when we could enjoy swimming in the vast blue depths of the sea?
[time=2964] Why are so many of us so willing to live in this short-lived thrill and subsequent emptiness of sin, life without God, rather than bask in the joy and peace of intimacy with him?
[time=2987] Why would we ever nibble to quote John Piper?
[time=2993] Why would we ever nibble the table of the world and pass on the feast which is Christ?
[time=3016] Why is this us?
[time=3021] A question that rarely gets asked.
[time=3026] And I want to just this morning as you listen to Corbin and Ben and Chris, I want to give you the chance to just echo the lyrics of the song.
[time=3037] I want to give you the chance to just admit to God this morning that you don't long for him, that you don't crave him, that you don't yearn for him, and you want to.
[time=3051] I'd invite you this morning to just say that to him, that you want to, you really, really do, and that you need his help, that you need his insight, you need his touch, you need his guidance, something's going to have to change.
[time=3067] And for the record that comes with the answer, which will be next week, but this morning would you just cry out to him?
[time=3074] Would you identify with the lyrics of the song and would you now in your seat right here?
[time=3078] We got time. Would you just beg him to meet you in this place and to move you to being one who longs and craves and pants and yearns?
[time=3101] Lord, I want a yearn for you. I want to burn with passion over you.
[time=3132] And only you, Lord, I want a yearn.
[time=3148] Your joy is mine.
[time=3167] Singing, bringing grace.
[time=3176] And I'd love him. I want a yearn for you. I want to burn with passion over you.
[time=3231] I want to burn with passion over you. And only you, Lord, I want a yearn for you. I want to burn with passion over you.
[time=3255] And only you, Lord, I want a yearn for you. I want to burn with passion over you.
[time=3271] And only you, Lord, I want a yearn.
[time=3296] Maybe if you could just, right where you're sitting, just bow your heads and close your eyes if you wouldn't, just for a moment.
[time=3304] You know, there are many, many of you in the room this morning. And you're connecting with this message.
[time=3312] And you are being stirred because there's so many of you who know what it's like to have been at a place of intimacy with him.
[time=3322] You've fully surrendered your heart and life to him and so there have been, there has been a time and then there have been subsequent time since where you've tasted of his goodness.
[time=3332] Where you've lived in that intimate place where you have longed for him and craved him and he's met you there and filled you up and you know what that's like.
[time=3344] And you've wandered from that. You have strayed from that and so we talk about questions like this to bring us back to a place of truth and realization and we're going to keep going next week.
[time=3359] But I want to say this, there may be some of you in the room this morning, there may be some of you watching on the broadcast, there may be others listening online.
[time=3368] And here's what I want to say to you, you may not have ever yet fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=3378] And while you've been listening to this over the last couple of weeks, your heart has been stirred and my friend, that's the spirit of God.
[time=3386] And you're beginning to realize that all you're searching and all you're seeking leads to this, to him.
[time=3394] Oh, you know all about craving and you know all about longing, you've just been going to all the wrong places and trying to find it and all the wrong stuff.
[time=3405] And so this morning I want to give you a chance, whoever you might be, to right here in the quietness of your own heart and soul before him, come to know him.
[time=3415] And would you just in the quietness of your heart, if that's you today and you want to make that step, would you just say these words, these simple words? Oh God.
[time=3425] Oh God, my sin has separated me from you.
[time=3430] And oh God, thank you for your son, that you would send him to die and defeat death on my behalf.
[time=3441] Oh God, thank you, that you're willing to save me.
[time=3447] I need to be saved.
[time=3451] Oh God, my heart longs for you.
[time=3454] I didn't know it was you, but now I do.
[time=3457] My heart longs for you.
[time=3460] And oh God, thank you for hearing my prayer, for saving me.
[time=3467] And oh God, please would you grow me now to be one who finds life in you.
[time=3474] Quench my thirst, satisfy my hunger.
[time=3479] Oh my God.
[time=3482] Lord, I am here for you, I am here with passion over you.
[time=3511] I am here for you, I am here for you.
