[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well good morning everyone and welcome again to Blackhawk on the Run.
[time=35] I'm excited today for the first time ever in the Blackhawk on the Run studio.
[time=40] We've got our senior pastor, Kelly Bird.
[time=41] So I'd love to introduce him to any, don't know who you are.
[time=45] I think they know who you are.
[time=46] - Well, thank you.
[time=47] It's good to be with all of you and Corbin, thank you for letting me be on Blackhawk on the run.
[time=52] - It's fine. - Finally, yeah.
[time=53] Maybe we should do this more often.
[time=56] I'm glad that you're here because Blackhawk, I wanted Kelly to begin a conversation that we'd like to have with you today in regard to some changes coming up this December for Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=66] So why don't you get us started and then I'll fill in some details.
[time=69] - I'll do my best. - Okay.
[time=70] You know, for the last couple of years, we have made a very big deal about trying to, as not only individuals, but as a ministry, we've been trying to follow Jesus.
[time=80] We've been trying to proclaim a message and encourage you as a family to be about one thing.
[time=88] And that is modeling your life and all of us modeling this ministry after the ways of Jesus.
[time=94] And when you study the scriptures, especially the gospels, you realize something very quickly, Jesus and his ministry, Jesus in his life.
[time=102] He was very, very intentional and it was very simple.
[time=106] He wasn't busy, he wasn't scattered.
[time=109] And so as we think about that, over the last several years, our leadership has come to this place where we've wanted to say to you, look, we don't want you busy and scattered.
[time=118] Be about three things.
[time=120] Be about the gathering.
[time=122] Be about connecting and please be about going.
[time=126] And we've tried to, in recent days, take all of our ministry efforts and kind of hone and refine them.
[time=133] We've tried to kind of bring them in and say, just be about these things.
[time=137] And we realized Corbin and I, as we started to talk about Christmas, that there was some real application opportunity here.
[time=144] And so we've taken CWB and even kind of in a further way, connected it to one of those three main things, specifically the gathering.
[time=154] And I want Corbin to explain to you how that is going to look and why that, why it's something we're so excited about.
[time=160] - Yeah, in your bulletin today, you're going to see this brochure that kind of explains a little bit about what the format of Christmas with Blackhawk will be.
[time=168] Trying to take everything that was always really good about Christmas with Blackhawk in that weekend performance and just diffusing it out into the entire month of December.
[time=177] Looking at doing an event on the first Sunday of that month where the kids get highlighted in a production called Meet Me at the Major.
[time=183] The following week, we're asking any actors and actresses in the room to just give their time and energy to a one-act drama that Sunday.
[time=191] The following week will be a musical concert event where we'll have worship with our choir and orchestra.
[time=197] And then leading up to Christmas morning on Christmas Eve, just like we always gather for communion, we're gonna do the story of Christmas that night and present that.
[time=207] It's all outlined in here and we just want you to know, as you head toward December, that you won't be inviting your friends and family and coworkers to a weekend performance, but you'll be inviting them to your Sunday morning gathering time with Children's Ministry and with a message by Pastor Bird and kind of a more of a typical experience at Blackhawk, but super infused with Christmas arts, drama and kids and choirs and orchestras.
[time=231] So that's the big shift.
[time=233] - And we're looking forward to it.
[time=235] We are looking forward to what God's gonna do in our gathering.
[time=238] And that's the thing, the people that you invite get to come and not be a part of something that's unique and different.
[time=245] They get to be a part of something that's regular and normal for us, our Sunday morning gathering and we can't wait to share that experience with them.
[time=253] - My hope and dream is that people would just come to each of the events and before they know it, they're just used to waking up on Sundays and being with us.
[time=261] And we see them again in January and we see them again in February and we get the chance to not just see them for one night, but hopefully invest in them over a long period of time.
[time=269] - Well said.
[time=270] - Real quick before we go, I just wanted you to know how you can help and how you can be involved.
[time=274] Right now in particular, we're looking for actors and actresses and kids and singers and orchestra members and artists and all the information on how you can serve in the artistic fashion is listed right here in this brochure.
[time=287] Also want you to know there'll be other ways for the church family to be involved, but we're not going to share those with you right now.
[time=292] Right now we just need the artists to come and then later on in the year, probably next month, we'll fill you in on some other ways that you can serve and be involved in this unique endeavor to serve people.
[time=301] - That's good.
[time=302] That's good. Hey, I want to just say to you before we sign off, when you watch this, as you're watching this, I'm across the world in a vulnerable Russia with Jason Mayley, one of our elders, spending a week with an amazing group of 30 church planters who are giving their lives to the spread of the gospel and the furthering of the kingdom.
[time=322] So pray for Jason and I, pray for those dear, dear men, pray that God will bless and anoint our time and I can't wait to get back and be with you and tell you all about what God did and how he moved.
[time=334] - Yeah.
[time=335] In addition to what we said today, there's lots of information in your bulletin.
[time=338] Please pick it up and read it about things going on in our church life.
[time=342] And if there's anything that we've talked about today that you'd like to see again, you can always go to our website where you click on us.

[time=769] God of endings who will leave no song unended.
[time=777] [APPLAUSE]
[time=786] Hey, would you just take a moment and would you just from the bottom of your heart in light of all the work and the preparation and the heart put into it would you think Corbin and Corey and Becky and John Newmeister for all that they have brought?
[time=806] Hey, what a week, what a two weeks we've had as a family.
[time=812] Looking at the Word of God and taking a look at those who have hungered and thirsted and
[time=819] craved and panted after God.
[time=823] Your responses have been amazing.
[time=825] It's been so encouraging to see God at work.
[time=827] I think maybe in a way the first two weeks, these last two weeks kind of got summarized
[time=833] for me over the weekend.
[time=835] It's been a great weekend, a weekend that my wife and I and our oldest son Russell have
[time=841] thoroughly enjoyed.
[time=842] I actually left a little early last night and came home so I could be with you this morning but we've been up at Michigan State where he's going to go next year as a student and basketball player.
[time=853] What they do on the recruiting front is, you know, all the visits that you take in the recruiting process prior to a kid's senior year are called unofficial visits and that's
[time=864] just a nice way of saying mom and dad pay for them.
[time=868] When the kid becomes a senior then you get to do what's called an official visit where they pick one weekend and this past weekend was it for us where they bring the recruit on campus.
[time=878] It's all on their dime.
[time=879] They put you up in the nicest hotel and they take you out to dinner one night at a really nice restaurant.
[time=885] The next night we were at, last night we were at Coach Izzo's House Saturday, Michigan, Michigan State football game, it was just an incredible experience and we were really encouraged so thankful for that staff and those people up there and the opportunity we believe Russell's going to have in the days to come but it was really interesting Saturday morning.
[time=906] We got up for the game.
[time=907] It was a noon game.
[time=909] We were with other recruits and all the coaching staff and families.
[time=912] We were going to tailgate at the coach's office.
[time=915] They put up a tent outside Izzo's office and they grill up the brats and the burgers and they've got big flat screens everywhere playing Michigan State videos and past final fours.
[time=926] It's really a lot of fun.
[time=928] We had to walk from the hotel over to the campus, not a far walk, to the Breslin Center,
[time=934] the main arena there where the coach's offices are and it was just incredible, nine in the morning we started out and between the hotel and the arena, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[time=944] of tents already up with people already drinking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of gallons
[time=952] of, you know, you name it.
[time=953] We're walking by nine in the morning, no kidding, tables just, actually I went to my car real quick to get Kebra some something she had left in my car which was in the parking garage and the parking garage there were 150 people in front of my car with tables up and grills going and vodka and rum and sweet and sour mix you name it, I mean it was just flowing,
[time=973] nine a.m. and we walked to the arena just hundreds of tents and people already just diving in and already getting a little rowdy, already getting a little out of hand, not too bad.
[time=984] Not all of the tailgates were of that nature, I'm not trying to demonize tailgating.
[time=988] We had one here a few weeks ago for baptism, it was awesome.
[time=991] I'm just saying it was really, really happening on that front.
[time=995] We get to the arena, we have our tailgate party where they didn't have a lot of booze
[time=1001] at ours but we finished it about 11, 15 and then we began to walk, they do this walk from
[time=1008] the coaches office over to the football stadium and coaches on the staff and all the players, current and all the future players and families, we just do this walk right through campus and now there's just thousands of people, hundreds, hundreds of more tents and more and more and
[time=1025] more kegs that are tapped and bottles that are getting poured and I'm telling you it's
[time=1031] just that the energy is getting heightened and people are starting to go over the edge and they're yelling and screaming mostly nice things and we get to the game and the game's an incredible game and it goes from about 12 to 2 through about 12 to 3 o'clock and at 3 o'clock we start to make the walk back to the arena, well at that time thousands of people are literally running from the stadium back to their tents where they will now continue
[time=1056] along that road from about 3, one guy told me from about 3 to 10 p.m. they'll just ratchet
[time=1063] it up a notch and more kegs will get tapped and more bottles will get poured and on and
[time=1069] on and on they'll go so we walk right through the middle of that, Russell was just kind of taking all this in, we get back to the arena, we talk for a while, he wants to work out so we work out there at the arena for about an hour and a half lifts, shoots, kever goes back to the hotel, he and I hour and a half later now make our way out of the arena back to the hotel and by this time now it is absolutely through the ceiling, now nobody's gone home,
[time=1092] it seems like there's more people there than when we came that way at 9 and now the energy
[time=1098] level is just through the ceiling and he looks at me as we're walking through all this and
[time=1104] he's seen this before, it's not blowing his circuits, he's just seeing it again up close
[time=1110] and he looks at me and he says why do they do that and I was thinking about it last night
[time=1117] driving home, I gave him a correct but very boring theological answer, I really missed
[time=1124] the moment because what I should have said to him is they're thirsty and you can kind
[time=1136] of laugh because yeah they're kind of thirsty you know physically but you know what I mean,
[time=1144] they're thirsty and we have for two weeks now allowed the scriptures on the other side
[time=1154] of that coin to paint for us a picture of those who panted not for a keg but for God,
[time=1165] they craved God, they longed and yearned for him and him alone, they were utterly desperate
[time=1176] to hear from God and to be with him in his presence and so we came to the place last
[time=1182] week where we individually and as a family with great courage asked the question, we
[time=1189] finally got to the question, they panted, they longed, they craved, they yearned for him,
[time=1196] why don't we, why are we satisfied, as John Piper said with the crumbs of this world instead
[time=1208] of the feast offered in Christ, why are we content with so little of God when we could
[time=1216] have so much more of him?
[time=1222] We asked the question, why are we grateful and so many of us in the room would raise our hands immediately if I asked you, are you, you would say yes I'm grateful, why are we grateful but not desperate for him?
[time=1238] These were the questions we asked and I want to just say I used the word courage earlier,
[time=1245] as a family with great courage we asked the question, I say courage because I really believe most of you as we've kind of made our way over these two weeks, most of you kind of knew the question and as we asked the question last week I think a lot of you knew that the
[time=1260] answer, it's kind of like a tumor biopsy that gets sent off to pathology and you just
[time=1269] have this feeling, you just know it's not going to be good and I say courage because
[time=1277] I think many of you were willing to ask a very difficult question and you knew in your heart like I knew in my heart that the answer, I kind of feel like the doctor this morning
[time=1288] gathering the family in the waiting room delivering the news, hey guys the results aren't so good
[time=1299] and you know what the answer to the question, why don't you pant, why don't I crave him,
[time=1307] why don't I yearn and hunger and thirst for him at a desperate level, the answer, it's
[time=1313] not so good, the answer to why aren't you desperate for God is you don't need him, you've convinced
[time=1328] yourself of this, that you at least at that level don't need him, the answer to why don't
[time=1342] you pant for God like a dying deer trying desperately to get to a stream, is you know
[time=1349] what, you're not that thirsty, you're just not, you're just not that thirsty at least
[time=1361] you don't think you are, you think you're all right and as I say these words and as you
[time=1372] look at those answers on the screen most of us in the room kind of say to ourselves wow you know what, that's really true, I mean truth be told in all honesty before God, are
[time=1389] we right or are we wrong, I think we're right, I think we're hitting right on the head,
[time=1397] you don't need him, I'm not that thirsty and so you sit there like I sit there and you're
[time=1407] kind of scratch your head and you go wow, hey that's really true, be how in the world,
[time=1414] how that happened, how did I get here, because that's true and I want to show you, I want
[time=1424] God's Word to show you how that happened, how you and I got there, turn with me if you
[time=1430] would, go to the book of Jeremiah, just after the book of Isaiah I think right before Ezekiel
[time=1440] go to Jeremiah, I'll be finding the Lamentations is in there, but go to Jeremiah 2 would you,
[time=1451] Jeremiah chapter 2, I want you to look at verse 13, here the prophet Jeremiah, God reveals
[time=1462] through him this message, God brings clarity to why this very thing could be said of the
[time=1469] nation of Israel, it says in Jeremiah 2 13, it says for my people have committed two evils
[time=1478] and you could just write one and two, notes today would be very easy, just write one and
[time=1485] then below one just write two on your on your notes sheet and then you can just fill this in as we go, for my people have committed two evils, they have forsaken me the fountain
[time=1496] of living waters, to hue or dig for themselves cisterns, wells if you will, to hue or to
[time=1507] dig for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that don't work, that can hold, know what,
[time=1514] say it, and you understand water here, you understand it's analogous to the provision
[time=1521] of God, we're talking about that place deep in your heart and soul, deep in my heart and soul where God in that relationship with him, when there's intimacy there, we're talking about that provision, that meeting, that coming together, that blessing, that encouragement,
[time=1536] that presence of God in the deepest part of you, that water that brings life, you with
[time=1542] me, this is the water that the scripture, the passage here refers to.
[time=1549] So two things have happened that lead you and I to this place of going, you know what the truth is, as sad and tragic as it is, I don't need him and I'm not that thirsty.
[time=1559] And here's the first thing, they forsook God, you can write that down, they forsook God.
[time=1567] They had come to a place where they had finally forsaken God, what do we mean?
[time=1572] Though he was the promised fountain of living water, they didn't like the pace of his provision,
[time=1580] they didn't like the scope of his provision, they didn't like the smell, they didn't like
[time=1586] the taste, they didn't like the color, they didn't like, I mean, you know the nation of Israel, they just got to the point where they just didn't like what he provided and they
[time=1598] looked around at other nations and all that they possessed and they wanted, they wanted what they had, and do you and I do the same thing, don't we?
[time=1611] We want what they have.
[time=1613] I know you provide, I know you're the fountain of living water, but I want what they have.
[time=1620] Plus, not only do they want what they had, not only were they upset with the scope and
[time=1626] the pace of God's provision, but as you read the story of the Israelites, the whole faith thing was getting difficult for them.
[time=1633] This nebulous God that they couldn't touch or control was getting hard for them and so
[time=1641] they left, says it right there, they forsook him, they left God.
[time=1647] They exchanged living water, think about it, they exchanged living water, God's provision
[time=1653] and God's time and place and the worship of God and the desire for God, they swap it out,
[time=1659] they just swap it out for what?
[time=1661] For Baal worship, for Asherah polls, the mixed young audience here, I won't get into what
[time=1671] took place at the Asherah polls, a lot of what goes on today at polls.
[time=1682] God sacrifices, immorality, greed and graven images.
[time=1691] They swap out God, the living water, because they don't like the scope and the pace of
[time=1697] his provision, plus the faith thing is getting a little nebulous and hard.
[time=1700] We want to touch something and control it.
[time=1705] And so they exchange it for Baal worship and Asherah polls and child sacrifices.
[time=1712] I said first hour, it reminded me, turn there to Romans 1, it reminds me of what it says in Romans 1.
[time=1717] My goodness, listen to the wording here in Romans 1, 21, here talking about the, not
[time=1724] just necessarily the Israelites, here we're just talking about the natural progression of sinful man, how sad it is, for even though look at 21, for even though they knew God,
[time=1736] which is an amazing statement, even though they knew him, even though they were aware of his provision, even though they knew he was this fountain of living water, they did
[time=1745] not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile.
[time=1749] This is where it leads, it leads to futility in our thinking.
[time=1752] They became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was what darkened, professing
[time=1759] to be wise, they became fools and there it is, and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible
[time=1767] God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and forefooted animals and
[time=1776] crawling creatures.
[time=1778] They forsook God.
[time=1782] You and I, you and I have at some level, I believe, forsaken God.
[time=1793] Secondly, the passage in Jeremiah 2 tells us that they dug for themselves, they hewed
[time=1801] broken cisterns, there's your second thing to write down, they dug broken cisterns.
[time=1809] Now make no mistake, please understand this, they knew they needed water, right?
[time=1816] They knew they needed water.
[time=1818] They knew they needed provision at the deepest level of their soul in order to live.
[time=1825] They just figured they could find another brand, elsewhere, which is so tragic.
[time=1836] It's really, really sad because that same God said in Isaiah 55, "Oh please, oh please
[time=1844] don't do that." Isaiah 55, go back to turn your bibles, go back in your Old Testament, go past, go before
[time=1853] Jeremiah to Isaiah 55.
[time=1858] And it says in Isaiah 55, "God seeing the tendency of man to go towards cisterns that
[time=1866] don't hold water.
[time=1867] God seeing the tendency in you and I to try and look for other places where we can find
[time=1873] this provision." God says to the people of Israel and God says to you and I today, look at that first word in Isaiah 55.1, it says, "Oh, that word means stop."
[time=1887] That word means no, no, no, no, don't go any further, stop where you're going, don't take another step, "Oh," he says, "Everyone who thirsts, come to the, here it is, come
[time=1899] to the waters, and you who have no money, come by and eat, come by wine and milk without
[time=1908] money and without cost, I'll give it to you." Why do you spend money for that?
[time=1916] Why do you spend money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not satisfy?
[time=1922] Listen carefully to me and eat what is good and delight yourself in abundance.
[time=1928] Well, what is that?
[time=1932] Verse 3, "Incline your ear and come to who?" Say it out loud, church, to me.
[time=1940] Incline your ear and come to me, listen, and he puts it right on the line here, listen
[time=1947] that you may what live because if you don't listen and if you don't get this straight,
[time=1954] you're going to what?
[time=1958] You're going to die.
[time=1962] But instead, Israel has a better plan.
[time=1969] They erect these idols all over their lives.
[time=1973] They buy into the live that the idol can meet them at their deepest need, that the idol
[time=1979] can produce or provide water, which it can't, and so they inevitably slowly begin to die.
[time=1986] The further and further removed they get from his and his alone presence.
[time=1997] And I found this heartbreaking.
[time=1999] I found it interesting, but I just found it sad that God actually says to all this, go back to Jeremiah 2, if you will.
[time=2008] God actually says in Jeremiah 2, "Are you kidding me?
[time=2013] You and I say that all the time.
[time=2015] Are you kidding me?" God actually says, "Who does this?
[time=2021] Are you kidding me?
[time=2024] What are you thinking?" God actually says this.
[time=2028] They wear.
[time=2029] Jeremiah 2, 10, and 11, 4.
[time=2031] He says, "Cross over, go to the coastlands of Kitim and see, and send to Qadar and observe
[time=2037] closely and see if there has been such a thing as this that a nation changed God's."
[time=2048] When they were not God's, but my people, God says, "My people have changed their glory.
[time=2054] They have exchanged me." What does the text say?
[time=2060] For that which does not profit.
[time=2068] Here's the question, my friends.
[time=2072] I told you a week ago, there wasn't really one.
[time=2076] There's a few.
[time=2077] Here's another one.
[time=2078] And this one gets right to it.
[time=2081] Who exchanges God's?
[time=2086] Who swaps out God for an ash or a pole?
[time=2092] You know who does?
[time=2093] You know who exchanges God's idolaters is what the Scripture says, idolaters.
[time=2101] Why don't we crave God?
[time=2103] Why aren't we desperate for Him?
[time=2105] Because my friends, we, so many of us in the room this morning, have come to the real
[time=2111] realization that we are idolaters.
[time=2117] We have committed and we keep committing idolatry.
[time=2121] Now, it's usually kind of a slow burn, doesn't happen all at once, this full-fledged idolatry.
[time=2130] It's usually kind of a slow burn, but we get there.
[time=2133] We know, we know even though they knew God.
[time=2136] We know cognitively, we know He's the living water.
[time=2142] But be it our fleshly impatience, fleshly impatience, Israel, I don't like the pace
[time=2150] of His provision.
[time=2151] I don't like the scope of His provision.
[time=2153] I want what they want now.
[time=2157] Be it our fleshly impatience or be it our fleshly desires, our sinful desires.
[time=2164] I can, look, I can smoke it, drink it, swallow it, eat it, purchase it, own it, click on
[time=2172] it, build it or drive it, and guess what, I feel better now.
[time=2182] I built my little image and I can control how I feel and what I get, so boom, be it my
[time=2188] fleshly impatience or my fleshly desires, listen, we gradually get to a point where
[time=2196] whatever it is that we've locked on to has become our God.
[time=2204] And guess what we pant for then?
[time=2209] Is it God or is it it?
[time=2213] Answer, it.
[time=2216] Oh, we pant, oh, we thirst and we long and we yearn too many times for it.
[time=2228] And for clarity's sake, what's it?
[time=2233] What are these idols that we worship?
[time=2237] What are your idols that you pay more attention to and think more about than God?
[time=2245] These idols that you run to, to feel better, these idols that you run to, to look better,
[time=2251] to get more of what you want, these idols that you find security in.
[time=2257] These idols that you find significance in.
[time=2261] These idols that you think bring you comfort and love.
[time=2267] Scripture says, God's Word says this God who loves you and made you in his image, this God who longs for relationship with you, said I'm worthy of your worship.
[time=2279] Think about me, I'll bring you comfort, I'll bring you security, I'll bring you significance,
[time=2285] but we say no, no, no, we need a different brand, we want what they have now.
[time=2293] And so we turn to modern, modern day idols.
[time=2298] What are some modern day, what are some modern day idols?
[time=2304] I just, I just wrote a few things down.
[time=2308] A martini or four, a night at the strip club, drugs, an illicit relationship, a relationship
[time=2320] outside of the loving parameters of God's design, a pornographic website, and in case
[time=2333] anyone in the room just let out a silent little sigh of relief thinking, whoo, man, I'm glad
[time=2341] that's not me, the list does go on, more clothes, hobbies, excessive spending, spending that
[time=2356] would really go beyond need, travel, maybe too much, comfortable lifestyle, you could
[time=2367] put safety in there, the demand for it, better home, better car, better hair, better toys,
[time=2381] pleasure, private or public, more money so you can circle back at the top and keep doing
[time=2394] all the above.
[time=2398] Now you look at that, you go hold on, martinis and strip clubs and drugs, excessive spending,
[time=2404] comfortable lifestyle, better homes, it may sound or look like I just made a wealthy person's
[time=2410] list and a poor person's list, not at all, two things, I want you to keep in mind here.
[time=2419] I know a lot of very wealthy people who worship pornography.
[time=2424] I know a lot of very wealthy people who worship illicit relationships and I know a lot of really
[time=2432] poor people who worship, I'm going to have a home dock on it, I'm going to have a home
[time=2440] one day and I don't care what it takes, what I got to do, I'm going to have something that's going to be mine, you know what I'm saying there?
[time=2449] I know both, please understand idolatry has no socioeconomic bias, it affects everybody
[time=2458] at every level and secondly, and this is what I really want you to catch, and secondly,
[time=2464] I know a lot of people, I know a lot of people who have homes, cars, clothes, amazing vacation
[time=2473] destinations, and I know a lot of people who don't have any of that, but what they do have,
[time=2483] both sides, what they do have, they do this with.
[time=2490] I want everybody in the room to kind of, and this might take a little while, so I want you to, you can rest your elbow, I know you're not as muscular as I am, your arm might get tired, I want you to put your hand out in front of you, right now everybody, put your hand out in front of you, you can rest it on your leg if it's going to get tired, but I really want you to do this, put your hand out in front of you and spread your palm open wide, I know a lot of people who, with what they desire, and there's nothing evil
[time=2514] necessarily or wrong with some of those desires, nothing wrong with me wanting to house my
[time=2521] family, there's nothing wrong with you and I, nothing wrong with me wanting a week away with my wife and kids, there's nothing, there's nothing wrong with some of the things that you and I desire, but here's what happens, I know a lot of people who, as they desire
[time=2537] these things and as God provides, they keep all that in the palm of their hand and their
[time=2543] hand is left, what, open.
[time=2546] They know God is the fountain of living water, they live as best they can and they
[time=2552] bring it out and they want to be with him and they want to find life in him and yes
[time=2565] they have some desires and whatever he gives or provides they hold, how's your arm doing, keep it right there in an open hand, but here's what happens, that's not so good, is that
[time=2577] many times you and I with these desires that we have and these things that we'd
[time=2583] like and sometimes God provides them and sometimes we manipulate circumstances to get them but what happens is we do this go ahead and make a fist and keep it there
[time=2594] look at it look at that fist real quick look at go back open look at that just
[time=2600] look at that that says that says humility that says submission that says I'm open
[time=2606] that says it's not really mine make a fist look at that look at your fist it
[time=2613] says you know what it says it says stay away this is who's mine whatever that
[time=2621] is martinis strip clubs drugs cars homes closed doesn't matter it's mine and I
[time=2630] read this this week I read it from a guy down in Texas and he was talking about
[time=2636] this very thing and he made such a profound but simple point keep that fist he said you know what happens keep it right there in front of you he says you know what happens so many times we've done this and what idolatry is and and back to the question why don't we crave him and why don't we want to be near him and why don't we why we thirsty for him and why don't we why don't we desperate to be in his presence how's your fist keep it up there because so many times we know down deep in our hearts that if we get close to him with
[time=2667] this he may want what's inside we don't want him to have what's inside we want
[time=2677] what's inside and we hold on to it tightly and if I get too close to you you're gonna want to take what I'm holding on to and I don't want you to take it because I want it because I'm not happy with the pace of your provision and I don't like the scope of it and I want what they have now and I finally got it and here's the crazy thing keep it right there here's the
[time=2702] crazy thing the crazy thing this friend pointed this out in between services today anything that you hold on to that once may have been beautiful and big and
[time=2712] and attractive and full of life anything that you hold on to that tightly for that long with a close fist with no air getting in and no other resources coming
[time=2723] in slowly dies and it rots and it stinks and it permeates and it's horrible and
[time=2742] God says God says you should do something just watch this nobody keep it up there
[time=2749] for a little bit longer nobody ever myself included ever keeps it out here you know what we do with those things that we clutch on to so tightly do that
[time=2760] but right there we put it into our what our hearts and God's word says turn with
[time=2768] me to Ezekiel Corbin you can come up as I read this and Lindsay listen to this
[time=2774] my friends look at Ezekiel 14 it's just so convicting and so sad and so hopeful
[time=2780] all at the same time look at 14 Ezekiel 14 one to three then some elders of
[time=2791] Israel were back at Israel again same problem same situation came to me and
[time=2797] sat down before me Ezekiel writing here and the word of the Lord came to me
[time=2803] saying it's Corbin plays listen to this listen son of man these men have set up
[time=2813] their idols in their everybody say it out loud hearts have set up their idols
[time=2821] in their hearts and have put right before their faces the stumbling block of
[time=2829] their iniquity they've they've taken what they've gripped so tightly they've brought it into their hearts and as you bring it into your heart you then commit to putting it right in front of your face the stumbling block that leads you and I to sin and iniquity should I be consulted by them at all and you and I
[time=2852] read that this morning and if you're if you're hard if your spiritual hearts halfway alive today you with me you hear all of this and you just say oh God
[time=2866] it's so true what should I do and God's word says in verse six what to do God
[time=2878] says therefore say to the house of Israel thus says the Lord God and I want
[time=2885] everybody in the room this morning to out loud say that one word right now say it say a louder repent many of you know what the word repent means the scripture
[time=2897] here self-defines but it means to see and agree with God about the sin and not
[time=2905] just to see it and agree with him but to then turn and go not in a sort of different direction but in a completely different direction God's word says
[time=2917] repent and turn away from your idols and turn your faces away from all your
[time=2926] abominations all that those idols bring I'll say it to you this morning my
[time=2933] friends and all my years of studying this book and all my years of life and all my years of ministry I can tell you that idolatry leads to ruin it just does it
[time=2947] leads to ruin and so God says repent before Lindsay sings I want to read you
[time=2956] this quote my good friend Steve Webster passed it on to me this week from John Piper and it just reads like this just listen fight for us oh God that we not
[time=2967] drift numb and blind and foolish into vain and empty excitements life is too
[time=2973] short too precious too painful to waste on worldly bubbles that burst
[time=2980] heaven is too great hell is too horrible eternity is too long that we
[time=2986] should putter around on the porch of eternity and yet that's what we do so
[time=2996] many times we putter around on the porch of eternity when in reality we should
[time=3004] be longing and yearning for him and I want you to listen as Lindsay sings I believe the words to this song really do describe what I think is at the heart
[time=3015] and soul of so many of us in the room this morning who know him we we want this
[time=3021] we really do and I believe God's willing to bring you and I to this place and on
[time=3028] but I believe it starts with you and I crying out to him these these very things
[time=3034] Lindsay sing for us. This is the air I breathe. This is the air I breathe. Your holy presence. Living in me.
[time=3064] This is my daily prayer. This is my daily prayer.
[time=3083] Your very way. Spoken to me and my high. I'm desperate for you.
[time=3110] In the high. I'm lost without you.
[time=3125] This is the air I breathe. This is the air I breathe.
[time=3140] Your holy presence. Living in me.
[time=3153] This is my daily prayer. This is my daily prayer.
[time=3169] Your very way. Spoken to me and my high.
[time=3188] I'm desperate for you.
[time=3196] In the high. I'm lost without you.
[time=3210] In the high. I'm desperate for you.
[time=3224] In the high. I'm so lost without you.
[time=3234] I'm lost without you.
[time=3252] I'm nothing without you.
[time=3278] As Corbin plays let me just ask you to just bow your heads for a moment would you?
[time=3281] Every one of you. Let me just encourage you. If you think you're something without him,
[time=3291] if you think you're not lost without him, you keep going and I hope and I pray and I believe he'll
[time=3309] in time show you otherwise. He sure has me and I want to just remind you we've been talking about
[time=3319] the answer to the question. The answer we may not want to hear we're idolaters my friends to the
[time=3330] question that rarely gets asked. Why don't we pant after God? I want to just remind you we didn't
[time=3340] get this far in Romans 1 but I want to read this to you. Here's where this goes. You're not lost
[time=3350] without him. You actually think you might be somebody without him. You want to stay with idolatry.
[time=3359] You want to keep swapping him out? Therefore, verse 24, "God gave them over in the lusts of
[time=3365] their hearts. God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity so that their bodies
[time=3374] would be dishonored among them for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served
[time=3384] the creature rather than the who. Say it, the Creator who was blessed forever. Amen. Would you stand with me?
[time=3394] As you stand, let me just invite you back next week. Boy, we're going to keep going here. You just
[time=3402] don't want to miss next week as we come to God's Word again and have this picture painted for us
[time=3410] of what repentance really looks like. There's some things that have gone wrong in your thinking and
[time=3416] mine and it needs to be corrected if we're to turn and go in a different direction. So you don't want to miss it. Come back next week and be a part of that. Oh Father God, we stand before you this morning
[time=3427] and we pray, O God, for your mercy and we pray, O God, for your strength and courage. We want
[time=3435] to be so many of us desperate for you. Oh God, we know that panting and longing and hungering and
[time=3442] thirsting after you is the only way that our hearts and souls will ever be filled up. So God,
[time=3451] would you begin? Would you begin this week the work of repentance in us? Would you begin to give
[time=3458] us the strength and courage to hear and see the truth and move toward it and away from our sin
[time=3464] away from little gee gods that don't hold water and can't bring life? Father God, thank you for
[time=3472] your truth that we've been able to be reminded of today. God be with us as we go and all the people
[time=3480] in the room agreed and said amen.
[time=3494] you
