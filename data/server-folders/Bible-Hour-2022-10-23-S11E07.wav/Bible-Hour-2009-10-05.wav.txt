[time=298] - God in heaven our hearts agree with these prayerful lyrics
[time=307] to decrease while you increase in our lives and to bow down low and lift you high.
[time=315] God may it be so in our midst, may we approach you with fear and with reverence and with great humility.
[time=322] You are the God who made the lands and the seas and the God who fashioned each one of us and did us together in our mother's womb.
[time=329] You are the God that knows the words we say before we speak them and the God that knows the future.
[time=334] And so we humbly submit to your reign and your rule and we declare you to be king of kings and Lord of lords.
[time=341] Forgive us God and have mercy on us
[time=348] for the ways that we prioritize other things and other people and other gods above you.
[time=354] We repent and we confess you to be the one true God.
[time=358] We pray and sing all of these things in the name of your son Jesus, amen.
[time=364] - It is my great joy and privilege and blessing
[time=371] to serve the families of Black Caught Christian School day after day.
[time=375] We have the best families and the best kids anywhere.
[time=377] We'll stack them up against anybody.
[time=380] I'll stack our soccer team up against anybody too because they won sectionals back to back last night.
[time=384] So way to go soccer team, given them a round of applause.
[time=387] (audience applauds) I didn't mention it first service and Bob Freeborn was here, the soccer coach.
[time=394] He wasn't even here so I'm sorry Bob, wherever you are.
[time=396] Way to go soccer team.
[time=398] It is me Steve Webster.
[time=402] The last time I was here with you, I looked more like John the Baptist than I do now.
[time=407] But it is still me, don't be alarmed.
[time=409] It's the same voice, different face maybe.
[time=413] We were singing about John the Baptist words a minute ago.
[time=417] You must increase, I must decrease.
[time=420] And it prompted me in my mind to think about, that's what idolatry sort of switches around.
[time=429] When we are idolatrous, we must increase and he must decrease.
[time=435] That's the really bad trade that idolatry represents to us this morning.
[time=441] Before I go on anymore, I wanted to say something that the Lord prompted me to say this week.
[time=447] Jody and I have in our family, we've been here for about a year and a half attending at Blackhawk.
[time=452] And I want you all to know that Kelly, the elders, my family, we don't see what's going on here simply as me filling in once in a while.
[time=461] We're serving alongside you in small community in the larger setting, the gathering, connecting, going efforts that Blackhawk is involved in.
[time=469] We're very much involved in all those things and we are going anywhere.
[time=472] So we're laboring alongside you.
[time=474] I'm just kind of flashing in and popping back out.
[time=477] I have the great joy of being involved in this ministry now as well.
[time=481] So thank you for allowing me to be a part of it.
[time=483] I wanted you all to know that from us.
[time=485] That this great blessing of being with you on Sunday morning is very much a part of what we see moving forward.
[time=491] That look like very excited.
[time=492] So thanks for letting me do it.
[time=495] We're gonna be in Isaiah this morning, chapter 40 in particular.
[time=499] If you would go there to Isaiah chapter 40, we're gonna jump in around in about verse nine.
[time=503] As you're turning, let me give you a bit of a background as to where we've been and how we got to this point this morning.
[time=509] This series is really about a question and an answer.
[time=515] Three weeks ago, Kelly read the Psalms with us and then the Psalms say things like, "As a deer pants for water, sow my soul longs after you." Okay, Psalm 119 verse 20 says, "My soul is consumed with longing for your word all day long." Okay, so that prompts a question.
[time=544] Why don't we do that?
[time=545] Why isn't that describing our reality day by day, by day?
[time=551] Then last week, the answer came.
[time=555] It was a hard answer.
[time=558] The hard answer is friends that we might be an idolatrous people.
[time=563] And I think the way that idolatry is gonna be framed this morning is gonna bring it rushing down right to where we are.
[time=569] Not some far away distant dream that well, the Old Testament, little green men, all those things, not the case.
[time=577] This is actually much more unsettling than we'd ever maybe like to believe.
[time=581] Having said all that, let's pray together.
[time=584] And now that we're ready to go, Isaiah 40, let me pray with you.
[time=587] I found this poem from William Cooper from the 18th century.
[time=592] I found it to be wildly appropriate for our time this morning.
[time=595] So pray with me, let me pray these words from him for us this morning in light of all that we've said and all that we're going to say this morning.
[time=603] Would you please pray with me?
[time=608] Father, O for a closer walk with you.
[time=612] A calm and heavenly frame.
[time=615] A light to shine upon the road that leads me to the lamb.
[time=620] Return, O Holy Dove, return, sweet messenger of rest.
[time=626] I hate the sins that made you mourn and drove you from my breast.
[time=631] The dearest idol I have known, whatever that idol be.
[time=638] Help me to tear it from your throne and worship only thee.
[time=643] So shall our walks, Father, be close with you.
[time=647] Calm and serene our frame.
[time=650] So pure light shall mark the road that leads me to the lamb.
[time=655] Lord Corbin read from Psalm 115 this morning, that those who worship idols will become like them.
[time=665] Jesus admonished his listeners saying things like Isaiah says, don't you know, haven't you heard?
[time=675] Don't you have eyes to see?
[time=679] Do you have ears to hear?
[time=681] God, give us eyes to see.
[time=683] Give us ears to hear.
[time=685] Help us to respond rightly to the reality of our idolatry and may Lord the psalmist's words be ours before it's all said and done.
[time=696] Thank you, Father, for your word, your love, your grace and your mercy.
[time=700] Open our eyes to see wonderful things from it this morning.
[time=703] This is our prayer in Jesus' name.
[time=706] [AMEN] The proper response to idolatry, that's where we come in this morning.
[time=713] So we don't long after God.
[time=716] We don't long after him because we might be idolatrous.
[time=720] Now what?
[time=722] Rather than simply woe as me, we've blown it, all these things, I went to Isaiah 40, we'll go there together this morning and we'll find a proper response to this sort of distraction that we all experience at varying levels.
[time=735] Creeping idolatry, I think I've referred to it, just creeps in, it's very, very subtle.
[time=740] If you have Isaiah 40 open there before you, what are the first two words of Isaiah 40?
[time=747] Just verse one, just for the record.
[time=749] What are the first two words?
[time=751] Comfort, comfort, interesting.
[time=754] Isaiah is writing his vision that he receives to the people living in Judah and Jerusalem during the time of the first verse of Isaiah says, "Uzziah, Jotham, Ahez, and Hezekiah, four kings of Judah." What you're reading with me this morning in Isaiah 40 is actually given to a people living in exile about 170 years after Isaiah writes it.
[time=777] That's an amazing thing.
[time=780] Modern scholars say, "Oh, it couldn't possibly be written." Then you couldn't possibly have known the future.
[time=784] But even that reality, guys, is a message.
[time=787] The reality that God can give Isaiah a vision of what's gonna happen 170 years in the future is marvelous.
[time=794] And so he's writing in Isaiah 40 to people living in Babylonian exile, people like Daniel, who are struggling with and that really need comfort in their very, very tough circumstances.
[time=806] So here are all the words of this chapter.
[time=809] Hear them with that as your background.
[time=811] Babylonian exiles, Judah in the south, falls to Babylon in 586 BC.
[time=816] It really happened.
[time=817] They were carried away into exile and they're asking some tough questions.
[time=821] God, where are you?
[time=824] You've forgotten about us.
[time=826] Are these Babylonian idols better than you?
[time=830] Do they have you in checkmate?
[time=832] What do we do now?
[time=833] Very appropriate questions for us.
[time=836] Three things I noticed in Isaiah 40 about who God is.
[time=841] I noticed, first of all, as your outline in your bulletin describes God somehow the sermon's title this morning is a sovereign shepherd, which is a very weird partnership.
[time=853] A sovereign shepherd.
[time=855] That's exactly what God is in this passage.
[time=857] Watch as we look through it.
[time=859] Observation number one is that he's a lowly creator, also a strange marriage.
[time=866] God is amazing, letter A, yet approachable.
[time=870] Amazing, yet approachable.
[time=872] Let's look at verse nine.
[time=873] Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good news.
[time=879] Lift up your voice with strength.
[time=881] O Jerusalem, herald of good news.
[time=884] Lift it up, fear not.
[time=886] Say to the cities of Judah, behold your God.
[time=890] What is the good news?
[time=892] This word is the same word used in the New Testament as gospel, the proclamation of good tidings when there was a war in a foreign land.
[time=902] Well, this is so amazing.
[time=903] There's a war in a foreign land.
[time=904] A herald would come back and say, we've won the war.
[time=908] We've been victorious.
[time=909] And so that word, A.U. on Gellion in the Greek, good news for us carries that message.
[time=915] We've prevailed.
[time=917] We've won.
[time=918] What's the good news in this verse?
[time=920] What's that message?
[time=922] What's the herald saying?
[time=923] He's saying in verse nine, the God is coming.
[time=925] God is coming with reward, verse 10.
[time=931] He's coming with might.
[time=932] His arm rules for him.
[time=934] We're saying about God's mighty arm earlier.
[time=937] His reward is with him.
[time=938] His recompense.
[time=940] His restitution is with him.
[time=944] He will tend his flock like a shepherd.
[time=946] That's where it just takes a left turn for me.
[time=949] Mighty God, bringing reward, bringing restitution that he's a shepherd.
[time=955] I have never heard of anything like that before.
[time=957] An ancient world hadn't either, I might add.
[time=960] The opening verses of Isaiah 40 are quoted in Mark chapter one as a fulfillment of prophecy that Jesus' way was prepared by the very same John the Baptist that we sang about earlier.
[time=974] He must increase, I must decrease.
[time=976] John prepared the way of the Lord from Isaiah 40.
[time=981] Friends, the good news that we've been reading about in Isaiah 40, it began to happen with Jesus first coming.
[time=987] It'll be fully realized when he comes back.
[time=990] More on that later, wonderful thing to be thinking about.
[time=994] The good news has already happened, but it's not yet.
[time=998] Hear all of this in the context of idolatry.
[time=1001] What's the proper response to my idolatry?
[time=1003] What does Isaiah 40 do with this reality that I have idols?
[time=1006] We'll define that a little bit carefully later.
[time=1009] What do I do with these idols?
[time=1011] Isaiah says you get an exalted view of the great God.
[time=1015] You line them up side by side and say, "I'm worshiping this, but here's what God is like." Watch how he unpacks this argument in Isaiah 40.
[time=1024] It is absolutely beautiful.
[time=1025] Isaiah is actually called the gospel of Isaiah by a few people as they write it because it's full of stuff like this.
[time=1032] Jesus in an unprecedented way represents all the good news
[time=1039] we've been reading about in Isaiah 40 in himself.
[time=1043] That he is the holy and awesome Ferris Lord Jesus.
[time=1047] We sang earlier.
[time=1048] He is fairer than 10,000.
[time=1050] He is the Lord of all creation.
[time=1052] All of it is for him, but he's a shepherd.
[time=1056] He is God in flesh.
[time=1057] He's a Galilean carpenter.
[time=1059] At the same time, son of God and son of man from Ferris Lord Jesus.
[time=1064] Look at Mark 634 with me.
[time=1067] It'll be on the screens.
[time=1069] All this is about Jesus.
[time=1070] So we can't read these things about God in Isaiah 40 and not do what the New Testament does and frame it like Jesus in the view of him.
[time=1078] When he went ashore, Jesus did.
[time=1080] He saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd.
[time=1087] John 10, Jesus says of himself, I am the good shepherd.
[time=1093] The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[time=1098] This magnificent care, this awesome holy transcendent God
[time=1104] is realized in a Galilean carpenter who's walking around the dusty streets.
[time=1111] It's amazing, friends.
[time=1114] What do I do with my idolatry?
[time=1115] What do I do with this reality that I'm struggling with people, places, things that have robbed my affections from the one God?
[time=1123] What do I do with that?
[time=1126] Well, let's look at what it says about Jesus in Paul's letters and see what the proper response is.
[time=1131] He is approachable letter A, but he's amazing.
[time=1135] At the same time, he is amazing at approachable.
[time=1138] Ephesians one.
[time=1140] There's more, I would take it to Colossians one, Hebrews one, but we'll go a Ephesians one here first.
[time=1145] But you may know what is the hope to which he has called you.
[time=1149] What are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints?
[time=1155] Now, what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe?
[time=1160] Immeasurable greatness.
[time=1164] It cannot be measured.
[time=1167] Idols sin, we can say it any way you want, but sin will take you far than you wanna go and keep you there longer than you want to stay.
[time=1178] Idols have measurable power.
[time=1182] You can see it, you can put it on your shelf.
[time=1185] There it is.
[time=1186] It has power for three hours on a Saturday afternoon.
[time=1189] Then it's done.
[time=1190] That's a little bit painful for me to say.
[time=1193] The immeasurable greatness of Jesus' power toward us who believe according to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule, authority and power and dominion above every name that is named.
[time=1214] Not only in this age, but also in the age to come.
[time=1217] He put all things under Jesus' feet and gave him as head over all things to his body, the church, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
[time=1229] There is no way to read Isaiah 40 and not see Jesus because it's exactly what the New Testament does with that passage.
[time=1237] God's showing up is Jesus showing up.
[time=1241] So what do I do with that truth that I am an idolater?
[time=1246] We are idolaters, what do I do?
[time=1248] Turn your eyes on Jesus.
[time=1250] Turn your eyes, look full in his wonderful face
[time=1256] and the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace.
[time=1262] That's one response, friends.
[time=1266] There's much, much more.
[time=1268] I would ask you to write down a reference in the margin maybe of your notes from Philippians 2, 5 through 11, that's maybe the most amazing place where Jesus' holiness, his might, his power, his name is above every name is met with that he humbled himself and becomes obedient to death even a crucifixion, a humiliating death.
[time=1290] Crucifixion was designed by the Romans to be as excruciating and as humiliating as possible.
[time=1296] And he humbles himself.
[time=1298] It actually says in that passage that he didn't count a quality with God, a thing to be grasped.
[time=1304] Which means that sort of like the fingers of his hand were peeled back and he let go of his equality with God because he knew that only a man could redeem men.
[time=1315] Son of God and son of man.
[time=1318] Let her be in your outline.
[time=1322] The next portion here, the nations are compared to God in verses 12 through 17 of Isaiah 40.
[time=1327] I wanna read this with you and just stop along the way and this is the thing I couldn't stop saying throughout the week, I think I've preached this part of the sermon about 15 times a week, I couldn't stop talking about it all week long, very, very exciting.
[time=1339] Verse 12, Isaiah 40, the nations are compared to God.
[time=1343] Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand?
[time=1347] Would you hold your hand out like this and just kind of cup it like that?
[time=1350] Down in there, look down in your hand.
[time=1352] Down in there is the hollow of your hand.
[time=1355] That little part in there is what is referred to in that fashion, the hollow of your hand.
[time=1360] It says that he has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand.
[time=1365] All the oceans of all the world are in the hollow of God's hand.
[time=1370] Do you know how many gallons are in the world's oceans?
[time=1372] I'm sure you do, you've got it like just in the tip of your tongue.
[time=1375] 300, yes, all of them, well done.
[time=1379] 343 quintillion gallons.
[time=1385] In all the world's oceans, that's a billion million just for the record, whatever that means.
[time=1392] 343 of those in the hollow of God's hand.
[time=1396] What do I do with my idolatry?
[time=1398] Line it up next to that kind of a God, but there's more.
[time=1403] Marked off the heavens with a span, a span.
[time=1407] Would you hold your hand out like this?
[time=1408] Lots of hand motions last couple of weeks, okay?
[time=1410] Span, a span is from your pinky to your thumb.
[time=1414] That's a span.
[time=1415] Isaiah says that God has marked off the heavens with a span.
[time=1420] All the stars and all the galaxies and all the universe are as before you and I in the hand of God that far.
[time=1429] A span.
[time=1432] Marked off the heavens, just like that, with a span.
[time=1435] Enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure.
[time=1441] A measure there is a basket.
[time=1443] So all the dust of all the earth is in God's sand pail.
[time=1447] All the sand, all the beaches, all the deserts is in God's little sand pail.
[time=1452] I'll have a number for that one, but it's pretty amazing.
[time=1457] No estimates on that.
[time=1458] Wade the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance.
[time=1465] Do you know how much a 10,000 foot mountain would weigh?
[time=1468] Again, I'm sure you do.
[time=1470] How much, a lot indeed, 5.7 billion tons.
[time=1475] In a pyramid shaped 10,000 foot mountain.
[time=1481] And God goes, boop, on the scale.
[time=1484] What do I do with my idolatry?
[time=1488] The things that give me value, meaning, significance, purpose, love that aren't God.
[time=1497] What do I do?
[time=1497] Line them up next to him and see.
[time=1501] Who is like him?
[time=1502] There's more, as I have 40.
[time=1506] Who did he consult?
[time=1509] Who made him understand?
[time=1511] Who taught him the path of justice?
[time=1513] And taught him knowledge?
[time=1514] And showed him the way of understanding.
[time=1516] The Israelites are in exile in Babylon, friends.
[time=1519] And the Babylonian gods, they have names.
[time=1522] Marduk was the creator God, and Ea, Ea, was the all wise God.
[time=1528] And the story goes in Babylonian mythology that Marduk had to ask Ea for permission to make the universe.
[time=1535] Could you give me some hints as to how I might do that Ea?
[time=1537] Oh sure, blah, blah, blah, to have conversation together.
[time=1540] Who had to advise God in his creation of the universe?
[time=1545] Is it okay if I go ahead and make the universe now?
[time=1548] Nobody.
[time=1549] Who, who did he consult?
[time=1551] Who was God's architect?
[time=1553] Him.
[time=1554] God has his own consulting firm.
[time=1557] He runs it.
[time=1558] It's very profound.
[time=1561] The nations are like verse 15, a drop from a bucket.
[time=1566] And are accounted to him as dust on the scales.
[time=1572] What's the scale read before he get on it?
[time=1574] What's it supposed to read?
[time=1575] Zero, nothing.
[time=1577] There's dust on those scales.
[time=1580] The nations are dust on the scales.
[time=1582] They're nothing.
[time=1583] Nothing.
[time=1588] The coast lands like fine dust, verse 16.
[time=1591] Lebanon would not suffice for fuel.
[time=1593] Lebanon there refers to the cedars of Lebanon.
[time=1597] He's 130 foot tall, eight foot diameter cedars.
[time=1600] Just spectacularly beautiful.
[time=1602] It's on Lebanon's flag as it turns out.
[time=1605] All the trees, all the animals, and all of Lebanon wouldn't suffice for a burnt offering for the God that we worship.
[time=1612] As the one true God.
[time=1614] What do I do with my idolatry?
[time=1617] How do I respond?
[time=1619] I don't pay it for him.
[time=1620] I don't long for him.
[time=1620] I don't.
[time=1621] My soul isn't consumed with longing all day long.
[time=1625] What do I do?
[time=1626] Give the Lord his proper place.
[time=1631] And that idolatry will seem like Isaiah describes it.
[time=1634] A little silly.
[time=1635] All the nations are as nothing before him, verse 17.
[time=1641] They are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness.
[time=1645] Less than nothing is the point at which a thing moves from being to not being.
[time=1649] Less than nothing.
[time=1653] So there's zero and then there's less than zero.
[time=1655] The nations are before him less than zero.
[time=1658] The second thing I noticed about this passage
[time=1665] with regard to God is that he is a lofty king in verse 18.
[time=1670] And now we have a response to idolatry and all the things we've just talked about.
[time=1676] So this is what Isaiah says, letter A, the absurdity of idols.
[time=1681] It's a nasty word, absurdity, but it's appropriate here.
[time=1685] So to all the things I said, Lebanon, mountains, hollow of your hand, all those things, I give you these words.
[time=1692] To whom then will you liken God?
[time=1693] An idol?
[time=1696] Verse 19, a craftsman cast it.
[time=1700] A goldsmith overlays it with gold and precious things.
[time=1705] And it goes on.
[time=1706] Mark Driscoll in a recent ABC interview defined idolatry this way.
[time=1709] You can be looking for that in the near future.
[time=1712] An idol is someone or something that occupies the place of God in your life.
[time=1716] It's the preeminent, prominent center of your life.
[time=1718] This is just all in case we think idolatry is something for far away places and little gold and silver men in our bookshelves, okay?
[time=1729] The most important person or thing gives you identity, value, meaning, purpose, love, significance and security.
[time=1736] When the Bible uses the word idol, that's what it's getting at.
[time=1740] My wife said this past week, something that was very encouraging to me.
[time=1744] She goes, 'cause whatever my team used to lose a game, it used to be devastated for days afterwards.
[time=1748] I go, I lost the game, which has happened quite a bit.
[time=1752] And she goes, Steve, that doesn't bother you as much as it used to bother you, which is basically code for, you're as much of a dirt bag now as you used to be, which is kind of what she was saying in that sentence.
[time=1760] But as distracted as I used to be, which is hopefully true, honey, I'm not quite as bad as it used to be.
[time=1767] I heard a little promo on ESPN which made my skin crawl.
[time=1774] 'Cause in the South, I used to live in the South and they say in the South football it's like a religion.
[time=1778] It's kind of, oh, ha, ha, so funny.
[time=1780] But then it goes on, it says, we don't gather to worship the sacred, we gather to worship strength and power.
[time=1789] And I was like, oh my God.
[time=1791] It was, it was, there's no apologies, there's no qualification, just there it was.
[time=1795] Let her be in your handout,
[time=1802] God's supreme rule and authority.
[time=1805] Don't you know, verse 21, don't you know, don't you hear, has it been told you from the beginning?
[time=1811] Verse 23, 22 at the end, the heavens are like a curtain stretched out, like a tent to dwell in, 23 who brings princes to nothing and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.
[time=1825] Remember Moemar Qaddafi, remember him?
[time=1828] Libyan dictator, he was at the UN last month and he insisted on being addressed as the king of kings at the United Nations.
[time=1835] Moemar Qaddafi, who makes princes nothing.
[time=1846] Rulers of the earth as emptiness, Moemar Qaddafi.
[time=1851] We're gonna sing a song now in preparation
[time=1858] for what we're about to read in Isaiah, but really very much in light of what we've already talked about.
[time=1863] In Isaiah 40, 28, it says the Lord is the everlasting God.
[time=1868] He will not grow weak or weary.
[time=1870] And then it says later that we are called to wait on Him.
[time=1874] And before you sing it, let me explain what it means to wait on Him.
[time=1878] It's not this.
[time=1879] It's not, that's not what waiting the Lord means.
[time=1885] It means to have confident expectation that God will always act in a manner that's tied to His character.
[time=1895] It's very much like the word hope.
[time=1898] That's what hope is.
[time=1900] I hope it doesn't rain today.
[time=1901] It's not fickle like that.
[time=1904] Waiting on the Lord means that I will confidently expect God to behave like He said He will behave.
[time=1910] When we sing, strength will rise as we wait on the Lord.
[time=1915] That's what we mean.
[time=1916] So let me invite you to sing in response to what we've already said, what we're about to see in just a minute, that the Lord is the everlasting God.
[time=1934] Let's stand as we sing this.
[time=1935] Strength will rise.
[time=1946] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[time=1954] We will wait upon the Lord.
[time=1959] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[time=1963] We will wait upon the Lord.
[time=1968] Our God, you rain forever.
[time=1976] Our hope, our strong deliverance.
[time=1986] You are the everlasting God.
[time=1992] The everlasting God.
[time=1995] You will not boast.
[time=1999] You won't grow weary.
[time=2005] Yeah, strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[time=2018] We will wait upon the Lord.
[time=2024] Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[time=2028] We will wait upon the Lord.
[time=2033] Our God, you rain forever.
[time=2040] Our hope, our strong deliverance.
[time=2051] You are the everlasting God.
[time=2055] The everlasting God.
[time=2060] You do not think you won't grow weary.
[time=2069] You're the defender of the week.
[time=2076] You comfort those in need.
[time=2080] You lift us up on the wings like he goes.
[time=2090] Our God, you rain forever.
[time=2105] Our hope, our strong deliverance.
[time=2116] You are the everlasting God.
[time=2120] The everlasting God.
[time=2125] You do not think you won't grow weary.
[time=2135] You're the defender of the week.
[time=2139] You comfort those in need.
[time=2144] And you lift us up on the wings like he goes.
[time=2158] From everlasting to everlasting.
[time=2166] God, you are everlasting.
[time=2185] You may be seated.
[time=2191] Just quickly where we've been.
[time=2195] God is describing himself and his son Jesus as a lowly creator somehow.
[time=2201] He's amazing and approachable.
[time=2203] The nations compared to God are as nothing.
[time=2208] They're as less than nothing.
[time=2210] In fact, they don't even exist.
[time=2213] God is also revealing himself and as they have 40 to be a lofty king.
[time=2217] In light of that, idols look absurd.
[time=2222] Whatever we give in our lives, significance, value, meaning, and purpose.
[time=2228] It's not him is an idol.
[time=2230] It's not a little person or figurine on the mantle.
[time=2233] It could be that.
[time=2235] It is that sometimes.
[time=2236] I think it's actually nearer than that to us though.
[time=2240] That makes it a little more scary.
[time=2244] In the interview, Mark Driscoll talks about, if you worship another person, you're codependent.
[time=2249] If you worship, pleasure, you're a sex addict.
[time=2253] If you worship, you know, strong drink, you're an alcoholic.
[time=2259] All the modern counseling vernacular is really just code for idolatry.
[time=2263] God's supreme rule and authority is also seen in that section in verses 21 to 24.
[time=2271] Scarcely are they planted verse 24, Isaiah 40, scarcely sown.
[time=2276] Scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth when he blows on them and they wither.
[time=2281] No effort from God is gone.
[time=2283] The tempest carries them off like stubble.
[time=2288] Whatever seems to be overwhelming and impossible for God is very much within his control.
[time=2297] And now we move to the last section of Isaiah 40, the one that we all know very well.
[time=2302] God is a lordly encourager.
[time=2304] He is the everlasting God.
[time=2307] He will not grow weak.
[time=2308] He will not grow weary, but he knows that we will.
[time=2311] The fact that he doesn't grow weak and weary makes him that much more qualified
[time=2319] to give us the strength that we need when we need it.
[time=2323] And you're going to need it on Wednesday, I promise.
[time=2328] He comforts those in need, the song, we're just saying that together, happens to be true.
[time=2333] He will, whatever you need, whatever you need.
[time=2338] Guys, we're needy, joblessness, parenting, marriage.
[time=2344] These are needy things that we all experience.
[time=2348] We are needy people.
[time=2350] Thank God that we are needy.
[time=2353] Because people who are not needy are just that.
[time=2358] God, whatever.
[time=2360] Do you ever thank him for your needs?
[time=2363] I might encourage you that way this morning.
[time=2367] To whom, then, verse 25, will you compare me that I should be like him?
[time=2374] Says the holy one.
[time=2376] Lift up your eyes on high and see who created these, he who brings out their host by number,
[time=2387] calling them all by name.
[time=2389] I forget my student's name sometimes.
[time=2391] By the greatness of his might and because he is strong in power,
[time=2397] not one is missing.
[time=2399] There are 400 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy alone.
[time=2405] 400 billion, that's lots of zeros.
[time=2409] Astronomers took one strip of sky and they took that one strip of sky and they estimated from that one part of the sky that there are 76 trillion stars in all the universe.
[time=2423] That's 70 million million million.
[time=2427] This is what blew my mind.
[time=2431] They further speculate that there are more stars in the known universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches and all the deserts and all the world.
[time=2440] More stars than that.
[time=2443] You ever held sand and you're just a handful of sand?
[time=2446] How many millions are in that handful?
[time=2448] He brings them out by name.
[time=2453] Roy Oswald in his commentary says that God acts with the stars like a shepherd acts with his sheep.
[time=2462] Calls them all by name.
[time=2464] At night, they all come out.
[time=2467] They all come back in.
[time=2469] There's one.
[time=2470] There's two.
[time=2473] There's three.
[time=2473] What a beautiful analogy in this passage.
[time=2475] He knows them all by name.
[time=2478] He knows their spots.
[time=2479] He knows their color.
[time=2480] He knows everything about them.
[time=2481] People for thousands of years have worshiped the stars and God is the one who made those stars.
[time=2492] All over the Old Testament, folks, there's creation theology.
[time=2496] God is insisted to be the creator of the universe because as the creator of the universe,
[time=2502] he has dominion over it.
[time=2503] He has sovereignty over it.
[time=2504] He has all of it is about him.
[time=2506] He made everything.
[time=2507] And by the way, in Colossians 1 of Jesus, it is said all things were made by him
[time=2513] and for him and through him.
[time=2515] He holds all things together.
[time=2519] What do I do with my idolatry?
[time=2520] Lay them at the feet of the Son of God of Jesus.
[time=2525] A manual.
[time=2527] God with us.
[time=2530] There is no way to read Isaiah 40 and not see the person of Jesus, the only one who can be those at the same time.
[time=2537] Amazing but approachable.
[time=2538] He is the exact Hebrews 1, the exact representation of his nature.
[time=2545] Jesus Christ is the exact representation of God in the flesh.
[time=2552] Walking around.
[time=2555] As our example, a late is life down for us.
[time=2560] Okay, that's fine, Steve.
[time=2565] Look at the next verse.
[time=2566] Look at verse 27.
[time=2569] Sometimes people say things with regard to their struggles and they say,
[time=2577] I feel like there's no hope.
[time=2580] I feel like no one loves me.
[time=2583] I feel like it will never be different than it is today.
[time=2586] Those are all legitimate feelings, but they're feelings.
[time=2590] Tony, talk with us about lenses and when you see the world for the lens of your feelings,
[time=2597] you're going to have a very bad day because feelings don't create reality.
[time=2602] They oftentimes color it differently.
[time=2603] Oh, okay.
[time=2604] I feel like no one loves me.
[time=2608] I hear students say that all the time.
[time=2609] There's no hope.
[time=2611] Why should I even try?
[time=2613] This is what it says in verse 27.
[time=2614] Why do you say, oh Jacob and speak, oh Israel, my way is hidden from the Lord.
[time=2618] My right is disregarded by my God.
[time=2624] They're in exile, dragged against their will out of their homes.
[time=2630] All they've ever known thousands of miles away to a foreign idolatrous people.
[time=2635] God has forgotten us.
[time=2637] God has forsaken us.
[time=2638] And Isaiah rebukes them for saying that.
[time=2643] Why do you say that?
[time=2644] Yes, it's a question.
[time=2644] Have you not known?
[time=2646] Have you not heard?
[time=2650] The Lord is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the earth.
[time=2659] He does not grow faint or weary.
[time=2662] His understanding is unsearchable.
[time=2665] There is no end to it.
[time=2668] You will never reach the bottom.
[time=2671] Well, God, you don't know what I've done, Steve.
[time=2673] God could never forgive what I've done.
[time=2677] There is no bottom to the well of his understanding.
[time=2682] No bottom.
[time=2684] Well, you don't know what I would have experienced.
[time=2688] What's been done to me, I don't.
[time=2690] You're right.
[time=2690] His understanding is unsearchable.
[time=2694] You will never be able to send an expedition to the end of God's understanding.
[time=2699] It is beyond searching out.
[time=2701] You will never reach the end.
[time=2702] His ceaselessness.
[time=2706] This is what Alec Mottier said about that.
[time=2710] His ceaselessness keeps him always ahead of the point that we have reached.
[time=2715] He's in Wednesday already.
[time=2718] So when you have a hard day Wednesday, he knows.
[time=2720] He's already there.
[time=2721] He is the Alpha and the Omega, friends, the beginning and the end.
[time=2725] He's the end, too.
[time=2727] He's already there.
[time=2731] You can trust him with whatever is going to happen this week.
[time=2734] What do I do as my idols, Steve?
[time=2736] What do I do?
[time=2737] I'm an idolatist person.
[time=2738] What do I do?
[time=2739] Line them up next to Jesus, God's own son, and then throw them down.
[time=2746] That's what you do.
[time=2749] That's what I have to do.
[time=2751] He gives power to the faint, verse 29.
[time=2754] He gives power to the faint.
[time=2756] And to him who has no might, he increases strength.
[time=2760] He knows that you will be weary and that you will be faint and that you will need strength from him.
[time=2764] That you can't do it on your own.
[time=2766] His expectation of you is very realistic.
[time=2770] Do you see that in that verse?
[time=2773] When you get tired and you get weary and you get lonely and frustrated and you feel all by yourself, he knows.
[time=2781] He knows full well.
[time=2783] God's never said these words.
[time=2786] Oh, wow.
[time=2786] Wow.
[time=2790] The word wow is not in the divine.
[time=2791] It's very profound this morning.
[time=2793] The word wow is not in God's vocabulary.
[time=2795] What?
[time=2796] My goodness.
[time=2798] He knows that we are idolatrous because he made you.
[time=2810] To him who has no might, he increases strength.
[time=2815] Even the students that I teach grow faint and weary.
[time=2820] Young men will fall exhausted.
[time=2822] That's code for fail miserably.
[time=2824] What's the first word of verse 31?
[time=2827] It's a beautiful word.
[time=2831] But they who confidently expect that God will always act in a manner
[time=2841] that he always has acted will renew their strength.
[time=2846] To renew your strength means to exchange strength.
[time=2850] To lay down your weakness and pick up God's strength.
[time=2852] The Hebrew is explicit there.
[time=2854] Renew strength means battery is dead.
[time=2858] I'm getting God's eternal power.
[time=2860] They shall mount up with wings like eagles.
[time=2866] Run and not be weary.
[time=2869] Walk and not faint.
[time=2870] Wings like eagles.
[time=2872] That's pretty great.
[time=2873] I don't know if you thought that's pretty awesome.
[time=2878] That God was not going to just give you his provision like one dollar bills.
[time=2884] Wings like eagles is spectacular provision.
[time=2890] God knows what's coming this week.
[time=2894] And he can provide for whatever need you're going to face and their big needs.
[time=2898] I don't know all of your needs, but I know some of you pretty well.
[time=2900] And you're facing some really, really hard things.
[time=2903] Things I don't understand.
[time=2906] But my understanding, you can search it out.
[time=2908] The last page of my book, you can read that book.
[time=2911] The last page of God's book, you're never going to get there.
[time=2913] Because mercies are new every morning.
[time=2917] His faithfulness is great.
[time=2920] [AMEN] As Corbin and the band come up, I want to read with you Psalm 24
[time=2928] in conclusion this morning.
[time=2931] As we sing this song of response to all that we have read, to all that we've heard,
[time=2937] to all that we have experienced Psalm 24, what a beautiful place to end as a to tie a bow in our conversation.
[time=2945] What do I do with my idolatry?
[time=2947] Let's read.
[time=2948] The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, all that fills it.
[time=2955] The world and those who dwell therein.
[time=2959] By the way, everything in the earth and all who dwell in the earth, that's everything.
[time=2963] I thought you should know that.
[time=2965] The earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof.
[time=2968] This means the world and everything else is all His.
[time=2970] The world and those who dwell therein leaves nobody out.
[time=2974] Just for the record, I thought you should know.
[time=2978] He has founded it upon the seas, established it upon the rivers.
[time=2984] Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?
[time=2985] Who will stand in His holy place?
[time=2988] He who has clean hands and a pure heart.
[time=2992] Who does not lift up His soul to idols?
[time=2995] What is false?
[time=2996] Doesn't swear deceitfully.
[time=2999] He will receive blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of His salvation.
[time=3004] Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob.
[time=3013] Friends, with my idolatry, with our idolatry, we are called to cast it down,
[time=3020] to compare those idols with the great and mighty and awesome God,
[time=3026] and to embrace Him and His Son Jesus for all that He is.
[time=3030] Let's sing together this prayer of response to our idolatry and ask Him for help in the days ahead.
[time=3044] We bow our hearts, we bend our knees,
[time=3051] whose spirit come make us humble.
[time=3056] We turn our eyes from evil things.
[time=3067] O Lord, we cast down our idols, give us clean hands, give us pure hearts.
[time=3079] Let us not lift up souls to another, give us clean hands, give us pure hearts.
[time=3094] Let us not lift up souls to another, give you no God, let us clean a generation that seeks,
[time=3107] and seeks your face, oh God of Jacob, oh God, let us clean a generation that seeks,
[time=3122] let us clean a generation that seeks your face, oh God of Jacob.
[time=3152] We bow our hearts, let us clean a generation that seeks,
[time=3167] let us clean a generation that seeks, let us clean a generation that seeks,

[time=3257] [MUSIC - 111 seconds]
[time=3380] Clean hands are a gift from him.
[time=3384] You can't earn gifts.
[time=3387] Jesus Christ laid down his life.
[time=3391] That we would be free from our idolatry and all the things that plague us.
[time=3396] I think about those lyrics to that hymn.
[time=3398] All the vain things that charm me most I sacrifice them to his blood.
[time=3407] It's weaker to come alongside you and help you on this thing that we've called you to repentance.
[time=3413] The scriptures have called us to repentance.
[time=3417] They've called us to cast down our idols and to seek after him.
[time=3421] To be watching on the website, be watching in your email for us daily this week coming alongside you to encourage you in this way.
[time=3430] We know that we are idolatrous and we're going to help to come alongside and help you respond rightly to him and to what he's called you to.
[time=3440] Let me speak this benediction over you from the Book of Jude.
[time=3445] Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling back into idolatry and to present you blameless without idols before the presence of his glory with great joy.
[time=3461] The only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory, majesty, dominion, authority before all time, now and forever.
[time=3473] Father, give us clean hands and pure hearts.
[time=3478] This is our prayer in Jesus name with great thanksgiving.
[time=3481] [AMEN]
