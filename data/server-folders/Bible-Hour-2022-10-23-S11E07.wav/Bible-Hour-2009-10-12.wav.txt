[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It is good to be here and I wanna say thank you to so many of you who I know because I asked you to, have been praying for me while myself and Jason Mayley from our family here at Black Hawk have been in Russia this past week.
[time=47] What an amazing time.
[time=48] It was to be in a Vannovo again with Pastor Vladimir and the 25, 30 or so church planners and missionaries that are engaged in that ministry with him in the Vledema region.
[time=61] What an incredible time it was to be with those men to encourage them to teach and equip them and to be equipped and taught by them.
[time=69] In so many ways I can't describe it all to you right now.
[time=72] I just want you to know it was a fruitful time.
[time=75] We were very encouraged and it is very good to be home.
[time=79] Hey, in recent weeks we've been engaged in quite a study, quite a discussion, if you will.
[time=85] We've entitled this recent series, the answer that we may not wanna hear to the question that rarely gets asked.
[time=94] And the question that rarely gets asked is why don't you and I pant for God?
[time=100] Why don't we hunger and thirst for him like so many in the scripture?
[time=105] Why isn't there in your life and mine in the everyday of life a true and genuine desperateness for him?
[time=112] And the answer that we came to as we've studied the scriptures is that bottom line, we just don't need him.
[time=120] You and I in this day have come to places in our lives where we just simply don't thirst for him at that level.
[time=129] And when we dig a little deeper and when we pursue this a little further we realize that the scriptures speak to this situation and the scriptures are very clear that those who don't thirst for him at that level are guilty of idolatry.
[time=145] That's right, we have in our own way started to worship and pursue and trust in other little G gods.
[time=153] And we have forsaken our God and the worship of that God and the finding of rest and peace and meaning in him as we've tried to as it says in Jeremiah two did wells trying to find water, other water than the living water.
[time=170] And so today we come to a point in our series where it's time to do something about this.
[time=177] It's time for you and I to respond.
[time=179] And I wanted to take just a moment with you, those of you in our Bible, our audience and I wanted to ask you this morning to do something.
[time=186] For years and years I've sat here and I have said to you and I've meant it that you are a part of our family, that you're considered meaningful and special to us.
[time=198] And I want you to know that as you watch this message today there's gonna be an opportunity given to you to do what it says in Ezekiel 14, six.
[time=208] God said to those who were committing idolatry, he said repent.
[time=213] He said turn away from your futile empty pursuits and come and worship me.
[time=220] Be in relationship with me.
[time=222] Care most about me.
[time=225] Give yourself completely and fully.
[time=227] Not to these things but to a relationship with a living God who provides living water.
[time=232] He says repent, turn from those things.
[time=235] And so as you hear this this morning I wanna invite you to do something.
[time=239] I would love it if you would take some time this week in the days to come as you think through those things that you need to repent from.
[time=247] I wanna ask if you'd just take a few minutes and shoot me an email.
[time=252] Write me a letter, contact me, let me know.
[time=255] See it means a lot to me that I would know what God has been doing in your heart.
[time=260] Let me share in that with you.
[time=261] Let me pray for you in the days and weeks to come I will.
[time=264] If you'll take some time and just send me an email at the email address right here on the screen and let me know what God has shown you.
[time=271] Let me know what God has revealed.
[time=273] Let us as a ministry lift you up in the days to come.
[time=276] Believe me you'll need it.
[time=278] That support and that strength and that encouragement.
[time=281] We wanna walk with you through your repentance process and I hope and I pray to God that what you hear today will encourage you and help you move in a brand new direction in your life.
[time=293] Hey, we love you and we're thankful for your support.
[time=295] We're thankful for your involvement with us.
[time=298] Please keep in touch.
[time=299] Please know how much we care for you and that will pray for you in the days to come.
[time=303] God bless you.
[time=305] I hope your heart is encouraged and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=309] (gentle music)
[time=317] [MUSIC]
[time=347] (audience applauding) And man, I hope you've come to worship him today.
[time=354] Would you stand with us as we begin to sing?
[time=357] I will exalt you, my God, the King.
[time=364] I will praise your name forever and ever.
[time=367] Every day I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever.
[time=373] Sing this with us.
[time=374] [MUSIC - 228 seconds]
[time=628] (audience applauding) [MUSIC - 269 seconds]
[time=905] (audience applauding) - Father, God in heaven, we believe that you are all those things and so much more.
[time=914] We praise you this morning and declare your greatness and your majesty in this place today.
[time=920] We declare God that you are the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords, the one whose greatness no one can fathom.
[time=927] And God, we pray that you would inhabit our praises this morning that you would draw on near that your presence would be with us today as we sing your praises, as we worship you in so many different ways.
[time=941] And as we hear the truth of your word, God may it speak directly to our hearts.
[time=946] We know, Lord, that your nearness is to us our good.
[time=951] Not necessarily to our comfort or to our convenience, but God, your nearness is to us our good.
[time=959] And we pray today that you would be near and that you would leave us transformed and renewed and changed more and more into the image of your son, Jesus.
[time=970] And it's in his name that we pray and ask these things.
[time=973] [AMEN] - Well, hey, good morning, everybody.
[time=977] God, it's good to see you.
[time=978] I gotta admit, I'm in a little bit of a fog today.
[time=981] What an amazing week in Russia.
[time=984] What an incredibly encouraging time.
[time=986] And I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write about it and just kind of send you on an email this week.
[time=992] There are so many things we wanna get to this morning, but what an incredible experience.
[time=997] Again, I've told you before how every time we go to teach and equip and encourage these men.
[time=1004] The same thing happens all the time.
[time=1006] We get taught, we get equipped, we get encouraged.
[time=1009] It was an amazing week for Jason and I, I am so thankful that you all let me go and do these things periodically.
[time=1015] It grows my heart, it expands my mind and my view of our great God, so grateful for Steve Webster being here last week and continuing in this amazing discussion that God has our family in and will continue and conclude in a sense.
[time=1031] Though not really, I think this discussion today, but what an incredible week.
[time=1037] I don't really know what day it is right now.
[time=1038] I'm not sure what time it is.
[time=1040] I'd like to go to bed if you'd let me, but I think I'll stay awake for another 40 minutes or so.
[time=1046] But what a great, great time and it's good to be home.
[time=1049] Hey, on that email, if you're not on the email list, if you're not on my email list, I wish you would be.
[time=1054] Did you just go to our website, go down the right hand side little box there where you can just join Kelly's email list.
[time=1059] I'd love to have you in the loop.
[time=1061] I'd love to be communicating with you every chance I get.
[time=1064] And so do that if you're not on the email list.
[time=1067] And I also wanted to say a special word of thanks.
[time=1069] I think you slipped away, but do you know Dean Watson?
[time=1073] Most of you don't know Dean Watson, do you?
[time=1077] Shake your head no, because most you don't know Dean.
[time=1080] Dean Watson is the short curly haired guy who carries this pulpit up here almost every week.
[time=1086] And Dean Watson has been carrying pulpits and setting stages and serving our Lord and this family for 20 years.
[time=1096] And I signed a card for him this morning that I think is getting passed around and he's such a dear guy and a true servant of the Lord.
[time=1104] And I just wanted to give you a chance to thank Dean for 20 years of service.
[time=1109] [ Applause ]
[time=1116] Well hey, four weeks ago we jumped into a discussion that has been quite a discussion.
[time=1124] And if your notes and letters and you know the emails that I've received and the conversations that I've been blessed to have with so many of you are any indication at all of what God's doing in the heart and soul of this church.
[time=1139] It is something to be grateful for and I am so amazed at what I sense him doing.
[time=1146] It was four weeks ago that we went to Psalm 42 and we looked there and we studied and read about a deer desperately panting for water.
[time=1157] We went to Psalm 28 and Psalm 63 and Psalm 84 and Habakkuk 3
[time=1163] and Philippians 1, we went all over the place, all over the Word of God and what we saw was that there were those who panted
[time=1173] for a taste of God.
[time=1174] They had a hunger, a thirst, a yearning for God.
[time=1179] They searched for him.
[time=1182] They longed to be near him and if they couldn't be near him, if they couldn't be in his presence, Psalm 28 too, if they couldn't hear from him, they came undone.
[time=1193] Down to the pit it says, they were in hell in their hearts and minds if they couldn't be close to and be in proximity to a God who they loved and thirsted for and hungered for and wanted desperately to be with.
[time=1210] We saw it from the pages of God Word, the pages of God's Word, those who were, I said it there just a second ago and I loved this phrase of all the phrases we used.
[time=1220] I probably connected more with this one.
[time=1221] I'm so thankful for Lindsey.
[time=1223] She sang that song a couple of weeks ago.
[time=1225] They were desperate for him.
[time=1231] Desperate.
[time=1233] Gotta have him.
[time=1235] Gotta be close to him.
[time=1237] Desperate for God.
[time=1239] And we asked ourselves the question.
[time=1241] It's the answer that we may not want to hear to the question that rarely gets asked and the question was, they were desperate, why aren't we?
[time=1254] Why isn't that indicative?
[time=1256] So many times in your life and your relationship and my life and my relationship with him, why is there such a lack of panting and hungering and thirsting and coming undone if we can't be with him and near him and hear from him?
[time=1273] Well, the answer was hard to hear.
[time=1276] The answer was all over the pages.
[time=1277] The scripture God has dealt with this and God has spoken to this issue, but the answer was hard for so many of us to hear.
[time=1284] And the answer was simply that many of us in the room this morning, we've decided either overtly or subtly, consciously or subconsciously, that we don't need God, at least not like that.
[time=1299] We just don't.
[time=1304] We're just not truth be told.
[time=1307] We're trying to be truthful.
[time=1308] We're just not that thirsty for him.
[time=1311] Certainly, most of us would agree, not desperate for him.
[time=1324] Why?
[time=1326] Why is that so true?
[time=1329] Why is that such a clear picture of so many of us in the room we kept digging?
[time=1334] We kept looking through the pages of God's word.
[time=1337] Why don't we hunger and thirst for God?
[time=1338] And the scripture's answer was clear, because it says we are idolaters.
[time=1344] Many of us have given ourselves and have been engaged in the sinful practice of idolatry.
[time=1352] Romans 1 described it for us.
[time=1353] You don't have to turn there.
[time=1355] Romans 1, we saw there toward the end of Romans 1.
[time=1357] He talked about those who knew God.
[time=1360] They were aware of God.
[time=1361] They believed in God.
[time=1362] They knew of God's truth.
[time=1366] They knew of God's reign.
[time=1367] They knew of God's character.
[time=1369] They knew God.
[time=1371] But they refused to identify him as such.
[time=1374] It says in Romans 1 that they exchanged the worship of the creator for the worship of the creature.
[time=1381] Their minds were darkened and lost in their futility.
[time=1384] We went to Jeremiah 2.
[time=1390] Jeremiah 2, we read that there were two great evils that the people of God had committed.
[time=1396] And these two great evils, we've committed as well.
[time=1399] He says there in Jeremiah 2, you have forsaken me as your God and you have dug for yourselves broken cisterns.
[time=1407] You have dug for yourself in your effort to somehow find a different source of water.
[time=1414] He said there in Jeremiah 2, I'm the living water.
[time=1417] And I long to give you all that you need.
[time=1419] I long to meet you at your deepest part at the soul level and fill you up.
[time=1424] But no, you have Jeremiah 2, you forsaken me.
[time=1428] And you've gone and dug your own little wells.
[time=1432] And you're attempt to find life.
[time=1435] For sook, they for sook God, they traded, they exchanged their desire for God and their worship of God and the living water that He provides and they swapped them out for Baal.
[time=1451] They swapped them out for Asherah.
[time=1453] They swapped them out for astronomy and the worship of the stars.
[time=1457] They swapped them out for anything they could get their hands on.
[time=1463] And we've done the same thing.
[time=1464] You and I, we come from a long line of idolaters.
[time=1471] And Jesus addressed it.
[time=1473] We didn't look at it specifically.
[time=1474] I think we referenced it, but Jesus in John chapter 4
[time=1480] deals with this very issue.
[time=1481] I don't think it'll be on the screen.
[time=1483] But turn there.
[time=1484] Let me just take you there real quick.
[time=1485] John chapter 4 is the story of the woman, of the Samaritan woman at the well.
[time=1490] And here we have this woman who comes to this well every single day.
[time=1494] Jesus sees the idolatry in her heart.
[time=1497] Jesus sees not only her physical thirst, but more importantly, Jesus sees her spiritual thirst.
[time=1503] He sees the condition of her heart.
[time=1505] He sees that she's been sleeping with man after man after man.
[time=1510] The one she's sleeping with today isn't her husband either.
[time=1514] He understands the desperateness of her soul, not for him, but for that which she thinks will fill her.
[time=1522] And I love what he said there in 4-10.
[time=1525] In John 4-10, Jesus answered and said to her, "If you knew, if you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you what?" Say it out loud, "Living water." Look at 13, Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water, this well, this man dug, man made cistern." You with me?
[time=1554] He says to her in 13, "Everyone who drinks of this water will what, thirst again.
[time=1560] But whoever verse 14 drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst, but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water, springing up to eternal life." Amen?
[time=1577] Wow, what a picture.
[time=1580] Ezekiel 14, you can turn there in your Bibles.
[time=1584] Ezekiel 14, 1-3, we were there just a couple of weeks ago and it says there in Ezekiel 14, verses 1-3,
[time=1597] "Then some of the elders of Israel came to me, Ezekiel, and sat down before me, and the word of the Lord came to me, the prophet saying, son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and have put them,
[time=1614] and have put these idols right before their faces, the stumbling block of their iniquity.
[time=1621] Should I be consulted by them at all?" Ezekiel reminds us that we've taken our idols, my friends.
[time=1628] You'll remember that illustration from just a couple of weeks ago, as I had you hold out your hand, and we closed it, and we opened it, and we closed it, and we opened it, and we've taken those things, many of which aren't evil in and of themselves, some of them are.
[time=1645] And we've held them tightly, and they become in the holding of them tightly, they have become idols.
[time=1653] In your pursuit of them above him, they have become idols.
[time=1656] In your dependence on them above him, they've become idols.
[time=1660] And you're longing for, and you're panting after them, over and above him, they've become idols.
[time=1666] We've taken our idols, our stuff.
[time=1669] You name it, our booze, our money, our parents,
[time=1678] our jobs, our homes, our pills, our illicit affairs,
[time=1684] our food, our toys, and I don't mean buzz lightyear.
[time=1693] I'm not kind of coming down on kids here.
[time=1699] I'm talking about you and me and our toys, our success,
[time=1708] and how important that has become to you and to me, our comfort.
[time=1714] Do you understand?
[time=1719] I don't know if you do.
[time=1720] Sometimes I've been thinking a lot about it this week.
[time=1723] Do you understand how much we want to be comfortable?
[time=1729] I've had to think it through this week on a number of different levels.
[time=1734] I was reading a couple of different places over the last couple of weeks and realized how much I want that for my kids.
[time=1740] I want my kids to have a really good life.
[time=1747] I want my kids to be happy.
[time=1750] I want my kids to be comfortable.
[time=1752] I want my kids to have everything they need.
[time=1755] I want it to go really well for them.
[time=1759] Anybody blame me?
[time=1759] Yes, no?
[time=1761] Probably not.
[time=1762] I want the same for your kids.
[time=1763] But it dawned on me, as I read this week, that you know what?
[time=1769] The truth be told, he may want to further his name, and he may want to advance his kingdom through the suffering of one of my kids.
[time=1776] Now, how am I doing?
[time=1782] Now, who am I going to follow?
[time=1787] Our success, our comfort, our kids and their comfort, our kids and their success, our pleasure, our relief.
[time=1798] We've taken all of these things, and you pick it.
[time=1802] Many of us have made these things what Tim Keller, what Tim Kelly author and pastor Tim Keller calls.
[time=1808] I read it a couple of weeks ago in a book he wrote called "Counterfeit Gods." And I listened to him again this last week on CD, and Tim Keller calls these things.
[time=1820] The Tim Keller calls it, he says, "Deadly, destructive,
[time=1826] idolatry takes place when we hold on to these things and make them the ultimate thing." Do you understand this?
[time=1838] Whatever it is.
[time=1840] He talks about in his book there in the introduction the difference between sorrow and despair.
[time=1847] And it was interesting, I wrote this to you in my email this week in one of them.
[time=1850] I said he talks about how sorrow is being saddened and sorrow is feeling the brunt of something that goes wrong, but yet you know that you're going to live to see another day.
[time=1862] And it may be the loss of a job, or it might be the loss of a home, or it could be this or that.
[time=1866] But whatever it is, because of your perspective on it, it's okay, it hurts, and you're saddened, there's sorrow.
[time=1875] But the sun's going to come up, you know what I mean?
[time=1878] But despair, he says, no, despair is awful.
[time=1882] Despair is dark, because despair comes when what you've lost is your ultimate thing.
[time=1890] It's what you put your hope in, it's what you had banked on, it's what you had trusted in.
[time=1895] He writes in this beginning pages of this book about probably five, six, seven different illustrations of individuals who, when the dot com era busted, or in the recent economic meltdown of our last year and a half, or even he gave some examples of an individual or two who were caught up in the Bernie Madoff deal.
[time=1913] He just gave example after example of individuals who had killed themselves.
[time=1918] Guys who had jumped off buildings.
[time=1920] Guys who had thrown themselves out windows.
[time=1923] Guys who had hung themselves in their closets.
[time=1925] Guys who had shot themselves in the head sitting behind the wheel of their jaguar.
[time=1931] Because what they had lost was for them their ultimate thing.
[time=1935] And when you lose your ultimate thing, you're done.
[time=1938] And Ezekiel says that we've taken these things
[time=1946] and we've made them ultimate and we've, what's the text say?
[time=1949] We've put them in our hearts.
[time=1952] We've put them in our hearts, closed, fisted, which always leads to the stumbling of iniquity.
[time=1961] The falling that comes with sin, idolatry.
[time=1965] I said it in the video that we sent you this week.
[time=1968] I hope you got it.
[time=1968] Idolatry always leads to ruin.
[time=1971] It always has led to ruin.
[time=1973] It will always lead to ruin.
[time=1976] There's no question, there's no what if, there's no but.
[time=1979] It's just going to lead to ruin.
[time=1982] Idolators don't pant for God because they've dug their own wells
[time=1989] and they're drinking their own dirty water.
[time=1994] Ezekiel 14-6, what are we to do, my friends?
[time=1999] What are we to do?
[time=2001] Ezekiel 14-6, therefore, say to the house of Israel, thus says the Lord God.
[time=2008] He says to Ezekiel, hey, let them know.
[time=2011] And make sure they know this isn't you.
[time=2012] Make sure they know it's me.
[time=2014] Therefore, say to the house of Israel, thus says the Lord God.
[time=2018] What's that first word there?
[time=2019] Say it out loud.
[time=2020] Repent.
[time=2021] Say it louder.
[time=2023] Repent.
[time=2024] And I love how in the passage here, right here in the text, He gives us the definition of the word.
[time=2030] You say, what does repent mean?
[time=2031] It's right there.
[time=2032] He says, thus says the Lord God.
[time=2034] Repent and turn away from your idols.
[time=2038] And turn your faces away from all your abominations.
[time=2043] And so it's really simple.
[time=2044] It's a bit complex at times.
[time=2046] And it certainly does require a great deal from you and I in boldness, encourage, and obedience.
[time=2051] But here's the deal.
[time=2052] There's the little G. God.
[time=2053] There's what you've held in your hand.
[time=2055] Here is the sin that has separated you from a loving God full of living water because you've chosen to come over here and bank on and put your trust in this, whatever this is.
[time=2066] So here it is, repentance is when that's exposed, the Word of God and the Spirit of God at work to expose in you and me the sin.
[time=2076] And repentance is when we turn away.
[time=2080] Repentance is agreeing with God about the sin and moving in a completely opposite direction.
[time=2085] Very important that you hear this.
[time=2087] This isn't repentance.
[time=2091] I sort of-- you know what I mean?
[time=2093] I sort of turned-- I sort of kind of came away from it.
[time=2096] But no, repentance is turning your back on it because you turned your back on him.
[time=2102] That's what happened when you forsook him.
[time=2104] You walked the other way.
[time=2105] Now we're forsaking this.
[time=2107] We're turning our back on it.
[time=2109] And we're moving in a completely different direction.
[time=2113] Repentance is letting it go, calling it what it is, and moving toward what's true and right and good.
[time=2122] If this is you and I know it's me, let me just say that.
[time=2131] I know it is me.
[time=2135] What does God's word call us to do?
[time=2137] To repent, to turn away from that little g God whose water
[time=2143] will never satisfy.
[time=2144] And I want to say this.
[time=2145] And I want to say this in all honesty.
[time=2147] I don't want to sound condescending because I'm not.
[time=2150] I'm not mocking you.
[time=2152] I'm not making light of you at all.
[time=2155] But I know that there are some in this room.
[time=2160] I know there may be some of you watching on the broadcast.
[time=2163] There may be others of you listening online.
[time=2165] And I know that there is somebody out there right now who's saying this.
[time=2169] And I know you're saying it because I said it.
[time=2175] You're saying, hey, Kelly, I just want you to know.
[time=2181] I don't want to ruin your little sermon thing there.
[time=2183] But my little g God is really working well for me.
[time=2193] I'm having a lot of fun.
[time=2195] I kind of like it.
[time=2198] Gives me a little relief, makes me feel better, seems to be working,
[time=2205] sleeping pretty good.
[time=2206] And I just want to say to you, listen, I'm not cracking on you.
[time=2214] I'm not scolding you.
[time=2217] I'm not slapping you on the wrist.
[time=2220] I just want to remind you, and I want to tell you today, first of all, I want you to know that I love you.
[time=2226] And we care about you.
[time=2229] And you're living large.
[time=2232] And you're doing your thing.
[time=2234] But you're drinking ocean water.
[time=2236] That makes sense.
[time=2239] I mean, you're really thirsty.
[time=2241] You and I both know that.
[time=2242] And you're like the guy in the raft who finally says, you know what?
[time=2245] Forget it.
[time=2245] I'm drinking this stuff.
[time=2247] And you start drinking it.
[time=2249] And anybody in the room who knows, we've all seen the movies and we all pretty much know the facts.
[time=2253] When you drink the ocean water, does it immediately kill you?
[time=2256] Yes or no?
[time=2257] No.
[time=2258] It takes what?
[time=2261] It takes time.
[time=2264] So whoever you are, the time will come.
[time=2268] And it'll start to kill you.
[time=2271] It'll all break down.
[time=2273] It'll all start to fall apart.
[time=2276] I hope it falls apart for your sake.
[time=2278] And those around you, I hope it falls apart slowly.
[time=2281] So you can at least see it and maybe reach out of hand and we can help.
[time=2286] I hope it's not a calamity.
[time=2287] I hope it's not thoroughly and utterly and completely destructive for you.
[time=2294] But I just want to tell you, I've been there.
[time=2296] I've drank that water.
[time=2298] I've said those things.
[time=2301] And God's Word's really clear.
[time=2303] It'll all come to an end.
[time=2306] And we want you to know if that's you, we're here for you.
[time=2309] And the truth of God's Word says to you today, repent.
[time=2316] Those of us who know better can repent.
[time=2319] Those of us who for the very first time are coming to the realization of God's design for our lives and what it means to live in relationship with the one who brings forgiveness and meaning.
[time=2330] Everybody, God's Word says, repent.
[time=2339] The Scriptures come in that it's God's children.
[time=2343] We are to repent.
[time=2344] We are to turn away from our meaningless, futile in the end, self-destructive panting and instead drink living water and live.
[time=2354] Listen to this, having our desires.
[time=2356] This is really what this boils down to.
[time=2358] As I've thought about it, as I've read about it, as I've chewed on this for the last five weeks, my friends, this really boils down to your desires and mine.
[time=2368] And where those desires are aimed and where those desires are being met, have our desires met fully and completely in him, or to worship and run to the Creator, not the created thing.
[time=2382] Listen, listen to what John Piper says.
[time=2386] I love this quote, you've heard things like this over the last few weeks, but I thought this was unique and I wanted to share it with you.
[time=2393] Piper says, hunger for other things.
[time=2395] There's the enemy and the only weapon that will triumph in this battle with hunger for other things is a deeper hunger for who?
[time=2406] Say it for God.
[time=2409] The weakness, this is interesting.
[time=2410] The weakness of our hunger for God is not because he is unsavory.
[time=2414] It's not that he doesn't taste good.
[time=2415] It's not that we think he's bad.
[time=2417] It's not like he's liver, you know what I mean?
[time=2421] The weakness of our hunger for God is not because he is unsavory but because we keep ourselves stuffed with other things.
[time=2432] Perhaps then the denial of these things might express or even better increase our soul's appetite for God.
[time=2443] He goes on, remember this as well.
[time=2447] What is at stake here is not just the good of our souls.
[time=2450] This just isn't about us.
[time=2451] This is about him.
[time=2453] What's at stake is not just the good of our souls but also the glory of God.
[time=2457] Stop right there for a moment.
[time=2458] Remember, it's the one primary thing we've been called to do.
[time=2460] It's the one primary reason God's left us here is that you and I and our relationship with him in the way that we live and the way that we function and the way that we choose we are to be a people who bring great glory and honor to God.
[time=2475] Amen?
[time=2476] That's why we're here.
[time=2477] And I love what he says.
[time=2480] He says, and God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[time=2489] The fight of faith is a fight to feast
[time=2496] on all that God is for us in Christ.
[time=2500] And we've been telling you this for weeks and he reiterates it right here.
[time=2505] What we hunger for most, we what?
[time=2510] It's really true and I hope you know that.
[time=2512] I hope you believe that.
[time=2513] I hope you're honest enough with yourself today to say it.
[time=2517] What you hunger for most, you worship.
[time=2520] It has become your God.
[time=2524] So repent, God's word says, repent, see it, say it.
[time=2532] Turn your back on it.
[time=2538] Open up your fist.
[time=2540] Let it go and move in a different direction.
[time=2544] How do you do this?
[time=2545] Somebody might ask, what's this look like?
[time=2548] Kelly, can you point me someplace?
[time=2549] Can you give me any indication of what it would be like to actually do this to something that I've identified as idolatrous in my life?
[time=2559] Oh, my friends, there's so many places that we could go, so much that we could look at.
[time=2563] I wanna show you this morning just by virtue of a little exercise if we can do this.
[time=2568] And I know a lot of you aren't note takers, but some of you are, you may have a pen, you may not borrow one if you need to.
[time=2573] Would you all get a pen?
[time=2575] Please go ahead.
[time=2576] Everybody get a pen.
[time=2577] Find some space there on your note sheet or on a little scratch piece of paper.
[time=2583] Just everybody, if you can participate with this, I'd love it.
[time=2587] And here's what I want you to do.
[time=2588] I'm gonna give you a passage and I'm not gonna have you turn there today.
[time=2592] I'm gonna have you write it down.
[time=2594] And I'll tell you what, you can turn there tonight.
[time=2595] You can turn there this afternoon.
[time=2597] You should read this on your own.
[time=2599] You should read this with your kids.
[time=2601] You should share it with your grandkids.
[time=2603] You should read it as a small group this week.
[time=2605] You should go over it in your class.
[time=2607] I mean, you should take some time to really think this passage through.
[time=2612] But today I just want you to write it down.
[time=2614] And I'm gonna read to you from this passage.
[time=2617] And I want you as I read to write some things down before we get to those things.
[time=2621] Here's the reference, write it down.
[time=2622] Second Kings chapter 22 and second Kings chapter 23.
[time=2627] Just write those down.
[time=2628] Second Kings 22, second Kings 23.
[time=2633] And here's what I want you to do.
[time=2635] As I take you through some highlights from these two chapters and I give you some backdrop.
[time=2641] As I read to you and as I speak to you, I want you on your piece of paper to write down words that pop off the page to you and sound to you to be repentance language.
[time=2653] They seem to be terms that would answer the question, how should I do this?
[time=2658] What should my repentance from this or that or that?
[time=2661] What should it look like, Kelly?
[time=2663] I mean, how should I really go at it?
[time=2665] Think about these things.
[time=2668] And I'm gonna have your pen and just write them down.
[time=2670] The words that jump off the page as I take you through this real briefly.
[time=2674] Second Kings 22, what we see here is an amazing story of a young king named Josiah.
[time=2681] And Josiah was, boy, I think eight or nine when he first took over the throne and Josiah comes into a situation that was dark and not at all God honoring.
[time=2691] They had forgotten about their God.
[time=2694] They had left their God.
[time=2696] They had swapped them out for all kinds of illicit and horrible and unspeakable idolatry.
[time=2702] And at the beginning of 22, Josiah sends a messenger
[time=2708] to the temple and there in the temple, the messenger finds what had been missing for years and years and years.
[time=2713] The people had been without, anybody know what it was?
[time=2717] The scriptures.
[time=2719] The people had been without the word of God.
[time=2723] They had not had a copy of the Torah.
[time=2726] They'd not been able to read God's truth and they're not being able to read it.
[time=2731] They had forgotten about it and wandered away from him.
[time=2734] So they find a copy of the scriptures and it's brought to Josiah and he reads it.
[time=2740] And when Josiah heard the words of the book of the law, 22, 11, he tore his robes.
[time=2747] And in 22, 19, because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the Lord, God says, I have heard you.
[time=2756] Listen, the king renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lord, the covenant to follow the Lord and keep his commandments, regulations and decrees with all of his heart and with all of his soul.
[time=2772] And then all the people, see, Josiah does this.
[time=2776] Josiah reconnects and re-pleges himself to follow God with everything he had.
[time=2782] The people see this and it says there in 23, 3, 3 that they pledged themselves as well to the covenant.
[time=2789] And the king in 23, 4, the king ordered Helchia.
[time=2796] To remove them from the temple of the Lord, all the articles of idolatry, all the articles of worship that were made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts.
[time=2808] And he burned them, he burned them outside Jerusalem.
[time=2813] 23, 6, he took the Asherah poles and he burned them there.
[time=2817] He ground the Asherah poles into powder and he scattered their dust over the graves of the common people.
[time=2824] In 23, 7, it says he tore down.
[time=2827] In 23, 8, he desecrated the high places.
[time=2831] In 23, 10, he destroyed their idols.
[time=2835] Any words popping off the page for him?
[time=2837] He removed and he burned their altars.
[time=2841] He pulled down, he removed them.
[time=2844] He smashed them into pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley in 23, 14.
[time=2851] He smashed the sacred stones and cut down the remaining Asherah poles.
[time=2857] He demolished in 23, 15 and 23, 20.
[time=2861] He slaughtered and killed all the priests
[time=2868] who had been engaged in leading God's people
[time=2874] in their idolatrous endeavors.
[time=2879] Neither, listen, 23, 25.
[time=2883] Neither before nor after Josiah was their king like him who turned to the Lord as he did with all his heart
[time=2893] and with all his soul and with all his strength in accordance with all the law of Moses.
[time=2903] So why do I read that to you?
[time=2908] Well, you asked, I guess you really didn't, but I'll assume you wanted to know, like I want to know.
[time=2917] As I've been trying to deal with some things in my own heart and life in recent days, how do we come at this?
[time=2927] What kind of effort should I give this?
[time=2930] As I repent and turn and move in a new direction, what should I do with these things that held me?
[time=2937] So captive, so in bondage.
[time=2940] Well, you know what I wanted you to hear that?
[time=2945] I want you to read it today or tonight or tomorrow on your own.
[time=2948] I want you to keep reading Second Kings 22 and 23, read it all week long.
[time=2953] And I think it paints for you and I a really clear picture of what your repentance, yours, should look like.
[time=2962] I wrote down a few things.
[time=2966] I think repentance has a personal component to it.
[time=2969] And I really do believe, my friends, that there's a corporate or family component to repentance.
[time=2974] But let me just talk to you for a moment about the personal side of your repentance today.
[time=2978] And I think it's very appropriate that we come today to a time of communion.
[time=2982] We come today to a time of remembering the great sacrifice of our Lord.
[time=2986] And you and I both know that one of the things God's word calls you and I to do is we come to the table of communion is that we're to repent.
[time=2996] We're to make sure that things are right before God.
[time=2999] And so we give you in these moments here, an opportunity to do this very thing.
[time=3003] Three things, you have to be aggressive, I believe.
[time=3008] In your repentance, you have to be aggressive and I have to be aggressive and thorough in our repentance.
[time=3014] Josiah, leave any stone unturned?
[time=3018] Yes or no?
[time=3019] Did he just say, "Hey God, we're really sorry.
[time=3023] "We'll make this right now.
[time=3025] "What's for dinner?" No, no, no, no.
[time=3027] He was thoroughly given to looking behind every wall.
[time=3032] He looked at every corner.
[time=3033] He went into every high place.
[time=3035] He went wherever he needed to go and whatever he found that wasn't right got burned, got smashed, got demolished, got ground into ashes.
[time=3042] Be aggressive, my friend.
[time=3045] Be honest.
[time=3047] Be honest with yourself and be honest before God and be aggressive and thorough in your repentance.
[time=3052] Number two, I believe this practically and I believe this biblically.
[time=3056] You got to tell somebody.
[time=3058] Did Josiah just kind of go into a room and go over in a corner and whisper this to God?
[time=3066] Or did he follow through with his repentance in the sight of all the people?
[time=3072] And I'm not saying you got to come and tell all the people.
[time=3074] I'm just saying, you know what?
[time=3075] I don't think it's necessarily just a private thing.
[time=3079] I think there's great strength and great encouragement when you and I bring it to another for the help and the encouragement and the accountability and the love and the support that I know I need at times.
[time=3090] And you know you need.
[time=3093] We've got to be aggressive and thorough.
[time=3095] We've got to tell someone.
[time=3097] And you know what truth be told?
[time=3098] You'll probably have to repent again when tomorrow.
[time=3103] We'll probably have to keep confessing our sins.
[time=3106] We'll probably have to keep counting on the grace and the mercy of God as he grows us through this process and we'll keep confessing and we'll keep repenting.
[time=3116] We'll keep turning and we'll keep moving away.
[time=3118] It's not a one-time deal.
[time=3122] It's something we'll have to give ourselves to in the days to come.
[time=3124] So what should you do?
[time=3127] Should you join our addiction recovery ministry
[time=3135] that we call celebrate recovery that's been formed to help people like you and me move toward healing and peace and harmony and relationship with God as God's word and God's truth and the support of others moves us away from the deadly harmful addictions of life.
[time=3150] Should you do that?
[time=3151] Should you cancel your trip?
[time=3154] Should you give away whatever you have too much of?
[time=3161] I mean look around your life.
[time=3168] Should you move to a smaller home?
[time=3169] I heard this last week somebody started sharing
[time=3177] their credit card statement openly with a older, wiser, more frugal friend.
[time=3188] And it got real interesting real quick and it got real helpful.
[time=3198] Maybe you should move to a smaller home.
[time=3201] You know what?
[time=3202] Maybe you should just move to a smaller life.
[time=3204] Does that make sense?
[time=3207] Sometimes this is a lifestyle issue.
[time=3209] I know all about it.
[time=3211] Something I'm having to work through and think through in my own life.
[time=3214] Maybe there ought to be a willingness in you and me to move to smaller living and away from those things that have so captivated you and I for so long.
[time=3227] Maybe you should increase.
[time=3229] Maybe repentance for you means increasing your sacrificial giving because truth be told it's not really very sacrificial.
[time=3236] It hasn't really hurt you.
[time=3239] It hasn't really stretched you.
[time=3241] It hasn't really put you in a place of greater dependence on God.
[time=3245] It's been very calculated.
[time=3247] It's been very monitored.
[time=3249] It's been very regulated.
[time=3251] Think about it.
[time=3256] Jason and I were in Russia talking about this stuff all week.
[time=3259] Really helps to have somebody to kind of wrestle with.
[time=3263] Jason and I were thinking about the rich young ruler in Matthew 19.
[time=3267] The guy he wanted in, you know, he was so amazed by Jesus.
[time=3270] He wanted to come and follow, wanted to give his life, comes to Jesus and says, "Hey, I want in." Jesus says, "Well, you gotta do this, this, this, and this." And he says, "Well, I've already got that covered." Which he really didn't.
[time=3280] But then see, Jesus looked into the, Jesus looked into the reality of his soul.
[time=3286] He knew, Jesus knew what he loved.
[time=3289] Jesus knew what he was holding onto.
[time=3290] He said, "Hey, go sell all your stuff." Give it away.
[time=3294] And the text says the guy left, grieving.
[time=3299] Left and walked away, said, "Nope.
[time=3302] "I am not going to let go of what I want."
[time=3309] And if it means I lose out on you, Jesus, so be it, I'm out of here.
[time=3316] And he walks away.
[time=3317] Maybe you should move to a smaller life.
[time=3324] Maybe you should stop spending so much time dreaming about a bigger one.
[time=3329] Does that make sense?
[time=3331] Should you stop spending countless hours in mental energy, wishing you had more money, more clothes, more fun, and instead be more content and more grateful for what you have.
[time=3344] Should you stop making excuses and start serving him?
[time=3348] Serving him inside these four walls and serving him outside these four walls.
[time=3353] Should you bring a trusted friend, I'll say it again,
[time=3359] should you bring a trusted friend into the innermost circle of your life and the darkness and the fear and the uncertainty and the struggle that's really there.
[time=3368] And should you beg him or her to help you move forward.
[time=3375] I had to repent this morning, driving in here.
[time=3377] Again, if something I've been repenting of for months and months, more steadily, for months and months in these last six, seven, eight months.
[time=3386] I just sit there in my car this morning and think to myself, "Should I stand?
[time=3391] Am I really going to stand up there and say all of this, God, that you've put on my heart and risk so many of them not liking me
[time=3403] and not liking my message and not agreeing with my thinking or your truth?" And I just had to do my best to trust him with that and say what God's word says and say what God's put on my heart.
[time=3418] Should you do all these things?
[time=3422] Here's the point, I'll have Corbin come on up and he's going to continue to prepare us for communion.
[time=3429] But here, hear me now.
[time=3430] Listen, should you do all these things?
[time=3433] For the most part, I don't know.
[time=3438] I mean, I kind of do and I kind of don't, but here's the thing, I'm not about to start mandating your repentance.
[time=3445] And here's what I do know.
[time=3447] What I do know is God knows and you know.
[time=3450] God knows and you know what's not right in here.
[time=3456] God knows and you know where there's a clenched fist, my friend, and I love you and I want his best for you and I'm just begging you today to be willing to let go and to allow God to deal with you on whatever level he may.
[time=3472] God, I pray that you will allow him and his spirit and his truth to continue to address these things in your life as he continues to address these things in mind.
[time=3489] (gentle music)
