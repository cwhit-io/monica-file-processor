[time=426] [AMEN] - Well, hello again everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=430] And I'm so thankful that you've tuned in and especially today because I've got some friends that I want you to meet and I've got a ministry that we're involved in here at Blackhawk that I'm so thankful for that I think some of you have heard about, others of you may not, but it is a life-changing ministry and I'm so grateful for Steve McMaster and Elaine Malentus, they're here with me today.
[time=453] And Steve and Elaine help give leadership and involvement to a ministry called Celebrate Recovery.
[time=460] If you've been a part of the Bible Hour audience over the last year or so you've seen a series we did here at the church, about an eight week series entitled Celebrate Recovery.
[time=472] And it's the opportunity God gives us through the power of His Word and the encouragement of His people to move away from the destructive and painful addictions in life.
[time=483] And Celebrate Recovery has now been going on here at Blackhawk for about six months.
[time=488] Is that right, you guys?
[time=489] - Yeah. - That's right and I was so encouraged when Steve first came to me and talked to me about Celebrate Recovery because there are other churches, the chapel and fellowship missionary and pathway, several other churches in our area here in Fort Wayne that are hosting Celebrate Recovery gatherings on different nights of the week and I'm so grateful.
[time=509] Ours is on Friday night, we're gonna talk about that in a minute.
[time=512] But Steve, I wanna start with you.
[time=514] Would you just share with the viewing audience and these folks are family?
[time=519] How Celebrate Recovery initially made a difference in your own life and then just talk a little bit about the ministry itself?
[time=525] - Well, I was introduced to Celebrate Recovery about two and a half years ago and I've been in recovery meetings for the last 20 years.
[time=533] But since my involvement in Celebrate Recovery, there's issues in my life that I've never dealt with where Christ is finally, I'm finally let it be in those rooms that I've blocked them out of.
[time=544] And relationship issues, resentments and some forgiveness areas that I've really had to deal with and I couldn't have done that without other Christians.
[time=552] - Resentment, resentment, relationships, forgiveness, it's helped you make progress in all those areas.
[time=559] And you're a recovering alcoholic and you've been sober for how long?
[time=564] - 1980 was when I took my last drink.
[time=566] - 1980.
[time=568] - I took my last drink in 1980, praise God.
[time=571] Well, Steve's been a huge encouragement to me personally through Steve and others on the team.
[time=576] Their involvement with me, I really came to realize some addictive behavior seriously in my own life and through the Celebrate Recovery series began to, with the help of God and his word and others, address some of those issues in my own personal life and I can't tell you what a difference it's made.
[time=596] Elaine, tell us how you got involved in all this and some of the ways in which it's been an encouragement to you.
[time=601] - Well, I met someone who was in Celebrate Recovery and I just saw a change in their life and I thought, wow, I want to check that out and I got involved with the leadership and I thought, oh, I didn't really need it that much.
[time=616] But as I got more involved, I realized that I had a lot of pain and hurt from my previous marriage and divorce and through it, the Lord has just been doing a healing in me, a deeper healing and just showing me, you know, first of all, Celebrate Recovery is a safe place.
[time=635] It's a safe place for everybody to come.
[time=637] It's not judgmental, everybody's very encouraging and supportive.
[time=643] It's a place for us to take off our masks and become real and just to look at what's there, things that we didn't even realize were there but as the Lord works in our lives, he really brings hope and healing.
[time=656] - That's good, that's well said.
[time=657] Hope and healing, I hope you heard that.
[time=661] It's what this ministry is about and I want to just end our little segment here by just talking about this briefly.
[time=669] You guys both mentioned, it really is a safe place and it's a place that's open to anybody, right?
[time=676] I mean, I know that there are younger people, there are older people, there are coat and tie people, there are factory workers, there's hourly wage, there's educated, uneducated, it really is a place where anyone can come.
[time=693] - True? - Yes, yes.
[time=695] - Some of the other issues that are presently people are dealing with is pornography, sexual misconduct.
[time=703] As I mentioned, resentments, unforgiveness, tobacco use, there is no limit to what God wants us and what he wants to do in our lives if we're willing to be humble and motivated.
[time=716] - Well said, well I hope you caught that.
[time=718] Oftentimes when you and I think about recovery, we think about alcohol and drugs and what I've learned from Elaine and Steve and others is that, like Steve said, from pornography to food, to anger, to resentment, to workaholics, the whole nine yards, God wants to come and help us move away from habits and patterns that are destructive.
[time=741] - That's right, overeating, overworking, overspending, low self-esteem, pride.
[time=746] You know, we all deal with different issues and a lot of times we're in denial about it.
[time=751] - Yeah, well thank you, both of you.
[time=754] Thanks for the work that you're doing and I wanna say thanks to those of you in the audience who may be this morning as you listen to this.
[time=762] Maybe there's a cord that gets struck in your own heart.
[time=765] Maybe you've known for a long time that there is an issue that you need help with and I'm so grateful that we can offer you that help with something like celebrate recovery and people like Steve and Elaine who will love you and come alongside you and give you great encouragement.
[time=779] Friday nights at seven o'clock, right here on our South Campus, it's the building kind of connected to and upstairs from our worship center.
[time=789] There'll be signs out and people there to greet you.
[time=792] Seven o'clock Friday nights right here at Blackhawk, we hope you'll come and God bless you.
[time=796] Have a great, great week.
[time=799] Ephesians 2 10 says, "We are God's workmanship." In essence, His masterpiece.
[time=807] Now I don't know about you, but when I get up in the morning and I look in the mirror, I don't see a masterpiece.
[time=813] Maybe a Picasso, but I want to be a masterpiece.
[time=817] I wanna be everything God has created me to be.
[time=820] And so I go to Him and I say God, do whatever it takes to get the things out of my life that don't need to be there.
[time=829] Mold me into the image of your son so that I can be your masterpiece.
[time=835] - Hi. - Whoa, who are you?
[time=837] - I'm God. - You know you're not.
[time=839] - Yes I am, you said the prayer, so here I am.
[time=841] That's how it works.
[time=842] - Okay, well, if you're God, then why don't you make it snow in here?
[time=845] - You know, if I made it snow in here, I'd get kind of yucky, so I really don't wanna do that.
[time=848] - See, you're not God.
[time=850] - Well, what makes you say that?
[time=852] - She said yucky, God doesn't say yucky.
[time=855] - Yes, I do, it's a Greek word.
[time=857] - Okay, well, if you're God, then what does lamentations, 15-9 say?
[time=863] - You know, lamentations is a really short book, it only has five chapters.
[time=867] - Why so short?
[time=868] - I was tired of lamenting.
[time=869] - Hmm.
[time=870] - Well, if you're God, then who's gonna win the World Series?
[time=874] - You know what, I'm not so much into playing games.
[time=875] Why are you so much into playing games?
[time=877] - You are God.
[time=878] - Well, gave it away.
[time=880] - You answered my question with a question.
[time=881] - I did.
[time=882] (laughing) - I do that, don't I?
[time=885] (laughing) - All right, here we go.
[time=887] - Okay.
[time=888] - Oh, wait, what's this?
[time=891] - Oh, these are the tools I'm gonna use to make you into my original masterpiece.
[time=894] - Oh, okay. - Yeah.
[time=896] - Wait a minute.
[time=897] - Yeah.
[time=898] - I thought you were a carpenter.
[time=899] - That's my son.
[time=900] - Right. - Okay.
[time=901] - Okay.
[time=902] (laughing) - Oh, wait, how do you know what to chisel and what to leave?
[time=907] - Oh, I'm gonna get rid of all the things in your life that aren't of me, kinda like dead weight.
[time=910] - Oh, well, that's the case.
[time=911] Could you just focus on this area right here?
[time=914] - I've been trying to get rid of it for years.
[time=915] I mean, I've tried watching what I eat, I've tried exercise, I haven't tried Pilates for a while.
[time=921] That was awkward.
[time=922] - Yeah.
[time=923] - But I can't seem to get rid of it.
[time=924] So if you could just chisel right in this area here.
[time=926] - Okay, are you gonna talk or can I chisel, talk, chisel, talk, chisel, talk, chisel?
[time=929] - No, no, chisel.
[time=930] - All right, some of my children like to talk.
[time=932] - Not me.
[time=933] Bring on the chisel.
[time=934] - All right, here we go.
[time=936] You know, you've got some fried and some anger and you compare yourself to others
[time=943] instead of me.
[time=944] You're lazy.
[time=948] But you pretend like you're really, really busy.
[time=951] And you've got a problem with lust.
[time=956] - Okay, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[time=957] I do not have a problem with lust.
[time=958] - You don't have a problem with lust?
[time=959] - No, I can quit anytime, I...
[time=961] Okay.
[time=963] Maybe we can take a little break.
[time=966] I feel like I'm doing pretty good, you know?
[time=968] - You know, you are doing good, but when you look in the mirror, who do you see?
[time=972] - Well, I see me.
[time=973] - Okay, well then I need to keep chiseling away 'cause ultimately I need you and others to see my son.
[time=978] - Okay.
[time=980] - You know what?
[time=981] Don't take this the wrong way, but when I start to look more like your son, people get really uncomfortable around me.
[time=985] Like even my friends at church, they're like, "Oh, you're holier than that.
[time=989] Why won't you do that?" - Okay, so what you're saying is, you'd rather play God in certain areas of your life than allow me to be God over your whole life.
[time=995] - I didn't say that.
[time=996] - That's what you meant.
[time=998] - Yes, it is.
[time=999] - Man, it's hard to talk to you.
[time=1000] You know everything I'm thinking.
[time=1001] I'm just saying, you know, if you've done good work, you know, we can take a little break, a little time out, we'll come back to it.
[time=1006] - You know, what you're doing right now is common, it's called control.
[time=1008] Now, would you rather control the things in your life or can I chisel?
[time=1010] Control, chisel, control, chisel, control, chisel.
[time=1013] - Chisel, chisel.
[time=1014] - Okay.
[time=1015] - But can we chisel or I want to chisel?
[time=1017] - That's called control.
[time=1019] - Right.
[time=1020] - All right.
[time=1021] Are you sure you're ready for this?
[time=1023] You've been holding on this for a long time.
[time=1026] - Yeah?
[time=1026] - Okay, here we go.
[time=1029] (sighs) (upbeat music) - That hurts.
[time=1036] - It hurts me more than it hurts you.
[time=1037] - No, I don't think you understand this pain.
[time=1040] - Pain?
[time=1041] I know all about pain.
[time=1042] I sent my son to die on the cross for pain, for sin, but I did it for another reason.
[time=1048] I did it to bring you freedom.
[time=1050] Do you know what insanity is?
[time=1051] Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again but expecting different results.
[time=1056] And there are things in your life that you've been doing ever since high school that do not work in your life.
[time=1061] And you turn to these empty wells whenever you're hurting and whenever you're angry, whenever you're lonely, whenever you're tired and they don't work.
[time=1069] - Okay, but I'm thinking that maybe-- - Your thoughts are not my thoughts.
[time=1075] - But if we want another way-- - Your ways are not my ways.
[time=1079] - Okay, look, I can't be good.
[time=1081] - You can't be good.
[time=1082] I made you good.
[time=1085] Be good.
[time=1088] - What?
[time=1089] - Nothing.
[time=1090] - What is it?
[time=1091] - You wouldn't understand.
[time=1093] - I got of all the universe wouldn't understand something that one of my children has to say.
[time=1099] - Try me.
[time=1100] - It's just, God, I've let you down so much.
[time=1105] - No, you are never holding me up.
[time=1108] I hold you up with my victorious righteous right hand.
[time=1112] And this relationship, I hold you up.
[time=1114] Don't you forget that.
[time=1117] - Okay, chisel away.
[time=1120] But just be prepared for what you're gonna find in there.
[time=1125] 'Cause, God, I know what's inside there.
[time=1127] Because, God, I get up every morning and I look in the mirror and it's this scared little kid that gets up every day and tries to trust like an adult and act like an adult but just can't.
[time=1138] So, just be prepared for what you're gonna find in there.
[time=1142] - You have listened to too many voices for far too long that are not of me.
[time=1148] [MUSIC]
[time=1150] - You think you're junk, don't you?
[time=1154] You really, really think you're junk.
[time=1156] I don't make junk, what would that say about me?
[time=1160] How can I prove to you that my love for you has had no boundaries?
[time=1165] I know, reach into your back pocket.
[time=1168] - What?
[time=1169] - Reach into your back pocket.
[time=1171] - Why?
[time=1171] - What are you gonna argue with me?
[time=1172] Reach into your back pocket.
[time=1174] - God.
[time=1175] - Yes.
[time=1176] - I was just saying, God, I'll do that right now.
[time=1180] - You are just taking my name in vain.
[time=1182] - Look, it's just a name or a thing.
[time=1184] - It's more than a name and it's more than a saying and it's the name above all names.
[time=1190] I wanna teach you something about my name.
[time=1192] Reach into your back pocket.
[time=1193] Do you know what that is?
[time=1198] - It's a page for my journal ahead when I was a kid.
[time=1202] How did you get this?
[time=1203] - Hello.
[time=1204] - Oh, yeah.
[time=1205] - Go ahead and read it.
[time=1206] - I love Angie Holland.
[time=1211] - Other side.
[time=1212] - Oh, sorry.
[time=1214] I married her, you know.
[time=1215] - I was there.
[time=1216] - That's right.
[time=1217] - Yeah.
[time=1218] - Dear God, today I am turning everything over to you.
[time=1223] I am not gonna hold onto anything anymore.
[time=1227] Your word says that you will make me your masterpiece and use me to do great things.
[time=1235] I don't see how that's possible, but I want that with all that I am.
[time=1240] So please do whatever it takes to make me what you want.
[time=1245] I love you, God.
[time=1248] - I love you too, Tommy.
[time=1250] I love you too much to leave you where you are.
[time=1252] So the salvation that you hold, don't let it be some sentimental gush or some head knowledge.
[time=1258] I want you to work it out in every part of your life.
[time=1261] And don't compare yourself to others.
[time=1263] Let's just trivial nonsense.
[time=1265] You are my original masterpiece.
[time=1268] You are my workmanship and you, I find favor.
[time=1273] And this, don't look at this as a prison, but look at this as a father disciplining the ones he loves.
[time=1280] A father disciplines the ones he loves.
[time=1282] - I know, but it's gonna be tough.
[time=1284] - It is gonna be tough.
[time=1284] But you bought it into the lie that said that when you said yes to me, it was gonna be easy.
[time=1289] That's not how it works.
[time=1291] I want you to do something.
[time=1293] I want you to look out there and I want you to say, Tommy is God's original masterpiece.
[time=1298] (gentle music) - Tommy is God's original masterpiece.
[time=1304] - Not the way you see yourself or not the way you fear others see you, but the way that I see you.
[time=1310] (gentle music) - Tommy is God's original masterpiece.
[time=1321] - Yes, you are.
[time=1323] - And so are you.
[time=1324] God doesn't make junk.
[time=1327] You are an original masterpiece.
[time=1329] (gentle music) - Wow.
[time=1335] - That was a lot of work right there.
[time=1339] That was really, really well done.
[time=1341] [AMEN] Yeah.
[time=1343] (audience applauding) That is a, that's Ephesians 210.
[time=1351] And that is also very much a part of where we've been lately.
[time=1358] People realizing who God has called them to be and coming to a place of willingness and readiness to move away from idols and move toward all that God has called them to.
[time=1373] And I just am so grateful.
[time=1375] Thank you, church, for the time that we had to get a last Sunday morning.
[time=1379] Thank you for the courageous way.
[time=1382] Many of you were willing to be a family.
[time=1384] Thank you, church, for the way you received those who shared all that they shared.
[time=1390] I'm so grateful to be a part of a family that wants to grow and wants to be who God has called us to be.
[time=1397] And God has called you.
[time=1399] God has made you his workmanship, his masterpiece.
[time=1403] I can't wait to get to Ephesians 2 in our study.
[time=1406] Of Ephesians, can't wait to get there.
[time=1409] Can't wait to teach you more about that.
[time=1411] But I hope you are listening to every line of that drama.
[time=1415] What an amazing picture of what goes on in your heart and mind and my heart and mind way too many times.
[time=1423] And thank the Lord that God's word is there to remind us.
[time=1428] Thank God for the relationship we get to have with his son who reminds us.
[time=1434] Thank God for the spirit of God that reminds us and the word of God that reminds us that we're not junk, that we are special and unique in the way that we've been made.
[time=1446] And that is a great truth that we can celebrate today.
[time=1450] All right, Ephesians.
[time=1452] Ephesians, Ephesians, as we move away
[time=1458] from our six-week discussion and teaching on idols and idolatry and our need to repent.
[time=1466] And as we move on this morning to a new study in the book of Ephesians, I want you to take your Bibles if you would and open up to 1 John.
[time=1479] So I can read to you what the Apostle John says about idols.
[time=1483] It'll all make sense here in just a moment.
[time=1489] 1 John, chapter 5, verse 21, as you go to 1 John 5 21,
[time=1496] you'll notice just visually as you look at the page, you'll realize it's the very last statement in the entire epistle of 1 John, 1 John 5 21, where John says, "Little children," stop right there in the original language in the Greek, that little children would be translated, dear ones whom I love, dear ones whom I love greatly, dear ones who I have a passionate and deep love for, little children, he says, guard yourselves from what?
[time=1531] Say it out loud, idols, little children, dear ones who I love, guard yourselves from idols.
[time=1539] And so you ask yourself the question.
[time=1542] As many do who study this passage and look at this epistle, why does John seemingly sort of out of nowhere end his entire epistle with something he hasn't directly mentioned once in five chapters?
[time=1556] You read through first John, you'll find some indirect references, but there is no direct reference to guarding oneself from idolatry, from idols.
[time=1567] Now some will say that this final word of caution does relate to the context of the end of chapter five.
[time=1576] You understand context, what's said before or after a verse, it's the context.
[time=1582] Well, look at verses 19 through 21.
[time=1586] If you read 21 in light of 19 and 20, see what you think, 19.
[time=1593] We know that we are of God, John writes.
[time=1596] We know that we are of God and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
[time=1600] And we know that the son of God has come, Jesus, and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true.
[time=1609] And we are in him who is true in his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=1614] This is the true God and eternal life.
[time=1619] Little children guard yourselves from idols.
[time=1624] Now there's, if you look at that, there's some idolatry language there.
[time=1630] There's some panting after the true God.
[time=1634] There's some desiring the one who is real and right and true.
[time=1638] I can see that.
[time=1639] I'll admit one could make that connection.
[time=1642] It's not a stretch by any means.
[time=1645] But what I found, listen, what I found extremely compelling as I looked into this, was that many New Testament scholars believe that this final standalone plea of a conclusion has more to do with surroundings than it does context.
[time=1663] Watch this.
[time=1666] They believe that it's where John was writing from that leads him to as he closes his epistle, throw in this last plea.
[time=1679] That it was where he lived, John, literally, where he resided while writing first John that his surroundings and the influence of his surroundings and the influence of that culture bring him to this place where he can't keep it in any longer.
[time=1699] He has to almost blur it out, pick up a weapon, run for the hills, either way, guard yourself from idols.
[time=1707] It's very interesting.
[time=1714] Well, guess where John lived when he wrote first John?
[time=1719] Guess where he wrote from as he pleads against idols.
[time=1728] Guess why it's so important for us?
[time=1733] Guess why it's so timely for us?
[time=1737] Guess why it's just so right for you and I to study Ephesians after our study of idolatry.
[time=1746] Anybody wanna take a guess?
[time=1751] Because the Apostle John wrote first John 521, John wrote the entire epistle of first John from the city of Ephesus.
[time=1761] He writes from Ephesus.
[time=1766] It was an Ephesus that he wrote and it was the condition, it was the climate, if you will, the culture of Ephesus that most certainly inspires his warning.
[time=1778] And here's what I mean.
[time=1780] And I'm quoting here, "There was no city in the then known world that was as inundated by or connected to pagan worship.
[time=1789] The ancient gods and the system of living and worship that's connected to the ancient gods and the dark depths of idolatry than Ephesus." It was the third largest city in the world at that time, a port city through which a majority of all the world's trade and commerce traveled.
[time=1811] It was a world hub for finance, politics, education, the arts, entertainment and the occult.
[time=1820] It was a world hub for finance, politics, education,
[time=1826] the arts, entertainment and the occult.
[time=1828] It was a modern day mix of Vegas, New York City and Washington DC, all wrapped up into one.
[time=1836] Picture that.
[time=1837] And in no place were the occult
[time=1843] and idolatrous practices more overt and rampant than in the confines of that city's most treasured and famous landmark.
[time=1853] Anybody know what it was? The Temple of Diana.
[time=1857] The Temple of Diana, my friends.
[time=1861] You cannot, listen, you cannot begin.
[time=1864] Nobody should even think about beginning to look into the great truth of Ephesians.
[time=1870] You don't study the book of Ephesians.
[time=1872] You don't look at this letter from Paul to the Ephesians without taking time to understand the significance of this temple in the everyday lives of those who lived in this city.
[time=1885] And so I wanna introduce you if I can in just a few minutes this morning as we start to the Temple of Diana.
[time=1893] The Temple of Diana, while it was named one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt seven times in its history, each time on a scale larger and grander than before.
[time=1910] The wealthy King Croatia supplied it with many of its white stone columns and pilgrims and travelers from throughout the Oriental East, brought their wealth and their worship to Diana and her temple on a regular basis.
[time=1925] Thousands, tens of thousands of people would traffic through Ephesus on a regular basis from all over the then known world to bring their goods and their worship and their activity to Diana and this monstrosity of a temple.
[time=1943] In time, the temple possessed valuable lands in the region.
[time=1949] It controlled the fisheries.
[time=1952] Its priests were the bankers of its enormous revenues because of its strength and security the people stored their money there for safe keeping and in time it actually became a world bank, that's right.
[time=1966] Not only was the Temple of Diana a place of pagan worship and a treasure house for resources but it was also a museum as well in which the best statuary and most beautiful paintings were preserved.
[time=1980] The glory, my friends, the glory of a citizen of Ephesus was to be a worshipper of the great goddess, literally a caretaker or warden of her temple.
[time=1991] The temple of Diana was for those in Ephesus everything.
[time=1995] Now there were three main practices.
[time=2000] That comprised temple worship.
[time=2003] Three main practices that were central activities and realities there at the temple of Diana as we get a backdrop and a look into this city of Ephesus I want you to take note of these things.
[time=2015] Number one, the temple of Diana was the center of illicit and immoral sacrifices and ritualistic worship.
[time=2030] Now there's about, there's 15, 20 things I could tell you just from what I've read and learned about this.
[time=2040] And I know you've heard it all and I know in our culture and in our day on this front there's not a whole lot that surprises us.
[time=2050] But I'm here to tell you if I told y'all 15 or 20 it'd shake you, the things that were going on.
[time=2061] And the stuff that took place openly on a regular basis in the name of worship and God and religion.
[time=2068] One of the things, one of the things I could share this, virgins, virgins from Ephesus could come at any point in time, any day of the week.
[time=2082] If you were a virgin in Ephesus, didn't matter how old you were, you could come in for a price, offer yourself sexually to a temple worshipper, a male temple visitor.
[time=2097] The young girls would then having performed that act.
[time=2102] The young girls would then give the money that they made from doing that act to the temple authorities as an act of worship on the girls part to Diana.
[time=2113] With the promise of blessing and ongoing protection for their lives.
[time=2118] So go to the temple, pay for a virgin.
[time=2123] In that sense, the temple authorities became nothing more than revered pimps.
[time=2128] Happened all the time, constantly.
[time=2134] Number two, the temple of Diana had established the right of asylum.
[time=2141] This was interesting, I didn't know this.
[time=2143] The temple of Diana had established the right for that culture and that region and that time, the right of asylum.
[time=2149] Which means any criminal in that day.
[time=2151] Guilty of any crime, no matter how severe or twisted.
[time=2155] If he could reach the temple steps at the temple of Diana was safe.
[time=2160] No charges could be brought, no prosecution could come.
[time=2164] The result was that the temple was a home for hardened criminals.
[time=2170] Tastidists and early church father accused Ephesus of protecting the crimes of men and calling it the worship of the gods.
[time=2177] To have anything then to do with the temple of Diana was to be associated with, to be in the company of, to be close to, to be in relationship with the very drugs of society.
[time=2188] Many of whom were more than ready to pay for a worshipful visit with a virgin.
[time=2193] And on and on, it went.
[time=2196] Center of illicit and immoral sacrifice
[time=2202] and ritualistic worship, home for criminals through the establishment of asylum.
[time=2208] And number three, and this is not only extremely interesting but very, very pertinent to what we're about to see and where we're about to go in our study of Ephesians.
[time=2219] Number three, the temple of Diana was the center of the sale of Ephesian letters they called them.
[time=2228] Ephesian letters, these were charms worn as amulets which were supposed to be, listen, they were supposed to be effective in bringing about blessing.
[time=2239] I mean, if you're writing down words, write down that word.
[time=2244] If you wanna store a word in your mind, store that word in your mind.
[time=2247] These people were all about blessing.
[time=2250] They wanted to be blessed and they wore these amulets with the hope of being blessed.
[time=2257] The wishes of those who wore them were to come true.
[time=2261] Ephesus was, and I quote, preeminently, the city of astrology and sorcery and incantations and amulets and exorcisms and every form of magical imposter to have anything to do with the temple at Ephesus was to be brought into contact with commercialized superstition, illicit prostitution and the black arts.
[time=2286] This was Diana and this was that world.
[time=2290] This was Ephesus in that day and it dominated the scene.
[time=2295] It would be impossible for us today to imagine how much into what extent Ephesus and the Ephesians were influenced by the activity in the mindset of the temple of Diana.
[time=2310] Okay, did you get all that now with that?
[time=2316] Now with that as a backdrop.
[time=2319] That's what's going on.
[time=2321] That's where we are.
[time=2323] Here's our new study.
[time=2324] These are the people.
[time=2326] This is the city and this is what's going down.
[time=2329] What an enormous, think about it, what an enormous challenge for young believers let alone a young church.
[time=2336] Can you imagine being in a church down the street from the temple of Diana?
[time=2342] What an incredible challenge for young believers in a young church to live every day in the midst of that culture with all of its dark, accessible and incessant temptations.
[time=2353] Sound familiar?
[time=2356] I mean, I know it's different, but you and I both know it's, it's not.
[time=2362] Why study the book of Ephesians?
[time=2367] To live every day in the midst of that culture
[time=2374] with all of its dark, accessible and incessant temptations, carnal and empty blessings to be had anywhere with anyone at any time.
[time=2387] And so back to John.
[time=2389] John from Ephesus says, guard yourselves from idols.
[time=2394] And Paul, Paul who actually writes Ephesians who ministered there for almost three years and was himself quite familiar with its setting and context, quite familiar with Diana, quite familiar with the going ons at the temple, quite familiar with how it all worked and played out.
[time=2413] Paul says, right out of the gate, watch this, go to Ephesians one, verse three.
[time=2420] And I wanna read Ephesians one, verse three with you.
[time=2423] And many of you have read Ephesians one, three for a lot of years, but I wonder with all of that as a backdrop, I wonder if Ephesians one, three might sound a little bit different to you this morning.
[time=2436] It sure does, it sure does for me.
[time=2439] Ephesians one, three, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has what?
[time=2448] There's that word, say it out loud.
[time=2450] Blessed us, everybody was looking for a blessing.
[time=2454] Everybody today, still looking for a blessing.
[time=2459] And here Paul says to those dear brothers and sisters and Ephesians who live in the shadow of Diana, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual what?
[time=2475] Say it out loud, blessing in the heavenly places in who, in Christ.
[time=2486] I read that verse after reading everything I just read to you and studying all that I've studied these last several weeks.
[time=2494] And it just, it pops like never before.
[time=2498] It's like you can just see Paul speaking to those people who live in the shadow of that temple, trying to be the people God's called them to be, reminding them of what he has given them, reminding them of what's true and real about their condition in the midst of that kind of culture.
[time=2517] Let's just look at a few things this morning.
[time=2520] Praise, look at verse one there.
[time=2522] Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2525] That means praise God, praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2530] And just to be clear, it's as if he's saying, and just to be clear, not Diana.
[time=2535] This isn't about Diana, this isn't about all that you see and all that you hear every day of your life and you and I could today in our context, just pick a God, pick a little G God.
[time=2545] Don't praise it, he says, don't praise Diana, praise.
[time=2548] No, praise is due to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2554] Who has says there, who has?
[time=2559] And I want you to stop there just for a moment.
[time=2563] And as you just chew on the great truth of this verse, in order to really take it in, I want you to jump to the bottom of the verse.
[time=2574] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2578] Who has, and then go down to the last two words
[time=2585] of the verse, which are what?
[time=2588] In who, in Christ.
[time=2591] It's very important that you understand this today.
[time=2593] And I know for some of you, this might be redundant.
[time=2597] For others of you, it may just be the thing you needed to hear for some reason today, but none of what we're about to talk about.
[time=2606] None of the blessings that God brings.
[time=2611] None of the life that God offers, none of the benefits and the joys, none of all that God brings to the life of one that's depicted here in Ephesians 1.
[time=2626] None of it is possible.
[time=2628] None of it will ever be realized.
[time=2630] You'll never touch it, you'll never see it, you'll never taste it.
[time=2633] It'll never be yours unless you are in who?
[time=2638] Christ.
[time=2642] In Christ.
[time=2644] Praise be to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2649] Who has in Christ.
[time=2652] And I want to just ask you this morning.
[time=2657] If you're in Christ, really in Christ, have you come to that place where you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him, fully devoted yourself to following after his ways and his teaching and his truth.
[time=2672] Because when you fully surrender your heart and life to him, not to religion, not to a church membership, not to what mom and dad taught you, but when you fully give yourself in submission to him to follow and love and give your life to him, what he brings and what he offers and what he establishes in you.
[time=2699] It's mind boggling, we're about to study it for the next few months.
[time=2704] But none of it, none of it will ever be a reality
[time=2710] for you if you're outside of and not in Christ.
[time=2715] Well, let's look and see what happens with those who are in Christ.
[time=2720] Praise God, not Diana, who has in Christ blessed us
[time=2726] with everything.
[time=2728] I love how the text reads, blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[time=2735] Every spiritual blessing, important that you just stop there and think about that for a moment.
[time=2742] And in the context of that day and the context of their lives and the context of what they'd seen in the temple of Diana, it's not temple hookers, it's not black magic potions, it's not illicit barbaric acts of sacrifice.
[time=2755] No, God brings every spiritual blessing, spiritual blessing, that would be something that's lasting.
[time=2764] That would be something that's eternal, that would be something that's meaningful, that would be something that's life-giving, something lasting, something eternal, something meaningful, something life-giving.
[time=2778] He has blessed you with every spiritual blessing and with the context, what the text really says there is, he's blessed you with every spiritual blessing that is available to God.
[time=2795] In the heavenlies, and it's so huge of a truth and it's such an amazing concept.
[time=2803] I actually, I struggle to even explain to you what it really means.
[time=2810] I don't know that I can.
[time=2812] The heavenlies, the heavenly places, that speaks to, if you will, and I hate to even use this phrase 'cause he's so beyond this, but that's God's account.
[time=2823] That's his account, you and I have accounts.
[time=2826] Some of them are overdrawn, some of them are really small, some of them struggle at times, they're not very big, some have big accounts, I understand that, but we're talking about the resources, all of the resources that God can in his divine nature draw from, it's his warehouse, it's his storehouse, it's his account of every spiritual blessing and gift and reward that he could ever imagine, he gives to you.
[time=2855] Every spiritual blessing, it's just vast, it's unspeakable.
[time=2862] I mean, it's a bad illustration, it really is
[time=2868] 'cause it doesn't even measure up, but it's like, I found out this morning Bill Gates is worth $40 billion.
[time=2876] I Googled, we Googled it back in the back.
[time=2879] It was $52 billion last year, but he had a really bad year and lost 18, and I know you feel bad for him.
[time=2886] So he's down to $40 billion, it's like Bill Gates
[time=2892] waking up one day and saying, all right, I'm gonna just dedicate the rest of my life to meeting, just to meeting Rick's needs.
[time=2902] I'm going to exist to meet Andy's needs.
[time=2907] Andy, I'm all yours, I'm Bill Gates, I'm all yours Andy, what do you need?
[time=2911] And it's like Andy thinking about that for a little bit and going, you know what Bill?
[time=2915] Can I get 200 bucks?
[time=2917] You know what I mean?
[time=2920] Andy's just 200 bucks, we all just kinda gassed like, oh Andy, come on, you missed that one because we know there's so much there and it's a bad illustration, but my point is you can't even fathom how much is there in the heavenlies that he says he, now watch the text here and he doesn't says he's going to, the text says that if you're in Christ, he has.
[time=2943] It's in your account, he has blessed you,
[time=2949] he has deposited into your heart and into your life and into your reality, every spiritual blessing that he has to give, he has given to you in Christ.
[time=2961] It's an amazing thought, all of those blessings
[time=2967] given to you and I, everything the heavenlies have to offer and so now we get back to the last six weeks, now you see why this is so cool how it all lines up, where we've been, where we're going, why would you, now I'm gonna sound like I sounded four or five weeks ago, why would you with every spiritual blessing conceivable available to you in Christ nibble at the table of the world?
[time=2997] Why worship an idol, why spend your days hoping food
[time=3005] or booze or the pursuit of the perfect body or your own arrogant self-sufficiency will bring you blessing the one thing they wanted and the one thing you and I still want.
[time=3016] When God, Paul says, right out of the gate, wants to bless you with every blessing available in his account, we came to the realization over the past few weeks that we are idolaters.
[time=3036] So many of you were willing to stand in front of your family last week and admit that very thing with specifics attached.
[time=3048] We've been captivated by our culture's preoccupation with little G gods, just like an Ephesus.
[time=3056] And Paul writes to the Ephesians, to a people who were surrounded by idolatry and little G gods who couldn't bring blessings, only emptiness, only heartache, only loss.
[time=3068] Idolatry always leads to what we told you?
[time=3072] Destruction.
[time=3072] And Paul says, you know what, praise be to God.
[time=3077] Those of you that know him because you know and you're aware of the fact that every spiritual blessing
[time=3086] has been made available to you and you can ask and others have over the years, what are the blessings?
[time=3092] Now my friends, that's where I want to invite you to come back next week and for the weeks to come because we will, in the weeks to come as we study this amazing letter, we will identify specifically the blessings, the gifts that God has given you.
[time=3110] It's gonna be an amazing study and we're gonna take a careful and close look.
[time=3115] Watch this, we're gonna take a careful and close look at these blessings that God has brought.
[time=3120] See chapters one, two and three are all about what God has accomplished in you when he saved you, when he redeemed you, theologically, doctrinally, practically, everything he has brought to the table, so to speak, everything he has deposited in you spiritually.
[time=3138] We're gonna learn about in those first three chapters of Ephesians, how he's built you up, how he's put this package together, if you will, so that we can get to, and I can't wait for this to get to chapter four, five and six, we're in a very practical, very honest way.
[time=3157] He says, okay, now it's time to learn how to live that out, how you were made, what God deposited into you, how he has positioned you spiritually, now we're gonna talk about the practice of that in your everyday life, and I promise you, the things that we're gonna talk about, the things that the text talks about, the teaching that we're gonna be able to dive into on the everyday of life front, it's staggering,
[time=3188] it's so real and honest and important for you and I, we're gonna talk about how our position in Christ, how the blessings and the truth about how we've been made
[time=3204] and what God did to us when he redeemed us, how that should carry out and impact our unity as a body,
[time=3213] our, it's gonna talk about how we're supposed to live out our faith in an immoral world.
[time=3221] Ephesians five, one, two, talks about there not even being a hint of immorality among us.
[time=3231] Later in five, we're gonna spend probably a few weeks talking about marriage, how husbands and wives are to relate, how husbands and wives are to, to be in relationship with each other in a way that fulfills God's design for that relationship.
[time=3248] We're gonna talk about parents and kids, we're gonna talk about employers and employees, we're gonna talk about the armor of God in chapter six that we need every day to live in a world that's absolutely fraught with demonic attempts to dissuade and diminish and discourage you and I.
[time=3271] It's gonna be an incredible study and I can't wait for you to be a part of it.
[time=3276] One, two and three, the truth, the truth about
[time=3282] what has happened inside of you if you're in Christ.
[time=3288] Chapters four, five and six, the way you and I are to live in light of what went on inside of us and when you marry the truth about what God did in you and the way in which we're supposed to live, you get then and only then the life that God intended.
[time=3306] The truth, the way, the life, somebody else talked
[time=3312] about that I think, his name was Jesus.
[time=3316] Remember that, John 14, six, I am the way.
[time=3321] This one that we're in said I am the way,
[time=3327] the truth and the life.
[time=3329] No man comes to the Father but through me and so it is him who we will follow in the days to come.
[time=3336] [AMEN] Would you stand and let me pray for us as we go this morning, Father in heaven.
[time=3342] God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[time=3350] who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in your Son, how grateful we are.
[time=3359] I'm so thankful this morning for Corey and for Jared
[time=3366] and the way they gave themselves to that drama today, the great picture of you at work in us and on us and for us.
[time=3375] And oh God, I pray that the people of this church would in the days to come have the courage to stand on that stool God and allow your loving chisel to shape us and form us into the people that you've called us to be.
[time=3391] Oh God, how grateful we are for your word.
[time=3394] It is life changing, eternity altering.
[time=3398] And I pray God that we would surrender ourselves to it.
[time=3401] I pray that we would bring ourselves to this gathering week after week after week, to allow your spirit and your word and your people to encourage us toward that, which you've made us to be masterpieces.
[time=3416] You've designed us to be masterpieces who in our own unique worlds, where we work, where we live, God, there's a way that you've called us to function.
[time=3428] There are things you've designed us to do.
[time=3432] And God, we want to function that way and do those things and we know we desperately need your help.
[time=3439] And so God, we commit as a family to come before you.
[time=3443] We commit to the digging deeper resources that will allow us in the days to come to continue this discussion, to keep your word and it's truth, parts of the scripture we didn't even get to today that have to do with these truths we've considered.
[time=3460] Oh God, would we as a people be committed to keeping those things in front of us, keeping those things in front of our kids and our families and our friends?
[time=3470] God, walk with us through these days as we pursue the truth and the way and the life that you've called us to and we'll thank you for it.
[time=3479] And all the people in the room agreed and said, (upbeat music)
[time=3493] (upbeat music)
