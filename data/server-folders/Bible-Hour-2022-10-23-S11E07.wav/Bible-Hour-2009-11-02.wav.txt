[time=480] - Well, hello everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=489] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=494] And as always, we're so thankful that you've tuned in today.
[time=497] As you can tell, I'm dressed for November.
[time=502] What an amazing weekend we've had and I've got my swimming suit on and there's a reason for that.
[time=507] And I just want you to know, this morning in our services, I'll have the privilege of conducting several baptisms and baptisms for us here at Blackhawk are just one of the most special amazing celebrations that we could ever imagine or participate in.
[time=523] Baptism is an amazing thing for a number of reasons.
[time=526] One is that it represents new life.
[time=529] And I think most of you know this.
[time=531] It's why we do what we do.
[time=533] It's why I've given my life to this great endeavor called the church with the great hope and the realization that God uses our efforts as feeble as they are at times to bring people to faith in his son.
[time=546] And when they come to faith in his son, their lives are changed forever.
[time=551] Many of you in our Bible Hour viewing audience, you know what I'm talking about.
[time=555] You've experienced that transformation.
[time=558] So today I'll stand in those waters in my blue swimming suit here and we will celebrate those who have come to faith in recent days and we will thank God for the privilege he's given us to play just a small part in that.
[time=573] Baptism is also an amazing thing because it allows those who are being baptized to now identify in kind of a formal and informal way, in a very personal way really with a family.
[time=586] Those people in the water, they stand there and they proclaim their love for Jesus Christ, their thankfulness for the salvation that he has made possible.
[time=595] And they say to the Blackhawk family, I wanna walk through life with you.
[time=601] I want your support, I want your accountability.
[time=604] I wanna face all that there is to face with a family who will be by me, who will pray for me.
[time=610] And it's an amazing experience.
[time=612] I can't wait to see again today what it will be like in those waters with those dear people.
[time=618] And I wanna say this to you, with that as kind of a backdrop.
[time=622] And I do this every, I don't know, a couple times a year.
[time=625] I just have the privilege of looking into this camera and into the eyes and the hearts of so many of you who I know watch week after week.
[time=634] And while there are many of you who watch and you've experienced that life transformation, you've been redeemed, you've come to a saving realization of the gift that God gave you in his son Jesus Christ and you're a fully surrendered follower of Christ.
[time=652] There are others of you who watch week after week and you know what, you're not.
[time=657] You're just not yet, you haven't come to that point where you've been willing to respond to the Spirit of God and draw that line in the sand and put that stake in the ground and give your life, all of it, not just part of it, but all of it to him.
[time=673] And I just wanna ask you today, I wanna ask you to continue to think about what it would be like to be in relationship with the living God who formed you and created you, what it would be like to have a life that was full of meaning and peace and forgiveness.
[time=690] We would love, love nothing more than to encourage you and to walk with you toward a life-changing, eternity-altering relationship with him and I wanna just invite you, like I do many times.
[time=702] I wanna invite you to come, come and be with us on a Sunday morning at nine or 1045.
[time=708] Come and sit in the room.
[time=710] We're thankful that you've watched, but now maybe for you, it's time to come and be with us live and in person, what a great gift it would be to us.
[time=718] To have you come, let us put a name with a face and allow us the privilege of introducing you to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=726] We hope you'll come and God bless you.
[time=728] Have a great, great week.
[time=730] (gentle music)
[time=736] Let's sing this with me.
[time=737] [MUSIC - 188 seconds]
[time=929] Blessed be your name, blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be your glorious name.
[time=959] [MUSIC]
[time=988] I say the king of glory, coming on the clouds we fight.
[time=998] The whole of shapes, the whole of shapes, it is.
[time=1013] I say his love and mercy, washing over all our sin.
[time=1023] The people sing, the people sing.
[time=1030] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[time=1060] I say your generation, rising up to take their place, we're selfless faith, we're selfless faith.
[time=1078] I say a new revival, stirring as we pray and sing, we're on our knees, we're on our knees.
[time=1096] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[time=1122] [MUSIC]
[time=1143] Heal my heart and make it clear, please open up my eyes to the things unseen.
[time=1156] Show me how the love like you have loved me.
[time=1168] And break my heart for a great source.
[time=1175] Everything I have for your king knows close.
[time=1181] Because I walk from earth into eternity.
[time=1198] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[time=1260] Well hey, open your Bibles this morning if you would.
[time=1263] To the book of Ephesians, what a great beginning we had to our series last week.
[time=1269] And I'm so looking forward to continuing on this morning and in the Sundays to come.
[time=1274] Somebody asked me how many weeks we're going to be in Ephesians.
[time=1277] My answer was honestly I have no idea.
[time=1279] We haven't put an ending date to it.
[time=1281] We will break in December for some Christmas celebration and teaching.
[time=1286] But we'll be back at it in January and we're going to just keep going through Ephesians until we get done.
[time=1291] I hope that's okay.
[time=1292] But I can't wait to see what God has for us.
[time=1295] In this amazing letter from Paul to the church at Ephesus, we've entitled our series, The Truth, The Way, The Life.
[time=1302] A study in the book of Ephesians.
[time=1305] And if you would, in honor of God's word, would you stand and let me read to you this morning, Ephesians chapter 1, verses 1 and 2.
[time=1315] Ephesians chapter 1 verses 1 and 2, where it says Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God.
[time=1326] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God to the saints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus.
[time=1338] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1345] Pray with me, would you Father God, we simply come before you this morning here in this moment and we pray God.
[time=1351] We beg you, please, to unleash your spirit and your word and the life transforming, heart transforming work that they alone can do.
[time=1362] God, we want to be changed.
[time=1364] We want to be a people who in relationship with your son are molded and shaped into his very image.
[time=1371] And we know God that we are in and of ourselves incapable and unable to do that.
[time=1377] And we know God that is your spirit and it is your truth that forms us and shapes us and molds us.
[time=1384] So do that today, we pray as we continue in this study, this great truth from Ephesians that paints this picture of our salvation and what we can do with it in the days to come.
[time=1398] Please, God, be with us and be honored by our time today in your son's name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated.
[time=1407] Hey, I want to point something out to you before we jump in any further this morning.
[time=1410] I want to take you right back to verse 1. Would you look there with me Ephesians 1.
[time=1415] Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God to the who.
[time=1420] Say it out loud, please.
[time=1422] To the saints. Say it again. To the who. To the saints.
[time=1426] Oftentimes this word comes with a number of different preconceived notions of what it means to be a saint.
[time=1433] I would suspect most of you when you hear this phrase. And again, he writes to the saints at Ephesus.
[time=1439] But we know as we've grown accustomed to studying God's word that we make application here to us as well.
[time=1445] So really he's writing not only to the saints at Ephesus, but to the saints of Blackhawk.
[time=1452] So I say to you, are you a saint? Do you view yourself as a saint?
[time=1456] Do you understand yourself to be a saint? And oftentimes the preconceived notions lead us to say no, I'm not a saint
[time=1463] because we think saints are these pristine and pure and kind of nicely packaged with a bow and everything is just like it's supposed to be.
[time=1472] And we know that's not us, so we say no, I'm not a saint.
[time=1475] Well, I want you to understand this morning really important that you understand as we jump into this study.
[time=1482] He writes to saints, and a saint is somebody who by virtue of the very definition of the word a saint, my friends, is someone who is set apart.
[time=1494] I want you to write this down. A saint is one who is set apart. A saint is one who is separate.
[time=1503] A saint is one who is distinctly different from the context within which he or she lives. Did you hear that?
[time=1515] You see, a saint is unique. And a saint is one who because of his or her relationship with Jesus Christ and because of what God has done in him, in her, they are able to.
[time=1528] It's made possible because of what God has done for them to live in their context wherever that might be.
[time=1538] And what's so cool about this is that last week we spent the entire morning helping you understand what the context was.
[time=1546] And my friends, the context for these people wasn't pretty, was it?
[time=1551] It was a debauched and immoral and illicit culture filled with unspeakable acts, barbaric pagan worship and illicit immoral stuff going on in the great temple of Diana.
[time=1566] And in the midst of that culture and that city with all of that as a backdrop, he says he writes to the saints who are separate, set apart, distinct.
[time=1580] You're with me? And he writes to you and me. He writes to you and me and he calls you, if you know him, he calls you saint.
[time=1592] Because what's assumed is that in your relationship with his son, if you have that, what's assumed is that that's how you're living.
[time=1604] That when they look at you, when they watch your family, when they see you at work in the cubicle, when they watch you on the ball field, when they see the way you conduct yourselves
[time=1616] in the everyday of your life, we're assuming that you're different, that you're distinct.
[time=1623] Are you separated from them? This culture and this context that God's put you in, no, literally, physically, geographically?
[time=1631] You know God's word, in fact, tells us we're to be in, but not of.
[time=1636] And we can be in and not of. And we can live lives by virtue of the choices we make that set us apart and make us what?
[time=1646] Saints. It was amazing. Recently, I had this lesson taught to me all over again by my own son.
[time=1654] And I told you a few weeks ago about the visit we took up to East Lansing. It was his official visit. And we told you about some of the things that we experienced.
[time=1661] But I didn't tell you about this. It was an incredible experience for both my wife and I, just to thank God and to see the growth and progress in our own son's life.
[time=1671] You know, the first night we were up there. And I knew it was coming. I didn't say anything to her. I should have kind of caught her by surprise.
[time=1678] But the first night we were up there, we were all out to dinner, coaches and team and recruits in the whole nine yards.
[time=1683] And after dinner, the team takes the recruits and they go out for the night.
[time=1691] And they came over and said goodbye at the tables and Russell gave us a hug and a kiss and he kind of winked at us and off he went out for the night.
[time=1703] We went back to the hotel and he had a room there at the hotel with us. This was right next to ours.
[time=1710] And they told us we would see him in the morning. That's kind of a weird deal, you know, first time out.
[time=1718] But we believed in our hearts that, you know, he would do his best and so we went to bed and tried to sleep and woke up early.
[time=1727] And he comes rolling in, 830, all dressed, showered. Big smile on his face.
[time=1733] Well, hey, bud, how'd it go? And he said, oh, I went great. Big smile. He sits down in the end of our bed.
[time=1739] He says, here's how it went. And he says, we got to where we were going and he said, Dad, Mom, it was packed with over 100 students.
[time=1747] It was a huge party. And it was all going on and the music's thumping and the guys and the gals are there.
[time=1753] And these guys that he was with, they just pulled him aside and not with a high heavy-handed pressure type thing.
[time=1759] They just pulled him aside and say, hey, what do you want to do? It's your weekend. What do you want to do tonight?
[time=1764] And they said, do you want to get drunk? Do you want to get some girls?
[time=1771] And he said, man, he said, I just said it was amazing. It was like in that moment, all of a sudden, everything I'd been thinking about
[time=1778] all the prayers that we'd been praying about, how I would respond and all the stuff you guys and Black Hawk Church and Black Hawk Christian School had taught me. It was like it all came together in this one moment.
[time=1787] And he said, I just, with all the calmness, I couldn't believe it. I just looked at him and said, no, not really.
[time=1795] And they said, well, what do you want to do? And he said, that kind of caught me by surprise.
[time=1800] And so I'm thinking about what I wanted to do and all I could think about was all the fun things, Dad, Mom, all the fun things
[time=1806] we always did and I thought, oh my gosh, he asked him to play rough house.
[time=1810] (Laughter) And he said, I just asked him if they like to play cards. And they said, yeah, we love to play cards.
[time=1819] So we played cards. He said, we play cards till two in the morning. It was great.
[time=1824] And they took him to the hotel and he went upstairs and put his key in the door and went to bed.
[time=1830] And I say that to you because in that moment there, and he's no different than you.
[time=1837] And you don't have to be at East Lansing.
[time=1840] This happens to you and this happens to me every day. We get opportunities in this world of ours, in this context that we're in.
[time=1847] In office cubicles and ball fields and grocery stores and times with our families, we get opportunities to be saints.
[time=1858] Separate. In but not of. Unique. Distinct.
[time=1864] And I don't know how he'll do on that in the days to come. Certainly grateful for his choice that night.
[time=1870] But I know this. You and I have an opportunity to live out this great salvation that God has given us.
[time=1876] And Paul right from the get-go says, hey, separate ones.
[time=1880] Hey, distinct ones. Hey, different ones right there in the shadows of Diana.
[time=1888] I'm writing to you set apart and holy ones.
[time=1893] I'm convinced the question to ask is, do I look more like Christ or more like the culture?
[time=1900] And you should ask yourself that question today. Do you look more like him?
[time=1905] And the choices and the values that you hold on to or do you look more like culture?
[time=1910] Well, last week as we began our study of the book of Ephesians, we saw the Apostle Paul beginning to speak life-giving truth into the hearts and lives of young believers.
[time=1919] This young church that was surrounded by and inundated with so much, the very same challenges and temptations that you and I face today.
[time=1929] Idolatry, idolatry was everywhere.
[time=1937] Idolatry was everywhere. And the blessings we talked about, the blessings that these people were so hungry for and the blessings of idolatry in the city of Ephesus.
[time=1946] Pleasure and fulfillment and joy was available to all.
[time=1951] Ephesus was filled with, and you can write these things in. Ephesus was filled with wealth and resources, immorality and illicit activity.
[time=1958] Black magic and the occult, pagan worship, and all there was to experience at the great temple of Diana.
[time=1965] And my friends, it's all of this that Paul has in mind as he comes to Ephesians 1.
[time=1975] And as he comes to Ephesians 1, I love this, he throws this doctrinal, practical counter-punch right into the mix.
[time=1984] It's as if he's saying, hang on my friends, living in the shadow of Diana, hang on, you want to talk about blessings?
[time=1990] You want to talk about real lasting eternal, meaningful blessings, real joy, real peace, real pleasure, then read, then read this, he says.
[time=2002] Read this. Ephesians 1 to 3, the first three chapters that describe and explain the truth about the blessing of your faith.
[time=2013] The blessing, the truth about your salvation, and all that comes with it, everything that comes with your salvation, he says it's right here.
[time=2024] Understand the truth about your salvation, and all that comes with it, three chapters, one to three, about your position, your standing, what God has done in you as he's placed you in the family of God.
[time=2038] And then three chapters, Ephesians 4, 5, and 6, about the way, the way you live out that faith.
[time=2045] Three chapters about practicing in the day-to-day of life, on college campuses and in your home and in your workplace and in your marriage, and with your parenting.
[time=2058] And as an employer and as an employee, and the 4, 5, and 6 list goes on and on, I can't wait for us to get there.
[time=2066] The practicing of your faith based upon your position in the family of God, and when you understand and embrace this truth, and when the way you live reflects it, then that's the life.
[time=2082] All my friends, that is the life, that's living. Like you never imagined, you could, that's living the way God designed you to live, the way, the truth, the life.
[time=2099] And here's the great reminder, Church, here is the great reminder, all that stuff you wrote on those cards, three weeks ago, many of you were here, all the stuff you wrote on those cards.
[time=2111] And all the idolatrous sin, so many of you courageously confessed publicly, right here in this room two weeks ago.
[time=2120] None of it will ever lead you, right? None of it will ever lead you to that life, the life that deep down in your soul you long to live.
[time=2130] Only thing that will ever bring you the life is the truth and the way, and all of that is found only in one person, the Lord Jesus Christ, who said in John 14, 6, I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=2145] No man comes to the Father but by me, and Ephesians is this incredible letter where we see again and again and again, especially here at the beginning about the blessings of being in Christ.
[time=2162] The blessings of our faith. Let's get started. What do you say? Let's look at the truth. The blessings of our faith. And as we make our way through verses 3 to 14, and I hope you'll read verses 3 to 14 several times.
[time=2178] You should do that this week. You should read Ephesians 1, 3 to 14 several times this week. And as you make your way through those verses, you'll see as it relates to your salvation, you'll see past blessings, a friend pointed this out to me this week.
[time=2193] You'll see past blessings that have to do with God the Father, I hope you'll write this down, verses 3 to 6. You'll see present blessings that have to do with God the Son, and you'll see future blessings.
[time=2206] The blessings of our faith, past, present and future blessings which have to do with God the Holy Spirit verses 12 to 14. So let's jump in this morning. What do you say?
[time=2218] Past blessing number one. Let's look at the blessings of our faith as delineated by Paul to the church at Ephesus to the saints who are set apart. Number one, past blessing. We were chosen.
[time=2231] There you go. Write that down. Past blessing number one. This having to do with the work of God the Father in the work of salvation. We were chosen.
[time=2240] There's three things I want you to see about God's choosing of His people. You ready? Three things I want you to write down about God's choosing of His people. The first thing is the person.
[time=2250] And I know this might be just clearly, just plainly obvious to many of us, but I think it's worth noting and I think it's worth talking about just for a moment.
[time=2260] Who is it the person? Who is it that did in the salvation conversation? Who is it that did the choosing? Who is it that did the choosing? And I believe the Scriptures teaches that God first, God chose us.
[time=2280] And you know what? It's interesting. Paul who writes the letter of Ephesians. Paul of all people would have known this. Paul of all people would have been aware of how in this salvation deal it's God who chooses. I mean, did Paul choose God or did God choose Paul?
[time=2298] God chose Paul. Many of you know the story of Paul who used to be who? Saul who was in the early days of the church as it begins to blossom and flourish in and outside of Jerusalem.
[time=2311] Saul the Pharisee is the number one enemy of the church. Saul is the one who hates God. Saul is the one who persecutes and tortures and murders early followers of Christ.
[time=2322] It's Saul who's on his way to persecute and tortures some more of them who on the Damascus road in Acts 9, you should read it, Acts 9, write that down.
[time=2331] It's an amazing story where God just on his own initiative appears and puts an end to that part of Saul's life and brings him to faith and salvation and introduces him to his new calling, which wasn't to kill the church but to grow it.
[time=2349] God shows up. God initiates and God chooses Paul. He would have been very, very aware of this. Jesus echoes the same sentiment.
[time=2362] We see it not only in God the Father but Jesus as well. Look at John the Gospel of John. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and your Bibles. Look at John 15.
[time=2372] Look at John 15, 16. Here, Jesus in a discussion with the disciples says, "You did not choose me. You did not, John 15, 16. You did not choose me but I chose you and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit and that your fruit would remain so that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you."
[time=2398] John 15, 16. We could go to verse after verse after verse. In the Scriptures, my friend that remind you and I that on this choosing front it was God who chose you, that it was God who chose me.
[time=2415] And it was God who called me to himself and initiated that. Jesus and Hebrews called the author and initiator and perfecter, the author and perfecter of our faith on the salvation end when it comes to this choice of a people. It is God who chooses first.
[time=2437] Second thing I want you to see about this choosing of his people by God is the place. So important to understand this and it might sound high and lofty but oh my friends it's so practical.
[time=2449] The implications are so every day for you and I. The place of his choosing, write this down, eternity passed before the foundations of the world.
[time=2463] world before there was anything, before there was anyone in eternity past which you, it's
[time=2471] hard to even imagine eternity having a past. But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[time=2477] wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait back there before anything ever began. God, the Scriptures teach, chose you. If you know Him today, if you've fully surrendered your heart and
[time=2490] life to Him, you have this amazing assurance that before the foundations of the world He chose you. Now why, why? Listen, why is that so important? Why is it so important that we make such a big deal out of the fact that He chose you and He chose you before the foundations of the world? Because if He chose you before the foundations of the world, then His choice
[time=2510] of you had nothing to do with your last performance. How's that? Doesn't matter how good you were.
[time=2521] It doesn't matter where you went. It doesn't matter what you did. His choice of you took place far before you ever did anything. So what's implied is that His choice of you has
[time=2532] nothing to do with merit. It has nothing to do about what you earned or could have earned.
[time=2538] It has only to do with His gracious goodness and His love that before the foundations of
[time=2544] the world no matter what you did or where you were going to go or what family you came from or what detours you took, He chose you. Wow. This was big for me. When I first learned
[time=2562] this, you know why? Number of reasons. One was? And I've told you this story before.
[time=2570] When I was eight years old on the playground at school, I had this head and these ears, I was basically this tall and I weighed 200 pounds less. Seriously, I never got picked.
[time=2586] Never got picked for anything. I was a mess. I was awkward. I was awkward socially. I was
[time=2592] awkward physically. I was awkward athletically. I was always the last kid standing against the fence. And I remember even as a young man when I came to Christ at the age of 20,
[time=2603] how amazing it was. You know, and I had gone through some things at that point with my own father. I'm so grateful that God has graciously allowed He and I to just work those
[time=2613] things out over the years. And He and I are in this really good relationship these days.
[time=2620] But in those days, you know, I had never been picked. And then as a young adult, I felt
[time=2627] a little abandoned wishing I would have gotten picked over other options He had and that
[time=2635] didn't work out. It was a great truth to come to terms with. But God had picked me. And
[time=2644] that I was on a team, His team, His kingdom team. It was an incredible life-giving truth.
[time=2653] Who picked God picked? Where before the foundations of the world, based on nothing, you and I
[time=2662] ever did or could have done? For what reason? Number three, third thing I want you to see
[time=2668] about God's choosing, the purpose. Oh, and this is big, my friends. Don't miss this.
[time=2673] The purpose, the Scripture teaches us right here in the text, right there in Ephesians 1. It says that the purpose of His choosing, let's just read it together, go back there.
[time=2685] Ephesians 1, it says, verse 4, "Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of
[time=2695] the world that we would be," there it is, "I want everybody to say it out loud, go
[time=2701] holy and blameless." One more time, holy and blameless before Him. See, this is my,
[time=2710] you don't even have, you have no idea how significant that is. We read that and so many
[time=2716] times you and I read that and we think, "Oh, that's what we're going to be." No, it's
[time=2722] not what the text says. What the text says is that when you came to faith in Him, when
[time=2728] He actually called you before the foundations of the world, scratched that, before the foundations of the world, when He chose you in choosing you, He made you in relationship with His
[time=2739] Son, when that time would come, He made you holy and blameless, you not will be, you
[time=2748] are. You are in position before God because of the work of Christ. You are, you, holy,
[time=2762] set apart and righteous and blameless with integrity. You are holy and blameless. This
[time=2771] is your position. I was just thinking about this. I just started to, in the last couple of days, I just started to kind of play this out, stay with me here. I started to think about the first three chapters and how it sets us up for the next three chapters and on this He made you before the foundations of the world, when He chose you holy and blameless.
[time=2792] I went on, I just kind of kept going to two, I went to two, go to two, gosh, go to two
[time=2800] five. Even when we were dead in our transgressions, He made us alive together. Look at six and
[time=2807] raised us up. He's done this. See, this has transpired. You've been raised up with Him,
[time=2814] Ephesians 2, 6. You've been raised up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You were chosen, you were chosen to be because He made you holy
[time=2826] and blameless. He sets you up in the heavenly places with Christ. This is where you sit.
[time=2833] This is your reality. You are in Christ with Him in the heavenlies. 3, 3, 3, 17, 3, 17
[time=2840] says so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted. Look at that. Rooted and grounded in love. You've been chosen to be holy and blameless. You're
[time=2851] set apart into the heavenlies with Christ. You're rooted and grounded in love. All of
[time=2860] that going into your position, allowing you to take your pick. I mean, just start going
[time=2867] through 4, 5, and 6, allowing you to love your wife like Christ loved the church, Ephesians
[time=2876] 5, allowing you to go to Ephesians. Look at Ephesians 5, 3, allowing you because of
[time=2882] your position, because you were chosen to be holy and blameless. You were chosen to
[time=2888] be seated in the heavenlies. You were chosen to be grounded in love and not selfishness,
[time=2895] so 5, 3, but immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you as
[time=2904] is proper among, say it out loud, saints. In some translations it says there shouldn't
[time=2911] even be a hint, not even a hint of immorality. Say, how can I do that? You can't. You can't
[time=2927] do that. Christ did. Christ can. You're in Christ completely transformed, made new, chosen
[time=2936] before the foundations of the world to be holy and blameless, so you get to now by the Spirit of God and the person of Christ you and I get to choose that, to not have
[time=2947] there be a hint, to not have any immorality or impurity even named among us. See, like
[time=2956] high and lofty stuff, that when we read about it we go, oh my goodness, that sounds so right,
[time=2962] I could never, you're right, but your position and what God has done allows you to make choices,
[time=2972] allows you to practice these blessings of our faith. Anybody encouraged by that? Say,
[time=2980] there. I sure am. I sure am. Past blessing number two, not a lot of time here, I'll just
[time=2989] introduce this. Past blessing number one, we were chosen. Past blessing number two, we were adopted. We were adopted. What an amazing thing it is to have the gift, the blessing
[time=3003] that God allows to some to have kids, nothing like it in the world, it's great. What an amazing
[time=3013] spiritual correlation there is to the equally, hear me, the equally special blessing of being
[time=3021] adopted. Anybody in the room adopted? Raise your hands high. Amazing. Anybody in the room
[time=3030] ever adopted someone? Yeah, cool. Thanks. So interesting. Not enough time this morning
[time=3037] to get into it, but it's so amazing to read about it. Again, a friend pointed me in this direction. In those days, you might want to just jot a few of these things down. In those days, the father, you understand this in that culture, the father had complete power. The power was with the man. The power was with the husband, the power was with the father.
[time=3053] All authority rested with the father. Hear the terminology. All authority rested with the
[time=3061] father. The father did all the adopting and the adoption process in that day. The entire process was coordinated by, engaged in by the father and not the mother, not the family, not the grandparents. The father was the one and it was only the father who was involved in the process of adopting a child. All the authority rested with the father. The father was the one who was engaged in the entire process. And when adopted, a child was by the father
[time=3088] and by virtue of the edict, the child was released from any death. The child was released
[time=3094] from any penalty or any previous relationships, family ties or personal connections and given
[time=3101] full, given full air, e-i-r, air status, given full air status with his or her new father.
[time=3115] Ephesians 1-5, he predestined us to what? Say it out loud. Adoption. He preded, he chose
[time=3127] us in him before the foundation of the world and he predestined us to adoption as sons
[time=3136] through Jesus Christ to himself according to what? According to merit, according to what
[time=3144] you were worth, according to how hard? No. According, look at that, to the kind intention
[time=3151] of his will. How amazing was this to these dear people who read this letter in that culture
[time=3161] and how amazing is it to you and me today? Okay, now listen, we're going to keep going
[time=3169] in this passage. Having fun so far? Yeah? I am, but I'm going to tell you this, right?
[time=3174] We're going to stop next week just for a Sunday because I've had enough conversations with people. I've had enough wrestling with this in my own mind and heart been wrestling with
[time=3185] it for years. I don't think I'll ever stop wrestling with it and by no means am I saying in any way, shape or form that next week is going to solve all this for me or you. But
[time=3197] I feel like God's kind of leading me and I think God would want for you and I to just
[time=3203] take some time and think about the implications that are there in this issue of choice. Because
[time=3210] a lot of you were thinking about this, you know, I'm thinking about it. We didn't really get into it. The text itself doesn't demand that we get into it, but the implications,
[time=3221] the implications are so obvious. If he chose us and in his choosing of us, we have been
[time=3231] redeemed and saved. If he chose us and those whom he chooses are his and those who are
[time=3240] his go to heaven. And if you are of the persuasion, if you are of the conviction that probably
[time=3250] not everybody in the world goes to where? Heaven. Then it just goes to reason that then there
[time=3263] were those who didn't get chosen and that if he predetermined, if he predetermined that
[time=3271] I was going to be able to be with him in heaven based on nothing I did, then those who didn't
[time=3279] get chosen end up going to hell based on nothing they did, which is where a lot of us go on
[time=3289] our thinking is what I'm saying. That, my friends, that's dangerous. There are some
[time=3296] things there that I think we need to consider and there are camps, you know, in theological circles. There are camps. There are people who believe certain things. There are Calvinists.
[time=3308] There are those of a Reformed nature who really are very devoted and have a huge conviction
[time=3314] about this doctrine of election and how God chose and some he chose and some he didn't
[time=3320] and the realities of that are hard to wrestle with, but that's the way it is. And then there are others in different camps who believe that God's that the atonement of Christ was for
[time=3331] everybody and some choose it and some don't. Choice is kind of lifted up here. Providence
[time=3337] and sovereignty are lifted up here. And, you know, I just, I keep reading and I keep thinking
[time=3343] and I keep looking at that and you know me, I am not. I feel no obligation to you to explain
[time=3351] God to you. I feel no pressure to make all this make sense. It is confusing after 22
[time=3359] years. I still don't get it, but I feel today more than ever before that I don't have to,
[time=3366] but there's some things I think we should talk about. There's some truth I think we should be made aware of and I'll just give you a little teaser. There is really a third camp, if you will. A third way of looking at this issue that I want to show you next week
[time=3380] that I think has some merit and I think can really encourage us in our further study of this great doctrine of election and salvation. So come back next week and we're going to talk about that and do our best to make our way through it. Would you stand? Let me close this in a word of prayer. Father in heaven, we're grateful for the time we've had together
[time=3399] this morning. We've gathered to encounter you and oh God, we have encountered you in your truth. We have encountered you in our worship. God, we've encountered you in the fellowship that we get to experience here in this room with other brothers and sisters who are doing our best with your help, God, to follow your son. God, thank you for those who have come today that are still considering what it would look like and what it would
[time=3424] be like to fully surrender their hearts and lives to your son. Oh God, I pray that the
[time=3433] blessings of our faith, the truth about what has transpired in salvation, oh, we pray that
[time=3441] it would encourage them toward your son, that it would move them toward faith. Father, we
[time=3447] thank you for the chance to go now. Many of us willing and ready to go and serve this
[time=3453] neighborhood thankful God for the chance to just simply be a blessing to the many, many
[time=3459] people that you've surrounded us with. May we do that. May we go in an effort to enlarge
[time=3466] your reach and God, may you be with us as we do. Thank you for this family, God, and bring us back together again next week, if that be your will, and the opportunity to again gather and be encouraged in your son's name, we pray. Everybody agreed and said amen.
