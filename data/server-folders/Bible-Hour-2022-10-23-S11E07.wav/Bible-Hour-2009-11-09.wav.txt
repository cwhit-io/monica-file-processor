[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] We're so thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=35] As always, it is a joy and a privilege for us to offer you week after week this broadcast.
[time=42] I'm so thankful for our team.
[time=43] I'm so thankful for the Black Hawk family and so many of you who support this Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=49] Week after week, we hear from people.
[time=51] Every single week, those who, like you, maybe, have been affected by, encouraged by, taught by and grown in their faith because of the Bible Hour broadcast and this unique privilege we have to present to you week after week the simple and plain life-changing truth of God's word.
[time=71] So thank you, thanks for your prayers, thank you for your support.
[time=75] I want you to listen closely today.
[time=77] As you listen to the message, I want you to understand something as you take it all in.
[time=82] Many of you are aware of the fact that there are oftentimes controversies or varied opinions when it comes to theological and spiritual issues.
[time=93] Today's message addresses one of those controversies and age-old debates regarding election.
[time=102] God choosing people before the foundation of the world and free will, man's choice given by God to choose or reject.
[time=111] And it's been quite a debate for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years.
[time=115] And in that debate, there have been camps that have been established.
[time=119] Seriously, theological camps and churches and movements that are completely and absolutely based on these two perspectives.
[time=127] And I just want you to know that while we address these things today, and I hope it'll be helpful.
[time=132] I hope it'll be encouraging.
[time=134] At Blackhawk, I want you to know we're not in a camp and we're not about controversies.
[time=138] And while some of God's word is confusing, we feel no compulsion to figure God out.
[time=144] There are things that are just mysterious.
[time=147] And so today as you listen, I hope that maybe some of what is presented will help you understand more clearly some things, but at the end of the day, I hope you'll be like me having thought about it all week long.
[time=160] I hope you'll be like me just blown away by a God whose ways are not our ways, whose thoughts are not our thoughts.
[time=168] And while we love him and we're grateful for him, the thing that we're most, most committed to here at Blackhawk isn't so much a theological perspective, but the gospel.
[time=179] The good news of Jesus Christ, the son of God who came and gave his life so you and I could have life.
[time=186] So sin could be forgiven.
[time=188] So life could be given purpose and meaning.
[time=190] So you and I could have an eternity with God someday in the future.
[time=195] We are about the great truth of the gospel and we are about the great truth of what Jesus has provided.
[time=200] And we want nothing more than to proclaim that and invite you to understand that.
[time=206] And at the end of the day, fully surrender your heart and life to it.
[time=210] Hey, God bless you.
[time=211] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=213] We appreciate it.
[time=214] I hope you'll be encouraged as always come and see us sometime soon on a Sunday morning, nine and 1045.
[time=220] And we'll look forward to seeing you then.
[time=222] Have a great week.

[time=688] [AMEN] (audience applauding) [AMEN] [MUSIC - 206 seconds]
[time=916] (audience applauds) - Hey, if you got your bibles this morning,
[time=926] open them up.
[time=927] We did Ephesians chapter one.
[time=929] Many of you who were here last week know that we've just now started into a study of this great book, this letter from Paul to the church at Ephesus.
[time=938] And as we started in last week and over the last couple of weeks, as we've made our way through these first few verses, we came last week to verse four of chapter one, where it says, "Just as He chose us in Him "before the foundation of the world, "Him choosing us." It's here in this verse and in other places in the New Testament that we are introduced to this great doctrine of election.
[time=966] God choosing people.
[time=969] And we taught on it last week.
[time=971] We talked about His choice of us and when that occurred and why that occurred and how that took place.
[time=977] And it was great truth and I was thankful for our time.
[time=981] As we came away from last week, though I could tell there were questions, there were thoughts, there was a little bit of, you know, scratching of the head as there always is when we talk about or teach about this idea of God choosing.
[time=994] Any time you begin to teach about or talk about God choosing, anytime the doctrine of election comes up, what comes up right behind it is the age-old debate between those who believe in God's sovereign choice and those who want to instead promote the free will of man.
[time=1012] And this morning I thought we would just take some time, as I mentioned to you last week, and just pause for one Sunday in our, kind of our verse by verse study of the book and give some thought to this.
[time=1024] I've decided to come back to not only Ephesians 1, but really the whole of Scripture.
[time=1030] And I want to say this to you, my intent today is not to clear up that debate.
[time=1034] That age-old debate will continue.
[time=1037] And I think in the next 35 minutes you'll understand why.
[time=1040] At the same time, I believe there is always opportunity for us, especially in a room this size with this many people.
[time=1046] There's a great chance for many of you to receive some clarity on things that I think can be clarified.
[time=1052] And I also think it gives us an opportunity to where clarity really isn't possible for you and I to celebrate the great mystery of our God and the privilege we have of serving a God who doesn't always make sense to us, whose ways are not our ways and whose thoughts are not our what, our thoughts.
[time=1072] And so this morning I want to just invite you to kind of consider with me for a moment, initially this debate, if you will.
[time=1080] This will be for some of you new information.
[time=1083] Some of you, as you hear me talk about those who stand in the camp of election and those who stand in the camp of free will, and there's even another camp I'm going to tell you about here this morning, you didn't know there were camps.
[time=1097] And you weren't even aware of the fact that there was debate on these issues.
[time=1100] And for others of you in the room for years and years and years, you've read the books and you've listened to the commentators and you've studied the scriptures and you've heard people stand in places like this and wrestle with this.
[time=1112] And so this morning we're going to do our best to very succinctly give you some things to think about, some things to chew on, some things to hold onto.
[time=1120] But I want to make sure you know up front, my intent is simply to do my best having spent a week of reading and reading and reading and reading and clicking and downloading and pasting and receiving things and looking up stuff.
[time=1139] I tell you it has, I'm grateful in a sense for all that's been said about this topic, but it drives me back to this.
[time=1148] It drives me back to this unbelievable word of God and the great clarity it gives us on this and I believe the great tension that exists in some facets of this conversation and we'll get to that in just a moment.
[time=1165] So here we go.
[time=1166] There are some who believe with respect to salvation and eternal life and God's involvement in all of that.
[time=1174] There are some who believe that through divine and they believe this because of what they see the Bible teaching, they believe that through divine sovereign election before the foundation of the world in eternity past that God chose the individuals who he would save.
[time=1194] Election, God sovereignly choosing the individuals who he would save.
[time=1201] This choice was not based on human merit or what God knew man would choose in the future.
[time=1208] Some believe foreknowledge plays into that and that's how they like to define that and that's not what the folks who stand strong in this area of election believe.
[time=1218] The choice was not based on merit nor on God knowing what man would choose in the future.
[time=1223] It was a choice based solely on God's divine will,
[time=1229] his choice to choose who he would choose.
[time=1233] Now it's interesting, a little scary and a little interesting and there's a lot of tension in this as you start to look into it.
[time=1241] At this point there are some in this election camp if you will who kind of leave it at that.
[time=1250] They believe that God chose people for salvation.
[time=1253] And there are others who go further than that though and want to make a very big deal out of and they want to be very clear with the fact that not only do they believe he chose those who he elected before the foundations of the world for salvation but they believe and they espouse a doctrine of what's called double predestination which means he not only predestined those who would be saved but that God before the foundations of the world predestined and not based on merit but only his own choice those who would go to hell.
[time=1287] That before the foundations of the world all of that was already determined, done deal, signed seal delivered by a divine decree, you're in, you're out and that's it.
[time=1300] And there are some who like I said stop a little shy
[time=1307] of that they believe wholeheartedly in the doctrine of election.
[time=1310] They believe God elected those who would be saved when it comes to those who aren't saved they come at it from a little different angle and we'll get to that different angle in just a moment.
[time=1323] Ephesians 1-4 they would hold on to that some passages in Romans that we'll get to in Peter's writings, God chose those who would be saved in him before the foundation of the world.
[time=1338] Second perspective, some would believe the scriptures teach that God makes salvation available to all through the sacrifice, death and resurrection of his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=1349] This they would call unlimited atonement.
[time=1353] The atoning work of Christ is good for everybody.
[time=1357] The sacrifice of Christ is something that's offered to the entire world and this camp would say that those who choose to repent that those who exercise the choice that they've been given, those who repent and surrender to Christ are saved and those who reject like Adam and Eve, they were given a choice, they rejected.
[time=1383] And those who reject Christ's gift of forgiveness in life are lost and subject to eternal separation in hell.
[time=1392] There are those who stand firmly on this doctrine of divine election.
[time=1404] There's all kinds of passages that are used.
[time=1408] Some seem to me to be a reach.
[time=1412] Some seem to sort of make sense.
[time=1414] Second Peter 3.9 is one that the folks who are in opposition to election will oftentimes refer to the Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness but is patient toward you not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance, putting it out there, knowing all won't come but wishing they would and making it available to everybody.
[time=1440] Election free will.
[time=1445] I mentioned to you last week, there's a third camp.
[time=1447] You could just write this down, corporate election.
[time=1449] That's right, there are some who believe that election is in fact true that God did elect.
[time=1455] God did before the foundations of the world.
[time=1458] Select for himself, in this case not individuals but a people and they'll say that God's always been about a people.
[time=1467] God elected Israel, God elected the angels.
[time=1471] And so they say here not an individual election but a corporate plural election.
[time=1477] God elected the church.
[time=1479] That's who God elected, they say, the church.
[time=1484] And it's the church that at the end of the day will be his.
[time=1489] And it's your choice, then they come back to choice.
[time=1491] It's your choice whether you'll be in Christ, whether you'll be in the church, the body of Christ or not.
[time=1497] But they look at the letter to the Ephesians.
[time=1501] They look at the Paul's writings and they make note of the fact that much of this writing having to do with election was written to peoples, to groups and that what Paul's doing here and what the Scriptures are teaching is a corporate election.
[time=1515] You can look into it.
[time=1516] I think there's some shortcomings there that I would warn you about but I could keep going.
[time=1521] We could go to number four, number five, number six, number seven, number eight, number nine, all kinds of camps and all kinds of thoughts and all kinds of human perspectives and opinions on this.
[time=1534] In these situations, I tend to most of you know me by now,
[time=1540] in these situations, here's what I tend to do.
[time=1543] In situations where I'm not sure or in situations where some things aren't clear, in situations where there's some mystery or tension, I tend to fall back on what I know and what I believe to be clearly true and what I believe to be clearly true and what I believe what I see and what we believe here, the Bible teaches, this morning I think is good for us to come back to.
[time=1568] And I'm not gonna avoid these things but I want you to see these things in the context of what we believe to be true about God and salvation.
[time=1577] You with me?
[time=1578] And so I'm gonna just give you a chance to take notes as we go, as we make our way through this, you'll see where the debate comes into this and at the end I hope you'll have some clarity and hope we can celebrate the mystery and also be grateful for the truth that we do see.
[time=1595] Number one, you can write this down.
[time=1597] Let's just start at the beginning, even though God created man perfectly in the garden prior to Genesis three, even though we were made in the image of God in Genesis three with the onset of sin, man loses that perfection and man becomes inherently sinful.
[time=1613] And I want you to write that down, human beings are naturally, now today, post Genesis three, human beings are naturally sinful.
[time=1623] Romans 323 for how many have sinned?
[time=1626] Say it out loud.
[time=1627] For all have sinned.
[time=1629] Anybody in the room wanna argue with that, raise your hand.
[time=1632] Okay, I didn't think so.
[time=1634] Romans 323 for all have sinned, but it's not just the presence of sin.
[time=1638] What I want you to see here is that we are by virtue of what the scriptures teach, naturally sinful.
[time=1643] What I mean is you while you learn, while you and I both learned progressively how to sin, we were born the scriptures teach, sinful.
[time=1654] We were from the beginning and not just from the first cry, but even inside our mothers, what?
[time=1661] Whom, Psalm 51.5.
[time=1663] You can see it there on the screen, Psalm 51.5.
[time=1667] David says, "Behold, I was brought forth in what?
[time=1670] "In sin, and in sin my mother conceived me." We've talked about this before.
[time=1676] It's not so much referring to the specifics regarding the act that the mother was engaged in.
[time=1682] We know we're talking about the nature of human beings, the nature in this case of the woman and that nature that gets passed along.
[time=1692] Psalm 58.3, you might wanna jot that down.
[time=1695] Psalm 58.3, you'll see it there on the screen.
[time=1699] Psalm 58.3 says, "The wicked are estranged from the womb.
[time=1704] "These who speak lies go astray from what?" And I love that word, astrange.
[time=1711] Look at that word, astrange.
[time=1712] You and I understand that word, astrange.
[time=1714] It's such a great word to use here because it so paints the picture of sin and what sin has done.
[time=1721] Astranged couples, for instance.
[time=1724] Astranged people are what?
[time=1725] Are they together or are they separated?
[time=1728] They're what?
[time=1729] Separated, sin separates us from God.
[time=1733] The wicked are separated from God.
[time=1735] When, from the womb?
[time=1739] We're from the very beginning, sinful.
[time=1744] Because we're humans.
[time=1745] How did this come to be, you ask?
[time=1747] Look at Romans five.
[time=1749] Romans five gives us the answer to this.
[time=1753] It was interesting reading this week.
[time=1755] What some have said about this, and one author that I was reading said, "You know what, you shouldn't be mad, "if you're gonna be mad about something "or if you're gonna really scratch your head on something, "leave election alone and go to Romans five "and shake your head and scratch your head "and wonder how the whole passing along of sin "from Adam to you worked out." But nonetheless, here it is.
[time=1781] Just as clear as day, my friends.
[time=1783] How did we become naturally sinful?
[time=1785] Well, it started back in Genesis three.
[time=1788] Look at Romans five, verse 12.
[time=1790] Therefore, just as through one man, Adam,
[time=1796] sin entered into the world and death through sin and so death spread to all men because all sinned.
[time=1806] All sinned in Adam.
[time=1809] The one man through whom sin entered the world.
[time=1814] Look at verse 16.
[time=1816] Romans five, 16, first part of 16.
[time=1818] The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned.
[time=1822] The gift is not like that which came through Adam.
[time=1825] For on the one hand, the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation.
[time=1834] It was the transgression of Adam that brings about the condemnation on mankind.
[time=1840] It is the seminal, they talk about it in theology, is the seminal passing along of the sin nature.
[time=1846] It's done just by virtue of being a part of his race.
[time=1850] He did it, we got it.
[time=1853] Sin enters in Genesis three and it hasn't left.
[time=1856] Human beings, my friends are naturally sinful.
[time=1861] Number two, the God ordained consequence for our sin.
[time=1865] The God ordained consequence for our sin is physical, spiritual and eternal death.
[time=1871] Physical death, we weren't intended to die.
[time=1874] Sin enters into the picture, now man dies.
[time=1879] Physical death, spiritually.
[time=1880] We were to be in intimacy with God.
[time=1883] We were designed by God to live in perfect union with him.
[time=1886] There was no astrangedness.
[time=1888] There was no separation.
[time=1890] Sin comes in and man is estranged from God.
[time=1894] Spiritually he experiences death and eternally, we were supposed to live with him.
[time=1900] Eternally now in the presence of sin left to ourselves, we spend eternity separated from him.
[time=1907] Romans 623, the God ordained consequence of our sin is death.
[time=1912] Romans 623, many of you know the passage.
[time=1919] Some of you kids in the room could quote it for the wages, wages, what we earn, what we get, what's coming to us.
[time=1927] For the wages of our sin is what?
[time=1930] Death.
[time=1932] But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[time=1937] Stay in Romans and go over to Romans 8.
[time=1940] The God ordained consequence for our sin is physical, spiritual, and eternal death.
[time=1946] Romans 8, 6 says, Romans 8, 6 says,
[time=1953] for the mindset on the flesh is death.
[time=1957] But the mindset on the spirit is life and peace.
[time=1962] Because the mindset on the flesh is hostile toward God, for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so.
[time=1972] And those who are in the flesh, those who are in the sinful flesh,
[time=1978] those who are separated from God cannot even please God.
[time=1984] Drop down to verse 12.
[time=1985] So then brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh, for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die.
[time=2000] I know we haven't gotten there yet, but we will in short time.
[time=2002] Go to Ephesians 2.
[time=2004] We're still in Ephesians 1.
[time=2006] But Ephesians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians.
[time=2012] Go to Ephesians chapter 2, verse 1, where it says, right there.
[time=2016] And you were, Paul, talking about their life prior to knowing Christ, you were dead in your, and your trespasses and sins.
[time=2030] Dead. We've talked about that before.
[time=2032] Dead means dead.
[time=2037] No life.
[time=2039] Nothing.
[time=2040] Flatline.
[time=2043] Zero.
[time=2045] Dead.
[time=2046] Done.
[time=2047] Over.
[time=2050] You were dead.
[time=2053] That's the spiritual condition of the person outside of relationship with Christ.
[time=2058] Dead.
[time=2059] And what caused the death was your trespasses and your sin.
[time=2065] I believe human beings are naturally sinful.
[time=2067] I believe the God ordained consequence for our sin is physical, spiritual, and eternal death.
[time=2073] Thirdly, I believe the only remedy to this dilemma.
[time=2077] The only remedy offered by God for man's sinfulness and its deadly consequence is repentance.
[time=2087] Repentance, the surrendering of one's heart and life to Christ and his ways.
[time=2095] I believe the only remedy God offers for the consequences of sin is repentance and a commitment,
[time=2104] a surrendered heart, to love and follow Jesus Christ.
[time=2111] So many places we could go, go back to the gospels if you would, go to the first one, go to Matthew, go to Matthew chapter 11, it says right there in 1128, again some of you
[time=2122] are familiar with this, for others of you it may be fresh and really good news.
[time=2127] Come to me, Jesus said, come to me, Jesus speaking, come to me, all who are weary and
[time=2133] heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[time=2139] I love what my note says down here at the bottom of my Bible, this is an echo.
[time=2143] Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden, this is an echo of the first beatitude back in chapter 5 verse 3.
[time=2151] Note that this is an open invitation to all who hear, but phrased in such a way that
[time=2157] the only ones who will respond to the invitation are those who are burdened by their sin, weighed
[time=2164] down by their own spiritual bankruptcy and the weight of trying to save themselves by
[time=2171] doing good.
[time=2174] Only remedy, come to me, only remedy Jesus Christ.
[time=2181] Luke 13, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, go over to Luke chapter 13, go to Luke 13, says there
[time=2194] in Luke 13, I tell you no, but unless you repent, I tell you no, but unless you repent,
[time=2203] you will all likewise what, perish, unless you repent.
[time=2210] John 3 16, for God so loved the world, actually go to John, instead of just quoting it, let's
[time=2216] look at it and let's actually look at John, look at John 3 14, let's just look at that
[time=2224] whole thing, it's worth looking at.
[time=2227] John 3 14, 15, as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of
[time=2235] man be lifted up, so that verse 15, so that whoever, what, say it louder, whoever believes
[time=2246] will in him in Christ have what, eternal life.
[time=2252] For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him shall not what, shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[time=2263] The only remedy offered by God for man's sinfulness is repentance, belief in the person
[time=2270] of Christ, faith in the work of Christ.
[time=2274] Look at John 8, go from John 3, go over to John 8.
[time=2279] I love hearing those pages turn, good job, keep looking, it's kind of fun just to dig, my friend Rod Ovett says we're prospecting the Scriptures and that's what we're doing, digging in here, seeing what it actually says, Rod John 8 21, John 8 21, then he said to them,
[time=2296] I go away and you will seek me and will die in your sin where I am going, you cannot come,
[time=2303] so the Jews were saying surely he will not kill himself, will he, since he says where I am going, you cannot come and he was saying to them 23, he was saying to them, you are
[time=2312] from below, I am from above, you are of this world, I am not of this world, therefore I
[time=2318] said to you that you will die in your sins for unless you what, say it, believe, for
[time=2326] unless you believe that I am he the Christ, the Messiah, the Savior, the Redeemer, you
[time=2333] will what, you will die in your sins.
[time=2339] And keep going Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, go to Romans 10, one of my favorite passages of all Scripture, Romans 10, 9 through 13, the only remedy offered by God for man's
[time=2352] sinfulness and its deadly consequence is repentance, the surrendering of one's heart
[time=2358] and life, Romans 10, 9, that if you confess with your mouth, that if you confess with your
[time=2365] mouth, Jesus is Lord, and you believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you
[time=2372] will be what, for with the heart a person believes resulting in righteousness and with
[time=2378] the mouth he confesses resulting in salvation, for the Scripture says whoever believes in
[time=2385] him will not be disappointed, for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on him for whoever will call
[time=2397] on the name of the Lord will be saved. Amen.
[time=2406] I believe that human beings are naturally sinful. Do you? Church, do you? All right.
[time=2416] I believe God ordained that the consequence of sin would be physical, spiritual and eternal
[time=2422] death. Do you believe that? I think the Scriptures teach that. I really do. I believe the only
[time=2428] remedy offered by God for man's sinfulness is repentance. You believe that? All right.
[time=2436] Number four, I believe and I can stand here today with great confidence in my own heart.
[time=2442] This doesn't seem fuzzy to me. This doesn't seem unclear. It seems to me as if the Scriptures
[time=2449] teach this. Number four, the Bible teaches us that salvation is three things, initiated
[time=2456] by God, carried out by God and initiated by God, carried out by God with those whom God
[time=2462] has mercifully chosen. I believe the Bible teaches us that salvation is initiated by God.
[time=2470] Where is it? Hebrews 12 where it says he is the author. Is that where that is? He's
[time=2476] the author and perfecter of our faith. It's always started. Just think about it. Any
[time=2486] interaction between God and man, I mean anything eternal, anything redemptive, it always starts with him. Think about Joseph. Think about David. Think about Abraham. You pick it. Think about the prophets. Did anybody just wake up one day and say, "Hey, I'm going to go talk to God about this whole thing." No, God comes to them. God initiates. God starts. God takes
[time=2507] the first step. 1 John 4 19. We love him because what? He first loved us. The Bible teaches
[time=2518] us that salvation is initiated by God. Hebrews 12, 1 John 4. The Bible teaches us that salvation
[time=2524] is carried out by God. Do you understand this? Go back to the Gospels again. Go back to the
[time=2530] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. Go to John 6. John 644. John 644 here talking about how salvation
[time=2544] is carried out by God. John 644 says, "No one can come to me, hear Jesus himself speaking.
[time=2553] No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me," what? Draws him. God is the author.
[time=2562] God is the initiator. Nobody comes to Jesus. Nobody comes to faith unless God is drawing
[time=2570] him. I believe this is true. Look at John 644 now, go to 65. John 665 and he was saying,
[time=2580] "For this reason I have said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted
[time=2586] him from who? From the Father." I believe the Bible teaches us that salvation is initiated
[time=2593] by God. It's carried out by God with those whom God has mercifully chosen. Look at Romans
[time=2600] 9. You go to Romans 9, 14 through 16. Romans 9, 14 through 16. What shall we say then? There
[time=2609] is no injustice with God. Is there? Why is Paul saying this? Well, he's in the midst
[time=2615] of a discussion, a teaching, writing about election. What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God. Is there? May it never be. For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy
[time=2626] on whom I have mercy and I God and He's God and He can do this. And He has the authority
[time=2634] and He has the power and He has the discernment. I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and
[time=2640] I will have compassion on whom I have compassion." So then it does not depend on the man who
[time=2647] wills or the man who runs, but on God who has what? Mercy. But on God who has mercy,
[time=2656] Ephesians 1-4, before the foundations of the world, we were chosen in Him, 2 Thessalonians.
[time=2663] Go back past 1 Timothy or before 1 and 2 Timothy, you'll come to 1 and 2 Thessalonians and
[time=2672] you see there in 2 Thessalonians 2, 13. But we should, Paul saying here to the church
[time=2678] at Thessalonica, but we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren, beloved by
[time=2684] the Lord because God has chosen you from the beginning, before the foundations of the world,
[time=2691] for salvation, through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.
[time=2699] I want to make sure I'm really clear here. I believe with every ounce of my being that
[time=2705] salvation is from God. I believe that God initiates it. I believe that God carries it
[time=2712] out. I believe He carries it out with those He's mercifully chosen. I think it's made possible by God. I think it's accomplished fully and completely by God. I think it's
[time=2723] fully secured by God. It's offered only by God. I believe that to be true. I think the
[time=2729] Scriptures are absolutely clear on that. Do you see some things there that we've read
[time=2735] that would lead you to believe that's pretty clear? Yes or no? Okay, number five. And this
[time=2744] is where this is where some would say, and it's okay. I'm a big boy and I'm in recovery
[time=2750] so I don't care what you think of me. How's that? Little joke for us and the family here.
[time=2759] This is where some will say I'm backing up and this is where some will say I'm chickening out and this is where some will say I'm really not truly engaged in the full scope of the
[time=2770] doctrine of election. Say what you will. I believe that the Bible, and it's always interesting
[time=2780] to me when you talk to somebody about election or you talk to somebody about free will, they always say hey listen it's in the Bible and I always say I know. They both are. I mean
[time=2792] it's right here. I believe the Bible also teaches. Now listen that God sovereignly allows man
[time=2798] to participate. Try to use my words carefully here. I believe that God sovereignly allows
[time=2806] man to participate in the redemptive transaction. Man has nothing to do with salvation and it
[time=2820] being complete and it being made available and it being good and it being thorough. Are you with me? Man has nothing to do. God made it possible not man. God delivers it not you.
[time=2834] God's the one who secures it. God's the one who pursues. Are you with me? You and I have
[time=2841] absolutely nothing to do with those foundational elements of this great gift called salvation.
[time=2848] He did it. Amen? And then he comes after you like he came after me and he begins to draw
[time=2857] you to himself and he allows you and I I believe in that process to participate in the redemptive
[time=2865] transaction. Again I'll take you back to some of what we already saw. John 3 16 he calls
[time=2871] for you and I to believe. He calls for you and I to make a decision. To choose belief
[time=2879] over disbelief. Look at John. A friend pointed out some of these to me. It was very helpful
[time=2885] John 5. Matthew Mark Luke John go back to John. Go to John 5. I want to just take you
[time=2891] through a few of these. John 5 24. John 5 24 truly truly I say to you. Are you there?
[time=2901] John 5 24 truly truly I say to you he who hears my word and believes him who sent me
[time=2908] has eternal life and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life. How
[time=2916] when that person believes when that person surrenders. God allowing us to participate
[time=2924] in the redemptive transaction. Go over to 647. We were just in 644 talking about how
[time=2930] God is at work here drawing people now in that very same context. Go to 647 because
[time=2938] in 647 after 644. 644 said no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws
[time=2948] him and 647 says truly truly I say to you he who believes has eternal life. The two what
[time=2960] working in contrast to each other or is it the two mysteriously working together. Go to
[time=2966] Acts 2. Go to Acts 2 21. Acts 2 21 here in the midst of Peter's sermon and it shall be
[time=2976] Acts 2 21. The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood verse 20 before the
[time=2983] great and glorious day of the Lord shall come and it shall be verse 21 that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. Everyone who believes everyone who makes that
[time=2997] decision to fall literally or figuratively on their face to bow the knee of their soul
[time=3003] to call on the name of the Lord will be saved. Acts 10. They'll just a few pages over to
[time=3011] Acts 10. 43 of him of him all the prophets bear witness Acts 10. 43 of him all the prophets
[time=3024] bear witness that through his who's him Jesus of him all the prophets bear witness that
[time=3030] through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sin everyone who believes
[time=3039] in him. Look at 16. Acts 16 27. Acts 16 27. Interesting thing here the earthquake comes
[time=3052] and Paul's freed from the jail. The jail are realizing his life's on the line because the prisoners escaped panics when the jailer awoke and saw the prison. When the jailer
[time=3063] awoke and saw the prison doors opened he drew his sword and was about to kill himself supposing that the prisoners that escaped but Paul cried out with a loud voice saying don't harm yourself we're here and he called for lights and rushed in and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas and after he brought them out he said sirs what must I do to be saved and
[time=3081] they said believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be what and you will be saved. I'm not
[time=3094] I'm very careful to not make subjective experience in any way trump you know truth I'm not saying
[time=3101] that but I just I want to invite you to think about yours but I want to just tell you about mine I just want you to know that in the back of that room and that church I've told you before 1983 September back row right side Dr. MacArthur teaching from Romans 7 O wretched
[time=3118] man that I am who will save me from this body of death. I just want to I just think back on that and I remember the months leading up to that I remember God was at work make no
[time=3129] mistake I was reading books I used to throw away I was listening to tapes I couldn't care less about in years gone by I couldn't get enough and he's drawing me and I'm engaging
[time=3141] in that and I'm asking questions and I'm having conversations and I can't believe the things I'm saying and on that night the spirit of God moved in me and I bow the knee of my heart
[time=3152] and I submitted myself to him and I cried out to him with tears dropping off my cheeks
[time=3158] onto my shoes I can see it today and I believe in that God gave me the way I like to say
[time=3168] it is he allows us to keep our spiritual dignity in this transaction does that make sense he
[time=3176] saved me he saved me I didn't bring something to the table and by virtue of my repentance
[time=3184] or my confession I didn't play some final key role and nor did you but he allows you
[time=3191] and I to participate and for that I'm thankful you know what's amazing to me we got to go
[time=3199] let me say this to you all week long as I looked at this it struck me and I talked with
[time=3205] a friend about it all week long as I read this listen all week long as I read this I read
[time=3214] I read stacks I read stacks of papers about this whole thing enormous controversy unbelievable
[time=3222] this unity all week long as I read this it dawned on me Paul and Peter they wrote a lot
[time=3231] about this they actually both wrote a lot about it from both sides and never wants do
[time=3240] you ever get the sense that they're confused think about that they weren't confused they
[time=3250] knew something they'd seen someone they'd lived with in Peter's case there was a clarity
[time=3260] that they had that years and years and years and years and reams and reams and reams of commentaries have left you and I confused they weren't and I do want to say this and
[time=3271] I hate to sound like I'm flip flocking back and forth but I need to say this to you be careful with this because a lot of times what you and I do with this is we read about these
[time=3282] doctrines and we hear the truth about it and to us listen it doesn't seem especially this
[time=3289] idea of a god who chooses it doesn't seem fair and I read one guy this week who talked
[time=3298] about the human preoccupation with fairness where does this come from here he wrote we
[time=3305] serve a god who is just listen he's just and justice sinfulness demands that justice
[time=3316] be brought and man is what just leave it at that for now and and in this quest for fairness
[time=3332] all of a sudden we just start rearranging things because we can't imagine I can't tell you how many times I heard that this week I can't imagine well you know what this isn't about what you and I can imagine this is about what this says and I believe what this says
[time=3347] is really really clear and I believe it doesn't answer all of our questions and I do know this
[time=3354] I have no idea I have no idea what God has orchestrated before the foundations of the world so I'm going to proclaim the truth to everybody and we're going to live out the truth to everybody and we're going to serve people and we're going to love people and we're going to proclaim the scriptures and we're going to let God do his divine work and we're going to celebrate what he does and if you're here today and your soul is stirred and you know he's been calling leave the debate behind for goodness sake and respond
[time=3385] to the gift of God and let's leave this place today having enjoyed the chance to think about
[time=3391] it let's go home and love our wives let's go home and love our husbands let's go home and love our families let's go home and be good employees let's go home and be faithful to our friends you get what I'm saying there's some things that we're confused about there's some things that are really really clear so let's go and do those things that are really really clear why don't you stand let me pray for us and we'll go father God thank you for this family God thank you for the hundreds of people who raped leaves last week they
[time=3419] brought their kids and they they got what their friends and they were a blessing to so many in this neighborhood and God I pray that because of our love for you and our gratitude for you that we would be a gracious people willing to give ourselves away priests who are willing to go and pass you along to others God thank you for the great truth that we've been able to look at this morning thank you for the confidence that it brings and where it brings question and where it brings confusion father I pray that we could celebrate a God who can't be
[time=3449] figured out but a God who we know loves us deeply we've experienced that we've seen that
[time=3455] the scriptures bear witness to that so God be with us as we go allow us to be a people
[time=3461] who proclaim who proclaim the gospel who live out the great truth of salvation who model
[time=3469] for an on looking world as we talked about last week distinct and unique living and God
[time=3476] may we do that with great strength in your son's name we pray and everybody agreed and said amen.
