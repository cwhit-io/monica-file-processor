[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] I'm so thankful that you're here and I'm thankful today to be joined by Corbin Miller, our worship pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=41] And Corbin and I, first of all, welcome.
[time=42] - Thanks.
[time=43] - Good to have you here.
[time=44] We wanna talk to you about what's coming up in December.
[time=47] And what's coming up in December is something that has always been so very special to the Blackhawk family and this community.
[time=54] We call it Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=56] And for years and years, Blackhawk has taken a given weekend or weekends and celebrated through the arts song and drama and kids and dance and the whole nine yards with four, five, six different concerts in a weekend.
[time=72] Well, Corbin and the team have decided this year and I think it's a great idea to spread that celebration out over the entire month.
[time=80] And so on all the successive Sunday mornings and Christmas Eve here at Blackhawk this year, we'll be celebrating Christmas with Blackhawk and experiencing this greatest of all stories ever told.
[time=93] So Corbin, tell 'em, just give 'em a little overview of the sixth, which is as they watch this next Sunday, the sixth, the 13th and the 20th.
[time=102] - Yeah, on the sixth, we're really excited to do something kind of a lot different for Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=108] Usually the kids would sing a song.
[time=110] This year we've got 'em singing 10 songs and acting and dancing in their own production called Meet Me at the Major.
[time=116] Kelly, we actually had 73 sign up for the kids choir.
[time=120] - Wow.
[time=121] - And two birds, two of mine.
[time=122] - Two birds.
[time=123] - In the 73.
[time=124] - 71 others.
[time=125] And Janice Marisi, our children's ministry director and I have been co-leading that and it's been challenging and fun this last month as we're preparing.
[time=133] And we can't wait for you to come next week and check out the kids doing Meet Me at the Major.
[time=137] We try to every week to try to make the events a little bit unique, but at the same time poignant and meaningful and Christmassy and spiritual.
[time=146] And so the kids are gonna do that on the sixth and then the following week.
[time=150] - Hang on, that's a non-ticketed event.
[time=153] - That's right.
[time=154] - And it's our normal worship service times.
[time=156] Nine and 1045, you can come and check it out, both ours and all of them are non-ticketed.
[time=161] - Everything's non-ticketed the whole month.
[time=163] - Now the next week, our drama team is working on something called Christmas Rewind, which is basically just an entertaining, fast-paced, energetic, poignant, but at the same time, hilarious look at the whole Christmas story from both Matthew chapter one and Luke chapter two, they kind of have all the info packed into about a 20-minute production.
[time=186] And they're just doing an incredible job getting that together.
[time=189] And that's also a Sunday that you're teaching to kind of round out the rest of the time and you're teaching at all of these, right?
[time=196] - Yeah, each Sunday I get a chance to follow up with what Corbin's talking about with a message that day and I can't wait to take part in what's going on dramatically and musically and artistically.
[time=208] I can't wait to follow that up with a message each week along these great themes.
[time=213] - Yeah, and then the third Sunday in December would be December 20th and we've got our choir and orchestra just working their tails off to get ready for about a 45-minute worship concert experience.
[time=225] - Good.
[time=226] - A really big Sunday.
[time=227] They always do a phenomenal job every week and they've been working extra hard these last couple of months to get ready for the 20th.
[time=233] Just a lot of songs that you know and love at Christmas time but some cool arrangements and we're just looking forward to seeing that happen.
[time=241] We also have some dancers that'll be dancing, worshiping through song and through scripture and through prayer and I think it's just gonna be a good Sunday.
[time=249] - So I hope you caught all that, kids on the sixth, an incredible drama on the 13th and then a musical celebration on the 20th and we want you to come and be a part of all of that.
[time=261] Corbin and I would also love to invite you, you and your family, you and your friends to come and join us on Christmas Eve this year.
[time=267] At 6 p.m. on December 24th, we're gonna have the privilege of seeing our team do a musical drama that Corbin wrote four or five years ago called "The Story of Christmas." And if you've been around CWB, Christmas with Black Hawk the last few years, you've seen "The Story of Christmas." It is a powerful and extremely well done drama that depicts from the eyes of Mary, the story of Jesus and his life and his sacrifice.
[time=295] And it's something you don't want to miss.
[time=297] We'll also have communion that night, correct?
[time=300] Communion and then some singing as well.
[time=302] It'll be a phenomenal hour or so and we can't wait to have you come and be with us Christmas Eve.
[time=307] So thank you for all your hard work.
[time=310] The team has been faithful and diligent these last several weeks in preparing for December and what a December it's gonna be.
[time=318] Come and be with us as we celebrate Christmas with Black Hawk.
[time=322] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 63 seconds]
[time=393] Sing H2H.
[time=396] [MUSIC - 51 seconds]
[time=452] - All my time, okay.
[time=455] [MUSIC - 180 seconds]
[time=636] One more time, Church, let your voice name above all names.
[time=641] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=666] Well, hey, back to our discussion.
[time=667] Open your Bibles to Ephesians chapter one.
[time=670] Back to our newly started study.
[time=672] We've entitled it "The Truth, the Way, the Life," a study of the Book of Ephesians.
[time=678] If you were here a few weeks ago, you know that that series title is very important for us.
[time=683] We see in the first three chapters of the Book of Ephesians, Paul lays out for us the truth about our salvation.
[time=690] That's right.
[time=691] What has transpired?
[time=692] What God has done?
[time=694] And what he has done?
[time=695] What that means to you and I today?
[time=697] Our position made possible by what his son accomplished on the cross.
[time=702] Everything about salvation and all that comes with it, the truth about our salvation, our place in the family of God.
[time=711] The next three chapters four, five, and six shows us the way, the way you and I are to live in light of that truth.
[time=719] The way we practice our position.
[time=722] I'm having a blast in these first three chapters.
[time=725] I can't wait to get to four, five, and six though.
[time=728] We are going to have a phenomenal time looking practically at the way you and I are to live our lives based on the truth about our salvation.
[time=737] My friends, the truth about what he did, from the way you and I are to live out that truth leads us to, and it's the only thing that leads us to the life.
[time=749] The life God intended you and I to live.
[time=754] A lot of promises out there.
[time=756] A lot of slogans, a lot of marketing campaigns, trying to lead you and I to real living.
[time=762] There's only one real living.
[time=764] There's only one life.
[time=766] God designed it and he wants you and I to live it, and we do when we understand the truth about what he did in the way in which we are to live.
[time=774] All of that made possible in Christ who said, "I am the way, the truth, and the what, and the life."
[time=786] So back to our discussion.
[time=787] If you're joining us this morning for the first time, welcome.
[time=790] You haven't, well, you haven't missed a lot, but we're not that far into it.
[time=794] Just a couple of weeks, so I'd encourage you to listen online or watch online or pick up a DVD or CD.
[time=800] You can do that through the website or here at our church office, but we come this morning back to our discussion in Ephesians 1, regarding the fact that God's Word teaches us here in verses 3 to 14.
[time=812] Ephesians 1, 3 to 14, it teaches us that we have been in Christ.
[time=816] In relationship with Christ, this passage tells us we have been blessed.
[time=823] That we have been blessed.
[time=824] What does that mean?
[time=825] We have been given favor.
[time=827] We have been the recipients of divine gifts.
[time=829] We have been provided for.
[time=832] We have been given everything, underline that.
[time=835] Circle that phrase.
[time=836] We have been given everything.
[time=838] We could ever need in the spiritual realm by God when we are in Christ.
[time=844] Ephesians 1, 3 to 14.
[time=846] Two weeks ago, we broke this passage down into three sections and we entitled it God's blessings to those in Christ.
[time=854] And we'll pick that up again this morning.
[time=856] You ready? God's blessings to those in Christ.
[time=860] Number one, we've been and we talked about this over the last two Sundays.
[time=864] We won't go into it any further today except just to touch on one of these things.
[time=869] We've been chosen, predestined and adopted by God verses 3 through 6.
[time=876] God's blessings to those in Christ began with a look back to the past and the activity of God.
[time=883] And we saw there that we have been chosen, predestined and adopted by God.
[time=889] Look with me at the text.
[time=890] Blessed be the God in Father verse 3 of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.
[time=900] Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.
[time=909] In love He predestined us to adoption.
[time=913] Adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself according to what?
[time=919] According to what you deserved, according to what you merited, according to what you had coming know, according to the kind intention of His will.
[time=928] To the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in Him in the beloved.
[time=940] God's blessings to those in Christ.
[time=943] We have been chosen by God, predestined and adopted.
[time=947] We've been redeemed and forgiven by Christ.
[time=949] We'll look at that in just a moment.
[time=952] We have been sealed in Christ by the Holy Spirit verses 13 and 14.
[time=958] Now before we jump in to those three amazing points, I want to just give you a little bit of backdrop into what it is that you're actually reading
[time=968] when you look at verses 3 through 14.
[time=971] You and I look at it and to us it just looks like a couple of paragraphs.
[time=975] It's actually the longest sentence.
[time=978] It's all one sentence.
[time=980] In the Greek there would be no break.
[time=982] It is one long, profound, proclaiming, exaltive sentence that Paul just two verses in.
[time=990] But literally if you were to read this back in the day, if you were there in Ephesus reading this, what you would know by virtue of the way it was constructed is that it was a song.
[time=1001] We're just saying several.
[time=1003] This 3 to 14 is a hymn.
[time=1006] It's a lyrical benediction.
[time=1010] The benedictions began with the phrase blessed, and these songs or benedictions declared that which was good and right and true, and they did so with great emphasis.
[time=1019] Blessed means to make much of, to praise, to elevate and commend.
[time=1024] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1028] This emphatic declaration would be done with great energy, with great heart and soul, and it would all be about, in this case, this song, this hymn, all about the blessings of God.
[time=1040] The blessings of God.
[time=1043] Number one, we've been chosen, predestined, and adopted by God, and write this in there in the past.
[time=1049] Here we see divine activity in days gone by.
[time=1054] Now last week, actually the last two weeks, we talked a lot about this choosing, this doctrine of election.
[time=1061] And if you missed it, please pick up the CD or again listen online.
[time=1065] I don't want to get back into that, but I do want to touch on the third thing you see there in your notes.
[time=1070] We've been chosen, predestined, and adopted.
[time=1075] We said a few things about this a couple weeks ago.
[time=1077] Let me come back to this great principle, this great truth of adoption.
[time=1083] Look at what it says there in verse five.
[time=1085] He predestined us, you see it? He predestined us to adoption as what?
[time=1092] Say it, sons, as sons, under Roman law, listen.
[time=1096] Under Roman law, a child was without rights completely and absolutely, with no doubt, there were no rights of any kind given to a child under the age of 18.
[time=1112] They were property, that was it.
[time=1116] Weren't even really seen as valuable or human, they were goods to be cared for, traded, it was amazing.
[time=1123] And so adoption, adoption was a huge and significant commitment and obviously had serious implications.
[time=1132] The ritual of adoption was rather impressive and symbolic.
[time=1136] And let me just explain this to you, it would be different than you and I adopting someone today.
[time=1141] The process that you and I would go through today, if we were going to adopt a little girl or a little boy, would entail paperwork and it would entail some legal back and forth.
[time=1152] And there would be some stuff that we would look up online and then we'd go to places and it's a very complex, usually in today's world, very arduous process.
[time=1161] Sometimes it takes months.
[time=1163] What would happen in this day, though, if we're talking about adoption and here God is talking about adoption, he chose to divinely use that word.
[time=1173] And he places that word into a culture where when they heard this word, it would mean to them something very clear.
[time=1180] See, adoption was a symbolic ritual.
[time=1183] It was like a drama, really.
[time=1186] When a kid got adopted, there would be this little play carried out right there in front of the magistrate.
[time=1194] And it was interesting to read about it this week.
[time=1197] The play would begin, this symbolic ritual would begin with the biological father if he was there, usually he wasn't.
[time=1208] So they'd have somebody stand in in the biological father's place.
[time=1214] The biological father or the one playing the part of the biological father would sell the son, the child, the boy, the girl.
[time=1221] They'd sell him and two times they would symbolically buy him or her back.
[time=1226] The third time they would sell him or her and they would not buy him back.
[time=1232] But rather, the adoptive father would then take center stage, literally walk right out there to the front in front of the judge and would pay the money that was due and begin to plead his case to the local magistrate for the privilege of adopting this little boy or girl.
[time=1254] All of this drama is played out, the adoption would be made by the power of the magistrate.
[time=1263] Two great words, the adoption would be made complete and irrevocable, irrevocable.
[time=1272] So come back into our discussion later in the passage, but I just want you to hang on to that.
[time=1277] Nothing, nothing could undo it. No set of circumstances, no powers outside.
[time=1284] There would be absolutely nothing that could ever take that child away from the reality that he or she was a child of that man and that woman.
[time=1297] It's pretty powerful, complete and irrevocable. The child now had all the rights of a legitimate son or daughter in his new family.
[time=1306] In the eyes of the law in that day, if you set adoption, they fought all of that and what they knew was that that little boy or that little girl was now a new person.
[time=1319] Sound familiar? He was considered so new that all debts and obligations connected with his past, previous family and associations were gone just as if they never existed.
[time=1333] This is what Paul says. You and I read adoption. When they see adoption, this is what Paul is saying God has done for them. Imagine the good news of this message to those who heard it.
[time=1344] Here was a God. The only true God in love willing to lovingly adopt this and wipe the past slate clean and forever consider us an heir to the heavenly realm. Sometimes I say in a room like this, hey, who's been adopted?
[time=1357] And a few hands will go up and most of us look at those hands and think, gosh, I don't really know what that would be like. That's so interesting and we're so excited because we kind of sort of understand the implications of that, but we look at that and go, huh?
[time=1371] Well, now I hope none of us in this room would ever look at that and go, huh? I hope everybody in the room understands that if you know the Lord, if you've fully surrendered your heart and life to him, you've been what? Say it.
[time=1383] Adopt it. We've all been adopted. Full rights, full privileges, past slate gone, irrevocable, complete. Amen? Amen.
[time=1394] That's the first batch of blessings. But God in the past chose, predestined and adopted you. What a blessing. What a blessing. Number two, let's keep going.
[time=1407] We've been redeemed and forgiven by Christ in the present. God's activity in the past. Now we come to the Lord Jesus Christ and His activity in the present, if you will, for us.
[time=1419] Verses 7 and 8, redeemed and forgiven. Read with me. Look what it says. It says there in 1, 7, "In Him, in Christ, we have redemption." Love that word.
[time=1431] Through His blood, we're saying about that blood. I'm so thankful that Adam and the team led us and worshiped this morning and incorporated so much of this into what we're saying.
[time=1441] We have redemption through His blood. The forgiveness of our trespasses. According to what? According to the riches of His grace, which He, verse 8, which He lavished on us. Wow.
[time=1457] Which He lavished on us. We'll come back to that. To redeem. What's it mean? Well, you can just take your pen and write this in. To redeem means to ransom.
[time=1467] To redeem, it's such a powerful picture, my friends. To redeem means to ransom. This word was used originally for buying back a slave or captive. In the buying back, you would make them free by the payment of a price.
[time=1484] The term was used in reference to prisoners of war, slaves and criminals condemned to death. It's a powerful word because not only does it describe the activity of one who steps in for the benefit of another, but the one who gets benefited is one who was looking at and facing
[time=1502] and there was no way around it, they were gonna what? They were gonna die.
[time=1509] It was also used in translating the Old Testament when it spoke of Israel's deliverance from the bondage of Egypt. In every case, and this is worth noting, in every case, this concept is used to describe delivering a person from a situation which they could have never been able to rescue themselves from.
[time=1534] Who in this room with me remembers that? Who in this room remembers that being rescued from that situation and from that life and from that reality that when it came right down to it, there was just no way.
[time=1554] We were ever gonna rescue ourselves, I wrote this down earlier this week, if you're here this morning, trying to fight through the bondage and chains of your sin.
[time=1566] Anybody here this morning? Trying your best with your strength? Anybody here? Anybody watching on the broadcast?
[time=1577] Doing everything you can, everything you can muster up on your own, anybody here trying to somehow break through the bondage, the chains of your sin and your disobedience?
[time=1589] I wanna just tell you this and I wanna say it lovingly, but I wanna say it to you, it's futile, it'll never happen, you'll never break free, you'll never ever get through it on your own.
[time=1603] You're not strong enough, you're not wise enough, you're not smart enough, you're not determined enough, your sin, just like mine.
[time=1612] Mine would have kept me captive were it not for the redeeming love of God, who came and saved and rescued me from a situation I could have never saved myself from.
[time=1628] The Roman statesman Seneca said it like this, he said men hate their sin but could not leave it.
[time=1636] They were despairingly conscious of their weakness in necessary things, they loved their vices and hate them at the same time.
[time=1645] What men need Seneca said is I hand let down to lift them up. Wow, the highest thinkers of the day knew that they desperately needed to be rescued from the darkness of what we call sin and they felt helpless in that plight.
[time=1663] It was that very liberation, it was that very redemption my friends that Paul writes about here in our passage this morning that Jesus came to bring, that very redemption that Jesus came to bring to an imprisoned mankind.
[time=1680] Look with me back, let me just try and do this quickly, look back in your Old Testament, go back to Hosea, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, if you get over there to Joel and Amos you've gone a little too far.
[time=1694] Look at Hosea chapter 3 and as you're turning to Hosea 3, let me just paint this picture for you, most of you know this, some of you may not, but listen, Hosea is this guy that God comes to and God wants to with this great analogy, with this great illustration,
[time=1708] God wants to illustrate his faithful love to a very unfaithful people, the nation of who? Israel.
[time=1715] So here's how God, yeah, you hate to be in Hosea's shoes in a sense, but here's how God chooses to illustrate this. He comes to Hosea and says, Hosea, I want you to marry Gomer was her name, and Gomer was a prostitute.
[time=1731] And he says, I want you to go and I want you to marry a prostitute. And the bad news is, the good news is there's none, the bad news is she's going to keep being a prostitute.
[time=1744] And so she kept being a prostitute, and she was unfaithful to her husband, Hosea, and she wasn't unfaithful once, she was unfaithful a bunch, and she kept having kids by these other men, and Hosea kept trying to love her and kept taking her back.
[time=1761] And finally they just kind of crumble and they fall apart and it's not so good, and she's off and now she's just doing her thing, and we come to chapter 3.
[time=1771] And you've never seen, in light of that backdrop, oh, you've never seen such a powerful picture as this, then the Lord said to me, wow.
[time=1780] Imagine, now imagine your Hosea, then the Lord said to me, go again, go again, how many times had he gone?
[time=1787] Go again, love a woman who was loved by her husband yet an adulterous, even as the Lord loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods that you and me,
[time=1800] and love raising cakes, so I listened to this, so Hosea, so I bought her, what word is that my friends?
[time=1809] It's redemption.
[time=1811] So I bought her, look what it says in verse 2, so I bought her for myself for 15 shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley, then I said to her, you, my wife, you shall stay with me for many days.
[time=1829] Now when it says he bought her, that opens up a very clear picture, this is not speculation.
[time=1835] If he says he bought her, the picture there that God's painting is that she had kind of run her course as a prostitute.
[time=1844] And when women had been prostitutes for a long, long time, when those who wanted prostitutes were done with those women who had done it for so long, and they had done it for so long, now they were done, if you get what I mean.
[time=1858] They'd just sell them.
[time=1861] They'd just take them to an auction, in their chains and their shackles, without any clothes on, put them up on a block and they'd just sell them like cattle.
[time=1872] And there's her husband in the back going, I got her.
[time=1878] I'm buying her back.
[time=1881] Did she deserve it? Answer? No. Did she merit it? Answer? No.
[time=1888] Humanly speaking, should he have done that? No.
[time=1892] Thank God.
[time=1894] Thank God he didn't redeem you and me based on what we deserved, Amen.
[time=1898] Thank God that through his son Jesus Christ, you and I have been redeemed.
[time=1904] What a powerful picture. Back to Ephesians 1.
[time=1907] Back to Ephesians 1, it says, go back to, go back to 7 and 8.
[time=1913] It says in him, it says there in verse 7, it says in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses.
[time=1927] And you know what, this is just, this is just on the side here. I'm going to just take a minute.
[time=1932] Is it applicable to our message today? Absolutely.
[time=1936] It's right here in the train of God in the past, chosen, predestined, adopted, Christ in the present.
[time=1942] He redeems and forgives us. But I want you to see that word there.
[time=1946] It just struck me this week. Sometimes I'm reading through this word of ours, my friends.
[time=1952] And sometimes things just strike me. I've read that verse thousands and thousands of times.
[time=1956] And I'm reading it this week and all of a sudden that word just popped off the page, trespass.
[time=1962] And I just thought, well, if I'm supposed to say something, I'll say it.
[time=1965] And the more I thought about it, he just gave me this to say to you, so I'm going to say it.
[time=1969] I was just thinking about this word, trespasses.
[time=1975] It's, it's opening, think about it. It's opening a gate.
[time=1983] It's climbing over a fence. It's stepping over a line.
[time=1991] It's trying to get in someplace where you're what? Not supposed to be, right?
[time=1999] Oftentimes, listen, in order to get somewhere quicker or easier.
[time=2008] And I don't know where your minds are right now. You may be in that, in that field that you played in as a kid.
[time=2013] You may be in the middle of some college prank, like I kind of am right now, in my mind.
[time=2018] I don't know where your mind goes when you think about trespassing.
[time=2023] But we open gates and we hop fences and we go over lines and we're trying to get somewhere usually quicker or easier.
[time=2030] And the fact is, the more I thought about it, I realized, you know what? God oftentimes, not all the time.
[time=2035] God oftentimes wants me to end up at the same place.
[time=2039] It's just that oftentimes God doesn't want me to get there quicker or easier.
[time=2044] Sometimes God wants me to be patient, wait, be sacrificial, go through hard things. You with me?
[time=2051] Here's my encouragement to you. I just, I try my best to listen to him and here's what I sense him saying,
[time=2057] to just remind all of you in the room, to obey the signs.
[time=2064] Be mindful of the sign. There's a reason it's there. Don't trespass.
[time=2071] Stay away from the line. Get off the fence. Don't go in.
[time=2081] Don't trespass. And aren't you grateful?
[time=2088] Aren't you grateful, I know I am, for those times that we have and those times that we may still, aren't you thankful?
[time=2096] That through the sacrificial, redeeming work of Christ, we've been forgiven.
[time=2102] We've been redeemed by Christ in the present.
[time=2107] We've been blessed, my friends. We've been blessed, chosen by God, redeemed by the Lord thirdly.
[time=2113] We've been sealed. Write this down. We've been sealed in Christ by the spirit of God.
[time=2121] And we've been sealed by Christ in the spirit of God for the future.
[time=2127] God's activity in the past, the work of our Lord Jesus Christ in the present for us, and in the future we see the spirit of God.
[time=2134] The Scriptures say our text to this morning, sealing us in Christ for the future. Look with me at verses 13 and 14.
[time=2143] Ephesians chapter 1, it says in 13, "In Him, you also, after listening to the message of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, having also believed there's that activity."
[time=2156] We get to be a part of, we talked about it last week, having also believed at that point you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of Promise, the Holy Spirit of Promise.
[time=2168] What's that about? Who is they? Who is given as a pledge, the Spirit of God, given to you in Christ as a pledge of our inheritance?
[time=2179] With all we've got coming to us, eternal life with God, an inheritance with a view to the redemption of God's own possession to the praise of His glory.
[time=2193] Three quick things here about the Holy Spirit, one just a general truth, two very related to the passage to the two verses we just read.
[time=2201] Number one, keep this in mind as it relates to the Holy Spirit. At conversion, the Bible teaches, at conversion, the Bible teaches that we are indwelt by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2213] Did you know this? Some of you do, others of you maybe didn't. At the point where you come to faith in Christ, the Scriptures are abundantly clear.
[time=2221] We'll look at one verse here in just a moment, that when you come to faith in Christ, God divinely and miraculously and graciously instills in you, the Spirit of God indwels you.
[time=2234] The Scriptures teach, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, sometimes it's referred to at the point of salvation, at the point of conversion, if you will, the Spirit of God.
[time=2244] Listen, not half of the Spirit, not three-fourths of the Spirit, but all of the Spirit indwels the believer.
[time=2252] Is that clear? At conversion. In sanctification, what does that mean? Sanctification, the ongoing, every day to day of life that you and I live in relationship with God as He grows us.
[time=2264] In the process of sanctification, there are times beyond conversion where we experience the filling of the Spirit, the filling of the Spirit, in contrast to being led by the flesh.
[time=2278] Galatians 5 makes this huge comparison, this contrasting picture of times where you and I choose to be either guided by the flesh or filled with the Spirit.
[time=2289] Look at 1 Corinthians, go back to 1 Corinthians 12, if you will, after Romans comes 1 Corinthians 12.
[time=2301] Somebody asked me a couple weeks ago, "Why do you always tell people where the books of the Bible are?"
[time=2308] And I want to just tell you, the reason is that there are folks who trust us enough, who walk into this room every week, and they don't know where it is.
[time=2318] And we're really great with that. Some of you learned it from the day you were born, others of you don't know where Acts is, and you know what, it's okay.
[time=2326] We're really thankful that you're here, and I'm going to always do my best to help you kind of figure that out as we go.
[time=2331] So 1 Corinthians 12, 12, and 13. 1 Corinthians 12, 12, and 13.
[time=2340] Great couple verses for, "Even as the body is one, and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also in Christ, for by one Spirit we were all baptized at conversion into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves are free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
[time=2367] One Spirit, one body, one time, at the point of conversion, the Spirit of God dwells in us." Paul knew this. Paul was very clear about this.
[time=2378] And so then look at Ephesians, go back to our book that we're studying, go back to Galatians Ephesians, go to Ephesians 5, and some folks, they get a little thrown off here where it says in 5, 18.
[time=2392] It says, "And do not get drunk with wine, do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the what?"
[time=2407] Paul knew they were already indwelt by the Spirit. Paul taught them that. Paul taught them in Ephesians 1 about them being sealed when they believed.
[time=2418] So we're not talking about a second baptism, we're not talking about a second indwelling. Paul here refers to the fact, and you and I need to be clear on this, that all through our day to day there are choices that we make.
[time=2432] There are times when we key word here, we submit to the Spirit or we submit to the flesh. And when you and I submit to and are filled with the Spirit, these are the times when you and I speak boldly.
[time=2446] These are the times when you and I live righteously. These are the times when you and I abiding by and under the power and influence of the Spirit do the things God's called us to do and do it well.
[time=2458] Just important that you understand I think the difference is there. Number two, back to our passage, the Holy Spirit is our seal. Praise God.
[time=2466] The Holy Spirit is our seal. Wait till you hear this. In the ancient world, whenever a parcel or package was sent or mailed, so to speak, it was sealed.
[time=2479] Every package or parcel that got sent somewhere had this seal put on it. The seals were unique, connected to and related to the sender.
[time=2490] And the one it was being sent to, the seals were unique and they gave clear indication of origin, authorship and ownership.
[time=2501] The seal gave clear indication of origination, authorship and ownership. The possession then of God's Holy Spirit was and still is today the seal which clearly indicates that a person belongs to God at the point of conversion.
[time=2519] The Spirit of God indwells you and you and I are stamped. You and I are sealed. How do you know you have the indwelling? How do you know you've been sealed?
[time=2531] People ask that question all the time. One answer I think that's very pertinent and very accurate is that the Scriptures also teach that when you've been sealed, when the Spirit of God indwells you, the Spirit of God in time produces these things called fruit.
[time=2546] You should look at it there in Galatians 5, the fruit of the Spirit, indicators that you and I truly have been genuinely saved and sealed in the Holy Spirit.
[time=2556] It's fruit that indicates the presence of the Spirit, not tongues, not miracles, not weird things. We can talk about those things and we will at another point, but you hear a lot about indications of the Spirit and the Spirit, the indication that the Spirit of God dwells in you is the fruit of the Spirit in your life.
[time=2581] It's important that you understand that. The seal of the Holy Spirit, third thing, the seal of the Holy Spirit is a deposit.
[time=2590] The guarantees love that word, our eternal future with God. The seal of the Spirit is a deposit that guarantees our eternal future with God.
[time=2602] Let's do some, as my friend Rod says, some prospecting here of the Scriptures. The word, the Greek word for a pledge or a deposit, depending upon what your translation says, came from the Greek word arhabon, A-R-H-A-B-O in arhabon.
[time=2620] It was a word that meant a down payment made toward the purchase of any item, and it was a deposit that brought with it the pledge that the balance, what was due, in this case eternal life with God, would be paid in full. This is where I, myself, this is where we come to this place of real confidence in the notion of eternal security.
[time=2646] Now, we're not going to take a whole Sunday next week like we did with the election to debate eternal security. There are some who would want to debate that.
[time=2654] To me, it's as clear. To me, it's as comforting. To me, it's as obvious as the day is long that as you study the great doctrine of salvation, and when you see here the beginnings of the great doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the purpose of the Spirit and the sealing and the inheritance and the pledge and the deposit,
[time=2673] the irrevocableness of adoption. To me, it gives me great comfort in knowing that those who genuinely vow the knee of their heart, responding to the call of God, are saved, and nothing can take you, nothing can separate you from the love of God.
[time=2693] So God chooses us. Christ Jesus redeems and forgives us, and the Holy Spirit seals us, keeps us, secures us. We've been blessed.
[time=2711] I'm going to have Adam and the team come on up. And as they make their way up, look with me real quick. Look back. Look back at verse 8. Ephesians 1, end of 7, end of 7, the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of His grace, which He lavished on us.
[time=2739] Hey, my friends, stay with me here just for a minute. Let me just say this to you. Come on, Lord. Thank you.
[time=2747] Thursday, this week, coming up, is an amazing day. And I know it's not a biblical holiday, right? Like Christmas or Resurrection Sunday, but all my friends, the Word of God has filled.
[time=2765] The Word of God has filled with great truth about the way God views and values gratitude and thanksgiving.
[time=2774] And I just got a note from a friend this week. It just encouraged me on this front. And personally, I know in my own heart and life with the bird family this week, we're going to really try and really give this an effort to make this thanksgiving
[time=2791] more than just, gosh, I'm embarrassed to say this, but sometimes in our home, under my leadership, thanksgiving's been a little bit longer prayer before the meal.
[time=2806] And we have been blessed, haven't we, chosen and predestined and adopted and redeemed and forgiven and sealed?
[time=2818] And it's just amazing to come back to that Word in verse 8, and I was looking at it this week, and a friend was looking at it with me, and it's that Word lavished.
[time=2828] Do you know what lavished means? Do you know what it means that God has lavished on you, his grace and mercy and all these blessings?
[time=2838] It's like this. It's like asking your four-year-old to help you bake a cake. Many of you have done it. I have his well. I never make many cakes, but it's like asking a four-year-old to help you bake in the kitchen.
[time=2852] And it's like telling the four-year-old to put two cups of flour in the bowl, and then losing track of the four-year-old, and then going away to do something else, and you come back, and the whole bowl is filled with flour.
[time=2867] Ten cups. He didn't know what he was doing. He was just trying to help, right? But he lavished flour in that bowl. It just means too much. It just means overdone. It means more than was necessary.
[time=2883] And he lavished on you and I, blessings, beyond what we deserved and beyond what we even needed. Amen? And I hope this week, I hope this week that you will, as kids and adults and grandmas and grandpas, when you come to that table on Thursday or even during the week leading up to it, I hope that you'll make an effort to make this Thanksgiving a little special
[time=2907] in the way that you view it, in the way that you participate in it. Let's be a thankful people for the blessings God has given us.
[time=2922] Will you stand with us?
[time=2934] I'm going to sing when I think about the Lord.
[time=2948] When the Holy Ghost healed me to the uttermost, when I think about the Lord, how he beat me up, turned me around, how he set my feet, my solid crown.
[time=2972] And it makes me want to shout, I let you, yeah, thank you, Jesus, Lord, you're worthy of all the glory and all the honor, all the praise.
[time=2989] When I think about the Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me, how he filled me with the Holy Ghost, he healed me to the uttermost, when I think about the Lord, how he beat me up, turned me around,
[time=3018] how he set my feet, my solid crown, it makes me want to shout, I let you, yeah, thank you, Jesus, Lord, you're worthy of all the glory and all the honor, all the praise.
[time=3103] All right, I'm going to teach you a new song this morning, it's pretty simple, the Course just says, "Our God saves," I'm going to sing in the name of the Father.
[time=3118] Lord, we come, yeah, we'll gather together to lift up your name, to call on our Savior, to fall on your grace again, in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, in the name of the Spirit, Lord, we come, yeah, we'll gather together to lift up your name, to call on our Savior.
[time=3147] Come on your grace, hear the joyful sound of our offering as your saints bow down, as your people sing, we will rise with you, let it on your wings, and the world will see there, our God saves, our God saves.
[time=3176] There is hope in your name, morning turns, songs of grace, our God saves, our God saves, the name of the Father, in the name of the Father.
[time=3205] In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, in the name of the Spirit, we'll be come, yeah, we'll gather together to lift up your name, to call on our Savior, to fall on your grace one more time, in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, in the name of the Spirit, Lord, we'll gather together to lift up your name, to call on our Savior.
[time=3234] Come on your grace, hear the joyful sound, hear the joyful sound of our offering, as your saints bow down, as your people sing, we will rise with you, let it on your wings, and the world will see there, our God saves, our God saves.
[time=3263] There is hope in your name, morning turns, songs of grace, our God saves, our God saves, our God saves, our God saves.
[time=3292] Our God saves, joyful sound, hear the joyful sound of our offering, as your saints bow down, as your people sing, we will rise with you, let it on your wings, and the world will see there, our God saves.
[time=3320] Our God saves, there is hope in your name, morning turns, songs of grace, our God saves,
[time=3348] our God saves, morning turns, morning turns, songs of grace, our God saves, our God saves.
[time=3370] As your voice sings, your morning turns, songs of grace, our God saves, our God saves.
[time=3400] Let me just say thanks to Adam and the team, I love it when Corbin does this, Corbin does it on a regular basis, and today Adam and these guys did the same thing, they just laced everything we sang with Ephesians 1 truth, that you catch it, it was everywhere, and all that we sang, and I'm so grateful, so thankful for their willingness to come this morning and serve our body.
[time=3428] Pray with me, pray with me, would you Father God, we leave this place this morning, we'll simply say this, we leave God grateful.
[time=3437] We leave thankful this morning for the blessings that you've bestowed on us, may we never lose sight of them, may they every day inspire us to live the lives God that you called us to live.
[time=3450] God in times of heartache and trouble and loneliness and fear may the reality of your choosing and your adopting and your forgiving and your redeeming and your sealing bring us great hope.
[time=3462] May it change the way we live, Father God give us strength and grace as we leave this place to take this truth and apply it to the way we live our lives and we'll thank you for it.
[time=3476] And all the thankful people in the room agreed with the prayer and said amen.
[time=3506] [MUSIC]
