[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - We're gonna continue to worship this morning, but I wanted to share that story in the middle because Tenash isn't the only adopted one in the room.
[time=40] We all got to listen last Sunday and raise our hands when we all, who believe in Jesus, in this room, get to be called adopted sons and daughters.
[time=49] And we have this marvelous spiritual adoption where our Heavenly Father has looked at us and said, "You're an enemy and you're not my own." And then He gave us Jesus.
[time=59] And He washed us clean and He picked us up and He unfolded us into His family.
[time=64] And He said, "Even though you're not my own, I will call you my own and you'll be my daughter and you'll be my son." And I hope that when you hear me describe that, it moves you to want to worship Him and thank Him and praise Him.
[time=77] So we're gonna sing about Jesus and how amazing He is and how awesome He is and how deep His love is.
[time=84] So let's stand together as adopted sons and daughters of the Most High God.
[time=90] And let's sing this song in thanksgiving and gratitude.
[time=94] (upbeat music)
[time=118] - There is Lord Jesus.
[time=120] [MUSIC - 34 seconds]
[time=159] (upbeat music)
[time=173] [MUSIC - 221 seconds]
[time=400] - Hey man, you may be seated thanks for singing with us.
[time=409] - Micah chapter five has an interesting little verse tucked away in it about Jesus and his birth.
[time=419] In the city it was gonna be in, but you Bethlehem, Ephrithah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me, one who will be ruler of Israel, whose origins are from old from ancient times.
[time=437] It's a great little verse tucked away there in Micah that really sets up while the song that we're gonna sing.
[time=445] I love this time of year.
[time=446] I love the chance to think about Christ's birth and all of the implications that has on his life and his death and his sacrifice and my life and all of eternity.
[time=456] What an amazing, incredible event his birth was.
[time=460] But a lot of times we can just sing familiar songs this time of year and let 'em kind of fall out of our mouths and be a little bit like roped instead of like full of meaning.
[time=470] And these songs that we get to sing at Christmastime just have meaning jam-packed full in every phrase.
[time=478] And I thought before we sang "A Little Town of Bethlehem," we could talk just a little bit about some of the phrases that you'll find in there.
[time=486] Even the title itself I'd always thought growing up, it was just about a quaint little town called Bethlehem.
[time=492] But even that name "A Little Town of Bethlehem," it's talking about Micah chapter five.
[time=497] And Micah chapter five, it says that Bethlehem was the smallest among the clans of Judah and that's something really significant.
[time=504] It's over and over again in scripture gods using the unlikely one to make great things happen so that people see a big red flag.
[time=512] That's not because Bethlehem's anything special.
[time=515] It's 'cause God's really, really special.
[time=518] So it's so cool that God says even though you're the smallest of the clans of Judah, "A Little Town of Bethlehem," out of you will come from a one who will be ruler of Israel whose origins are from old, from ancient times.
[time=531] I love that.
[time=533] There's some other verses, or sorry, some other parts of the song that we're gonna sing that remind me of verses in the Bible.
[time=541] We sing it every year.
[time=541] God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heaven.
[time=545] We stop and think about it and where we're at even in the book of Ephesians, incredible.
[time=550] That God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.
[time=554] So when we sing together in a minute, God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heaven, think of Ephesians chapter one.
[time=561] In that same part of the song, it says, "Meek souls will receive him still." It's the meek souls that receive Christ in a reminder me of the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes right at the beginning of Matthew chapter five where Jesus said, "Blessed are the meek, "for they will inherit the earth." And we sing it again in this song that it's the meek ones that accept Christ, that inherit the earth.
[time=588] A phrase in the song, "Be born in us today." I thought of John three.
[time=594] John three Nicodemus comes to Jesus in the night and he asks this really important question, "What do I have to do to be born?" Or excuse me, "What do I have to do to be saved?" And Jesus' answer is, "Be born again." Jesus was born in the little town of Bethlehem, but Jesus needs to be born in our hearts and he needs to revitalize our souls with his life and his breath and his born again spirit.
[time=618] We'll sing also this phrase, "Oh come to us abide in us, our Lord Emmanuel." What a great prayer.
[time=629] It happens so fast.
[time=630] Come to us, God abide in us.
[time=633] And I think of abiding in John chapter 15, some translations say, "Remain in me and I'll remain in you." Another translation says, "Abide in me and I will abide in you." And it's this mutual abiding process that's absolutely beautiful where we're abiding in God and God himself is abiding in us and Jesus says, "We'll bear much fruit." That's my prayer for you and for me and for all of us that this Christmas season we would abide in him and that he would abide in us and bear much fruit in our lives.
[time=664] So let's sing together, hopefully, little town of Bethlehem but with some extra meaning and some extra focus and some extra heart with it today, okay?
[time=673] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=837] (piano music) [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=867] (piano music) - Lord God, would you abide in us?
[time=878] And would you dwell in our hearts today?
[time=882] Would you be God with Blackhawk?
[time=886] Be God with your church?
[time=888] And be God with each one of us in this room today?
[time=892] And would we see much fruit born in our lives today and through the rest of this season?
[time=898] So that you would be honored and you would be glorified and your kingdom would come and your will would be done and we would see great works in this city and this land because you are Emmanuel, God with us.
[time=912] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=916] - Hey, good morning everybody.
[time=919] Good to see all of you.
[time=920] Did you eat enough on Thursday?
[time=922] Did you run enough on Friday?
[time=925] Everybody doing all right?
[time=926] We are, I'll tell you what, we're so grateful.
[time=929] I know our family, I know many of you as well.
[time=931] Just grateful beyond words for the blessings that we were able to remember this past week, thankful for the time that we had together.
[time=940] And I'm so grateful for this time.
[time=942] I've been so looking forward to the privilege of getting to share with you the things that I get to see and read and study each week in God's Word.
[time=950] And I'm so looking forward to what we're gonna see this morning in the book of Ephesians in our study, the truth, the way, the life, our look into this great letter from the Apostle Paul to the church at Ephesus.
[time=964] And if you've got your Bibles with you, please open them up to Ephesians chapter one where we come to in verse 15, one of the most amazing, one of the most insightful, one of the most incredible prayers you're ever gonna read.
[time=980] One of the most encouraging prayers you're ever gonna get a chance to look into.
[time=984] It is an amazing prayer.
[time=986] It's wording and it's intent and it's scope.
[time=991] It's just really, really an amazing thing.
[time=996] And I wanted to say this too, before we start out, I was thinking about it this week.
[time=1000] "Is there anybody in the room who like me?" I mean, we're talking about an amazing prayer.
[time=1008] Is there anybody in the room who sometimes feels like I do that my prayers aren't that amazing?
[time=1016] Anybody ever feel that way?
[time=1019] All right, I'm not alone.
[time=1020] I mean, I'm trying, right?
[time=1021] I mean, oftentimes we get in those spots where what we wanna pray for or who we wanna pray for or the circumstance that we wanna bring before God.
[time=1029] Sometimes we just feel compelled in our hearts and there's a real genuine motive there and we really want it to go well and then we get down on our knees or we pull over in the car or we're there in our office by ourselves and we kinda give it a shot and it just doesn't seem very amazing.
[time=1044] Sometimes it doesn't seem like maybe it went anywhere.
[time=1048] I want you to know this morning that it always goes somewhere that God hears you but I wanna encourage you with a verse that some of you maybe are very familiar with but for others of you, you know what?
[time=1059] It might be a new encouragement to you.
[time=1061] Go to Romans eight.
[time=1063] I wanna just remind you of this great prayer truth and this is sorta related but not really.
[time=1070] I just thought of it and I wanted to share it with you on this general topic of prayer and the struggle that sometimes you like me might have in the midst of that.
[time=1080] Look at Romans eight, 26.
[time=1083] It says there, Paul again writing here to the church at Rome, in the same way the spirit also helps our weakness.
[time=1091] Did you know this?
[time=1092] For we do not know how to pray as we should.
[time=1097] Do I hear an amen?
[time=1098] But the spirit himself intercedes for us
[time=1104] with groanings too deep for words and he who searches the heart, God, knows what the mind of the spirit is because he intercedes the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
[time=1122] And I just wanna encourage you with that.
[time=1126] The spirit of God who we learned last week dwells within you at the point of redemption, at the point of salvation, God gifts us with the spirit of God, the spirit indwells us.
[time=1138] We're sealed in the spirit so the spirit never what?
[time=1141] Leaves us and every time you get on your knees, every time you fold your hands, every time you offer up that prayer as botched and fragmented as it might feel, the spirit of God intercedes for you.
[time=1159] Did you know that?
[time=1161] And there isn't anything on your heart and there isn't anything on your mind and there isn't anything that you wish God could hear from you that God, what?
[time=1173] It doesn't because the spirit of God, and I'm gonna just say this and then we'll come back to where we're supposed to be.
[time=1180] I wanna say this, the spirit of God intercedes with groanings, you're not just a number.
[time=1188] It's not like he's just saying, hey God, yeah,
[time=1194] the dude over there in Indiana, he's got a word for you, good things.
[time=1199] No, it says he on your behalf, on yours, he groans with words that we couldn't even understand.
[time=1209] It's so deep and it's so real and it's so rich
[time=1216] and he loves you that much and he wants you to be before God and all of your needs and the things that you understand and the things that you don't.
[time=1225] And I believe the text teaches there's times when you're praying when he does that for you, I think it also implies there's times where we're not praying where he does that for you.
[time=1233] Amen?
[time=1237] What a great truth.
[time=1238] All right, back to Paul's prayer.
[time=1241] Before we get to Paul's prayer, here in Ephesians 1, I wanna, the prayer is in 17, 18 and 19.
[time=1250] I wanna show you how he begins this passage in 15 and 16.
[time=1255] It is a great, just introduction filled with some things I think we need to stop and take a look at.
[time=1261] So look with me, if you would, Ephesians chapter one verses 15 and 16.
[time=1269] For this reason, what's that mean?
[time=1272] For this reason?
[time=1272] Well, everything we just looked at, the last couple of weeks with all of that of you and the reality of that and the great gift of your salvation and the great promise of his spirit.
[time=1285] For this reason, I too, Paul says, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints.
[time=1297] Do not cease for 16.
[time=1299] Do not cease giving thanks for you while making mention of you in my prayers.
[time=1306] Three things I want you to see right out of the text, but I want you to be mindful of as we start out this look into his prayer.
[time=1316] Right there, you see, he is so grateful.
[time=1319] The end of that little two verse passage I read.
[time=1322] He is so thankful, he's thanking God without ceasing, why?
[time=1327] Why is he so thankful?
[time=1329] Well, point number one here, just from 15 and 16.
[time=1333] Point number one, from prison in Rome, he hears about their faith in the Lord Jesus.
[time=1339] Now you may just read over that, you may just skim over that, that may not seem like a big deal to you, but let me just tell you.
[time=1347] Let me tell you what a big deal it is to Paul.
[time=1355] Listen, to anybody who's ever cared for any one spiritually.
[time=1360] Any small group you've ever led,
[time=1366] any class you've ever taught, any church you've ever pastored, any ministry you've ever been engaged with when you and me and I can think of so many others I've known over the years who have invested so much of themselves and the truth into so many.
[time=1383] Listen, anytime you're ever engaged in that process.
[time=1388] Paul was engaged in that process in Ephesus.
[time=1390] Now Paul's not in Ephesus.
[time=1393] Now Paul's in Rome, in prison.
[time=1395] Paul doesn't see what's going on.
[time=1397] Paul's not there to guard and protect.
[time=1399] Paul's not in the city limits.
[time=1401] No, Paul's been detached.
[time=1402] He's been removed from that place.
[time=1405] He doesn't know, he can't see, he can't help.
[time=1407] Do you understand one of the most,
[time=1413] one of the most discouraging things that I encounter in my life?
[time=1422] And it happens every once in a while.
[time=1425] It's when I bump into somebody.
[time=1431] Well, I haven't seen it in a long time.
[time=1433] You know, I've been here long enough for this to have happened, you know, here in this context.
[time=1441] But there are times when I'll bump into somebody, haven't seen him in a long time.
[time=1445] I feel bad the minute I see him, 'cause I think, man, I haven't seen him in a long time.
[time=1449] And you know, I didn't call him, I didn't write him, and I didn't even know they weren't around.
[time=1453] And maybe it's been two, three, four, five years.
[time=1456] And one of the most discouraging things I ever experienced is when I get into a conversation with that person, that guy or that gal, and it becomes very evident, very quickly, that they're not walking with the Lord anymore.
[time=1469] That they're done.
[time=1472] However you wanna say that, they changed their mind.
[time=1476] They got hurt, they got mad, they got ticked, they left, they're bitter, and you can sense it.
[time=1484] I can sense it, I can hear it in their voice, I can see it in their eyes.
[time=1487] They don't wanna talk to me, they don't wanna be around me, they don't wanna hear about Black Hawk.
[time=1493] Some things happen, and they're gone.
[time=1496] And when you invest in people, and when you give your life away to people, when you try to care for them and shepherd them, and maybe you did it directly, or maybe you're trying to do it indirectly, when that happens, that is a heartbreak.
[time=1510] And the transverse is equally as uplifting, and I know I've said this to you before, but I'm gonna keep saying it to you again and again.
[time=1519] Every week you walk through that door, every time I get to see you, as here a pastor is talking to his people, and I'm telling you, every week you walk through that door, and I get to see you, there's a part of my heart that goes, they're still at it.
[time=1536] We're still in this together.
[time=1539] That may have been a good week, it may have been a bad week, but to know of your faith in the Lord.
[time=1544] Can't tell you how many college kids, I've bumped into this weekend, students home for the break, and every time I get to bump into one, who still has a little bit of that light in their eye, and a little bit of jump in their step, and a sense of spiritual purpose, and you can kinda tell that it means a lot to them still, I thank God that they're still at it.
[time=1567] There is a sense in the heart of a pastor, when he hears about their faith in the Lord.
[time=1572] Paul had been gone for a while, times were tough and Ephesus, the debauchery of the temple of Taino, was persistent as ever.
[time=1580] The allurement of idolatry was everywhere, and he hears from Epaphras that they're still at it, and he's thankful.
[time=1588] He's thankful about their faith in the Lord Jesus.
[time=1593] From prison number two, from prison in Rome, he hears about their love for all the saints.
[time=1599] He thanks God without ceasing, because he hears about what their love, their faith in the Lord, and their love for all the saints.
[time=1610] You say, okay, what's the big deal about their love for all the saints?
[time=1614] Go back in your, I'll try to make sense of this for you, go back to the back of your New Testament, go all the way to Revelation, and then just start going backwards.
[time=1624] Go to 1 John.
[time=1628] First John, not gonna be on the screen, so turn real quick.
[time=1633] Thumb through those great pages, if you will.
[time=1636] 1 John 3, verses 14 and 15.
[time=1639] Paul hears from Epaphras in this report about the church's edeficists, that their faith in the Lord has intact them, that they're evidencing this love for all the saints.
[time=1650] We know, it says in 1 John, 1 John 3, 14,
[time=1656] we know that we have passed out of death into life.
[time=1661] Translated, we've been redeemed.
[time=1663] You know that you've passed out of death into life because we, what, say it out loud, love the brethren.
[time=1672] He who does not love abides in what?
[time=1678] Death.
[time=1680] Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
[time=1690] Go to 1 John 4, 1 John 4, 16.
[time=1695] There, I hear those pages turning, good job.
[time=1699] We have come to know, 1 John 4, 16, we have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us.
[time=1705] God is what?
[time=1707] Say it, love.
[time=1709] And those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in him.
[time=1717] By this love is perfected with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment.
[time=1724] How do you have confidence in the day of judgment?
[time=1727] Because your life is marked by a consistent loving of others.
[time=1732] Look at verse 20, 1 John 4, someone says, I love God and hates his brother.
[time=1740] Doesn't love him, he is a liar.
[time=1745] For those who, for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God, whom he has what?
[time=1755] Not seen.
[time=1756] Just go down to five, five one.
[time=1759] 1 John 5, one.
[time=1760] Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=1763] Raise your hands if you believe that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=1767] Okay, hands down.
[time=1768] That person is born of God and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of him.
[time=1777] That means you love, if you're his.
[time=1780] And if you're his, you love the brother.
[time=1782] You love the one that's easy to love.
[time=1785] You love the pretty one.
[time=1786] You love the ugly one.
[time=1787] You love the difficult one.
[time=1789] You love the one that stretches you.
[time=1790] You love the one that doesn't dress like you.
[time=1793] You love the one that doesn't make as much as you.
[time=1795] You love.
[time=1797] I love you.
[time=1799] You love me.
[time=1800] We love each other in difficult times.
[time=1802] Nothing can deter us from the willingness and the readiness to evidence that love.
[time=1809] Now, bring it back to our passage.
[time=1810] Why is he so thankful for this?
[time=1813] He's thankful for this.
[time=1815] I'm telling you for this reason because separated from them.
[time=1817] Now having spent some time apart from them, having invested so much in them, he's wondering, don't kid yourself.
[time=1823] He's wondering if what went on there is real.
[time=1827] And if I want to know, years removed from my time with you, if what went on here is real.
[time=1835] And I hear that you're loving each other
[time=1842] radically and faithfully and diligently.
[time=1845] I'm grateful because that means what's going on there is of who, is of God.
[time=1851] If there's not love going on, it's not of him.
[time=1856] You may say something, but unless you're life in mind, evidence it by the expression of love.
[time=1862] It's not true.
[time=1866] From prison in Rome, he hears about their faith in the Lord.
[time=1869] From prison in Rome, he hears about their love for all the saints.
[time=1873] From prison, Paul, thanks God for the Ephesians.
[time=1877] And he thanks God unceasingly.
[time=1881] He loved him that much.
[time=1883] He never stops thanking God for those two things.
[time=1887] It was that important to him.
[time=1890] Okay, back to the prayer.
[time=1892] What does God, excuse me, what does Paul pray for?
[time=1895] Verses 17 through the first part of 19.
[time=1899] All right, you're there, here we go.
[time=1900] Ephesians 1, 17, Ephesians 1, 17 through the first part
[time=1909] of 19, and it says this, says that the God, he makes mention of them in his prayers.
[time=1918] Verse 17, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of glory, that phrase there literally means the possessor of glory, the father of glory, the one who owns and has and possesses all glory, that he may give to you a spirit of wisdom and a spirit of revelation in the knowledge of him, that he may grant you or give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, he prays further in verse 18, that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you will know what is the, listen, the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance, and what is the verse 19, the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe.
[time=1969] This is, this is big.
[time=1973] This is really, really huge.
[time=1976] And I don't say that just because it's a huge prayer.
[time=1979] It's an amazing prayer, but it's so huge because of the context.
[time=1984] I don't want you to miss this.
[time=1985] First of all, who's praying?
[time=1987] And I know that we don't rank people.
[time=1989] I know that we don't, that I'm no better than you and you're no better than me.
[time=1993] And because you sit there and you sit there, no big, that's true.
[time=1996] We're all the same, all equal in God's eyes.
[time=1998] I'm just telling you, this is Paul.
[time=2000] This is a great prayer and the author of it, if you will, the one whose heart it comes out of, it's worth looking at.
[time=2010] This is Paul.
[time=2011] This is Saul converted on the Damascus road by God directly called into ministry to buy and large birth the New Testament church.
[time=2022] And he's got something he wants to pray for you.
[time=2026] And I kind of put those dots together and I wanna hear what Paul has to pray for you and for me.
[time=2033] You with me?
[time=2035] Who's praying Paul?
[time=2036] Where's he praying from?
[time=2037] Don't forget this, he's praying from prison.
[time=2041] He's incarcerated, he's in chains.
[time=2045] He knows that the end of his road, for the most part, he's realizing that his time is coming up.
[time=2052] The days are growing short, this probably isn't gonna end well.
[time=2056] And he realizes this and yet in his chains and his bondage, his heart continues to break and cry out for those whom he loves and those whom he's pastored and built into.
[time=2069] It's Paul, he's praying from prison.
[time=2072] Time's running out and what's at stake?
[time=2075] What's at stake?
[time=2076] The early churches don't miss this.
[time=2078] What's at stake here?
[time=2078] I believe in Paul's heart and mind is the survival of the early church.
[time=2083] It means everything to him.
[time=2086] God has entrusted him with these churches and their futures and he's built into these places and these men and women and now he realizes his time is running out.
[time=2097] Now he knows how important it is that they get it right.
[time=2100] Not gonna get a whole lot of opportunities from here on out.
[time=2105] So everything's set or done, it's got to count.
[time=2108] So I think he chooses, I think he prays his words very carefully.
[time=2113] This isn't some quick, God is great, God is good.
[time=2118] Let us thank him for our food thing.
[time=2121] This is really, really profound.
[time=2125] This is really thought through.
[time=2127] This is really important and while it's written to them, it is for you and I.
[time=2131] So okay, here we go, back to the prayer.
[time=2133] What does Paul pray for?
[time=2136] Verse 17, two things, right out of the gate.
[time=2138] You gotta write these down, don't miss this.
[time=2140] A spirit, he prays for a spirit of wisdom.
[time=2143] You see it there?
[time=2144] A spirit of wisdom that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory may give to you a spirit of wisdom.
[time=2150] Stop there.
[time=2152] What is wisdom?
[time=2153] He wants to give you, he wants God to give you, he prays.
[time=2159] He knows these people and he knows what they need and he prays that God would give them a spirit of wisdom.
[time=2167] And I know you may kind of think you know what it means and you kind of might have a decent understanding but be really clear here as we think about this.
[time=2174] Wisdom, the application of God's heart.
[time=2178] It is the ability to, it is the readiness to apply.
[time=2182] God's heart, what God thinks, what God says is true, what God says is right, what God says is best.
[time=2191] It's the application of God's heart to the everyday of life.
[time=2197] All of your life, your life at home, your life with your kids, your life in your mind, by yourself, your life at work, your life on the ball field, your life wherever you go, whatever you're doing, you Paul believes because he prays for it for you, you need and I need wisdom.
[time=2219] He knows it was the great need of their day
[time=2226] as they tried their best to live in Ephesus right there in the shadow of Diana and if you missed our message at the beginning of the series on the situation there in Ephesus you should pick it up and listen to it.
[time=2239] He knew they needed wisdom.
[time=2242] Divine, last part of that definition, divine discernment for the everyday of life.
[time=2250] What would, here's wisdom, what would God do?
[time=2252] You've got decisions you're making.
[time=2256] You've got circumstances that you're trying to deal with.
[time=2259] What would God do?
[time=2262] Don't think any situation is too small to apply that question to.
[time=2268] The answer is wisdom.
[time=2271] Whatever God would do there, that's your realization of that.
[time=2275] You being able to understand and see that and make that choice, that is wisdom.
[time=2281] He prays for a spirit of wisdom and a spirit of revelation.
[time=2285] I love this, revelation.
[time=2287] Write it down, the clarity that comes.
[time=2290] My goodness, anybody in the room, other than me, need clarity at times in life.
[time=2297] It is the clarity that comes from being exposed to what God reveals most importantly through his word.
[time=2309] Most importantly, God reveals to you how you should choose.
[time=2313] See, see, Paul understood that these people needed to, they needed to speak a certain way.
[time=2319] They needed to live a certain way.
[time=2321] They needed to think and value in a certain way.
[time=2325] And he knew they needed to have revelation.
[time=2327] They needed to have God shine down on them, clarity, so they knew which way to go, how to choose, how to live.
[time=2337] You with me?
[time=2339] The clarity that comes from being exposed to what God reveals.
[time=2343] My oldest son, my youngest son, Jake and Russell and me,
[time=2349] we're driving to the night.
[time=2351] Russell's just started driving, he's doing great, and I'm just giving him a little lesson on lights.
[time=2355] We're just having fun, we're just country road, just pitch dark, just we're just tooling down this road.
[time=2360] I'm like, hey guys, watch.
[time=2362] And I just show him how, you know, normal lights, you know, we're just doing his bushes and thickets on both sides, just normal lights.
[time=2368] And I watch this and you push the lever, push it forward, and then it goes bright.
[time=2373] I'm like, whoa, that's cool.
[time=2374] I said, but watch this.
[time=2376] I learned this, I said, I don't know how many years I went without realizing this.
[time=2379] I felt kind of stupid when I finally realized it.
[time=2381] But when you pull that lever to you, you get both the regular lights and the bright lights, and it's super bright.
[time=2387] I call it super bright lights.
[time=2390] And we were pulling that lever and I'm telling you, the whole road just, boom, just lights up.
[time=2394] We're like looking at people's living room.
[time=2396] So, like, how are you?
[time=2397] I mean, we can see deer 100 yards in the thick.
[time=2399] I mean, it's just amazing.
[time=2400] The boy's like, whoa.
[time=2402] And that's, that's what I need.
[time=2407] I won't speak for you.
[time=2409] But I need that, I need super light.
[time=2414] I need super bright revelation.
[time=2417] I need God to just reveal and bring clarity and allow me to see.
[time=2423] Anybody in the room need that?
[time=2425] I need that desperately.
[time=2427] And Paul prays for a spirit of revelation, clarity, and exposure to the light of God.
[time=2434] I love this.
[time=2436] I love how, I love the text.
[time=2438] It's right there.
[time=2439] How, look at it for yourself.
[time=2441] How do you get those two things according to the text, according to Paul's words?
[time=2446] He says that God would grant you, give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of who?
[time=2455] Say it, Christ, you need wisdom?
[time=2460] You need revelation.
[time=2462] He says, great.
[time=2464] Then, then be, then be closer to Christ.
[time=2469] Know him more intimately.
[time=2473] Know him better.
[time=2475] Walk with him more persistently.
[time=2478] Hold on to him more faithfully.
[time=2481] Read him, listen to him.
[time=2483] Sing him, surround yourself with him.
[time=2486] 'Cause in the knowledge of him comes wisdom and revelation.
[time=2491] And that's what we're trying to do here.
[time=2497] We're trying to grow you up to be followers of the ways of who, him.
[time=2504] So you can have wisdom and a spirit of revelation.
[time=2509] Wow.
[time=2510] And a lightened heart, let's keep going.
[time=2512] He not only prays for a spirit of wisdom and revelation, but as the text continues there in 18, I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened.
[time=2521] Most of you didn't know your heart had eyes.
[time=2524] Spiritually speaking, did you know that?
[time=2526] Your heart has eyes and the eyes of your heart can be enlightened.
[time=2532] Eyes of the heart would indicate that your heart kind of goes places.
[time=2536] Does that make sense?
[time=2540] It does, doesn't it?
[time=2542] Your heart, your heart and mind, they lead us places, don't they?
[time=2547] Our heart, our soul moves us in directions.
[time=2552] There's something about the heart, the seat of our emotions and our will.
[time=2556] It's very important, it's directive in nature.
[time=2559] And he wants the eyes of your heart to be opened.
[time=2563] He wants the eyes of your heart enlightened.
[time=2566] You remember from Romans 1, we were there not too long ago.
[time=2571] You remember from Romans 1, what happens to the person whose heart isn't enlightened, but whose heart is darkened.
[time=2584] Do you remember 1, 21?
[time=2586] For even though they knew God, they knew about him, they hadn't surrendered to him, they knew about God.
[time=2593] They did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was what, say it, darkened.
[time=2603] And then we won't go on, but 22, three, four, all the way down that path that's just paints this picture of this just debauched, immoral, spiraling, wandering away from God, all because our heart wasn't enlightened, it was darkened.
[time=2620] And Paul says, no, you've come to faith in Christ and I want your hearts to be enlightened.
[time=2624] And when your heart is enlightened, you get three things.
[time=2630] He prays it right here.
[time=2631] He prays that their heart would be enlightened so that that would allow you to know and see the hope of his choosing, the riches of his inheritance and the greatness of his power.
[time=2645] I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you will know beyond a shadow of a doubt what is the hope of his calling?
[time=2655] What are the riches of the glory of his inheritance?
[time=2660] And the saints and what is thirdly, what is the surpassing greatness of the power, of his power toward us, for us who believe?
[time=2671] Let's talk about that just for a moment.
[time=2674] I hope you'll write some of these things down.
[time=2676] The hope of his choosing.
[time=2678] What is the hope?
[time=2679] Listen, you can write that down.
[time=2681] And as you write that down, also turn to Romans eight.
[time=2686] Go to Romans eight, 29.
[time=2689] Here is my friends, the hope.
[time=2691] Here's what you and I can hope for knowing we've been chosen.
[time=2695] And we talked about being chosen three weeks ago in Ephesians one, the very first few verses.
[time=2699] Here is the hope of his choosing.
[time=2702] Look at Romans eight, 29.
[time=2705] For those whom he foreknew, he also predestined.
[time=2710] For those whom he chose, talking about the doctrine of election there, for those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to become what?
[time=2721] Here's the hope of your choosing.
[time=2722] That you will be conformed to the image of his son.
[time=2727] God's word promises you that in your choosing, in his choosing of you, in his ceiling of you, in the spirit, in the redeeming, in the forgiving work of God through Jesus Christ, you are going to be made molded and shaped.
[time=2745] Sometimes it's gonna hurt a little.
[time=2749] Sometimes it's going to bring some discomfort, but you're going to be made to be like him.
[time=2755] And you can hang on to that.
[time=2759] That's the truth, it's the absolute truth.
[time=2762] An enlightened heart knows it has peace.
[time=2767] An enlightened heart knows that beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you're being molded and shaped to be like Christ in the midst of whatever hardship you might be facing, the enlightened heart knows, good will come from pain.
[time=2781] You can take it to the bank, good will come.
[time=2786] God's good in your life will come in time through the pain and the difficulty and whatever hardship you might be facing.
[time=2793] For someone who is his peace will prevail.
[time=2798] It is the hope of your choosing.
[time=2805] And you know what, there's many of you in the room this morning, and you need that peace.
[time=2810] You need to re-embrace the reality and the truth
[time=2816] of that peace, and you know what?
[time=2820] That's why he prays that for you.
[time=2823] He wants you to know the riches of your inheritance.
[time=2829] He prays that your heart, that the eyes of your heart would be enlightened so that you would know the riches of your inheritance.
[time=2836] What does this mean?
[time=2839] An enlightened heart, here's what it means, an enlightened heart isn't confused, my friends, or distracted by the offer of earthly riches.
[time=2850] Now we're back to idolatry.
[time=2852] He doesn't want that for you.
[time=2854] Didn't want it for them.
[time=2855] Living an idolatry, central, Ephesus.
[time=2858] He says no, no, no, no, no, I pray that the eyes of your heart will be enlightened so that you will understand, not be distracted.
[time=2864] By the offer of earthly riches or the insatiable drive
[time=2871] for more of the world's possessions, the enlightened heart understands deeply and sees clearly, there's revelation, there's the clarity, that the wealth, the riches, the provision that is really theirs in Christ.
[time=2888] The enlightened heart understands how all that works.
[time=2891] The darkened heart doesn't.
[time=2893] The enlightened heart understands the great blessing of Ephesians one, three to 14, all we just looked at.
[time=2900] And they are filled up with.
[time=2903] They are so grateful for, and they understand the great wealth that is theirs.
[time=2911] You need that kind of, I call that security.
[time=2917] The hope in his choosing, you know what that is?
[time=2919] That's peace.
[time=2921] The understanding of your riches, the inheritance of God, that's security.
[time=2925] People think earthly wealth brings security.
[time=2928] They realize in time it doesn't.
[time=2930] We understand heavenly wealth does bring security.
[time=2935] And lastly, the greatness of his power.
[time=2938] You say, why would I need to be reminded?
[time=2942] Why would he pray for me that I would be reminded that my enlightened heart would see and lay hold of the greatness of his power?
[time=2949] Here's why.
[time=2954] Because there's somebody in the room this morning.
[time=2963] And you're so in over your head financially that you're about to go under.
[time=2972] And you're swimming so hard and so fat.
[time=2976] You are desperate.
[time=2978] And in that state, you have become weak and lost
[time=2984] and scared, and you feel powerless.
[time=2991] There are people in this room this morning.
[time=2994] And you are just desperately.
[time=2998] And sometimes it seems futilely trying to deal with and pay attention to an addiction in your life.
[time=3006] It may be pornography, it may be food.
[time=3009] It may be buying things you can't afford.
[time=3012] It may be, maybe all kinds of things.
[time=3018] But you're struggling and it's winning and you feel powerless.
[time=3023] There could be some in the room this morning.
[time=3029] You're still, you're still trying.
[time=3032] In and of your own strength to forgive him or her
[time=3039] for their unfaithfulness.
[time=3041] And maybe it's been months, maybe it's been years.
[time=3047] But it is eating you up.
[time=3050] Your marriage isn't getting better.
[time=3052] Peace has not returned.
[time=3053] And you feel powerless in the midst of that friction
[time=3060] and tension.
[time=3061] Some of you in the room, there could be several.
[time=3067] You've come to a place where you've got to have people call you in the morning to get you out of bed.
[time=3072] You're just that discouraged.
[time=3077] You're just that depressed.
[time=3079] It just seems that futile.
[time=3081] You haven't seen the dawn of a new day in a long, long time.
[time=3086] And it's just eating you up and you feel powerless.
[time=3090] Some have been told that you have cancer.
[time=3093] Some have been told you'll never have children.
[time=3098] Some have a difficult mom or dad.
[time=3105] Even some of you maybe adolescents and some of you maybe growing adults and you're still trying to figure out how to show honor and respect to a mom and dad that make it very, very difficult.
[time=3114] And you just sometimes feel powerless and you want to give up.
[time=3117] You say, are you making these things up?
[time=3124] No.
[time=3124] All that's going on.
[time=3128] Right here.
[time=3130] And here's what I want to end with today.
[time=3134] Two things.
[time=3135] Number one, I want to read towards the end of the prayer.
[time=3139] I want to read you about this power and I want to make that connection for you.
[time=3143] Why would he pray for you and all those needs?
[time=3146] I just listed.
[time=3147] Why would he pray for power?
[time=3149] Because look, look at the look at the kind of power it is that
[time=3156] he's praying you'll lay hold of.
[time=3159] It says there in Ephesians.
[time=3164] Verse 19, what the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe and then look at 20, this power, this power which he brought about in Christ when he God raised him Jesus from
[time=3181] the what and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places.
[time=3187] My son, my daughters, they got a CD that got it in my car.
[time=3194] It's just in my car, so I listen to it all the time.
[time=3197] I don't even know the title of it.
[time=3197] I think it's Hillsong.
[time=3198] Track nine starts out the same power that opened, same power
[time=3204] that what conquered the grave?
[time=3210] The same power that conquered the grave lives in you.
[time=3214] They just sing it.
[time=3215] It's a chorus they sing.
[time=3216] The same power that conquered the grave lives in you.
[time=3221] The same power.
[time=3222] Are you listening?
[time=3225] You're finding it hard to forgive, are you?
[time=3230] That addiction getting the best of you?
[time=3233] I'm in a difficult time in some relationships.
[time=3236] The same power that conquered the grave lives in you.
[time=3243] Anybody want to say amen?
[time=3245] Anybody want to say thank you God, just say it.
[time=3248] The same power that God used and exercised to defeat death
[time=3254] and conquer the grave he gives to you in his son.
[time=3259] And Paul prays because he knows everything I just rattled off there is true about you and it was true about them and he knew they wouldn't make it unless they laid hold of the power of God.
[time=3270] That's available to those who know him.
[time=3274] Well hello everybody, I've asked our crew if they would this week to put this insert at the end of the message today.
[time=3283] And I did it with some real thought and intention.
[time=3287] As you've watched the message you realize that as we ended our time there in the room that morning I asked those who needed prayer.
[time=3295] Those who wanted to in essence have Paul's prayer from Ephesians 1 prayed over them.
[time=3302] You know they came forward and it was an incredibly special and meaningful time and I just didn't want to rob you of that experience.
[time=3311] I tell you all the time that though you might not be in the room we consider you part of this family and we want what happens in the room to be something that can be very real to you.
[time=3322] And so I just want to know how it is we can pray for you specifically.
[time=3327] I want to pray for you here this morning and I'll do that but I want you to email me.
[time=3332] So many times so many of you do that but my email is right there on the bottom of the screen and I would personally love nothing more than it just takes some time this next week.
[time=3342] And remember you as it relates to this prayer.
[time=3346] Do you need wisdom?
[time=3348] Do you need a spirit of revelation as we've described it to you this morning?
[time=3354] Do you need the eyes of your heart enlightened so that you can better understand and grasp the hope the hope of your calling, the security, the riches of your inheritance?
[time=3370] Do you need to be reminded?
[time=3371] Do you need a better understanding of this great power, the power that raised Jesus from the dead?
[time=3378] This great power that's available to you in Christ.
[time=3381] Do you need a greater, more personal, more real and authentic understanding and experience of that power?
[time=3388] As you've heard the message all of that makes sense to you I hope and I just want to know how I can pray for you on those fronts.
[time=3396] And it means a lot to us that you tune in each week.
[time=3399] It means a great deal to us that we have this relationship and so please don't hesitate.
[time=3403] Just shoot me a short or long email.
[time=3406] It doesn't matter and let me know along those lines how I can pray for you in the days to come.
[time=3411] And let me just say this as I close.
[time=3413] Father God in heaven I pray for my dear brothers and sisters, friends, some part of the family of God and some still searching and seeking to better understand you God and the great gift of your son.
[time=3428] But Father I pray for those watching now and I pray you would give them great comfort and great peace in this season.
[time=3435] I pray that as we communicate back and forth God that you would give them the opportunity to have this prayer prayed for them.
[time=3442] And I pray that as we walk this road together, God you'd bring great encouragement, that you would bring great peace and that you would bring great hope.
[time=3450] Thank you for this family of Blackhawk.
[time=3453] And thank you for those who watch each week.
[time=3456] God I pray that you'd be with them and give them courage to face all that they'll face and see in the days to come.
[time=3462] For it's in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3465] Hey, I pray that prayer for you.
[time=3467] I mean that we're grateful for you and want to do everything we can to come alongside.
[time=3472] So write me this week, shoot me an email.
[time=3474] Let me know how I can specifically with Paul's prayer in mind, how I can specifically pray for you.
[time=3480] God bless you.
[time=3481] Have a great week.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
