[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Twist the day before Christmas and all through the store, every shopper was frantic to buy even more.
[time=42] The merchandise hung in each aisle with great care, tempting each customer passing by there.
[time=49] The children kept pointing out more and more toys that they wanted for being said to good girls and boys.
[time=56] Mom had no credit, a dad had no cash, but that never stopped them at all in the past.
[time=63] The owner was thrilled and he called out again.
[time=66] - Just one day 'til Christmas, keep shopping my friends.
[time=70] - Shoppers, may I have your attention, please.
[time=73] For your final day of Christmas shopping here at Herod's department store, we have a special musical treat up on the second floor.
[time=81] Next to the toy department, we have the children's choir from Calvary Community Church.
[time=86] Stop by and listen as they recreate the major scene with inspiring holiday music.
[time=91] Would you welcome them to Herod's department store?
[time=94] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 121 seconds]
[time=221] (audience applauding)
[time=228] - Ms. O'Reilly, Ms. O'Reilly, what is this?
[time=231] What is going on in the middle of my store?
[time=234] - Oh, Mr. Herod, it's a children's choir from Calvary Community Church.
[time=238] I invited them, aren't they just adorable?
[time=241] - Ms. O'Reilly, I can't have this?
[time=243] Look, they're distracting all my customers.
[time=246] This is the last shopping day before Christmas.
[time=248] There's just no room for them here.
[time=250] They have got to go.
[time=252] (audience gasping) - Attention, Herod shoppers.
[time=256] Just for you, there's an extra 10% off in the jewelry department on all gold for the next 10 minutes.
[time=264] Did you hear him?
[time=266] He said there's no room for us in the manger.
[time=269] Ms. O'Reilly, you got me into this, so now you're going to fix it.
[time=273] That is, if you still want your Christmas bonus.
[time=276] Mr. Herod's speaking.
[time=278] Oh, hi, mother.
[time=279] No, no, no, I haven't forgotten you.
[time=281] Yes, I know you're the only house on Elm Street without their Christmas lights.
[time=285] Mother, I promise I'll get over there.
[time=286] I've got to go now.
[time=288] Bye.
[time=290] Ms. O'Reilly, my Christmas is too busy to be bothered by all of this.
[time=295] I'm late to spend Christmas with the one I love.
[time=298] How sweet, the one he loves.
[time=300] His mother?
[time=301] No, his wallet.
[time=302] (upbeat music)
[time=310] [MUSIC - 139 seconds]
[time=455] (audience applauds)
[time=463] - Good, you're all packed up.
[time=465] Kids, remember to tell your parents that Herod's will be open till 10 o'clock tonight.
[time=470] Ms. O'Reilly, will you please escort our guests somewhere else?
[time=474] - Where are we gonna go?
[time=476] - We plan to sing for hours, and it's only noon.
[time=479] - We were gonna sing at the store all day.
[time=481] We have no place to go.
[time=483] - Well, let me see.
[time=486] I know tonight there's a Christmas party at the light.
[time=488] How's the mission?
[time=489] I've been helping them, and I know they don't have any special music.
[time=494] Hey, would you guys be willing to come with me and help us out?
[time=497] - Yeah.
[time=498] - Oh, good.
[time=500] But how are we gonna get there?
[time=501] - Well, aren't we supposed to be the wise men?
[time=504] Let's figure this out.
[time=505] - Hey, we could take the camels.
[time=507] - We don't have camels.
[time=509] - What are you?
[time=510] - A wise guy?
[time=511] - Hey, we could take a plane.
[time=513] - We could take a train.
[time=514] - Or, since it's only down the block, we can just walk.
[time=519] - Okay, wise guys, since you didn't see the light, lead us to the lighthouse mission.
[time=523] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 129 seconds]
[time=657] (audience applauding) - Quiet down, Betsy, it's only me.
[time=665] - Hello, Miss Sally, Betsy.
[time=667] - Well, Miss O'Reilly.
[time=669] - Betsy, stop it, you'll scare them off.
[time=671] It's good to see you here so early.
[time=673] And who do you have with you on this fine Christmas Eve?
[time=675] - Oh, Miss Sally, I want you to meet my new friends.
[time=678] This is the Children's Choir from Calvary Community Church.
[time=681] Kids, this is Miss Sally.
[time=683] - Hi, Miss Sally.
[time=685] - Well, hello, Betsy and I welcome you to the Lighthouse Mission.
[time=688] - Miss Sally, they've offered to help us out and see in our party tonight.
[time=692] They even have their own major scene.
[time=694] - And you three, you must be the wise men.
[time=697] Oh, how Betsy and I love those wise men.
[time=700] They were so well-wise.
[time=703] - Really?
[time=704] I thought all they did was ride around on camels.
[time=706] - Oh, no, they wanted to find the king.
[time=708] So they packed up and left everything behind them and followed the star.
[time=713] - Kinda like they were walking in the light, right?
[time=715] - That's right.
[time=716] And they searched and searched for the baby Jesus.
[time=718] And when they finally found their king, they were overjoyed.
[time=722] Boys and girls, that's a secret.
[time=723] When you put Jesus first, you find real joy.
[time=753] - Oh.
[time=754] - The secret for a joyful attitude.
[time=757] But Jesus, then others, and then there's you.
[time=761] Surround for Jesus first, in all that you do.
[time=765] - I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart.
[time=771] Down in my heart, down in my heart.
[time=774] I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart.
[time=778] Down in my heart to stay.
[time=781] - Jesus, our Savior, our King.
[time=785] His love is kind, it's not the reason we sing.
[time=789] Oh, it's the rather than the people we meet.
[time=792] We'll be them.
[time=793] Jesus, by picking their needs.
[time=796] Why is it for you?
[time=797] And though it's not the last, we'll be first in the kingdom of God.
[time=805] Jesus, then others, and then there's you.
[time=809] The secret for a joyful attitude.
[time=812] But Jesus, then others, and then there's you.
[time=816] She left us, but Jesus first, in all that you do.
[time=819] But Jesus, then others, and then there's you.
[time=824] The secret for a joyful attitude.
[time=827] But Jesus, then others, and then there's you.
[time=830] To have joy, so Jesus first, in all that you do.
[time=843] To have joy.
[time=846] [APPLAUSE]
[time=849] Miss-- Miss O'Reilly, may I have a word with you, please?
[time=858] They told me I might find you right here.
[time=861] Look, the store was filled with last-minute shoppers with credit cards in hand.
[time=865] On top of that, I still haven't helped my mother decorate for Christmas.
[time=868] Look, I need you back at the store.
[time=870] Time is money, and turn yourself on on, so I can reach you, duh.
[time=874] Welcome to the Lighthouse mission.
[time=876] I am Miss Ellie, and this ferocious guard dog.
[time=878] It's my Betsy.
[time=879] She's tiny, but mighty.
[time=881] Yes, well, I am Mr. Herod of Hearst, the Barton store.
[time=885] Well, isn't that interesting?
[time=886] Did you know there's a Herod in the Christmas story, too?
[time=889] No.
[time=890] Kids, did you know there's a Herod?
[time=892] Now, Betsy, we're nice to everyone, even Herod.
[time=895] That's great.
[time=896] It's really, really nice.
[time=897] Anyways, Miss O'Reilly, five minutes.
[time=900] I need you back in the store in five minutes.
[time=904] Not a wise man that, Harry.
[time=906] Not a wise man.
[time=909] Miss O'Reilly, before you leave us, please tell us what happens next you know to the wise men.
[time=914] Remember, they wanted to find their king, and so they followed the light of the star.
[time=919] When they found baby Jesus, God's gift to us, they were filled with joy.
[time=924] Oh, I know what happens next.
[time=926] They entered into his presence.
[time=928] Yes, and then-- And they bowed down and worshipped him.
[time=931] We have come to meet you, humbly bow before you.
[time=943] We have come to seek your face.
[time=950] We have come to thank you.
[time=953] Worship and adore you.
[time=956] We have come to give you praise.
[time=962] For you have come to save us, born to dwell among us.
[time=969] You have come from God above.
[time=972] You have come to free us, rescue and redeem us.
[time=982] You have come to show us love.
[time=988] We bow down in your holy presence.
[time=994] Lift our voices in our song of praise.
[time=1001] Emmanuel has come to live among us.
[time=1007] Emmanuel has come to earth to light the way.
[time=1015] Like the wise men, when we enter into the presence of Jesus, we humbly bow our hearts and lives, and worship to our Savior and our King.
[time=1023] We bow down in your holy presence.
[time=1033] We lift our voices in our song of praise.
[time=1040] Emmanuel has come to live among us.
[time=1046] Emmanuel has come to earth to light the way.
[time=1063] [MUSIC]
[time=1066] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1069] Hello?
[time=1077] Oh, Mr. Herod.
[time=1079] Yes, sir?
[time=1080] No.
[time=1082] No, sir.
[time=1083] Uh-huh.
[time=1084] Oh, no.
[time=1086] No Christmas bonus?
[time=1088] Well, of course, sir, I understand.
[time=1090] Merry Christmas, you, too, sir.
[time=1093] What happened, Miss O'Reilly?
[time=1095] I didn't get back to the store in time, and I'm not going to get my Christmas bonus.
[time=1101] Oh, it's OK.
[time=1105] Really?
[time=1105] It's just that I was going to use my bonus by guest for the mission for tonight's party.
[time=1110] Well, honey, aren't you a sweetie?
[time=1115] You are willing to use your bonus here.
[time=1117] You've got a heart of gold.
[time=1118] Really, a heart of gold, Miss O'Reilly.
[time=1120] Gold, like the wise man's gift to the King.
[time=1122] Why, yes.
[time=1123] And we don't need a Christmas bonus to buy this gift.
[time=1125] What God would really like from each of us is a pure heart.
[time=1128] [MUSIC]
[time=1131] I too often think of things they only need.
[time=1140] And my actions grew up nearly all up free.
[time=1144] Now I can do it all now, or let your love us own.
[time=1149] We move from me this heart of gold.
[time=1154] We find out all that's left.
[time=1157] It's gold.
[time=1159] Heart of gold.
[time=1164] I want a heart of gold.
[time=1167] Heaven is a wonderful friend.
[time=1170] Like a strong hug, you go back.
[time=1172] Heart of gold.
[time=1173] I give you a heart of gold.
[time=1176] My life so I can shine.
[time=1178] I give you a heart of gold.
[time=1183] Heart of gold.
[time=1185] I give you a heart of gold.
[time=1188] Heaven is a wonderful friend.
[time=1190] Like a strong hug, you go back.
[time=1192] I give you a heart of gold.
[time=1197] My life so I can shine.
[time=1199] I give you a heart of gold.
[time=1204] You can do it all now.
[time=1206] I give you a heart of gold.
[time=1562] Hey, I've got an idea.
[time=1563] I know just how we can put this gift into practice.
[time=1592] I give you a heart of gold.
[time=2042] We're just glad you made it here tonight.
[time=2044] So am I. So am I.
[time=2048] How foolish I would be to turn away.
[time=2053] Four wise men still follow you today.
[time=2072] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2076] Bravo! Bravo! You kids were wonderful.
[time=2080] Next year I've got to have you seeing Harrods and Miss O'Reilly.
[time=2084] I want you to have that Christmas bonus after all.
[time=2086] Oh good, because she was going to use that money to buy gifts.
[time=2089] What?
[time=2090] She was going to buy gifts for all the kids here tonight.
[time=2093] Oh really?
[time=2094] Were you going to do that Miss O'Reilly?
[time=2096] We'll wait just one minute.
[time=2098] [MUSIC]
[time=2101] Hey Ernie, how many bikes and how many scooters do we have?
[time=2105] Okay, and how many dolls?
[time=2107] Good!
[time=2108] Wait, what's going on here?
[time=2110] Miss O'Reilly, I just figured out Christmas is all about.
[time=2113] All right, pack them up and get them right down here to the Lighthouse mission.
[time=2116] That's right, come in the front door and hang a right.
[time=2119] Hey Ernie, just meet me at the manger.
[time=2123] [MUSIC - 71 seconds]
[time=2198] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2203] Hey, let me just start this morning.
[time=2206] We're going to come back to this truth in a few minutes.
[time=2212] But let me start with this, then I want to say some things to you.
[time=2215] Just encourage you on a couple fronts, and then we're going to come back to this truth.
[time=2219] I don't think this will be on the screen, but let me just read it to you.
[time=2223] Philippians chapter two, verses five to seven.
[time=2228] Philippians chapter two, verses five, actually through eight.
[time=2234] Philippians two, five to eight.
[time=2237] It may not seem or sound Christmassy to you, but really, in every respect,
[time=2243] it's one of the most Christmas-centered passages you'll ever read.
[time=2249] And it goes like this, Philippians two, verses five to eight.
[time=2253] Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus,
[time=2259] who, although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God,
[time=2266] a thing to be grasped or held onto.
[time=2270] So he emptied himself.
[time=2273] It's Christmas, right there.
[time=2276] That's the birth of our Lord in a stable in the Middle East, right there.
[time=2282] But he emptied himself of all that he had been given, and all that he owned,
[time=2289] and all the rights and privileges that were his in his deity.
[time=2294] But he emptied himself, taking the form of a baby, taking the form of a bondservant,
[time=2300] and being made in the likeness of men, being found, verse eight, in appearance as a man,
[time=2306] he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, death even on a what?
[time=2313] Say it on a cross.
[time=2316] All right, we'll come back to that.
[time=2318] Let me just say right up front that for me personally, it seems to kind of always go this way,
[time=2326] at least in the last, oh gosh, you know, 17, 18 years or so of our lives in the bird family.
[time=2334] And I think even growing up it was this way, and I'm not saying this is bad at all.
[time=2337] I'm just saying so many times, whenever you start thinking about Christmas, you start thinking about kids.
[time=2344] You start always kind of trying to connect, how are we going to make it special?
[time=2348] What are we going to do? Where are we going to go?
[time=2351] So many times, kids and Christmas being special for kids and Christmas being fun for kids.
[time=2358] So many times, that's where we go in our minds.
[time=2361] That's, I think, sometimes just natural.
[time=2363] It's sometimes, I think, a little bit of culture.
[time=2365] But we oftentimes think about what kids need at Christmas.
[time=2369] Well, here's what I want you to think with me about this morning.
[time=2372] And I'm just going to just offer you some, what I'm going to offer you this morning really is maybe a little bit of opinion.
[time=2379] I think it's a little bit of truth, but it also is a little bit of opinion.
[time=2383] But I would like you, I'd like to invite you this morning to think with me about what kids really need at Christmas.
[time=2393] And I say it to you that way, because I think many of you in the room have the opportunity.
[time=2398] Many of us have been given the privilege to kind of give some direction here.
[time=2402] We've been given this unspeakable opportunity to speak into their lives and to love them and to lead them.
[time=2410] And some of us do it directly as parents.
[time=2413] Others of you in the room do it as grandparents.
[time=2416] Sometimes you do it as even an older sibling, maybe as an aunt or uncle.
[time=2421] But my friends, many of us in the room have the privilege in the next three weeks to offer some insight,
[time=2427] to offer some leadership to affect them as they take all this in.
[time=2432] So I thought we'd just talk for a few minutes about what kids really need at Christmas.
[time=2439] First thought, I wanted to share with you this morning is I think kids over the next three weeks,
[time=2446] I think over the rest of the weeks of the year they should feel like this.
[time=2451] But I just think there's something special about this season in the season I think kids should feel like they're a gift.
[time=2459] I think kids should feel like they're a gift and you've got a note sheet there you can fill this in as we go.
[time=2464] I think kids should feel like they're a gift.
[time=2468] And so it kind of begs the question, if a gift could speak, how would a gift say a gift feels?
[time=2477] What would a gift say to you if you asked the gift, "Hey gift, how do you feel at Christmas?"
[time=2486] I think gifts would probably tell you they feel special.
[time=2491] I think gifts would tell you that they'd say, "You know what, it seems like they're always kind of wanting to hold me.
[time=2496] It seems like four or five, six times a day somebody's coming under the tree and touching me.
[time=2502] They open me and it seems as if they really, really enjoy me."
[time=2512] And I think kids, your kids and my kids and any kid would get a chance to impact, should feel like a gift.
[time=2522] Now watch this, I think they should feel like a gift, special, not because of what you buy them,
[time=2528] not because of the toy you purchase or the phone you get them or the trip that you plan for them.
[time=2534] I think they should feel like a gift because of the time that you invest in them, because of the love that you offer them,
[time=2545] because of the relationship you're willing.
[time=2548] Maybe in the next three weeks, over and above all other weeks of the year, maybe the relationship you're willing to build with them.
[time=2557] And so I just want to practically ask you and I'm kind of practically asking myself at the same time, how willing will you be?
[time=2565] In these next couple of weeks, in these days to come, how willing will you be, dad, mom, older brother, older sister, grandma, grandpa and uncle,
[time=2578] how willing will you be to invest time, love and relationship?
[time=2587] And I don't really mean necessarily a movie in the dark for two hours.
[time=2594] I mean like, would you get on the floor and build something with your sleeves rolled up?
[time=2599] Would you go on a walk, would you draw a picture, would you read a book, would you do what maybe you normally don't do,
[time=2606] but would you go above and beyond?
[time=2609] In the next couple of two or three weeks to make a statement to that little boy or girl that they mean more to you than anything,
[time=2618] and that you'll sacrifice your time, you'll adjust your schedule, you'll do things that maybe you don't normally do,
[time=2624] and maybe they would become things you would normally do after you begin to make an effort in the next few weeks that you didn't normally make.
[time=2633] Does that make sense?
[time=2636] Be creative, be bold, be courageous, be, get outside of the box that's been you with that kid or those kids for maybe years,
[time=2647] and communicate with them by virtue of your willingness to be with them and doing things that count and matter,
[time=2656] communicate to them how what we say, how special they are, that you want to hold them, you want to touch them, you want to open them up,
[time=2667] and you want to enjoy them, I think kids should feel like a gift.
[time=2672] Second thing, I wrote down, I think kids, I think my kids, I think your kids, today especially, I think kids today need to be taught the value of giving.
[time=2687] The value of giving sounds pretty common, I know, I want to say it to you this morning though in this way,
[time=2694] oftentimes with Christmas, and this is something that I do, it's something that many of you do, we've passed it along to our kids.
[time=2702] Again, it's cultural and it's also kind of very personal, but here's what happens at Christmas.
[time=2707] First of December ish, people start making out their lists, where did this come from?
[time=2719] Where did list making come from?
[time=2725] And I'm not trying to vilify it, hear me out here, I'm not trying to go hyper-spiritual on you, I just want you to bear with me here and think this through.
[time=2733] At a very foundational level, here's what we've in essence taught them, and here's what in essence we've been practicing.
[time=2740] I'm going to make a list, and on this list I am going to write down the things that I want.
[time=2751] I know, emphasis added kind of communicates, but you with me? I'm going to make a list of what I want, I'm going to make a list of what I'd like to get.
[time=2763] I'm going to make a list of what you, person who I give the list to, I'm going to make a list of the things I want you to give to me.
[time=2772] And see somewhere in there, I think a message gets communicated, and somewhere in there, you and I and our kids begin to think about, more often than not, in the midst of the season, what we're going to get.
[time=2786] And what if, here's a crazy thought, what if today we all went home with our kids young and old?
[time=2797] And this isn't just about our kids, this is about you and me as well, but what if we went home?
[time=2802] And what if we kind of put aside old lists, maybe like two weeks old, what if we put aside old lists and what if we made new lists?
[time=2810] And what if your kids this time around in '09 made a list, and on that list you helped them write down the names of some people that they love, some people that they care about, some people that they want to bless.
[time=2824] And what if next to those names on that list you helped them just write down, and it could be really, really simple, it could be really, really complex and fun, but what if you helped them make a list of what they wanted to give?
[time=2838] How they wanted to bless that person, how they wanted to encourage them, it could be a note, it could be a present, it could be a job done that needed to give, it could be anything, but what if we helped our kids make new lists
[time=2852] that had everything in the world to do with others and not as much to do with them?
[time=2861] Good idea, bad idea, I don't know, just a thought.
[time=2866] I hope you'll do it.
[time=2868] I think Janice, maybe even with the kids this morning in Sunday school, maybe even provided them with little lists, little sheets of paper that they can take home and you can help them make a new list.
[time=2879] I think kids need to feel like a gift, I think kids should be taught the value of giving.
[time=2888] I'd love for you to help them make a list, I'd love for you to talk about that with them, that's your take home on that one, your take home on number one is make some time.
[time=2900] Make some time this week to do something above and beyond out of the ordinary in terms of an investment of time and love and relationship.
[time=2909] Secondly, sit down with them and make a new list, I think it'd be fun.
[time=2914] Thirdly, and this is basic, I think this is real basic for some, but to be quite honest I think it may be a new challenge for others and I think it's just something we all should be mindful of.
[time=2926] The Bible speaks at length, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago at Thanksgiving, the Bible speaks at length to the issue of the gratitude and the thankfulness that a believer should possess.
[time=2941] Being thankful is a good thing and I think that we need to teach our kids, I think all of us could probably use a little primer, a little reminder on helping our kids be grateful kids.
[time=2955] I have a nightmare that runs through my mind every once in a while, I don't know who the kid is and the nightmare, it might be yours, it could be mine, doesn't really matter who's it is, but the nightmare is just this kid running into the, I don't know, I think it's the relatives house and the door opens and the kid just buzzes right past the grandma on the grandpa and races to the tree and sits down next to the presence and says where's the presence?
[time=2984] You know and there's this kid and he's just got this kind of glazed look on his eyes and before you know it, presence are kind of getting put in front of him and he's ripping paper off presence and papers going this way and presence are getting looked at and tossed and where's the next one and this kid's just ripping through
[time=2999] the present after present, after present paper, gifts, glazed look, anybody feeling this with me? We got to be careful, we got to be really, really careful with our kids.
[time=3015] What we've got to do I think is slow them down, young ones and older ones alike, slow down and think about what's going on here, somebody took the time to give you a gift.
[time=3031] Somebody took the time to wrap it, somebody took the time to write you a note, somebody took the time to be thoughtful and we've got to help our kids not only feel grateful, because I think many times they are grateful inside.
[time=3044] We've got to help them externally communicate it.
[time=3048] Make sense? We've got to help them stop and go across a room or go to the other end of the couch and we've got to help them look, we've got to help them look people in the eye, I think that's helpful, to look people in the eye.
[time=3061] It might be a family member so maybe you give them a hug, it may be a friend so you give them a good shake, but one way or the other we need to express our gratitude, show our gratitude,
[time=3073] say thank you, say it slowly, give a hug, go back, sit down, take a deep breath and wait your turn.
[time=3082] Make sense? I think our kids need help. I think you and I can help them become more grateful and more meaningful in their expression of it.
[time=3094] Those are just practical things. I hope it's helpful. I really believe it's needed, but here's the thing I want to make sure that we talk about today.
[time=3103] I think fourthly, I think your kids and mine should understand, I think you're four-year-old, five-year-old, six-year-old all the way up to your 13, 14, 15-year-old should understand,
[time=3122] really understand and not just understand, but be able to articulate and communicate the story, the great redeeming, life-changing, eternity-altering story of Christmas.
[time=3138] Most kids understand the manger. Most kids get the animals and the hay. A lot of kids even get Joseph and Mary, but we got to help our kids understand the fuller, more redemptive story of what God did in sending his son.
[time=3157] Here's what I would invite you to do with your kids this week, young ones and old ones. And I'm trying to keep this as I thought it through, trying to keep it as practical and simple as possible.
[time=3168] I think kids oftentimes are visual. I think you can help kids by drawing them a picture. And so here's what I've been working on. I think you could do it like this.
[time=3178] I think you need to sit down with a napkin or a placemat or a notebook sheet of paper and say, "Hey, let's talk about what Christmas is really about. What is the real story of Christmas?" And as it is with anything, I think the story always begins with God.
[time=3196] And in this case, it gives you an opportunity to remind them that in the scope of things in this world and life of ours, the great dilemma is that God, and here's a really bad man.
[time=3208] I mean, he's bad because he's sinful, but he's badly drawn if you know what I was trying to say there.
[time=3214] You've got God and you've got man. And it's okay for them to begin to understand early on that the great dilemma in life is the separation that exists between God and man because God is holy and man is not.
[time=3228] So you've got God and you've got man. And you tell him, "Here's the story of Christmas. The story of Christmas is this. The story of Christmas is really John 3, 16."
[time=3242] And you just draw that form. And maybe you open your Bible and you take them there that God, that God so loved the world that he gave.
[time=3253] We think about John 3, 16 and the crucifixion. Oftentimes you ask any kid about John 3, 16, they think about the crucifixion.
[time=3261] John 3, 16, really. When it talks about a loving Heavenly Father who loved the world so much that he gave, well, he gave his son, and this is the great truth here.
[time=3272] John 3, 16, "For God so loved the world, separated from him by their sin, he loved him so much he gave his son, his only begotten son."
[time=3283] And this is where Christmas comes in. But let me say it to you this way. Christmas, we'll go. I drew a really bad star. Boy, it was bad. First hour, I was really embarrassed.
[time=3296] Is that bad or is that better? You weren't here. What do you know? Just say it was great. Thank you.
[time=3306] So God so loved the world that he gave in that manger and that stable. He gave his son. But I think it's important that kids at 4, 5, 6 begin to understand.
[time=3318] And I really mean this. I think they should always associate Christmas with the cross. They're inseparable. It's all there.
[time=3329] God so loved the world that he gave his only son. And yes, he gave his only son, and the star of Bethlehem, and the manger, and the wise men, and the stable, and all of that plays into it.
[time=3341] But kids need to understand early, and you get to teach them that God gave Jesus to man, that Jesus was born to, what? Die.
[time=3353] And that's the unspeakable gift. That's the head scratching truth. That's the, you've got to be kidding me, that God gave his boy, gave him so that he could be born, so that he could die, so that you and I could have forgiveness and life eternal.
[time=3372] This is the great story of Christmas that God so loved the world that he gave his only son, yes, with the star and with the cross. And in that death and resurrection, then provides a way for man, you and I, having been redeemed, having been saved, that's a smile, to live in eternity with God.
[time=3396] Now that took a few minutes, and the drawing's not that great, but you're better at that than I am, and you could draw that thing, and you could take them through it step by step, and they could understand it, and they could draw it, and they could say it, and you know what?
[time=3412] When you and I visit that truth with them often enough, and when you and I live out that truth often enough with them, when you and I give ourselves to lives that are inundated with this truth, they begin to understand it.
[time=3428] And they begin to in time own it, and in time it begins to be theirs. That happens when you and I take the time, maybe over the next three weeks, to get a piece of paper out and a pen and help them understand the great redeeming truth of Christmas.
[time=3444] And I got to say to you this morning, I got to say to the whole room today, I get to, what a privilege for me, to say to this entire room filled with people, many of whom I know, but some of whom I don't, and you may be here this morning and you may be exploring Christianity.
[time=3463] You may be giving thought to what it means biblically to fully surrender and devote your heart and life to Christ. You may be engaged in that journey, kind of on your own, kind of privately.
[time=3476] You may be very engaged with someone here in our family who has been kind enough to kind of walk alongside you over the last few weeks or months or who knows years.
[time=3488] But I get to say to you this morning, my friend, this is, this is the great truth of Christmas. And I wonder if you have opened that gift, I wonder if you have come to the place where you've realized your separation from him.
[time=3503] The need that's there for that sin to be forgiven and for meaningful life today and eternal life someday to be offered and grasped and experienced.
[time=3514] I hope you won't go, whoever you might be. I hope you won't go these next two, three weeks and not bow the knee of your heart and surrender yourself to him.
[time=3533] You
