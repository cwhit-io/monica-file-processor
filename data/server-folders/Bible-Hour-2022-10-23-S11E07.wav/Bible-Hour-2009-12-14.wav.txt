[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] We're thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=36] And as you watch this broadcast today, for most of you, it will be Sunday, December 27th.
[time=42] And the 27th of December has kind of a nice ring to it.
[time=46] And for all of us, the Christmas holiday has passed and what a great celebration that was for us.
[time=53] And now we look forward to a new year.
[time=56] And I wanna just say something to all of you who are watching this morning.
[time=60] I know that there are many of you who watch today and you find yourself in a place where you are grateful.
[time=66] Life is for you good.
[time=68] And as you look forward to a new year, you can't wait to continue to experience all the goodness and joy that God has allowed you to experience in your life.
[time=79] But there are others of you who are watching this morning and for you, it might not be so good.
[time=85] Truth be told in all honesty, you're looking forward to a new year and you find deep in your heart and soul, the realization that you could use some help.
[time=95] You need a new year.
[time=96] You need more than a new year.
[time=98] You need a new direction.
[time=101] You need a new sense of hope and forgiveness.
[time=105] You need new friends.
[time=107] You need a new family.
[time=109] You need a new opportunity to maybe make some progress and maybe move in a new direction that would finally allow there to be in your life the meaning that you always thought you could have an experience.
[time=123] And I want to say to you this morning, however discouraged you might be, however alone you might feel, I want to say to you loud and clear there is a new life for you that you can have.
[time=135] There is a new direction and there is new hope and that new life and that new hope and that new direction and that new forgiveness is found in the person of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ whose birth we just celebrated.
[time=150] And I want to say to you this morning that you can come and you can find that new hope and that new life in a place like Blackhawk where we would love nothing more than to befriend you and come alongside you and introduce you to the life-changing eternity-altering truth of God's Word and God's Son and God's Spirit.
[time=171] And I tell you what, we're not a perfect place, we're not a perfect people, but we are a family that loves the privilege of introducing others to this newfound opportunity, this newfound life in Jesus Christ.
[time=185] So with a new year coming, why don't you come and give us the privilege and the opportunity of coming alongside you and encouraging you in the days to come.
[time=194] We'll be here this coming Sunday, 9 and 10.45 on Sunday mornings, opportunities throughout the week that we'd love to tell you about and help you get connected to.
[time=205] But just know how thankful we are for a new year and a chance to come alongside friends like you and give you the new sense of encouragement and that new sense of direction that so many of you need.
[time=216] Okay, God bless you.
[time=217] Thank you for tuning in today.
[time=219] I hope your heart is encouraged and as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=315] (audience applauds)
[time=321] - Emmanuel God with us.
[time=326] I counted yesterday how many times we're gonna sing that over you today.
[time=332] It totals 92.
[time=333] Emmanuel is a name of our God that we sing this time of year because it reminds us of Christ coming to earth.
[time=343] John chapter one says that the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=349] That's Emmanuel God with us.
[time=351] God incarnate showed up and therefore he was Emmanuel.
[time=356] Those of you in the room who like me have put your hope and your trust in Jesus and claimed him to be the center of your life.
[time=364] Know what I'm talking about when I reference Colossians 1 and Paul says that Christ is in us, the hope of glory.
[time=373] And to me, Emmanuel doesn't just mean God showed up but God dwells in me.
[time=379] He isn't just God with us but he can be God within us if you accept him as the Lord and savior of your life.
[time=386] That song that you just saw and heard is one of our favorites.
[time=391] We've been practicing it for weeks and have enjoyed learning it and meditating on its truths.
[time=398] And the song said that Emmanuel was the miracle with us.
[time=403] And if you'd think with me just for a little bit about how miraculous Christ's birth is, every birth is absolutely miraculous.
[time=413] Yesterday I got to hold a new baby girl, a friend of ours, just had a baby girl and she was tiny, only five pounds.
[time=420] And I got to hold her in my arms and watch her breathe on her own.
[time=425] Her heart was beating, her digestive system was working, kidneys filtering, voice box cooing and crying and communicating everything that she needed to live and grow to her parents so that they could know how to raise her night and day she was cooing and crying and making those needs known.
[time=446] So every birth is absolutely miraculous.
[time=449] How in the world is something that tiny, able to function on its own, it's beautiful, it's a miracle.
[time=455] So Jesus' birth, like that, was just intrinsically miraculous.
[time=459] But as you'll observe, when we look at these passages, it was also prophetically miraculous.
[time=465] And what I mean by prophetically God sent messages to his chosen people in the Old Testament and he told them this is how it's gonna play out.
[time=473] And he said it thousands of years before it happened.
[time=475] He told them this is how my Messiah's gonna come.
[time=478] This is how the Savior of the world is gonna show up.
[time=481] Look at this on the screen.
[time=484] It talks in the Old Testament in Jeremiah 23 about the Messiah coming from the house of King David.
[time=492] God made that promise.
[time=493] He said the days are coming and I'm gonna raise up for you a Messiah from the line of David.
[time=498] And then in Luke chapter three, we get a glimpse of Jesus' genealogy and it says that Mary was from the line of David.
[time=505] Therefore Jesus was from the line of David.
[time=508] God told them in Micah chapter five verse two, he said I'm gonna raise up for you in this little town of Bethlehem, a mighty king who is gonna rule.
[time=517] And you know what's really cool?
[time=518] In Luke chapter two, Mary and Joseph didn't live in Bethlehem.
[time=522] So God was sovereignly moving the pieces of the puzzle so that Mary and Joseph would be and Bethlehem at the time that Jesus was born and fulfilling his own promise that it would be out of Bethlehem, that their Messiah would come.
[time=535] God promised in Isaiah four, excuse me, and Isaiah seven, that Mary would be a virgin.
[time=543] Isaiah seven, 14 says the virgin will be with child.
[time=546] Talk about a miracle.
[time=548] And it's fulfilled when Matthew writes in the first chapter of his gospel.
[time=552] Before Mary and Joseph came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
[time=558] A couple of other places where God's promises come true in the Christmas story.
[time=564] He said in Psalm 72 verses nine and 10 that shepherds were gonna come and worship him and he said that kings were gonna come and worship him and he didn't just say they would be kings, he said they'd be kings with gifts.
[time=576] And I bet you all know the story.
[time=578] In Luke chapter two, we see those shepherds who were abiding their flocks by night and they dropped what they were doing and they went and they worshiped the baby Jesus and the kings, they brought with them not only their presence of royalty but their gifts of gold and frankincense and Mer outlined there in Matthew chapter two.
[time=596] So absolutely miraculous Jesus' birth, not just intrinsically miraculous but prophetically miraculous.
[time=603] Everything God said would happen, happened.
[time=606] I learned this this week and I thought you'd find it interesting too.
[time=611] Several years ago back in 1969, there was a mathematician who was a professor, his name is Peter Stoner and he asked his math students to do a little problem solving thing, something I couldn't do.
[time=626] He took eight Old Testament prophecies concerning the person of Jesus and he said, "Class, what are the odds that all eight of these things would actually happen in one person?" And so they did their math and I don't really know what it was.
[time=638] He just picked eight of the 333 prophecies about the person of Jesus.
[time=644] Some of those eight that Peter Stoner used, he said, "You know, what are the odds of one man being born in Bethlehem and then also being preceded by a messenger, also riding on a donkey that also was betrayed by a friend and sold for 30 pieces of silver." He picked eight.
[time=662] And so they did the math and they figured out the odds and it's pretty incredible.
[time=666] The odds that one person would fulfill those eight were one in 10 to the 17th power.
[time=673] I think a number's gonna come up on the screen to kind of show you.
[time=676] That's a 10 with 17 zeros behind it so that makes it one and one quintillion.
[time=683] Did I say that right?
[time=684] Chance that God's word would be fulfilled in one person and that was just eight.
[time=691] Imagine if they would have done the math for all 333.
[time=694] So Jesus' birth, a miracle.
[time=697] Look at Isaiah chapter 40 with me.
[time=701] It's gonna come up on the screen.
[time=703] Some of my favorite verses here, "Every valley shall be raised up.
[time=708] "Every mountain and hill made low.
[time=709] "The rough ground shall become level.
[time=712] "The rugged places a plain "and the glory of the Lord will be revealed.
[time=717] "And all mankind together will see it "for the mouth of the Lord has spoken." This first basically says that nothing is gonna stand in the way of God showing off his glory, including his glory in the birth and the person of his son, Jesus.
[time=734] Nothing will stand in the way of his miracle.
[time=738] If it's a mountain in the way, squashing.
[time=740] If it's a valley that makes it too difficult, raise it up.
[time=744] If the ground is too rough, God's gonna smooth it out.
[time=747] If it's too rugged, make it into a plain.
[time=750] God's saying, "Nothing will stand in my way." And it shouldn't.
[time=756] The maker of all things most certainly cannot be limited by anything.
[time=762] Marsha quoted from Romans at the beginning of that song, we just sang, and I wanna look at that with you.
[time=769] Two Romans, eight, verses 38 and 39.
[time=772] I am convinced, and I hope you are too, that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor death, nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[time=793] Would you pray with me?
[time=800] God, this season of the year, we would be remiss to ponder your love in the birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=808] And we think about the truth that you shared with us and Romans eight from your heart about how nothing will separate us from that love, not height and depth, not time and space, not angelic or demonic powers, nothing God will separate us from your love.
[time=823] And you demonstrated that to us when you squashed the mountains and raised the valleys and moved out the rugged places so that your King of glory could come in just like you said he would, from a virgin in Bethlehem, worshiped by shepherds, worshiped by kings from the line of David.
[time=840] God, may we put our hope in your unfailing love.
[time=846] And God, when we watch the Christmas story unfold may not just remind us that you will fulfill and complete every promise that you make.
[time=857] God, would you increase our faith this Christmas?
[time=860] And would you help us trust that nothing will ever separate us from your love?
[time=867] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=870] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 131 seconds]
[time=1008] (audience applauding)
[time=1018] - What an amazing truth that he would flatten mountains and raise up valleys and make rough places smooth in an effort to get to you, amen?
[time=1030] He loved you that much.
[time=1032] And I know for many of you in the room, many of you in the room, you've never experienced that kind of love.
[time=1040] And this season and the great truth of this season that our God in heaven loved you that much, that he gave up as much as he did and he went to the links that he went to to make it possible and real.
[time=1052] I know for you it's a special time and I know how grateful you are.
[time=1058] It's amazing when you think about it and when you experience the different responses to Christmas, I've been the last four or five months again and I'll emphasize the word again.
[time=1070] I hope this one lasts like I'm sure you do.
[time=1073] Many of you are in my shoes.
[time=1075] I started working out again and I'm trying my best to do the same thing many of you do.
[time=1082] I'm just trying to watch what I eat.
[time=1085] I tend to watch too much of what I eat as I'm eating it, but I'm just trying to watch what I eat.
[time=1092] I'm trying to exercise.
[time=1094] I'm just trying to, you know, nothing like extreme, but I'm trying to stay faithful to it.
[time=1100] I get excited, you know.
[time=1101] There's a part of me that thinks I've accomplished something when I see a son who's graduating from high school.
[time=1107] You get a sense of accomplishment.
[time=1109] You kind of take a deep breath.
[time=1110] You start to think, gosh, I made it and then you look back and you see 14, 12, nine and eight looking at you going, hey, it's our turn.
[time=1117] And I got a decade I figure ahead of me of throwing the ball and chasing stuff down and running here and there.
[time=1123] So I'm trying to be physically healthy, you know.
[time=1126] So all that to say, I find, you know, myself early mornings, several days a week, I'm over at a fitness place and I'm just working out and meeting people and I love that part of it.
[time=1138] You know me, you know, it's just fun to meet people.
[time=1140] So anyway, there I am back in the guys locker room a couple of weeks ago.
[time=1146] And I'm just seeing who God may have for me to reach and maybe build a friendship with.
[time=1151] And there's a guy sitting next to me.
[time=1153] So I say, hey, just to ask them a simple question.
[time=1155] I say, hey, what do you do?
[time=1156] We were talking, I said, so what do you do with your days?
[time=1158] And what's Christmas like the season like for you and what you do?
[time=1164] And he looked, he's early in the morning.
[time=1165] I talked too much.
[time=1166] I think people are annoyed at me for talking so much early in the morning.
[time=1170] He looked up at me, he says, I'll tell you what.
[time=1172] He says, in my line of work, and he said what line of work it was, in my line of work, Christmas is nothing more than a pain in the-- and he said it.
[time=1183] You know, the backside.
[time=1185] And he looked at me without skipping a beat.
[time=1187] And he said, what do you do?
[time=1188] What's Christmas like for you?
[time=1193] And so I-- so we had a great conversation.
[time=1197] He woke up quick, and we had a good talk.
[time=1202] But it got me thinking about it.
[time=1203] Everybody's got a response to Christmas.
[time=1208] Everybody's got a response.
[time=1210] It evokes something in all of us.
[time=1213] And as I thought about that more and more, I went to where I always go.
[time=1217] I just went to the scriptures and began to think about the responses that we see in God's Word.
[time=1224] And I started with, as we oftentimes do, I started there in Luke.
[time=1228] And I looked at Luke chapter 2, and you see there in Luke.
[time=1231] It's probably a little too dark in the room.
[time=1233] So you may not be able to read your own Bibles.
[time=1235] But let me read it to you.
[time=1236] We see the response of the angels.
[time=1239] There was an angel who came to the shepherds.
[time=1242] But not long after he speaks, he's joined by what the scriptures say are a multitude of angels.
[time=1249] And they're responding to what is about to happen.
[time=1251] And in Luke 2, 13, it says, and suddenly, they're appeared with the angel, a multitude of the heavenly host, a multitude of the heavenly host.
[time=1261] I've told you this before.
[time=1262] Some of you may not know this, that numerically, the way that's phrased, what it's saying is there were too many to count.
[time=1270] There would be too many to even make an account of.
[time=1275] Are you with me?
[time=1276] Millions, millions and millions.
[time=1279] I mean, beyond whatever we could imagine, too many to count, the angels fill the sky.
[time=1287] And there's a multitude.
[time=1289] They cover the sky.
[time=1290] They're everywhere.
[time=1292] And they're uncountable.
[time=1295] And this multitude of the heavenly hosts are praising God.
[time=1299] There's the response of the angels.
[time=1301] They're praising God and saying glory to God in the highest.
[time=1306] And on earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased.
[time=1310] They understood the significance of this.
[time=1313] And they praise God.
[time=1315] They sing to God.
[time=1317] They are adoring God with the angels.
[time=1321] This is the response that we get.
[time=1324] We can stay right there in that chapter and look at the response of the shepherds.
[time=1328] If you just keep going there in verse 15, when the angels had gone away from them, when the angels had gone away from the shepherds there on that hillside into heaven, the shepherds began saying to each other, let us go straight to Bethlehem then and see this thing that has happened.
[time=1346] See this thing that maybe happened?
[time=1351] No, the shepherds' responses is right on point.
[time=1355] I mean, the shepherds' response is immediate.
[time=1357] They believe what has transpired.
[time=1359] They believe it to be true.
[time=1361] And they say, let's go right now.
[time=1363] It's amazing shepherds were in that day, you know, the bottom rung, my friends.
[time=1368] There wasn't a group of individuals any lower than them on the socio-economic ladder.
[time=1375] Socially and personally and reputation wise, the shepherds were the dregs of society.
[time=1382] They weren't liked most often times.
[time=1385] They didn't have anything.
[time=1387] Most of them didn't have families.
[time=1390] They literally spent their days and their nights in the fields.
[time=1393] They weren't respected.
[time=1394] They weren't admired, but they had one job and that was to take care of their sheep.
[time=1399] And it's amazing how they leave their sheep.
[time=1403] It's the one thing they have to do.
[time=1405] It's the one thing they're responsible for and they leave it and they say, let's go right away to see what has occurred and watch what they do.
[time=1416] I always just marvel at this.
[time=1418] So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph and the baby as he lay in the manger.
[time=1424] In verse 17, when they had seen this, they made not, when they, the shepherds, the dregs of society, the bottom wrong of the socioeconomic ladder, who nobody listens to, who nobody cares about.
[time=1436] When they see, when they saw this, they made known in the original language there, this speaks to a verbal proclamation.
[time=1446] They made known these shepherds, the statement which had been told them about this child.
[time=1453] They had been told that this was the Savior who is Christ the Lord, and so they begin to repeat this.
[time=1460] They begin to proclaim this.
[time=1461] And verse 18, and all who heard it, wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.
[time=1469] But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart.
[time=1473] The shepherds went back glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.
[time=1484] Angels praise and sing and adore the shepherds.
[time=1487] These recluse shepherds become public evangelists.
[time=1491] They can't keep their mouth shut in obedience and in faithfulness and in humble response.
[time=1499] They go, they see and they speak.
[time=1502] They open their mouths and they tell people the truth about Jesus.
[time=1507] The wise men, we learn a lot about the wise men here in the scriptures and you can study for yourself the great truth behind them.
[time=1515] These wise men came from Persia more than likely.
[time=1519] They were magicians, they were sorcerers, they were men who had heard about the prophecy of Daniel and this king who would come.
[time=1528] And I want you to realize that as you look at the postcards and as you look at the nativity scenes, and as you think about all that you've learned and experienced and seen in the wise men and how they're depicted, I want you to realize just a couple of things in their response.
[time=1544] They came a long way.
[time=1546] It probably took months for them.
[time=1550] They left family, they left friends, they left responsibilities and they traveled.
[time=1556] They gave of their time, they gave of their energy, they gave of their resources.
[time=1562] And on the resource front, I want you to understand that gold frankincense and myrrh wasn't found in a crackerjack box.
[time=1570] These were gifts, my friends.
[time=1572] It cost them.
[time=1575] They gave from their resources in a sacrificial and significant way.
[time=1581] They traveled and gave of their time and their efforts to come and respond to this baby who was born.
[time=1588] The angels praised the news.
[time=1591] They sang and adored.
[time=1592] The shepherds responded immediately in obedience and they became mouthpieces for the gospel.
[time=1600] I think about Mary herself.
[time=1602] As you read the response of Mary in the scriptures, you see a deep gratitude in her heart.
[time=1608] She can't fathom how it is that she would be chosen by God to bear the Messiah and bring hope and forgiveness to her people.
[time=1615] She's humbled in her response.
[time=1618] You sense and see her devotion to him.
[time=1621] You go back and you read through there in Luke, in Luke chapter one.
[time=1627] I've told you this before, but when you look at Mary's, the magnificat, when you go through Mary's response to this news of what will transpire, there almost isn't a word of it that's hers.
[time=1641] Most all of it is her restating from the Old Testament.
[time=1646] The prophecies and the promises that God had made.
[time=1649] She was a devoted young lady who knew the word of God.
[time=1655] And it was the word of God in that devotion that comes out of her.
[time=1659] When she hears the news, her response is one of truth.
[time=1663] Her response is one of devotion.
[time=1666] I think about Zacharias and his response in Luke 168.
[time=1671] Luke 168, Zacharias, the son of John, the Baptist, who was the forerunner to Christ.
[time=1678] Now his mouth is opened.
[time=1680] You saw last week his mouth get taped shut.
[time=1683] Now it's open and he says in Luke 168, "The blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, for he has visited us and accomplished redemption for his people and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David, his servant in the midst of all that there was to take in Zacharias understood and his response was one that clearly saw the great gift of salvation and redemption.
[time=1711] He got angels who praised him and sang and adored him.
[time=1716] What a great response.
[time=1717] You have the shepherds who in obedience go and see him and begin to articulate the good news of his coming.
[time=1724] You have wise men who gave valuable gifts and sacrificed enormous amounts of personal time and travel, Mary, deep gratitude and devotion, Zacharias, salvation, redemption.
[time=1738] The scriptures are clear, my friends.
[time=1742] The birth of Jesus, the first coming of Christ had a way of evoking in people a response.
[time=1748] For most, it was a response of, and if I just kind of put all that together, what we just kind of talked through briefly, for most, the response was one of worship.
[time=1759] They worshiped this great truth.
[time=1762] It meant so much to them.
[time=1764] It was so significant.
[time=1766] They understood the implications of it.
[time=1769] And then I stopped and thought about it.
[time=1772] There was one that we know of, I'm sure there were others, but there was one who in this story, his response wasn't worshipful.
[time=1781] Again, we saw him last week, and that was King Herod.
[time=1786] So many worshipful responses except for his, Herod's response was one of contempt.
[time=1791] Some were deeply grateful and amazed at the news of Christ's coming.
[time=1796] He was threatened by even the mention of another king,
[time=1802] another ruler, someone else who would be in control.
[time=1806] For many of that day, they knew, and they sensed their need for a savior.
[time=1811] He, Herod, he was enough for himself.
[time=1816] For Herod, he himself was all he needed.
[time=1820] Maybe this morning, you know someone like that.
[time=1824] Maybe this morning, you're like that.
[time=1831] Maybe you're here in the room, maybe you're watching on the broadcast, you may be listening online, and the truth is your response to the birth of our king.
[time=1840] Leads you wondering what it would be like to have another king in your life, someone else ruling.
[time=1849] Maybe for you, you've grown accustomed to you being all you need.
[time=1854] Well, there were so many here in this story who understood so much more, for many who had known the prophecies and had waited to be rescued and redeemed, the birth of Messiah was a gift, a blessing, a joy.
[time=1871] For Herod, the news of one who would rule in righteousness was a burden.
[time=1878] He saw him as a rival that he then attempted to squelch.
[time=1883] In that day, there were those who allowed themselves to be deeply affected by the spiritual truth and the spiritual implication of Christ's birth.
[time=1894] And for two weeks now, we've been doing our very best to just stop and remind every one of us of those spiritual implications.
[time=1901] And I'll just do it again briefly because I know that there are those of you in the room this morning and you've been tracking with us for two weeks and you've been thinking about these things personally, intimately.
[time=1911] For the first time, some of you, ever in your life, the fact that we celebrate this season, the birth of a Christ who came and did away with the distance between you and God.
[time=1927] See, we've learned over the last several weeks that sin separates us from him in our humanness, our sin distances us from God and God and his redeeming love, God who would not be separated, God who we sang about earlier, this God who loved us and sent his son to die for us, John 3 16 in Ephesians 2, out of his great mercy and love, sends his boy to be born a stable, sends his boy to live a perfect life, sends his boy to be misunderstood and tortured and murdered and hung on a cross and thrown into a tomb, God who loves you sends his son to defeat death, walk out of that tomb three days later so you and I could be saved and redeemed and have eternal life.
[time=1972] Meaningful life today and eternal life with God someday.
[time=1976] This is the gospel, this is the truth, this is the good news of Christmas.
[time=1982] There are those of you in the room this morning and you've received, you've welcomed, you've embraced that good news.
[time=1991] There are others just like they're worth in.
[time=1994] These two responses are still with us today.
[time=1998] Some worship, some are indifferent, some adore, some are annoyed.
[time=2004] For some Christmas is all about salvation, redemption for others, it's not.
[time=2010] And I want to just ask you this morning, what's your response to this great celebration that we celebrate today?
[time=2018] What's your response, what goes on?
[time=2021] I'm asking you in your heart, what is your response to the gift of Christ?
[time=2029] We all respond, you can't not respond.
[time=2034] In your indifference, in your non-response, you respond.
[time=2040] And our hope for you, my hope for you personally, is that maybe this could be a Christmas for you like none other, that this could be a Christmas where you personally says in Romans 9, if you believe in you, if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart, Jesus is Lord, you will be saved, and my hope and my prayer is that you would do that maybe even this morning.
[time=2063] Oh Father, what an honor it is to be called, your children.
[time=2068] What an honor it is to be loved by you today.
[time=2070] Thank you for walking with us.
[time=2074] Thank you for never leaving us, never forsaking us, never abandoning us, never divorcing us.
[time=2081] You are Emmanuel, you are God with us, and we are grateful.
[time=2089] [MUSIC - 295 seconds]
[time=2389] Imagine standing in a field when an angel of the Lord comes and says,
[time=2408] "Fear not, the Savior, the Messiah, the Lord is born today in Bethlehem."
[time=2415] How would you respond to that?
